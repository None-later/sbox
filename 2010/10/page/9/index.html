<p>Mike Kimel <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/10/empirical-look-at-us-economy-from.html">just remarked </a>that Keynes was in no way responsible for the incorrect impression that the Phillips curve graphs the set of unemployment and inflation rates available to policy makers.  In a comment, I said he was totally correct.   In fact, I&#8217;d go further and argued that Keynes warned against that mistake as clearly as he could given the disadvantage that he was writing decades before Phillips.</p>
<p>Also Mark Thoma has twice linked to my pathbreaking effor to study the history of eonomic thought by cutting and pasting from &#8220;The General Theory &#8230;.&#8221; </p>
<p>Said cutting and pasting after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;Chapter 21. The Theory of Prices &#8220;</p>
<p>Contains the warning against the temptation to use a Phillips curve to come up with a theory of aggregate supply to go along with the theory of aggregate demand presented in chapters 1-18.  </p>
<blockquote><p>That the wage-unit may tend to rise before full employment has been reached, requires little comment or explanation. Since each group of workers will gain, cet. par. , by a rise in its own wages, there is naturally for all groups a pressure in this direction, which entrepreneurs will be more ready to meet when they are doing better business. For this reason a proportion of any increase in effective demand is likely to be absorbed in satisfying the upward tendency of the wage-unit.</p>
<p>Thus, &#8230; , we have a succession of &#8230; points at which an increasing effective demand tends to raise money-wages though not fully in proportion to the rise in the price of wage-goods; and similarly in the case of a decreasing effective demand. In actual experience the wage-unit does not change continuously in terms of money in response to every small change in effective demand; but discontinuously. These points of discontinuity are determined by the psychology of the workers and by the policies of employers and trade unions. &#8230; These points, where a further increase in effective demand in terms of money is liable to cause a discontinuous rise in the wage-unit &#8230; have &#8230;  a good deal of historical importance. But they do not readily lend themselves to theoretical generalisations.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is, the response of wages to aggregate demand in the real world is not smooth, simple or amenable to mathematical formalization.  In other words, don&#8217;t put a Phillips curve into your models.</p>
<p>Just to confirm Mike&#8217;s recollection, I will deal with a much more boring passage which uses strange notation invented by Keynes.  Other readers might want to quit hire.</p>
<p>As Mike Kimel recalled, Keynes also noted that the Phillips curve becomes vertical during a hyperinflation. Unfortunately he makes this point </p>
<p>Unfortunately it is expressed in terms of the obscure notation introduced in the first section of <a href="http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/keynes/general-theory/ch20.htm">&#8220;Chapter 20. The Employment Function&#8221;</a> whose one redeeming feature is footnote 1. &#8220;Those who (rightly) dislike algebra will lose little by omitting the first section of this chapter.&#8221;  </p>
<p>The second half of chapter 20 isn&#8217;t all that much better, although it does include a presentation of the Lucas supply function, which is really the Keynes/Muth/Lucas supply function, for the case of clearning labor markets</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) For a time at least, rising prices may delude entrepreneurs into increasing employment beyond the level which maximises their individual profits measured in terms of the product. For they are so accustomed to regard rising sale-proceeds in terms of money as a signal for expanding production, that they may continue to do so when this policy has in fact ceased to be to their best advantage; i.e. they may underestimate their marginal user cost in the new price environment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is some boring notation from  chapters 20 and 21.</p>
<p>e is the elasticity of prices with respect to the money supply.</p>
<p>e_d is the elasticity of money times velocity with respect to money.</p>
<p>e_w   =  (DdW )/(WdD) = the elasticity of nominal wages with respect to aggregate demand which equals MV.</p>
<p>we call money wages &#8220;nominal wages.&#8221;  In other words e_w (which isn&#8217;t necessarily constant) is the elasticity of the Phillips curve expressed in terms of employment not unemployment.</p>
<p>&#8220;the case of a &#8216;flight from the currency&#8217; in which e_d and e_w become large, e is, as a rule, less than unity.&#8221;</p>
<p>We call &#8216;flight from the currency&#8217; hyper-inflation.  Keynes is noting that money becomes neutral during hyperinflations.  This, as noted by Thomas Sargent in &#8220;The End of Four Big Inflations&#8221; which was published some time after &#8220;The General Theory &#8230;&#8221; proves that the Phillips curve is not an economic law.  The obscure quote confirms Mike Kimel&#8217;s vague recollection.</p>

                                <p><em><strong>Update:</strong> one of our readers caught a mistake in the chart. I indexed the data to December 2008, or one year after the recession actually started in December 2007. The statistics that changed are formatted in bold, and the chart in the article has been updated. The analysis doesn&#8217;t change at all, but the number of jobs lost during the recession is higher than those indicated in the original article.</em></p>
<p>From the NY Times, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/03/business/economy/03skills.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">White House Plans Job Training Partnership</a> (bold by me):</p>
<blockquote><p>As part of efforts to address record-high levels of long-term unemployment, President Obama plans to announce a new national public-private partnership on Monday to help retrain workers for jobs that are in demand.</p>
<p>The national program is a response to frustrations from both workers and employers who complain that public retraining programs frequently do not provide students with employable skills. This new initiative is intended to help better align community college curriculums with the demands of local companies.</p>
<p>“The goal is to encourage community colleges and other training providers to work in close partnership with employers, to design a curriculum where they want to hire the people coming out of these programs right away,” said Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the President’s Council of Economic Advisers.</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House has coined this program Skills for America&#8217;s Future. The complication is, that lack of skills is not the problem for the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm">66% of the labor force aged 25 years and over</a> without a bachelor&#8217;s degree. The problem is the lack of jobs.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TKt9m3RKDII/AAAAAAAADRs/Hbyx6QcC17g/s400/education_chart.PNG" border="0"><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TKmk-0MvpkI/AAAAAAAADRc/uR6qmoZXus0/s1600/employment_chart.png"></a>The chart illustrates the dynamics of employment by level of education through August 2010, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t04.htm">as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</a> Note that the data are indexed to the onset of the recession, December <strong>2007</strong>, where 100 implies that employment is now at its pre-recession level.</p>
<p>The only category to recover employment in full is that requiring a Bachelor&#8217;s degree or higher. Furthermore, no material change in employment for BA&#8217;s (or higher) has occurred since about a year ago, as indexed employment hovers around 100. No new jobs.</p>
<p>The levels of employment for those workers with the lowest levels of educational attainment, 1. and 2., are <strong>10.2% </strong>and <strong>6.6%</strong> below pre-recession levels, respectively. That is <strong>over 3.5</strong> million jobs.</p>
<p>The White House program is targeted at community college students, or education category 3., some college or associate degree in the chart above. Employment for workers with a community college degree sits over <strong>3.2%</strong> below pre-recession levels, <strong>or 1.1 </strong>million jobs. Retraining workers will not raise the employment level further.</p>
<p>The government needs to &#8220;add jobs&#8221;, not &#8220;retrain workers&#8221;, and stimulate domestic aggregate demand.</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/09/letting-rates-go-up-for-the-rich.html" target="_blank"><strong>Letting rates go up for the rich</strong></a></p>
<p>When I was asked by the New York Times to write a brief op-ed to counter arguments made in the Washington Post that the economy would be helped by cutting taxes for the rich (so that they stay the same as they were under the Bush temporary provision), I jumped at the chance. See <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/09/extending-the-tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy-the-discussion-continues.html" target="_blank">Extending the Tax Cuts for the Wealthy</a>&#8211;the discussion continues (ataxingmatter, with link to the New York Times Open Forum). It seems quite clear that the &#8220;trickle-down&#8221; theory that assumes that if you help the rich, the world will be better off for all the rest of us has been clearly proven wrong by the four decades that it has held sway over economic, tax and social policy in the United States, starting with the presidency of Ronald Reagan. We have not had the stellar growth in jobs and opportunities for the middle class workers that the &#8220;reaganomics revolution&#8221; promised for good reason&#8211;those policies simply give more to big business and the rich, and do nothing to assure that any growth that does occur is shared with the vast majority of ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>Some of the comments to that post were from people who made more than $250,000 a year, complaining that they were not rich and why should their taxes increase. As I noted in a comment on the Times website, this is a common occurrence. We humans measure ourselves by those around us. If you make $300,000 a year, you probably know lots of other people who make about $300,000 a year and then a few who are clearly even better off than you are, making a half a million or a million or more a year. Certainly, many of the partners at the law firms in New York make a million or so a year, so that associates who made $200 thousand or so a year may have felt that they were &#8220;not rich&#8221; in comparison to the rich partners with whom they worked. But the fact is, anyone making that much is in the very privileged set&#8211;just not necessarily in the absolutely most privileged set. Being privileged to decide whether to buy private horsebacking riding lessons in Manhattan or whether to have a private in-ground pool in your back yard or whether to send your children to one of the ritziest colleges in the northeast is to be rich. For those with average incomes, sending their children to any college at all is often an impossible dream, and all those &#8220;extras&#8221; that the well-to-do think of as &#8220;must haves&#8221; are pipedreams.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The New York Times article on the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/30/business/30rich.html?_r=1&#038;emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y" target="_blank">Definition of Rich Now A Tax Issue</a>, New York Times (Sept. 30, 2010) spends a lot of time before it gets to that key point. Sure, some families that make more than $250,000 may think they identify more with people who make less than with multimillionaires. But odds are they haven&#8217;t really ever focused on what life is like for the majority of Americans who make less than half what they do. As Brad DeLong says in the article, those in the top 5% are comparing themselves to those in the top 2% rather than looking down at multitudes with less assets than they have. To quote DeLong:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is pathetic and embarrassing that somebody with five times the median household income, someone in the top 2 or 3 percent of the population, thinks of himself as just another &#8216;average Joe.&#8217; Why don&#8217;t you ask someone who makes $40,000 or $50,000 a year if they have a lot in common with a family making $250,000.</p></blockquote>

<p>In Response to Bryan Caplan et. al., Part 1  &#8211; An Empirical Look at the US Economy From the Perspective of Economic Schools of Thought</p>
<p>One charge that often comes up from libertarian and conservative economists is that there is no data to support the positions typically adopted by those can be said to subscribe, at least in broad strokes, to the general outline of the economy as described by Keynes.   As an example, Bryan Caplan wrote <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/10/the_keynesian_a.html#comments">this</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Keynesians have been a smug bunch from their earliest days.  Here&#8217;s how Keynes once replied to Hayek:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus those who are sufficiently steeped in the old point of view simply cannot bring themselves to believe that I am asking them to step into a new pair of trousers, and will insist on regarding it as nothing but an embroidered version of the old pair which they have been wearing for years.</p></blockquote>
<p>But what is the source of Keynesians&#8217; self-confidence?  Every Keynesian I&#8217;ve ever known has a stock answer: <ital>The empirics are on our side.</ital>  But when probed, they rarely deliver any details about these empirics.  It&#8217;s been three decades since Keynesians could merely point at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillips_curve">Phillips Curve</a> and say, &#8220;See?  See?!&#8221;  And in terms of merely &#8220;fitting the data points,&#8221; Prescott infamously showed that a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_business_cycle_theory">simple RBC model works rather well.</a></p></blockquote>
<p>At risk of getting sidetracked, a couple notes about the Phillips Curve and the RBC model.  The Phillips Curve, purportedly showing a trade-off between the inflation rate (of wages, at least) and unemployment was an erroneous idea glommed onto by many Keynesians because it provided an easy-to-explain way for government actions to improve the economy (i.e., when unemployment rose too much, the government could spend some money to push it down, but not too much less it spur inflation). </p>
<p>While its been a long time since I read Keynes, I don&#8217;t think he mentioned anything of this sort, being familiar with the German post-World War I experience and all that.  To say that the Phillips curve was is integral to Keynesian views because some prominent Keynesians used it as an excuse is to say that invading Iraq and cutting taxes are a part of the Southern Baptist theology.  As to the RBC model working rather well &#8211; it may be adequate for spotting things in the rearview mirror as they go by, but if it isn&#8217;t too deus ex machina to actually serve some purpose (say, anticipating events), someone please tell me what that might be.  </p>
<p>Given so many people, many of them thoroughly incompetent, built (to use the term loosely, in many instances) on the work that Keynes did, criticizing Keynes for the opinions of some of his lesser disciples makes as much sense as criticizing Hayek because of something that Glenn Beck said in last night&#8217;s broadcast. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />The basic Keynesian insight, and about the only thing that all the various flavors of Keynesian &#8220;thought&#8221; agree on, is that when the economy is in a recession, government spending can be tremendously helpful.  (By contrast, most libertarians and conservative economists are against most government spending, even during periods of economic weakness.)  Now, if you look at every recession since 1929, the first year for which there&#8217;s data from the National Income and Product Accounts tables, there aren&#8217;t many instances where the government cut spending during or just after a recession, but those instances have led to shorter, slower expansions, which can be summarized in this graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCnnVNeRI/AAAAAAAAAbI/7GLgMs272dI/s1600/keynes1.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCnnVNeRI/AAAAAAAAAbI/7GLgMs272dI/s320/keynes1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>Notice that when it comes to overall growth during an economic expansion (i.e., length of expansion * speed of expansion), cutting spending produced worse outcomes than small increases in government spending, and large increases in government spending produced better results still.  (More info and a link to data sources <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=15">here</a>.)  That fits very well with Keynesian theory of all stripes.  On the other hand, it doesn&#8217;t fit with libertarian, Austrian, or conservative economic theory.</p>
<p>Another thing about Figure 1&#8230;  had you shown that graph to Keynes in the early 30s, he&#8217;d have had no trouble believing it.  Had you showed it to Hayek, be it in the Road to Serfdom era, or decades later, he wouldn&#8217;t have.  My bet is that most folks on Caplan&#8217;s side of the fence don&#8217;t that&#8217;s what happened, and have been happily theorizing based on a reality a 180 degrees different from what Figure 1 shows for a long, long time.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s flip things a bit, and look at the most basic tenet of libertarian/conservative economic thought, namely that because of the profit motive, the private sector is relatively efficient compared to the public sector.  Note that a number of people who call themselves Keynesians believe this as well, at least under certain circumstances that have been observed in the not unrecent past.  An implication of this belief is that, all else being equal, jurisdictions that tax less will produce faster economic growth over a relatively long period of time.</p>
<p>I tested that not long ago, using data on the growth of real per capita income and the tax burden (from libertarian favorite, the Tax Foundation) for the fifty states plus the District of Columbia.   At times, some states are raising tax burdens, and others are lowering them &#8211; conservatives/libertarians would expect the former states to grow slower than the latter.   At other times, almost all states are lowering tax burdens, and in this case, conservatives/libertarians would expect the states that lowered tax burdens the most to produce the fastest growth rates.  Finally, in those periods where most states are raising the tax burdens on their citizens, conservatives/libertarians would expect the most from those states that raised their tax burdens by the least.  </p>
<p>Now, for every two year increment between 1977 and 2002, states were broken up into three equal sized-groups:  relatively high tax burden states, relatively low tax burden states, and medium burden states.  Growth rates were measured for each state for the subsequent six years, thus creating a series of rolling 8 year windows made up of a tax decision in years 1 and 2 and a growth rate in years 3 through 8.  (The eight year window was selected because most successful governors seem to serve two four year terms.)  Here is what the data shows:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCnwWh3PI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/BaYhf3cfKf0/s1600/keynes2.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCnwWh3PI/AAAAAAAAAbQ/BaYhf3cfKf0/s320/keynes2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>As I noted at the time:</p>
<blockquote><p>The table is interpreted as follows: the smallest tax cutters (i.e., those who cut taxes the least or raised them the most in any given year) produced the fastest economic growth about 42% of the time, second about 29% of the time, and third 29% of the time. By contrast, the middle group came in first in one third of all occasions. The &#8220;tax cuttingest&#8221; group came in first place a mere quarter of the time; in half of all years, it came in last place.</p>
<p>Many conclusions are reasonable from this. However, concluding that states that cut taxes have produced the fastest growth rate in per capita income is not one of them. </p></blockquote>
<p>(The full post, including links to the data sources <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?s=state+and+local&#038;x=0&#038;y=0">here</a>.)</p>
<p>We find something similar at the Federal level.  The following graph shows the growth rate in real GDP per capita for each President from 1929 (again, the first year for which data is available from the NIPA tables) to the present, color coded according to whether they increased or decreased tax burdens.  </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCn5iO-OI/AAAAAAAAAbY/bSco3lIT2Lg/s1600/keynes3.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TKkCn5iO-OI/AAAAAAAAAbY/bSco3lIT2Lg/s320/keynes3.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3</p>
<p>Clearly this is not the truth that you&#8217;ll hear from many on the conservative/libertarian side of the aisle.  Note that FDR is only shown until 1938 to sidestep the usual arguments from folks on the right who seem to believe that he did nothing right until World War 2; 1938 is sufficiently ahead of WW2 (i.e., even before lend-lease) that his performance cannot be influenced by WW2.  </p>
<p>(More info on that graph, plus data sources <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=50">here</a>.  Note that I also have an entire book reaching similar conclusions.  More info and a free download of chapter one <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">here</a>.)  </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m just warming up, but this post is getting long, so I&#8217;ll save my best material for Part 2.  But this is enough to say, for now, that the basic assumption that underlies Keynesian thought is supported by the available data.  The basic assumption that underlies both conservative and libertarian economics is completely contradicted by simple graphs of the data.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m having my first ever book signing on Sunday, October 10, at the Border&#8217;s bookstore in North Canton, Ohio for <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">Presimetrics</a>, the book I wrote with Michael Kanell.  If it goes well, I&#8217;ll look into doing signings at bigger cities as well.  As to the selection of the store &#8211; simply put, they were the first to ask!  A very enthusiastic friend of mine (thanks Marie!!!) ordered a few copies of the book for herself and a few other people, and while she was there to pick them up, she proudly (did I say she was enthusiastic about the book?) mentioned she knew the author.  </p>
<p>The rest, as they say, is history, or at least next Sunday early afternoon.  </p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Mark Thoma linked to <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2010/10/scott-sumner-on-what-keynes-wrote-about.html">a post at my personal blog </a>about the history of economic thought 101, what did Keynes write in &#8220;The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money.&#8221;  So I guess my next effort at humiliatingly elementary history of thought should be here.  After the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>When contemporary economists speak of &#8220;involuntary unemployment&#8221; we mean that there are three agents, a worker, an unemployed person and an employer, that the unemployed person would be glad to work for a wage lower (perhaps slightly lower) than the one paid to the worker and the employer would be glad to employ the unemployed person at that lower wage (perhaps laying of the worker).  With this definition, involuntary unemployment can occur because labor unions force employers to pay a high wage even if there are people who would accept a lower wage.  This case is an example of the &#8220;Insider/outsider&#8221; model of involuntary unemployment.</p>
<p>Keynes meant something else. He would have called that unemployment voluntary because &#8220;labour as a whole&#8221; or the workers or the working class were unwilling to supply labour at a lower wage.  Not being Scott Sumner and not being willing to accuse Paul Krugman of intellectual dishonesty under the assumption that the links he puts in his posts ar purely decorative, I shall click <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keynes/john_maynard/k44g/chapter2.html">Krugman&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keynes/john_maynard/k44g/chapter2.html">link</a>.</p>
<p>Here Keynes is explaining what he calls &#8220;the classical theory.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>the fact that the population generally is seldom doing as much work as it would like to do on the basis of the current wage? For, admittedly, more labour would, as a rule, be forthcoming at the existing money-wage if it were demanded. The classical school reconcile this phenomenon with their second postulate by arguing that, while the demand for labour at the existing money-wage may be satisfied before everyone willing to work at this wage is employed, this situation is due to an open or tacit agreement amongst workers not to work for less, and that if <strong>labour as a whole</strong> would agree to a reduction of money-wages more employment would be forthcoming. If this is the case, such unemployment, though apparently involuntary, is not strictly so, and ought to be included under the above category of &#8216;voluntary&#8217; unemployment due to the effects of collective bargaining, etc.</p></blockquote>
<p>So to Keynes unemployment due to nominal wage rigidity and unemployment due to collective bargaining were &#8216;voluntary&#8217; unemployment.  The quotes are not scare quotes.  He is quoting other economists (principally Pigou) and he uses the word with that sense throughout The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money.</p>
<p>This means that self declared &#8220;New Keynesians&#8221; would be called &#8220;classicals&#8221; by Keynes.  </p>
<p>Keynes argued that there can be cases in which &#8220;labour as a whole&#8221; can&#8217;t obtain more employment by agreeing to a reduction of money-wages (what we call nominal wages). Basically he argues (assumes really) that firms will cut prices if workers accept lower wages (he definitely assumed flexible prices and basically pretty much assumed perfect competition in product markets).  So the immediate effect of the lower nominal wage would be the same real wage and a lower price level. The effect of this is equivalent to the effect of an increase in the money supply.  The increase of the money supply won&#8217;t cause increased employment if the economy is in a liquidity trap.</p>
<p>So far Keynes has presented a general theory which really isn&#8217;t all that much more general.  He would just say that the arguments which he called classical require the qualifier &#8220;so long as the economy isn&#8217;t in a liquidity trap, that is so long as safe short term interest rates aren&#8217;t essentially zero&#8221; and then consider the other case.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the end of the story.  For one thing, if a small open economy is on the gold standard, the money supply can automatically shrink when the price level falls so the real money supply stays the same (oddly exactly this point was very much stressed by Sumner once).  For another, even without a gold standard a central bank which targets nominal interest rates will respond to the reduction of the price level by reducing the money supply. This can imply that downward wage flexibility causes reduced employment as it causes deflation which means that the constant nominal interest rate corresponds to a higher real interest rate and lower investment for given GDP growth.</p>
<p>However, it shows reckless disregard for the truth to claim that what Keynes wrote about the classicals was dishonest, because those classicals were essentially New Keynesians.  It is equally reckless <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=7279">to say</a> that what Krugman wrote &#8220;the other side in this debate generally adheres, more or less, to something like what Keynes called the “<a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keynes/john_maynard/k44g/chapter2.html">classical theory</a>” of employment, in which employment and output are basically determined by the supply side. &#8221; is dishonest.  </p>
<p>He specified that he meant <strong>what Keynes called </strong>&#8220;the classical theory&#8221; making it clear to anyone with normal linguistic skills (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gricean_maxims">including Gricean maxims</a>) that other people use the phrase with another meaning.  And that  and gave a link which no one could be expected to actually click since Krugman has only occasionally stressed that the links are not decorative (indeed maybe only <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/click-the-links/">once</a>).</p>
<p>Now everyone is sloppy sometimes.  But Sumner was reckless and sloppy when accusing others of intellectual integrity and has earned some quiet time.</p>

<p>“This summer, executives from the New York-based private equity firm SK Capital traveled to Houston to celebrate the first anniversary of their acquisition of a nylon manufacturing business. Soon they will have a bigger reason to uncork the Champagne. The nylon manufacturer has announced plans to issue about $1 billion in debt, of which $922 million will be used to pay a dividend to SK. For SK, which paid $50 million in cash for the business, that is an astonishing almost 18-fold return in a little more than a year.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The entire blogsphere seems to be fascinated by the idea that maybe the IRS could mail tax payers a receipt showing where their taxes go.  Oddly the IRS just decided to stop mailing something &#8212; 1040 booklets.  Which, you guessed it, explain where your tax money goes. </p>
<p>This has been mailed to every household every year for decades.  So why are tax receipts a new idea ?</p>

<p>Now it&#8217;s not perfect.  The IRS doesn&#8217;t like tiny slices so they put medicaid and welfare together as &#8220;social programs&#8221; (welfare might mean tanf plus food stamps plus suplementary security income) and put foreign aid in with defence.  People would have to read the footnotes.  An actual policy is never as pleasing to people as one they can design but it can be as good as the one which will come out of the sausage factory.</p>
<p>I am old enough to have filled out tax forms on paper.  Nothing encourages casual skimming and looking at the illustrations more. I  have spent much time staring at these pie charts while trying to force myself to look through my &#8220;records.&#8221;</p>
<p>No one seems to know about the pie charts <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040.pdf">(which are still there in the 1040 instructions on page 101 (warning huge boring pdf)).</a></p>
<p>Like Tim Geithner (see page 170) I am tempted to blame turbotax.</p>
<p>A receipt in the mail will do no good.  The only solution is to require tax preparation programs to display the data and tax prepareration firms to show it to people before they sign the forms.  Of course forcing people to look at something really is illiberal.  Nothing less will force US taxpayers to learn where the money goes.  They don&#8217;t know, because they don&#8217;t want to know.</p>
