<blockquote><p>An administration official said that in the emerging deal, the “Making Work Pay” credit would be replaced with a one-year reduction in payroll taxes for workers.</p>
<p>In addition to a <strong>two-year extension of the income tax rates </strong>enacted under President George W. Bush, the deal includes a <strong>one-year extension of jobless aid </strong>for the long-term unemployed. Officials said negotiators were also close to an agreement to <strong>restore the federal estate tax</strong>, which lapsed at the start of this year, with an exemption of up to $5 million per individual, and a maximum rate of 35 percent.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/f062badc-0169-11e0-9b29-00144feab49a.html#axzz17OMVXJsl" target="_blank">Financial Times</a> reports this news:</p>
<blockquote><p>The US Supreme Court is to decide whether the largest class action employment lawsuit in US history can proceed against Walmart, the discount retailer, in a case that is being closely watched by other large corporate employers.</p>
<p>Walmart appealed to the highest US court in the summer after a federal appeals court in California gave the go-ahead for a sex discrimination suit filed in 2001 that now covers an estimated 1.5m current and former women employees.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update: see the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/business/07bizcourt.html?_r=2&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=ikuta&#038;st=cse">NYT article</a> for Beverly&#8217;s note.  Correction to first paragraph (preventing).</p>
<p><strong>Beverly Mann</strong> sends a note on her thinking:</p>
<p>“In a second dissent, Judge Sandra S. Ikuta said that allowing the case to go forward as a class action would prevent Wal-Mart from presenting tailored defenses to individual claims,” the Times article says. If the Supreme Court agrees with this, it would eliminate virtually all class actions, on the basis that, by its very nature, the use of the class action procedure would violate the constitutional right to due process of law by preventing tailored defenses to individual claims.</p>
<p>One of the pro-business right’s obsessions is class actions; they’ve been out to end the availability of the class-action procedure for decades now. I think it’s highly likely that the Supreme Court will use this case to significantly limit the availability of the class-action procedure, but probably not by saying that class actions violate the constitutional right to due process of law by presenting tailored defenses to individual claims; they probably will have four but not five votes for that. More likely, they’ll say that classes of plaintiffs have to be more narrowly drawn, but not so narrowly that there can only be classes comprised of plaintiffs identically situated in all respects.</p>
<p>According to the article, Judge Kozinski complained that “Maybe there’d be no difference between 500 employees and 500,000 employees if they all had similar jobs, worked at the same half-billion square foot store and were supervised by the same managers. But the half-million members of the majority’s approved class held a multitude of jobs, at different levels of Wal-Mart’s hierarchy, for variable lengths of time, in 3,400 stores, sprinkled across 50 states, with a kaleidoscope of supervisors (male and female).”</p>
<p>But if the company itself had a de facto policy of discriminating against women in wages and promotions, or if large segments of the company did, then that should be sufficient to establish a class for purposes of a lawsuit. But here’s betting that when this case is decided, it won’t be.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care: Really, Really Bad Idea(?)<br /></strong><br />The Food and Drug Administration has approved a proposal to liberalize the guidelines for lap band weight loss surgery (much to the delight of the company making lap bans).</p>
<p>Previous guidelines required a very high level of severe obesity OR  severe obesity combined with hypertension or diabetes or etc.</p>
<p>New guidelines will likely double the number of persons qualifying for the surgery. (If i had high blood pressure I would qualify, and I&#8217;m not that fluffy).</p>
<p>POLITICAL INCORRECTNESS ALERT:</p>
<p>Physicians are supposed to screen such candidates after exercise and diet have failed, or proceed when collateral medical conditions are very serious, this will potentially cause of rush of surgeries by patients who would be better off with fork control and more exercise. Many health providers think so, but aren&#8217;t likely to say so loudly in public.</p>
<p>The surgery does have side effects, and every surgery has infections risks.</p>
<p>And there is a significant cost for each surgery. There is no cost in driving past Krispy Creme.</p>

<p><strong>Ireland &#8211; The Questions Nobody Seems to be Asking</strong><br />Cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">the Presimetrics</a> blog.</p>
<p>Talk about deja vu all over again.  Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2010/12/a-simple-public-choice-theory-of-the-ireland-crisis.html">Tyler Cowen</a> talking about the Ireland bailout, and linking to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2010/12/letter-from-ireland/67393/">Megan McArdle</a> discussing the same.  Its deja vu, for me, because it seems just about everyone commenting on the issue is ignoring what should be an obvious point, namely that a bail-out is at best a possible solution to the wrong problem.  Interestingly enough, this wrong problem has been around for a very long time, and the same cast of characters have been busily ignoring it (or even praising it) for a very long time.  </p>
<p>I said this is deja vu all over again for me, because the last time I gave much thought to the issue (back in 2006), I wrote a post that linked to both Tyler Cowen and Megan McArdle (then Jane Galt).  I&#8217;d like to quote myself extensively if I may:</p>
<blockquote><p>There seems to be <a href="http://www.janegalt.net/archives/009425.html">some</a> <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2006/08/the_youth_depen.html">discussion</a> about why Ireland is growing as quickly as it is.</p>
<p>I am completely ignorant about this, and haven’t even been to Ireland. But I do have a question… Is it possible that part, even a large part, of the Irish boom, is fictional?</p>
<p>By fictional, I don’t mean lacking in physical manifestations such as massive improvements in infrastructure, etc. Consider the effects of something else I’m mostly ignorant about, namely the Menem-and-Cavallo-dollarize-privatize-and-steal plan (as I recall it had a different name, but to me this one captures its essence a little better) in Argentina. For a number of years after it was launched, it looked like Argentina was doing really well. There was all kinds of new investment in infrastructure, the mood in Argentina was upbeat, and many economists (especially the conservative ones) and financial publications such as the Wall Street Journal were breathlessly pointing to Argentina as a country that other developing nations should imitate.</p>
<p>The problem in Argentina was that much of the funding for the short-term but much-hyped prosperity that followed came from the proceeds of the sale of government-owned assets (airline, railroads, etc.), or rather, the portion of the proceeds of the sale of government-owned assets that wasn’t stolen outright. Instead of assuming the proceeds from those sales were a one-time windfall, the Argentine government, foreign economists and the Wall Street Journal acted as if they were recurring sources of funding, leading gullible foreign investors to come running with their money. With so many experts patting them on the back, eventually even the skeptical Argentine public came to believe Argentina had miraculously fixed all its problems. When the windfall ended, the dwindling foreign reserves were not enough to maintain the dollar peg for long, and the whole house of cards came down.</p>
<p>Now… some of the growth in Argentina was real, and both dollarization and privatization may well have created more amenable economic conditions. But not enough to justify all the enthusiasm, or to ignore the very real problems the plan also brought.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So… where does that leave Ireland? Well, the worst year of my life was spent at a Big X (at the time, X was equal to 6) accounting firm, doing transfer pricing. Transfer pricing often amounts to little more than highballing the amount of a company’s activity taking place in low tax jurisdictions and lowballing the amount that takes place in a high tax jurisdiction in order to reduce one&#8217;s overall tax burden. It is often done creatively. Say company X transfers ownership of a logo to the subsidiary of company X in the Caymans. Then, every time company X sells a tennis shoe with that logo, it pays a royalty to its subsidiary in the Caymans. If taxes in the Caymans are lower in the US, X hires E&#038;Y or PWC or whoever to argue that most of the value in the shoe sits in the logo (and therefore is income received by the Cayman subsidiary and thus taxable in the Caymans), and not in the shoe itself (which is income received by the parent company and taxable in the US).</p>
<p>So back to Ireland…. Say you’re a pharmaceutical company. You have hundreds of highly paid researchers scattered throughout the globe – in places like the US, Switzerland, Germany, etc. Because taxes are lower in Ireland than in the rest of these locations, when a blockbuster drug is discovered, it is advantageous to play up the contribution of the researchers in Ireland and play down the part of the researchers made elsewhere.</p>
<p>This has at least two obvious effects. The first is the direct artificial boost to Irish GDP (and an artificial reduction elsewhere). Since Ireland is relatively small, if a crumb is taken from the US, another crumb is taken from Switzerland, etc., the effect can be very large in Ireland. The second effect is indirect – in order to pull this stunt off, it is necessary to have at least some facilities in Ireland, leading to more hiring and building in Ireland as more companies get more heavily invested in playing the game. But its in nobody’s interest to say this is being as a tax dodge, so a mythology springs up (as it did in Argentina), and part of that mythology, at least, is self-sustaining.</p>
<p>I would imagine the situation is not quite as artificial as in Argentina – Ireland does have a young, fairly educated population, and a convenient location, whereas the change from hyperinflation to rapid growth in Argentina truly looked like a miracle to those who didn’t look too closely (i.e., almost everyone). The Irish miracle has gone on for at least two decades, and there may well be enough of a solid underpinning for it to continue indefinitely. But, I have no idea how much of the Irish growth is due to these effects, nor a clue how to measure them. Any ideas? Any other thoughts as to why Ireland is growing so rapidly?</p></blockquote>
<p>(Note &#8211; transfer pricing was a favorite topic of the early posters on Angry Bear &#8211; Angry Bear, Kash, and PGL all had a number of excellent posts on Transfer Pricing that predated mine.)</p>
<p>About six months after that post, I noted some, er, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/02/riedls-myth-8-part-b.html">corroborating evidence</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/69xx/doc6905/11-30-Cross-BorderInvestment.pdf">CBO</a> 20% of the returns on investment abroad by US companies from 1993 – 2003 came from Ireland and Bermuda. Ireland and Bermuda. If there’s some way to explain that 20% of the returns of all American companies abroad came from Ireland and Bermuda without invoking tax fraud on a massive scale, I’d love to hear it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, none of this is intended to suggest that the Irish government wasn&#8217;t amazingly stupid in agreeing to take on the debts of private banks.  (Hey, the administrations of both GW and Obama did the same amazingly stupid thing, but they disguised it a bit better, and the ability to print dollars buys the US some leeway to deal with it.)  However, it does raise important issues:</p>
<p>1.  How much of the Irish growth was fictitious?</p>
<p>2.  What is the expected rate at which fictitious growth is transformed into real growth?  Presumably that rate exceeds zero (if companies set up so much as a pass-through in Ireland to reduce their tax rate, some of the money will stick to Ireland), but presumably it is well less than 100% (if you&#8217;re attributing a technology developed by 23 engineers in San Jose, CA and 14 in Frankfurt to a single technician in Dublin, you might reduce your tax rate but the knowledge base still won&#8217;t be in Dublin.)  I imagine that, paradoxically, the more the American and German tax authorities enforce compliance, the more they help the beggar-thy-neighbor types by essentially forcing their companies to do something real in those jurisdictions.  Eventually, some of the engineering work actually does move to Ireland.</p>
<p>3.  Are the beggar-thy-neighbor countries (or states, natch) more susceptible to downturns than other countries?  After all, when the doo-doo hits the fan, and profits are down, Siemens and Intel and the rest of &#8217;em have less of an incentive to minimize profits in high tax jurisdictions, and more of an incentive to show losses in those same high tax jurisdictions.  Activities of any sort in Ireland becomes an afterthought.  Additionally, I imagine that the Irelands of this world are disproportionately dependent on financial transactions.</p>
<p>4.  How much of a hit do places like the US and Germany (or New York and California) take as a result of beggar-thy-neighbor policies?  What should these countries (and states) owe to their citizens or corporations that take advantage of the schemes made possible by the beggar-thy-neighbor policies? </p>
<p>5.  Is the stupidity of the Irish government (in taking on the debts and obligations of private banks) something that will have a long term deleterious effect on Ireland&#8217;s ability to continue playing beggar-thy-neighbor?   The collapse of the housing bubble is a separate matter altogether from the transfer-pricing-milking-operation the Irish government was running, but might it affect Ireland&#8217;s ability to keep playing the game?  (I don&#8217;t know enough about the Irish economy to hazard a guess right now, especially given the baby on my lap has just starting screaming since I started writing this sentence&#8230;  which I guess is a signal to end this post.)</p>

                                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-l-borosage/americas-confidence-defic_b_787987.html">Robert Borosage</a> writes a warning about when bipartisan elites come to a consensus on solving the &#8220;problem&#8221;.</p>
<blockquote><p>Today&#8217;s elite consensus &#8212; that deficits are at crisis levels, that budgets must be brought into balance immediately &#8212; is equally wrong-headed. It slights the real crisis we face, and is foreign to the spirit that made America great.</p>
<p>What is the crisis we face today? We have an economy scarred by mass unemployment, falling wages, and growing insecurity. In the downturn, a staggering 40 percent of American households have been afflicted by unemployment, negative home equity (&#8220;under water homes&#8221; worth less than their mortgages), mortgage payment arrears, or foreclosure. In November 2008, one quarter of Americans aged 50-59 reported that they&#8217;d lost more than 35 percent of their retirement savings.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But this devastation caused by the collapse of the financial bubble and resulting recession is but the foul expression of an economy that has suffered long-term decline. We were hemorrhaging manufacturing jobs when the economy was growing before the bubble burst. Wages fell for most Americans over the course of the last decade, which suffered the worst job creation of any period since the end of World War II. The imbalances were obscene before the recession, with finance capturing 40 percent of corporate profits, the wealthiest 1 percent capturing half of the benefits of economic growth, the US running soaring trade deficits, even in high technology products, with China and the world. Our decaying infrastructure, broken health care system, declining educational performance in relation to the industrial world all preceded the fall.</p>
<p>So if we now turn to balancing our budget and succeed, what then? We will have had a brutal fight that will turn us one against another without addressing the fundamental challenges facing the country. </p>
<p>The right question we need to ask, I would argue, is what is the new strategy, the new foundation for an economy that offers hope for rebuilding America&#8217;s economic vitality in the competitive global market place? This requires a clear and bold strategy for revitalizing American manufacturing. It requires investments in areas vital to our future &#8212; in modern infrastructure, in education and training, in research and innovation. We need to capture a lead in the green industrial revolution that is sweeping the world. It requires new trade strategy, shackles on financial speculation, empowering workers to capture a fair share of the productivity and profits they help generate to help rebuild America&#8217;s middle class. We have to figure out how to afford this, financing what we can, changing priorities and raising revenues where needed. But this is a far different question than just how we get our books in order.</p></blockquote>

Sources said Orszag might take a job in Citi&#8217;s I-banking division and an announcement could come as soon as today. Citigroup, which is still recovering from its $45B bailout, would be only the latest in a long string of companies that have poached workers from the political sector, and of employees who have bounced back and forth between regulating (directly or indirectly) financial firms and then working for them.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/40447573">States to face tighter finances.</a> States may have to make additional spending cuts over the next couple of years or else face the possibility of deteriorating financial health as tax revenues recover at a slow pace and support from the federal government dwindles. A new report from the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers warned of &#8220;extremely tight fiscal conditions for states,&#8221; and at least 23 states are already anticipating budget deficits totaling $40.5B in 2012.</p>

<blockquote><p>I think I should add some historical context here since the econ news on the problem with the PIIGS is focusing only on &#8220;the problem is they can&#8217;t depreciate there own currency and make everything better&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Ten years ago the PIIGS and others were desperate to get into the EU and use the Euro because they had depreciated the hell out of their currencies for decades and were unable to borrow money at reasonable rates anymore, if at all.  </p>
<p>The EU architects weren&#8217;t as stupid as our brilliant economists make them out to be. They imposed limits on fiscal and trade deficits on EU members. It is a well known fact that a stable currency is good for business, and the idea was to create a larger regional market with a single currency and more common regulations and import duties between members.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Where the problem came in is fiscal and trade deficits rules either weren&#8217;t enforced, or like Greece, some countries cooked the books and hid the problem. In the case of Iceland and Ireland, lack of banking regulation made them the safe haven for financial fraud, and this was exploited by some Euro and US banks as well as Irish banks.  </p>
<p>So the only good thing about having their own currency is the PIIGS would have gone bankrupt 10 years ago, and maybe would have partially recovered by now. But only maybe. (Some like to point to Argentina as a miracle economy, but really, how many are packing up to move there?)</p></blockquote>

<p>It might be worth reminding everbody about now that the Bush tax cuts were a poor idea even when they were first proposed.  Like so much else done by the Bush administration (and pushed by the right generally), they amounted to yet another means of redistributing from the have-less to the have-mores that Bush called his base.  The following is a good animation depicting the interrelationship of distributional issues and the tax cuts, showing visually how the riches from the last few decades went to the wealthy and then the tax cuts added to the problem by favoring them over ordinary folk.</p>
<p><em>&#8220;the Bush Tax Cuts&#8221; </em>(Oct 14, 2004)</p>
<p>
<p>One can only wish that those GOP voters in the Senate and House this week had gone back to reiew these points and then listen to their own guru, John McCain, who thought that the projected 2003 deficit of 246 billion (without tax cuts and war costs) was scandalously high.  He called &#8220;alarming&#8221; the 10-year deficit prediction for the cost of the Bush tax cuts of $1.8 trillion, especially when it didn&#8217;t even include the war costs, and that such a deficit could &#8220;lower the standard of income&#8221; for generations of Americans.  </p>
<p>That is, in 2003, even the crusty rightwinger John McCain recognized that at a time of deficits and significant war costs (back when he &#8220;hoped&#8221; that we would have a &#8220;brief, successful war in Iraq&#8221;), passing tax cuts of the magnitude proposed in 2003 (including the treatment of dividends for the wealthy elite at the preferential capital gains rate) would be irresponsible lack of statesmanship that disregarded the fiscal security of the American people.  He spent some time emphasizing the fact that the extent of war costs connected with the Bush invasion of Iraq were not knowable and could be quite high if the war &#8220;didn&#8217;t meet our best estimates for its duration&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, most Americans have suffered throughout the last decade from the irresponsibility of the Bush tax cuts that rewarded the wealthy and continued the &#8220;winner-take-all politics&#8221; noted by Joseph Hacker and Paul Pierson (in a book to be reviewed soon).</p>

                                <p>By <strong>Noni Mausa</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Opposite of Bankrupt</strong></p>
<p>Some time ago I wrote about dollars as bizarre IOUs, with no names,<br />dates or specific obligations.  They are free-floating promises, which<br />can be used to command the efforts of the other people who accept them<br />as valid.</p>
<p>I give you ten promises, and you give me a sack of potatoes.  The ten<br />promises I give you fragment to a fine dust and disperse backwards in<br />time to command the efforts of growers, shippers, plastic bag<br />producers, potato breeders, researchers, and a vast pyramid of all the<br />people whose efforts, minor or major, permit a sack of potatoes to sit<br />there waiting for me when I enter the store.</p>
<p>Where did my ten promises come from in the first place?<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Generally, I have them because I have spent time, exerted effort, and<br />focused my attention upon some task.  In return, I received<br />promise-tokens, which I can use to command the fractional efforts of<br />other people.  They may be near or far, known or unknown to me, in the<br />past or in the future, but these promises are nothing without their<br />ability to command the efforts of others and especially, to command<br />that effort anonymously.</p>
<p>Let’s look at bubbles and crashes with that in mind.</p>
<p>Trillions of promises evaporated practically overnight in the wake of<br />the 2008 real estate, stock market and investment collapses.  But real<br />wealth &#8212; in the form of homes, land, crops, buildings, human skills<br />and knowledge, and the myriad other desirable and necessary goods –<br />was practically untouched.  This created several important effects.</p>
<p>First, and inevitably, the real value of each surviving promise<br />ballooned – currency deflated drastically and almost instantaneously.</p>
<p>Huh?  Isn’t inflation still piddling along at one or two percent?  We<br />are warned about deflation and we have seen some, but not the steep<br />slither into the abyss that we saw in the 20s and 30s worldwide.</p>
<p>But the math is simple.  If 10% of your paper wealth suddenly<br />vanishes, deflation (fewer dollars for the same goods) must happen,<br />it’s a definitional truth.  But the key is that the dollar was<br />drastically inflated before the bubble, but the inflated bit was in<br />storage, not in circulation where it could inflate prices and require<br />wheelbarrows for trips to the grocery store.  It doesn’t matter if<br />Marty (“The Artist”) Billingham prints up thousands of hundred dollar<br />bills, if he then buries them or burns them.  These promises only<br />exist in circulation.</p>
<p>So, when the bubble popped, the potential value of each dollar<br />grew.  If this maneuver had been executed by the Fed, perhaps to<br />help the federal budget by having to mint fewer coins and bills,<br />nothing would have changed.  Pay would be less, prices would be less,<br />but proportionality would be preserved.</p>
<p>But no.  Proportionality went all to hell, because of whose promises<br />got liquidated.</p>
<p>The rising tide lifting boats is a lousy metaphor because all boats<br />sit on the top of the water, at the same level.  Imagine instead that<br />your wealth measures how far offshore you are.  When the tide rises,<br />all boats are lifted, but when it falls some are beached right away,<br />while others float serenely.  Even though the ocean liners technically<br />have 20 feet less water to float in, the difference is not important.</p>
<p>So when our currency deflated, whose hulls were stove in?</p>
<p>Well, we know that.  Property values stayed the same, insofar as value<br />means “a warm dry place that isn’t a cave,” but ownership skipped from<br />homeowners to the promise merchants, who can now command the efforts<br />of new buyers.  The equity in those homes is gone, whoever buys them<br />now has to start over and pay the cost-plus-interest from scratch.<br />Either the owners, or their heirs, take the hit for that tangle of<br />broken promises.</p>
<p>Pension plans took a big hit also. Wages and benefits, already<br />weakened, are still being hacked away at the roots.</p>
<p>In short, the effect of the bubble and crash was not to destroy<br />wealth, since all that wealth is still present or could be very<br />quickly rebuilt.</p>
<p>No, the real effect was to further shift the “ability to command the<br />fractional efforts of people” from the working majority to a<br />commanding minority.  And so long as money is accepted, so long as<br />currency can be used to command that effort anonymously, the majority<br />is in a pickle.</p>
<p>Bankruptcy is the loss of liquidity, the loss of abstract leverage to<br />command the efforts of other people.  Generally, this is a voluntary<br />process in which you confess you will never be able to provide<br />sufficient effort to compensate for the loans extended to you, and so<br />shed those obligations.  It pushes you off the rocks and, hopefully,<br />back into a few feet of water where you can begin again.</p>
<p>What do you call the opposite – the ownership of more IOUs than you<br />could have ever earned, which can be deployed anonymously, which<br />multiply over time, and which can be created out of thin air if you<br />know the magic words?  Who are you when you’re permanently anchored<br />over a Mariana Trench of money where no tide, however terrible, can<br />touch you?</p>
