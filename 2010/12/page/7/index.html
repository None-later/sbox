                                <p>By: Daniel Becker (DOLB)</p>
<p>On Countdown (12/9/10), Keith had on Thomas Buffenbarger, president of the International Machinist Union. It was a chance for an “I told you so moment”in that Mr. Buffenbarger noted while campaigning for Secretary Clinton that President Obama would not be a fighter. Go watch <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/ns/msnbc_tv-countdown_with_keith_olbermann/#40596879">the episode</a>.</p>
<p>I made<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/all-you-need-to-know-to-understand.html"> my position on of Obama</a> clear after the 60 Minutes interview. Mr. Buffenbarger&#8217;s comments only reinforces my position as to understanding President Obama as does Obama&#8217;s latest “negotiation”. Surprisingly, only 4 comments were made. Too bad, the nation would have been more prepared for this latest act in &#8220;Obama the Negotiator. Not!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, that is not what got me regarding Mr. Buffenbarger&#8217;s interview. No. It was that he confirmed something I have been thinking since Obama stated his compromise policy after this current midterm elections. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;when Bush put the tax cut&#8217;s in place, very few of the members I&#8217;m privileged to represent noticed any difference in their pay check. And so, if the tax cuts were to go away, and we go back to the tax rates of then, our members would see very little change in their tax rates again.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>Exactly. Has not the argument been that the cuts did little for the middle class? Then what is the problem with letting them go? I know for me it meant very little difference. Though, I realize having “meaning” is different for all so, here is a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/khtml/2005/06/05/national/20050605_HYPER_GRAPHIC.html?scp=2&#038;sq=%22class+matters%22&#038;st=m">very nice chart</a> I saved from 2005 looking at the tax cuts and what they meant for the various income groups.</div>
<div></div>
<div>First, let me say that when I initially viewed this chart years ago, I thought: How appropriate. Those who most likely think the republican party was watching out for them via tax cuts because they were in that top part of the food chain, were actually getting screwed too. Yeah, the one who you believes loves you is taking you for a ride. Those in the $100K to $300K range of income by 2015 were projected to pay a higher percentage of the share of national income taxes than they had before the cuts. And, even those above the $300k to the $1.5m range were getting much less of a break than their income relatives above them. Poetic justice? Just goes to show, that even those with significant incomes have no real conception of how small theirs is compared to the incomes of the upper echelons of this nation. But hey, you keep believing you&#8217;re just like them. It&#8217;s what they want. </div>
<p>More to the point of this post. Look at the “Average yearly tax savings” line for those from the lowest to the $383K level. I realize everyone&#8217;s situation is unique, but really, the range of the cost of the loss of the tax savings is virtually zero to 2.5% if your at $160K or 1% for those at $383k. As a share of supporting this nation, you/we have been screwed. I ask you all. The bottom 99%. Wouldn&#8217;t you like to really stick it to the economic royalty in this nation? Is 1% to 2.5% to much to give to finally get reality into the income tax?</p>
<p>You there in the 95 to 99% category. Your 2001 share of income was 15%.   Your projected share of the taxes in 2015 is 18.5% A ratio of 0.81. For your senior income family members the ratio in 2015 is 0.74. Still feeling loved? </p>
<p>Look at it this way. Based on this 2005 chart. The bottom 99% paid 75.3% of all income taxes before the tax cuts. Our projected share for 2015, the very tax cuts Obama et al have just negotiated to keep is 77.1%. </p>
<p>Who loves you now, baby?</p>
<p>Mr. Buffenbarger ended noting that his members understand that paying taxes is a privilege and is an act of support of our country. It is paying our way. So what do you say. Let&#8217;s show those at the very top just how unpatriotic they are. Let the tax cuts go and stand proud because honest American justice has prevailed.   You just screwed the biggest screwer of them all&#8230;The American Economic Royalty.</p>
<p>That is what the real Tea Party was about.</p>

<p><strong>Health Care: Reality is Ugly</strong></p>
<p>An Indiana baby with an extremely rare condition will not be receiving $500,000 experimental surgery at Duke because the State of Indiana cannot afford to pay the bill for the surgery.</p>
<p>The immediate howls of protest are directed at the Republican governor, but there are bigger issues here, and a comparative effectiveness program designed by Democrats could easily come to the same decision.</p>
<p>Stipulated, no one wants to see a baby die. No one. However&#8230;..</p>
<p>No system has infinite resources, and if the money was spent it would be care taken away from some other Indiana residents. Even if the economy were better.</p>
<p>On the other hand (as an economist might say) many common procedures were once experimental, that is how new surgeries and new cures are developed.</p>
<p>Fifty years ago this was easier, medicine was relatively primitive and babies died (including my infant cousins) because nothing could be done. Now, we have difficult, terrible decisions to make.</p>

<p>This <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ceres.org/Document.Doc?id=625">report by Ceres and Water Asset Management</a> (link repaired) shows that few participants in the<br />bond market—including investors, bond rating agencies, and the utilities themselves—<br />are accounting for growing water scarcity, legal conflicts and other threats in their<br />analyses. Some are even inadvertently encouraging risk by rewarding pricing and<br />infrastructure plans that encourage increased water use despite near-term supply<br />constraints. By overlooking these critical factors, all involved are allowing water risk to grow—and remain hidden—in the bond market.</p>
<p><a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2010/11/you-dont-miss-the-water-til-the-well-runs-dry.html" target="_blank">Obsidianwings</a> carries a post on water:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the Republicans celebrate their historical victories, the Democrats lick their wounds, the bankers count their bonus money, and the rest of us try to hold on to our jobs, homes, and retirement savings, some large US cities are facing a real challenge:</p>
<p>They&#8217;re running out of water. (see above link)</p>
<p>No water is a real problem.</p>
<p>And not just an &#8220;I can&#8217;t water my lawn&#8221; problem. A&#8221;my city can&#8217;t generate electricity&#8221;, or &#8220;these millions of acres can no longer be productive agricultural land&#8221; problem, or &#8220;it&#8217;s going to cost me five times as much for water next year&#8221; problem.</p>
<p>Or, a &#8220;this city can no longer support it&#8217;s population&#8221; problem.</p>
<p>This country and its economy has, to a great degree, been living off of infrastructure built years ago. Decades ago. It&#8217;s wearing out, being used up, being overwhelmed by the increasing demand being put on it. It will take effort, and costs money &#8211; a lot of money &#8211; to rebuild.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not seeing that happening. We have a reduced tax base because the FIRE sector blew the economy up, and because we&#8217;ve moved all of the non-tech middle class jobs offshore. It&#8217;s worth a Congressperson&#8217;s political life to suggest raising tax rates, on anyone, in any form, for any reason.</p></blockquote>

<p>Spending Remains Lower than Pre-Recession Levels State general fund spending is forecast to rise 5.3 percent in fiscal 2011 as 35 states enacted a fiscal 2011 budget  with general fund spending levels above those of fiscal 2010. However, declines of 7.3 percent and 3.8 percent in state general fund spending in fiscal 2010 and fiscal  2009 respectively mean that state general fund spending remains nearly $42 billion, or 6.2 percent below its fiscal 2008 level. The fiscal 2010 general fund spending decline of 7.3 percent is the largest decline in state spending in the history of this report. See chart below.</p>

<p>Additionally, in fiscal 2012 a significant amount of state funding made available by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 will no longer be available. The end of this support will result in a continuation of extremely tight fiscal conditions for states and could lead to further state spending cuts.</p>

<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/james-pethokoukis/2010/12/07/secret-gop-plan-push-states-to-declare-bankruptcy-and-smash-unions/" target="_blank">James Pethokoukis</a> with a hat tip to Naked Capitalism suggests this thought:</p>
<blockquote><p>Congressional Republicans appear to be quietly but methodically executing a plan that would a) avoid a federal bailout of spendthrift states and b) cripple public employee unions by pushing cash-strapped states such as California and Illinois to declare bankruptcy. This may be the biggest political battle in Washington, my Capitol Hill sources tell me, of 2011.</p>
<p>That’s why the most intriguing aspect of President Barack Obama’s tax deal with Republicans is what the compromise fails to include — a provision to continue the Build America Bonds program. BABs now account for more than 20 percent of new debt sold by states and local governments thanks to a federal rebate equal to 35 percent of interest costs on the bonds. The subsidy program ends on Dec. 31. And my Reuters colleagues report that a GOP congressional aide said Republicans “have a very firm line on BABS — we are not going to allow them to be included.”</p>
<p>In short, the lack of a BAB program would make it harder for states to borrow to cover a $140 billion budgetary shortfall next year, as estimated by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities.</p></blockquote>

<p>Dan Shaviro, a colleague at NYU, ends up being hopeful about the Obama-GOP deal.  See &#8220;The <a href="http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/2010/12/deal-on-extending-tax-c-uts.html">deal on extending the tax cuts</a>&#8220;, Start Making Sense, Dec. 6, 2010 and &#8220;<a href="http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/2010/12/tax-cut-deal-too-soon-to-tell-who.html">The tax cut deal: too soon to tell who really won?</a>&#8220;, Dec. 7, 2010.  I think that is because Dan tends to credit Economics 101 with considerably more wisdom than I do (and place &#8220;efficiency&#8221;, as defined by the free marketers, higher on the wish list for tax policy than I), so he thinks Social Security isn&#8217;t on a sound footing and that benefits will need to be cut; thinks expensing for corporations is a reasonable way to spur growth; thinks there is some possibility that the 2012 replay of &#8220;Bush tax cuts, take 2&#8221; might play out in favor of Obama if he is &#8220;very clear that he planned to veto any extensions and let all the tax cuts expire UNLESS the Republicans made the deal he requires&#8221;.  I&#8217;ll intersperse my comments with Dan&#8217;s below.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>1) extending all the expiring individual rate cuts for 2 years:</p>
<p>Dan says &#8220;we knew this was going to happen&#8221; so the only problem is that it comes up again in 2012 when Obama will &#8220;might face extra credibility problems&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think we only knew this was going to happen because Obama didn&#8217;t fight on this at all.  Obama signalled at the beginning that he would cave, and he did not take to the bully pulpit at all.  He conferenced with Republicans and cut out the Democratic leadership in reaching his &#8220;deal&#8221;&#8211;which is a Republican policy in everything but name.</p>
<p>2) extending unemployment insurance through 2011:</p>
<p>Dan says it is an important stimulus and &#8220;wasn&#8217;t going to happen otherwise.&#8221; </p>
<p>I agree on the stimulus.  But the Dems should have brought unemployment extension up on a daily basis and forced the Republicans to vote against it.  So the &#8220;wasn&#8217;t going to happen otherwise&#8221; is part of the give-up before you start negotiating that got us into this mess. </p>
<p>3) reduce the Social Security payroll tax by 2% for one year:</p>
<p>Dan says &#8220;good stimulus&#8221; though &#8220;targeting could have been a lot better&#8221; and admits my point (made when payroll holidays were first brought up) that the payroll holiday feeds into the drive to decimate Social Security by hitting the Trust Fund.  But Dan thinks the &#8220;concern&#8221; about long-term fiscal problems is real, and so is comfortable with addressing it &#8220;sooner&#8221; anyway.</p>
<p>I disagree. The concern about Social Security is being hyped in order to destroy Social Security as we know it.  It is in line with the enmity towards unions, towards single payer health care, towards re-regulation of the banks, towards breaking apart big banks, and towards any other policy that would restore a vibrant middle class.  By allowing a payroll holiday for everyone, the majority of the benefit goes to people who don&#8217;t really need it, and too little benefit goes to those who do.  Targeting is better than a tax cut purely for the rich, but that isn&#8217;t saying much.  Doing some stimulus in a means that pushes the GOP agenda to eviscerate Social Security forward is like tying one hand behind your back&#8211;a rather unwise way to enter a long-term battle for the economic future.  Will we have the brutal mix of casino and winner-take-all capitalism that has driven most of this country&#8217;s policies from Reagan on or will we have a tempered capitalism that ensures a broad-based growth and creates an economic system that works for everyone?  The Republican&#8217;s aims to let states go into bankruptcy and use that mechanism to destroy public employee unions says they are in this battle to destroy the New Deal if they can.  We need to fight just as hard on the side of the middle class.</p>
<p>4) Estate tax cut by increasing the exemption from the 2001 level to $5 million (basically 500% of the 2001 amount) and lowering the top rate to a mere 35%.</p>
<p>Dan thinks this might actually be preferable &#8220;in efficiency terms&#8221; to the current law, which would have restored 2001 rates in 2011, if done in a &#8220;distribution and revenue neutral framework&#8221;.  And even though this isn&#8217;t that, he doesn&#8217;t think a more progressive estate tax &#8220;is long-term feasible anyway.&#8221;  So this is not &#8220;a terrible outcome in a realistic overall sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here we part ways 100%.  There is no such thing as a distribution and revenue neutral framework&#8211;that is a fiction of economics 101 that permits what we have seen, which is four decades of redistribution upwards.  Further, distribution neutral is not desirable in an economy where the winners already take all&#8211;if we don&#8217;t reverse the direction of distribution in this economy, we will end up in oligarchy (if we aren&#8217;t there already).  In that context, this was the single most viable opportunity for reinstating an appropriate estate tax, either by letting the Republican-passed law take hold (return to 2001 exemption and rates) or by passing a slightly modified but ideally more progressive version (higher exemption but progressively higher rates beginning at 45%).  This is indeed &#8220;a terrible outcome in a realistic overall sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>5) extensions of the EITC, tuition tax credit and expensing (as well as the R&#038;D credit, not mentioned by Dan </p>
<p>Dan says that the EITC and tuition tax credit are okay because they may add progressivity and the expensing provision is okay as a short-term stimulus.</p>
<p>The EITC is okay.  Tuition tax credits just subsidize the things colleges spend money on that they don&#8217;t want students to have to feel they are paying for&#8211;like too high administrative salaries (across-the board, at private and public universities).   We ought to fund higher education at public institutions, but with conditions, such as limiting the percentage of total budget spent on administration or on the revenue sports, etc.  As for expensing, it is unclear how it can be stimulative in this context, when the reason companies aren&#8217;t expanding is because they don&#8217;t see a demand for the business.  Most companies have the cash on hand and can borrow at a funding cost that is extraordinarily low.  That isn&#8217;t what is holding back investment.  Odds are, the savings from expensing will just go to another round of higher manager salaries and big payouts to shareholders (who will also continue to benefit from an extraordinarily low dividend and capital gains rate under the deal).</p>
<p>Dan seems to think that Obama will be able to argue credibly that &#8220;this time I mean it&#8221; when it comes to the 2012 election and the Bush tax cuts are ready to expire once again.  Fat chance. There&#8217;s nothing so far to convince anyone&#8211;Obama caved before fighting on the public option and on taxes for the rich and on the estate tax and on capital gains and on carried interest and on and on.  Obama in fact is now pushing his Democratic colleagues to support an agenda that will easily get 100% Republican support and maybe enough reluctant Democratic support to pass, rather than rallying them to fight so that he can veto, if need be, wrong-headed legislation.  So he has proven that the Dems lose in the minority and they don&#8217;t bother to fight when they are in the majority.  No way his base will trust him to do it better next time around. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the GOP is already blaring that there is no way that they&#8217;ll give an inch on anything.  They won&#8217;t support the Build America Bond program, because they want states to declare bankruptcy as a means to destroy public employee unions.  And they don&#8217;t seem to care that they are destroying the American social contract between the wealthy and the rest of us at the same time&#8211;we are what we are because we have recognized the importance of a strong middle class that acts as a check on oligarchy.  Yet the Republican party&#8211;and now too many Dems&#8211;are willing to throw it all away just to get elected one more time (maybe) in the future.</p>
<p>In my view, the American people are the losers here.  The AMT patch primarily helps those with high incomes.  Most of those who pay the AMT because of bracket creep are in the 250-500,000 income range&#8211;certainly not middle class.   Only a few are in the 75-100,000 range.  The extension of extremely favorable taxation of secondary market capital gains and dividend income is of benefit to the wealthy who own most of the financial assets.  The extension of the tax rate cuts even below 250,000 already aids the wealthy&#8211;adding the tax rate cut at the top means that most of the rate cut goes to the very well off.  This is a very good deal with corporate managers and owners, and rotten for ordinary Americans. It&#8217;s the upside down world of George W. &#8220;the have-mores are my base&#8221; Bush.</p>

<p>Medicare rates for physicians have been, supposedly, regulated by the SGR* formula since 1998, but the formula is so wretched and lobbyists so strong the formula has been repeatedly postponed.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has been determined to do a one time catch up, which was scheduled to make an average cut of about 24% on December 1, 2010.</p>
<p>Congress has felt the heat from many different constituencies, but has been unable or unwilling to develop a new system.</p>
<p>The latest is the &#8221; “Physician Payment and Therapy Relief Act of 2010.”  Impressive title, but it is simply a one month reshuffling of some funds, a kick the can down the road   strategy that just delays the inevitable.</p>
<p>This is no way to make policy.</p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Changing Top Marginal Tax Rates</strong> &#8211; an op ed free to a good home<br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=253">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>I wrote most of what follows in the anticipation of trying to get it accepted as an op ed at a newspaper, but I guess the deal cut the other night means a bit of it needs rewriting&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>On January 1, 2011, the “Bush tax cuts” will expire and individual marginal tax rates, the percentage of income individuals pay in taxes to the federal government, will return to Clinton-era levels.  The political consensus seems to be that the tax cuts should be kept for most taxpayers, but there is disagreement about whether to let the highest marginal tax rate expire.  That rate applies to the portion of a high-income earner’s revenues that are in excess of some large amount &#8211; $250,000 and $1 million have been recently floated as thresholds.  But, aside from rhetoric about fairness peddled by both sides in the debate, what difference does it make to the economy whether the top marginal rate goes up or not?  A little history can help make it easier to understand what is at stake.  </p>
<p>When Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, the top marginal tax rate was 70%.  By 1988, the top marginal tax rate had been reduced to 28%. More importantly, Reagan changed the longstanding political landscape when it comes to taxation.  While the top marginal rate was never below 70% between 1936 and 1980, it has not gone above 39.6% in the years since Reagan left office.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But if Reagan’s philosophy prevailed, it is fair to ask:  have his tax policies generated the promised results?  Lower taxes were supposed to usher in an era of faster economic growth and increased prosperity.  However, while the economy did better under Reagan than it did under the three presidents who preceded him, Reagan-era growth could hardly be called impressive.  Real GDP (i.e., GDP adjusted for inflation) grew more slowly under Ronald Reagan than during the eight years presided by JFK and LBJ, and slower even than during any consecutive eight year period in which Franklin Delano Roosevelt was president.  FDR, it should be noted, raised the top marginal tax rate four times, from 63% to 94%.  </p>
<p>But perhaps it is unfair to compare Reagan to big-government types like Lyndon Johnson or Roosevelt, as they served during very different eras.  Focusing instead on more recent periods, real GDP also grew faster under Bill Clinton, who raised taxes, than it did under Ronald Reagan.  In fact, from 1981 to the present, the period in which Reagan’s philosophies have reigned triumphant, the correlation between the top marginal tax rate and the annual growth in real GDP has been positive.  That is to say, higher top marginal tax rates have been associated with faster, not slower real economic growth.  Conversely, lower top marginal tax rates have coincided with less economic growth. </p>
<p>The positive relationship between the top marginal tax rate and the growth in real GDP is very nearly bullet-proof.  For instance, it extends all the way back to 1929, the first year for which the government computed GDP data.  Additionally, higher marginal tax rates are not only correlated with faster increases in real GDP from one year to the next, but also with increases in real GDP over the subsequent two, three, or four years.  This is as true going back to 1929 as it is for the period since Reagan became president.  In fact, since the Reagan Revolution took hold, similar relationships have existed between the top marginal rate and several other important variables, like real median income, real private investment, consumer sentiment, the value of the dollar relative to other major currencies, and the S&#038;P 500.  Lower tax rates in any given year are associated with slower growth rates for each of these variables, whether those growth rates are measured over periods of one, two, three or four years.  </p>
<p>On the flip-side, since 1981, unemployment rates have generally shrunk faster when tax rates were higher than when they were lower.  As with the other economic measures, this relationship holds whether one is measuring the change in unemployment over a single year, over two years, over three years or over four years.</p>
<p>None of this means that higher taxes cause better outcomes.  Still, it is clear that the supposed negative repercussions from higher taxes simply have not materialized, notwithstanding pronouncements from politicians, pundits and economists.  The reason is simple:  those who are both willing and able to engage in tax avoidance when subject to a 40% marginal rate are not likely to behave any differently when that rate changes to 50%, or 30% for that matter.  But at a slightly higher top marginal rate, the government does get more revenue, and in this way can finance more spending on things that benefit the economy, such as infrastructure, public health, scientific research, education, alleviating poverty and of course, IRS audits.  Thus, allowing the top marginal rate to rise from current rates (35%) to the level they were under Bill Clinton (39.6%) is unlikely to harm the economy, and may actually help.</p>

<p>As always, if anyone wants my spreadsheet, drop me a line at my first name (that would be &#8220;mike&#8221;) period my last name at gmail.com.  If anyone wants the op ed (changed to reflect whatever deal conditions are applicable at the time), ditto.  </p>
<p>And finally, one question &#8211; why didn&#8217;t I read any op eds like this in the newspapers in the last few weeks and months?</p>

<p>Well the answer is in the above figure, or actually answers because the post title actually hides multiple questions depending on your view of Social Security generally. This is going to get kind of long so I will take it below the fold right away.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There are actually three lines represented in the figure: scheduled benefits (top thin line), payable benefits (middle thick line), and income excluding interest (bottom thin line). A close examination shows that tax income exceeded scheduled benefits up until 2009, meaning Social Security was in surplus by anyone&#8217;s definition, that tax income dipped below scheduled benefits this year, but are projected to rise again to meet the schedule in 2012 only to go permanently below the schedule in 2017. But the figure also shows that payable benefits continue to be paid until 2037, the difference representing the draw down of first interest on and ultimately principal from the current Trust Fund.</p>
<p>Which is our first point of departure. Current critics of Social Security often maintain that Trust Fund assets are not &#8216;real&#8217; or where they concede they are in fact real, maintain that they are not affordable. Now they couch these arguments in different terms that sound reasonable enough to them but which come across to supporters of Social Security as a confession along the lines of &#8220;Yes we are thieves and congenital liars and you were fools to believe us all along. And what are you going to do about it?&#8221;. Needless to say arguments that start from these very different premises often don&#8217;t end well.</p>
<p>So laying aside the &#8216;thief and liar&#8217; element for the moment how do these opponents interpret &#8216;crisis&#8217; based on the above figure? Well for them the redemption of the Trust Fund interest and principal is a pure burden starting essentially immediately and extending to 2037. At which point if nothing is done they get a huge tax cut. In constant 2010 dollars one in excess of $300 billion a year. Forever. After that Social Security limps along paying what it can from current tax dollars or between 75% and 78% of the schedule. Which isn&#8217;t their problem, instead 2037 is a get out of jail free card.<br />http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#180555</p>
<p>But as almost the flip side of opportunity, in this case tax cut, is danger. The biggest danger for this group is that retirees demand that the schedule be maintained ANYWAY, and worse that the gap be largely or entirely financed by taxes on people earning over the current payroll gap. Under this scenario the wealthy not only pay enough in taxes to keep benefits flowing but also to keep the Trust Funds in actuarial balance (100% of next year cost) meaning that they will ALSO HAVE TO CONTINUE PAYING INTEREST. It&#8217;s like a double nightmare.</p>
<p>Now oddly the Northwest Plan for a Real Social Security fix we push here at Angry Bear numerically works out as a medium term break for this group. By putting the burden of extra FICA on workers it reduces the role of the General Fund to just enough debt service to stabilize the Trust Funds at their mandated level, instead of having to pay 20% plus of Social Security costs during the last phase of redeeming the Trust Fund (the 2030s) they ultimately settle out paying around 5% of those costs servicing the debt. But instead they are rolling the dice in hopes of a better deal.</p>
<p>If Trust Fund Depletion in 2037 represents a potential tax cut for income tax payers what does it mean for retirees? Well under current law an immediate cut in benefits of 22%. And no argument from that Bruce Webb based on Rosser&#8217;s Equation is going to make that sticker shock go away, people don&#8217;t think that way. (For example the lack of a COLA for 2009 and 2010 actually is the result of retirees getting that increase EARLY and under a system that doesn&#8217;t allow for clawback. In reality they are all dollars ahead on net. Trust me they don&#8217;t get this. At all.)</p>
<p>So in the face of this psychological sticker shock that certainly would spark demands for ACTION. DAMMIT. YESTERDAY. how do the wealthy preserve their long term tax cut? Simple get retirees to take those cuts gradually starting as soon as possible and hope they don&#8217;t recognize that their resulting 2038 check still ends up as small or smaller than a plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; would provide.</p>
<p>None of this is about long term deficit reduction, if it was the wealthy would just work to enforce &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. After all that 22% 2037 reset in benefits also has the effect of wiping out all those trillions in &#8216;Unfunded Liability&#8217; the PGP/AEI folk like to tout. Under current law there is no unfunded liability, it is instead a theoretical construct that assumes that future retirees will demand that some or all the current benefit schedule is maintained. Which in the end is a political argument and not an economic one at all.</p>
<p>Returning to the figure the solution for current critics of Social Security is to get the &#8216;Scheduled&#8217; line down to the &#8216;Income line&#8217; while supporters are focused on getting the &#8216;Payable&#8217; line up to &#8216;Scheduled&#8217;. Even within the confines of this simple figure we are using two different sets of lines (a fact obscured that for the 2012 to 2037 period that &#8216;Scheduled&#8217; and &#8216;Payable&#8217; overlap). No wonder consensus seems unreachable, we don&#8217;t even agree on the nature of the Crisis.</p>
