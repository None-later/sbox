<div>from her blog <em>Tunnel Under Snow</em></p>
<p>A long <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/line-of-connection-in-experienced.html">discussion </a>over on Angry Bear dealt with how economic choices, rational in the short term or in the service of one economic actor, can cumulatively cripple the societies in which these choices are made. Well worth hopping over to read the full conversation, and also taking another hop to read the 1994 <a href="http://www.alanwattsentientsentinel.eu/english/transcripts/Alan_Watt_Blurb_Sir_James_Goldsmith_US_Senate_Speech_Oct192007.html">address </a>of Sir James Goldstein to the US Congress.<br />I added to the conversation, and was pleased enough with that <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/4657944481940633982/#730052">comment </a>that I lifted it for here.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />For some reason, this discussion is reminding me of the &#8220;dead spots&#8221; in the ocean where fertilizers poured in and encourage the growth of oxygen sucking algae.<br />Like so many other issues in economics, the issue of training versus skills versus cost of acquiring those skills rests on a matter of balance. How does a society support the acquisition of skills which are, when all is said and done, not going to be needed frequently enough to support a large number of artisans? I took a tour of an engineering firm a few years ago, where they make to order generators and motors. The men doing this work are all my age now, and will probably be retiring shortly. The workplace was not a factory floor as you would at ordinarily imagine it &#8212; instead it was like a very large workshop, and the &#8220;coils&#8221; inside the motors and generators were actually bent from lengthy slabs of specially shaped copper. I know for a fact that units produced by this company were integral to parts of the space program from the 1960s.<br />Motors, generators and transformers have shifted over the past 30 years to a very small number of producers, most of them offshore. Although I&#8217;m not in the field anymore, at the time I retired there were really only three or four producers of large power transformers, and the lead time for a single transformer might be three years. In some cases, there would effectively be only one producer because the others were not at that time taking new contracts.<br />In an emergency situation, how do you quickly replace a damaged transformer? They are not kept sitting on the shelf, one of these would be large enough that it would only fit in my two-story house if I removed strategic portions of flooring and walls.<br />The crisis of American manufacturing is not, I think, primarily one of job loss. It is instead the loss of capacity to rebuild oneself independently in a crisis. That capacity is only partly dependent on the infrastructure &#8212; the factory floors and steel mills. More importantly, the working knowledge of how these things are built and the working attitude of coming in every day and bending some more copper into shape, but doing it precisely right, have been punished out of the American workforce I believe.<br />To become skilled in one of these jobs often requires an opportunity loss of becoming skilled in other areas &#8212; in order to train a good machinist requires enough time that the skill becomes the individual&#8217;s only resource, and if that resource is no longer in demand, the entire field looks like that oceanic dead zone where there isn&#8217;t enough oxygen to survive.<br />A balanced diet includes many things &#8212; sugar and fat and protein in large amounts, and iron and chromium and zinc in tiny amounts. But if a person&#8217;s diet includes no trace elements they end up with deficiency diseases.<br />I think the loss of niche professions is a deficiency disease in a nation. Identifying and supporting these fields of work may not be financially efficient &#8212; it&#8217;s much easier to eat a candy bar than it is to eat a balanced diet. But the result of always making the candy-bar choice is a particular disease that weakens its host out of all proportion to the size of the elements needed.<br />Noni </div>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/12/friday-animations-estate-tax.html"><strong>Friday Animations&#8211;Estate Tax</strong></a><br />crossposted with <strong>Ataxingmatter</strong><br />[now updated to provide the animation feature&#8211;thanks to Steve Cook, at the Cook law firm, available <a target="_blank" href="http://cookazlaw.com/">here</a> and Ataxingmatter]</p>
<p>Well, not exactly an animation, but Estate tax attorney Douglas A. Cook has a chart on the Federal Estate Tax 2001-2011 (linked from the Wills, Trusts &#038; Estates Prof Blog) and also as an animation (see below).  Certainly a picture worth a thousand words in terms of showing that ordinary Americans are essentially not taxable under any version of the estate tax.  So what the Obama -GOP deal amounts to is a giveway to those few millionaires who had enough assets in the wrong category that they would actually have to pay some amount of tax&#8211;only about 5,500 estates under the 2009 version of the bill, about 145,000 in 2011 if the current laws (enacted under GW Bush) remain without any action by today&#8217;s Congress to change them, but even fewer than 5500 under the Obama deal for a $5 million exemption and a mere 35% top rate.</p>

<p><strong>An Economic Theory That Uses Micro Forces to Explain Macro Outcomes:  Why the Economy Stubbornly Insists on Growing More Slowly When Taxes are Lower</strong></p>
<p>Cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=256">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing for years about the fact that a basic piece of economic theory does not apply to real world US data:  unless one engages in the sort of assumptions that can justify eating ceramic plates as a cure for leprosy, there is simply no evidence that lower taxes lead to the good stuff we&#8217;ve been led to believe over non-cherry picked data sets.  Recent examples include <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=253">this look at the effect top federal marginal rates on various measures of growth</a>, <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=241">this look at the effect of top federal marginal rates on tax revenues</a>, <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=195">a different look at federal marginal rates and growth</a>, and <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?s=state+and+local&#038;x=0&#038;y=0">this look using state tax levels</a>.  I&#8217;ve also shown that effective tax rates also have fail to cooperate with theory when looking over the length of presidential administrations &#8211; examples include myriad <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=50">posts</a> and <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">Presimetrics</a>, the book I wrote with Michael Kanell.</p>
<p>I think the reason a lot of people have trouble accepting this is that they see some sort of conflict between this macro fact and and what seems to be a self-evident micro truth &#8211; if tax rates get high enough, people will work less.  Now, such micro-macro conflicts have existed in the past, and are certainly aren&#8217;t unique to economics.  One obvious example we all live with is that to each of us, from where we&#8217;re standing, the Earth does a pretty good job of appearing to be flat, and yet we know that its actually round(ish).  For most applications, from running a marathon to building a house to making toast, assuming that the earth is flat doesn&#8217;t hurt, and even simplifies matters.  That is to say, for most applications facing critters roughly our physical size, a flat earth is a good model.   On the other hand, we&#8217;d be much impoverished by sticking to that model at all times, as we&#8217;d lose out on satellites, our understanding of weather and geology, a great deal of transoceanic shipping, and Australia.  </p>
<p>The same thing is true when it comes to the economy &#8211; failing to understand and account for the dichotomy between micro and macro truths is harmful.  It has cost us, all 6.8 billion of us, economic growth and wealth, which is to say, it has cost us in quality and length of life.  But nobody is trying to explain that dichotomy, in part because so few people see it.  There is a profession that should be trying to explain this dichotomy, and that is the economic theorists. However, they seem to be pretending the data isn&#8217;t there, so waiting around them to explain it means more loss of quality and length of life.  So let me take a crack at it.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In addition to explaining the real world reasonably well, a good theory, in my opinion, should not rely on crazy assumptions.  After all, a theory that doesn&#8217;t make any sense simply isn&#8217;t going to get used even in the unlikely event that it works.  So I came up with a theory that relies on only a few assumptions, all of which are sane and which hew pretty close to the real world.  My assumptions are these:</p>
<p>1.  Economic actors react to incentives more or less rationally.  (Feel free to assume &#8220;rational expectations&#8221; if you have some attachment to the current state of affairs in macro, but it won&#8217;t change results much.) <br />1a.  The probability that an economic agent will choose to do any work is inversely related the tax rate.  At 100% tax on income, work drops, but not to zero &#8211; many of us do some charity work, after all, for which we aren&#8217;t compensated at all.  On the other hand, not everyone is going to work even if tax rates drop to 0%.  <br />2.  Economic actors do not have perfect information about the economy, and are not homogeneous.  They have different skillsets and different size, and that limits their opportunities at any given time. On the other hand, some economic actors are sufficiently similar to other economic actors that they could occupy similar economic niches, albeit they wouldn&#8217;t necessarily produce identical output.<br />3.  Economic actors come in different sizes.  Small players cannot compete with large players on economies of scale.  (I get really irritated with the oft-repeated assumption that everyone is the same size, or that any unemployed person can walk into a bank and borrow $1.2 billion to build a chip fab.)<br />4.  Economic actors are at least somewhat risk averse.<br />5.  Many parts of the economy are characterized by economies of scale.  At some point those economies of scale may reverse themselves, but economic actors rarely work at points where the diseconomies of scale have become strong.<br />6.  Many parts of the economy are characterized by lumpiness.  If an economic player is into hot dog stands, for instance, it can buy one hot dog stand, or two, or three, but it can&#8217;t buy 2.7183 hot dog stands.  <br />7.  Among the the pieces of the economy characterized by economies of scale and lumpiness are tax evasion/avoidance, which economic actors will engage in due to assumption number 1.  That is to say, $1,000 spent on attorneys, accountants and economists in the course of a $100,000 project will gets you less tax evasion/avoidance than the same amount (or even a proportionately larger amount) spent in the course of a $100,000,0000 project.  <br />8.  There is a government that collects taxes.  (Note &#8211; In a nod to the libertarian folks, we don&#8217;t even have to assume anything about what the government does with the taxes.  Whether the government burns the money it collects in a bonfire, or uses it to fund road building and control epidemics more efficiently than the private sector can won&#8217;t change the basic conclusions of the model.)  </p>
<p>I trust there aren&#8217;t any assumptions on this list that seem particularly heroic or which contradict the real world in any important way.  Additionally, I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything here that a conservative or libertarian would object to either.  So I figure we&#8217;re good to go.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s focus on one particular economic actor (or entity or firm or player), and let&#8217;s put some numbers down for simplicity of keeping track of going on.  Say this one actor has $100 million (whether debt or equity is irrelevant to the model) which it can invest &#8211; and it can invest all, part, or none of that $100 million.  To keep things really simple, say this actor must decide how to allocate its funds between a single $100 million investment and five $20 million investments, each of which has an expected return of X% a year before taxes. </p>
<p>Essentially, this player has four forces acting upon its decision making process.</p>
<p>1.  Risk aversion.  That makes the actor lean away from the one big project and toward some number of the smaller projects, both to avoid having all its eggs in one basket, and because by avoiding the one big project it doesn&#8217;t have to invest the full $100 million.  Instead of investing in five small projects, for instance, it can invest in four at a cost of $80 million, and keep $20 million cash.  <br />2.  Economies of scale.  That makes the actor lean toward the one big project over the five smaller projects.  <br />3.  The marginal tax rate.  If its too high, that actor will simply sit on its hands.  If not, it will invest some amount of its $100 million. <br />4.  Economies of scale in tax avoidance/evasion.  That tends to lead toward the one big project over the five smaller projects, since the net benefits of tax avoidance from one big project exceed the net benefits of tax avoidance from several small projects.  </p>
<p>Now, forces 1 and 2 push in opposite directions.  Force 3 is orthogonal to 1 and 2, and force 4 is parallel to force 2.  All of which means it is easy for a player who chooses to invest rather than sit on his hands, and who otherwise is evenly balanced between one large and multiple small projects (or even tilting slightly toward multiple small projects) by forces 1 and 2 to be pushed toward the one big project by force 4.  Let me restate &#8211; under some circumstances, marginal tax rates are low enough not to preclude investment altogether, but are high enough that due to scale economies, the gains of tax avoidance/evasion from large projects so exceed the gains to tax avoidance/evasion from small projects to make a single large project more desirable than a group of small projects, even though the latter would have been more desirable in the absence of taxes.  Furthermore, there is some positive probability that shrinking marginal tax rates reduces force 4 enough to keep this story from being true.  </p>
<p>This follows in a straightforward way from the assumptions, and looks a lot like real world situations.  I assume its not objectionable even if you&#8217;re fortunate not to have ever worked for a Big 4 accounting firm.   But, it has important implications.  See, by taking the single big project rather than the multiple small projects, our player increases economic growth several ways.  These include:</p>
<p>1.  Because of project lumpiness, by going the big project route, it has to invest the full $100 million.  Had it gone the small project route, there is a positive probability that risk aversion would have led it to invest $80 million (or $60 million) instead, meaning $20 million (or $40 million) would not have been put to work in the economy.<br />2.  It spends less on tax avoidance/evasion services with the single large project than with multiple small projects.  Since these services produce a private gain but don&#8217;t actually generate output, that reduces the drag on the economy.  <br />3.  As noted previously, small players are reluctant to take on big players &#8211; sure, it happens, but in general, small players prefer to go up against other small players than against big players.  (Think Walmart and the centipede game.)  But small players are priced out of the big projects.  So if small players find bigger guys entering their potential space, they are more likely to sit on their hands (or focus on what amounts to the smaller, more wasteful projects among options available to them, potentially forcing out the even smaller guys, etc.). </p>
<p>But that is one single player.  In a big enough economy, there can be many, many companies and/or individuals of many different sizes in just such a situation.  With 310 million people and who knows how many companies in the economy, probabilities add up.  (I note that the second benefit of biasing companies toward their largest available projects goes away when you consider the whole economy.  After all, while company X saves on accountants/attorneys and economists by picking the larger projects, by leaving the smaller projects to smaller players, those players will be hiring accountants/attorneys and economists as well.)</p>
<p>Note that relaxing a few assumptions makes it even easier to understand why US macro data shows a positive correlation between marginal tax rates and real economic growth.  For instance, it isn&#8217;t difficult to imagine that the government actually does something useful (i.e., growth generating) with the some of the tax money it collects.  Additionally, smaller firms are often more innovative than larger firms, even within the same space (one has to compete somehow).  Our little story is one where under many circumstances, smaller firms are more likely to enter the market when tax rates rise than when tax rates fall.  </p>
<p>Thus, this little story, while requiring only a few realistic assumptions, does something that as far as I know is unique in the field of economics:  it explains why US macro data shows a positive correlation between the top marginal tax rates and economic growth for all but the most cherry picked data sets, and it does it by sticking to micro foundations.  I&#8217;m sure it could be improved, but but I think its a good start.  Your thoughts?</p>

Reader juan adds his commentary to Marty Hart-Landsberg quotes (lifted from comments and slightly editied for readability):</p>
<blockquote><p>Most importantly, foreign capital now plays a leading role in the Chinese economy, especially in manufacturing.7 Its activity has transformed China into an export-driven economy: the ratio of exports to GDP climbed from 16 percent in 1990 to over 40 percent in 2006, with the share of foreign produced exports growing from 2 percent in 1985 to 58 percent in 2005 (and 88 percent for high-tech exports).8 Equally noteworthy, the share of total exports being produced by 100 percent foreign-owned firms has also soared. </p>
<p>This restructuring cannot be understood simply through a nation-state lens. Rather, as China’s reforms proceeded over the 1990s, Chinese accumulation dynamics became increasingly dependent on transnational corporate investment and export activity. As a consequence, the Chinese economy became more and more enmeshed in a broader process of East Asian restructuring&#8212;one that was driven by the establishment and intensification of transnational, corporate controlled, cross-border production networks, which linked and collectively reshaped all the economies involved. In other words, the Chinese experience, and in particular, its export drive, can only be understood in the context of broader capitalist dynamics. </p>
<p>Chinese exports are really Chinese only in the sense that they were assembled in China. This point is reinforced by the fact that China’s increased share of the U.S. deficit was matched by a decline in the share accounted for by the rest of East Asia.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Juan re-states</em>: It is not so much a question of the US. v China but government that are in <strong>dependent partnerships</strong> with &#8216;no-longer-national&#8217; capital &#8212; which ultimately boils down to labor v capital, and this capital must control or be the state.</p>
<p>Given decades of class war from above, it is at least slightly more obvious what must be done.</p>

<p><strong>The Opposite of Survivor</strong></p>
<p>I hated the very idea of “Survivor” from the beginning, and happily<br />avoided seeing any more than a cumulative 30 minutes over the years of<br />Survivor shows worldwide.</p>
<p>Dropping people on desert islands isn’t the problem.  It’s one of the<br />oldest folk and literary stories around, full of danger and learning<br />and suffering and occasionally success.  In actuality, surviving is a<br />story repeated thousands of times in human history, as we left Africa<br />and learned to live everywhere else.  We sought new fields, or ran<br />away from each other, or simply got lost, but whatever the motivation<br />we left our old ways and learned new ones and became scattered tribes<br />of heroes.  I confess I was excited when I first heard the &#8220;Survivor&#8221;<br />idea, it could be wonderful.</p>
<p>Ah, no.  They spoiled it, but they spoiled it by stacking the deck.<br />To win on the show required the very strategies guaranteed to torpedo<br />a real survivor situation.  It’s like having parachute competitions<br />where the goal is to fall the fastest.  You can contrive such a<br />situation, but your safety nets better be damn good.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Since 1992, the hugely popular Survivor franchise set before us a<br />falsehood, demonstrating and rewarding behaviour that is the<br />antithesis of real survival.  And we are now living out the results of<br />that anti-story in our economy.</p>
<p>Seeing our predator enemies as powerful leaders, seeing our fellow<br />citizens as competitors to be scorned or scuttled, seeing long term<br />planning as fairytale thinking while praising short term looting &#8212; by<br />almost any measure, the “Survivor” economy is guaranteed to make us<br />poorer, weaker, and less safe.</p>
<p>Only one Survivor-type show that I know of tried to do the real thing.<br /> The Canadian broadcaster CBC did a show about homesteading in 1850s<br />Manitoba, a prairie province just north of North Dakota.  You’ve never<br />seen the show, nor have the rest of the Survivor fans, I bet.  It had<br />real worry, real privation, real hard work.  One of the two families<br />had to bail out due to illness.  That was the only safety net the show<br />provided.  150 years ago that family might have died instead.  They<br />surely would have died if they had hit upon a strategy of eliminating<br />their neighbours one by one in order to be the only survivor.  If the<br />untreated illness hadn’t killed such players, the surviving neighbours<br />surely would have.</p>
<p>We need to remember that if something is fictional, that doesn’t mean<br />people don’t learn from it.  Stories map out our patterns of thought,<br />as individuals and as societies.  If those stories are warped to<br />become their opposites, flavoured with gossip, excitement and<br />competition,  packaged and then force-fed to happy consumers for a<br />couple of decades, is it reasonable to expect nothing would come of<br />it?</p>

<p>Andrea Hayley writes: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/46986/">Chinese State-Controlled Market Policies Increasingly Unfavorable to the U.S.</a> in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/">The Epoch Times</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Deeply concerned about an unsustainable trade deficit with China, the chair and commissioner of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) say that in order to compete with China’s state-controlled economic policies, the U.S. government needs to significantly shift its current market-based approach.</p>
<p>“A lot of our major competitors have game plans. The United States doesn’t have a game plan, and our people are suffering,” said Patrick A. Mulloy last Friday at the Center for National Policy.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Mulloy, a USCC commissioner, and Daniel Slane, chairman of the commission, were keynote speakers of a talk, “Competing with China: How the U.S. Can Create Jobs in the 21st Century.”</p>
<p>The commissioners both said the U.S. free market system is at a disadvantage in our trading relationship with China, and that the government needs to take action to protect American interests at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Over the last nine years since China ascended to the World Trade Organization (WTO), it has amassed a $1.76 trillion trade surplus with the United States. The most common reason cited for the imbalance is China’s undervaluation of their currency, the RMB (yuan).</p>
<p>The House acted this September to pass a resolution raising the threat of import tariffs should China fail to raise the value of its currency to an appropriate level.</p>
<p>Related Articles<br />■China Blocks WikiLeaks <br />■China’s CPI May Have Been Intentionally Underestimated (Video)<br />While the currency issue is important, Mulloy said he doesn’t think it is the silver bullet. “I think the problem is a little deeper than that,” he said.</p>
<p>Mulloy is more concerned about the cumulative result of Chinese policies that require U.S. companies to exchange technology and know-how in exchange for access to their markets.</p>
<p>China’s industrial policies lure foreign companies to outsource production with offers of incentives, subsidies, and lower labor costs, and in order to take advantage of these lucrative offers, U.S. companies are required to transfer technology and know-how to the Chinese. This has been going on for years.</p>
<p>But recently, China has started asserting its economic muscle, and its companies are increasingly directly competing with U.S. companies, with China’s government policies granting domestic manufacturers the upper hand.</p>
<p>For example, China has started manufacturing commercial airplanes.</p>
<p>“China is going to make its own aircraft, and China is going to buy its own aircraft,” said Mulloy.</p>
<p>Recently, China’s indigenous policy has changed the playing field. Referred to in the USCC report as a &#8220;profound change,&#8221; the policy explicitly favors domestic companies over foreign firms for government procurement contracts.</p>
<p>One of the positive effects of China’s ascendance to the WTO, the ability of U.S. companies to make profits selling to China’s rising middle class, is not likely to pan out.</p>
<p>Slane sees current U.S. trade policy as a recipe for disaster. He recommends changes, such as replacing corporate income tax with a value added tax (VAT), an increase in research and development funding, and stronger patent protections with the goal of supporting U.S. manufacturing to balance the trade deficit.</p>
<p>Slane acknowledges that such changes would be “deeply disruptive to global commerce,” and lead to higher costs on goods purchased in the United States, but maintains it is a price Americans should be willing to pay.</p>
<p>“If we want to bring back manufacturing our government must acknowledge it is a new day in which other governments are practicing state-controlled capitalism, while we practice free market capitalism. It should be obvious that this is not a level playing field,” said Slane.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Global trade in the slogans of politics and media means outsourcing at the moment, and currency disputes, but a global economy has implications many Americans have not experienced in any large and macro way, and suggests there are other implications to consider:</p>
<p>Here are some key paragraphs from an article by <a target="_blank" href="http://michael-hudson.com/2010/07/dollar-hegemony-and-the-rise-of-china">Michael Hudson</a> (Hat tip reader rayllove):  </p>
<blockquote><p>China already is seeking to buy mineral, fuel and agricultural resources abroad to supply the inputs that it needs for its own growth. But these efforts still leave substantial foreign exchange surpluses. Most countries have used these surpluses to buy up key sectors of foreign economies. This is what Britain, the United States and France have done for more than a century.&#8221;  </p>
<p>&#8220;When the US economy runs payments surpluses with foreign countries, it insists that they pay for their foreign debts and ongoing trade deficits by opening up their markets and “restore balance” by selling their key public infrastructure, industries, mineral rights and commanding heights to US investors. But the US Government has blocked foreign countries from doing the same with the United States. This asymmetry has been a major factor causing the inequality between high US private-sector returns and low foreign official returns on their dollar holdings.&#8221;  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;The refusal of the US Government to behave symmetrically by not letting China buy key US companies with the dollar inflows that enter China to buy its own companies, above all its financial and banking sector, is largely responsible for the asymmetrical situation noted above, in which US investors earn 20% in China, but China earns only 1% in the US.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Our colleague PGL offers this take at <strong>Econospeak</strong> on the new deal  this week:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2010/12/supply-side-economics-tea-party-style.html">Supply-side Economics: Tea Party Style</a>
<p><a href="http://www.salon.com/technology/how_the_world_works/2010/12/07/republicans_balk_at_unemployment_tax_cut_deal">Andrew Leonard</a> covers the opposition to the Obama-McConnell tax deal coming from Tea Party star Michele Bachman. I’m tempted to say that her comments make me feel 30 years younger (with the hesitation that this is the 30-year anniversary of when some twit named Mark David Chapman murdered John Lennon). After all, 30 years ago we were mocking supply-siders and their Laugher Curve.  <br /><a name="more"></a> <br /> Andrew notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>And as for what the country can afford? The total cost of the tax cut package unveiled yesterday, counting the extension of all the Bush tax cuts, the new payroll tax cut, the unemployment benefit extension and the reinstated (at a historically low level) estate tax comes to around $800 billion-$900 billion over the next two years. The cost of extending unemployment benefits for 13 months is about $60 billion. If your worry is &#8220;massive spending&#8221; then there are more appropriate places to direct your ire than unemployment benefits &#8230; we should looking very closely at which tax cuts or social welfare policies are most likely to give us the biggest bang for the buck, in terms of encouraging economic growth. And on that score, spending money on unemployment benefits gets a very high rating. Extending unemployment benefits is a sensible move for a government when it is stretched for funds when economic growth is slow and the goal is to increase demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Michele Bachman’s world – is $60 billion much larger than $800 billion? Or does she really believe reducing taxes does not add to the deficit? The latter seems to be the world Art Laffer lives in. Of course, Laffer might argue that fiscal stimulus ala tax cuts will increase real GDP. The endorsement of the Obama-McConnell tax deal from the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/254636/qualified-victory-taxes-editors">National Review</a> certainly sounded very Keynesian:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>But the deal is still worth taking: If it won’t do much good for the economy, it will avert a serious blow to it.</p>
<p>Of course, a temporary tax cut on the very well to do likely is not going to generate much in the way of additional consumption demand, which is why increase government spending has a bigger bang for the buck. While Tea Party types say they’d like to reduce unemployment, they oppose even modest increases in government spending. And while they say they abhor deficits, they want large tax cuts with little bang for the buck. Go figure!</p>
