German prices are very sticky, since the domestic economy doesn’t see the boom and bust cyclical behavior like that in other developed economies. However, inflation may headed north, especially if the trend in <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-04112010-AP/EN/4-04112010-AP-EN.PDF">industrial prices (PPI)</a>, a +3.8% annual clip, is any leading indicator. <em>(Click on chart to enlarge.)</em></p>
<p>Will German policymakers see the inflation for what it is? It’s a shift in relative prices to drive real German appreciation in order to rebalance current accounts across the region amid a fixed currency regime.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The Eurozone region is now characterized by current account imbalances, imbalances that are now being addressed through fiscal austerity measures. According to the IMF October <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/02/index.htm">2010 World Economic Outlook</a>, Germany will run the second largest current account surplus in the Eurozone as a percentage of GDP this year (second to Luxembourg), 6.1%, while Greece and Portugal will run the largest deficits, -10.8% and -10%, respectively. Among the bigger economies, Spain’s 2010 current account deficit sticks out at -5.2% of GDP. In fact, just 6 of the 16 Eurozone economies are expected to run current account surpluses in 2010.</p>
<p>If these fiscal austerity measures are to succeed in Europe, the hardest hit economies – Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Greece – must generate income externally via export growth. In order to gain export growth, competitiveness must be drawn upon in one of three ways (or a combination): (1) the nominal exchange rate depreciates in the debtor countries (CA deficit countries); (2) final goods prices fall in the debtor countries relative to the creditor countries; or (3) unit labor costs fall in the debtor countries relative to the creditor countries. Any combination of the three will shift the real exchange rate in favor of the debtor countries and drive export growth.</p>
<p>Since (1), depreciation of the nominal exchange rate, is clearly not an option in the single-currency Eurozone, it’s up to (2) and (3). I’ve talked about <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/03/end-game-for-europe-wage-cutting-and.html">wage-cutting</a>; and most of the fiscal austerity packages include some degree of public sector wage cuts, so I won&#8217;t address that here. And point (2) has been addressed mostly via fiscal austerity dragging price pressures domestically, and leading to increased competitiveness. But point (2) can be seen from another light&#8230;</p>
<p><strong><em>&#8230;it&#8217;s all about relative prices, and inflation in Germany realtive to the debtor countries can establish competitiveness in debtor countries.</em></strong></p>
<p>German inflation is important for two reasons.</p>
<p>First, it&#8217;s all about relative prices (point 2 above), so competitiveness in Spain, for example, could similarly be generated if German inflation rises relative to that in Spain, holding Spanish inflation constant – even more so if Spain’s inflation rate is falling . In fact, a rather stark increase in German inflation is likely needed to generate a rebalancing effect when nominal depreciation is out of the question (as is the case for the Eurozone).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TNnPQSP9JSI/AAAAAAAADX8/IFqzLT4eP5Y/s1600/CAGR_inflation_eurozone.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TNnPQSP9JSI/AAAAAAAADX8/IFqzLT4eP5Y/s320/CAGR_inflation_eurozone.JPG" border="0"></a>On to the second reason why German inflation is important: the ECB average inflation target.</p>
<p>The table to the left illustrates the compounded annual rate of inflation (CAGR) for each of the current member Eurozone economies since 2000. Germany has, on average, seen prices rise at a 1.7% annual rate, while Spain has seen prices rise at a 2.9% annual rate.</p>
<p>Amid fiscal austerity, German inflation is needed is to keep the ECB’s target average inflation rate– the average inflation rate is the weighted HICP across all of the Eurozone economies – around 2% while the much of the Eurozone experiences disinflation (or deflation).</p>
<p>Spanning 2000-2009, the Spanish economy contributed roughly 0.4% to the Euro area&#8217;s average 2.1% annual inflation (based on the HICP country weight, which is 12.6% &#8211; see the <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/product_details/publication?p_product_code=KS-QA-10-043">Eurostat publication for links to the data</a>). Greece contributed roughly 0.1%, on average, to overall inflation. Going forward, there will be a lot of inflation slack to be picked up as these economies <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/02/pdf/tables.pdf">contract further</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>It’s gotta be Germany!</strong></em></p>
<p>But will German policymakers and its massive export sector tolerate higher average annual inflation? Let’s say at roughly 3%, and for some time? I’m skeptical – so the outlook for the Eurozone, in my view, has just worsened.</p>

<p>By the way, I just told my German husband, Herr Wilder, about this article. You know what his response was? &#8220;<em>Oh&#8230;Germans don&#8217;t like inflation</em>.&#8221; Enough said.</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Mike Kimel</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post WW2 Private Investment v. New Deal Private Investment</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=224">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>I had a post the other day (which appeared at <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=214">the Presimetrics blog</a> and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/very-bad-economic-theory.html">Angry Bear</a>, and which was followed up by my fellow Angry Bear, Spencer, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/follow-up-by-spencer-to-kimels-wwll.html">here</a>) looking at a paper by David R. Henderson about the supposed <a href="http://mercatus.org/sites/default/files/publication/U.S.%20Postwar%20Miracle.Henderson.11.4.10.pdf">post-World War 2 economic boom</a>.  </p>
<p>I noted that his view fit into a libertarian/conservative story line, but required not only assuming the GDP (or GNP) data from WW2 is wrong, but also that the data at least through the early &#8217;50s is wrong too, despite the fact that the data fits other known facts pretty well.  By contrast, Henderson&#8217;s story conflicts with known facts in a number of places.</p>
<p>However, there is one point &#8211; another libertarian/conservative myth which comes up in the paper that I&#8217;d like to focus on in this post.  Henderson tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why did the economy do much better after the war than at the beginning? We can’t know for sure, but the most likely explanation is the change in administration from Roosevelt, who championed central government planning of the economy, to Truman, who was much less inclined to support government control. </p></blockquote>
<p>Also see <a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2010/11/does-1920-21-recession-really-prove.html?utm_">Econospeak&#8217;s Prof. Rosser on 1920-21 recession</a><br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>See, </p>
<blockquote><p>Before the United States entered into World War II, the New Dealers—the faction of Franklin Roosevelt’s administration that was most hostile to economic freedom—had significant power.  During the war, they were largely displaced by more pragmatic people who were not hostile to free markets (thus the quote from Henry Stimson at the beginning of this section).</p></blockquote>
<p>Moving on&#8230; </p>
<blockquote><p>Roosevelt’s death cleared the way for President Harry Truman. Although he was a New Dealer, Truman had no love for “the long-haired boys” who were associated with the most anti-market parts of the New Deal—people such as Ben Cohen, William O. Douglas, trust-buster Thurman Arnold, price controller Leon Henderson, and Felix Frankfurter. In 1945 and 1946, Truman got rid of a number of New Dealers, including two of the most prominent ones: former vice president Henry Wallace and Harold Ickes.28</p>
<p>Higgs points out that the polling data bear out the perception of a regime change under Truman. As a result of the change, writes Higgs, “Investors were then much more willing to hazard their private property than they had been before the war, as both survey data and financial market data confirm.”29</p>
<p>And invest they did. As table 2 shows, gross private domestic investment in real 1964 dollars was $44.4 billion in 1941. For all the war years it was half or less of that 1941 level. In 1946, it shot up to $51.7 billion, grew slightly to $51.8 billion in 1947, and then grew to $60.6 billion in 1948.</p></blockquote>
<p>So essentially, Henderson&#8217;s belief is that there was a boom after WW2 and that it was caused because greater economic freedom encouraged more private investment.  We&#8217;ve already dealt with the supposed boom, but what about private investment?  Was private investment really booming in the post-WW2 era relative to the pre-WW2 era?  Simply put, no, as is evident from the following graph, constructed using data from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=6&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaBox=no#Mid">NIPA table 1.1.6</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TNilcSs9gzI/AAAAAAAAAco/60cDAiVkeFg/s1600/Henderson,_2nd_Pass,_Figure_1.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TNilcSs9gzI/AAAAAAAAAco/60cDAiVkeFg/s320/Henderson,_2nd_Pass,_Figure_1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>From the graph, its pretty obvious that the New Deal easily beat Henderson&#8217;s post-WW2 boom when it comes to encouraging private investment.  The explanation for why is obvious to anyone who has not bought into libertarian or conservative beliefs about how the economy works.</p>

We can and will deal with competition and industrial dominance from a low-wage/high-pollution country or company by doing what all of you people around here do. We can use brains rather than brawn to design better, more mechanised, ways of ensuring our supply of what we need to keep industry on its feet.</p></blockquote>

<p>David Cay Johnston, former tax reporter for the New York Times, now does a column in the weekly Tax Notes called &#8220;Johnston&#8217;s Take.&#8221;  This week, he examines Alan Viard&#8217;s claim that the child-care credit is a boon for working parents.   <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/files/who-benefits-from-child-care-credit.110810.pdf">Download Who Benefits from child-care credit.110810</a></p>
<p>Viard is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Enterprise_Institute">American Enterprise Institute </a>economist/scholar in residence, joining Paul Wolfowitz, Lynne Cheney and other prominent names from the Bush right-wing support squad.  He has touted the child care tax credit and gotten some supporters.  For example,  legislation was introduced in the House this spring to increase the credit and remove the income limitation, so that even well-to-do couples could get the full credit (current law limits credit to $600 for familes with income above $43,000).  See Martin Vaughn, <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704250104575238531602862848.html">House Plan Targets Child Care Tax Credit</a>, Wall St. Journal, May 11, 2010.</p>
<p>Johnston argues that the incidence of the child tax credit, like the corporate income tax, is uncertain.  (The corporate tax may be borne by shareholders, but it may also be passed off to employees, vendors or customers.  That, of course, is if there is any tax paid at all&#8230;.)  The credit is not so obviously a benefit to those who ostensibly receive its benefit.  Johnston works through some simple formulas to show how wages decline with the availability of the credit&#8211;both because employers can pay less (since the government is in effect picking up part of the tab) and more employees come into the labor market because of the credit (which lowers wages because of the increased supply of labor).</p>

<p>http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/07/opinion/07rich.html?_r=1</p>
<p>It is an interesting approach.</p>
<p>But I would do him one better.</p>
<p>I would suggest to Obama that he offers the Republicans a deal for the Bush tax cuts for those making more than $250,000.   Offer to sign legislation for this tax cut only if the legislation  also contained spending cuts to offset every Penney of revenues lost to the tax cuts.</p>
<p>While he is at it ,offer the same deal on the inheritances tax.</p>
<p>Remember, the legislation will also have to go through the Senate before it gets to the White House and to get through the Senate will require a certain number of democratic votes.</p>
<p>Yes, the republicans ran on a platform of cutting spending.  But if history is any indicator<br />the &#8220;borrow and spend&#8221; party will not be able to put together a piece of legislation actually  cutting spending.</p>
<p>Obama should take a hard nose stance and call the republicans bluff on this.  The democrats ability to get health care reform through Congress suggest they have the ability to play hardball. So show the republicans that the democrats can really play hardball on this.</p>
<p>I do not believe the republicans will be able to deliver.  When it comes to spending, as they say in Texas, the republicans are all hat and no cattle.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>A year and a half ago I put up a post here called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/03/fierce-urgency-of-nothing-democratic.html">The Fierce Urgency of &#8216;Nothing&#8217;</a> whose conclusion was:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Nothing&#8221;. The numerically proven plan for Social Security since 1997.</p></blockquote>
<p> So you can imagine my gratification at running across the following by the co-author of the must read book from 1999 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a>, economist and co-director of CEPR (Center for Economic and Policy Research) Dean Baker.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/action-on-social-security-the-urgent-need-for-delay">Action on Social Security: the Urgent Need for Delay</a><br />
<blockquote>There is enormous public confusion (much of it deliberately cultivated) about the extent of Social Security’s projected shortfall. Many policymakers and analysts point out that projections from the Congressional Budget Office and the Social Security Trustees show the program to be out of balance in the long-term, therefore we would be best advised to make changes as soon as possible. This paper argues that supporters of the existing Social Security system should try to ensure that no major changes to the core program are implemented in the immediate future. It points out that:<br />There is good reason for believing that the public will be better informed about the financial state of Social Security in the future, in part because of the weakening of some of the main sources of misinformation;<br />Many more people will be directly dependent on Social Security in the near future. These people and their families will likely be strong defenders of the program;<br />The group of near-retirees, who may be the victims of early action, will desperately need their Social Security since they have seen much of their wealth eliminated with the collapse of the housing bubble; and<br />The concern over “maintaining the confidence of financial markets” is an empty claim that can be used to justify almost any policy.</p></blockquote>
<p>The full paper in PDF can be found at this link <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/ss-2010-11-1.pdf">The Urgent Need for Delay</a>. And if I say so myself goes a long way towards explaining the justification of my previous post from Sept. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/why-nothing-is-still-2nd-best-plan-for.html">Why &#8216;Nothing&#8221; is STILL the 2nd Best Plan for Social Security</a>. I am doing what I can here at AB  to make sure that &#8220;the public will be better informed about the financial state of Social Security in the future&#8221;, but you could do worse than taking the word from the Leader of the Pack. Because Dean has been on this beat even longer than I have, and is a real economist to boot. Go Read!!</p>

                                <p>lifted from <strong>comments by spencer </strong>on <strong>Mike Kimel&#8217;s</strong> post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/very-bad-economic-theory.html">Very bad economic theory (historiography)</a></p>
<p>From <a target="_blank href=" http:>Real Civilian GDP</a> in July this year.</p>
<blockquote><p>From 1933 to 1950 real civilian GDP grew at a 5.6% growth rate even though it fell -18.4% and -14.8% in  <br />1943 and 1944 &#8212; a decline about the same as the drop in 1929-33. </p></blockquote>
<p>The analysis that the economy boomed after WW II by Henderson is really bad analysis, largely because it omits so much information, some of which Mike has pointed out.  But mainly it omits the information on &#8220;forced savings&#8221; during WW II that provided people the means to finance the post war increase in spending.  To say the post war economy happened without government policy playing a significant role is just blatantly misleading and dishonest.  Second, no one brought up the question of what happened to all the women who had been drawn into the labor force during WW II like by mother who was a Rosy the Riveter in the local aluminum plant in eastern Tennessee.  Like most of her fellow female workers she silently went home and started having babies.  In other words they dropped out of the labor force and this created openings for the returning servicemen.  This movement in and out of the labor force of female wartime workers massively distorted the data but of course no is pointing this out in the analysis. That is why the labor force contracted in 1946.  Note Henderson did not say anything about this.  </p>
<p>Moreover, his analysis of Germany is just as blatantly misleading in that it says nothing about the Marshall Plan or the German currency reform.   The German recovery did not really start until after the currency reform of 1948.</p>

                                <p>By Daniel Becker</p>
<p>I just want to lay out the debate going on in our economy right now. There are 4 debaters. President Obama/Geithner et al, President Obama 2008, the rich (or capitalist, those who make their money from money) and the rest of us. </p>
<p>From President Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/07/60minutes/main7032277.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody">60 Minute interview</a>: </p>
<p>
<blockquote>PRESIDENT OBAMA:&#8230;And it turns out that actually the people who are most likely to use that money and spend that money are actually people of more modest means, and if what we&#8217;re concerned about is how we can grow the economy, there are more efficient ways to recirculate dollars out there and get people to spend.</p>
<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA:&#8230;But probably the biggest uncertainty right now for a lotta companies is there gonna be enough demand out there for the products, and we&#8217;ve gotta make sure that we&#8217;re workin&#8217; with them to try to improve that. </p>
<p>KROFT: You&#8217;ve got a situation right now that banks have not significantly loosened up credit in spite of all the money that they&#8217;ve received, in spite of the fact that they&#8217;re quite profitable right now. And you&#8217;ve got manufacturing companies that haven&#8217;t replaced many of the jobs or hired back the people that they&#8217;ve cut. How do you get the banks to loan money, and how do you get businesses to hire people back? </p>
<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, it starts with businesses wanting to hire people back because they see customers out there. And so everything that we can do to expand consumer confidence, everything that we can do to get businesses to invest in plants and equipment through the tax code, through accelerated depreciation, through keeping taxes on middle class families where they are, as opposed to having them spike up &#8212; all that can make a difference. The more companies are doing well, the more likely they are to go to banks and say, &#8220;We need to borrow.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The two Obama&#8217;s are struggling to have it both ways and thus the lack of action on issues such as easing unionization while going to <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/801-economy/127651-ford-slams-south-korea-trade-deal-as-obama-officials-renew-talks">South Korea for a trade deal</a> ala <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/106607-south-korean-trade-deal-pits-obama-against-labor-">NAFTA</a>. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />However, the other 2 parties in this debate have been very clear for years now. I present “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102609/quotes">Other People&#8217;s Money” 1991</a> </p>
<p>The Capitalist represented by Lawrence Garfield:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Ah, but we can&#8217;t,&#8221; goes the prayer. &#8220;We can&#8217;t because we have responsibility, a responsibility to our employees, to our community. What will happen to them?&#8221; I got two words for that: Who cares? Care about them? Why? They didn&#8217;t care about you. They sucked you dry. You have no responsibility to them. For the last ten years this company bled your money. Did this community ever say, &#8220;We know times are tough. We&#8217;ll lower taxes, reduce water and sewer.&#8221; Check it out: You&#8217;re paying twice what you did ten years ago. And our devoted employees, who have taken no increases for the past three years, are still making twice what they made ten years ago; and our stock &#8211; one-sixth what it was ten years ago. Who cares? I&#8217;ll tell you. Me. I&#8217;m not your best friend. I&#8217;m your only friend. I don&#8217;t make anything? I&#8217;m making you money. And lest we forget, that&#8217;s the only reason any of you became stockholders in the first place. You want to make money! You don&#8217;t care if they manufacture wire and cable, fried chicken, or grow tangerines! You want to make money! I&#8217;m the only friend you&#8217;ve got. I&#8217;m making you money. Take the money. Invest it somewhere else. Maybe, maybe you&#8217;ll get lucky and it&#8217;ll be used productively. And if it is, you&#8217;ll create new jobs and provide a service for the economy and, God forbid, even make a few bucks for yourselves. And if anybody asks, tell &#8217;em ya gave at the plant. And by the way, it pleases me that I am called &#8220;Larry the Liquidator.&#8221; You know why, fellow stockholders? Because at my funeral, you&#8217;ll leave with a smile on your face and a few bucks in your pocket. Now that&#8217;s a funeral worth having! </p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of us represented by Andrew Jorgenson:</p>
<blockquote><p>“&#8230;The entrepreneur of post-industrial America, playing God with other people&#8217;s money. The robber barons of old at least left something tangible in their wake- a coal mine, a railroad, banks. This man leaves nothing. He creates nothing. He builds nothing. He runs nothing. And in his wake lies nothing but a blizzard of paper to cover the pain. Oh, if he said, &#8220;I know how to run your business better than you,&#8221; that would be something worth talking about. But he&#8217;s not saying that. He&#8217;s saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna kill you because at this particular moment in time, you&#8217;re worth more dead than alive.&#8221; Well, maybe that&#8217;s true, but it is also true that one day this industry will turn. One day when the yen is weaker, the dollar is stronger, or when we finally begin to rebuild our roads, our bridges, the infrastructure of our country, demand will skyrocket&#8230;.God save us if we vote to take his paltry few dollars and run. God save this country if that is truly the wave of the future. We will then have become a nation that makes nothing but hamburgers, creates nothing but lawyers, and sells nothing but tax shelters. And if we are at that point in this country, where we kill something because at the moment it&#8217;s worth more dead than alive, well, take a look around. Look at your neighbor. Look at your neighbor. You won&#8217;t kill him, will you? No. It&#8217;s called murder, and it&#8217;s illegal. Well, this, too, is murder, on a mass scale. Only on Wall Street, they call it maximizing shareholder value, and they call it legal. And they substitute dollar bills where a conscience should be. Damn it! A business is worth more than the price of its stock. It&#8217;s the place where we earn our living, where we meet our friends, dream our dreams. It is, in every sense, the very fabric that binds our society together. So let us now, at this meeting, say to every Garfield in the land, here, we build things, we don&#8217;t destroy them. Here, we care about more than the price of our stock. Here, we care about people. Thank you.”</p></blockquote>

<div>Unfortunately, the President appears to be debating parallel to the real debate.  Capitalist vs the rest of us.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/all-you-need-to-know-to-understand.html">Time to get engaged sir</a>.  </div>

<p>I watched then read President Obama&#8217;s interview on 60 Minutes.  The following is the most telling quote:</p>
<blockquote><div>PRESIDENT OBAMA: &#8230;And, you know, I can make some really good arguments defending the Democratic position, and there are gonna be some people who just don&#8217;t agree with me. And that&#8217;s okay. And then we&#8217;ve got to figure out a way to compromise.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Respectfully sir&#8230;Your job is not Debate Club.  I can make &#8220;good arguments&#8221; also.  But, I&#8217;m not the person with the pen.  You are.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is the second most telling quote:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>PRESIDENT OBAMA: &#8230;leadership isn&#8217;t just legislation.  That it&#8217;s a matter of persuading people. And giving them confidence and bringing them together. And setting a tone. And making an argument that people can understand.</div>

<div>Respectfully sir&#8230; You had 52.9% of the popular vote in 2008 along with 53.18% popular vote for the House and 51.3% for the Senate.   This latest election shows that people got the &#8220;tone&#8221;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Frankly sir, you need to legislate like you actually mean the &#8220;really good arguments defending the Democratic position&#8230;&#8221;  Otherwise sir, it&#8217;s just rhetoric.  It&#8217;s just Debate Club.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;You know&#8230;&#8221; you do actually hold as your convictions the &#8220;really good arguments defending the Democratic position&#8230;&#8221;?  </div>
