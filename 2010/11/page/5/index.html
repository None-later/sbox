                                <p>There is a lot of fanfare today about the success of GM to date as it turns around the bankruptcy of a couple years ago.  Let&#8217;s look at the nature of this success, which may offer voters  an insight into patterns of successful competition as it stands today.</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>So, what does the new GM look like? A few nuggets from the registration statement:
</p>
<ul>
<li>33 percent of its sales come from North America;</li>
<li>44.5 percent come from Asia-Pacific, South America, Russia, Eastern Europe, Africa and the Middle East, including a market-leading position in China;</li>
<li>43% of its vehicles are manufactured in regions of the world where the &#8220;all-in&#8221; labor cost is under $15 an hour;</li>
<li>Its U.S. pension plans remain underfunded by about $17.1 billion. </li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s wishing the new GM success.</p>

It is also related to concpts determining trade policies:</p>
<blockquote><p>None of these countries significantly increased the share of GDP going to government transfers. What happened is that some nations did more than others to pass the fruits of economic growth on to the poor.
</p>
<p>Trickle down via transfers occurs in various ways. In some countries pensions, unemployment compensation, and related benefits are indexed to average wages, so they tend to rise automatically as the economy grows. Increases in other transfers, such as social assistance, require periodic policy updates. The same is true of tax reductions for low-income households.</p>
<p>Should we bemoan the fact that employment and earnings aren’t the key trickle-down mechanism?</p>

<p>The game continues, as Republicans hold out for tax cuts for the wealthy (who are garnering increasing amounts of the total income) and various &#8220;deficit commissions&#8221; put out austerity plans that all call for cutting Social Security benefits and Medicare benefits.</p>
<p>Alice Rivlin, who spoke here at my campus some time ago, seemed clearly to have cutting Social Security and Medicare in mind even then.  See A<a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/04/alice-rivlin-on-financial-reform-and-deficits.html">lice Rivlin on Financial Reform and Deficits, ataxingmatter</a>.  She is now &#8220;trying to stir a debate&#8221; about a national sales tax, according to Bloomberg.  Przybyla, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-17/rivlin-proposes-6-5-national-sales-tax-as-part-of-deficit-reduction-plan.html">Rivlin Proposes 6.5% National Sales Tax as Part of Deficit-Reduction Plan</a>, Nov. 17, 2010.  See also Jackie Calmes, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/us/politics/17fiscal.html">New Deficit Reduction Plan from Bipartisan Group</a>, NY Times, Nov. 17, 2010.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now Rivlin is one of those Clintonites who is a right-center Democrat and, like so many of the Clinton and Obama advisers, close to the banking elite as a former Federal Reserve vice chairperson.  She claims her plan would be good for the country, but it isn&#8217;t so clear to me.  Growth for growth&#8217;s sake, we learn, doesn&#8217;t work very well.  Tax cuts for businesses don&#8217;t necessarily translate into US economic growth&#8211;they may just lead to higher executive compensation and bigger buybacks of shares for shareholders.  Tax cuts for the wealthy don&#8217;t lead to more jobs:  the claim that &#8220;small businesses&#8221; are helped when their owners aren&#8217;t forced to pay the piddling (for them) additional taxes that would be due if the Bush cuts for the wealthiest were not renewed is a farce&#8211;there are very few businesses that even fall into the wealthy owner category, and those businesses aren&#8217;t likely to invest a penny more in jobs just because their owners get even wealthier with bigger tax cuts.</p>
<p>The Rivlin plan is a combination of significant tax cuts (lowering corporate rates, even though corporations&#8217; effective tax rates are already at the international norm and perhaps lower if all is taken into account), freezing domestic spending (even though the unemployed, underemployed and vulnerable elderly and poor will need more support, not less, and even though infrastructure projects require additional funding and everything from education to food and drug inspection to disease control are already short-staffed); limit federal spending on health care for the elderly while raising Medicare premiums, eliminate most deductions and credits, cut the Social Security benefits (changing the cost-of-living adjustments and reducing growth in benefits for the top 25% of beneficiaries), give a one-year Social Security payroll tax holiday (aimed, I wager, to make Social Security look like it is insolvent and therefore in need of cuts and privatization), and add a national sales tax of 6.5% (terribly regressive).</p>
<p>The claim is that this combination of tax and spending cuts with the sales tax will increase economic growth and therefore create jobs.  I&#8217;m not convinced. </p>
<p>Even Bloomberg&#8217;s reporter recognizes that the real purpose of these sorts of trial balloons is to &#8220;paint[] an even starker picture of the measures needed to tame the debt&#8221; and thereby &#8220;sell unpopular remedies&#8221;.    Aha.  The real purpose for Rivlin&#8217;s new visibility is as the &#8220;bad cop&#8221; of the bad cop-good cop act that has as its goal to sell Americans on the need to end Social Security as we know it, to cut back on our societal commitment to provide decent medical care to the aged, and to carry out even more tax cuts for the benefit of our growing oligarchic class.  Yet the Social Security funds&#8211;paid in by workers and their employers&#8211;have been used to reduce the federal operating deficit for years, a process that was carred to extremes under Bush to fund the Bush tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.</p>

<p>Why doesn&#8217;t Rivlin just support changing the current funding mechanism for Social Security so that it will be a tax on 100% of wages and on capital gains, as is Medicare?  Why not support nonrenewal of the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans?  Why not support continued tightening of the corporate tax code, including restrictions on tax-free reorganizations that permit US multinationals to grow bigger and richer and more powerful (and too big to fail)?  Why not recognize that the deficit isn&#8217;t nearly as bad a problem as the increase in inequality in our country and the potential for an oligarchic takeover of our society? </p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t jobs the real need, whether or not we do something now or later to limit the deficit?  Shouldn&#8217;t we spend money to create jobs, if we have to?  Infrastructure and education are two public goods that the government can fund while at the same time creating jobs.  We can worry about the deficit later.  Or we can just decide not to renew any of the Bush tax cuts.  Nobody was clamoring for tax cuts when the Republicans pushed the first through in 2001, so let them go and we&#8217;ll all be back more or less where we were then.  We&#8217;ll manage.   If you don&#8217;t think so, look at this Tax Policy Center (Urban Institute/Brookings Institution) <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/General_Explanation_CL_CP.cfm">analysis of the impact of the expiration of the 2001-2003 Tax Cuts</a>.  Extending the cuts would result in an average effective tax rate reduction for all taxpayers of 2.7 percentage points (&#8220;current policy&#8221;) compared with letting them expire (&#8220;current law&#8221;).  Renewing the cuts gives the biggest cuts, both in dollar and percentage points, to the highest income taxpayers.</p>

<p>If raising taxes on the rich is not possible politically now and raising taxes on the middle class possibly hard on the recovery, then at least do nothing other than extend them for a year or two while the country gets back on its feet.  And then let them go, along with a repeal of the preferential rate for capital gains and the extension of Social Security to full income.  Problem solved, and people put back to work. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Republicans are intent on letting the deficit go wherever so long as they can get the tax cuts they want most&#8211;for the wealthiest taxpayers amongst us. See, e.g., MichaelTomasky&#8217;s Blog, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2010/nov/17/congress-useconomy-tax-battle-lines-drawn">Tax Battle Lines Drawn</a> (Nov. 17, 2010).   Camp, Republican from Michigan, says the GOP would be &#8220;foolish&#8221; to go along with any idea to renew tax cuts for 80% of Americans without giving a tax break to the wealthy at the same time.  Everybody knows that the GOP wants to make those Bush tax cuts that were designed to expire into permanent reductions in tax revenues.  See e.g. (but note my &#8220;caution&#8221; below),  <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=40011">Will Obama Extend the Bush Tax Cuts?</a>, Human Events (Nov. 16, 2010) (indicating that &#8220;Republicans said they are still determined to make all of the Bush tax cuts permanent, rejecting White House overtures to decouple the top rates for a shorter extension&#8221;).  And the biggest beneficiaries are the GOP&#8217;s primary backers&#8211;the wealthy and big business&#8211;not the jobless.  See, e.g., &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/16/AR2010111607468_pf.html">GOP to Jobless: Drop Dead</a>&#8220;, Washington Post (Nov. 16, 2010).</p>
<p>(<em>CAUTION</em>&#8211;the &#8220;human events&#8221; blog just cited is a right-wing propaganda sheet scattered with contextually faulty or otherwise typically misleading statements , such as claiming that the scheduled expiration of the Bush cuts &#8220;could plunge the economy into another recession&#8221; or quoting Michael Steele in saying that the Republicans are fighting to &#8220;permanently stop the Democrats&#8217; tax hikes&#8221; &#8211;even though, of course, the scheduled expiration of the Bush tax cuts was designed by the Republicans as a way to fool the people about the actual multi-trillion-dollar cost and if the expiration of the Bush cuts according to schedule is a tax hike (which I&#8217;d dispute), it is a Republican one and not a Democratic one). </p>
<p>Polls fairly consistently show that Americans think at least the cuts for the wealthy should expire and possibly the cuts for all of us.   A recent poll shows that about a third of Americans think we shouldn&#8217;t renew any of the tax cuts, and another third think that at least we shouldn&#8217;t renew the tax cuts on the wealthy&#8211;that means that there&#8217;s a 2-1 vote against renewing the tax cuts for the wealthy.   See Steinhauser, <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/09/14/do-americans-want-to-extend-tax-cuts-for-wealthy-2/">Do Americans Want to Extend Tax Cuts for the Wealthy?</a>, CNN Politics, Sept. 14, 2010.  As noted in that article, another poll  (Gallup/USA Today)showed 44% want to roll back the cuts for wealthy Americans and 15% want the cuts to expire for everybody (including wealthy Americans), so also a 2-1 vote against renewing tax cuts for the wealthy. </p>
<p>And rightly so.  Because there is no way that renewing the tax cuts will be a significant stimulus to the economy nor any way that failure to renew them will hurt &#8220;small businesses&#8221;.  See, e.g., Fisher, <a href="http://www.aolnews.com/opinion/article/the-economics-of-extending-bushs-tax-cuts/19577979">The Economics of Extending Bush&#8217;s Tax Cuts</a>.  On the other hand, not renewing the cuts for the wealthy would do wonders for the economy&#8211;it would give us about $800 billion over ten years, &#8220;enough to pay for all veterans&#8217; hospitals, doctors, and the rest of the Veterans Affairs health system, plus the United States Coast Guard, plus the Food and Drug Administration, plus the operation and maintenance of every single national park for the entire 10-year period&#8211;with more than $100 billion left over.&#8221; Id (quoting Michael linden at the Center for American Progress).</p>

                                <p>On Econbrowser last week: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2010/11/the_impact_of_h.html">The Impact of Health Insurance Reform in Massachusetts</a>
</p>
<blockquote><p>The use of emergency rooms for routine care fell, as did hospital admissions for treating preventable conditions, and the proportion of uninsured among hospital inpatients (by 36%), while there was no increase in the growth of hospital costs. From the <a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/nov10/w16012.html"><i>NBER Digest</i> article</a> summarizing <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w16012">NBER working paper 16012</a> <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/~ak669/w16012Oct10.pdf">[ungated version]</a> by <a href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/ldichi/JonathanKolstad.shtml">Jonathan T. Kolstad</a> and <a href="http://www.econ.yale.edu/faculty1/kowalski.htm">Amanda E. Kowalski</a>: <a name="more"></a> </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The national health care legislation passed in March 2010 requires U.S. citizens to obtain health insurance coverage. Modeled on legislation passed in Massachusetts in 2006, the new federal law contains many provisions that are similar to that state&#8217;s reform, including new requirements for employers and expansions in subsidized health insurance. </p>
<p>&#8230;Using hospital discharge data, they conclude that the Commonwealth&#8217;s health insurance reform reduced the number of uninsured among the inpatient hospital population by 36 percent. The reform increased coverage most among: young adults and the near elderly, men, people from the lowest-income zip codes, and people identified as black and Hispanic. </p>
<p>Insurance coverage through Medicaid, the state-run federal program designed for low-income people, expanded by approximately 30 percent among nonelderly residents of Massachusetts. &#8230;</p>
<p>Use of hospital emergency rooms for routine care also declined after 2006: the reform’s expanded insurance coverage resulted in a 2 percentage point decrease in the fraction of hospital admissions from the emergency room. The reduction in emergency admissions was particularly pronounced among people in low-income areas of the state. </p>
<p>Hospital admissions for treating preventable conditions also fell. The authors find a decrease of 2.7 percentage points in inpatient admissions attributable to preventable conditions. </p>
<p>The authors note that the Massachusetts mandate for individual insurance coverage widened access to outpatient treatment and thus management of preventable conditions. Despite finding other hospital impacts, this study finds no evidence that hospital cost growth increased following the reform.</p>

<p>Well it is out and I have a copy. And no doubt in short order it will be up at the following web-page: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/solvency/index.html but as of 10:43 AM PST it wasn&#8217;t. Because just like the SSA score of the Chairmen&#8217;s proposal there is a lag between release and web publication.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll extract some tables and publish them in a future post but the results are very similar to the Simpson-Bowles Plan with the bottom line being a 75 year improvement in actuarial balance of 2.48% in the face of a current imbalance of 2.01%, that is there is a certain amount of over-kill if the problem is considered simply as one of solvency. For now I will leave you with this simple graphic from the score.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TOQlX_79WDI/AAAAAAAAAbU/5VXK3ipbzOI/s1600/Rivlin-Domenici%2BTF%2BRatio.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TOQlX_79WDI/AAAAAAAAAbU/5VXK3ipbzOI/s400/Rivlin-Domenici%2BTF%2BRatio.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>

<p>In <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/11/economists-and-non-economists-behaving-very-badly-indeed-watch.html">Economists (and Non-Economists) Behaving Very Badly Indeed Watch</a>, Brad DeLong accosts the austerity bandwagon that objects to any more federal stimulus, whether from Congress or from the Fed.</p>
<p>At the moment our flow of nominal spending at $14.7 trillion per year is some 12% below its pre-2008 trend. And in the absence of any 12% decline in prices and wages, that shortfall in spending has to produce our current macroeconomic distress: there is not enough &#8220;money&#8221; to support enough of a flow of spending to chase all the goods we could produce. We don&#8217;t have a deficiency of real supply (for whatever reason). We have a deficiency of nominal demand.</p>

<p>This is the problem we all know and recognize.  Since the financial crisis hit, banks, corporations and individuals have been deleveraging, and that means not enough money is out there being spent.  The stimulus bill was a bare minimum that staved out utter depression, but (on Republican insistence) was larded with much too many tax breaks for big corporations rather than targeted 100% towards the population that would best put the money to work in the economy. Private saving means that public spending has to step into the gap.  We did some, but not enough.  Jobs were saved, but not enough new jobs were created.  Thus, the Fed has a new proposal for a $600 billion stimulus&#8211;quantitative easing (essentially, printing money rather than borrowing it).  This is a good idea, especially since we can expect either gridlock or Republican policies holding sway in Congress for the next two years, which means that the plight of ordinary Americans will take a back burner to ensuring the &#8220;competitiveness&#8221; (read&#8211;high profits) of US multinationals and cutting federal workers, federal benefits, Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>As DeLong notes, even a bunch of conservative economists of times gone by (including Milton Friedman) would say that &#8220;it is a central bank&#8217;s business to intervene in asset markets to boost the flow of nominal spending back to what everybody expected it to be and counted on it being.&#8221;</p>
<p>But today&#8217;s wingnuts can&#8217;t seem to stomach any reasonable policy that might help someone other than managers and owners of the US MNEs.  So DeLong notes:</p>
<p>now we have a bunch of economists and non-economists behaving very badly: saying not only that the government shouldn&#8217;t boost its spending but that the central bank shouldn&#8217;t buy bonds for cash either.</p>
<p>And they have no real model for how we got into this mess or how we can get out of it.  They pretend that the credit mess instigated by big banks was really the Fed&#8217;s fault (along with the community reinvestment act&#8211;operable for three decades, but nonetheless guilty according to the right and Fannie and Freddie, which came in at the tail end of the action but nonetheless are primary causes according to the right).  As Krugman (quoted in DeLong) says:</p>
<p>How do they think we got into a crisis that has depressed employment all around the advanced world? I don’t think they have an answer; I think all they have are wild stories about how Obama’s Sharia-law Marxism has unnerved business, or something, with the effects mysteriously spreading to Spain and Latvia.</p>
<p>And in the name of whatever it is they believe, they’re doing their best to ensure that the slump goes on.</p>
<p>One of DeLong&#8217;s commenters has it right, so we might as well end with an excerpt of that comment:</p>
<p>Apparently, [the right-wing, nihilist economists] are right because they say they are right, and they don&#8217;t need no stinking facts, models or studies to back their views up. BTW, didn&#8217;t we try their way during the Hoover administration and it didn&#8217;t work then?  Rob in Fl.</p>

<p>And by &#8216;framing&#8217; I mean as in Film Noir gangster movies rather than Lakoffian terms. (Apropos of nothing, Prof. Lakoff gave me the worst grade I ever got in college, but felt so bad about it I wanted to tell HIM to &#8216;buck up&#8217;. Long time ago.)</p>
<p>Peter Orszag has made quite a stir with a couple of Op-Eds this last weekend of which the most recent was <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/15/opinion/15orszag.html?_r=1">Safer Social Security</a> in which he cleverly indicts and then sentences Social Security with the following:<br />
<blockquote>Nevertheless, Social Security does face an actuarial deficit. Current projections suggest that, after 2037, benefits would need to be reduced by more than 20 percent to match revenue. Measured over the next 75 years, the deficit in Social Security is expected to amount to 0.7 percent of the economy — not a huge amount, but a deficit nonetheless.</p>
<p>So it would be desirable to put the system on sounder financial footing. And that is precisely what the co-chairmen of President Obama’s bipartisan commission on reducing the national debt have bravely proposed to do. It’s too bad their proposal has been greeted with so much criticism, especially from progressives — who really should look at it as an opportunity to fix Social Security without privatizing it. Although the plan leans too much on future benefit reductions and not enough on revenue increases, it still offers a good starting point for reform.</p></blockquote>
<p> Well this is going to take a whole lot of unpacking, and the only question is where to start. And a prosaic answer is &#8216;Under the fold&#8217;.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Orszag&#8217;s first move is to point out that Social Security faces an actuarial defict and defines the effect of that in terms of a &#8216;more than 20 percent&#8217; cut after 2037, and then proceeds to quantify that cut as an actuarial gap of 0.7% of the economy. Already he is having things two ways. Lets say we adopted a plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; in the face of &#8216;Crisis&#8217;, what would be the result on that actuarial gap? Well one answer is that the accumulated Social Security Trust Funds would be drawn down to  depletion, which if nothing was done in response would require a 22% cut from the scheduled benefit. Now whether this cut actually even represents a &#8216;Crisis&#8217; depends on your reaction to what I call &#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217;. Under the current schedule real benefits as measured in terms of a basket of good are set to grow by 100% over the seventy five year projection and account for a full 45% of program growth over that period, which can be seen in graphic form via this 2003 CBO Report <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4380&#038;type=0">The Future Growth of Social Security: It&#8217;s Not Just Society&#8217;s Aging</a>. This growth in real benefits is such that even a 22% cut on Trust Fund depletion in 2037 would still result in a better real result for the retiree of 2038 with Rosser&#8217;s Equation yielding something close to &#8216;78% of 160% =125%&#8217;, in this context &#8216;Crisis&#8217; means &#8216;25% better real check than my Mom gets today&#8217;. Which should pose two questions: one to the hardline deficit guy of &#8216;Well then Who Cares?&#8217; and another to the New Dealer &#8216;How do we close the gap?&#8217;.</p>
<p>Taking the hardliner first. In his world Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; takes two forms. The one cited most often is the actuarial gap between scheduled and payable benefits over the 75 year and Infinite Future Horizon, that is what it would cost to appease that New Dealer and deliver 100% of the schedule. And those numbers are expressed in three ways in the following Table from the 2010 Report: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/IV_LRest.html#267528">Table IV.B6.—Unfunded OASDI Obligations for 1935 (Program Inception) Through the Infinite Horizon,</a> If we take as SS critics like to do the Infinite Future numbers we see a gap of $16.1 trillion which equates to 3.3% of payroll and 1.2% of GDP, or if we use the more traditional 75 year window we get corresponding numbers of $5.4 trillion, 1.8% of payroll (2.01% if you add in the requirement for a 100% reserve), and 0.6% of GDP. But what critics, and including Orszag here, glide over is that a policy of &#8216;Nothing&#8217;, if strictly adhered to resets all those numbers to zero at Trust Fund Depletion, the benefit cut itself wiping out that &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217;. Because the so-called &#8216;Unfunded Liability&#8217; is not in a legal sense a liability at all, Congress can and has changed both tax and benefit levels to raise or lower that &#8216;liability&#8217; and can effectively eliminate it altogether by simply doing &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. Meaning that critics can present either the 22% percent cut or that 0.6% GDP gap as being the definition of crisis but putting them both forward at the same time is just dishonest. Because the cut in and of itself eliminates the gap.</p>
<p>So a policy of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; projects the following result: 100% of the scheduled benefit payable until 2037 with retirees in that year getting a roughly 60% better check than today, and then if the economic projections are correct (a big if) then a cut to a Pay-Go status in 2038 that would have initial benefits only 25% better than today and then a continued (if slower) growth in real terms from then on. How does this result remotely add up to crisis for the hardliners? Well it is a mostly unstated political calculation, they believe that when push comes to shove that then current retirees will demand that the full schedule be paid ANYWAY, no matter what the consequences. So what is the &#8216;brave&#8217; answer to this future political showdown? Convince workers that &#8216;crisis&#8217; doesn&#8217;t mean &#8216;25% better real check&#8217; but instead &#8216;no check for me&#8217; and so accept a phased in benefit cut that STILL ends up with most workers getting a worse deal than plain &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. And especially those workers who will have spent most of their projected retirement already by 2037. The SSA Office of the Chief Actuary scored the ultimate effects of Simpson-Bowles as a percentage of scheduled and payable (i.e. after cut) benefits at various income levels, which scores were mostly extracted in the following post here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/more-from-ssa-on-simpson-bowles-plans.html">More From SSA on Simpson-Bowles</a>. And the results show that everyone in the top 60-70% of lifetime wage earnings comes out a loser, first  taking initially small cuts from the schedule starting in 2010 that by 2037 have the &#8216;High&#8217; and &#8216;Maximum&#8217; earners taking the same cut by 2040 as &#8216;Nothing&#8217; would enroute to a 35% or 41% cut compared to the schedule respectively by 2080.</p>
<p>Now why does Orszag insist that progressives should accept this cut for the majority of beneficiaries as the starting point for compromise? Because it isn&#8217;t privatization. Oh boy, oh joy we get to trade slow bleeding for amputation! Instead of say going for a complete cure.</p>
<p>Now that we know what result &#8216;Nothing&#8217; would deliver for the typical beneficiary, that is a 25% better basket of real goods even after the reset, what would be the cost of a &#8216;Something&#8217; that would actually deliver 100% of the schedule or a 60% better basket? Orszag and friends won&#8217;t even allow you to go there, by methods fair and foul they  have prevented open discussion of what  in real terms a revenue based solution would mean, and in particular any revenue based solution starting from across the board payroll tax increases. The unstated implication is that such solutions would be too costly for the average worker for the benefits accrued, but despite a lot of talk about &#8216;all options being on the table&#8217; this one is not offered even in expectation of it being rejected. Because odds are it wouldn&#8217;t be, in comparison to the drastic cuts presented as an alternative the needed tax increases would be a flea bite.</p>
<p>CBO recently scored 30 different policy options to address the projected 0.6% of GDP gap between scheduled and payable benefits in a Report linked from and with key graphic reproduced in this AB post <a target="_blank' href=" http:>CBO Scores Social Security Policy Options</a>. Now a lot of progressives insist the answer is easy: &#8220;Lift the cap&#8221; and depending on how you lift the cap and whether you allow that increase to come with a commensurate better benefit you can fix or even more than fix the gap via that route, see Options 4 and 6. On the other hand the Option closest to the Obama campaign proposal of taxing wages over $250k at 2-6% which is no 9 only closes 1/6th of the gap. But some of the traditional SS defenders at AB think this is largely the wrong way to go, in large part because the cap has serious political and philosophical advantages in keeping Social Security a worker funded retirement system rather than a welfare system. Now Dale, Arne and me are currently on record with the NorthWest Plan which is close to Option 2 which CBO does score as backfilling the entire gap, but I would be perfectly happy with a combination of Options 3 (raise FICA 0.05% a year for 60 years) and 5 (gradually restore taxable maximum to the traditional 90% of wage income level) which disregarding possible interaction add up to a 0.7% of GDP fix to the 0.6% projected problem (CBO) or 0.7% one (SSA) and allows for adjustments in the out years.</p>
<p>But for Orszag embracing a fix in perfectly alignment with most past adjustments and maintaining the traditional balance and structure of Social Security is just us sailing up some river in Egypt, in our stubbornness unwilling to admit the &#8216;bravery&#8217; of Simpson and Bowles where that bravery involves bleeding away retirement security for the middle class while giving the truly wealthy of free pass. Well sorry, until &#8216;compromise&#8217; is defined as putting the FULL RANGE of possible solutions on the Table and engaging in a numerically honest discussion of the tradeoffs, I am inclined to ignore Peter Orszag and instead listen to the long-time champion of Social Security, Dean Baker of CEPR:<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/action-on-social-security-the-urgent-need-for-delay">Action on Social Security: the Urgent Need for Delay</a> whose advice starts:<br />
<blockquote>There is enormous public confusion (much of it deliberately cultivated) about the extent of Social Security’s projected shortfall. Many policymakers and analysts point out that projections from the Congressional Budget Office and the Social Security Trustees show the program to be out of balance in the long-term, therefore we would be best advised to make changes as soon as possible. This paper argues that supporters of the existing Social Security system should try to ensure that no major changes to the core program are implemented in the immediate future. It points out that:<br />1) There is good reason for believing that the public will be better informed about the financial state of Social Security in the future, in part because of the weakening of some of the main sources of misinformation;<br />2) Many more people will be directly dependent on Social Security in the near future. These people and their families will likely be strong defenders of the program;<br />3) The group of near-retirees, who may be the victims of early action, will desperately need their Social Security since they have seen much of their wealth eliminated with the collapse of the housing bubble; and<br />4) The concern over “maintaining the confidence of financial markets” is an empty claim that can be used to justify almost any policy.</p></blockquote>
<p> Consider this post my little attempt to help out on bullet point one. &#8216;Nothing&#8217;-STILL the numerically proven plan since 1997.</p>

<p><strong>Extrapolated September 2010 Debt, by President</strong></p>
<p>Cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=222">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>This one is quick and dirty because I&#8217;m very low on time&#8230;. Anyhow, these days there&#8217;s a lot of talk about the debt, and some talk about how irresponsible Obama is, or maybe its GW. Who knows, there&#8217;s a lotta talk and very little hard facts, much less context. So, from working on Presimetrics, I had some debt data lying around and started with that.</p>
<p>The table below shows the total national debt and ending national debt for each President for December of the year before he took office and the growth rate over that time period. For grins I threw in the President&#8217;s extrapolated September 2010 debt. That was computed by taking the debt in December (in September 2010 dollars) of each President&#8217;s last year in office, and, assuming the rate at which debt had increased during his term would continue all the way to September 2010.</p>
<p>All data is in September 2010 dollars.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Figure-11.bmp"><img title="Figure 1" alt="" src="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Figure-11.bmp"></a></p>
<p><strong>To interpret</strong>:<br /><a name="more"></a><br />In December 1980, a month before Reagan took office, the debt was 2.354 trillion (Sept 2010 dollars). A month before he left office, in December 1988, that debt had increased to 4.866 trillion, which is an annualized growth rate of 9.50% a year. Starting with 4.866 trillion in December of 1988, and increasing at a rate of 9.50% a year would give you 35 trillion and change by September of 2010.</p>
<p>A few things to note&#8230; the two Presidents who added to the debt at the quickest rate were GW in first place and Reagan in second. They were followed by Ford, and then Obama, with GHW Bush not far behind. Now, I&#8217;ve been pretty critical of Obama for continuing GW&#8217;s policies (see Presimetrics, the book I wrote with Michael Kanell, and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/12/obama-bush-mankiw-look-taxes-spending.html">this</a>) but all in all, as lousy as he&#8217;s been, he&#8217;s far, far from the worst perpetrator when it comes to fiscal irresponsibility. (And please, spare me the whole &#8220;the banks needed saving&#8221; when so did many businesses and households&#8230; which weren&#8217;t saved. I&#8217;d be less inclined to carp if the money was spent on keeping Main Street afloat rather than seeing so much flow to Wall Street.) I wonder how the Tea Partiers would react to that information, and whether they are are angrier at GW and Reagan than they are at Obama. Somehow I doubt it.</p>
