                                <p>Discussion point:  Is it time for the Fed to start contracting its&#8217; balance sheet and otherwise withdrawing the special financing it provided while it was faced with the zero interest rate bound<br />and preparing to soon raise fed funds.</p>
<p>My fed policy index says the zero bound should no longer apply and that it is time for the fed to start preparing to soon raise fed funds.</p>

The biggest difference is that my index gives inflation and unemployment equal weight while the standard Taylor Rule gives inflation double the weight of the various measures of excess capacity.</p>

                                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/21/091221fa_fact_osnos"> The New Yorker</a> gives us a small look into policy in china other than the currency peg:<br />
<blockquote>The Problem Statement</p>
<p>U.S. manufacturing’s competitive status is increasingly challenged by other economies. Established industrialized nations such as Japan, Germany, Korea and Taiwan are developing state-of-the-art technologies, which range across all areas of manufacturing from electronics to discrete parts. Products based on technologies that originated in the U.S. economy, such as semiconductors and robotics, are increasingly both developed and produced elsewhere. </p>
<p>Emerging economies, such as China, are acquiring manufacturing capability through modest R&#038;D intensities, tax and other incentives for foreign direct investment, and intellectual property theft. This second group then competes through low-cost labor and the use of exchange rate manipulation along with tariff and non-tariff barriers.</p>
<p>However, emerging technology-based economies have the long-term goal of attaining world-class status as innovators, which means they are not content to operate at the low-technology, labor-intensive portion of manufacturing. China already is producing 30,000 patents annually and its patent application rate trails only the United States and Japan.1 Finally, event the huge U.S. lead in biopharmaceuticals is now under attack, as an increasing number of economies invest in supporting science and technology infrastructures and provide financial incentives for foreign direct investment in this rapidly expanding technology.</p>
<p>The combined long-term impact on the U.S. economy of investments by both established and newly industrialized economies has been the offshoring of substantial portions of U.S. manufacturing supply chains—first the labor-intensive industries but now the high-tech ones, as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>In the years that followed, the government pumped billions of dollars into labs and universities and enterprises, on projects ranging from cloning to underwater robots. Then, in 2001, Chinese officials abruptly expanded one program in particular: energy technology. The reasons were clear. Once the largest oil exporter in East Asia, China was now adding more than two thousand cars a day and importing millions of barrels; its energy security hinged on a flotilla of tankers stretched across distant seas. Meanwhile, China was getting nearly eighty per cent of its electricity from coal, which was rendering the air in much of the country unbreathable and hastening climate changes that could undermine China’s future stability. Rising sea levels were on pace to create more refugees in China than in any other country, even Bangladesh. </p>
<p>In 2006, Chinese leaders redoubled their commitment to new energy technology; they boosted funding for research and set targets for installing wind turbines, solar panels, hydroelectric dams, and other renewable sources of energy that were higher than goals in the United States. China doubled its wind-power capacity that year, then doubled it again the next year, and the year after. The country had virtually no solar industry in 2003; five years later, it was manufacturing more solar cells than any other country, winning customers from foreign companies that had invented the technology in the first place. As President Hu Jintao, a political heir of Deng Xiaoping, put it in October of this year, China must “seize preëmptive opportunities in the new round of the global energy revolution.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A China born again green can be hard to imagine, especially for people who live here. After four years in Beijing, I’ve learned how to gauge the pollution before I open the curtains; by dawn on the smoggiest days, the lungs ache. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>David Sandalow, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Energy for Policy and International Affairs, has been to China five times in five months. He told me, “China’s investment in clean energy is extraordinary.” For America, he added, the implication is clear: “Unless the U.S. makes investments, we are not competitive in the clean-tech sector in the years and decades to come.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>China is already buying and installing the world’s most efficient transmission lines—“an area where China has actually moved ahead of the U.S.,” according to Deborah Seligsohn, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. In the next decade, China plans to install wind-power equipment capable of generating nearly five times the power of the Three Gorges Dam, the world’s largest producer.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The prospect of a future powered by the sun and the wind is so appealing that it obscures a less charming fact: coal is going nowhere soon. Even the most optimistic forecasts agree that China and the United States, for the foreseeable future, will remain ravenous consumers. (China burns more coal than America, Europe, and Japan combined.) As Julio Friedmann, an energy expert at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, near San Francisco, told me, “The decisions that China and the U.S. make in the next five years in the coal sector will determine the future of this century.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>When Albert Lin, an American energy entrepreneur on the board of Future Fuels, a Texas-based power-plant developer, set out to find a gasifier for a pioneering new plant that is designed to spew less greenhouse gas, he figured that he would buy one from G.E. or Shell. Then his engineers tested the Xi’an version. It was “the absolute best we’ve seen,” Lin told me. (Lin said that the “secret sauce” in the Chinese design is a clever bit of engineering that recycles the heat created by the gasifier to convert yet more coal into gas.) His company licensed the Chinese design, marking one of the first instances of Chinese coal technology’s coming to America. “Fifteen or twenty years ago, anyone you asked would have said that Western technologies in coal gasification were superior to anything in China,” Lin said. “Now, I think, that claim is not true.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Obama Administration is busy repairing the energy legacy of its predecessor. The stimulus package passed in February put more than thirty-eight billion dollars into the Department of Energy for renewable-energy projects—including four hundred million for ARPA-E, the agency that Bush opposed. (It also allocated a billion dollars toward reviving FutureGen, though a final decision is pending.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Congress thinks by analogy</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember what link I followed to get to <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/business/jan-june10/makingsense_02-05.html">this</a>, but never in my life did I expect to agree 100% on any issue with David Stockman.  Yes, that David Stockman.  Holy wow:</p>
<blockquote><p>DAVID STOCKMAN: Credit default swaps, OK? And we weren&#8217;t bailing out AIG. We were bailing out the banks, because the banks had bought a lot of low-caliber or subprime loans, wrapped some insurance around it from AIG, and said, presto, we have a AAA, a security on our balance sheet. <br />They didn&#8217;t. They had garbage on their balance sheet. And the bailout was to make sure that they didn&#8217;t suffer multi $10 billion write-downs on that AIG-supported loan.</p>
<p>PAUL SOLMAN: So, if you had been in the administration after Lehman Brothers, you wouldn&#8217;t have supported bailing out AIG?</p>
<p>DAVID STOCKMAN: No, absolutely not. It was the single most, you know, drastic error in policy in modern history, going back to the 1930s. This was exactly the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s destroyed any basis for fiscal discipline in the United States. I was a member of Congress, and I know how they think. And they think by analogy. If you did it for John, you have got to do it for Bob. There is no way that any congressman is ever going to vote against farm subsidies or ethanol subsidies or housing subsidies or anything else, refrigerator subsidies, once we have made this tremendous bailout for Wall Street, and we stepped into AIG.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShWTahfDs5I/AAAAAAAAAOU/b9o84WPcj7c/s1600-h/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/ShWTahfDs5I/AAAAAAAAAOU/b9o84WPcj7c/s400/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This figure shows graphically the outcomes for the OAS (black line) and DI (gray line) under the three alternative scenarios Low Cost (I), Intermediate Cost (II), and High Cost (III) in the 2008 Report. Almost universally reporting on Social Security revolves around Intermediate Cost and if we examine its lines we see the standard reported outcomes, the DI Trust Fund going to depletion in 2023 and OAS in 2041. But that was then, the 2009 Report shortened up the intervals to 2017 and 2037 for Intermediate Cost, and the 2010 Report is certainly going to see DI in a state of near term collapse. Okay Intermediate Cost shows us a program in need of some fixes, immediately for DI, and in the medium term for OAS. Familiar story.</p>
<p>And High Cost tells the same story, only more so.</p>
<p>But Low Cost is different. Under Low Cost Social Security OASI is projected to be fully funded through the 75 year window and even have balances growing faster than costs after 2050 and Trust Fund Ratios never falling below 350. Would this be a good outcome. Well the fully funded part is nice, and a more or less flat tail after 2050 is nice, but a constant TF ratio above 350? Well no that is not a good thing, and the only thing worse would have Low Cost OAS look like Low Cost DI and rocketing through a TF ratio of 1000 on way to 2000. There is a point where the Trust Fund is literally too big for Social Security&#8217;s good. To understand why follow me below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />What would be the ideal shape and level for this graph. Well in shape it would look like Low Cost OAS, a near term bulge to build the TF to the point that interest on it meets the challenge pending from 2026 to 2050, and then flattening out. But at a lower level. This spreadsheet represents the NW Plan http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=r49_nOHQG4QdHuwcbMGmP0Q The column fourth from the Right is labeled Trust Fund Ratio and if graphed would show a perfect shape, a Trust Fund topping out with a ratio of 375 and then gradually adjusting down to ultimate levels between 123 and 130. But not that the total Trust Fund Balance only goes down during a ten year period and then by not enough to matter, under the NW Plan the principal in the Trust Fund never gets paid back. And that is a good thing.</p>
<p>So when supporters of Social Security claim that the tax increases starting in 1983 were designed to pre-pay Boomer Retirement they are right in spirit but wrong as to detail, in an ideally balance system those dollars are never called on directly. And by that same token it is wrong to say the Trust Fund was designed to run out, because it wasn&#8217;t, instead the expectation was that changes to either revenue or benefits would be made in a way that keeps that tail from dropping below 100. Meaning that the Trust Fund simply serves as a buffer for bad times, as it was between 1972 and real crisis in 1982 and as it is doing today.</p>
<p>But even given that a TF ratio of 100 is a designated minimum why is a flat 130 better than say the flat 400 seen under Low Cost OASI? Well because of the effort needed to keep a TF ratio flat. A flat TF ratio assumes that Benefits are requiring enough resources above FICA and Tax on Benefits to take up enough of Interest so that the TF grows only enough to mirror overall program growth. So if we assume ultimate interest earnings at 4% keeping a TF level steady at 400 reguires that some 12-15% of total program costs be paid by General Fund transfers and this over and above the 12.4% of payroll directly devoted to it. Which sets up three potentially contending groups. First you have beneficiaries who have an equitable claim that the Trust Fund is collectively an earned obligation to retired participants, even though most of the principal was actually contributed by previous generations. Second you have non-participants, particularly those with income from capital, who point out legitimately enough that they are picking up to 15% of program costs and getting nothing for it. In between you have current workers who are in effect paying twice, once in FICA and a second time in income taxes.</p>
<p>In contrast maintaining a TF ratio of 130 requires much less societal strain. Rather than an 85/15 split between payroll tax &#038; tax on benefits/debt service the split is 95/5 where that 5% is simply the cost of recession insurance.</p>
<p>Now some Social Democrats would claim that not only is 85/15 okay but they would take that to 50/50 or even 0/100. Well right on brothers and sisters! But quite apart from genuine philosophical beliefs in the virtues of thrift and self-reliance there are many practical and political strengths to having worker retirement financed by workers supplemented only by a small amount of interest on a reserve fund that prevents every downturn in employment from turning into outright class war. Instead Social Democrats could turn their attention to other societal goals like health care, paid leave, real wage increases, public education all of which directly or indirectly contribute to the general welfare, including that of wage workers.</p>
<p>Personally I would be okay with a ratio as high as 85/15 if that was driven simply by interest on an existing Trust Fund. Because once established a TF ratio of 400 is hard to drive down, the only way to do that is to artificially drive the second term up enough to actually start redeeming principal which in turn forces the whole system more in the direction of subsidized welfare. But levels much above 400 are actively dangerous.</p>
<p>If we return to the graph we see that Low Cost DI shoots up to a TF ratio of 2000 within the 75 year planning period. Under that scenario and at  assumed 5% the Trust Fund would be throwing off interest equal to program costs. This would have the effect of changing a worker financed &#8216;entitlement&#8217; program into a pure welfare program that increasingly would be justified simply on the basis of past contributions by past generations, at some point the concept of this being an earned benefit being totally lost. Now in the particular case of Disability this would not bother me much, I have no problem sticking a big part of the societal bill onto capitalists who may have created the conditions that led to that disability to start with, and besides I think the overall duty of society to aid the helpless is pretty clear to start with. But on purely practical and political grounds I would not like to see OAS going anywhere near the 1000 level, they system loses its insulation.</p>
<p>Which gets me back to my title. Social Security is under current assault under the belief that costs to finance payment of the interest owed are already too high. When pressed those opponents tend to reluctantly admit that they owe the money, it is just that it would societally harmful to do so. While I could and do argue that this is just nonsensical special pleading that the transfers at point of the greatest projected strain are no more than those of wars of choice, in the end the cost of paying down a $5 trillion debt is big while the projected cost a paying down a $2.5 trillion dollar debt is with subsequent interest effects less than half as high. Freezing the Trust Fund at its current levels would eliminate, at least it seems to me, this argument that not repaying the TF is not driven from ill-will but instead from practicality. Not that I believed in the argument to start with, just that I recognize its power. Hence my suggestion of a short term cut in FICA taxes sufficient to freeze the fund combined with a schedule of future increases to stabilize it.</p>
<p>Interestingly it looks like the economy is kind of doing my job for me. Under my formulation a vanishing Social Security surplus is not necessarily a bad thing, though certain that which is driving it, high unemployment, certainly is. Opponents are using this period of short term crisis to make long term changes to Social Security&#8217;s benefit formula, changes which ultimately worsen the situation by swelling the Trust Fund over the medium term. If we can just stave that off Social Security might emerge from this job recession actually better situated to achieve long-term health, freed from the burden of a burgeoning Trust Fund going forward.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/jan/21/obama-bank-reform-glass-steagall">Obama takes on America&#8217;s banks with new Glass-Steagall act</a>, Guardian.co.uk, Jan. 21, 2010</p>
<blockquote><p>President Obama came out in support of the &#8220;Volcker rule&#8221; intended to stop depositary banks from running hedge funds and using their money to bet on the markets.  I particularly like the part that recognizes that allowing banks to merge into bigger and bigger consolidated enterprises is not likely to be in the public interest.  (I&#8217;ve actually proposed we severely restrict tax-free reorganizations generally.)   About time that Obama stood for something stronger than &#8220;oh, let&#8217;s limit leverage a little bit&#8221; on the big banks.  It will take a significant package with significant changes to make a difference to the amount of risk in the financial system, but looks like Congress has already decided it doesn&#8217;t want to touch the Volker rule with a ten-foot pole.  Or at least, the people in Congress that need to move something through.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Then there&#8217;s Chris Dodd, about whom there have been on-again, off again indications of his support, nonsupport for the Volcker rule.  Dodd  now says he&#8217;s supportive, but worries about his compromise negotiations on banking reform.  I&#8217;m worried about those too&#8211;that they will be far from the bold steps that need to be taken to get this issue under control.  Breaking up big banks&#8211;not just protecting deposit banks&#8211;is probably a step that needs to be taken.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>&#8220;What we don&#8217;t want is internal hedge funds to be leveraging up and gambling using money that comes with a safety net for preventing devastating bank runs that is provided by taxpayers&#8230;.putting up &#8216;walls&#8217; to silo off these idfferent functions within one company won&#8217;t help us&#8211;we actually need to spin these functions out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/02/goldman-morgan-stanley-can-escape-volcker-rule.html">Yves Smith, naked capitalism, Goldman, Morgan Stanley Can Escape Volcker Rule</a> (Feb. 2, 2010)</p>
<blockquote><p>Yves isn&#8217;t very supportive of the Volcker Rule, because it fails to acknowledge that it is the systemic risk in the capital markets, more than worries about bank runs, that led the Fed to support Goldman, AIG and other Big Banks, forcing mergers of Bear Sterns and Merrill, letting Lehman fail and nearly causing a collapse.  The credit default swaps and repo markets were the center of the problem.   And while I tend to think there are nonetheless quite a few good reasons to reinstate some boundaries for banking and size-control mechanisms in addition to the puny leverage control mechanisms that were under discussion, she&#8217;s absolutely correct that it&#8217;s that federal guarantee, now extended to support investment bankings&#8217; casino gambling in the capital markets, that is the knot we have to unwind if there is any hope to avoid future taxpayer bailouts of investment bank profits.</p></blockquote>

<p>AN IMMODEST PROPOSAL</p>
<p>Bruce Webb offered a modest proposal in a recent post to &#8220;fix&#8221; the Social Security &#8220;problem&#8221; by (essentially) cutting the payroll tax a few tenths of a percent to reduce the surplus and thereby reduce the debt by that much money borrowed from and owed TO Social Security.</p>
<p>What is wrong with Bruce&#8217;s proposal is that it takes more intelligence to understand than most people can bring to bear on the question, and would require more honesty from Congress than they have shown in two hundred years.</p>
<p>So here is an alternate proposal more suited to the intelligence and honesty of the times:</p>
<p>RAISE the payroll tax one tenth of one percent this year, and again next year, and the year after.  This would be, from some perspectives, slightly unfair to the workers who pay the tax&#8230; but not a huge amount of money&#8230; and it would increase the national debt.  But it would give congress some extra money to play with to spend on submarines and other things we need to win the war on terror.  And it would put Social Security into long term actuarial solvency beyond any question or doubt.</p>
<p>And that would make the extra cost worthwhile to the workers. They would have their Social Security guaranteed, and that guarantee is worth more than a few bucks a week.</p>
<p>What the Congress would do with the rising debt is anybody&#8217;s question.  But it is not a question that ever troubled them in the past,  when the enemies of Social Security weren&#8217;t using &#8220;the looming crisis in Social Security&#8221; as an argument for killing the workers ability to save for their own retirement.</p>
<p>Oh, the limit of the payroll tax increase proposed here would be a 2% increase for the worker and for his employer.  Phased in over twenty years, it wouldn&#8217;t hurt.  And it really would go to pay for the eventual retirement of the workers paying the tax.  Congress would never have to pay back the money in the trust fund, so that shouldn&#8217;t worry them.  Unless the sight of those phony iou&#8217;s climbing into the stratosphere made them nervous.<br />_________________________<br />by Dale Coberly</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/roubinis-not-wrong-but.html">Many months ago</a>, I quoted the brilliant <a href="http://www.tavakolistructuredfinance.com/index.html">Janet Tavakoli</a>&#8216;s book <a href="http://www.booksamillion.com/product/9780471412663?id=4214424925428">Credit Derivatives and Synthetic Structures</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The trader then went on to tell me that Commercial Bank of Korea would sell credit default protection on bonds issued by the Commercial Bank of Korea.<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s very interesting,&#8221; I countered, &#8220;but the credit default option is worthless.&#8221;<br />&#8220;But people are doing it,&#8221; persisted the trader.<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; I affirmed. &#8220;The correlation between Commercial Bank of Korea and itself is 100 percent. I would pay nothing for that credit protection. It is worthless for this purpose.&#8221;<br />The trader mustered his best grammar, chilliest tone, and most authoritative voice: &#8220;There are those who would disagree with you.&#8221; (p. 85)</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently, that anonymous trader—or another <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2008/06/vikram.html">money-losing risk-mispricing hedge fund manager</a>—is <a href="http://www.risk.net/risk-magazine/news/1590861/citi-plans-crisis-derivatives">now running The Big C</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Credit specialists at Citi are considering launching the first derivatives intended to pay out in the event of a financial crisis. The firm has drawn up plans for a tradable liquidity index, known as the CLX, on which products could be structured that allow buyers to hedge a spike in funding costs&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great thing about the index is that it hedges your funding costs while being very simple to trade. I believe it will reduce the systemic risk in the industry, akin to how the advent of swaps means people don&#8217;t worry about interest-rate exposures any more – they just pay a fee to hedge it,&#8221; he says.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because if funding dries up, The Big C will be there to support you!</p>
<p>I thought this was an attempt to make money on a premium, but it isn&#8217;t:<br />
<blockquote>Like a swap, the contracts envisaged by Citi would be entered into without an up-front premium, with money changing hands according to the index&#8217;s movements around a fair strike value.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the model is actually that you pay a higher cost of funds during good times, and during bad times, depend on the ability of your counterparty to make you whole.</p>
<p>When banks do it, it&#8217;s called &#8220;deposit insurance,&#8221; and it is valuable because in the worst-case scenario, the U.S. Treasury can print money. Since—the last time I checked—Citigroup cannot do that, the option is as valuable as the ability of the bank to perform in a crisis.  How did that work out last time?</p>

<p>Yes, the renminbi (RMB) is closer to fair value. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman <a href="http://www.gov.cn/misc/2010-02/04/content_1528495.htm">Ma Zhaoxu states</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Our currency, the RMB, has appreciated more than 20 percent against the U.S. dollar since July 2005, when China moved to a floating exchange rate regime,&#8221; Ma said. Before 2005, the RMB was pegged to the U.S. dollar at a fixed rate.</p>
<p>&#8220;The RMB exchange rate has drawn close to a reasonable and balanced level, given the international balance of payments and the market supply and demand for foreign exchange,&#8221; Ma said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/05/world/asia/05diplo.html">New York Times</a> asserts that China&#8217;s currency is undervalued by 25%-40%. The NY Times, like many politicians and media channels, is entirely too obsessed with China&#8217;s exchange rate; they fail to understand that economic fundamentals are changing.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, the level of the renminbi has become rather inconsequential to Chinese trade flows. Why? Because despite the fact that the renminbi has been pegged against the dollar since July of 2008, imports are surging.<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S23mU4w6ezI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/3b3rcLtgI5I/s1600-h/trade_trends.png"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S23mU4w6ezI/AAAAAAAAC1Q/3b3rcLtgI5I/s320/trade_trends.png"></a>The chart above illustrates the 3-month annualized growth rate in exports and imports and the renminbi valued against the US dollar. I use the 3-month annualized rate, rather than the year/year rate, to remove the strong base effects from the drop-off in trade last year.<br /><!-- more --><br />The first thing to notice is that while export growth is indeed strong, &#8220;business as usual&#8221; in China, import growth is surely breaking trend. The 3-month annualized growth rate of imports &#8211; a good proxy for domestic demand &#8211; averaged 117% annualized growth per month from April (when it turned positive) to December 2009. Compared to this period in 2006, annualized import growth is up almost 80 percentage-points, while that for exports is up just 5 percentage-points (76.2% average 3-month annualized growth in exports May-December 2009 vs. 71.7% in 2006).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to argue that the Chinese currency is so &#8220;undervalued&#8221; if the import response is this strong.</p>
<p>Another myth is that China is running large current account surpluses. Given the chart above, it won&#8217;t surprise you to know that China&#8217;s current account has dropped markedly since late 2008.</p>

Therefore, the renminbi, by definition, is closer to whatever an equilibrium would be, despite the fact that it is fixed. Thus, like <a href="http://www.gov.cn/misc/2010-02/04/content_1528495.htm">Ma Zhaoxu</a> says, it&#8217;s at a &#8220;reasonable&#8221; value.</p>
