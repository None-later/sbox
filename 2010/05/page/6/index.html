<p>Alex Tabarrok wrote </p>
<blockquote><p>In Too Big To Save Robert Pozen gives a clever example, based on an excellent paper by Coval, Jurek and Stafford, which explains both the lure of structured finance and why the model exploded so quickly.</p>
<p>Suppose we have 100 mortgages that pay $1 or $0.  The probability of default is 0.05.  We pool the mortgages and then prioritize them into tranches such that tranche 1 pays out $1 if no mortgage defaults and $0 otherwise, tranche 2 pays out $1 if 1 or fewer mortgages defaults, $0 otherwise.  Tranche 10 then pays out $1 if 9 or fewer mortgages default and $0 otherwise.  Tranche 10 has a probability of defaulting of 2.82 percent.  A fortiori tranches 11 and higher all have lower probabilities of defaulting.  Thus, we have transformed 100 securities each with a default of 5% into 9 with probabilities of default greater than 5% and 91 with probabilities of default less than 5%.</p></blockquote>
<p>The quoted claim is false. I explain why after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In his post, Tabarrok assumes that the correlation between payments on any two mortgages must be zero.  The calculation is correct only if the correlation is zero.  This crucial assumption was not stated.  The claim is false as written.</p>
<p>One way in which structured finance almost destroyed the world economy was very close to this but not so very very extreme.  CDO designers and raters assumed that they could estimate correlations between default on different bonds assuming that default occurred if a latent variable were below zero and that the latent variables were jointly normal.  There was no justification for the assumption of joint normality.  Then they assumed that the CDS market was efficient (schizzo-finance) so they could estimate the correlations of the latent variables.</p>
<p>This is less extreme than just assuming that correlations are zero without even stating the assumption.  However, it was extreme enough to cause a disaster.  </p>
<p>Amazingly, after the disaster based on casual assumptions about correlation, Alex Tabarrok makes a much more extreme assumption and doesn&#8217;t even state it.</p>
<p>Note there are no ellipses in my quote of Tabarrok.  That is the post in full from the first word to the false claim of 2.82%.  </p>
<p>I am sincerely shocked and appalled.</p>
<p>update:  There is another problem with the example.  Given independence of defaults across mortgages, the probability of default of the 10th tranche is dramatically different if the probability of a default of each mortgage is 6% not 5%.  However, the probability of default of the 12 tranche is tiny in either case and the probability of default of the 8th tranche is large in either case.</p>
<p>The example illustrates the properties of 10, 5 and 6 not the effect of 5 vs 6.  </p>
<p>A small difference in the probability of default for uncorrelated default risks matters a lot for a small interval of tranches. For probabilities other than 5 and 6 the change from very small to high probability would occur at a range different from 8th to 12th but only for a small range.  </p>
<p>The market value of such small ranges was not large enough that serious misspricing of them (in the range from safe to worthless) could bring down the financial system.</p>
<p>Similarly the tranches of pools of 10th tranches are very different but tranches of pools of 12th tranches would be safe in either case and the 10th tranche of a pool of 8th tranches would be risky in either case.  Again pools of 10th tranches of pools weren&#8217;t important.</p>
<p>You just can&#8217;t make huge unexpected losses out of a tiny change in the mean and variance of the flow of money from debtors unless people make huge side bets and there are huge unexpected gains too.</p>
<p>In contrast, underestimating the correlation of default across mortgages can lead to a major underestimate in the variance of the flow of money from debtors to the financial system.  That error, althoug much less extreme than the unstated independence assumption in the example, was an important part of the crisis.</p>
<p>The example ignores the important issue and emphasizes a very unimportant issue.</p>

<blockquote><p>This recovery is decidedly anti middle class. Wages will not keep up with rising prices, health care premiums and taxes. A good deal of the gains, so far, are going to Wall Street and the medical and intellectual property industries.</p>
<p>At 5.6 percent, fourth quarter GDP growth was pumped up by a slower place of inventory draw down&#8211;in the arcane world of GDP accounting a slower pace of depletion adds to growth. Although the inventory rebuild has begun, the pace is slow reflecting tepid sustainable demand for U.S. goods and services.</p>
<p>Adjustments to inventories accounted for 3.8 percentage points of growth. Demand for U.S.-made goods and services&#8211;the key to sustainable growth—added only 1.8 percent to growth. Domestic demand&#8211;less a bump in net exports that is not likely to be sustained—added only 1.5 percent.</p>
<p>Backing out the inventory adjustments, real GDP increased about $150 billion the second half of 2009 after bottoming in the second quarter—just about the amount paid out on Wall Street for 2009 bonuses.</p></blockquote>
<p>What are the implications for most of us?  By age cohort?  By income levels?</p>

<p><strong>Recessions, Part 3: The Aftermath</strong><br />This post looks at the length &#038; severity of a recession and compares those factors to the length &#038; speed of the previous recession. Data on the length of the recession, in months, comes from the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">NBER</a>, and data on real GDP per capita (the measure of growth and shrinkage used in this post) comes from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">the BEA</a>. As noted in the second post in the series (link below), real GDP per capita data &#8220;is available annually from 1929 to 1946 and quarterly thereafter. I did no smoothing &#8211; that is to say&#8230; for an event that occurred in January, February, or March of 2001, as an example, I used figures for Q1 of 2001.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, let&#8217;s go. Figure 1 below shows the annualized shrinkage during a recession v. the length of the following expansion (in months).</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK8zhMQvI/AAAAAAAAAHs/026Lc2INiaU/s1600/mike1.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK8zhMQvI/AAAAAAAAAHs/026Lc2INiaU/s320/mike1.bmp"></a><br />Figure 1.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />No obvious relationship, right. But check out Figure 2, which shows the annualized shrinkage during a recession v. the speed of the following expansion.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK9AjGqZI/AAAAAAAAAH0/qfi8ATZ4wec/s1600/mike2.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK9AjGqZI/AAAAAAAAAH0/qfi8ATZ4wec/s320/mike2.bmp"></a><br />Figure 2.</p>
<p>Well&#8230;. this seems a bit less unambiguous&#8230; in general, the faster the drop, the faster the growth that follows. In general.</p>
<p>Does that suggest rapid growth for us now, what with the Great Recession and all? Actually, no. On an annualized basis, the Great Recession produced only the seventh fastest decline among the 14 recessions that begin with the monster of 1929. What made the Great Recession so awful was its length &#8211; it was the longest downturn since the Great Depression. Interestingly, of the only two that were comparable in length &#8211; one came a few years after big decreases to the marginal tax rate (the recession that began in &#8217;73) and one came the year big cuts to the marginal rate were announced (the recession that began in &#8217;81). It would appear that the only big decrease in marginal tax rates that didn&#8217;t have a very lengthy recession hanging around them happened in 1964. Nobody is saying recessions are caused by tax cuts&#8230; but one wonders why tax cutting goodness isn&#8217;t a bit better at eliminating the problem.</p>
<p>But I digress&#8230; so back to the grind. The next graph shows the length of recessions v. the length of the following expansions.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK9VTR8II/AAAAAAAAAH8/sgA1fpdrSIM/s1600/mike3.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK9VTR8II/AAAAAAAAAH8/sgA1fpdrSIM/s320/mike3.bmp"></a><br />Figure 3</p>
<p>Again&#8230; no clear relationship.</p>
<p>But, there seems a relationship between the length of a recession and the rate of growth during the subsequent recovery.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK94hTRLI/AAAAAAAAAIE/BA5yK90v114/s1600/mike4.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S-lK94hTRLI/AAAAAAAAAIE/BA5yK90v114/s320/mike4.bmp"></a><br />Figure 4</p>
<p>It seems that in general, longer recessions are associated with faster recoveries. And this does, hopefully, portend good things for the current expansion. No guarantee, of course, but we can all keep our fingers crossed.</p>
<p>Kind of as an aside, in the last post on this topic, reader K Harris asked whether any of this recession analysis can shed any light on the Great Moderation. And to be honest, I&#8217;m not sure. Assuming the GM began after the early 80s recession, and ran until the start of the most recent disaster, it was a period with two short, relatively mild recessions. During the expansions, growth was pretty good in stretches (pieces of the Reagan and Clinton administrations) and frankly, pretty lousy (most of the Bush and Bush administrations). I wonder whether perhaps the automatic stabilizers and Fed policy (Reagan and Bush 2 were the beneficiaries of some serious real M1 per capita growth) helped prevent periods in which there wasn&#8217;t much of an expansion from dipping into recessions. I dunno. Thoughts?</p>

<blockquote><p>I am pleased to announce the publication of my book with David Colander and Richard Holt, <em>European Economics at a Crossroads</em>, being issued in both hardcover and paper back simultaneously from Edward Elgar. Several years in the producing, this book is the sequel to our 2004, <em>The Changing Face of Economics: Conversations with Cutting Edge Economists</em>, which created a bit of a stir by arguing for the possible existence of &#8220;non-orthodox mainstream&#8221; economists, with someone like George Akerlof being an example of this peculiar breed. We also argued strongly for viewing the economics profession and intellectual development as being a complex adaptive process.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prof. Rosser also had  <a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2010/05/europe-must-rewrite-social-contract-as.html">this to say about Europe and reporting</a> Tues. May 11 at Econospeak:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yep, there it is, the subheadline under &#8220;A new reality for the old world&#8221; for an upper left-hand corner, front page story by Howard Schneider on the front page of today&#8217;s Washington Post. Wow. Except that this is one of the most distorted and off-the-wall headlines to appear in such a place in a long time, with the obvious agenda of wanting to say the same for the US (time for that deficit commission to cut social security anyone?).</p>
<p>What is true is that for a country (e.g only Greece so far) to borrow from the newly established fund, put up by EU countries and the IMF and backed by the ECB, with a further backing by the US Fed, which has reopened its closed-down currency swap lines, it must engage in serious budget deficit reduction. Quite likely that will involve both spending cuts and tax increases, as have been voted for now by the Greek parliament, despite the riots in the streets by opponents of this.</p>
<p>However, let us be clear. First of all, this is not at all a statement or policy about &#8220;Europe&#8221; as a whole at all, much less social contracts in general. As of 2006 Greece had a lower percentage of GDP going to social spending (24.2%) than the EU average (26.9%). Countries with the highest percentages include some that have much less severe budget deficit problems, e.g. Germany, Sweden, France, Austria, the Netherlands. This is a problem of tax collections and corruption and underground economies, not of an out-of-control &#8220;social contract.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Coal Combustion Residuals</a>, often referred to as coal ash, are currently considered exempt wastes under an amendment to RCRA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.    They are residues from the combustion of coal in power plants and captured by pollution control technologies, like scrubbers. Potential environmental concerns from coal ash pertain to pollution from impoundment and landfills leaching into ground water and structural failures of impoundments, like that which occurred at the Tennessee Valley Authority’s plant in Kingston, Tennessee. The need for national management criteria was emphasized by the December 2008 spill of CCRs from a surface impoundment near Kingston, TN. The tragic spill flooded more than 300 acres of land with CCRs and flowed into the Emory and Clinch rivers.<br />EPA is proposing to regulate for the first time coal ash to address the risks from the disposal of the wastes generated by electric utilities and independent power producers.  EPA is considering two possible options for the management of coal ash for public comment. Both options fall under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). Under the first proposal, EPA would list these residuals as special wastes subject to regulation under subtitle C of RCRA, when destined for disposal in landfills or surface impoundments. Under the second proposal, EPA would regulate coal ash under subtitle D of RCRA, the section for non-hazardous wastes.     The Agency considers each proposal to have its advantages and disadvantages, and includes benefits which should be considered in the public comment period.   </p>

                                <p>“Liquidity” is another magic word.  I like it rather less than <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/05/friction-non-socratic-dialogue.html">“friction.”  </a>In the debate on financial regulatory reform opponents of tight regulations use the word liquidity as a magic spell which, they hope, will make all inconvenient evidence and arguments go away (no links my claim is like saying the Sun emits light).   The word is used with different meanings.  Sometimes it refers to something which is definitely good, sometimes it refers to the effects of structured finance.  This is an equivocation.</p>
<p>It wasn’t always this way.  Like “friction,” “liquidity” has been used for purposes other than special pleading and obfuscation.   I don’t know the history of the word, so I will start with a definition (which may not be the oldest definition) and explain how the word lost all useful meaning through over use.   As with “friction”  I think a good practical rule is to demand that anyone who makes an argument including the word “liquidity” be asked to rephrase it without using that word.  </p>
<p>Long long post after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>First money is liquid.  Money is any asset which can be used to buy anything or pay and debt right now.  Other assets are more or less liquid depending on how quickly they can be converted into money and how much that operation costs.   One definition of liquidity (the only one which I accept) is the cost of a round trip money to the asset to money divided by the price of the asset.   </p>
<p>When we describe the liquidity of an asset as a property of the asset, we are making a very strong totally false assumption.  We assume that the proportional cost of the round trip is constant and does not depend on the amount of the asset purchased then sold.  Of course this is nonsense.   For extremely small purchases, the cost of a round trip is very high.  Much more importantly the round trip costs of extremely large purchases can be much higher than the round trip costs of medium size purchases.  An extremely large buy order drives prices up and an extremely large sell order drives prices down.  It is this problem and no other which is being discussed basically every time a financier uses the word liquidity.    They call an asset liquid when huge positions can be taken and unwound with low round trip costs.   This sort of liquidity – large transaction liquidity – is not directly valuable to me or to 99.9% of people.  </p>
<p>The main point of this post is to object to the equation of round trip costs for medium size round trips and huge round trips.   However, the abuse of language is much worse.  A third meaning of liquidity is the money supply.  This is the sense in which Central banks are said to inject and remove liquidity via open market operations.  Here “liquidity” means “liquid assets.”  I don’t think this abuse of English is dangerous.  It is just very mildly irritating.</p>
<p>However, and much more importantly, “liquidity”  is also used to mean free cash flow.  It is in this sense that people distinguish between an illiquid firm (which can be profitably rescued with a loan) and an insolvent firm (which can’t).   The claim is that the problem for an illiquid firm is that its assets can’t be converted into money.</p>
<p>This is clearly a false statement.   Nowadays all assets can be sold.  Even in the past, firms could issue new shares.   The problem for an illiquid firm (with this 4th meaning of liquidity) is that no one wants to buy its assets.  The claim of the manager that her firm is illiquid is a claim that the asset prices are different from fundamental values.</p>
<p>The assets can be sold (as shares of the firm if need be) but people would not pay enough to cover the firm’s liabilities.   This is not because the instrument called the public offering of shares doesn’t exist.  It is because they don’t believe the assets are worth that much.  The claim of illiquidity not insolvency always is the claim that investors are wrong about fundamental values.   It hasn’t been a statement about available financial instruments since the invention of the joint stock limited liability company.   </p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if the firm’s effort to liquidate its assets would drive prices down or if prices are already low.  What matters is that the firm can’t get enough money for its assets to pay its debts.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this post, the point is that, other things equal, we would like firms to have a huge free cash flow.  Using “liquidity” to refer to free cash flow gives the word positive connotations.  The implicit suggestion is that market institutions such that huge round trips have low proportional costs will improve the cash flow of all firms.   This suggestion comes close to being an explicit argument when the same person describes the recent crisis as a liquidity crisis and says that tighter regulations will reduce liquidity.</p>
<p>A fifth meaning of “liquidity” is “market thickness”  or “trading volume.”  I’m fairly sure the word originally described assets.  Now it is often used to modify markets so thick markets are called “liquid markets.”  This is actually fairly important, since market thickness is key to making the round trip costs of taking and unwinding a large position low.   If I own 100 shares of IBM, the amount of money I can get for them depends almost not at all on trading volume the day I sell.   A minuscule fraction of current market volume would be enough that I don’t drive the price down by dumping 100 shares.</p>
<p>The identification of round trip costs for huge and medium round trips leads many people to consider high trading volume socially desirable.   Just try to imagine an explanation of why high trading volume is useful to someone who buys corporate bonds to save for her retirement or pay her children’s college tuition or buy a house.  It is just assumed that market participants frequently take and unwind huge positions.   The implicit assumption is that we should regulate so that the properties of the market please active traders.   Most people do not believe that active traders are socially useful.  The ambiguity of the word liquidity enables them to argue that the market should be designed for their convenience without their having to defend their claim to be socially useful.</p>
<p>Now an analogy – poker.   The thing that smart professional poker players want most is not so smart poker players (fish, suckers etc).  They want people who bet incorrectly so that they can take our money (they haven’t gotten any from me).  Now, what about the smart traders who want liquid markets?  Their view of the way markets should be is that, when they decide that an asset is underpriced, they can buy a whole lot of it at that too low price and, when they decide that an asset is overpriced, they can sell a whole lot of it at that too high price.   I can see why they think this is good for them (I think they are often wrong, because they don’t have rational expectations).  I can’t see why we should feel obliged to supply them with plenty of fish.</p>
<p>OK an example.  &#8220;The RMBS based CDO market became very illiquid in 2008.&#8221;  This sounds like a safe claim.  The fact is that the volume of trading of RMBS CDOs collapsed so the market became thin.  A market can be thin if everyone agrees on the fundamental value of assets and is pleased with their current portfolio.   This was not the case in 2008.  Many firms were very eager to get the CDOs off their books and no one had a clue what they were worth.  A market can be thin as it is perceived to be very risky so everyone likes to hold zero of the asset.   This was not the case in 2008.  Net holdings of RMBS base CDOs were not zero.  Many firms and individuals owned them and felt that they were bearing risk.  They would have liked to reduce their holdings.  </p>
<p>I think it is clear why the market was thin.  The market clearing price was much lower than it had recently been.   Very few  wanted to buy at any price higher than this market clearing price, but the owners of the CDOs weren’t willing to sell at the market price, because then they would have had to book the losses.  The market seized up, because it was necessary for it to seize up to neutralize mark to market accounting.  Here as in the case of the allegedly illiquid firm the problem isn’t that the assets were illiquid, the problem was that their market price was so low that firms couldn’t cover their liabilities by selling the assets.</p>
<p>Having no respect at all for the efficient markets hypothesis, I am perfectly prepared to believe that this was an irrational panic and that many firms could profitably be saved by an emergency loan.  It is not very bold to type that now, but at the time, I thought that the cost of a well designed TARP to the Treasury would be huge and negative – that the US Treasury had a huge gigantic profit opportunity.   </p>
<p>This opportunity was largely wasted.  My understanding is that the Treasury now guesses that it plus the Fed will make money saving banks (I count making good AIG fp obligations part of saving the banks).  Not enough to cover the losses from saving GM Chrystler, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac but quite enough to make it impossible for any semi-sane person to take the EMH seriously (of course I think no semi-sane person ever took the EMH seriously and I strongly suspect that Eugene Fama is semi-sane).</p>
<p>Well here we are finally at the end of an overlong post.  My conclusion is that the debate on financial reform is seriously endangered because of a gross equivocation.  It is insinuated that so long as trading volume is high, all firms will have an excellent cash flow.  It is almost stated that extremely high trading volume is useful to savers and small investors.  It is assumed that the problem in 2008 was that markets stopped working in a way pleasing to active traders who think that they can beat the market.</p>

                                <p>by Linda Beale<br />crossposted at <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/">Ataxingmatter</a></p>
<p><strong>Carried Interest: prospects?</strong></p>
<p>At the ABA Tax Section meeting in Washington last weekend, there was surprisingly little talk about the carried interest proposal.  Carried interest, for those who don&#8217;t work often in the partnership area, is the way that managers of real estate, hedge, and equity partnerships receive a generous payment for managing the fund&#8211;usually a &#8220;2 and 20&#8221; 2% of the assets under management annually and 20% of profits fee for services.  The 20% is claimed to be gains from asset dispositions rather than services (providing a preferential rate in some cases, as well as no payroll taxation) and often has been deferred through offshoring.</p>
<p>Various tax experts have called for taxing both the fee and carried interest as ordinary compensation subject to payroll taxes and always taxable at ordinary rates.  That proposal has been suggested in Congress at various times as a revenue raiser, but it has not yet been enacted as part of a bill, since the Senate has not included the House-passed version.  The Real Estate Roundtable has lobbied strenuously against the carried interest provision in past years and successfully joined with private equity, hedge fund, and venture capital firms to defeat the idea.</p>
<p>There is talk now of including it in the jobs bill that Congress hopes to pass before the end of May.  See Real Estate Group PUshes to Soften &#8216;Carried Interest&#8217; Tax Rise, Bloomberg, May 8, 2010.  Naturally, lobbyists are busy trying to eliminate or modify the provision.  The head of the Real Estate Roundtable noted that the group is arguing for a &#8220;blended&#8221; tax rate that would provide a rate between the capital gains preference and ordinary rates, or a provision that would apply the capital gains rates for gains from investments that the partnership holds for at least 2 years.  A spokesperson for the National Venture Capital Association siad that &#8220;we&#8217;re not accepting this as a fait accompli&#8230;we have not waived from our position.&#8221;  Id.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The argument for taxing the carried interest of &#8220;profits&#8221; partners as compensation income, however, is strong: there is little justification for further complicating the Code with blended rates or a new long-term holding period for the capital gains rate.  These managers should pay tax at ordinary rates and should also be liable for the ordinary payroll taxes on their full compensation income.  Sure, they won&#8217;t like it and they &#8220;won&#8217;t waiver&#8221; from trying to push the Senate to ensure their cozy deal.  But that is not a satisfactory argument for failing to make this change which is required for fairness&#8217; sake.</p>

We have a &#8216;war on drugs&#8217; and a &#8216;war on terrorism&#8217;.  Both involve specific policies and specific agencies, not the aid of Captain America and Ironman who are restrained good guy superheroes to keep us safe.</p>
<p>Please tell me&#8230;why are Miranda rights the focus here as a key issue?  That appears to be inaccurate as a trigger issue.  And why is any notion of indefinite detention of a US citizen on the table except as an massive expansion of bigger government?</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://lieberman.senate.gov/assets/pdf/TEA_full.pdf">Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself and Mr. BROWN</a> of Massachusetts) introduced<br />the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the Committee:</p>
<p>Lieberman seized on renewed fears of a terrorist attack to announce his latest legislative gambit: the &#8220;Terrorism Expatriation Act&#8221; &#8212; or &#8220;TEA&#8221; &#8212; which would revoke the citizenship of any American &#8220;who is found to be involved with a foreign terrorist organization as designated by the State Department.&#8221;</p>
<p>The measure came less than two months after Lieberman&#8217;s introduction, with Sen. John McCain, of another radical bill: The &#8220;Enemy Belligerent, Interrogation, Detention, and Prosecution Act of 2010,&#8221; which would grant the president the power to order the arrest, interrogation, and imprisonment of anyone &#8212; including a U.S. citizen &#8212; indefinitely, on the sole suspicion that he or she is affiliated with terrorism, and on the president&#8217;s sole authority as commander in chief. Lieberman&#8217;s new bill is an offshoot of the same principle, circumventing the Constitutional guarantees of due process for U.S. citizens by conveniently </p>
<p>
<blockquote>Two key Republicans and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg were at odds today over how far the federal government should go to withhold the legal rights of U.S. citizens suspected of plotting terrorist acts.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said he wants to devise a law that would help law enforcement officials detain and interrogate citizens suspected of helping terrorist organizations or carrying out a terrorist act.</p>
<p>Graham said he would envision creating a special court similar to that of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court for electronic surveillance. Law enforcement officials could appear before a judge of the special court to get permission to withhold rights from a citizen while they are interrogated.</p>
<p>Graham said he believed the constitutionality of such a system would be upheld.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t imagine the Supreme Court of the United States saying that the homeland is not part of the battlefield,&#8221; Graham said, speaking during a Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing.</p>
<p>House Homeland Security ranking member Peter King, who testified at the hearing, said he agreed with Graham. &#8220;We have to expect more attacks from those already in this country,&#8221; King said.</p>
<p>He said he wanted to create a separate category of citizens who are deemed enemy combatants.</p>
<p>Graham and King said they were particularly concerned that law enforcement officials might give Miranda rights to a citizen before all the possible intelligence can be collected about terrorist plots believed to be linked to that person.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eric Holder appears to be considering some sort of expansion of exceptions to the Miranda rule, eventhough I have seen no examples in the media where such an expansion of the rule was needed.  I have read opinion is mixed in the lower federal courts.</p>
