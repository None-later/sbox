                                <p>No wonder Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/chris-edley-on.html">has had no luck persuading Christopher Edley to get rid of the malfeasant John Yoo</a>.  As <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh051710.html">Bob Somersby observes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Christopher Edley thinks he’s one of your “betters.” It’s hard to believe, but that’s the exceptionally low-IQ framework this self-proclaimed member of the elite enunciated in Sunday’s piece. According to Edley, rubes like us should want our “betters” in important posts, like the post in which Kagan will serve:<br />
<blockquote>EDLEY: The tension between elitism and populism is embedded in our national DNA because America rejected the model of a monarch ruling by divine right in favor of an iffy experiment in democratic self-governance. So now you are responsible for choosing your leader. Do you want someone like you or someone better than you?</p></blockquote>
<p>What an astonishing framework! But so it goes when people like Edley spends decades inside institutions like Harvard, convincing themselves that they and their peers are “better” than all the rest of us rubes. [formatting in original]</p></blockquote>
<p>Kagan, like Yoo, &#8220;has excelled in a meritocratic system, one that is selective yet far more open than in generations past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bonus quote from Edley:<br />
<blockquote>The gatekeeper power of such institutions is why it was so important to desegregate them (using affirmative action, among other tools) and why virtually all leaders of great universities talk about diversity and access.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep.  Elena Kagan is All About Diversity.</p>
<p>At least <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/scott-horton-on.html">Edley is consistent</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Dean Edley rolls embarrassingly off the tracks.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The Effect of Tax Cuts and Tax Hikes on Economic Expansions</strong></p>
<p>Right about now, the U.S. economy appears to be recovering from a recession (and a nasty one at that). It’s not smooth sailing though; the recovery is still very fragile, and there are plenty of problems at home and abroad that can still derail the recovery.  Depending on which economist or politician or pundit you ask, there are a number of prescriptions for what to do in times like these, but there’s one thing that just about all these worthies agree on, namely that lowering marginal income tax rates (or at least not raising them) is vital.</p>
<p>But the fact that everybody believes something doesn’t make it true. So in this post, I’m going to show three graphs.  The first shows the length (in months) of every expansion since 1929.  The second looks at the annualized growth in real GDP per capita for each expansion period, and the third looks at the total growth rate in real GDP per capita over the length of the expansion period.  In each graph, recoveries are divided into three groups. <strong>Group 1</strong> is composed of expansions following recessions in which the top marginal tax rate was cut or for which the top marginal rate was cut within one year of the end of the recession.  <strong>Group 2</strong> is made up of recoveries for which the top marginal rate did not change during the recession or within a year of the end of the expansion.  <strong>Group 3</strong> has the expansions that suffered from tax hikes, during the recession itself and/or within a year of the end of recession.</p>
<p>A bit of housekeeping before I get started…  marginal tax rates are available from <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">this fine table provided by the IRS&#8217; Statistics of Income</a>.  Data on the starting and ending dates for recessions comes from <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">the NBER</a>, purveyors of recession and expansion dating for the U.S. economy. Real GDP per capita comes from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; National Income and Product Accounts Table 7.1</a>, updated on April of 2010.  Real GDP per capita is available annually from 1929 to 1946, and quarterly thereafter.</p>
<p>One more wee bit of housekeeping before we get to the good stuff…  for the sake of this post, I am going to assume that the real GDP per capita in any month is equal to the real GDP per capita for the quarter (or if prior to 1947, the year) in which it fits.  In other words, the real GDP per capita (in 2005 dollars) for the first quarter of 2008 is $43,997, and I am assuming that the real GDP per capita in any of the three months in that quarter (i.e., January, February, or March of 2008) is equal to $43,997.  That assumption shouldn’t cause any major changes in the results and it will keep me from having to go off on tangents about how the data was smoothed.</p>
<p>With that, here we go.  The first shows the length of each expansion, in months.</p>
<p>Notice… the expansions that follow tax cuts (either during the recession itself or at the start of the recovery) have tended to be the shortest ones in our sample.  And short expansions are definitely not a good thing; we’re all better off with expansions that go on for a while.  <br />What about the speed of the expansion?  The annualized growth (i.e., the speed per month) of real GDP per capita for each expansion since 1929 is shown below.  </p>
<p>This graph also does not appear to mesh with popular wisdom (not to mention accepted economic theory) in America today.  In general, when tax cuts occurred during or just after a recession, the resulting expansion has been slower than when the tax rates are kept unchanged.  Expansions associated with early tax hikes are the fastest of all.<br />Which leads us to the overall growth of the economy during the entire length of each expansion, which is shown in the next graph.</p>
<p>Once again, the theoretical benefits of a tax cut do not seem to match what the data shows, which is that least impressive expansions are those that follow decreases in marginal income tax rates (either during the recession itself or at the start of the recession). </p>
<p>So where does this leave us?  Well, simply put, the data and the theory/popular wisdom do not agree.  Going as far back as there is official data on economic growth, what we find is that expansions associated with reductions in the top marginal income tax rate have been shorter and slower than expansions that did not involve tax cuts.   Which means, simply put, that the theory is probably wrong, and we as a nation continue to buy into it at our detriment.  </p>

<p>From offshore accounts of individuals to transfer pricing scams of corporations<br />Michigan&#8217;s Levin says the next big thing for the government to focus on, now that the offshore accounting schemes of individual taxpayers have gotten its full attention, should be the corporate transfer pricing game.</p>
<p>What happens in transfer pricing?  Corporations in the US, for example, may develop a new drug and take out a patent on that drug.  If the patent is used in the US and the drug is manufactured here, the corporation will owe US income tax on its profits.  That tax is at a 35% statutory rate, but corporations don&#8217;t usually end up paying anything near the statutory rate on their economic profits&#8211;their effective rates are considerably lower, with many of the large US corporations paying no federal income tax whatsoever, from a combination of accelerated depreciation, loss deduction carryovers, and other &#8220;tax expenditures&#8221; that act to reduce their taxes (such as the many items in the Code that reduce taxes on Big Oil companies that extract natural resources&#8211;at great cost to our environment and coastal beauty, as it turns out).</p>
<p>One of the things multinational corporations do to lower their taxes even further is to shift income offshore.  Perhaps they have a reinsurance subsidiary, so they pay reinsurance premiums to that subsidiary and shift their actual insurance offshore.  Frequently, the companies that profits are shifted to have almost no employees.  They mail be just a mailbox conduit in the Netherlands or the Cayman Islands, where thousands of corporations are &#8220;located&#8221; in a single four-story building.  The tax code has a provision that is intended to empower the IRS to fight such manipulation of income.  It&#8217;s called the &#8220;transfer pricing&#8221; provision in section 482, which says that items of deduction, income, credit are supposed to &#8220;clearly reflect income&#8221;&#8211;meaning that taxable income should be related to economic income, except for provisions clearly intended to provide a special benefit (such as subsidies for corporations that Congress has built into the code, like accelerated depreciation and bonus depreciation).<br /><a name="more"></a><br />But policing transfer pricing is not easy.  It involves detailed facts and circumstances, takes inordinate time, and must ultimately be tried before courts that have been packed by GOP presidents with business-friendly judges, most of whom over the last thirty years have also enjoyed &#8220;educational&#8221; seminars in Chicago school-style economics funded by the Olin Foundation and sponsored by George Mason law school with the intent of influencing judges&#8217; decision-making in favor of the now-discredited &#8220;free market&#8221; thinking of Milton Friedman.</p>
<p>Accordingly, a number of tax and business experts have suggested that Congress should scrap the fact-intensive analysis required under current transfer pricing theory for a formulaic approach that would allot a percentage of a company&#8217;s profits to the US based on the number of employees, facilities and revenues in the US compared to elsewhere.  That sounds like a good idea to me&#8211;less audit time required, more objective, and less easily manipulated for the benefit of the corporate taxpayer.  As those who&#8217;ve read much of my scholarly work will recognize, I have long argued that the ability of a taxpayer to manipulate the income reported to the IRS Is problematic, raising questions of fairness and efficiency and administrability, all of which are important for tax policy considerations.</p>
<p>Bloomberg.com has an article today on the transfer pricing issue, written by a former Wall Street Journal reporter who knows the beat well.  I commend it to you for a view of the problem faced by the Congress and IRS as any attempt to crack down on transfer pricing scams gets underway.  It describes the &#8220;double Irish&#8221;.  And I have to admit, this was a ruse known widely to Wall Street law firms when I was there in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Have a company in Ireland, have it paid by a company in the Netherlands (which is just a conduit&#8211;no real company) in order to get the inter -EU<br /> protection from withholding, have that Netherlands company paid by a company in one of the Island tax havens (Caymans, Bermuda).  Behold! Lots of income leaves the US tax rolls, and doesn&#8217;t get taxed anywhere else.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The opening chapter of Jack Cashill’s <em>Popes and Bankers</em> relates his version of the tale of Melonie Griffith-Evans, a woman who in 2004 borrowed her way to losing her house.  Ms. Griffith-Evans accepted loans in order to buy a house priced at $470,000 that resulted in her having to pay “roughly $3,500 a month.”  Of course, she ends up not being able to pay those loans, and—since <em>ex post</em> is <em>ex ante—</em>the result must be All Her Fault.  Mr. Cashill allows as to how a “traditionalist” might “if feeling churlish, talk of  Griffith-Evans as a ‘predatory borrower.’ ”</p>
<p>Working solely from the information as provided by Mr. Cashill, let us test the validity of his hypothesis, assuming the “traditionalist” were sane.</p>
<p>Taking Mr. Cashill at his word on that “roughly $3,500 a month” and assuming that the ancillary loan is described correctly, Ms. Griffith-Evans would have to have taken out the following loans to buy the house for $470,000:</p>
<ol>
<li>A $  94,000 (20% of the price of the house, an amount Ms. Griffith-Evans did not have in savings) loan.  This loan—which I’m guessing was for 30 years was offered at the rate of 12.5%.  (Mr. Cashill stipulates this.) Presumably, it was not secured by the property itself.
<ol>
<li>This would produce a payment due of approximately $1,000 per month. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>A $376,000 (80% of the price of the house) 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, securitized by the property, at 7.00%
<ol>
<li>This is the only way to total $3,500 per month if we assume Ms. Griffith-Evans borrowed the entire 20%, which seems to be Mr. Cashill’s contention.  Otherwise, she only borrowed around $57,000 and made a down payment of around $35,000—certainly not the actions of a “predatory borrower.” </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>All of this excludes the closing costs or title searches or inspections or any of the other minutiae that is required before such loans are approved. But the process is transparent in Mr. Cashill’s tale, so we should assume that is the way he wants it to be.</p>
<p>Strangely, the details Mr. Cashill offers do not jibe with that. He claims that Ms. Griffith-Evans “took out a fairly standard 8.5% loan on 80% of the purchase price.” And—in a case of poor writing that betraying poor thought—he collaterally notes that the $3,500 payment due was “increasing as the loan was adjusted.”  This would lead to an initial combined payment of approximately $3,900 a month—more than 10% higher than “about $3,500,” though still significantly below the rental costs of “about $5,000 to $6,000 per month” for apartments that, per Mr. Cashill, “suited her fancy.”</p>
<p>Mr. Cashill is determined to argue that the loan Ms. Griffith-Evans took out was not “predatory,” but was an 8.5% mortgage rate “fairly standard” in 2004?</p>
<p> <a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S5m40QdQKfI/AAAAAAAAAZw/BVSPPqP4kgo/s1600-h/FairlyStandard4.png"><img title="FairlyStandard" height="469" alt="FairlyStandard" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S5m40ysTUPI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/nlPaZJLnjjw/FairlyStandard_thumb2.png?imgmax=800" width="644" border="0"></a> </p>
<p> </p>
<p>It doesn’t seem to be. Even the highest rate for conventional mortgages in 2004—6.29%—is  more than 220 basis points (2.20%) below the rate of Ms. Griffith-Evans’s loan, and that is excluding whether her rate was itself adjustable.  (It is unclear from Mr. Cashill’s account whether the 8.50% mortgage, the 12.5% additional loan, or both were adjustable.)  Or, to put it simply, the lender was <strong><em>charging Ms. Griffith-Evans more than a 35% premium for her loan</em></strong>.  Quite a premium to accept if one wants to be a “predatory borrower,” </p>
<p>One might fairly wonder why she was not offered a loan for the entire amount at a fixed rate that would produce a loan payment due of about $3,500 a month, eliminate the risk to the second, unsecured lender, and leave the primary mortgage lender with a less encumbered “owner.” (That rate would be 8.10% for a $3,500 per month payment, or—given Mr. Cashill’s figures—a loan of 9.30% for the entire amount.) Certainly, if the primary lender honestly believed the property was worth $470,000, they would have been willing to offer a loan for such an amount, with the attendant Mortgage Insurance.</p>
<p>Mr. Cashill wonders about none of those actors, either, however. Tis Ms. Griffith-Evans who is wholly at fault, from the Very Christian perspective presented.  Somehow, it was venal of her to elect to pay $3,500 a month for a house for her family, instead of half again more for an apartment.</p>
<p>I raise the possibility that the primary lender didn’t believe the house was worth $470,000—or even anything beyond $375,000—solely because the evidence runs that way.  There is first the fact that the lender was not willing to loan Ms. Griffith-Evans the entire amount—or even within 20% of  it—against the value of the property. (We can safely conclude this because the alternative is to believe that she, given the choice between paying 8.5% and paying 12.5%, honestly preferred the latter.)  The second piece of evidence comes from Mr. Cashill, who declares that the lender was “embarrassed” into allowing Ms. Griffith-Evans and her children to stay in the house—“presumably free of charge” (quite the presumption, that)—“while she tried to find a buyer.”  (Those of us who do not understand this behavior from a “predatory borrower” probably don’t understand Christianity either.)</p>
<p>Do I need to note that she failed to find a buyer? And that the lender clearly didn’t have one either, for—as Mr. Cashill continues—“When she failed to find one, the lender gave her still more time to find an apartment.”  The benevolence of lenders is legendary, to be certain, but this one is clearly destined for sainthood.</p>
<p>The world in which I live—clearly one with a different color sun than that of Mr. Cashill in this chapter—is one in which businesses make decisions based on revenue and cash flows.  So when the <em>seller</em> of the house accepted Ms. Griffith-Evans’s original bid, even with its dodgy financing, during the peak of the housing market, we must presume that they did so because they expected to receive more net money, easier, from that sale than from any other bid.  And we must presume the lender was fully aware of what they were doing—and charged usurious interest rates (compared to the market) accordingly.</p>
<p>So we have a situation in which, <em>ex ante</em>, all parties got the best deal they could, given the information they had.  Ms. Griffith-Evans paid around $1,000 a month less than she would have paid in rent, even  before any tax benefits.  The seller received a price to which they agreed, and which they represented as fair market at the time—with a lawyer doing a title search, a home inspector, and a home appraiser all corroborating that the property and the structure were as represented, and that the price was reasonably on the market (even if it wasn’t, or soon thereafter was not), all of whom were paid for their expertise and conclusion.  The lender received a significantly higher interest rate than they would have from another buyer, which presumably compensated them for their additional risk—and they had the property in reserve.</p>
<p>In the world in which the sun is yellow and Ms. Griffith-Evans is a single mother—not General Zod—economic agreements were reached consensually among the parties and of whom <strong><em>except Ms. Griffith-Evans</em></strong> were compensated professionals. Strangely, in the “traditionalist” world of Mr. Cashill, the one person in the entire series of transactions who is most likely to have been deprived of information is the one who should be described as “predatory.”</p>
<p>After a start like this, I can’t wait to read the rest of the book.</p>

                                <p>Sometimes, I hate being right.  Most of those times are when I take a pessimistic view of data; this has happened a lot recently.</p>
<p>It gets worse when the people who agree with you are none other than The Giant Vampire Squid.  As <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/05/15/number-of-the-week-0-growth-without-temporary-factors/">the Wall Street Journal notes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Zero — First quarter GDP growth, minus the temporary factors of government stimulus and inventories, as estimated by Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>With the economic recovery already nine months old, it’s easy to forget just how tenuous it remains. Consumers are spending and businesses are investing, but an uncertain amount of that activity depends on temporary lifts, most notably the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p>I promise to get enthusiastic about inventory growth when people stop claiming that the drop in sales is based on the Demand side of the equation; that the banks aren&#8217;t holding more than $1 Billion in Excess Reserves because they want to, but rather because they can&#8217;t find borrowers.</p>
<p>Looking at state budget projections for next year, the reality that inventories cannot grow indefinitely, the unemployment and discouraged-workers levels, and the growth in long-term unemployment, it&#8217;s difficult to find engines for growth.</p>
<p>Real GDP recovery is described fairly as, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/05/real-gdp-in-recoveries.html">at best, lethargic</a>.  And now we know that even the lethargic recovery is stimulus-induced, not real.</p>
<p>But the headline numbers have given an excuse to do nothing, and steroid withdrawal is, I am told, a very painful experience.</p>

<blockquote><p>On the Wall Street reform bill, the Senate, late last Thursday, rejected probably the most important measure proposed to reduce Wall Street power, strengthen financial stability and fortify our democracy: breaking up the banks.</p>
<p>By a 33-61 vote, the Senate defeated the Brown-Kaufman amendment, which would have forced the largest banks to get smaller. Three Republicans, including Richard Shelby, the ranking member of the Banking Committee, joined 30 Democrats in supporting the measure.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>Although the defeat of Brown-Kaufman was crushing, it was, nonetheless, an indicator of the strength of the populist call to break up the banks and reduce Wall Street power. A sign of Wall Street&#8217;s ongoing dominance on Capitol Hill had been its success in defining the call to break up the banks as outside the bounds of legitimate debate. Wall Street succeeded in the House, which did not seriously consider proposals to break up the banks. But it could not block the issue from an airing in the Senate; and once aired, the break-up-the-banks proposal gained substantial support, notwithstanding opposition from the White House and the chair of the Banking Committee, Chris Dodd.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Marshall Auerback is a Roosevelt Institute Senior Fellow and Braintruster at the <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2010/05/14/repeat-after-me-the-usa-does-not-have-a-greece-problem-10863/">New Deal 2.0</a>.</p>
<p><strong>By Marshall Auerback</strong></p>
<p>To paraphrase Shakespeare, things are indeed rotten in the State of Denmark (and Germany, France, Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal, and almost everywhere else in the euro zone). An entire continent appears determined to commit collective <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%28http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kB8n-pPYrPw&#038;feature=related">hara kiri</a>, whilst the rest of the world is encouraged to draw precisely the wrong kinds of lessons from Europe’s self-imposed economic meltdown. So-called respectable policy makers continue to legitimize the continent’s fully-fledged embrace of austerity on the allegedly respectable grounds of “fiscal sustainability”.</p>
<p>The latest to pronounce on this matter is the Governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn King. This is a particularly sad, as the BOE &#8211; the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street – has actually played a uniquely constructive role amongst central banks in the area of financial services reform proposals. King, and his associate, Andrew Haldane, Executive Director for Financial Stability at the Bank of England, <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2009/11/17/banking-in-a-state/">have been outspoken critics</a> of “too big to fail” banks, and the asymmetric nature of banker compensation (“heads I win, tails the taxpayer loses”). This stands in marked contrast to America’s feckless triumvirate of Tim Geithner, Lawrence Summers, and Ben Bernanke, none of whom appears to have encountered a banker’s bonus that they didn’t like.</p>
<p>But when it comes to matters of “fiscal sustainability” King sounds no better than a court jester (or, at the very least, a member of President Obama’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform). In <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/finance/edmundconway/100005657/us-faces-same-problems-as-greece-says-bank-of-england/">an interview</a> with The Telegraph, the Bank of England Governor suggests that the US and UK – both sovereign issuers of their own currency – must deal with the challenges posed by their own fiscal deficits, lest a Greece scenario be far behind:</p>
<p>“It is absolutely vital, absolutely vital, for governments to get on top of this problem. We cannot afford to allow concerns about sovereign debt to spread into a wider crisis dealing with sovereign debt. Dealing with a banking crisis was bad enough. This would be worse.”</p>
<p>“A wider crisis dealing with sovereign debt”? Anybody’s internal BS detector ought to be flashing red when a policy maker makes sweeping statements like this. The Bank of England Governor substantially undermines his own credibility by failing to make 3 key distinctions:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a fundamental difference between debt held by the government and debt held in the non-government sector. All debt is not created equal. Private debt has to be serviced using the currency that the state issues.</li>
<li>Likewise, deficit critics, such as King, obfuscate reality when they fail to highlight the differences between the monetary arrangements of sovereign and non-sovereign nations, the latter facing a constraint comparable to private debt.</li>
<li>Related to point 2, there is a fundamental difference between public debt held in the currency of the sovereign government holding the debt and public debt held in a foreign currency. A government can never go insolvent in its own currency. If it is insolvent as a consequence of holdings of foreign debt then it should default and renegotiate the debt in its own currency. In those cases, the debtor has the power not the creditor.</li>
</ol>
<p>Functionally, the euro dilemma is somewhat akin to the Latin American dilemma, such as countries like Argentina regularly experienced. The nations of the European Monetary Union have given up their monetary sovereignty by giving up their national currencies, and adopting a supranational one. By divorcing fiscal and monetary authorities, they have relinquished their public sector’s capacity to provide high levels of employment and output. Non-sovereign countries are limited in their ability to spend by taxation and bond revenues and this applies perfectly well to Greece, Portugal and even countries like Germany and France. Deficit spending in effect requires borrowing in a &#8220;foreign currency&#8221;, according to the dictates of private markets and the nation states are externally constrained.</p>
<p>King implicitly recognizes this fact, as he acknowledges the central design flaw at the heart of the European Monetary Union &#8211; “within the Euro Area it’s become very clear that there is a need for a fiscal union to make the Monetary Union work.”</p>
<p>This is undoubtedly correct: To eliminate this structural problem, the countries of the EMU must either leave the euro zone, or establish a supranational fiscal entity which can fulfill the role of a sovereign government to deficit spend and fill a declining private sector output gap. Otherwise, the euro zone nations remain trapped &#8211; forced to forgo spending to repay debt and service their interest payments via a market based system of finance.</p>
<p>But King then inexplicably extrapolates the problems of the euro zone which stem from this uniquely Euro design flaw and exploits it to support a neo-liberal philosophy fundamentally antithetical to fiscal freedom and full employment.</p>
<p>The Bank of England Governor – and others of his ilk – are misguided and disingenuous when they seek to draw broader conclusions from this uniquely euro zone related crisis. Think about Japan – they have had years of deflationary environments with rising public debt obligations and relatively large deficits to GDP. Have they defaulted? Have they even once struggled to pay the interest and settlement on maturity? Of course not, even when they experienced debt downgrades from the major ratings agencies throughout the 1990s.</p>
<p>Retaining the current bifurcated monetary/fiscal structure of the euro zone does leave the individual countries within the EMU in the death throes of debt deflation, barring a relaxation of the self-imposed fiscal constraints, or a substantial fall in the value of the euro (which will facilitate growth via the export sector, at the cost of significantly damaging America’s own export sector). This week’s €750bn rescue package will buy time, but will not address the insolvency at the core of the problem, and may well exacerbate it, given that the funding is predicated on the maintenance of a harsh austerity regime.</p>
<p>José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, Spain’s Socialist prime minister, angered his trade union allies but cheered financial markets on Wednesday when he announced a surprise 5 per cent cut in civil service pay to accelerate cuts to the budget deficit.</p>
<p>The austerity drive – echoing moves by Ireland and Greece – followed intense pressure from Spain’s European neighbors, the International Monetary Fund on the spurious grounds that such cuts would establish “credibility” with the markets. Well, that wasn’t exactly a winning formula for success when tried before in East Asia during the 1997/98 financial crisis, and it is unlikely to be so again this time.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the current context, the European authorities are simply trying to localize the income deflation in the “PIIGS” through strong orchestrated IMF-style fiscal austerity, while seeking to prevent a strong downward spiral of the euro. But the contradiction in this policy is that a deflation in the “PIIGS” will simply spread to the other members of the euro zone with an effect essentially analogous to that of a competitive devaluation internationally.</p>
<p>The European Union is the largest economic bloc in the world right now. This is why it is so critical that Europeans get out of the EMU straightjacket and allow government deficit spending to do its job. Anything else will entail a deflationary trap, no matter how the euro zone’s policy makers initially try to localize the deflation. And the deflation is almost certain to spread outward, if sovereign states such as the US or UK absorb the wrong lessons from Greece, as Mr., King and his fellow deficit-phobes in the US are aggressively advocating.</p>
<p>There are two direct contagion vectors off the fiscal retrenchment being imposed on the periphery countries of the euro zone.</p>
<p>First, to the banking systems of the periphery and the core nations, as private loan defaults spread on domestic private income deflation induced by the fiscal retrenchment. Second, to the core nations that export to the PIIGS and run export led growth strategies. So 30-40% of Germany&#8217;s exports go to Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal and Spain directly, another 30% to the rest of Europe.</p>
<p>These are far from trivial feedback loops, and of course, the third contagion vector is to rest of world growth as domestic private income deflation combined with a maxi euro devaluation means exporters to the euro zone, and competitors with euro zone firms in global tradable product markets, are going to see top line revenue growth dry up before year end.</p>
<p>Let’s repeat this for the 100th time: the US government, the Japanese Government, or the UK government, amongst others, do NOT face a Greek style constraint – they can just credit bank accounts for interest and repayment in the same fashion as if they were buying some helmets for the military or some pencils for a government school. True, individual American states do face a fiscal crisis (much like the EMU nations) as users of the dollar, which is why some 48 out of 50 now face fiscal crises (a problem that could easily be alleviated were the US Federal Government to undertake a comprehensive system of revenue sharing on a per capita basis with the various individual states). But, if any “lesson” is to be learned from Greece, Ireland, or any other euro zone nation, it is not the one that Mr. King is seeking to impart. Rather, it is the futility of imposing arbitrary limits on fiscal policy devoid of economic context. Unfortunately, few are recognizing the latter point. The prevailing “lesson” being drawn from the Greek experience, therefore, will almost certainly lead the US, and the UK, to the same miserable economic outcome along with higher deficits in the process. As they say in Europe, “Finanzkapital uber alles”.</p>
