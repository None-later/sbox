<blockquote><p>As the fall rolls in, Congress is expected to focus its attention on the fact that the huge tax cuts enacted under Bush (mostly in the 2001 and 2003 bills, but also in other bills during the Bush regime) were set up with sunsetting provisions.<br />&#8230;<br />This is a topic that is starting to heat up and is getting lots of media attention. Not surprisingly, there are also lots of groups busy trying to spin the discussion to suit their socio-political objectives, whether or not the spin informs voters accurately about the issues. Therefore, it seems that this is a good time to attempt to cover the debate from various perspectives through a series of articles. I expect to pick up various releases and &#8220;reports&#8221; from think tanks and groups and dissect them. Are they using more rhetoric than analysis? Are they using language that will tend to bias the reader rather than providing a firm foundation in information? What can we really expect if Congress enacts new tax cuts to &#8220;extend&#8221; the Bush tax cuts? What can we really expect if Congress does not enact new tax cuts but instead allows the current law to operate as intended?<br />&#8230;<br />Let&#8217;s look at an example of the kind of rhetoric that is flying through the blogosphere these days. I received a missive from &#8220;Melissa Kay&#8221; at a PR firm (Market Builders PR) that has pushed out various press releases about right-wing speakers to me in recent months. It is pushing Alan Olsen, the managing partner at Greenstein Rogoff Olsen &#038; Co. LLP, CPAs and his views of what will happen &#8220;if Bush Tax Cuts Are Eliminated&#8221;. The piece (no link provided) is called &#8220;Enjoy Them While They Last: End of Bush Tax cuts Could Throw U.S. into Deeper Recession.&#8221;</p>
<p>the initial heading is misleading (&#8220;Alan&#8217;s Predictions if Bush Tax Cuts Are Eliminated&#8221;)&#8211;the Bush tax cuts were set up to be temporary and expire by operation of law. Nobody has to do anything to &#8220;eliminate&#8221; the tax cuts.<br />The first paragraph is misleading.<br />here&#8217;s what it says: &#8220;Almost every tax cut implemented by Bush will disappear in 2011. Clinton raised taxes to 39%, Bush dropped the top tax rate to 36%. Obama will take it back to slightly more than 39%.&#8221;</p>
<p>here&#8217;s why it is misleading: Bush didn&#8217;t just drop the top tax rate. <strong>Bush dropped the top tax rate to 36% and then also raised the top tax rate up to 39% with an effective date of January 1, 2011. </strong></p>
<p>The first bullet point is misleading.<br />Here&#8217;s what it says: &#8220;What we have now is a war of free enterprise. The end of the Bush tax cuts in 2010 could throw us into a deeper recession.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s why it is misleading.</p>
<p>First, there is no &#8220;war of free enterprise.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Second, there&#8217;s really very little evidence to support the speculation that the slated expiration of the Bush tax cuts will &#8220;throw us into a deeper recession.&#8221; In fact, the flow of funds to the federal government and use of those funds for unemployment compensation and other state aid as well as public infrastructure projects could save us from entering into a depression. We are a very lightly taxed nation&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Heritage Foundation’s Rant against Reductions to the War Machine:<br />Talking points aired on 14 Aug 2010 AM session of C-SPAN TV.</p>
<p>US warfare spending will decline to 3% of GDP by 2019.  As if that is a problem.  GDP is meaningless, especially when you see the tiny threats that the large percent of US GDP is supposed to address, and doing it very badly.  </p>
<p>The figure that should be explained is what UK and Germany spend as percent of government outlays, aside from real reasons to have a war machine, a better measure than GDP.  That they won’t go there reflects the fear that if the US citizen saw how little the Europeans spend the rational question is “what do they see about security challenges differently than the US”?   The UK spends about 7% of outlays on “defence” while the US spends nearly 20% (just a bit less than SS outlays).  What is wrong with this picture?</p>
<p>&#8216;Rise of Peer Competitors&#8217; is invoked, the wish (unsubstantiated) that &#8216;some other country would spend as counterpoint to the US&#8217; does not make the reality test:  double digit increases in China and Russia are on the order of $5-6B US a year, as if that could equate to the <strong>$1.6 T</strong> backlog (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09326sp.pdf">GAO 09-326SP</a>) in the US in the 95 top investments the DoD is spendnding, all running late and 19% over original cost estimates, and not tested.   However, if the US does not spend the trillions better it is likely a $50B annual defense increase will keep it at bay.  (What is the GDP of the Taliban)?</p>
<p>But the push for austerity is now on the &#8216;cat food for oldsters commission&#8217; train, and the drive is to attack human resources costs as too high and/or identify the need to cut retiree and dependent health care and pensions so that more money can be added to the <em>overruns described annually by GAO</em>.  A department that cannot afford retiree health benefits must pay for huge fraud, and waste in its weapon procurement.  Heritage does not think the US needs to worry about military retirees because only 20% of the force will get to retirement?  Nice calculation for the personnel who do the fighting.</p>
<p>That most of equipment is from the 1970’s is an obviously false and cheeky comment and used to justify spending.  The reason is twofold:  first none of it is needed for the US without military peer competitors, and second the replacements are not needed  the money is wasted in an inept welfare system that keeps incompetent ideas from and the money chasing after failures and not terminating in an orderly fashion.  See such programs as the MV 22, F 22, B2, C 17 Littoral Combat Ships, San Antonio Class…. The list is long and the failure to actually replace hardware is less about stingy appropriation than ineptitude in the military industrial complex, which is paid well for the <em>second or third failed attempt </em>to build replacements for 1970’s (proposed against the Soviets by the way).</p>
<p>The US DOD should get less than 10% of US budget, and then carefully reduced to less than 5%.</p>

<p>Grupo Santander, the global banking giant, last year took control of Sovereign Bank.</p>
<blockquote><p>The largest bank in the Euro-zone, where it is based, Santander is the world’s eighth largest banking company by market capitalization. While the company is very good at generating profits around the world (it’s the world’s fourth largest bank by profits), this international meeting is focusing on something else: how the bank’s new U.S. branches might become as unionized as branches in Europe and Latin America. </p>
<p>Santander bank branches are on average 75-percent unionized outside the United States, according to UNI Global Union Finance Director Oliver Roethig because most other industrialized nations have unionized banking sectors. In the United States, however, less than 1 percent of all front-office bank workers are organized. In fact, the unionized janitors working for contractors that clean Sovereign Bank’s headquarters in Boston, Mass., often make more than the bank tellers and personal bankers, whose average wage is $10-$12 dollars per hour, despite individually producing millions of dollars in profits for the bank each year.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>But the financial sector, at the center of the U.S. economy, has never been unionized. The international workers and local leaders of the Service Employees International Union (SEIU) and Communication Workers of America (CWA) gathered in July to use the clout of global union federations like the UNI Global Union to give labor a foothold in Santander’s Sovereign operations, and potentially organize the industry from there. If Santander employees are heavily unionized overseas, and corporate profits are so robust, then why shouldn’t American workers also join a union? </p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;these unions didn&#8217;t destroy Sartander?  Puzzling. <alert sarcasm>  Next post let&#8217;s look at some numbers for Big Labor in the States.</alert></p>

As the currency tumbled, Q2 nominal export income grew quickly over the quarter for the top 5 economies in the Eurozone:
<ul>
<li>Germany, 6%</li>
<li>France, 4.6%</li>
<li>Italy, 8.3%</li>
<li>Spain, 0.8% (definitely the exception to the rule)</li>
<li>Netherlands, 7.2%</li>
</ul>
<p>The export income is welcome in Italy&#8217;s economy, one of the PIIGS countries (Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece, and Spain). But what about Greece, or the rest of the PIIGS countries that desperately need the external income?</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGrn6vlxztI/AAAAAAAADNI/tKuVChtM8as/s1600/export_chart.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGrn6vlxztI/AAAAAAAADNI/tKuVChtM8as/s400/export_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>Well, Greece actually did quite well in Q2: nominal export income was up 5.8% over the quarter compared to a 0.1% decline in Q1. Perfect &#8211; that&#8217;s the point, right? Nominal depreciation begets external economic support via exports?<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s not enough. The problem is, that the external support generated by a euro depreciation is too evenly distributed across the &#8220;Zone&#8221;. The result: those economies with both external and domestic demand posted record growth rates (i.e., Germany), while those with an overwhelming contraction in domestic demand posted further GDP declines amid reasonable external demand growth.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates the pattern in GDP quarterly growth for Eurostat&#8217;s reporting countries, ranked by Q2 2010 growth rates in order of smallest (Greece, -1.5%) to largest (Germany, +2.2%).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGro0QYUrzI/AAAAAAAADNY/63iuH_Mln6M/s1600/gdp_chart.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGro0QYUrzI/AAAAAAAADNY/63iuH_Mln6M/s400/gdp_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a><br />It should be noted here that the Eurostat data is a <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-13082010-BP/EN/2-13082010-BP-EN.PDF">&#8220;Flash&#8221; report of Eurozone GDP</a> only. The breakdown by spending category will not be reported until the second GDP release, which is scheduled for September 2, 2010. Therefore, the nominal export numbers, which are seasonally and working day adjusted through June 2010 (the volume indexes are only available through May 2010), proxy the strength of external demand.</p>
<p>The interesting thing is that export growth is likely strong enough to keep the third largest (as of Q2 2010) Eurozone economy, Italy, afloat for now. However, oncoming austerity measures (I searched for a list of announced European austerity measures, but only came up <a href="http://196.2.145.57/International/Austerity-measures-in-the-eurozone-20100715">with this</a> &#8211; do you know a credible source/link?) will drive the positive feedback loop: rising deficits &#8211; raise taxes/cut spending &#8211; cut domestic demand &#8211; taxable income falls &#8211; deficits rise.</p>

<p>Note: I included export data only, although the trade balance, which is exports minus imports, data tells a very similar story: widespread improvement in the trade balance.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not sure if I should post this here.  I think it might be stimulating.  However, I am ignorant and have no intention of learning (except from comments).  I feel free to display my ignorance after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The conventional wisdom seems to be that we have to do something about the long term deficit, but that the parties can&#8217;t agree on what to do and the people aren&#8217;t willing to let them do what is necessary.  I think the conventional wisdom is totally wrong on each count.  </p>
<p>First, I don&#8217;t think we need to do anything.  That is, I think that under current law, the debt to GDP ratio will stabilize and decline.  Obviously I shouldn&#8217;t just think this.  I can check CBO forecasts and know one way or the other.  The standard view is that, under current law, the deficit would vanish in the medium term and return and grow to an unsustainable level as the population ages and Social Security and Medicare spending increases.  This was true last year, but I don&#8217;t think it is true now.  The change is that the ACA (health care reform)would (according to the CBO) bring the growth of Medicare spending under control unless the ACA is modified.  The CBO forecasts that, under current law, Medicare spending will grow to about 6% of GDP and level off (from about 4% now).  The CBO also forecasts that Social Security OASDI spending will grow 1.2% of GDP and level off.  </p>
<p>So the long term current law deficits seem to me to be about 3.2% of GDP.  The long term inflation forecast is 2% and the long term read GDP growth forecast is 2 to 3% s, it seems to me that the debt to GDP ratio is forecast to decrease 1 to 2% per year over the long term.  That&#8217;s sustainable.  I think the conventional wisdom has not accepted the CBOs forecast of Medicare spending under current law (of course the conventional wisdom has still not accepted the idea that Medicare and Social Security OASDI are two different programs).  Or maybe &#8220;do something&#8221; includes &#8220;leave the current laws unchanged.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d even guess that deficits will be sustainable forever under current law plus doc fixes and AMT fixes, but that really is just a guess.</p>
<p>However, there is no chance at all that we won&#8217;t do something and, in particular, no chance that Bush tax cuts for the non-rich won&#8217;t be extended.  I&#8217;d say the main problem isn&#8217;t that the parties can&#8217;t agree on what to do but that they can agree to create unsustainable long term deficits.</p>
<p>As noted with more evidence in my post below, the US public seems perfectly willing to do what is necessary.  They are eager to soak the rich supporting allowing Bush tax cuts for families with income over $250,000 to expire and removing the FICA tax cap (and I think applying FICA to capital income).  I&#8217;m not sure a majority supports both measures, but I guess (again I am shamelessly guessing) that this would pretty much pay for the Bush tax cuts for the non rich and satisfy the Federal Governments intertemporal budget constraint.</p>
<p>Frankly, I think the long term deficit problem is that neither party is willing to follow the wish of the majority to massively increase taxes on the rich.</p>
<p>Please correct my errors of fact and logic in comments.</p>

<p>Jonathan <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=%22fuck+brad+delong%22&#038;btnG=Search&#038;aq=f&#038;aqi=&#038;aql=&#038;oq=&#038;gs_rfai=">FBD</a> Weisman strikes again.  I blame <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/08/confused-about-taxes">Kevin Drum</a> for the fact that I read a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703723504575425851623589976.html?mod=WSJ_hps_LEFTWhatsNews">grossly dishonest article of his in the Wall Street Journal.</a>   The article is about public attitudes on the deficit and on proposed solutions.    As a normal journalist, Weisman stresses anecdotes and only briefly mentions polling data.  <br />I list episodes of what I consider journalistic malpractice after the jump.   </p>
<p>The headline (not written by Weisman) contrasts with the text (written by Weisman or quotes chosen by Weisman).  The headline is “Voters Back Tough Steps to Reduce Budget Deficit.”  It isn’t that unusual for headlines to contradict the stories they head, but usually the evidence quoted in the article supports the article and not the headline.   Weisman manages the extraordinary accomplishment of presenting a less valid summary of the data he considered and wrote about than someone who just skimmed his article and wrote a few words under extreme time pressure. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>After (finally quoting polls) Weisman hands the mike over to Gary C Peters to allow him to contradict the polling data (presented immediately above in Weisman’s contribution to journamalism).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Folks want to cut the deficit, but they say, &#8216;Don&#8217;t touch my Social Security. Don&#8217;t touch my Medicare. Don&#8217;t cut defense spending, and don&#8217;t raise my taxes,&#8221;&#8216; said Rep. Gary C. Peters (D, Mich.), another member of the House budget-cutting task force. &#8220;This is going to take courage.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The data presented by Weisman in the paragraph immediately above say otherwise  </p>
<blockquote><p>the most recent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. In it, 74% said it would be acceptable to change Medicare to provide larger subsidies for low-income seniors, while cutting subsidies for the more affluent. Sixty-four percent would accept capping Medicare and Medicaid payments to health-care providers,</p></blockquote>
<p>Now one might interpret the cutting subsidies for the more affluent as meaning “more affluent than me” but capping payments to providers is exactly how the ACA restrains the growth of Medicare spending.  This is definitely a tough measure, and is definitely going to touch everyone’s medicare.  Either the poll is invalid or Peters is totally wrong.  Notably, capping payments to healthcare providers was exactly the hugest issue in US politics this Spring, with massive opposition.  The Republican party made its stand against exactly that.   They also denounced the individual mandate after supporting it for decades (and inventing the idea) and I assume they opposed eliminating the Medicare advantage boondoggle which they introduced, but their key issue, the one that put them ahead in the polls, is opposition to capping Medicare and Medicaid payments.  Also notably most Americans opposed those provisions of the ACA which most now support when a tiny bit of detail is added.   Weisman, however, pretends to have completely forgotten the whole health care reform debate.</p>
<p>He also allows Peters to argue that politicians will have to go against public opinion to balance the budget.  I think that before making such a claim, Peters would have to check what would happen if the social security tax were charged on all income and the Bush tax cuts for the rich were allowed to expire.   Both policies have majority support (Just above the Peters quote Weisman notes “58% backed subjecting incomes over $107,000 to Social Security taxes.”  I don&#8217;t know if he means “wage and salary incomes&#8221; since Social Security taxes are currently charged on wage and salary income not income, but hey I can’t expect a WSJ correspondent to know the difference can I ?).  </p>
<p>I think any remaining deficit would be small enough that the debt to GDP ratio would shrink.  Now this sure isn’t going to happen.  There is no way that Congress (or Obama) will accept elimination of the FICA ceiling.  This shows the problem is the exact opposite of that alleged by Peters.  The majority of Americans are willing to do what it takes to control the national debt (doing it to rich people).  Congress and the President are not willing.  </p>
<p>The nonsense Peters quote is the second to last paragraph in the article.  The last paragraph is much more bizarre </p>
<blockquote><p>Still, veterans of the budget wars see one reason for optimism in the subtle shifts in public opinion. Unlike politicians, most Americans don&#8217;t seem to place partisan blame on one party or another, so neither party can claim the high ground. &#8220;There&#8217;s no end in sight, and it&#8217;s both parties,&#8221; said Dani Saunders, 31, a conservative independent who keeps the books for her husband&#8217;s Richmond tattoo parlor.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t see why this is a reason for optimism.  It seems that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;as_q=ballance&#038;as_epq=&#038;as_oq=&#038;as_eq=&#038;num=10&#038;lr=&#038;as_filetype=&#038;ft=i&#038;as_sitesearch=rjwaldmann.blogspot.com&#038;as_qdr=all&#038;as_rights=&#038;as_occt=any&#038;cr=&#038;as_nlo=&#038;as_nhi=&#038;safe=images">ballance</a> has become such a central priority that it is considered grounds for optimism about the deficit that blame is assigned roughly equally.  I mention in passing that the evidence of the views of most Americans is a statement by a self declared conservative. It seems to me that Weisman considers the word “seems” to give him the result to make up claims of fact.   </p>
<p>More importantly, given the deficit reducing measures acceptable to the majority, any rational person would predict lower deficits if most Americans blamed the Republicans.  Republicans fought restraints on compensation of health care providers like death (panels).  Republicans certainly won’t raise taxes on rich people.  The only way the deficit will be brought under control is if the Democrats have a larger majority than their current majority.  That is, there are no grounds for optimism.</p>
<p>Further up, Weisman exposes his gross blatant contempt for facts in other ways.  He wrote “And complicating matters for Democrats, some liberal interest groups argue that Social Security is sound and in no need of serious change.” Weisman does not address the question of whether Social Security is sound.  The claim that it is is a problem for Democrats.  Deviation from the journalists conventional wisdom is definitely a bad thing, even if the journalists are demonstrably wrong, and the liberal interest groups are demonstrably right.  I assume Weisman thinks it is impossible to eliminate the deficit without cutting social security.  This is nonsense.   It is often repeated nonsense based on the invention of SocialSecurityandMedicare but it is still nonsense.  If Weisman were willing to read the arguments made by the liberal interest groups whom he considers to be a complication, he would know this (he would also probably suppress that knowledge being who he is).  </p>
<p>Worst of all he presents Paul Ryan’s “Roadmap” as exactly the sort of serious plan to deal with the deficit which is politically impossible.   Even he must know by now that the plan would lead to a deficit roughly as large as Obama’s proposals while increasing taxes on 95% of Americans and eliminating Medicare as we know it.  No passionate dedication to ignorance could have protected him from this knowledge.  Clearly he has decided that presenting Ryan as a hero is good copy and let the facts be damned. </p>
<p>Grounds for optimism ? After reading this article published in what was once a great newspaper I despair.</p>

                                <p>by: Daniel Becker<br />This is just a little something toward the “get to know your blogger” department of AB. It&#8217;s just in case anyone thinks that we have no real life. </p>
<p>Besides the 2 businesses, dealing with long term care issues for both parents (not even on the list of issues for this nation) and stimulating the economy by building my garage so that I can consolidate and stop paying rent, I&#8217;ve been jamming with some friends for a few years. </p>
<p>The goal was and is to be able to play out about once per month just for fun. All but one of us own a business, so it was decided from the get-go that this would not be as a supplement to our incomes. It was also decided that we were not going to be an Ipod (as in cover band), nor do general business. We like classic rock. Personally, my favorite is the late 60 to early 70&#8217;s, along with blues and Motown. We&#8217;re no polished act, but we manage to make a tune sound like music and at times even laugh with joy when we feel we&#8217;ve nailed it. You know, it&#8217;s that feeling you get when your loaded down and you go to that one thing in your life that you count on when you do it to give you the satisfaction that you can make something come out right and thus maintain a level head and not let anger turn to madness. </p>
<p>Well, we finally had our debut a couple weeks ago. Only took 5 years and 5 different people singing to get to this point. Who knew finding someone who wanted to sing and would stick around would be so difficult. If you&#8217;re curious, you can hear us playing <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GK-wbwowbOU">Alright Now</a>, our way.  Caution, it&#8217;s just a camera with recording ability that captured this, so the sound is not balanced the best. </p>
