<p>First and foremost the long-awaited Social Security Annual Report will be released at noon Eastern on Thursday Aug. 5th. If the release holds true to form it will also go live to the web at that same time. I will have a breakout of the Report at my blog <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2010/08/2010-social-security-report.html">2010 Social Security Report</a>  or you can get your own copy of the Summary (typically 15 pages) or the Full Report (250 pages) at the SSA Trustees Report page: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html I will be posting extracted Figures and Tables here at Angry Bear over the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Second a Social Security news site was brought to my attention by its siteowner. It is devoted to the nuts and bolts of Social Security administration with a focus on Disability. Nancy Ortiz, frequent commenter and Social Security veteran tells me she checks it daily. <a target="_blank" href="http://socsecnews.blogspot.com/">Social Security News</a></p>
<p>Third Aug 14th marks the 75th anniversary of Social Security and is celebrated in the new release of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/index.html">Social Security Bulletin: 75th Anniversary Edition</a>. Of particular note is an article by the Social Security Chief Actuary Stephen Goss <a target="_blank" href="http://www.socialsecurity.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v70n3/v70n3p111.html">The Future Financial Status of the Social Security Program</a> whose abstract is as follows:<br />
<blockquote>This article describes four concepts—solvency, sustainability, shortfalls, and solutions—as they apply to the financial status of the Social Security program as well as how Social Security financing fits in the general federal budget. The little-understood basis for future projected shortfalls is explained and detailed in relation to the possible solutions.</p></blockquote>
<p>A very valuable resource.</p>
<p>Fourth. August is also the normal publication month for CBO&#8217;s Long Term Projection for Social Security. If it is released on schedule it will go head to head with the SSA Annual Report which for the first time allows us a real apples to apples comparison of the respective projections and methodologies without the normal April to August time lag. If so it should be good fun.</p>

<p><strong>“One in 31 Adults”</strong></p>
<p>are under the control of the correctional system (prison, parole, probation) according to a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pewcenteronthestates.org/uploadedFiles/PSPP_1in31_report_FINAL_WEB_3-26-09.pdf">March 2009 Pew Center Report</a> of the same title. 1 in every one hundred adults are imprisoned in jail, state prisons, or federal facilities. 25 years ago those under the control of the correctional system was one in 77 adults. The population under correctional control is ~ 7.3 million (2007).</p>
<p>What does a growing prison and correctional population cost for taxpayers? To support the growing state prison population, costs range from ~$13,000 in Louisiana to ~$45,000 in Rhode Island annually (2005). The average is ~$23,000 annually, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/29/us/29prison.html">“US Imprisons 1 in every 100 Adults”</a> NYT. The cost of imprisonment compares nicely to a state or private college education (another story). As a whole the US imprisons a higher percentage of its population than any other nation in the world from which the cost burden of housing prisoners has become an issue for states with a decreasing/stagnant economy and decreasing tax revenues. Paradoxically while costing more, jails and prisons for many communities are a stable and growing business employing people, services, and a fast growing part of the rural economies.</p>
<p>Incarceration Nation as one part of, Schmidt, Warner, and Gupta’s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue53/SchmittWarnerGupta53.pdf">“The High Budgetary Cost of Incarceration”</a> (Real-World Economics Review, Issue no. 53) suggest much of the increased numbers of those under control of the correctional system result from harsher sentencing guidelines which in turn also have a lesser impact on crime. The mandated guidelines (drugs, three strikes, recidivism issues, etc.) result in higher imprisonment rates and consequently long sentences, higher costs to house prisoners as more prisoners are kept interned for longer periods, and have a diminished impact on crime.</p>
<p>By historical standards the rate of imprisonment in the US is 350+ percent of what it was in 1980. Globally, the US is 3 times higher than the nest in line for imprisonment, seven times higher than the median rate for an OCED country, and seventeen times higher than Iceland which has the lowest rate of incarceration. And yet, the increases in imprisonment can not be explained with certainty by increases in crime. While crime did increase from 1990 to 1992, there was a fall off of crime in later years. In 1992, violent crime peaked at 44% higher than its 1980 level and property crime at 7% above its 1980 level. During the same time period, incarceration grew to 150% of its 1980 level. After 1992, crime decreased to a level close to its 1980 level.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>It is possible to make both an economic and crime impact argument for less harsh sentencing guidelines. Table 3 illustrates 1 in 4 drug offenders are more likely to be imprisoned rather than placed on probation or released earlier on parole. The increase for drug offenders is up from 1 in 10 in 1980.</p>

<blockquote>“The most sophisticated analyses generally agree that increased incarceration rates have some effect on reducing crime, but the scope of that impact is limited: a 10 percent increase in incarceration is associated with a 2 to 4 percent drop in crime. Moreover, analysts are nearly unanimous in their conclusion that continued growth in incarceration will prevent considerably fewer, if any, crimes than past increases did and will cost taxpayers substantially more to achieve.” Stemen (2007). See also Austin et al. (2007), Irwin, Schiraldi, and Ziedenberg (1999), and Public Safety Performance Project (2007).</p></blockquote>
<p> “The High Budgetary Cost of Incarceration”</p>
<p>While the study suggests there is a correlation between harsher sentencing guidelines and the lessening of crime by imprisoning people at earlier ages and harsher sentencing both of which acts as a deterrent to crime, the impact is small and costly in dollars and in societal costs. The increased harsher sentencing guidelines diminishes with the severity of the sentencing and is determined to be as little as a reduction of 2% in crime with an increase of 10% in incarceration. Played out in the harsher sentencing guidelines are costs of ~$75 billion in 2008 up from under $20 billion in 1980 with 60% being borne by state and local governments.</p>
<p>Table 4 suggests a modification of sentencing guidelines of ~50% in sentencing guidelines at the federal, state, and local level would result in reductions in cost of ~$17B with the greatest impact being felt at both a state and local level, the governments restricted by budgeting mandates. The changing of minimum sentencing, truth in sentencing, and three strikes guidelines for non-violent crimes would contribute significantly to increases in prison population.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TFj9dsfQTJI/AAAAAAAAAWI/CwVRtWqURQk/s1600/crime2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TFj9dsfQTJI/AAAAAAAAAWI/CwVRtWqURQk/s320/crime2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>This only touches upon sentencing guidelines. Reviewing the actions of state parole boards, one would find many of them are denying parole and holding prisoners well beyond the minimums declared by the sentencing guidelines which are followed by state judges. Add to this an interpretation of a “life sentence” to mean a life in prison in the parole board system the same as a sentence of “natural life.” In effective, the Parole Board is acting as a secondary and more restrictive court in action as appointed officials. Parole boards have little, if any, legal basis to interpret the law differently then the sentencing as interpreted by judges of state law. States could achieve a significant cost reduction in prison costs by holding state parole boards to the sentencing guidelines passed by the state and representative of the population who elected the legislature who passed the guidelines. This restriction on parole boards would add to the cost reduction achievable through a lessening of sentencing guidelines.</p>

<p>The Ryan Budget Roadmap was introduced in January, and then sank like a stone. But with Ryan&#8217;s appointment to the Catfood Commission it and its author have drawn some new attention which borders on fawning. Or at least part of the plan has drawn attention, that part which would privatize Social Security and voucherize Medicare. What is getting less attention is his radical tax plan which if fully implemented would mean inheritors of great wealth would never pay federal taxes. EVER.</p>
<p>To set the background we have this article from the WaPo Monday <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/01/AR2010080103518.html">Rep. Ryan pushes budget reform, and his party winces</a> And it turn frames it as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Instead, Ryan is running a campaign of a different sort, one his party has so far refused to adopt: He is determined to persuade colleagues to get serious about eliminating the national debt, even if it means openly broaching overhauls of Medicare and Social Security.</p>
<p>He speaks in apocalyptic terms, saying the debt is &#8220;completely unsustainable&#8221; and warning that &#8220;it will crash our economy.&#8221; He urges fellow politicians, and voters, to stop pretending that this problem will go away on its own.</p>
<p>He administers his sermons with evangelical zeal. He will go anywhere and talk to anyone who will listen. When he is not writing op-eds and appearing on television, he can often be found speaking to liberal and conservative audiences alike about his &#8220;Roadmap for America&#8217;s Future,&#8221; a plan he says would fix the problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what is step one and two in cutting &#8220;completely unsustainable&#8221; debt? Well slashing Social Security and Medicare. And step three? ELIMINATE ALL TAXATION FOR BILLIONAIRES AND THEIR HEIRS. Details directly from Ryan&#8217;s website under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The main page for the Roadmap is here: http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/ If we go to the tax reform page we get the following (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>This plan discards a needlessly complex and manipulative tax code, replacing it with a simplified mechanism that promotes work, saving, and investment.</p>
<p>Provides individual income tax payers a choice of how to pay their taxes – through existing law, or through a highly simplified code that fits on a postcard with just two rates and virtually no special tax deductions, credits, or exclusions (except the health care tax credit).<br />Simplifies tax rates to 10 percent on income up to $100,000 for joint filers, and $50,000 for single filers; and 25 percent on taxable income above these amounts. Also includes a generous standard deduction and personal exemption (totaling $39,000 for a family of four).<br />Eliminates the alternative minimum tax [AMT].<br />Promotes saving by eliminating taxes on interest, capital gains, and dividends; also eliminates the death tax.<br />Replaces the corporate income tax – currently the second highest in the industrialized world – with a border-adjustable business consumption tax of 8.5 percent. This new rate is roughly half that of the rest of the industrialized world.</p></blockquote>
<p> First thing to note is that this plan for &#8216;simplification&#8217; sets up two parallel tax systems, allowing people to stay on the existing one if they like. Considering that just about everyone would get a  tax cut under the new system why even have this provision in? Because Ryan can only make his revenue projections by assuming that most people will willingly stay on the old system and pay more taxes. But that headshaker pales in comparison to the implications of the text I bolded.</p>
<p>These provisions are billed as encouraging &#8216;savings&#8217;, but on inspection &#8216;savings&#8217; here goes far beyond a worker&#8217;s 401k, it includes ALL investment by anyone including billionaires like Peter G Peterson and Warren Buffett. Because while you can get to be a millionaire by being paid direct compensation by your employer and even a multi-millionaire you don&#8217;t become a billionaire that way, instead billionaires get their money from a combination of dividends, asset sales (capital gains), regular interest, and in some cases &#8216;carried interest&#8217;. Under the Ryan Roadmap all of that would be 100% tax free as would passing it on to your heirs. In turn that would mean that all inheritors and their heirs in turn could if they choose live their whole lives without paying a penny in federal taxes, as distributions from their trust funds would all come in the form of dividends, asset sales, and interest. And of course they would get full enjoyment of all real and personal property accumulated: mansions, art collections, yachts, jewelry, after a couple of generations even the Queen of England might get jealous of all your swag.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a deficit reduction plan, this is a Randian wet dream that would reward the &#8216;Producers&#8217; (here defined as the Trustafarian class living off of grandpa&#8217;s wealth) at the total expense of the &#8216;Parasites&#8217; (that is though people actually contributing to future productivity via labor). This is what passes for &#8216;serious&#8217;, for &#8216;intellectual&#8217;, for &#8216;courageous&#8217; in the Republican Party today. BOLD ENOUGH TO GIVE 100% TAX BREAKS TO BILLIONAIRES.</p>
<p>Note that there is no hint of this in the WaPo article. Now I might have just let this WaPo article pass as being, after all old news, except this Ryan worship seems to be coming a trend. Because CNN followed up with this puff piece this morning <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/us/politics/03ryan.html?hpw">A Young Republican With a Sweeping Agenda</a><br />
<blockquote>In this highly charged election season with both houses of Congress at stake, not a lot of politicians are lining up publicly behind Mr. Ryan. He is, nonetheless, suddenly a rising star in some corners. And like many other politicians whose ideas were once considered extreme, only to later be mainstream — like Ronald Reagan — Mr. Ryan is seen as on the leading edge of something.</p>
<p>Why? His “Roadmap for America’s Future,” an elaborate (critics say drastic) plan that aims to erase the federal debt by 2063, simplify the tax code and significantly alter (his critics say eviscerate) Medicare and Social Security. When asked to handicap the 2012 Republican presidential field, Sarah Palin called Mr. Ryan “sharp.” Newt Gingrich dubbed him “extraordinarily formidable.” And, in a column, George Will imagined him as vice president to a President Mitch Daniels (now the Republican governor of Indiana).</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan, 40 and the ranking Republican on the House budget committee, has been in Congress 12 years, but it may have been President Obama who gave him and his Roadmap the broadest attention yet. This year, Mr. Obama alluded to the plan as a “serious proposal,” though the White House promptly made it clear that it had problems with its details.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just kill me now. This plan that proposes to cut almost all taxation on capital, and all taxation on individual holders of capital,  is billed as &#8216;simplification&#8217;, as something that in time might be seen as &#8216;mainstream&#8217;, that even Obama is willing to dub a &#8216;serious proposal&#8217; although he might have some &#8216;problems with its details&#8217;. Ya think? Anyone want to calculate the cost of THIS proposal over the Infinite Future Horizon?</p>
<p>No one who had read through this plan and thought through the implications could take it seriously.<br />Many people in the major media and in the Beltway take it seriously.</p>
<p>Well it doesn&#8217;t take a lot of logical chops to complete this syllogism and draw the right conclusion. These people are fundamentally not serious, in large part because they know that the American people as a whole are not likely to hold them accountable for not doing their homework. Or maybe one of our crack commenters can explain how you describe a plan to slash trillions in tax on capital still can be scored as solving the long-term budget crisis. You can start with the CBO score of the Roadmap. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10851/01-27-Ryan-Roadmap-Letter.pdf">CBO: Letter to Congressman Ryan</a>. Why didn&#8217;t CBO notice and score the huge hold the Roadmap would blow in future revenue. Simple, they were instructed to ignore it (bolding mine) .<br />
<blockquote>Other Tax Provisions. The proposal would make significant changes to the tax system. However, as specified by your staff, for this analysis total federal tax revenues are assumed to equal those under CBO’s alternative fiscal scenario (which is one interpretation of what it would mean to continue current fiscal policy) until they reach 19 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2030, and to remain at that share of GDP thereafter.</p></blockquote>
<p> Although in truth it is not all just supply-side fairy dust, because the plan does raise some significant revenue. By putting new taxes on labor.<br />
<blockquote>The Roadmap would also eliminate the income and payroll tax exclusions for employment-based health insurance. As a result, more earnings would become taxable for Social Security purposes, thus boosting future benefit payments, and payroll tax revenues credited to the Social Security trust funds would increase.</p></blockquote>
<p> Yep, even if you don&#8217;t earn enough to actually be exposed to income tax, you get to pay a payroll sur-tax from the first dollar on the value of your employer supplied health insurance (if any). The implications of this would require a post of their own.</p>
<p>Ryan Roadmap: Cut taxes on the rich, increase taxes on the poor. Now that is tax simplification we can all believe in! (Not).</p>

<p>Elizabeth Warren: My Mission Is to Restore America&#8217;s Great Middle Class<br />At Netroots Nation, Elizabeth Warren spoke about how the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could help protect the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>August 1, 2010 | </p>
<p>Editor&#8217;s note: The following is a speech delivered by Elizabeth Warren at Netroots Nation 2010. Check out AlterNet&#8217;s petition at Change.org urging President Obama to appoint Warren to lead the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.</p>
<p>My grandmother, when she was a teenager, drove a wagon in the land rush that settled Oklahoma. Her mother was dead, and her little brothers and sisters were in the back of the wagon. Her father had ridden ahead and tried to find a piece of land that might be somewhere near water&#8211;a hard task in Oklahoma. She grew up in that part of the world, she met my grandfather, they got married, they started building one-room schoolhouses and little modest homes across the prairie. They had kids, they stretched, they scratched, they worked hard, they made a little money, and they put it aside, put it in the bank. It got completely wiped out in 1907 in an economic panic. But like many American families, they came back. They started scratching and stretching again, and having more babies&#8211;and then the Depression came. And they got wiped out one more time.</p>
<p>You see, my grandmother was born into the world of boom and bust, boom and bust, as it had been from 1794 until the Great Depression. But my grandmother also lived in a world of economic transformation. Because coming out of the Great Depression, just three laws fundamentally altered the course of America&#8217;s history.</p>
<p>The first one, FDIC insurance, made it safe to put money in banks. The second one, Glass-Steagal, tried to separate the risk-taking on Wall Street from your local community bank. And the third one, SEC regulations, provide some cops to watch the robbers. And so, out of that, what we got was 50 years of economic peace. No financial panics, no meltdowns. And during that 50 years, we built a strong and prosperous middle class in America.</p>
<p>Now, my grandmother, when she died in 1970 at the age of 94, had been part of that. She owned a little house, she had plenty of groceries in the cupboard, and she had some cash in the bank. She was part of the growth of middle-class America. As were her children and her grandchildren. But shortly after my grandmother died, within a few years, we began unraveling that. Part of it was on the regulatory side. We hadn&#8217;t been clever about regulations. They stayed ossified. The regulations put in place in the 1930s had not been updated. They had not adapted to a new world. And along came a new group of people who said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just get rid of the regulations. What are they there for anyway? They just cost money. Dump the regulations.&#8221; And so the regulatory framework, or the &#8220;cops,&#8221; who were on the beat began to disappear. They lost their effectiveness. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..(more)</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2261947/">Dahlia Lithwick, in Slate</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the Citizens United [v. Federal Election Commission] argument last fall, Roberts openly criticized Kagan for abandoning one rationale for restricting corporate campaign spending and then pummeled her again in his concurring opinion in the case, dismissing the government&#8217;s argument as ‘at odds with itself.’ In an April case, Kagan took the position that U.S. attorneys speak only for their regional offices, not for the attorney general of the United States ‘That&#8217;s absolutely startling,’ Roberts replied. ‘The United States is a complicated place,’ Kagan retorted. ‘I take your word for it,’ Roberts snapped back. …</p>
<p>“Then Roberts took yet another whack at Kagan in his opinion in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, over a statute criminalizing the provision of ‘material support’ to terror groups. Roberts, while handing the victory to Kagan, repeatedly called out the government position for going ‘too far’ and running ‘headlong into a number of our precedents.’” </p></blockquote>
<p>The point of Lithwick’s article—its title and subtitle are “Roberts v. Kagan? Will there be friction between the chief justice and Elena Kagan on the Supreme Court?”—is that in most of the six cases before the Court this past term in which Kagan was lead counsel, apparently drafting the briefs largely herself, and then representing the federal government at oral argument—Roberts implied that he thought her handling of the respective case bordered on the incompetent. </p>
<p>Lithwick links to a more in-depth report and analysis of the exchanges by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15scotus.html?_r=1">New York Times Supreme Court correspondent Adam Liptak published in the Times</a> on April 14, before the close of the Court’s term. And in reviewing the instances that Liptak mentions, Roberts’ oral and written critiques of Kagan’s judgment calls strike me as suggesting that Kagan failed to recognize that the Office of Solicitor General is not some regional insurance-defense law firm or a regular local presence on behalf of state and municipal governments and their employees in run-of-the-mill lawsuits alleging violation of civil rights. Or, for that matter, a county prosecutor or state assistant attorney general. </p>
<p>All of whom always, always make arguments on behalf of their clients that are at odds with itself, or at least at odds with the argument they made successfully during the last round of motions and now find it expedient to pretend they had not. And who casually assert facts or positions of law that are every bit as transparently silly, or to borrow from Roberts, absolutely startling, as Kagan’s claim that U.S. attorneys speak only for their regional offices and not for the attorney general of the United States.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />I loathe Roberts, whose personal hallmarks as a justice (and before that as a nominee) are, best as I can tell, trickery and duplicity. So it’s a pleasant surprise that he found Kagan’s no-position-is-beyond-the-pale style of advocacy intolerably amateurish for a United States Solicitor General. But Roberts was truly a top appellate litigator, who regularly argued against other truly top appellate litigators, usually on behalf of very important clients, making awfully significant arguments about major issues of law. So he apparently thinks that there is a level of situational importance at which the cheap gimmicks should not be employed. And key First Amendment cases before the Supreme Court are among them, and the Solicitor General is someone who should recognize that. Most past solicitor generals did, after all. </p>
<p>So Roberts is right, but he does not go nearly far enough. It is by now deeply institutionalized throughout this country that attorneys who represent the government, and therefore, ostensibly, “the people,” use the same type of obstructionist, dilatory and even flagrantly dishonest tactics and gimmicks as attorneys representing private parties. Even—perhaps especially—in the service of preserving criminal convictions in the face of hard evidence that the conviction was wrongful, sometimes obtained in honest error, other times obtained through police or prosecutorial misconduct. </p>
<p>Which brings me to Pat Lykos, the current Harris County, TX district attorney, who upon being sworn in established a Post Conviction Review Section whose purpose is to actually investigate cases of possible wrongful convictions. An <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7128807.html">article published last week in the Houston Chronicle</a> is about the release, after 27 years’ imprisonment, of a man convicted of rape upon the sole basis of the victim’s ostensible identification of him. </p>
<p>But actually the ones who identified him—Michael Green is his name—were the police officers who arrested him on the night of the rape; he was walking in the area, the officers detained him, and when the victim did not initially identify him in a lineup, she was shown suggestive photos to ensure that in a second lineup, she did. According to the article, the attorneys and investigators in the newly-created Post Conviction Review Section who were assigned to the case found “a pair of jeans stored in a warehouse that had been worn by the victim during the crime, then testing it for DNA evidence. The results excluded Green.”</p>
<p>Three men committed the rape. The article says Lykos’ office “has identified all four men suspected in the crime, including the three believed to have sexually assaulted the victim.” But the statute of limitations prevents their prosecution.</p>
<p>The article quotes from comments by Lykos’ first assistant, a man named Jim Leitner, in a news release about Green’s release: “The evidence in this case had been sitting in the District Clerk&#8217;s Office for 27 years, and no one had taken the initiative to do anything with it in the past. The difference now is that you&#8217;ve got the Post Conviction Review Section looking into it &#8211; and that made all the difference in the case of Mr. Green.”</p>
<p>The Chronicle writer characterized Leitner’s statement as a “slam [against] prior district attorney administrations for the length of time the case stalled.” </p>
<p>The article mentions that another prisoner, someone named Allen Porter, was released from prison a few days before Green’s release. He had been imprisoned for 19 years. Lykos’ office had uncovered evidence of his innocence, too. </p>
<p>John Roberts is hardly a probable crusader against the modern, but by now deeply-rooted, culture among government lawyers in which they role-play as mechanically and mindlessly as, say, a lawyer representing a mob figure, or one representing BP. And in recent decades, unabashed sleaze is as much the purview of big-name law practice as it is some of the old-style ambulance chasers; Roberts surely knows that.</p>
<p>But unless his distain for the phenomenon of government lawyers as over-the-top-and-under-the-sewer-line litigators is limited to those who by dint of their very high office cannot hide under the radar, or whose opponents or victims just don’t matter to him, he may, however improbably, prompt a major change in the very nature of government law practice. And of what it means to represent “the people.”</p>
<p>As for Kagan, well, who knows? Liptak’s article is titled “Stints in Court May Yield Clues to Style.” Hopefully, those stints aren’t clues to her substance as a justice, as well.</p>

<p><strong>Misinterpreting History to Sell Eternal Mobilization</strong><br />Washington Post, July 30, 2010, Pg. 19<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/07/30/1754085/a-defense-budget-lesson-we-never.html">A Defense Budget Lesson We Never Learn</a>, Max Boot<br />Max Boot, Jeanne J. Kirkpatrick seat at Council on Foreign Relations, describes a litany of tragedies rooted in alleged demobilizations including post American Revolution and the War Between the States. Each example is a false conclusion designed to justify the US borrowing trillions to avoid such daunting fantasies.<br />I am a student of Korean conflict and the geo politics of the era. Boot ignores Douglas Mac Arthur warning that a land war on the Asian land mass is suicide, and that Mac Arthur demanded nuclear weapons to avoid such a bankrupting situation. At the time the US was not demobilized, it was planning for war in Europe against the Red Army’s WW II formations. That strategy sadly is being continued today. The father of the Task Force Smith retreat was Stalin hitting at the weakness. A few more percent of GDP to defend everywhere in the late 1940’s would have lost the Cold War to the Soviets.</p>
<p>The other error is Vietnam. Vietnam was lost for two reasons. The US fought in the wrong way, sending the WW II forces into a guerilla war which Mac Arthur had seen and warned against. And it was fought with allies who were as alien to the Vietnamese people as the US. A few more percent of GDP to mobilize to win in Vietnam and everywhere else would have bankrupted the US and the Soviets would have won in 1968.</p>
<p>Bringing in the Reconstruction “failures” after 1866 presents Mr. Boot contempt of the US constitution implying US military force should have occupied Georgia to make it better somehow. Should have been as successful as Afghanistan today.<br />Mr. Boot would not be happy until the war machine has bankrupted the US. He should consider the aim of national strategy, Santayana’s second famous quote: “Fanaticism consists in redoubling your effort when you have forgotten your aim.” What good is it to avoid another Task Force Smith if the country is bankrupt?“</p>
<p>As a balance to Boot read Andrew Bacevich: http://www.huffingtonpost.com/andrew-bacevich/the-end-of-military-histo_b_663548.html</p>
<p>Israel and the US are the only nations who continue to rely on the irrelevant tactic of eternal mobilization.</p>

<p><strong>The Non-Relationship Between Interest Rates and the Money Supply</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TFYLeJLMoUI/AAAAAAAAAVo/HkYdzxeWVjA/s1600/realmoney1.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TFYLeJLMoUI/AAAAAAAAAVo/HkYdzxeWVjA/s320/realmoney1.bmp"></a><br />Figure 1</p>
<p>The graph shows that all but one recession since 1948 was preceded by a big drop in the real money supply per person over the length of a year. The exception – July of 1953 – wasn’t much of an exception; the 12 month change in the real money stock per capita went negative in August of 1953 and remained negative throughout the length of that recession.</p>
<p>Now, I use real M1 per capita a lot in my posts; I think it’s a largely unused but very good (in part because it is largely unused) measure of monetary policy, and its one Michael Kanell and I use in <ital>Presimetrics</ital>. For instance, we discuss how it affects economic growth, and we look at how much real M1 per capita increased over the length of each administration. (Note – the change in real M1 per capita, like other measures of monetary policy, is under the control of the Federal Reserve, not the executive branch.)</p>
<p>But because it isn’t used much, every time I do use it, I find there is a bit of confusion. And because it is so useful, I think it is worth spending a bit of time covering it.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />I’d like to start with a question I get asked a lot, which will be the topic of this post: what sense does it make to use real M1 per capita (or any other measure of the money supply) as a way to monitor the Fed’s monetary policy? After all, what the Fed does is set interest rates, or rather, one interest rate in particular: the Federal Funds rate. And when it does that, the money supply gets set by default. A fair number of college seniors majoring in econ, when pressed, could probably tell you a story like this:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The Fed determines what the Federal Funds interest rate should be. If the Fed wants to reduce interest rates, it will create money out of thin air and use it to buy bonds. Because there is more money competing to buy bonds, the interest rate bonds have to pay falls. At the same time, the added money sloshing around becomes cheaper for anyone to borrow, whether they’re issuing bonds or not. On the flip side, if the Fed wants to raise interest rates, it sells bonds. That forces anyone else trying to sell bonds to raise interest rates to compete. Additionally, because the Fed retires the money it gets paid for the bonds it sells, that process reduces the amount of money available in the economy, making it harder to come by and hence more costly.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a nice story, and like many others that is taught in economics classes across the country, it works fine in theory. It may even apply in a lot of real world situations. As I will show below, however, it doesn’t have much if anything to do with the way the U.S. economy operates.</p>
<p>Now, I’ve got a lot of ground to cover today, and being charge of watching the newborn while the wife is out and about, I don’t have a whole heck of a lot of time, so whereas I’d normally be throwing up a lot of graphs to show what I mean, instead I’m going to tell a little story and then show you that the folks responsible for setting the money supply agree with the story.</p>
<p>Here’s the story: Americans like to shop, and they seem to really like to shop in December. (Apologies for the lack of a graph, but you can find one example of the data <a href="http://www.census.gov/retail/mrts/historic_releases.html">here</a>.) Shopping is easier when there’s more liquidity in the system – that is to say, when money is looser and easier to come by &#8211; so the Fed should be expected to loosen the real money supply somewhat to accommodate the end –of-year shopping season. On the other hand, as anyone who watches the news can tell you, the Fed doesn’t exactly move interest rates around in a way that would suggest any loosening around December each year with a subsequent tightening up early in the next year. Which means either: a) the Fed does nothing to accommodate the end –of-year shopping season or b) the money supply and the interest rates, at least within some not-so-narrow range, have very little to do with each other.</p>
<p>Now, if the Fed is trying to loosen the money spigot to help the shopping season along every year, it isn’t doing it with interest rates. Interest rates don’t seem to display much of a pattern when it comes to the calendar. You don’t hear anyone say, “I’m waiting until to December to refinance the house since rates are always lower then.”</p>
<p>What about real M1 per capita? Well, there we see a pattern. Using data from January of 1948 to December of 2008, we can construct 721 blocks made up of 12 consecutive months. The first of these blocks runs from January of 1948 to December of 1948, the second from February of 1948 to January of 1948, and so forth, until January of 2008 through December of 2008.</p>
<p>The graph below shows the percentage of these blocks in which each month had the highest real M1 per capita. For example, the percent of blocks for which the peak real M1 per capita for the block occurred in January is shown in the first bar, the percent of blocks for which the peak real M1 per capita for the block occurred in February is shown in the second bar, etc. So look what happens:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TFYLwVHT_KI/AAAAAAAAAV4/-Cu1x_OSDfY/s1600/realmoney2.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TFYLwVHT_KI/AAAAAAAAAV4/-Cu1x_OSDfY/s320/realmoney2.bmp"></a><br />Figure 2.</p>
<p>Clearly, by far, the real money supply per capita is looser in December than any other month, and by a degree well outside the range that anything resembling chance would support. The fact that January comes in second is probably a function of spillover from December – the Fed doesn’t always drain out the money supply as quickly as it might otherwise like.</p>
<p>So… to sum up what we have… the Fed has a reason to loosen the money supply in December. Interest rates don’t show any pattern that works with the Fed’s goals, but real M1 per capita does. This indicates that unless there’s some really big coincidence going on, interest rates and real M1 per capita do not move together and the Fed is/seems to be using real M1 per capita (or something very similar) to accomplish many of its liquidity goals.</p>
<p>While I tend to let data speak for itself, I’d like share a couple of quotes. Here’s the first</p>
<blockquote><p>Because of these difficulties in achieving a subtle response of the Federal funds rate to changes in the amount of borrowing, achieving the degree of reserve pressures specified in the directive has been interpreted since the late 1980s to mean creating conditions consistent with the FOMC’s desired Federal funds rate. That rate has generally been apparent to the banks; since 1994 it has been announced formally and in prior years it was clearly indicated through an open market operation. <bold>The rate has tended to move to the new, preferred level as soon as the banks knew the intended rate, with little or no change in the amount of borrowing allowed for when constructing the path for nonborrowed reserves (described below). </bold></p></blockquote>
<p>I bolded a key sentence in the above paragraph; it indicates that the Federal funds rate is set not by the buying and selling of bonds, as textbooks will tell us, but rather by the Fed’s wish. Since 1994, the Fed has announced its target rate, and the rate starts moving in that direction immediately upon the announcement, not waiting for open market operations. Prior to 1994, the target rate wasn’t announced, but banks tried to get figure out that target through statements made by Fed officials and head to that rate anyhow.</p>
<p>A second quote from the same source:</p>
<blockquote><p>A prominent seasonal factor affecting deposits is the buildup in balances to accommodate the extra transactions during the holiday period, stretching from late November to early January (and the sharp reversal during January). A shorter term seasonal pattern arises from the payment of social security benefits on the third of each month; most recipients allow their cash balances to rise initially, then gradually work down the deposits as they pay their bills. (The Treasury’s total cash position might show offsetting movements, but most Treasury cash is not subject to reserve requirements.3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This quote indicates that the Fed does, indeed, try to accommodate additional seasonal liquidity (including those in December I noted in Figure 2).</p>
<p>So, these quotes match the data I described and support my conclusion. Which is to say, I’ve found another heathen who refuses to accept the standard textbook monetary policy story about how the money supply and interest rates behave. So where do these quotes come from, you ask?</p>
<p>You’ll find the quotes I cited on pp. 141 – 142 and p. 142, respectively, of <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/education/addpub/monpol/chapter6.pdf">the chapter on Open Market Operations in a textbook on monetary policy produced by the New York Fed</a>. That is to say – the people directly responsible for the buying and selling of bonds on behalf of the Federal Reserve aren’t don’t seem to feel that their activities have anything to do with the setting of interest rates. But what does it say about the economics profession that the rest of us are under the misimpression that it does?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I’ll have at least one more post soon on real M1 per capita and its effect on the economy.</p>
<p>&#8212;<br />Data Sources</p>
<p>FRED, the Federal Reserve Database, was the source for most of the data used to compute real M1 per capita: <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/POP">population from 1952 to the present </a>, <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M1">M1 from 1958 on</a> and <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CPIAUCNS">M1 from 1958 on</a>.</p>

Note – the quarterly population figures were used to extrapolate monthly population for 1947 to 1952.</p>
<p>Finally, money stock figures were substituted in for M1 from 1947 to 1957. Those were copied by hand from this document at the</p>

<p>This will be a long post as it is not easy to explain how Italian politics got this way to foreigners.  First I will discuss recent developments.  Later I will discuss the characters in the commedia and history.</p>
<p>Until  this week, Silvio Berlusconi was, on paper, a very powerful  Prime minister with a large majority consisting of only two parties – the racist regionalist Lega Nord and the PDL a new party formed from the ex-post fascists and Forza Italia (yaaaay Italy) founded by Berlusconi.   The PDL doesn’t exist any more.   Berlusconi just expelled the cofounder – Gianfranco Fini last general secretary of an openly neofascist party and now President of the Camera de deputati (lower house of Parliament from now on “Camera”).   This is not a return to the past as Berlusconi has kept more than half of the ex-neo-fascists.    At the moment, Fini, however, has enough followers in the Camera to give the opposition a majority if he wants.  On paper a no confidence motion should pass. </p>
<p>So what will happen next ?   </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Well first everyone will go to the beach.  It’s August, Parliament doesn’t meet in August.  The breakup was scheduled to give a month of contrasting confident predictions before there is any actual vote.   There will be a lot of conflicting press releases.   </p>
<p>So what will happen in September ?  One possibility is that Berlusconi will be able to win the support of enough members of Parliament to have a new small majority.   He has announced the creation of 6 new positions of undersecretary with the obvious aim of offering them to MPs from tiny parties and MPs who have already switched party since being elected.  The resulting struggle in parliament will be difficult for Berlusconi.  It doesn’t help that to play against the referee and Fini can use his office to make the schedule as inconvenient as possible for Berlusconi.  Since the laws on which they disagree serve no purpose except to protect Berlusconi and friends from judicial investigations, Fini should enjoy heated debate.   </p>
<p>Berlusconi’s aim is to get the President of the Republic to call early elections.   It is reasonably likely that he and his remaining allies would win such elections.  Fini’s new mini-party “Futuro e …&#8221;  I have to check uhm … does not have any name recognition, and the number of Berlusconi haters willing to vote for an ex post neo-fascist is tiny.  The issue will be whether the Parliament should serve Berlusconi’s personal interests.  This has been the issue for decades and Berlusconi has won more elections than he has lost.   I have no idea why people vote for his parties – I have never heard anyone admit to have done so.    It’s just a fact that with a clear choice between Berlusconi and the law and the constitution, about half of Italians choose Berlusconi.</p>
<p>Berlusconi’s problem is that the President of the Republic is not quite like the Queen of England.  He is supposed to be non-partisan, but is not expected to obey the Prime Minister.  In particular, The President is supposed to call early elections only if it is absolutely impossible to find a majority in Parliament.  The current President, Giorgio Napolitano is a terminally moderate mild mannered ex-communist.   He has quarreled less with Berlusconi than either of the other Presidents who had to deal with him as Prime minister, but he sure won’t deviate a bit from the Constitution to help Berlusconi.  </p>
<p>Berlusconi, being Berlusconi, is likely to demand early elections and demand that he be caretaker prime minister during the campaign (this is what he did the last time he lost his majority in Parliament, although he also said the Parliament didn’t have the authority to fire him, because the constitution was rendered obsolete by a law passed in Parliament – I promise you I am not exaggerating or removing necessary context).    Berlusconi is not capable of pretending to respect the constitution or the principle of division of power.  In his struggle to get to an early election, he will make it absolutely clear that no Italian who gives a damn about the constitution, division of power, the Democratic tradition or elementary logic could possibly vote for him.  However, this has been absolutely clear for decades and he often wins elections.</p>
<p>My guess is that sooner or later, Berlusconi will get angry and resign – demanding that he be made caretaker prime minister and that there be early elections.   Since he still has a majority in the Senate, he will be able to make it impossible for anyone else to be Prime minister.  My guess is that he gets his early elections and the issues are how much contempt for constitutional democracy will he show while demanding them (probably lots) and how many Italians share that contempt (not an absolute majority but probably a plurality).  </p>
<p>Some politicians in the center left, including Bersani the general secretary of the Democratic Party (which makes the US Democratic party seem to be well organized) and Massimo d’Alema (a former prime minister) have made it clear that they will attempt to patch together a new majority in order to avoid an election.  This would require an agreement with the xenophobic, regionalist extremist Lega Nord whose leader just responded to a reporter’s question on the constitutional reform by showing his middle finger.   The proposed deal is to have a short lived majority which will change the electoral law back to a proportional system so there will never be a strong majority in Parliament and leaders of little parties with almost no support (or regional support like the Lega) will be able to block everything again.   I’m pretty sure that very few Italians find this effort less disgusting than I do and it makes me feel sick.   I will discuss why the hell these people are discussing obscene deals in public after I regain my composure (in my next post).</p>
<p>So why did Fini do it ?  Technically, Berlusconi broke with Fini expelling his followers from their joint party. However, this was clearly inevitable for months as Fini openly criticized Berlusconi.   Elisabetta Addis argues that the issue is who will lead the right after Berlusconi dies (note no hope that his political career will end before his life).   Slavishly following Berlusconi works fine (for those who can stand the humiliation) while he is alive, but is not the way to position oneself as a leader.   Fini has shown some dignity  and spine (also respect for his constitutional role but I’d guess that the center right voters are willing to forgive that).  However, the pile of ex allies of Berlusconi on the ash heap of Italian politics is very high (Dini, Mastella, Pievetti, Casini (more or less)).   </p>
<p>My personal guess is that it is very very hard for anyone with any self respect to deal with Berlusconi.  Berlusconi doesn’t hide the fact that he considers himself the boss.  He demands that everyone repeat his absurd lies about how he is not a crook, and it’s just that investigating magistrates all over Italy are out to get him.  </p>
<p>It is important that Berlusconi has been trying to use the parliament to protect himself and his friends from the latest judicial investigations of their many crimes  (I note I am writing this in Italy so it would be libel if I could not prove my accusation.  However, I would have no problem proving that Berlusconi has committed many  crimes just by referring to official sentences many of which conclude he is not to be declared guilty because of the statue of limitations, an amnesty, or the fact that he had earlier parliaments change the laws he broke after he broke them.  Please please sue me Silvio).</p>
<p>The President of the Camera (and the President of the Senate) are supposed to defend the constitutional prerogatives of those legislative bodies.  Berlusconi spits on constitutional prerogatives and makes it hard for Presidents of houses of Parliament to avoid totally humiliating themselves or breaking with him.  Notably the last time Berlusconi lost a majority in Parliament, the then President of the Camera Irene Pivetti was an early leader of the back bench and presidium revolt.    </p>
<p>The Presidents of the Camera or the Senate who have not broken with Berlusconi are incredibly spineless shameless worms even by the standards of followers of Berlusconi (dear judge, I mean that metaphorically and don’t claim that I can actually prove they are helminths, although in the case of Scongnamiglio  I’d be willing to try).</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>As I browsed through the news today it kind of struck me, not like a lightning bolt but more as an accumulation of blows, that capital was going for the final victory over labor. It was not just the realization that the corporatists and their enablers in both parties were willing to accept 9% plus unemployment long-term but offer no relief at all to the 99ers, but equally willing to accept an investment climate where employers simply will not hire even if they are sitting on piles of cash, because after all who knows and why should any individual employer take the first jump. But this article pushed me over the edge: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/30/AR2010073005722.html?hpid=moreheadlines">Employers shrink pay raises, focus increases more on top performers</a><br />
<blockquote>In other cases, employers can afford raises but are holding off to conserve cash in case the economy slips into another recession. They also are recognizing that they don&#8217;t have to offer pre-downturn-level raises because of an abundance of unemployed job applicants willing to work for less.</p>
<p>&#8220;The companies have the money to pay but they don&#8217;t need to pay it because the supply [of highly qualified unemployed people] is still there,&#8221; said Tim Namie, managing director of Manpower Professional&#8217;s Washington region.</p>
<p>Employers, Namie added, &#8220;are willing to roll the dice&#8221; that because of the tight job market, meager raises won&#8217;t prompt good workers to quit. And if the workers do leave, he said, employers figure they can find replacements willing to work for lower wages.</p></blockquote>
<p> Gone is even any pretense that wages are somehow magically tied to &#8220;marginal productivity&#8221;, nope we are reverting right back to 19th century industrial standards where labor is simply replaceable. Don&#8217;t want a job that barely pays now? Well screw you, we&#8217;ll just hire a homeless 99&#8217;er at 10% less, after all it will allow him to pay for a couple of months in a rooming house. These sons-a-bitches are betting they can roll the dice and have it come up &#8216;1888&#8217;. Well a funny thing happened in those years right before the turn of the 19th century when the Gilded Age was truly golden and Robber Barons were building mansions and founding Colleges, a certain segment of labor decided they weren&#8217;t going to take it anymore, and things got kind of messy for the capitalists. And a few decades later we had the following ballad going around: (lyrics under the fold).<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://randompottins.blogspot.com/2005/11/ballad-of-joe-hill.html">RandomPottins: blog of Charlie Pottins of the UK: Ballad of Joe Hill</a><br />
<blockquote>On November 19, 1915, as working men were being sent to slaughter each other for rival imperial powers, working class hero and songwriter Joe Hill was executed by firing squad in the state of Utah.</p>
<p>In 1925, Alfred Hayes wrote a poem about Joe Hill entitled &#8220;I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night&#8221;, but sometimes just called &#8220;Joe Hill&#8221;. Hayes&#8217;s lyrics were turned into a song in 1936 by Earl Robinson.<br />It has been sung by Paul Robeson and Pete Seeger, and by the Irish singer Luke Kelly. Probably the best known version today was sung and recorded by Joan Baez in 1969, and featured in the film by Joe&#8217;s fellow-Swede Bo Widerborg in 1971. Bob Dylan has said that Joe Hill&#8217;s story helped inspire him to write his own songs.</p>
<p>But the lyrics as sung have sometimes varied, as the ballad was passed down over the years, sung at benefit concerts, and meetings, around campfires or in pubs.</p>
<p>I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night,<br />Alive as you and me.<br />Says I &#8220;But Joe, you&#8217;re ten years dead&#8221;<br />&#8220;I never died&#8221; said he,<br />&#8220;I never died&#8221; said he.<br />&#8220;In Salt Lake, Joe,&#8221; says I to him,<br />him standing by my bed,<br />&#8220;They framed you on a murder charge,&#8221;<br />Says Joe, &#8220;But I ain&#8217;t dead,&#8221;<br />Says Joe, &#8220;But I ain&#8217;t dead.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Copper Bosses killed you Joe,<br />they shot you Joe&#8221; says I.<br />&#8220;Takes more than guns to kill a man&#8221;<br />Says Joe &#8220;I didn&#8217;t die&#8221;<br />Says Joe &#8220;I didn&#8217;t die&#8221;</p>
<p>And standing there as big as life<br />and smiling with his eyes.<br />Says Joe &#8220;What they can never kill<br />went on to organize,<br />went on to organize&#8221;</p>
<p>From San Diego up to Maine,<br />in every mine and mill,<br />where workers fight,<br />to defend their rights,<br />That&#8217;s where you find Joe Hill,<br />it&#8217;s there you find Joe Hill!</p>
<p>I dreamed I saw Joe Hill last night,<br />alive as you and me.<br />Says I &#8220;But Joe, you&#8217;re ten years dead&#8221;<br />&#8220;I never died&#8221; said he,<br />&#8220;I never died&#8221; said he.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not a revolutionary, but on the other hand I am not here to turn my back on the IWW (Wobblies) or Harry Bridges who as head of the ILA (Longshoremen) led the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.calisphere.universityofcalifornia.edu/themed_collections/subtopic4d.html">1934 San Francisco General Strike</a>. The New Deal overall can be seen as the result of a Great Compromise, Labor agreeing to maintain a system fundamentally based on and controlled by Capital in return for a fair share of resultant productivity. And with fits and turns that compromise and deal held up for 50 years. Until in the 1980s Capital decided that with a determined effort they could just roll back the clock a hundred years and tell labor to stuff it, to work or starve.</p>
<p>I mean it is one thing to tolerate high levels of unemployment, it is another to deliberately set out to exploit it in the way outlined by that WaPo article today. Which btw proceeded, without any apparent indignation, to point out that local workers in the DC area had it relatively easy, those workers outside the military-intelligence-national security sectors not even getting Beltway and Wall Street wage increases.</p>
<p>Look no one wants to see violence in the streets, but history shows that it is not only the capitalists that have 2nd amendment remedies. Joe Hill may have more life in him than they like.</p>
