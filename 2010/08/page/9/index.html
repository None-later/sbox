<p>David Altig has convinced the Wall Street Journal that hiring in the USA is low given the vacancy rate.   The basic fact is &#8220;Since the economy bottomed out in mid-2009, the number of job openings has risen more than twice as fast as actual hires,&#8221;</p>
<p>I remain totally unconvinced.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m not convinced by the basic claim of fact.   Basically I am certainly not convinced that there is anything unusual going on.   My sense is that this always happens early in an expansion *and* that there is always alarm about a shift in the Beveridge curve, and many rude things are said about the unemployed.</p>
<p>The WSJ reported the ratio of *the rate of change* of the vacancy rate to *the rate of change* in the hiring rate.  Under standard assumptions (and I do mean absolutely standard in the literature), if nothing odd were going on (and I do mean nothing at all) one would expect the rate of change of hiring to be half of the rate of change of vacancies.    Yes, the number given by the WSJ is exactly the number given by standard theoretical models *based on the assumption that there has been no shift in the hiring function*.  The standard assumption is that hiring is proportional to the product of the square roots of the unemployment rate and the vacancy rate.  That means, other things equal (which they sure aren&#8217;t) that log hiring would be a constant plus half of the log of the vacancy rate, so the rate of change of hiring would be half of the rate of change of the vacancy rate.</p>
<p>OK it is true that empirical estimates are different from standard assumptions and that, based on empirical estimates and holding other things equal, one would expect the rate of change of the rate of hiring to be 0.7 times the change rate of change of the vacancy rate.  Also unemployment has increased.</p>
<p>However, the WSJ is picking the point to which to compare.  One might also look at the rate of hiring the last time the vacancy rate was at the current level.    This might make some sense if one has doubts about the functional form of hiring as a function of vacancies and unemployment.  I&#8217;m sure that point was chosen to make the current hiring rate seem normal (I didn&#8217;t choose it).  I did perform the calculation.  There is no anomaly.  Hiring is 1.00 something times what one would expect given hiring the last time the vacancy rate was at the current level (hiring as gone up proportional to the unemployment rate ^0.3).  </p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/2whlysl">See this post by Andy Harless</a> (my calculation is in a comment)  </p>
<p>I assert that there is no evidence there.   The argument is based on the accidental theory that hiring is proportional to vacancies.  It absolutely isn&#8217;t.  Decades of data prove that it isn&#8217;t. There is nothing odd about the latest data which prove for the thousandth time that it isn&#8217;t.</p>

                                <p>We&#8217;re used to that line by now.  Ross Perot—one of the more prominent people who got rich due to government contracts—used it, Carly Fiorina and Meg Whitman are using it (while desperately hoping you don&#8217;t pay attention to how they ran Lucent/HP or eBay), and Aaron Sorkin even had Charles Grodin say it in <em>Dave</em>, if only to establish his Sensible Centrist cred.</p>

<blockquote>U.S. corporations have taken full advantage of low interest rates, going on a bond-issuing binge that has left them with tons of cash, which they appear to be holding largely as insurance against a new bout of financial turmoil, rather than spending on new hires. Nonfinancial companies were sitting on about $8.4 trillion in cash as of the end of March, or about 7% of all company assets, the highest level since 1963. Even before its [$1.5 billion at the bargain-basement interest rate of only 1%] bond issue, IBM had $12.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, which accounted for about 12% of all its assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>The WSJ is, of course, worried about The Savers:<br />
<blockquote>Meanwhile, though, savers are seeing some of the worst nominal returns in decades. As of June, the weighted average interest rate on deposits, money-market funds and other highly liquid investments stood at only 0.29%. Returns on riskier investments aren’t great, either: The average yield on near-junk bonds with maturities close to 30 years stood at about 5.9% this week.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/07/doug-henwood-questions-the-cbos-long-term-economic-forecast.html">said recently, in a slightly different context</a>, &#8220;I share [the] belief that these numbers ought to be higher. But I also think that I don&#8217;t have very good reasons to claim that I am right that they should be higher.&#8221;</p>
<p>Neither does the market.</p>
<p>And it&#8217;s not as if those companies were all saving during the Good Times. Indeed, they were arguably more poorly managed than the government. As <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/shareholder-value/">Floyd Norris noted almost two years ago</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Over the last four years, since the buyback boom began, from the fourth quarter of 2004 through the third quarter of 2008, companies in the S&#038;P500 showed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reported earnings: $2.42 trillion<br />Stock buybacks: $1.73 trillion<br />Dividends: $0.91 trillion</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The net flows there is <strong>-$220B</strong>, give or take a billion.  It&#8217;s spending roughly $1.10 for every dollar you earn.  And, to make matters worse, nearly twice as much was spent to make people go away (buybacks) than to reward loyalty (dividends).</p>
<p>If the government really were to be run like a successful business—the way the S&#038;P500 are run, the way IBM is run—they would be borrowing long-term right now at <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us/">that 2.82% 10-year or even than 4.00% 30-year rate</a>.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s good enough for IBM, it should be good enough for the U.S. Government.  The Mitt Romneys and Ross Perots have been telling us that for years; many we should listen?<br />

<p>If I had to pick out the two biggest sources of confusion about Social Security finance it would have to be one, the relation of the Trust Funds to Public Debt and two, the relation of Social Security surplus/deficits to Budget Scoring. At Angry Bear we have discussed the equation Debt Held by the Public + Intragovernmental Holdings = Public Debt enough that most regular readers probably get it. So today I want to lay out some definitions and explanations of &#8216;on-budget&#8217; directly from the source.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/concepts.pdf">Office of Management and Budget: Budget Concepts and Budget Process</a> This comes from Section 12 of OMB&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/Analytical_Perspectives">Analytical Perspectives on the Budget</a> which is the explanatory supplement to the Budget itself. The best guide to it is <a target='_blank"' href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/budget/fy2011/assets/list.pdf">List of Charts and Tables</a> where the lead number refers to the Section, with Section 5 being &#8216;Long Term Budget Outlook&#8217; (compare with CBO&#8217;s report with the same title), Section 6 being &#8216;Federal Borrowing and Debt&#8217;, and Section 27 &#8216;Trust Funds and Federal Funds&#8217;. Not exciting reads, but full of good to know information. Under the fold I have extracted from Section 12 &#8216;Budget Concepts and Budget Process&#8217; the portion discussing the difference between &#8216;On-budget&#8217; and &#8220;Unified Budget&#8221; &#8216;.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><a href="http://reddit.com/submit"> <img src="http://reddit.com/static/spreddit7.gif" alt="submit to reddit" border="0"></a> p. 134<br />
<blockquote>Every year since 1971, however, at least one Federal entity that would otherwise be included in the budget has been declared to be off-budget by law. Such off-budget Federal entities are federally owned and controlled, but their transactions are excluded, by law, from the rest of the budget totals, which are also known as “on-budget” totals. When a Federal entity is off-budget by law, its receipts, budget authority, outlays, and surplus or deficit are separated from all other (on-budget) receipts, budget authority, outlays, and surplus or deficit. The budget reflects the legal distinction between on-budget entities and off- budget entities by showing outlays and receipts for both types of entities separately.   </p>
<p>Although there is a legal distinction between on-budget and off-budget entities, there is no conceptual difference between the two. The off-budget Federal entities engage in the same kinds of governmental activities as the on- budget entities, and the programs of off-budget entities result in the same kind of outlays and receipts as on-budget entities. The “unified budget” reflects the conceptual similarity between on-budget and off-budget entities by showing combined totals of outlays and receipts for both types of entities.   </p>
<p>The off-budget Federal entities currently consist of the Postal Service Fund and the two Social Security Trust Funds: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance. Social Security has been classified as off-budget since 1986 and the Postal Service Fund has been classified as off-budget since 1990.  A number of other entities that had been declared off-budget by law at different times before 1986 have been classified as on-budget by law since at least 1985.</p></blockquote>
<p>So in examining Table 12-1 we can see that for all practical purposes &#8216;Off-budget&#8217; = Social Security (the Postal Service Fund showing little activity) while &#8216;Total&#8217; Surplus or Deficit = the so-called &#8220;Unified Deficit&#8221;, in quotes because in law there is no longer any such thing, it is just a very convenient reporting number.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help clear up some rampant terminological confusion, if not fuller explanations are available in the various sections of the Analytical Perspectives.</p>

<p>Bradley Birkenfeld, the UBS banker who opened the floodgates of information on the bank&#8217;s nefarious practices of aiding and abetting tax evasion, is currently in prison.  But he has also done a tell-all interview with the Global Post, a series that began on August 5.  See  Michael Bronner, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/europe/100724/swiss-banking-secrecy">Telling Swiss Secrets: A Banker&#8217;s Betrayal</a>, GlobalPost, Aug. 5, 2010.

<p>Remember the banking sequence in the Da Vinci Code movie/book.  A mundane world from the outside reveals itself to be a high-tech world of illusions, where bank vehicles can easily evade police inspectors and move clients beyond their range.  Birkenfeld&#8217;s description of the real Swiss bank is not so different&#8211;or if anything seems more surreal, since the bank even taught its bankers how to fool FBI and customs inspectors in order to move client assets around without the authorities knowledge. As the article notes:</p>
<p>The bank had held training sessions for cross-border bankers on how to elude FBI and U.S. Customs scrutiny when traveling with sensitive bank documents; how to obscure client information on PDAs and encrypted laptops; and various other evasive trade craft not usually associated with honest banking. Birkenfeld had the pilfered PowerPoints to prove it.</p>
<p>***<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The bank would admit to intentionally subverting U.S. tax laws and defrauding the U.S. government by sending dozens of unregistered bankers, Birkenfeld among them, to the United States on thousands of illegal trips to facilitate tax evasion schemes for wealthy U.S.-based clients — a fraud hiding as much as $20 billion in secret undeclared accounts and earning UBS up to $200 million a year in ill-begotten profits.

<p>Birkenfeld&#8217;s lifestyle, of course, was similar to the Wall Street titans with their million-dollar bonuses eating holes in their pockets.</p>
<p>He cultivated contacts among event organizers so he could swing VIP treatment for himself and his clients. &#8220;I just generally spent money the way I saw fit,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wouldn’t go out and buy somebody a Rolex, but I mean, if I spent $500 for a lunch I could justify it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Birkenfeld got paid, too: A starting salary of 180,000 Swiss francs (just over $170,000) plus an American-style bonus, which in his best year, he said, put him at one million Swiss francs in total compensation (about $946,000). When home from the road, Birkenfeld drove a BMW M5 and split time between a plush apartment in Geneva and a chalet in the shadow of the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps.  Id, Part II.</p>
<p>Birkenfeld&#8217;s defection was a game-changer.  The IRS got some names right away, thousands through an amnesty program that had clout because of the settlement with UBS which promised 4500 names, and with the Swiss Parliament&#8217;s decision in June, those thousands more.  Each account name provides tie-ins to other sources of information&#8211;Bahamian or Singaporean companies, bankers, lawyers, etc.  UBS is not the only bank whose secret operations will be exposed with the new information provided by those who came in under the IRS amnesty program&#8211;Credit Suisse and HSBC are also under investigation, as the article notes; and German authorities have purchased additional information on secret bank accounts, which led to German raids on Credit Suisse&#8217;s German branches in mid-July of this year.  This will provide still more information in months to come.</p>

<p>Projected growth in spending on the federal government&#8217;s big health and retirement programs&#8211;Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security&#8211;dominates the long-run budget outlook. If current policies continue, that spending is likely to grow significantly faster than the economy as a whole over the next few decades. By 2040, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects those outlays will rise to about 17 percent of gross domestic product (GDP)&#8211;  more than double their current share.  <br /><a target="_blank" href="http://cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=2517&#038;type=0">CBO report</a> ready for hawking in year 2000. </p>
<p>Was this before or after our deficit hawks started crowing in year 2000?</p>
<p>(a figure virtually identical to current estimates&#8230;oops&#8230;2010)</p>

<p>Perhaps if we dismiss the current hawks we could actually address the issue of deficits.</p>

<p>HEALTH CARE:<strong> The Durable Medical Equipment (DME) mess</strong></p>
<p>So you go to an orthopedic surgeon with a complaint of back pain, and the surgeon orders a lumbar back brace for support.</p>
<p>Can you stop at a counter and buy the brace on the way out the door? Probably not. <br />Years ago some members of Congress (Stark, Waxman, et.al.) thought it would be harmful if physicians profited from their prescriptions, but not harmful for others to do so, and thus has flourished a huge DME industry, ranging from hospitals and national chain pharmacies to mom-and-pop operations. (When I ran ortho centers we subbed out DME, too much hassle and compliance risk.)</p>
<p>Some DME providers get greedy and there has been a significant amounts of fraud in this area, most recently dealing with the ubiquitous motorized wheelchairs and power chairs of television fame.</p>
<p>But the latest DME fraud trend is really disturbing. DME fraud is being committed by phony &#8220;providers&#8221; who tend to be involved with organized crime, immigrant organized crime, computer hackers and identity thieves. These businesses do not exist, have no customers, provide no merchandise and steal billions from the feds with phony billings. Reading the indictments is enlightening.</p>
<p>(A few years ago nearly 50% of all of the diabetic supplies FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY were being billed from Miami &#8211; Dade County. Huh? Impossible of course. Miami appears to be a hot bed for immigrant crime.)</p>
<p>The feds caught on somewhat and set up a task force in southern Florida, and now are using the task force in Houston and possibly elsewhere.</p>
<p>Something here aggravates me. Getting a physician Medicare ID number, or adding a physician to an established group, takes a lot of time and a lot of paperwork, even though the physician is licensed and board certified. Apparently though any ambitious criminal can get a DME provider number with almost no hassle and start firing in billings. After a few months the operation closes down, takes the cash and billing starts for a new phony provider. </p>
<p>Medicare needs better management.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Exactly a month ago I put up a post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/07/if-social-security-annual-report.html">If a Social Security Annual Report Vanishes into the Forest</a> noting that not only was the Report months overdue but that nobody seemed to notice or care that there was no official announcement about the reasons for the delay or a new release date. The date that had been floated back in April was June 30th, then later some were saying &#8216;July&#8217; and then when July rolled around word around the Capitol was &#8216;August&#8217;. But nobody who knew anything was talking on the record. Then last week of all papers it was the Spokane Spokesman-Review that reported August 5th. But that news was only semi-officially confirmed this week when it was announced that AEI was having a briefing on the Report on Friday the 6th (today) and NASI was having a bigger event on Monday the 9th. But as for any official announcement there was nothing, not at SSA, nor at Treasury or HHS or Labor. Nor was the Report up on the web Thursday morning. It wasn&#8217;t until an hour before official Report release that Labor issued a news release with a link to the pdf of the Report. Well I was ready, a live link to it was up here at 11:22 Eastern, beating the official time by 38 minutes. But all of this leaves this question. Why the secrecy? Three Cabinet Secretaries and the Commissioner of Social Security were scheduled to release a public Report that had implications for every worker and retiree in the country and yet no one knew nothing.</p>
<p>Well the Report appeared and proceeded to make about as little noise as it did when in vanished into the woods, as I type a search on &#8216;2010 Social Security Report&#8217; turns up no MSM links in the top ten, unless you consider HuffPo MSM, and two of the top six results are to my posts here. Now Heritage and the Washington Times (which I don&#8217;t consider MSM) had what appear to be canned pieces up claiming that the Report confirmed their gloomy views but didn&#8217;t seem to address the actual numbers but for the most part there is very little coverage.</p>
<p>Now you can call me a cynic but some of this secrecy  and effective non-coverage may stem from the fact that the Report did not match the current narrative of &#8216;Crisis&#8217;. Instead Trust Fund depletion remained pegged at 2037, the date that cash surpluses vanish moved from 2016 to 2015 while the 75 year actuarial gap actually  dropped significantly from 2.00% to 1.92% putting it right back to 2001 levels. Meaning that a decade of &#8216;Crisis&#8217; has gone by with no action at all and Social Security emerges unchanged. Which leaves all the &#8220;we can&#8217;t afford to wait!&#8221; &#8220;delay will only make the cost larger and more abrupt!!&#8221; folk with a little egg on their faces. Social Security-still not broke.</p>
<p>More notes and an interesting graph under the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFw96m_X0gI/AAAAAAAAAY4/Sd4QJkn8vGk/s1600/2010+Fig+IV.B3+TF+Ratios.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFw96m_X0gI/AAAAAAAAAY4/Sd4QJkn8vGk/s400/2010+Fig+IV.B3+TF+Ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />For those joining this party late the &#8216;Trust Fund Ratio&#8217; is the Trust Fund balance expressed as a percentage of cost in any even year with the offical target being a TF Ratio of 100, meaning one year of reserves. This is called by the Trustees &#8216;actuarial balance&#8217;. Although we generally talk about THE Social Security Trust Fund, there are actually two, the OAS (Old Age/Survivors) and the DI (Disability) Trust Funds. In this figure OAS is the dark line and DI the light one. Additionally though we also tend to talk about Social Security going deplete in some future year or being able to pay out some percentage of benefits at that date in doing so we are generally referring to what the Trustees call the &#8216;Intermediate Cost Alternative&#8217; in this figure denoted as &#8216;II&#8217;. However they also give us two other Alternatives, a more pessimistic one called &#8216;High Cost&#8217; here &#8216;III&#8217; and a more optimistic one called &#8216;Low Cost&#8217; here &#8216;I&#8217;.  Low Cost and High Cost are fairly artificial in construction as each takes each of the variables that together determine solvency and varies them in the same direction, either better for solvency in the case of Low Cost or worse for High Cost. Since in practice it is not likely that every economic and demographic variable will move in the same direction in the same magnitude these two alternatives have to be regarded as being on the extremes of the probability spread. On the other hand this depends crucially on whether Intermediate Cost has in fact captured the true mean for each variable, if Intermediate Cost can be shown to be on the whole too pessimistic then Low Cost outcomes become more probable, and of course the converse is true. But that will have to be the subject of future posts.</p>
<p>A very common claim about Social Security is that there is no way that we can grow out of &#8216;crisis&#8217;. Well this figure puts that claim in doubt, because while Low Cost may not be totally likely it is at least possible and if it comes about OAS projects to never have a TF Ratio lower than 300, and since the target is only 100 can be said to give a result of &#8216;over-funded&#8217;, if it seems to be coming about then the policy question in the year 2020 will begin to revolve around when to cut FICA and by how much to get that tail pointing closer to 100 than to 450 and rising as it leaves the projection period, Because oddly enough an over-funded Trust Fund is in its own way a bigger threat to Social Security long-term than an under-funded one. (I can point to some older posts on this if anyone cares).</p>
<p>Which brings us to an important point. While it may well be that Low Cost is unlikely, it is not an optimal outcome anyway, instead the sweet spot is somewhere between I and II in this figure and to get there we don&#8217;t have to hit every number of Low Cost, just enough of them in the right magnitudes to pull II&#8217;s tail up so that it intersects 100 at the end of the projection period or at least dips below actuarial balance (the same thing) as far in the future as possible. And many of those numbers are susceptible to deliberate policy choices. For example Social Security outcomes improve with higher immigration and higher fertility, and since immigrants, at least those from developing countries, tend to be more fertile sticking to a policy of closed borders, while maybe appealing to younger Teabaggers in the here and now, plays a certain amount of hell with their future retirement outlook. Equally Social Security solvency is positively correlated with more employment and higher real wage although the effect is offset by the fact that the increased income also results in increased costs in the form of higher benefit checks. But from the perspective of the worker this is all good, it means that any future percentage cut in benefits would be from that much higher a baseline, which means that solvency effects aside a deliberate policy targeting employment and real wage will result in a better Social Security outcome. (Minimum wage increase anyone?). Similarly improvements in productivity, even if they don&#8217;t pass through perfectly to Real Wage, increase affordability by holding down the percentage of GDP needing to be devoted to Social Security, or perhaps assisting us to achieve Prof. Jamie Galbraith&#8217;s appeal to enhance Social Security benefits rather than cut them.</p>
<p>Which suggests  a second prong to the NW Plan. The first prong simply assumes Intermediate Cost numbers and programs in the revenue increases needed to target actuarial balance, the second would be to advocate for policies that make some or all of those tax increments unnecessary. The right answer is not to just passively accept our fate and schedule benefit cuts prematurely, the numbers needed to substantially cut the payroll gap even in the absence of tax increases are by no means out of reach, add a few tenths of a point to productivity and a good deal of &#8216;crisis&#8217; simply vanishes.</p>

The drop in employment stemmed largely from the layoffs of census workers as private sector employment rose some 71,000 as compared to 31,000 last month.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwNJt61nHI/AAAAAAAABRY/daQw9V-irzg/s1600/Clipboard01-EMP.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwNJt61nHI/AAAAAAAABRY/daQw9V-irzg/s320/Clipboard01-EMP.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Compared to the historic norm employment  employment gains this cycle has been extremely weak, but it is stronger than in the jobless recoveries of the 1990s and 2000s.</p>

The<br />compound growth three month growth rate slipped to 3.0% from a 3.5% growth rate last month.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwOU1jDXyI/AAAAAAAABSQ/zuQM0Cx2yP0/s1600/Clipboard04-EMP.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwOU1jDXyI/AAAAAAAABSQ/zuQM0Cx2yP0/s320/Clipboard04-EMP.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Average hourly earnings growth continued to slow as the year over year gain was 1.75%.  Because hours worked are expanding the weekly wage gain rose to 3.0%.  With zero inflation in the first half of the year this means that real weekly wages are rising moderately.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwNVxwnijI/AAAAAAAABRg/2qAIuFL36VM/s1600/Clipboard02emp.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TFwNVxwnijI/AAAAAAAABRg/2qAIuFL36VM/s320/Clipboard02emp.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />This gain in real weekly earnings has been reflected in the single most important determinant of real consumer spending, real disposable income excluding transfers.  The year over year change in this measure just turned positive for the first time this cycle.</p>
