<p>Update: Rdan here  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.parade.com/news/intelligence-report/archive/100808-hey-big-spenders.html">Take the quiz now&#8230;hey big spenders</a></p>
<p><strong>Status Report on Presimetrics</strong></p>
<p>The Intelligence Report column in Parade Magazine, the newspaper that appears in Sunday newspapers across the country, wrote a short quiz based on Presimetrics.  It will appear in this Sunday&#8217;s issue.  </p>
<p>Michael Kanell and I will log in to the <a href="http://www.parade.com/news/intelligence-report/quiz/presidential-quiz.html">quiz&#8217;s site</a> a few times on Sunday and (if all goes well) once more Monday to answer questions anyone might have about the book.  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, I just got a copy of the book, and it looks very nice.  I believe they&#8217;ll be shipping copies of the book to bookstores within days.  Additionally, the publisher is working on a number of other media appearances.  </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I spent the last hours of last night watching the PBS &#8220;Human Experience&#8221; episode on the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/ccc/player/">Civilian Conservation Corps</a>.  A few million people put to work: for long hours, living in Army barracks, with all but $5 of their pay having to be sent home every week.  Gosh, sounds just right as part of <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2009/03/20/just-when-i-thought-i-was-out/">FDR&#8217;s Conservative First 100 Days</a>.</p>
<p>The documentary makes a couple of things clear: (1) it kept about 3,000,000 people busier than they would have been otherwise* and (2) when the time finally came to enter WW II, those three million were in better shape than they would have been, and were prime volunteers without whom results might have been very different.</p>
<p>Even independent of what it produced, what&#8217;s not to like? No wonder it was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_Conservation_Corps">the most popular Depression-Era program</a>.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t it seem like something the new Administration might have wanted to emulate?  Well, it did&#8230;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In late March of 2008, Neil Maher, guest-blogging at The Edge of the American West, was clear: even as the crisis was growing, <a href="http://edgeofthewest.wordpress.com/2008/03/31/it%E2%80%99s-time-for-a-new-and-improved-ccc/">a New and Improved CCC</a> would prepare the U.S. for the next fifty years, even as the old one prepared it for the fifty that followed it.<br />
<blockquote>Brazil has recently begun looking back to Franklin Roosevelt’s CCC to help solve that country’s economic and environmental problems&#8230;The goal of Brazil’s CCC-like program, which the Nature Conservancy helped initiate, is to plant one billion trees over the next ten years across the country’s Atlantic Forest. Rather than funding the program by increasing taxes, Brazil will rely on novel market mechanisms including the sale of sequestration vouchers on the international carbon market, obtained through the program’s reforestation efforts, as well as the collection of water use fees in the reforested regions. Similar tree-planting programs reminiscent of Franklin Roosevelt&#8217;s CCC are also now operating in China along the Yangtze River and through Wangari Maathai&#8217;s Greenbelt Movement in Kenya. Even war-torn Afghanistan has created its own &#8220;Afghan Conservation Corps.&#8221;</p>
<p>The United States needs to follow suit, and the upcoming election is a good place to start. Hillary Clinton openly calls for the creation of a “green economy” centered on a cap and trade system for carbon emissions that will help create five million new jobs. Barack Obama wants to develop a program that rewards those who plant trees, restore grassland, or undertake farming practices that capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Even John McCain, who claims fellow Republican and early conservationist Teddy Roosevelt as his hero, proposes to limit carbon emissions as president. A new and improved Civilian Conservation Corps, one which enrolls women as well as men and focuses its efforts on fighting global warming, would allow all of these candidates to turn campaign rhetoric into post-election reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>Catching up on my blog reading today, I came across <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/1880/five-myths-about-bush-tax-cuts-and-scourge-stimulus">a recent Andrew Samwick post</a> in which he reposted a link from December of 2008—just after the election—to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/07/us/politics/07radio.html">this NYT article</a>:<br />
<blockquote>President-elect Barack Obama promised Saturday to create the largest public works construction program since the inception of the interstate highway system a half century ago as he seeks to put together a plan to resuscitate the reeling economy&#8230;.</p>
<p>Mr. Obama’s remarks showcased his ambition to expand the definition of traditional work programs for the middle class, like infrastructure projects to repair roads and bridges, to include new-era jobs in technology and so-called green jobs that reduce energy use and global warming emissions. &#8220;We need action — and action now,&#8221; Mr. Obama said in an address broadcast Saturday morning on radio and YouTube&#8230;.</p>
<p>It would cover a range of programs to expand broadband Internet access, to make government buildings more energy efficient, to improve information technology at hospitals and doctors&#8217; offices, and to upgrade computers in schools.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is unacceptable that the United States ranks 15th in the world in broadband adoption,&#8221; Mr. Obama said. &#8220;Here, in the country that invented the Internet, every child should have the chance to get online.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Twenty months later, I can&#8217;t even find an outline of this in the policies proposed or passed.</p>
<p>Whither the New CCC?  Whither preparation for competing with the Chinese in the mid- and late 21st century? Whither developing job skills to ensure that broadband isn&#8217;t just <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/must-read/google-verizon-deal-end-internet-we-know-it">something Google sells to Verison</a>?  Who will be the people ready to maintain and repair solar cells?<br />

</p>
<p>*Let&#8217;s face it: it&#8217;s a difficult job, spent away from home and family, for basically room and board and a (very) little <em>l&#8217;argent de poche</em>.  Not the type of job you keep if you get a letter from your spouse saying that the local Woolworth&#8217;s is paying $1.00/hour.</p>

<p>Matthew Yglesias has a new argument for encouraging exports of manufactures.  I am not at all convinced.  He seems to be asserting that employment in wholesaling and transportation follows production not sales and so is increased by manufacturing for export.  I really doubt that.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>

<p>I saw Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm at CAPAF earlier today and she naturally went on at some length about the importance of preserving manufacturing employment. In the course of doing so she very briefly made the more nuanced point that manufacturing activity supports considerable employment in manufacturing-related services. &#8230; Given the rate of productivity growth in manufacturing, there’s no plausible volume of exports that’s going to sustainably increase manufacturing employment. But that doesn’t mean that exporting more goods won’t boost employment:<br />&#8230; during the pre-recession slump in manufacturing employment—a period in which manufacturing output was growing thanks to increases in productivity—that employment in services related to manufacturing was going up. What kind of services? “Upstream” services are &#8230;.  “Downstream” services are wholesaling and transportation. When output collapses, this dries up, but if we had an export-driven increase in output we’d see increases in these fields even if manufacturing employment per se doesn’t really rise. </p>
<p>I am very not convinced </p>
<p>Downstream Services are wholesaling and transport.  Hmmm isn&#8217;t retailing downstream ?  That would be a problem wouldn&#8217;t it ?  You know that retailing of exports happens over there.  I do not believe that a significant fraction of the downstream services are transport and wholesaling for export.  How could that be ?  It can&#8217;t take that much labor to take things from a factory to a port and then the container is just put on a ship.  </p>
<p>I suspect that most employment in transporting and wholesaling manufactured goods is, like retailing, transporting and wholesaling goods made anywhere to be sold in country.  Getting the goods to the store is labor intensive.  That doesn&#8217;t depend on whether the good is domestically made or imported.  </p>
<p>You might be able to convince me that you are not totally utterly completely wrong by looking at huge swings of the dollar and huge swings of net merchandise exports.  Hmmm I will check myself.</p>
<p>Well this is very crude, <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/suppl/empsit.ceseeb1.txt">employment by very broad sector from the bls</a>.  Employment in &#8220;trade, transportation and utilities&#8221; roughly corresponds to Yglesias&#8217;s numbers for &#8220;downstream services.&#8221;</p>
<p>I look at the 80s a period of a strongly overvalued dollar and a ballooning trade deficit.  I find employment in &#8220;Trade Transportation and utilities&#8221; grew more than 20% while employment in manufacturing declined.  In the 90s employment in Trade Transportation and Utilities grew less while manufacturing employment was roughly stable. This is crude but there is no evidence for your odd theory that exporting implies lots of jobs in trade and transportation.</p>
<p>Any thoughts ? Anyone ? Rusty ?</p>

<p>Well surprising to me anyway. The 2009 Social Security Report projected a 75 year actuarial gap for combined OASDI of 2.00%. Between the structural change involved in changing the valuation period (as 2009 drops off and a new year 75 is added) and the current recession cutting into revenues I fully expected this gap to edge up. Instead it was revised down to 1.92% putting it back to where it was in 2001. Why the change? Well the following table breaks it down. As always, click to enlarge.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr5AygPKZI/AAAAAAAAAYo/mbaa_vEJGVs/s1600/2010+II.D2+Reasons.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr5AygPKZI/AAAAAAAAAYo/mbaa_vEJGVs/s400/2010+II.D2+Reasons.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Well it wasn&#8217;t because they gamed future economic and demographic projections (except one) the OACT left ultimate numbers unchanged. There were some changes in initial numbers due to high unemployment, but those were offset by changes in the Methods and Programmatic Data. Instead the biggest change is the +.14 due to Legislation offset by the -.06 due to the Valuation period to give our net change of +.08.</p>
<p>And what legislation was that? Health Care Reform. The OACT calculates that HCR will result in dollars being shifted from employer paid health insurance to wages after the Exchanges et al are fully in operation. This seems to rest on an argument from economic theory that has employers setting total compensation at some rate established by the underlying fundamentals and then backing out health care costs from that, with the idea that savings in the latter simply means more of the total flowing to wages. Well personally I have never been convinced by that argument, but in that I am in a decided minority, in particular most of the professional economists I know endorse it. So I guess I&#8217;ll just let it stand.</p>
<p>What are the policy implications of a steady state or dropping year over year 75 year actuarial gap. Well some thoughts under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Well the first thing it does is put the &#8220;We can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8221; folk in their place. Take the following table showing actuarial gap by Report year.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr_MxECZpI/AAAAAAAAAYw/kKdGO4k_JAs/s1600/2010+VI.B1+Actuarial+Balance+by+year.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/TFr_MxECZpI/AAAAAAAAAYw/kKdGO4k_JAs/s400/2010+VI.B1+Actuarial+Balance+by+year.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />This table is found on page 153 and is accompanied by text explaining the specific changes that went into adjusting the number, but if we back up a bit we can see that after a fairly drastic surge between 1993 and 1994 the actuarial gap has, despite any attempt to adopt policy to address it, has stayed remarkable steady fluctuating around a mean of 2.0%. This is a little odd for two reasons, one is that the change in actuarial period represented here should have something like 0.7% to the accumulated total, that instead if anything that the trend has been modestly down suggest there is something in the model which is too pessimistic, and that this factor or factors, whatever they are, is enough to offset the accumulated change due to valuation period.</p>
<p>But even without trying to identify those factors we can come to a clear empirical conclusion: based on these numbers the clearly superior approach to Social Security (and the last entitlements commission-Kerrey-Danforth) in 1994 has been a plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217;. Addressing Social Security in 1994 by cutting benefits or raising taxes would have been a straight give away by everyone who was either a worker or retiree in those years, instead all beneficiaries received full benefits and all workers got the equivalent of a 2%+ tax cut. And based on the results of the 2010 Report &#8216;Nothing&#8217; was also a perfectly fine plan for 2009, despite all the hysteria stirred up by &#8220;vanishing surplus, YEARS ahead of schedule, we got to act RIGHT NOW&#8221; the final numbers just show no support for that at all.</p>
<p>Now for those of us who want to avoid any future cut in benefits there is merit in putting in place a contingency plan that would have us move when the numbers actually support it. But those who want to use some theoretical future cut in benefits to justify cutting benefits even sooner are asking workers for a give-away where there is no evidence they need to sacrifice themselves in the face of something that doesn&#8217;t appear to be a crisis at all.</p>
<p>Just as supporters claimed when Bush took a run at Social Security in 2004-2005. Five years later and we are right back at 1.92% of payroll.</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Linda Beale</strong><br />Excerpt from <strong>Ataxingmatter</strong> </p>
<p>The post in its entirety can be found at Linda&#8217;s Ataxingmatter <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/08/health-care-reform-the-virginia-opposition-given-standing-in-federal-district-court.html">Health Care Reform: the Virginia opposition given standing in federal district court</a>:</p>
<p>The judge states that the &#8220;central issue&#8221; in the case is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/08/02/Va%20ruling.pdf">Virginia&#8217;s interest</a> in upholding it&#8217;s &#8220;health care freedom act&#8221;&#8211;a declaration that Viriginia citizens do not have to buy insurance (in spite of the federal mandate).  As Jack Balkin so ably comments (see link below), the judge&#8217;s acceptance of this argument opens the way for states to challenge anything in the Internal Revenue Code by passing a declaratory resolution indicating that they don&#8217;t think it should be treated as constitutional or that conflicts with the particular provision in question.</p>
<p>As for the commerce clause power, the court also treats Wickard v. Fillburn (the Supreme Court case that held that growing wheat for one&#8217;s own use is subject to the commerce clause power) as not decisive on this issue.  Virginia claims that the decision not to purchase is not an economic act, compared to the decision to purchase or the decision to grow one&#8217;s own as a substitute for purchase.  That distinction does not appear to have any merit.  The decision not to purchase insurance and the decision not to purchase wheat are surely similar decisions to try to avoid the commercial flow by managing on one&#8217;s own.  Yet surely one&#8217;s interaction with the health care system is much more clearly a question of interstate commerce even than one&#8217;s ability to grow wheat at home and avoid the purchase of wheat&#8211;even people who pretend to provide their own health care at home will at one time or another impinge on the health care system in all likelihood, whether because they are in a transportation accident, an accident outside their home, a work injury or illness, or taking advantage of free medical care such as vaccinations, etc.    The judge however, concludes that the precedent is inconclusive and that the government has failed to show that the state has not stated a valid commerce clause claim.</p>
<p>Finally, the judge follows Virginia in conflating the Commerce Clause and Taxation Power arguments.  It accepts the idea that if &#8220;economic inactivity&#8221; (which is a misnomer, since it is clearly economic activity to provide one&#8217;s own care, just as imputed income from providing one&#8217;s own home is real economic activity) is not accessible under the commerce clause, then it shouldn&#8217;t be reachable under the tax power.  This is an extraordinarily poorly reasoned section of the opinion.</p>
<p>For a thoughtful and articulate analysis of the standing issues, see Jack Balkin&#8217;s blog, <a target="_blank" href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2010/08/judge-preserves-constitutional.html">Judge Preserves Constitutional Challenge to Individual Mandate</a> (Aug. 2, 2010) [hat tip Ellen Aprill and the Tax Prof discussion group].</p>
<p>Allowing this case to go forward leaves health reform in turmoil.  It could take years for the different cases to wend their way through the courts, and ultimately the Supreme Court will likely have to rule. </p>

<p><strong>Beverly Mann</strong>, whose expertise is in certain areas of constitutional law and federal-court jurisdiction at the <a target="_blank" href="http://annarborist.blogspot.com/"><strong>Annarborist</strong></a>, and who guests at Angry Bear, notes on the same topic (lifted from an e-mail to me):</p>
<blockquote><p>Yeah.  I read Lyle Denniston’s article about that opinion on Scotusblog a couple hours ago, and this sentence really strikes me: “‘While this case raises a host of complex constitutional issues,’ the judge wrote, ‘all seem to distill to the single question of whether or not Congress has the power to regulate — and tax — a citizen’s decision not to participate in interstate commerce’ — that is, a private decision not to buy health insurance.”</p>
<p>Actually, the argument that that part of the legislation is within Congress’s purview under the Commerce Clause is that a citizen’s decision not to participate in interstate commerce—that is, a private decision not to buy health insurance—actually is not a decision not to participate in interstate commerce but instead (for many people at least) a decision to participate in interstate commerce by having others pay their emergency medical bills.  If they are, say, injured in a car accident and treated at a hospital and then cannot pay their medical bills, the public pays those bills.  </p>
<p>The problem with the judge’s argument is that people do not decide whether to have a serious medical emergency.  When they do have one, and they receive major medical treatment, there is a bill for that. </p></blockquote>

<p>Hot off the press. PDF of the 2010 Social Security Report: http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2010/tr10.pdf</p>
<p>News Release: http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee10-pr-alt.pdf HTML version: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee10-pr.htm">Social Security Board of Trustees: Long-Range Financing Outlook Remains Unchanged</a> Boy that title blew me away, as did the initial numbers:<br />
<blockquote>The Social Security Board of Trustees today released its annual report on the financial health of the Social Security Trust Funds and the long-range outlook remains unchanged.  The combined assets of the Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Funds will be exhausted in 2037, the same as projected last year.  The Trustees also project that program costs will exceed tax revenues in 2010 and 2011, be less than tax revenues in 2012 through 2014, and then permanently exceed tax revenues beginning 2015, one year earlier than estimated in last year’s report.  The worsening of the short-range outlook for the Social Security Trust Funds is due in large part to the recent economic downturn. </p>
<p>In the 2010 Annual Report to Congress, the Trustees announced:</p>
<p>The projected point at which the combined Trust Funds will be exhausted comes in 2037 – the same as the estimate in last year’s report. At that time, there will be sufficient tax revenue coming in to pay about 78 percent of benefits.<br />The projected point at which tax revenues will fall below program costs comes in 2010.  Tax revenues will again exceed program costs in 2012 through 2014 before permanently falling below program costs in 2015 &#8212; one year sooner than the estimate in last year’s report.<br />The projected actuarial deficit over the 75-year long-range period is 1.92 percent of taxable payroll &#8212; 0.08 percentage point smaller than in last year’s report.<br />Over the 75-year period, the Trust Funds would require additional revenue equivalent to $5.4 trillion in present value dollars to pay all scheduled benefits.<br />“The impact of the current economic downturn continues to be felt by the Social Security Trust Funds,” said Michael J. Astrue, Commissioner of Social Security.  “The fact that the costs for the program will likely exceed tax revenue this year is not a cause for panic but it does send a strong message that it’s time for us to make the tough choices that we know we need to make.  I applaud President Obama for his creation of the Deficit Commission so we can start the national discussion needed to ensure that Social Security remains a foundation of economic security for our children and grandchildren.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>TomDispatch regular Ann Jones approaches Afghanistan and the American war effort from quite a different perspective. She’s proven a rarity in the way she’s reported back to us in these years. She arrived in Kabul in 2002, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, to work with Afghan women on their problems. Unlike almost any other American who wrote about the experience, she embedded herself in an Afghan world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ann Jones points to many of the problems with COIN and the last nine years in her narrative in this article&#8230;worth a read and some thinking.</p>

<p>HEALTH CARE thoughts: <strong>Integration Speeds Forward</strong></p>
<p> Among those who ponder the operational aspects of health care reform, there is strong sentiment for more use of Integrated Delivery Systems (IDS) in delivering health care.</p>
<p>This is hardly a new concept, but it may well be the concept of the future. </p>
<p>My focus is largely on physician integration although there are other aspects, but the docs are the really big issue, as they drive admissions and order testing.</p>
<p> The first big IDS wave occurred in the early to mid-90s, as physicians and hospitals tried various medical service organization (MSO) models; essentially the hospital owned the physician practices. Many of these deals were disasters, some worked, some evolved into something that worked.</p>
<p>The idea is that if a central entity (an insurer, a hospital, or a hospital network) owns and coordinates services there will better care coordination and cost savings. </p>
<p>The successful integrations so far have largely focused on family practice, internal medicine and ob-gyn (the OBs assistance with malpractice premiums and 24/7 coverage issues).</p>
<p>An interesting change is surfacing, the acceptance of specialists and surgeons into IDS models. Historically there has been a great deal of friction between these docs and the hospitals.</p>
<p>Why the change? Fear of dire economic consequences of staying in a traditional group practice model. Preliminary numbers from the 6/30/2010 residency class is that for the first time, a majority may opt for IDS employment rather than group practice. There are also reports that young docs are more concerned with life balance issues than previous generations.</p>
<p> So, any problems?</p>
<p>Hospitals are notoriously bad at managing physician practices, physician contracts must be structured carefully, physician productivity sometimes drops off with a steady paycheck, and the process of merging practices and/or converting ownership is a great deal of complex work at no small cost. Also, making this work in rural areas is tough.</p>
<p>Biggest question, will IDS on a large scale really cut costs? Or just reshuffle the deck chairs?</p>
