                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>A little over a year ago I put up the following map from  Cordesman and Toukan&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://csis.org/files/media/csis/pubs/090316_israelistrikeiran.pdf">Study on a Possible Israeli Strike on Iran’s Nuclear Development Facilities</a> </p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SlI4Sv5Au6I/AAAAAAAAAQs/3gHUDZn9X8E/s1600-h/Bomb+Routes.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SlI4Sv5Au6I/AAAAAAAAAQs/3gHUDZn9X8E/s400/Bomb+Routes.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A year later and this issue is back in the headlines and specifically in association with the publication by the uber-Likudnik Jeffrey Goldberg&#8217;s article in the Atlantic tomorrow called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1969/12/the-point-of-no-return/8186/">The Point of No Return</a> which essentially argues that the U.S. should bomb Iran and start a third mid-East war basically to save Israel the trouble of doing it itself. So maybe it is time to revisit Cordesman-Toukan in light of the current withdrawal schedule from Iraq.</p>
<p>In the article Cordesman and Toukan provide a comprehensive breakdown of both Israeli and Iranian missile capabilities and of the respective capabilities of Israel to launch an air attack and Iran to  defend against one. Which makes it a useful read all on its own. But I want to highlight the above map that shows the three possible attack routes given the limitations of Israeli air ranges. Some things of note. In each case Israel would need in-air refueling both on the way in and on the way out, meaning that they would have to stage their KC-135&#8217;s over the strike routes for some period of time, and all three of the strike routes require transiting Iraqi air space as well as either Saudi, Syrian or Turkish skies. Leaving for comments the question of whether either Turkey (given the recent Gaza embargo sea clash) or Saudi Arabia would look the other way and not even challenge the refueling effort, will the U.S. retain enough air assets in Iraq after mid-2011 to support an air-refueling effort on behalf of Israel or to provide safe havens for returning Israeli fighter bombers that might sustain damage?</p>
<p>The United States has formally controlled at least Northern and Southern Iraqi airspace since the first Gulf War via the No-Fly Zones. I surmise, though don&#8217;t know for sure, that that control will lapse upon U.S. withdrawal of combat troops from Iraq, or that if there is a residual U.S. air presence that it will at least on paper be subject to Iraqi government approval. Which leads to the question in the title of the post, the whole premise of a unilateral Israeli strike on Iran relies on at least tacit assistance by the U.S. and either Saudi Arabia or Turkey and given the refueling constraints outlined by Cordesman and Toukan almost certainly active assistance at least on the way out, because once those bombs start dropping nobody is going to be able to pretend nothing is going on.</p>
<p>So is time running out for Israel? Is that why we are getting the big push by Goldberg and others? Because they know that any such attack without full US control of Iraqi air space falls from the realm of improbable to impossible?</p>

<p>Restoring Affordability<br />Waste, Unneeded Programs Hinder Modernization<br />By ASHTON CARTER Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition Technology and Logistics<br />Published: 19 July 2010</p>
<p>Read the whole article at <a href="http://www.defensenews.com/story.php?i=4716195&#038;c=FEA&#038;s=COM" target="_blank">Defense News</a></p>
<p>Ashton Carter says:<br />
<blockquote>“The department spends approximately $700 billion annually for our country&#8217;s defense. About $300 billion of this is spent inside the department, on the salaries and benefits of military personnel and civilian employees. But the remainder &#8211; $400 billion &#8211; is spent on goods-and-services contracts with entities outside the Defense Department.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Carter’s use of the word “defense” is ministry of truth speak, so little of that $700B is for defense to be insignificant, I will not go to the propaganda contained in appeals to a “nation at war” or ill defined “capabilities” against no threats.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter is to “find” reductions on the order of $100B over 5 years from $3,500 billion of planned outlays. Worse the miniscule savings will not be returned to the taxpayer or lenders as Under Secretary of Defense Lynn, a former industry insider:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Expects that two-thirds of the savings transferred to war-fighting accounts, or approximately $67 billion, should come about this way.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a contrast the UK Ministry of Defence will consume approximately $67 billion or 44billion pounds in one year for their whole defence establishment. That is a bit less than 7% of UK government outlays compared to the US military which consumes just under 20% of USG outlays in 2010, about the same as social security. There will be a one percent increase in the DoD bottom line in 2011; in fact the Deputy Secretary of Defense plan is to use cash drained from the economies to grow the war machines’ “capability”.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter states:<br />
<blockquote>“To realize these savings, real productivity gains must be achieved.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Like in real industries, not the socialized US security apparatus.</p>
<p>He says:<br />
<blockquote>“Unfortunately, this is not the case. For the past decade, more has been costing more. We need to arrest this trend now.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />I observed firsthand how in the past few decades the DoD has been subjected to similar efficiency drives, streamlining, outside commissions, performance based contracts, reengineering and so forth. Mr. Carter’s statement is true for the past 50years despite repeated half hearted efforts at fixing pentagon monopsony spending. This is a reason why the Sec Def is closing the business transformation office, it did nothing at all.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter recognizes the cause, congress, encouraged by the “undue influence” from the concentration of trillions of taxpayer dollars in the security monopsony supports corporate welfare and local jobs programs.</p>
<p>He says:<br />
<blockquote>“We also need the help of Congress. Members of Congress observe with dismay as they are asked to approve ever-increasing funding for the same product or service. We will need their input and support to make necessary adjustments that will in some cases be difficult.”</p></blockquote>
<p>See how the two senators from Virginia are reacting to the idea of closing Joint Forces Command, a military think tank which makes up capabilities to spend money. Closing it is a good thing. But with little pay back, $240M a year from a $700,000 M budget.</p>
<p>There is no conviction behind trying to save $20B out of $700B annual budgets when the nation is $14 trillion in debt.</p>
<p>And the first time some civil servant tried to make a contractor perform and it costs profit the same effects which prevented savings in the past will arise and the industry will continue to require more money to deliver less “capability”. Whatever “capability” is and how it relates to “defense”.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2010/08/11/news/economy/economic_collapse_GDP_unemployment.fortune/index.htm">Fortune published an op-ed piece</a> by Keith R. McCullough at Hedgeye (h/t to my Mom). He argues (not very well, I might add) that QE2 is the doomsday scenario for &#8220;markets&#8221;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to point out the following (mostly because this is a common mistake): what the Fed announced is NOT QE2. Furthermore, the Fed&#8217;s been considering investing options for months now, why the shock and awe treatment from markets?</p>
<p>Here are the <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100810a.htm">FOMC&#8217;s announced investment intentions</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;the Committee will keep constant the Federal Reserve&#8217;s holdings of  securities at their current level by reinvesting principal payments from  agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in longer-term  Treasury securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Fed announcement is NOT a second version of quantitative easing (QE2). Quantitative easing is a &#8220;super&#8221; policy response, where the Fed grows its balance through reserve creation and the purchase of (usually) government assets.</p>
<p>The Fed is reinvesting the principal of maturing securities into longer-dated Treasuries from reserves already created. Therefore, the Fed is simply shifting the asset side of the balance sheet toward a Treasury-only portfolio. Reinvesting maturing Treasuries is regular practice for the Fed. No new quantitative easing.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The announcement should not have been a surprise; it wasn&#8217;t to me. According to the FOMC minutes, the Fed has been considering investment options regarding the principal of the maturing securities for months now. From the <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20100623.htm">June 22-23 FOMC minutes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>First, the Committee could consider halting all reinvestment of the  proceeds of maturing securities. Such a strategy would shrink the size  of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s balance sheet and reduce the quantity of  reserve balances in the banking system gradually over time. Second, the  Committee could reinvest the proceeds of maturing securities only in new  issues of Treasury securities with relatively short maturities&#8211;bills  only, or bills as well as coupon issues with terms of three years or  less. This strategy would maintain the size of the Federal Reserve&#8217;s  balance sheet but would reduce somewhat the average maturity of the  portfolio and increase its liquidity.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Committee decided to go with the second strategy, but in an altered form: reinvest the proceeds of maturing securities to maintain both the size of the balance sheet and the average maturity of the portfolio. And a few members favored the <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomcminutes20100623.htm">Fed&#8217;s August announcement</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A few participants suggested selling MBS and using the proceeds to  purchase Treasury securities of comparable duration, arguing that doing  so would hasten the move toward a Treasury-securities-only portfolio  without tightening financial conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>So you see, the FOMC announcement to buy longer-dated Treasuries is not QE2; is not a surprise; and for reasons that I did not describe here, doesn&#8217;t portend economic collapse (see this <a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/publications/?docid=1286">policy brief</a>, or <a href="http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/wp_603.pdf">the working paper</a>, by Randy Wray and Yeva Nersisyan, where they refute the application of the Reinhart and Rogoff findings).</p>

<blockquote>It really makes one understand why the public often dismisses academics as out of touch in their ivory towers. One has to imagine that neither Mulligan nor Mankiw ever held a real summer job. Nor, apparently, have they looked at any other nonseasonally adjusted data. Nor do they appear to have much understanding of the basic ebb and flow of US economic activity over the course of the year&#8230;.</p>
<p>It seems to entirely escape them that aggregate demand has a very predictable season pattern &#8211; a seasonal pattern that exists in a recession or expansion.</p>
<p>These seasonal patterns in demand activity are not new. Indeed, I imagine that if the data existed, we would see the pattern has remained virtually unchanged since the dawn of human existence, as least in parts of the world where seasonal weather patterns govern economic life. Indeed, it is the reason we have an influx of teenage labor in the summer. It is a throwback to the days of America&#8217;s agricultural past, when the DEMAND for additional labor in the summer months necessitated closing schools for the summer.</p>
<p>As sure as the sun rises each day and winter turns to spring, sales spike at the end of the year as the holiday season approaches, collapse at the beginning of the year, rise in the summer, and then decline in the fall&#8230;</p>
<p>You can set your clock to this trend. Every retail analyst knows this trend. Every teenager who has ever held a summer job knows this trend. And a huge swath of data follows similar trends, albeit usually without the pronounced end of year impact. Building activity, waste disposal, tourism, you name it, it has a seasonal demand pattern. I only have to look out my ivory tower to see it &#8211; stuff grows faster in the summer, and the city hires crews of teenagers to cut it back. The pool down the road is open and staffed by teenage lifeguards only in the summer. Not because the lifeguards are available, but because there is no demand for an outdoor pool most of the year in Eugene.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>The Non-Relationship Between Interest Rates and the Money Supply, Part 2</strong><br />Cross-posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=138"><strong>Presimetrics Blog</strong></a>.</p>
<p>This post is a bit less about Presidents than usual, but its a follow-up to last week&#8217;s post on the non-relationship between the money supply and interest rates.  (That post appeared both at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=130">Presimetrics</a> and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/08/non-relationship-between-interest-rates.html">Angry Bear</a> blogs.  In that post, I noted that the Federal Reserve tends to move the money supply monthly and seasonally with no corresponding change in the fed funds rate.  For example, the Fed will increase the money supply in December to make sure there&#8217;s adequate money in circulation for the Christmas shopping season, and yet interest rates don&#8217;t move at all.  </p>
<p>This week, I want to expand on that, and point out that I wasn&#8217;t entirely accurate.  There actually is a relationship between interest rates and the money supply, but its not the the one taught in textbooks.  The textbook relationship, as I noted last week, can be described like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed determines what the Federal Funds interest rate should be. If the Fed wants to reduce interest rates, it will create money out of thin air and use it to buy bonds. Because there is more money competing to buy bonds, the interest rate bonds have to pay falls. At the same time, the added money sloshing around becomes cheaper for anyone to borrow, whether they’re issuing bonds or not. On the flip side, if the Fed wants to raise interest rates, it sells bonds. That forces anyone else trying to sell bonds to raise interest rates to compete. Additionally, because the Fed retires the money it gets paid for the bonds it sells, that process reduces the amount of money available in the economy, making it harder to come by and hence more costly.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the money supply and interest rates are negatively correlated.  An increase in money supply leads to a decrease in interest rates, and a decrease in the money supply leads to an increase in interest rates.  There is an alternative story, but it only applies to high inflation environments.  If you&#8217;re in Argentina in 1982, for example, the money supply is increasing so fast that any little bit of new money translates immediately into inflation and higher interest rates. </p>
<p>So there&#8217;s the theory, what everyone knows is true.  But what really happens?  For that, as always, we cut to the data.  The Federal Reserve&#8217;s Economic Database (FRED) reports the <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/FEDFUNDS">federal funds rate going back to July of 1954</a>.  For the money supply, we used <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M1NS">M1</a> from 1959 to the present, and <a href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publications/bms2/issue/60/download/102/section1.pdf">the money stock</a> for years before that.</p>
<p>The graph below shows the correlation between the 12 Month Percent Change in M1 and the Fed Funds rate in the same period, one month later, two months later, etc.:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TGMQmkFnUUI/AAAAAAAAAWg/EKGUiQsz6CU/s1600/interest1.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TGMQmkFnUUI/AAAAAAAAAWg/EKGUiQsz6CU/s320/interest1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 1</p>
<p>The graph shows that the correlation between the percentage change in M1 over a year ending in a given month and the Fed Funds rate in the same month is about 14%.  The correlation between the annual percent change in M1 and the Fed Funds rate in the next month rises to 16%, and so forth.  The 1 year change in M1 has a higher correlation with the Fed Funds rate 36 months later than with any lag on the Fed Funds rate.  In plain English, increases in M1 lead to increases in the Fed Funds rate, and decreases in M1 lead to decreases in the Fed Funds rate.  That doesn&#8217;t sound at all the textbooks tell us we should expect in a world that isn&#8217;t suffering from hyperinflation.</p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking to yourself&#8230; maybe that relationship is a function of the fed trying to react to a slowing economy.  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Strip out months in which the economy is in recession, plus the three months leading up to and the 3 months leading out of the recession, and the graph looks like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TGMRHnjXOeI/AAAAAAAAAWo/IJWOsozeDo4/s1600/interest2.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TGMRHnjXOeI/AAAAAAAAAWo/IJWOsozeDo4/s320/interest2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 2.</p>
<p>Notice&#8230; the correlation drops a wee bit, but the shape of the curve is pretty much the same.  Once again, it is fairly evident that this does not conform in any way to the classic textbook story.  </p>
<p>So what is going on?  My guess is that in the U.S., for the period for which we have data, in general:</p>
<p>1.  changing the money supply has had no direct relationship on the Fed Funds rate<br />2.  changing the money supply has had a direct effect on the economy; increasing M1 (actually, real M1 per capita) causes the economy to grow more rapidly, and decreasing the real money supply causes the economy to grow more slowly or contract<br />3.  because increases in the (real) money supply cause the economy to grow more rapidly, eventually an increase in the money supply will lead the Fed to raise interest rates in an attempt to slow the economy (to avoid inflation).  On the other hand, because reductions in the (real) money supply lead to slower economic growth or economic contraction, these reductions will eventually lead the Fed to lower interest rates to try to get the economy to grow more quickly.  </p>
<p>Step 2 is something we cover in the book, but I hope to write another post showing that soon.</p>

<p>Calling high unemployment the “new normal” is a lazy way to cover up poor fiscal policy.</p>
<p>We are now starting to see the economic impact of the ‘new normal’ in practice, as Paul Krugman outlined the other day.   Having been bullied into adopting austerity measures apparently thinking they will help their economies grow, it is beginning to dawn on many “Austerian” governments that their embrace of hair shirt economics is beginning to undermine growth.</p>
<p>Exhibit A is the United Kingdom.  The NY Times gave an account of British towns “reeling” from the implementation of nationwide expenditure cuts of some $130 billion introduced in last June’s budget.   “A mass execution without appeal” is how the Times described it.</p>
<p>Along with this article comes a report from the Financial Times, “Economic Fears Rise as House Prices Dip”, documenting how UK house prices have began to fall for the first time in over a year this past July.  The article notes that this setback has come “after a year when the recovery in house prices surprised almost everyone and brought relief to Britain’s stretched banks, [so] the return of a buyers’ market threatens to increase jitters in a fragile economy.”</p>
<p>Well, to us neither today’s news about British municipalities reeling from the impact of the new Tory coalition government’s budget cuts, nor last year’s recovery in UK housing, was at all “surprising”.  Beset by the greatest financial crisis in the post World War II period, the last UK Labour Government  did what any sensible administration ought to do when there is not enough activity in the economy to maintain employment and labor force growth: they  increased public demand via increased net government spending.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />For all of the wailing about Britain’s “extraordinary” budget deficit, the policy response by the Brown Administration was in fact a good one.  By and large, it stabilized the economy and kept unemployment down to the 7% level.  In spite of the criticisms by the head of the Bank of England, the government made a very legitimate case that the rapid increase in government debt was an unavoidable consequence of the financial crisis (in itself the product of a private sector debt binge).  Yes, perhaps one could very well criticize the fact that a large number of the benefits accrued towards those experiencing the least disadvantage, but this does not invalidate the notion of deploying a government’s fiscal resources when confronted with a huge output gap and huge labor underutilization.</p>
<p>By the same token, attempts to mindlessly decrease alleged “government waste” (the new justification for the attack on the welfare state) in the context of ongoing high rates of unemployment is bound to lead to further economic weakness AND a higher public debt to GDP ratio, via a shrinking GDP.   Undoubtedly, some government expenditure is highly inefficient (although, in light of the plethora of private sector induced debt bubbles, it is hardly credible to argue that all spending from the private sector is invariably more efficient than government).</p>
<p>But the deficit as a whole is nothing more than an accounting expression of a gap between expenditures and receipts.  Complaining about this as “unsustainable” is analogous to blaming a football scoreboard, because it shows your team losing a game by 2 touchdowns, rather than focusing on the activity on the field which created the 2 touchdown gap in the first place.</p>
<p>In the UK (as in the USA), consumers are still trying to reduce their debt exposure and the saving ratio has been rising. So there is very little thirst for credit coming from that sector.  This is, then, a problem of aggregate demand deficiency, which can only be rectified via fiscal policy.  Unfortunately, for political reasons, that is impossible right now.  Neither the Federal Reserve, nor the Bank of England (two of the leading practitioners of “quantitative easing” in the past 18 months) can simply wave their magic “QE” wand and improve the economy via monetary policy.  Lower interest rates might lower the cost of borrowing (and help service a still large private sector debt overhang), but such a policy also steals income from savers, such as pensioners.  And in regard to overall aggregate demand, private businesses have to have positive expectations that they will be able to sell the output they produce. Those expectations remain subdued which is why the commercial banks in the US are still not lending very much, whilst prevailing high debt levels render further borrowing by consumers extremely problematic</p>
<p>Having publicly deprecated the impact of fiscal policy and warned of the long term deleterious effects of climbing public debt, of course, the Federal Reserve and/or the Bank of England cannot now reverse course and credibly back more fiscal stimulus.  To cover up the flaccid nature of their respective central banks’ ineffectual monetary policy response, a number of economists present the current high levels of unemployment as “structural”, implying that there is little that can be done about it. It is simply the “new normal”, which in reality represents the ultimate in political failure.  Our policy elites don’t dare concede the futility of fiscal austerity.  Hence,  they resort to invoking theories like the “equilibrium unemployment rate”, or “non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment “(NAIRU, for short), the implication being that attempts to reduce labor underutilization by expansionary fiscal policy would be inflationary in the absence of “structural reforms” , such as privatization, labor market deregulation, anti-union legislation and harsh welfare measures.   But these “supply side” measures in effect reflect the agenda preferences of the late 20th century, which have destroyed incomes and eviscerated the middle class. Our “new normal”, then, represents a collective shrug of our policymakers’ shoulders, ignoring a growing undercurrent of anger and despair.</p>

                                <p>Robert Reich lays out some figures for the military jobs programs both in manpower and hardware:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://robertreich.org/post/938938180/americas-biggest-jobs-program-the-u-s-military">America’s biggest — and only major — jobs program</a> is the U.S. military.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over 1,400,000 Americans are now on active duty; another 833,000 are in the reserves, many full time. Another 1,600,000 Americans work in companies that supply the military with everything from weapons to utensils. (I’m not even including all the foreign contractors employing non-US citizens.)</p>
<p>If we didn’t have this giant military jobs program, the U.S. unemployment rate would be over 11.5 percent today instead of 9.5 percent.</p>
<p>And without our military jobs program personal incomes would be dropping faster. The Commerce Department reported Monday the only major metro areas where both net earnings and personal incomes rose last year were San Antonio, Texas, Virginia Beach, Virginia, and Washington, D.C. — because all three have high concentrations of military and federal jobs.</p>
<p>This isn’t an argument for more military spending. Just the opposite. Having a giant undercover military jobs program is an insane way to keep Americans employed. It creates jobs we don’t need but we keep anyway because there’s no honest alternative. We don’t have an overt jobs program based on what’s really needed.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The Pentagon’s budget — and its giant undercover jobs program — keeps expanding. The President has asked Congress to hike total defense spending next year 2.2 percent, to $708 billion. That’s 6.1 percent higher than peak defense spending during the Bush administration.</p>
<p>This sum doesn’t even include Homeland Security, Veterans Affairs, nuclear weapons management, and intelligence. Add these, and next year’s national security budget totals about $950 billion.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/business/economy/11leonhardt.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">New York Times David Leonhardt argues</a> that real wages are rising, so those resilient workers that remain employed will benefit from the bounce-back in &#8220;effective pay&#8221;. The problem with this insight is twofold: first, the expansion phase of real hourly compensation, a broader measure of total earnings, is falling; and second, sitting atop a mountain of consumer and mortgage debt, the aggregate economy cannot afford a compensationless recovery.</p>
<p>From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/11/business/economy/11leonhardt.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">NY Times</a>:<br />
<blockquote>But since this recent recession began in December 2007, real average hourly pay has risen nearly 5 percent. Some employers, especially state and local governments, have cut wages. But many more employers have continued to increase pay.</p>
<p>Something similar happened during the Great Depression, notes Bruce Judson of the Yale School of Management. Falling prices meant that workers who held their jobs received a surprisingly strong effective pay raise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rebecca: The referenced &#8220;real wages&#8221; are the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/realer.t02.htm">real average hourly earnings figures</a> for production and nonsupervisory workers, <a href="http://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cestn1.htm">80% </a>of the total nonfarm payroll. The broader measure of total earnings is real hourly compensation (<a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/prod2.htm">see Table A</a> and get the data from the <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/COMPRNFB?cid=2">Fred database</a>). Real hourly compensation measures compensation for all workers, including wages, 401k contributions, stock options, tips, and self-employed business owner compensation. (You can see a comparison of the earnings/compensation series in <a href="http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2005/05/art1full.pdf">Exhibit 1 here.</a>)</p>
<p>Since December 2007, real hourly compensation has increased just 1.3%. Furthermore, the index declined four consecutive quarters through Q2 2010, a first since 1979-1980. If the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">NBER dates </a>the onset of the expansion at Q3 2009 (the first quarter of <a href="http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">po</a><a href="http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">sitive GDP growth</a> in 2009), real hourly compensation will have dropped .7% through Q2 2010! That&#8217;s pathetic compared to the average 2.5% gain during the first 4 quarters of expansion spanning the previous 10 recessions.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s how I see it: the problem is not that real hourly compensation is falling during the the recovery, per se, it&#8217;s that real hourly compensation is falling during the recovery of a  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Balance-Sheet-Recession-Uncharted-Implications/dp/0470821167">balance sheet recession.</a><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGLatM1pgTI/AAAAAAAADMI/bqYqyVr36pQ/s1600/recovery_earnings_chart.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TGLatM1pgTI/AAAAAAAADMI/bqYqyVr36pQ/s400/recovery_earnings_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>In the context of wage and compensation growth, the NY Times article was misleading in its comparison of the Great Depression to the &#8217;07-&#8217;09 Great Recession. Mass default during the Great Depression wiped private-sector balance sheets clean, no debt. But not this time around. <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/reducing-household-financial-leverage.html">We&#8217;re going to need a lot of income growth</a> (the BLS measure of real hourly compensation includes measures of income at the BEA) to increase saving enough to deleverage the aggregate household balance sheet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/08/consumer-confidence.html">I&#8217;ll say it again</a>: we can&#8217;t afford a jobless recovery. Specifically, we can&#8217;t afford a compensationless recovery.</p>

I have not done the calculation, but this will generate a significant downward revision of the second quarter real GDP report.  Remember, BEA does not have this data when they do the first GDP report.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGKhUsWxQAI/AAAAAAAABTA/FfITssfLHFU/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGKhUsWxQAI/AAAAAAAABTA/FfITssfLHFU/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>The plunge was driven by a 5.2% jump in real nonpetroleum imports although petroleum imports also rose 1.9%.  Since the May 2009 bottom, real nonpetroleum imports have risen some 31.9%.  Real petroleum imports are up 8.9% over the same period.  Real exports fell 1.6% and as the charts makes obvious they have been flat in recent months &#8212; they are actually down 1.5% from their March 2010 peak.  This should force forecasters to significantly revise their growth forecast down as what looked like a strong rebound in exports late last year now appears to be faltering.</p>
