                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>A year and a half ago <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/how-did-lehman-manage-that.html">I speculated as to how Lehman had managed to get it’s unsecured debt to be worth only 12 cents on the dollar.</a>  With my tinfoil hat firmly on, I wondered if they had written CDS on themselves.  I may just be demonstrating my ignorance of the law and institutions, but I suspect that I was essentially right.<br />LOUISE STORY and ERIC DASH have <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/business/13lehman.html">an important article in the New York Times </a>in which they allege that Lehman hid investments off its balance sheet using deals with a privately held financial firm Hudson Castle and its subsidiaries.  <br />After the jump I quote them on one huge deal and explain why I think that Lehman, in effect, wrote a CDS on itself.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>One of the vehicles that Hudson Castle created was called Fenway, which was often used to lend to Lehman, including in the summer of 2008, as the investment bank foundered. <br />[skip]<br />Lehman itself bought $3 billion of Fenway notes just before its bankruptcy that, in turn, were used to back a loan from Fenway to a Lehman subsidiary. The loan was secured by part of Lehman&#8217;s investments with a California property developer, SunCal, and those investments also collapsed.  [skip]<br />Further complicating the arrangement, Lehman later pledged those Fenway notes to JPMorgan as collateral for still other loans as Lehman began to founder. When JPMorgan realized the circular relationship, “JPMorgan concluded that Fenway was worth practically nothing,”</p></blockquote>
<p>Now my ignorance.  I will assume that the loan from JPMorgan was a full recourse full faith and credit loan – that is I will assume that since the collateral turned out to be worth less than Lehman’s debt to JPMorgan, the Lehman estate owes JPMorgan the balance.<br />It appears that Fenway’s only assets are Lehman debt and SunCal instruments both of which are in default.  If I understand the debt contract correctly (and pigs fly) JPMorgan has two claims on Lehman – that is the amount that the Lehman estate theoretically owes JPMorgan is more than the amount it owed before it collapsed.<br />My guess is that JPMorgan now owns Fenway and therefore Lehman’s debt to Fenway which would cover JPMorgan’s loan to Lehman except for the little problem that Lehman’s debt is now worth 12 cents on the dollar.  I guess this debt will be resolved eventually.  Let’s say at 12 cents on the dollar.  That would only cover 12% of Lehman’s directly contracted debt to JPMorgan (the balance of the loan).  If so JPMorgan is theoretically owed 1.88 times the amount Lehman owed it when Lehman went bankrupt.  This would mean that JPMorgan will end up with (0.12)(1.88) = 0.2256 times that amount.   <br />If I am right, the point is that bankruptcy caused a sudden increase in Lehman’s theoretical liabilities (that is the face value of its liabilities &#8212; that is the denominator of the recovery ratio whose numerator is Lehman’s assets).</p>
<p>This is just what would happen if Lehman wrote a CDS on itself.<br />Now I might be wrong and JPMorgan agreed that, if it seized the Fenway notes then the loan contract would be terminated (resolved over done) with no further recourse.  In that case, the amount Lehman owes JPMorgan is just the amount it owed JPMorgan before going bankrupt.</p>
<p>I hope this is all clear to readers, but I am totally confused.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/04/deficit-this-is-not-good-news.html">Brad DeLong</a> and <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/EconomistsView/~3/SxdOVYrOtHw/is-a-falling-deficit-good-news.html">Mark Thoma</a> posit that a falling US public deficit is bad news – they are right!</p>
<p>Deficit hysteria is now mainstream thinking, while the more appropriate hysteria should be <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/us-economy-on-surface-and-under-hood.html">“jobs hysteria”</a>. How in the world is nominal income growth expected to finance a drop in consumer debt leverage if the government supports a smaller deficit? TARP costs less and tax receipt growth is beating expectations. But that&#8217;s all it is, beating expectations.</p>
<p>This only proves the endogeneity of the deficit: the sole reason that the private sector is producing stronger-than-expected growth in tax receipts is BECAUSE the government ran large deficits.</p>
<p>Put it this way: as long as the US is running current account deficits, then a shrinking government deficit will, by definition, squeeze liquidity from the private sector. During a <a href="http://www.japanreview.net/review_bsr.htm">“balance sheet recession”</a>, the government should be growing its balance sheet not shrinking it.</p>
<p>An excerpt from the <a href="http://www.boj.or.jp/en/type/stop/js/js97sm.htm">Japan&#8217;s Quarterly Economic Outlook (Summary*) (Summer 1997)</a>:<br />
<blockquote>“Thus, recovery in personal consumption is expected to continue after the reaction to the rise in demand ahead of the consumption tax hike subsides in the near future. However, the pace of recovery is likely to be moderate considering the increases in the tax burden, such as the rise in the consumption tax.”</p></blockquote>
<p>RW: Boy were they wrong – moderate?</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S8S_RxTOfAI/AAAAAAAAC_8/by1Jon7qJg8/s1600/Japan_Chart.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S8S_RxTOfAI/AAAAAAAAC_8/by1Jon7qJg8/s400/Japan_Chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a><a name="more"></a> GDP fell 2.0% in 1998 (from +1.6% growth in 1997) and consumption growth turned negative over the year, -1.1% (from +0.8% in 1997). <a href="http://csis.org/files/media/csis/events/081029_japan_koo.pdf">Please see slide 9</a> from one of Richard Koo’s presentation in 2008; he highlights the policy-mistake-induced “unnecessary government deficits&#8221;. The point is: the government deficit is not some exogenous “thing” that the government controls; it’s very much endogenous and a function of private demand.</p>
<p>We’re on this road now: squeezing liquidity out of the private sector; supporting minimal wage growth; and imminent deleveraging is on the horizon(more likely the default route).  And Congress is happy that they are squeezing private sector liquidity? I guess so, as reported by the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304703104575174263375942030.html?KEYWORDS=john+d+mckinnon">Wall Street Journal yesterday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Like a number of Democrats, Mr. Blumenauer said he&#8217;s &#8220;intrigued&#8221; with the consumption-tax idea. Tax experts say consumption taxes are regressive, because lower-income people tend to spend more of their income. But a consumption tax could be designed with offsetting breaks for lower-income Americans, to shield them from its impacts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Sounds to me as if someone has the sneaking suspicion that people who knew <a href="http://www.theonion.com/articles/wamu-files-for-chaplev,6502/">WaMu was headed towards ChapLev</a> did that on purpose so that they could give themselves a little golden parachute by buying CDSs.</p>

                                <p>by Marshall Auerback, Fellow and Contributor to the Roosevelt Institute&#8217;s <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/" target="_blank">New Deal 2.0</a></p>
<p><em>Marshall Auerback warns that Germany’s obsession with a defense against the external threat of inflation is blinding them to the real risks facing Europe.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maginot_Line" target="_blank">The Maginot Line</a>, named after French Minister of Defense André Maginot, was a line of defenses which France constructed along its borders with Germany and Italy after suffering appalling damage and casualties during World War I. The French thought they were now protected from a repeat, and believed the defenses impenetrable.</p>
<p>Chatting to a number of German participants at last week’s <a href="http://ineteconomics.org/" target="_blank">Institute for New Economic Thinking</a> (INET) conference, we couldn’t help getting a sense of the economic parallel in regard to Germany’s deep resistance to greater fiscal expansion as means of dealing with the problem of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIIGS">“PIIGS“</a>.</p>
<p><strong>The Problem</strong>:</p>
<p>Germany’s fiscal deficit fetishism is largely a product of that country’s own hyperinflation experience during the Weimar Republic. As deeply ingrained as that trauma remains in the German psyche, it is now taking on an almost hysterically irrational quality as evidenced by the latest “rescue package” for Greece. Its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_and_Monetary_Union_of_the_European_Union" target="_blank">EMU</a> “partners”, led by Greece and soon to be followed by Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Italy, are increasingly being forced to embrace Germanic-style hair shirt economics, because the obvious fiscal response is constrained via self-imposed rules inherent in the rules governing the European Monetary Union. These rules are regarded, almost to a man, as “sound economics” by Germany’s policy makers and the vast majority of its citizens (if one is to measure this via the national polls, which continue to indicate visceral hostility to “bailouts” for “lazy Greek scroungers and tax dodgers”). We wonder if they’ll still be feeling that way if the contagion extends to Berlin and Paris.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Historians all know how effective the Maginot Line ultimately proved for the French in terms of defending a German occupation of their country during the Second World War: the Germans were able to avoid a direct assault on the Maginot Line by violating the neutrality of Belgium, Luxemburg and the Netherlands, whilst the Luftwaffe simply flew over it.</p>
<p>Likewise, we think Germany’s “Weimar 2.0″ phobia is based on similarly flawed “Maginot Line” thinking, thereby generating a correspondingly ineffectual response to the EMU crisis. It’s becoming a story of intellectual hubris, defending “good economics”, Germanic-style, over common sense.</p>
<p>Judging from the market’s reaction to the 45m euro rescue package of Greece, it appears that the EMU and, by extension, the euro, have dodged a bullet for now. But the PIIGS problems remain. The terms and conditions include IMF ‘austerity’ measures, which will act to slow the economy of Greece and the entire EU — which is already dangerously weak to the point of promoting higher budget deficits through low tax revenues and high transfer payments. All of which serves to further weaken the creditworthiness of all the member nations.</p>
<p>It also increases the euro debts of the other contributing nations because they are being forced to contribute to this funding package for Greece. The implication of the same type of ‘rescue’ for the larger euro nations is not pretty. Expect much higher levels of stress for the remaining euro member nations presumed to be ’strong’ as the same kind of forced austerity appears in store for other “violators” of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_convergence_criteria" target="_blank">Maastricht Convergence Criteria</a>. Think about Spain, which now has 20% unemployment, or Ireland, which has a classic Iceland problem, given that the liabilities of its banking system vastly exceed the country’s overall GDP.</p>
<p>The underlying assumption of the rescue package is not sound. The stronger nations still think by offering a big enough “guarantee” the markets will take up the slack and finance Greece for them. But the markets now want to see the cash and, more importantly, they want a firm demonstration that the funding guarantees provided will help to sustain the ability of nations like Greece to service its debt without turning the nation into an industrial wasteland. The markets no longer believe in a “contingent liability” model, which is something akin to indicating that you have a rich relative who can help you out if needed. The EMU’s “rich relative” has already indicated that this is verboten, but it has denied Greece and the other PIIGS nations the means to grow adequately to service debt going forward.</p>
<p>The Prognosis:</p>
<p>The euro should therefore fundamentally remain on the weak side after a temporary bout of short-covering, as the high levels of euro national government deficits are adding the non government sectors’ holding of euro denominated financial assets. And the austerity measures are likely to increase euro government deficits and thereby exacerbates potential national insolvency problems amongst the euro zone nations.</p>
<p>The common Germanic retort to this line of thinking is that a default in, say, California, would no more threaten the viability of the dollar than a Greek default would endanger the euro. Perhaps, although the Lehman experience should have taught us all that the negative externalities of such an event can seldom be determined in advance, given the opacity of today’s funding mechanisms. Additionally, the United States of America is an existing NATIONAL fiscal authority which can respond to the growing problem of state insolvency via dollar creation and corresponding revenue sharing with the states. No such comparable fiscal entity yet exists in the euro zone.</p>
<p>Although we have hitherto characterized Greece as the EMU’s “Lehman” problem, the rescue package announced on Monday makes us that think that the better parallel for Greece might well be Bear Stearns. Bear’s “rescue” in March 2008, initially looked like it enabled the global financial markets to avert a growing crisis in the asset backed securities markets. What it did in reality was kick the can down the road, as the underlying structural problems which created the crisis in the first place remained unresolved. The credit crisis that began in August 2007 involved failure of both the liquidity and the solvency risk systems. The consequent freeze-up arose because the subsequent bankruptcy of Lehman and collapse of AIG destroyed the markets’ expectations (built up by years of bailouts) of their being an ultimate market maker, which would always be able to deal in these securitized instruments.</p>
<p>By the same token, the creation of a common currency via monetary union has created market expectations that one country’s paper is as good as another, which explains why, for so many years, “fiscally profligate” nations such as Italy were able to borrow at Germanic level interest rates. But the decision a few months ago by the European Central Bank to block a basic “repo” function — namely, the purchases of a number of European commercial banks of Greek government debt and exchanging this debt via repos with the ECB for German and French government paper is what appears to have initially triggered the Greek crisis and raised issues of Athens’s potential insolvency.</p>
<p>From what we understand, the cessation of this repo function was largely done at the behest of the Germans, who saw this activity as a kind of “back door monetization” which would lead inevitably to inflation. This, despite the fact that the entire euro zone is characterized by huge unemployment , high output gaps, and collapsing domestic consumption. All of this at the core is being driven by Germany’s pathological fear of inflation which they see as the inevitable consequence of excessive government budget deficits.</p>
<p>But Germany’s irrational fears of inflation are storing up the conditions for a far greater crisis down the line. The euro contagion could now very well spread to Italy Portugal Spain and Ireland, all of which (under the terms of this package) have to lend to Greece, at around 5%. So what happens to their funding costs? They go north of 5% as a next step. In the US, when good banks took over bad banks, they became bad banks themselves (see Bank of America and Countrywide). And what about the seniority structure of these loans? Do they subordinate Greek Government Bond holders? One assumes yes, but this is not made clear by the rescue package. In short, this appears to be a cobbled together solution, and it won’t work for a Spain or an Italy. There’s no clarity even on how it gets ratified. The EU says it’s done, but Germany and Holland say they need Parliamentary approval (which can easily be delayed).</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: in the aftermath of World War I, German production capacity was either significantly damaged, or redirected toward output required by the military. The Allied blockade further restricted imports well into 1919, and in 1923, French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr valley which held a good deal of Germany’s manufacturing base. All of these measures significantly restricted Germany’s capacity to produce, fueling the distributional conflict that fed the hyperinflation.</p>
<p>There is nothing like that today in Germany, yet “Weimar 2.0″ thinking predominates in much the same way that “Maginot Line” thinking dominated French thinking in its defense establishment. The obsession with a”defense” against the “external” threat of inflation, is blinding Germany. It doesn’t see the risk that the collapse of aggregate demand within the European Monetary Union will ultimately lead to a collapse in Germany’s export sector (a large chunk of which is the product of intra-European trade), and the corresponding extension of the “PIIGS” disease of slow growth and high unemployment to the heartland of the euro zone. We know how it ended for France, once the Maginot Line proved to be a defense more apparent than real.</p>
<p>We hope that Germany’s similarly “successful” defense of inflation does not lead to a comparably disastrous result for Europe today.</p>

                                <p>Lifted from comments.  Vtcodger summarizes his thoughts on a layman&#8217;s approach to trade and trade policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>1.  It&#8217;s pretty clear that there is no protocol for determining if a currency is under or over valued relative to another or by how much.  It&#8217;s all guesswork.  </p>
<p>2.  Foreign Exchange probably is not a marketplace that is efficient with regard to cost of goods.  Other factors like perceived stability of currencies and speculative forces probably cause exchange rates to be (considerably?) different than they would be if they were set only by cost of manufacture, shipping, and similar trade related factors.  </p>
<p>3.  Attempts to deal with trade balances between individual pairs of countries in isolation are probably going to produce dubious results.  (But that won&#8217;t keep folks from trying).  </p>
<p>4.  If one were to look at all the trade relationships on the planet, one would probably find that there is no set of  values for the currencies that makes them all &#8220;fair&#8221;.  </p>
<p>5.  The expectation that revaluing the renimbi upwards will solve US trade problems is probably nuts.  A small upward revaluation will probably help.  But for every good, once some other nation (which will rarely be the US) becomes the low cost provider, the (Multi-national companies) will simply swich providers and the Yuan exchange rate will be irrelevant to trade in that product.  Beyond a certain point, this is a lose-lose game for the US and China.</p></blockquote>

I had the pleasure of attending the conference, my first time to Cambridge. John Maynard Keynes wrote his *General Theory* at King&#8217;s College. And as if that wasn&#8217;t enough, I dined with blogging legends, Mark Thoma and Yves Smith! The photo was taken at the conference by another attendee, <a href="http://www.ofanimalsandspirits.com/post/506584844/lord-skideslky-easily-keynes-finest-biographer">Pierpaolo Barbieri</a>: &#8220;Lord Skideslky, easily Keynes’ finest biographer&#8221;.</p>
<p>The conference was a spectacular fireworks display of economic panels, featuring  experts across a broad spectrum of applied macroeconomic theory and policy, including banking and development. (You can see the speaker list, presentations, and video <a href="http://ineteconomics.org/">here</a>). Definitely read other conference pieces by <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2010/04/09/notes-from-inet-conference-the-central-bank-as-deal-of-the-last-resort-9666/">Marshall Auerback</a>, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/04/keynes-and-hayek.html">Mark Thoma</a>, and <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/04/soros-galbraith-and-stiglitz-on-resisting-inevitability-in-greece.html">Yves Smith</a>.</p>
<p>Through INET, George Soros is funding a vision: that new and innovative macroeconomic theory prevent, rather than fuel, future “Superbubbles”. INET&#8217;s goal is the following:<br />
<blockquote>“to create an environment nourished by open discourse and critical thinking where the next generation of scholars has the support to go beyond our prevailing economic paradigms and advance our understanding of the economic system as a tool to meet social objectives.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a tall order, and likely not the intended output from the inaugural conference. But what Rob Johnson, Executive Director of INET, probably did have in mind was something of a declaration of war against outdated, disproved, or even deleterious macroeconomic policy and research. And there, I believe that he succeeded.</p>
<p>There was no shortage of criticism at the INET conference.<a name="more"></a>
<ul>
<li>Joseph Stiglitz reiterated the sharp divergence between representative agent models and reality.</li>
<li>James Galbraith went the even more aggressive route by suggesting that REH (rational expectations hypothesis), EMH (efficient markets hypothesis), RAM (representative agent models), and DSGE (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models) be buried beneath a bed of garlic below Keynes&#8217; quarters with guards standing atop the burial site. (This was not a direct quote but very close.)</li>
<li>Simon Johnson pressed the need for more action to relieve the systemic pressures coming from the still top-heavy <a href="http://www.ffiec.gov/nicpubweb/nicweb/Top50form.aspx">US banking system</a>.</li>
<li>Dominique Strauss-Kahn charged global policymakers of being complacent with monetary and fiscal policy over the last decade. They were lured in by ostensibly stable growth, when in fact the financial foundation was crumbling below (after, of course, he was disrupted by a globalization protest with the catch phrase  “the IMF is the Problem not the solution”).</li>
</ul>
<p>In my view, the fact that economists were in some sense accepting blame for policy ignorance is a step in the right direction. So what&#8217;s the next step? What will it take to move macroeconomic theory and policy in a truly innovative and novel direction? I don&#8217;t know; but I do see two issues that will likely drag the process.</p>
<p>Problem #1: the financial crisis has rendered much empirical and theoretical research obsolete; clearly, this is a solid chunk of what I refer to as the “aggregate Curriculum Vitae”. There&#8217;s a host of refereed and published literature with now documented spurious results, or entire literature reviews citing papers with theses that tread water at best.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s going to take time to break through the concrete wall of neo-classical macroeconomic denial (among other types of denials). This is the “old boys club”, where careers and prestige are on the line. It&#8217;s the true sense of economics as a falsifiable science: some disproved and obsolete macro theory remains ingrained in the profession as some academics, some policymakers, and some politicians cling to their reputations. This “enables” bad economic policy.</p>
<p>The good thing, though, is with funding and support from Institutes like INET, this enabling behavior cannot last forever. The aggregate may enable the profession now; but if the foundation starts to crack, i.e., the next wave of graduate students and new tenure track researchers break the mold, the profession will rebuild. I hope.</p>
<p>Problem #2. Talented researchers, early in their tenure careers or currently registered in Ph.D. programs, need incentives and professional support to publish alternative views in top journals. It&#8217;s so easy to be shunned from the academic community; just take on an unorthodox research agenda, and  bang, you&#8217;re bright and shiny career may be over before you know it. So what&#8217;s the incentive to rock the boat before establishing tenure? If tenure, by definition, is conditional on top-journal peer-refereed publications?</p>
<p>The new thinking must come from within the Ph.D programs. Building a base of new and sometimes controversial macroeconomic research that is accepted within the top academic community requires funding, but more importantly, a shift in the construct of the labor force. Macro Ph.D. programs across the world need restructuring and innovative teaching that includes an even stronger collaboration between student and adviser than existed before.</p>
<p>They say that lightning never strikes twice. Let&#8217;s hope that the economics profession avoids the second strike&#8230;this time around.</p>

<p>Patrick Chovanec on Seekingalpha asks the basic question on the direction Chinese policy makers will take regarding the currency question, but the underlying question remains unanswered&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>What tipped this month’s figure from a marginal surplus to a deficit was a surge in imports, up 66% from last year. But it&#8217;s going to be important to drill down and take a closer look at exactly what’s making up those imports. If they are finished consumer goods, then it could be a sign of rising consumption in China and a shift towards more balanced trade. But if they consist mainly of raw materials, as many economists suspect, it could indicate that Chinese manufacturers are gearing up for a surge in exports later this year (a phenomenon compounded by rising commodity prices for inputs like iron ore and crude oil, in part due to rising Chinese demand).</p>
<p>The key question is, is this a trend or a cycle? Is it a trend towards higher domestic consumption and more balanced trade, or part of a production cycle that leads right back to where we started? I’m not convinced yet this is a trend.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>That’s probably why even Chen Deming, China’s Minister of Commerce (who has been very vocal these past few weeks about the damage a stronger RMB could do to exporters) is being careful not to overplay the news, describing the March trade deficit as “a blip on the radar screen” that may soon be reversed..</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><p>[snip]</p>
<p>The key thing to watch, regarding China’s willingness to strengthen the RMB, is the recovery of China’s exports. They’re up just over 20% from last year, but that’s just barely back to the level they were at before the global financial crisis struck.</p>

<blockquote><p>Before they cut our paid for stuff, I think we need to &#8220;Audit the Government&#8221;. Not sure if anyone in Congress, Treasury, or Federal Reserve  is up to the task.  </p>
<p>As far as the annual budget goes, I always see those pie charts where they make SS, Medicare and Medicaid look like really big slices of pie, and everything tiny by comparison.  </p>
<p>I think we should make a new pie without SS since it is fully funded from FICA flows, at least at the moment. Then we would get the rest in proper proportion.  </p>
<p>Yes, employment is a problem. Don&#8217;t see us getting back to bubble levels anytime soon. That caused the surplus to disappear just recently instead of 2016-2017 as projected.  </p>
<p>If I can find an economist anywhere, I would like to know why stimulus programs, federal deficits and ZIRP are good for a recessionary economy, but mom &#038; dad or grandma &#038; grandpa spending money is bad? If the fact that the SS trust fund runs out in 2040 is why something needs to be done today, I think employment would still take precedence. Otherwise the kids, mom and dad, grandma and grandpa will all be living in the same house, and we won&#8217;t even know for sure which of the three generations has a job.</p></blockquote>
