<p>Jesse Eisinger and Jake Bernstein come very close to accusing Alec Litowitz of the Magnetar hedge fund of being a financial arsonist.  <a href="http://www.propublica.org/feature/all-the-magnetar-trade-how-one-hedge-fund-helped-keep-the-housing-bubble">I have been speculating about financial arson for a year and a half now.</a></p>
<p>The hypothesis is that Magnetar deliberately set up especially low quality CDOs and bought CDS insurance on them.  Magnetar bought the equity tranches of the CDOs and so had a voice in the selection of underlying assets.  Many anonymous sources claim that Magnetar pressed for risky assets to be included in the CDOs.  </p>
<p>Magnetar clearly used the revenue from their equity tranches to invest massively in CDSs.  They claim they were net losers when all but one of the CDOs which they sponsored defaulted.  So ?  Arson analogy after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>First I admit that in my old posts, I didn&#8217;t discuss setting up an especially bad CDO.  I think it would be legal for Magnetar to have over-insured their holding in a CDO which they sponsored.  However, it seems that they didn&#8217;t insuring just enough that a default would cover the loss of all value of the equity tranche and using the rest of the cash flow to invest in CDSs of similar CDOs which they didn&#8217;t sponsor.  </p>
<p>I think they still made money when the CDOs which they sponsored defaulted &#8212; the value of CDSs on similar CDOs surely shot up.  If Eisinger and Bernstein&#8217;s suspicions are correct, this would be a trick as the apparently similar CDOs were not really all that similar, they hadn&#8217;t been deliberately engineered to fail.</p>
<p>The arson analogy is as follows &#8212; I buy fire insurance on my house equal to its value.  I also buy fire insurance on my neighbors house.  I light a fire in my house (oooops).  Then I sell my neighbor the policy on his house before the fire department puts out the fire.</p>
<p>My house is not over-insured.  His house didn&#8217;t burn down.  There is no problem.  Except I made money via arson.</p>
<p>The difference is that it appears that everything Magnetar did was legal.  </p>
<p>Oh and also it prolonged the housing bubble and caused much more damage than any fire started in Chicago since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Chicago_Fire">a cow kicked over a latern</a>.</p>

<p>Well this is a response to a question in the Rivlin thread. There are widespread misunderstandings about what if anything makes up the &#8220;IOUs&#8221; in the Trust Funds, with many people thinking they just have artificially low rates (and so obviously underperforming theoretical private accounts) or just are open-ended loosey-goosy commitments to maybe pay the money back someday. Well that is not how it works at all on a monthly basis. So with no further ado here they are:<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S8Cnq47yV5I/AAAAAAAAAXI/s4oWWQOs13s/s1600/2009+OAS+Assets.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/S8Cnq47yV5I/AAAAAAAAAXI/s4oWWQOs13s/s400/2009+OAS+Assets.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />As always click to enlarge. Some notes under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />First thing to notice is that these are the assets of the OASI or Old Age/Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, there is an entirely different set of assets in the DI or Disability Insurance One.</p>
<p>Second thing is that there are a range of yields from Certificates as low as 2.750% and Bonds as high as 7.250% with maturities ranging from 2008 to 2022.</p>
<p>Third is that this table gives you a snapshot of two moments in time, year-end 2007 and year-end 2008. A slot marked by &#8220;&#8211;&#8221; in the 2007 column indicates a bond that was issued in 2008 and so obviously did not exist in Dec 2007, similiarly a slot marked by &#8220;&#8211;&#8221; in the 2008 column indicates a bond category that was redeemed during the course of the year</p>
<p>Okay some observations. The instruments with the lowest rates were mostly issued in 2008, which is perfectly in line with the yields in Regular Treasuries in that time period. Contrawise the ones with the highest rates represent mostly 10 year bonds issue eight or nine years ago, once again in line with market conditions then. Note too that with one except every slot that shows zero in 2008 after showing a positive number in 2007 has a face maturity of 2008, these bonds matured and were honored by Treasury, no muss no fuss, just the same kind of routine re-financing you see in the Regular Treasuries.</p>
<p>But there was one interesting exception, the Treasury also redeemed the 3.500% 2009 a year ahead of time, which points out two facts, one that these securities are redeemable at any time, while as we see they are typically held to maturity, in a time of need the Treasury can and will tap them, and too that the Treasury at least in this case did so in the way that best preserved the fiscal health of the Trust Fund, presumedly they could have saved some interest by cashing in the remaining 7.000+% bonds instead.</p>
<p>The Social Security Trust Funds are not investment funds, that is not their purpose, but neither are they simple slush funds designed to separate out workers from their wages. I argue a times that there is something odd about certain details of the actual reporting, but as to daily operations and general management the Trustees have over the years lived up to their titles.</p>

<blockquote><p>Ah, the American public. God love &#8217;em. <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2010/04/economistyougov_polling">The Economist</a> asked if they&#8217;d rather tackle the federal deficit by cutting spending or raising taxes, and the runaway winner was cutting spending, by a margin of 62% to 5%. So what are we willing to cut? Answer: pretty much nothing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>[snip}</p>
<blockquote><p>Beyond that, there were only four areas that even a quarter of the population was willing to cut: mass transit, agriculture, housing, and the environment. At a rough guess, these areas account for about 3% of the federal budget. You could slash their budgets by a third and still barely make a dent in federal spending. I suppose one of these days everyone&#8217;s going to have to figure this out. Apparently no time soon, though.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the comments at The Economist didn&#8217;t appear to be much different in tone and content than other sites. However, my bet is he who frames successfully for the moment&#8217;s advantage will win, and the budget itself will remain less relevant.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Some time ago, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/11/health-care-reform-and-caregivers.html">I noted </a>the difference between the provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which reduces the scheduled generosity of payments to hospitals, nursing homes and home health care agencies and the formula in a 1997 bill which was supposed to reduce the generosity of payments to doctors and which is waived once each year by the now traditional annual doc fix.   The difference is that many doctors with office practices refuse to treat Medicare patients and, as far as I could tell with a half hour of googling, no hospitals refuse to tread Medicare patients.   My view is that the new provision will actually be applied, because institutional care providers just can’t afford to say no to the CMS.</p>
<p>Now Jonathan Chait notes that Jeffrey H. Anderson deals with this important difference by lying.   Chait doesn’t explain why the difference is important, but his catch is amazing.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>First note Anderson is not an obscure hack.  Chait wrote “Jeffrey H. Anderson, who has been writing about health care for National Review, the Weekly Standard, the Washington Times, the American Spectator, and Investor&#8217;s Business Daily.”  <br />Now note that he most definitely is a hack.   <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/jonathan-chait/the-conservative-misinformation-feedback-loop-contd#comments">Chait wrote</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Anderson proceeds to cite the Congressional Budget Office …. He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The CBO begs to differ: “The provisions that would result in the largest budget savings include these: permanent reductions in the annual updates to Medicare’s payment rates for most services in the fee-for-service sector . . . yielding budgetary savings of $186 billion over 10 years.” That’s the physician pay cut.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anderson provided no link or citation for this quote. It turns out to come from a December 19 CBO letter (page 10) to Harry Reid, assessing the cost of the Senate health care bill, which is not actually the final version. But never mind that. Anderson, if you noticed, inserts an ellipses into the quote from the CBO. Here is the entire quote. I&#8217;ve bold-faced the part omitted by Anderson:</p>
<blockquote><p>Permanent reductions in the annual updates to Medicare’s payment rates for most services in the fee-for-service sector <strong>(other than physicians’ services), </strong>yielding budgetary savings of $186 billion over 10 years.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Oh my.  Notice that the elided text proves that Anderson&#8217;s claim is a lie.</p>
<p>By the way, the figure $ 186 billion over 10 years is lower than I thought.  Consider the expansion of medicaid enrollment predicted to be about 16 million.  If the CMS will send $ 1,200 per medicaid enrollee per year to hospitals etc then the bill will increase the flow of money from the CMS to hospitals etc.  <a href="http://www.civicfed.org/iifs/blog/medicaid-expansion-under-healthcare-reform-be-funded-mostly-feds">Medicaid spending is roughly $ 2,000 per enrollee now in Illinois now.  This is lower than in most states and, you know, health care spending is growing quickly.  </a><br />I don&#8217;t know what fraction of medicaid spending goes to hospitals nursing homes and home health care agencies, but, it seems to me that the ruthless cut will amount to the same money going from the same CMS to the same institutional care providers and the only change is that the CMS will pay bills for more patients and pay less for each bill.  I don&#8217;t think that hospitals etc are currently getting much from the people who will get medicaid coverage who are poor.</p>
<p>Also the individual mandate and subsidies will cause an increase in money flowing from private health insurance companies to hospitals.  I see no economic problem at all with actually imposing the $ 186 billion in compensation cuts.  Of couirse that doesn&#8217;t mean I confidently predict that congress won&#8217;t waive them &#8212; hospitals have a lobby.</p>

<p>Alice Rivlin spoke at Wayne State University&#8217;s FOCIS forum today on the economic crisis. Rivlin is an economist who served as the first director of the Congressional Budget Office (1975-83, when she was a critic of &#8220;reaganomics&#8221;), director under Clinton of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) (deputy 1993-94, director 1994-96) and a governor and vice chair of the Federal Reserve (1996-1999). She is currently associated with the Brookings Institution. She is slated to play a role in the policy decisions made on important economic and tax matters: As of January 2010, she has assumed a role as co-chair (with Pete Domenici&#8211;who was an avid supporter of the Bush budget-busting tax cuts) of a &#8220;Debt Reduction Task Force&#8221; sponsored by the Bipartisan Policy Center&#8221;. See Bipartisan Policy Center, press release, <a href="http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/news/press-releases/2010/01/bipartisan-policy-center-launches-debt-reduction-task-force" target="_blank">Bipartisan Policy Center Launches Debt Reduction Task Force</a>, Jan. 25, 2010. In addition, she was recently appointed by Obama to serve on the &#8220;National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility Commission&#8221; he established by executive order on Feb. 18, 2010, with co-chairs Erskine Bowles and Alan Simpson, with the charge of proposing ways to improve the long-term fiscal outlook and specifically to address the growth in &#8220;entitlement&#8221; spending. See the description by Peter Orszag, OMB director, on The <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/02/18/welcoming-national-commission-fiscal-responsibility-and-reform">White House Blog</a>.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help that note that Pete Domenici&#8211; in spite of claiming to spend his career seeking &#8220;deficit reduction&#8221; (along with other things such as &#8220;a strong military,&#8221; which is a substantial reason for our spending-heavy budget), see <a href="http://newmexicoindependent.com/1413/does-john-mccain-get-mad-ask-pete-domenici">Does John McCain get mad? Ask Pete Domenici</a>, New Mexico Independent, Apr. 21, 2008 &#8212; was an avid supporter of the Bush tax cuts, with a cost of $1.6 trillion over the first decade, even after it was clear that the Bush budget was in negative territory. See, e.g., 2 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/16/us/2-moderate-republicans-oppose-bush-tax-plan-as-democrats-offer-their-own.html">Moderate Republicans Oppose Bush Tax Plan As Democrats Offer Their Own</a>, NY Times, Feb. 16, 2001 (the two were Jeffords and Chafee, not Domenici); <a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/109/senate/2/votes/118/">Votes Database on HR4297</a>, Washington Post, May 11, 2006 (extending the capital gains rate reduction and the application of capital gains rates to dividends, against the argunent that it primarily benefited the wealthy and added to long-term deficit and debt problems).</p>
<p>Update:(Rdan here&#8230;formatting has been corrected)<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Both the commission and task force start out already adopting strongly urged positions of the right (military spending off the menu, tax increases sufficient to address the real problems can&#8217;t be considered, and reduction in benefits under the entitlement programs is a given). Like most of the talk of &#8220;bipartisanship&#8221; under the Obama administration, this has meant ceding key foundational principles to the right before discussion even begins of where compromises are necessary. It is why there is no public option in the deficient health care bill and why there is talk under a supposedly progressive Democratic administration of enacting a regressive national sales tax or VAT instead of letting the Bush taxes revert as scheduled at the end of 2010 back to the more sensible paradigm before the measures were enacted.]</p>
<p>Now, Alice Rivlin is a smart and accomplished woman. I was curious what she would say about the economic crisis and what needs to be done to get out of it. I&#8217;ll summarize (very sketchily) what she had to say and point out where I think she has gone wrong in her focus and prescriptions.</p>
<p>She repeated the current media story about the cause of the financial crisis&#8211;irresponsible borrowers, overleveraged lenders, lax regulators. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no one cause&#8221; she said&#8221; &#8211;you can&#8217;t blame it on Fannie Mae or any of those current whipping posts&#8221;. &#8220;Everybody got burned.&#8221; [exact quote]</p></blockquote>
<p>But<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;we are coming out of the problem and, as various economists predicted, 2010 will be the year of the upswing.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> [paraphrase] She pointed out, of course, the fact that unemployment numbers look better, that Wall STreet is doing better. And she indicated her great optimism for Michigan&#8217;s economy, because of the new realism in leaders&#8217; recognizing that the solution isn&#8217;t a return to the same old manufacturing base.</p>
<p>This last, which actually came towards the end and in response to a question asking for more specifics on her optimism for Michigan, was very vague and had the feel of puffery. She needed to say something good because this was a program on Michigan&#8217;s hope in Michigan and the media were watching.
<p>Then she named the two central issues to ensuring growth (she didn&#8217;t say &#8220;broad-based growth&#8221; regretably)&#8211;financial reform and deficit reduction. And her solution to these?</p>
<p>On financial reform, she listed three key reforms:</p>
<p>1. Re-instituting better standards/controls on lending and establishment of anindepedent consumer protection agency<br />2. Instituting controls on leverage through the Fed<br />3. Finding a way to deal with the &#8220;too big to fail&#8221; problem so that big financial institutions can be disbanded when necessary without disrupting the entire financial system.On deficit reduction, she claimed that the &#8220;budget scolds&#8221; have to be listened too, and that health care and social security entitlements have to be reduced. &#8220;Taxes aren&#8217;t enough, and cannot be the whole solution.&#8221; [close to exact quote]</p>
<p>Now, this has always been the right&#8217;s response when a progressive (or thought-to-be-progressive) is in office, as a way to constrain to the max any actually beneficial programs targeted at ordinary Americans and to lay claim to &#8220;fiscal responsibility&#8221; by noting how they pointed out when so and so was in office that deficit reduction should take priority. Remember Greenspan&#8211;when Clinton was president, Greenspan scolded about deficit reduction; then when Bush proposed huge deficit-creating tax cuts, Greenspan suddenly found himself not worried about deficits. (Remember too that the Clinton presidency left a budget in surplus, and by the time of the 2001 Bush tax cuts, we were already back in negative territory. So that Greenspan&#8217;s logic (if anything other than ideology) was hard to fathom.</p>
<p>So it is discouraging to see someone with Rivlin&#8217;s experience pushing deficit reduction in ways eerily reminiscent of the right&#8217;s focus. (I don&#8217;t think high debt is a good situation to be in, by the way. But I don&#8217;t think talking about cutting health care benefits is the right approach &#8211;certainly not til you&#8217;ve reduced military spending and raised taxes.)</p>
<p>So what are the solutions she envisions?</p>
<p>To summarize&#8230;decreasing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits&#8211;in the form of small changes now that will take effect and lead to significant reductions later, such as raising the retirement age and indexing for longevity for Social Security or working to ensure that we just &#8220;pay for the good stuff&#8221; through Medicare/Medicaid increasing taxes&#8211;in the form of a national sales tax or VAT which &#8220;will be pro growth&#8221; and will require the federal government to share some of the revenues with the states.</p>
<p>So what didn&#8217;t I like about this?</p>
<p>1. Undue Influence of Financial Institutions</p>
<p>On the causes of the crisis, her account glosses over the deeply embedded role of financial institutions in setting the laws and standards for their own accountability, from the fact that financial institutions were in bed with the ratings agencies, to the pervasive influence of the biggest banks (and especially Goldman Sachs through placement of its alumns in key positions) over Congress and over its own regulators, and the resultingly frustratingly toothless controls that those alumns put on the use of federal money to bail out the banks. Until that reality is acknowledged and dealt with transparently, there will be no workable long-term solution.</p>
<p>2. Lack of focused attention on the needs of ordinary Americans related to the crisis</p>
<p>While Rivlin acknowledges that the problems exist in Wall Street and in the regulators, there is, as with so many trained economists, almost no discussion of the impact of the crisis on ordinary Americans and the kinds of remedies that directly address their needs. Rivlin did acknowledge the high rate of unemployment, but primarily in emphasizing her view that the economic stimulus may have lessened to 10% the peak unemployment rate that could otherwise have been at 12%.</p>
<p>This vastly undervalues the harm done to ordinary society<br />by this crisis. The pockets of extraordinarily high unemployment create<br />devastating societal harms that returns to average levels don&#8217;t cure.</p>
<p>And we could do much more. One step, early on (and even now), would have a direct, palpable impact on the lives of the ordinary Americans who have been targeted by predatory Wall Street practices and in most cases who have worked hard but lost almost everything. That&#8217;s the change of the bankruptcy laws to permit modification of home loans in bankruptcy. The Obama administration (and of course the Bush administration before it) has not taken the kind of action it could to press for these changes. Why? Because that change would force banks to acknowledge losses that they can currently hide with &#8220;level 3&#8221; mark-to-market valuations and admit deeper losses than they want to acknowledge. This is an ostrich-hiding-its-head-in-the-sand solution that, like the way the TARP program has been administered, looks to the banks and makes them whole through socialization of losses while letting ordinary Americans continue to suffer through loss of their homes as well as their jobs. Many of those who are losing their homes were tconsidered prey by predatory mortgage brokers and predatory investment bank bond traders. There is no rational logic in not pushing through a program that allows modification of home loans for primary residences in bankruptcy. The picayune programs for interest rate reductions (mostly temporary) that have been the primary effort in this regard so far are laughable. The recently announced new effort by the Obama Adminstration doesn&#8217;t<br />sound much better. A change to the bankruptcy laws is necessary. </p>
<p align="left">3. Lack of any sense of the significance of creating laws that hold the guilty culpable </p>
<p>It is sad that policy makers like Rivlin never even mention the lack of<br />accountability in a system that, sense the Central Bank of Denver case, has let accountants, brokers, and lawyers off the hook when they design financial instruments for their own benefit that rip off their customers and/or rip off regulatory and tax authorities, keep information as hidden as possible through complex derivatives, and rely on &#8220;quants&#8221; to develop computer models to tell them how to make money without regard to the impact of their schemes on society or on individuals. Wall STreet bond traders, their lawyers, the ratings agencies, accountants and the various hedge funds that exist below any accountability radar screen bear the lion&#8217;s share of the blame for the financial crisis, and most of them are back to making millions without a qualm. Their predatory culture has to be dealt with, in order to protect all of us from a recurrence of this in the future.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the people who were treated as prey and got pushed into subprime mortgages that they couldn&#8217;t afford should be able to sue the broker, the traders, the rating agencies, and the lawyers that made that possible, in class-action lawsuits. (I know&#8211;the rating agencies convinced the courts that the rating that they are paid to provide and that are required for various legal purposes are &#8220;just opinions&#8221; and therefore<br />protected by the First Amendment. That&#8217;s seems like more of the corporatist agenda that lets corporations have all the benefits of being persons but none of the liability. Some way around it needs to be developed.)
<p align="left">4. Regulatory tightening for transparency and discouragement of risk-taking is essential. </p>
<p>1. Transparency is needed, but that won&#8217;t be achieved without SEC-like disclosure requirements on all financial innovations and FASB accounting rules that<br />minimize the amount of manipulation possible.<br />2. The changes that Congress forced in mark-to-market accounting (letting institutions decide to move to &#8220;level 3&#8221; mark-to-model valuations when there is a &#8220;market disruption&#8221; ) appear harmful, not beneficial. Mark-to-model needs to be revised drastically to require complete openness about individual positions being marked to model (not just aggregate information) and complete transparency or even standardization of the models used. [See my tome on mark-to-market for tax on SSRN and the problems of manipulating income or losses to suit the financial statement needs or tax needs of the institutions]<br />3. Financial innovations generally need to be discouraged, not encouraged&#8211;perhapsthrough a combination of patent law changes (proprietary financial institution models should not be patent-eligible in the first place), regulatory hurdles, and new regulatory regimes. </p>
<p>
<p align="left">5. Starting out with a deficit concern that is set forth as justifying reduction in programs for the common welfare is problematic.</p>
<p>No we want quality health care for all? Then are there ways to achieve that to be considered? The answer is yes and yes. This country never really considered single-payer health care, the successful model in the developed world most likely because of the power of the big insurers and the unwillingness of those like Rivlin operating under the centrist economic legacy of Clinton (Rubin, Rivlin, Summers, etc.) to put people first and make the arguments needed to help Americans understand that democratic capitalism cannot be sustained under the corporatist empire to which we are so rapidly moving. <br />By setting the charge of his &#8220;commission&#8221; to be reducing entitlements, Obama has regretably fallen into the pit dug by the rights efforts to treat programs that provide benefits for the poor or ordinary Americans as worrisome items while letting the programs for the Big Banks and other similar corporate welfare continue unabated.
<p align="left">6. Supporting a national sales tax or VAT as the tax solution is similarly problematic</p>
<p>Those tax systems are highly regressive, which is the wrong direction for us to move after the Bush tax cuts led to a less progressive system. We have various better alternatives, including at least the following: </p>
<p>a. eliminating the capital gains preference</p>
<p>b. increasing the progressivity of the income tax through both base broadening (eliminating or reducing the provisions that primarily provide redistribution upwards to the wealthy because they are the only ones able to take advantage of them, such as the charitable contribution for value of stock with low basis) and rate increases (adding more finely tuned rate brackets, so that those with millions are taxed higher than those with half a million and those with billions are taxed considerably higher than those with millions)</p>
<p>c. letting the Bush tax cuts lapse as they are scheduled to do by law as enacted by the GOP-dominated Congress that passed them</p>
<p>d. instituting a financial institution leverage tax that charges the financial institutions for the cost-of-funding advantage they receive due to the implicit federal guarantee</p>
<p>e. reinstituting the estate tax at a vigorously progressive rate (which will tax individuals when they are at a point where they don&#8217;t feel it and will help to slow the development of oligarchy)

                                <p>Robert Waldmann </p>
<p>is still trying to get Paul Krugman to read my answer to his question.  Krugman explaines the neo-Austrian view of the business cycle and unemployment during recessions and asks</p>
<p>&#8220;why isn’t there similar unemployment during the boom, as workers are transferred into investment goods production?&#8221;</p>
<p>I answer (in comments and here)</p>
<p>I think that there is a simple answer to your question.  However, the answer implies that market outcomes are not efficient and therefore is abhorred by Austrians.  </p>
<p>Labor market rents.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In my view, there is overwhelming evidence that the same worker is paid different wages if he works in different sectors.  In particular, workers are paid high wages in manufacturing and lower wages in services.  I think that&#8217;s what makes the shift from capital goods production to consumer goods and services production painful, while the opposite shift is not painful.</p>
<p>Consider a simple economy with steel mills and fast food joints.   In an expansion people make steel and eat bread.  In a contraction, they don&#8217;t make steel and drown their sorrows in big macs and thick shakes (here the key defining feature of fast food is that production of fast food is labor intensive &#8212; that is people eat fast food when there is spare labor because it takes time and I have totally messed up my metaphors and oh hell).</p>
<p>Your argument is &#8220;Look if steel mills have no trouble attracting new workers who have to quit their jobs at McDonald&#8217;s in a boom, why does it take a long time for workers laid off from a steel mill to get a job at a McDonald&#8217;s in a contraction.&#8221;  I think if you put it that way and say that economists are struggling to find an answer, then you will manage the very difficult accomplishment of making normal people&#8217;s opinion of us lower than it is already.</p>
<p>I think the problem with the Austrians is not that they are allergic to equations.  It is that they have blind faith that labor markets clear.  This makes it, ahem, a bit difficult to explain unemployment.  Their problem is that they know what everyone else knows but won&#8217;t let it into their non models.</p>

<p>Detroit&#8217;s spring, anti-government rhetoric, and the importance of paying taxes</p>
<p>Dear Readers:</p>
<p>As you know, I&#8217;ve been offline for a few days.  Spent a very nice holiday enjoying the outdoors.  Spring has sprung in Michigan.  Daffodils are blooming, bobbing their gay yellow heads in various corners of the yard where I tucked bulbs in last fall.  Tulips have surged upwards like the subprime market before the crash&#8211;any day I&#8217;ll see that bright red, pink and purple that makes one sure that the world can&#8217;t be all that bad.  I&#8217;ve planted quite a few fruit trees on my 3/4 acre in the &#8220;New Center&#8221; area of Detroit (Boston-Edison, to be exact).  Cherries and ornamental pears will likely start opening blossoms today.  Plums are in line close behind.  Peaches appear set to be loaded again this year.  Apples are slower&#8211;even the crabapple hasn&#8217;t yet shown its buds.  Mulberries, grapes, kiwis, elderberries.  This will be the third full year I&#8217;ve lived in Detroit, and the time when most of my earlier labor at planting will pay off. </p>
<p>Infrastructure is like that.  You need to plan, and you need to do a lot of hard work.  And eventually, the infrastructure supports the development you foresaw when you started.  Short term thinking doesn&#8217;t get you very far.  Oh sure, you can plant a gazillion annuals and you might get a raucous splash of color for the season.  But it is lacking compared to the recurring beauty of perennials and trees that work together to provide food for humans, birds, squirrels while cleaning the air, beautifying the landscape, and just adding grace to human existence.  </p>
<p>The US needs to do better at long-term planning, and one of the most encouraging things this year in Detroit is that we just might get our act together to do that.  With some support from federal tax revenues, some creative thinking, and sheer determination, Detroit may be able to downsize and upgrade at the same time.  It will require a lot&#8211;demolition of vacant and decayed properties that will cost money and not bring rewards til several years down the road; construction of public/private facilties like sports arenas, the riverwalk, bridges, and the Cobo Center; creation of a real public transportation system for the future (light rail); bicycle trails (we already have cyclists down our one-way street on Third every weekend); and new ideas like urban farming (if they can figure out what to do about the high lead level in the Detroit earth).  Most important, though, is improvement of the schools.  That means taxpayer dollars and volunteer hours.  Encouragingly, Detroit Public Schools&#8217; new volunteer program for a three-year commitment to two preschoolers has more than 5000 participants. </p>
<p>There is hope in Detroit, and hope in the country.  But we have to achieve a balance between holding government officials accountable, which is terribly important, and helping government officials do their job by supporting government programs and understanding the importance of taxation as the necessary foundation for good government that does many things for its citizens that citizens cannot do for themselves. </p>
<p>Spring is a time of renewal.  Let&#8217;s think of it as a time to cut out the ideological hate rhetoric, and get down to the business of governing ourselves in ways that help ordinary Americans lead better lives.  That would be by far the best antidote to the growing problem of oligarchy and corporatism in this country!</p>

                                <p>In case you haven’t noticed, I have become slightly less “optimistic”  about the prospects of a sustainable U.S. recovery. I used to think that  the household deleveraging story was more of a decade-long project, and the economy would cycle throughout. But recent deficit hysteria has  me worried; income growth might lapse.</p>
<p>What differentiates this recovery from every other cycle since 1929 is the lingering debt deflationary pressures. There is a very large overhang of U.S. household financial leverage that’s going down one of two ways: the easy way, through nominal income growth, or the hard way, by default. Unfortunately, the hard way is rearing its ugly head.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7qD_aAEA4I/AAAAAAAAC_s/gqt-sJG9Azo/s1600/leverage_chart.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7qD_aAEA4I/AAAAAAAAC_s/gqt-sJG9Azo/s400/leverage_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart above illustrates private-sector financial leverage (debt burden). Not a surprise; but, the real leverage problem is in the household sector, and to a much lesser degree, the non-financial business sector. Household debt burden is the ratio of the debt stock (generally mortgages outstanding plus consumer credit) to income flow (personal disposable income), while “de-leveraging” is reducing this debt burden.</p>
<p>Given that the burden has a numerator (debt stock) and a denominator (income), de-leveraging can occur through either variable. As such, I see three (general) de-leveraging scenarios (See an earlier <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/publications/us_consumers/">McKinsey  stud</a>y on the  consumer for a broader discussion):</p>
<p>1. If there is no income growth, then households must manually pay down debt at the cost of current consumption. The consumption decline drags the economy, and some default results.</p>
<p>2. If income growth is positive, then the degree to which households must pay down debt at the cost of current consumption will depend on the pace of income generation. This is the most macroeconomically-benign scenario.</p>
<p>3. If income growth is negative, i.e., deflation, then real debt burden rises. 30-yr mortgage payments, for example, are fixed in nominal terms and become more difficult to meet as income declines. In this case, widespread default is likely.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Of course, these are just three broad categories, but I believe that my point has been made. Clearly, choice 2. is optimal. However, evidence is pointing to a de-leveraging process that is more of the 1. and/or 3. type, especially as the federal stimulus effects run dry (although I have noted before that there is room for error in the <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/saving-rate-paradox.html">measurement of the income data</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7qD_P-vAmI/AAAAAAAAC_k/m9q1dm0zU68/s1600/income_chart.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7qD_P-vAmI/AAAAAAAAC_k/m9q1dm0zU68/s400/income_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart illustrates annual growth of disposable personal income minus annual growth of disposable personal income less government transfer receipts (DPI – DPIexT). The variable DPIexT proxies the personal income growth currently generated by the private sector only. Note: this is a calculated number, based on the BEA’s monthly personal income report (Excel data <a href="http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/pi/2010/xls/pi0210.xls">here</a>). The spread has never been wider, 2.1% Y/Y DPI growth over DPIexT growth in February, spanning every recession since 1980.</p>
<p>The government is propping up income (as it should be). Spanning February 2009 to February 2010, DPI averaged 1.2% Y/Y growth per month, while DPIexT averaged -1.1% Y/Y per month.  Further, since the onset of the recession DPIexT fell an average 0.03% M/M (over the previous month), while DPI grew 0.18% M/M.</p>
<p>The economy has crossed the threshold <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/04/the-recession-is-over.html">and is expanding</a> – phew! However, without a burst of export income, it’s going to take a lot more than <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t17.htm">123,000 private payroll</a> jobs per month to free the economy of its fiscal crutch. (I debated whether or not to use the term “crutch” when applying it to fiscal policy because fiscal policy is not a crutch; but the metaphor works.)</p>
<p>Households WILL drop leverage further; it’s just a matter of how smoothly.</p>
