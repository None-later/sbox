                                <p>Nothing sinister. The Social Security and Medicare Annual Reports are released together each year because each interacts deeply with the other. The new Health Care Reform law significantly changes Medicare and so the Obama Administration decided to update its numbers to match the new reality. Which makes sense. But expect opponents to mount a hissy fit about Obama &#8216;hiding&#8217; something.</p>
<p>Because that is what they do.</p>
<p>Consider this an open thread.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Trust is the unspoken assumption in discussions of public policy.  So what is trust?</p>
<p>Trust can work two ways, as faith (a belief based on the insubstantial, the future and other truths placed offstage) and as considered belief based on onstage facts and past experience.  Like many troublesome English words, these ideas are opposites, but they share the same short and slippery designation.  Call them, for this essay, faith-trust and fact-trust.</p>
<p>So, when the mother has just heard her son is in jail for car theft and break and enter, she might say, “He couldn’t have done that, he’s a good boy, I trust him completely,” and the newspapers will dutifully repeat this but no-one thinks it is evidence of anything.  She may be right, she may be wrong, but her motherhood mandates that faith-trust will rule her public speech, if not her private doubts.</p>
<p>Conversely, when I set out to cross a footbridge, I calculate whether it will support me based on my previous experience with construction materials, my observation of this specific bridge, my knowledge of my own weight (don’t ask), and by watching other people and vehicles crossing the bridge before I do.  When I choose to cross, I may be right, or I may end up in the river (because trust is all about making guesses about consequences) but I have used a totally different form of “trust” in making that choice.</p>
<p>At this point I imagine you are asking what this has to do with economics and governance.  Answer:  it is the hidden element that explains a lot of inexplicable public choices.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The Bush administration was a secretive bunch who pushed over their 8 years to stow more and more information into hidden places, whether via “national security” classification or black-site  jails or offshore prisons or even lost-destroyed e-mail messages and videos.</p>
<p>Why did many people accept all this secrecy?  The hidden element, never spoken out loud, was:  “They do this to protect the USA – we trust them.”  Which trust-twin is this one?  Faith-trust.</p>
<p>Take another example: the conduct of the police, with or without Tasers.  In spite of some apparently blatant misuse of their power they are virtually never convicted of assault, murder, manslaughter etc.  Also, in court their testimony is given weight far beyond the average witness, when a little thought would wonder if this is justified.  It seems to me a large element of faith-trust is present here, too.</p>
<p>And then there is the problem of trust accorded to clergy.</p>
<p>Now secrecy, prevarication and promise breaking are, sadly, all necessary elements of governance, whether good governance or bad.  Use of force is an essential part of police practice, and religious practitioners work in a realm between worlds, where confidentiality and metaphorical, story-based thought are central, and divine logic can appear to run counter to the worldly.</p>
<p>Given these necessities, how are we to differentiate honest stewards and good guardians from plutocrats and well-spoken thugs?  And how, in self-defense, do we detect and detach ourselves from the injurious objects of our faith-trust? </p>
<p>And then there is the other side of faith-trust – faith-distrust.  How do we examine the things we have demonized – or which have been demonized for us – and reclaim them if we discover we have been wrong?</p>
<p>Fear and hatred are often called “only human,” but this is not true.  Our animal cousins share with us the capacity for fear and anger.  Very few things, in fact, are “only human.”  Fear is useful to us and our cousins alike, because we learn from it.</p>
<p>But there’s a problem.  As the old saying goes, “The cat, once burned, stays off hot stoves.  The trouble is, he stays off all stoves.”</p>
<p>In the Tea Party movement, we see the “all stoves” response to government.  Having spent a generation, from Reagan onwards, with a government that told them over and over that “government is the problem, not the solution,” while proving this point by changes in law and regulation that squeezed them and removed many protections,  they now have fully formed faith-distrust of anything called government.</p>
<p>The problem is that only government, good government, has the power and mandate to correct the maltreatment of bad government.  Not business, not finance, not private militias, not NGOs, not churches – only government.  Their faith-distrust cuts them off from the primary lifeboat &#8212; however leaky it may be &#8212; that can get them clear of the wreck.</p>
<p>Fact-trust is one of the elements of humanity that we can call &#8220;only human.&#8221;  To stand outside our own fears and use our minds to judge and our will to go against our habits and prejudices, is a very uncommon and very human skill.  Fact-trust is less rigid than faith-trust, and is subject to constant recalibration.  But it is the only guide that will equip the maltreated US public to choose correctly and comprehend the shell game they’ve been drawn into.</p>
<p>Whoever feeds you falsehoods feeds you poison, and whoever undercuts fact-trust and replaces it with faith-trust is blinkering and hobbling you, reducing your &#8220;only-humanity.&#8221;.  Faith-trust is not always injurious, but itself must be subject to scrutiny on a regular basis.  And what form might that scrutiny take?</p>
<p>I suggest another old saying:  “By their fruits shall ye know them.”</p>

                                <p>On my way out the door hopefully to score an iPad today. Meaning it is time for the haters to step up. I think this is going to be the greatest advance in human history since the second biggest advance, which of course was baked bread. (The biggest advance obviously being the genius that let grain spoil in exactly the right way to make beer.)</p>
<p>Some people have had iPads in their hands for 48 hours. Others are sickened to death over the hype. Here is your chance to express your opinion either way or on anything else at all prior to Bruce getting his hands on one.</p>
<p>Open tech thread. And yes I expect Ken H and I will have a colloquy on this.</p>
<p>(BTW as an additional hook. There is a theory that credits the transition from hunter/gathering to settled agriculture to the need to have a steady supply of grain to make beer. Not kidding at all.)</p>

                                <p>The New York Times <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/03/business/03roberts.html">notes the passing of an important man</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Gates knew what many had forgotten: that Dr. Roberts had made an early and enduring contribution to modern computing. He created the MITS Altair, the first inexpensive general-purpose microcomputer, a device that could be programmed to do all manner of tasks. For that achievement, some historians say Dr. Roberts deserves to be recognized as the inventor of the personal computer. </p>
<p>For Mr. Gates, the connection to Dr. Roberts was also personal. It was writing software for the MITS Altair that gave Mr. Gates, a student at Harvard at the time, and his Microsoft partner, Paul G. Allen, their start. Later, they moved to Albuquerque, where Dr. Roberts had set up shop. </p>
<p>Dr. Roberts died Thursday at the Medical Center of Middle Georgia, his son Martin said. He was 68. </p>
<p>When the Altair was introduced in the mid-1970s, personal computers — then called microcomputers — were mainly intriguing electronic gadgets for hobbyists, the sort of people who tinkered with ham radio kits. </p>
<p>Dr. Roberts, it seems, was a classic hobbyist entrepreneur. He left his mark on computing, built a nice little business, sold it and moved on — well before personal computers moved into the mainstream of business and society&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Economic Views &#8211; a Thought Brought About by Yves Smith&#8217;s (Excellent Book) Econned</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still reading Econned, by Yves Smith. Sadly, these days I only have two minutes here or five minutes there. One day I will post something about everything going on right now, but that&#8217;s for another time.</p>
<p>Anyway, its not a breezy book, but if you are willing to put in the effort, it is perhaps the best critique of where the economics field is right now that I have come across. I highly recommend it.</p>
<p>But I do have a quibble. Smith talks about how economists have built up a practice that makes a fetish of using fancy and elegant math. However, doing so often requires crazy, unrealistic assumptions, which might be OK, except that the predictions usually have very little to do with the real world either. Thus, GIGO.</p>
<p>However, Smith notes that somehow, economists whose models are based on silly assumptions and produce unrealistic outcomes are nevertheless very respected and have a seat at the policy table &#8211; a seat, incidentally, that is denied to those who don&#8217;t understand the math &#038; models, or even other economists who think that unrealistic outcomes are a problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps the reason I agree with Smith is that I&#8217;ve stated similar things here at AB for the past few years. Consider the following graph, variations of which I&#8217;ve posted a few times last year here at AB:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S7ke-i8CVtI/AAAAAAAAAAc/DDlfTxK6NGA/s1600/yves.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/S7ke-i8CVtI/AAAAAAAAAAc/DDlfTxK6NGA/s320/yves.bmp"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>(Quick notes&#8230; the data comes from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2009&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaBox=no#Mid">the BEA&#8217;s NIPA Table 7.1</a>, and the graph shows the annualized change from the year before a President takes office to his last full year in office. For those leaving mid-term due to death or resignation, the last full year is the calendar year prior to departure if the Presidency ended in the first half o the calendar year. Note also that I&#8217;ve posted a few graphs showing that FDR still outperforms all comers even when you stop his term in 1938, in the middle of a big recession. Additionally, the Democrats outperform Republicans even if you eliminate the best performing Democrat and the worst performing Republican.)</p>
<p>Now, I like this graph because it is simple, and it makes a few points very easily. There is no amount of massaging this that can make it compatible with Republican/Austrian School/Libertarian dogma. (And yes, Obama isn&#8217;t on this&#8230; and he may yet underperform&#8230; but then, FDR inherited the Great Depression, and his first year was much worse than Obama&#8217;s.)</p>
<p>Personally, if I believed in Republican/Austrian School/Libertarian, I&#8217;d either be putting a heck of a lot of time and effort into explaining why the results don&#8217;t apply, or, if I could not come up with a home run explanation, I&#8217;d give up my views. And that, btw, is what happened. I graduated from high school in the mid-80s, and I believed in Reagan the way, well, folks who call themselves Republican/Austrian School/Libertarian believe in him now. But some time in college I started looking at data, and realized that the data simply didn&#8217;t match the pretty story, and my choice was to go with the data or go with the pretty story. The fact that members of these dogmas don&#8217;t know or care that reality doesn&#8217;t fit their beliefs makes me a bit leery of other things they believe in as well. And yet, Republican/Austrian School/Libertarian is now the dominant paradigm. Even most Democrats believe cutting taxes, for instance increases growth &#8211; they just feel that even so, in most cases, the non-growth related benefits of keeping taxes higher (say, to pay for certain programs) makes it worth not cutting taxes in many instances.</p>
<p>But Smith goes farther. Consider this: &#8220;the assume that only they are qualified to opine about matters economic.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree with part of this. I don&#8217;t think one needs to be an economist to opine about matters economic, especially when so many economists hold views that contradict reality. But plenty of ordinary people have views that diverge from reality at least as much as your typical U of Chicago econ prof. My bet is that most people at a Tea Party gathering would consider the graph posted above to be a hoax. If they were paid to spend a few minutes working out the results themselves, that probably wouldn&#8217;t change their minds. My bet is most of them would simply get angry.</p>
<p>Economics is not rocket science. Its not even civil engineering. (And no, I do not want Joe Sixpack opining on exactly how much concrete should go into the bridge that I&#8217;ll be driving on, thank you very much.) So what can be done to make it more likely that people making decisions have at least some vague passing acquaintance with reality?<br />________________________-<br />by cactus</p>

<p>The GDP recovery is underway. But below the GDP hood, the picture is not as bright. The labor market is weak, and income-generating prospects remain muted. The latter portends a back-up of consumer spending down the road without substantial policy support.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/04/employment-report.html">Spencer&#8217;s post</a> for a very nice interpretation of today&#8217;s employment report, but he sums it up quite nicely:<br />
<blockquote>Yes, the employment situation has quit deteriorating, and there are encouraging details within the report. But the overall rebound in the economy and the employment situation is one of being stuck in the doldrums.</p></blockquote>
<p>But why is the U.S. economy stuck in the doldrums? Isn&#8217;t GDP recovering smartly? (Read on.)<br /><a name="more"></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YaKyh7UcI/AAAAAAAAC-s/grO__g9oBmU/s1600/gdp_chart.PNG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YaKyh7UcI/AAAAAAAAC-s/grO__g9oBmU/s400/gdp_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart illustrates the GDP contraction for each recession since 1971, except that for 2001 because in sum <a href="http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">GDP did was rather flat</a>. Point &#8220;0&#8221; represents the quarter where GDP bottoms out. I circumvent the official date of the recession&#8217;s end as point 0 &#8211; <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">the NBER</a> is the agency that &#8220;dates&#8221; business cycles in the U.S. &#8211; because I want to focus on GDP, which is a composite of spending motives (including the government).</p>
<p>On the surface, the economy appears to be improving smartly; GDP bounced back 1.9% since its cyclical low in Q2 2009. But what we&#8217;ve really got here is a inventory-led recovery, with a Q3 boost from auto sales, and depreciated capital and software that must be replaced. Top that off with a small boost from non-defense federal government consumption, where in Q4 that was more than offset by the decline in the contribution to growth coming from state and local governments, and the recovery looks a little less stable.</p>
<p>I work in fixed income. Companies that wish to rollover debt or finance an expansion of capacity may do so through a public bond issuance. As an anecdote, companies will travel to our offices in order to &#8220;tell their story&#8221; and garner support for the issuance. Guess how many companies have told me that the proceeds of the bond issuance (essentially borrowing funds from the institutional investor at usually a fixed coupon rate) will finance expansion and new production capacity &#8211; none this year! Nada. (Actually, that&#8217;s not totally true: earlier this year an Indonesian power company wanted to rollover debt financed new capacity from last year.)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s plenty of <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/TCU?cid=3">spare  capacity</a>, so that existing resources can supply new demand. However,  this portends (in my very small sample) a slowdown in fixed investment growth,  and further crimps hopes for a strong recovery.</p>
<p>Jobs growth needs to pick up, or else income and earnings growth will continue down (or at best move sideways).<a href="javascript:void(0)" target=""><br /></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YhQ6MNQKI/AAAAAAAAC_U/L3RWfhtGlHc/s1600/payroll_chart.PNG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YhQ6MNQKI/AAAAAAAAC_U/L3RWfhtGlHc/s200/payroll_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YhQcytq5I/AAAAAAAAC_M/c0HHqgydMsg/s1600/earnings_chart.PNG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S7YhQcytq5I/AAAAAAAAC_M/c0HHqgydMsg/s200/earnings_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>It is NOT the time for government support to let up. Don&#8217;t worry about what markets think, worry about what people think. They can&#8217;t move; and they can&#8217;t find a job (well at least officially 9.7% of the labor force, or the 9.1m part-time for economic reasons workers). As such, the hope for sizable private-sector income growth is looking negligible.</p>

                                <p>The 2010 Social Security Report is due out any day now and I thought I could lay some groundwork for a number based discussion of its implications. Starting with changes to the 75 year projection over time.</p>
<p>1996-2.19%<br />1997-2.23%<br />1998-2.19%<br />1999-2.07%<br />2000-1.87%<br />2001-1.86%<br />2002-1.87%<br />2003-1.92%<br />2004-1.89%<br />2005-1.92% <br />2006-2.02%<br />2007-1.96%<br />2008-1.70%<br />2009-2.01%<br />2010-??<br />Each Report Year the Trustees give an estimate of how much payroll tax would have to go up immediately to deliver Long Term Actuarial Balance, meaning full payment of scheduled benefits and a Trust Fund with a one-year reserve at the end of the 75th year. In this post I want to explore the reasons why this number can go either up or down over the course of a single year, sometimes in a pretty dramatic manner, how can one Report Year whip the tail by as much as +/- 10%? Geekiness under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The first thing to understand is that the bias in this number by rights should be upwards for two reasons. Consider 1998, in point of fact we did nothing in the faces of a 2.23% actuarial gap from the previous year, meaning that extra dollars were not collected and so contributed neither principal or interest to the Trust Fund, all things being equal this should have added to the cost of an ultimate fix, because as &#8216;everyone knows&#8217; the longer we wait the more any fix is going to cost. Well the numbers show that not to be true, in the face of inactivity the total cost can actually go down, why that is to be explored a little later. The second cause for an upward bias is the result of the change in valuation  period, in 1998 what had been year 1, that is 1997 dropped off, and what had been year 76 became the new year 75 and so got included. And the Trustees tell us that change alone will add 0.06% to the gap. Meaning that if we were 100% confident in our modeling we would expect to see an uptick in that amount each and every year.</p>
<p>Well a single glance at this time/number series shows that we are not justified in that confidence, when people claim that the Trust Fund &#8216;will&#8217; run dry in 2037, what they mean knowingly or not is &#8216;if every bit of our methodology is correct and so too all of our economic and demographic assumptions about the future&#8217;. Well obviously we don&#8217;t know what is going to be happening in 75 years, or even 10 years. For that matter only a handful of people not named Baker or Schiller were predicting this years economy even 3 years ago.</p>
<p>This uncertainty is fully recognized by the professionals in the SSA Office of the Chief Actuary, a fact that is shown in three ways. First the numbers above are drawn from is known as the Intermediate Cost alternative, the OACT also provides a more optimistic Low Cost alternative, and a more pessimistic High Cost alternative to present a range of possible outcomes. Second the OACT doesn&#8217;t pretend to be able to predict future business cycles after the first ten years, instead all of their economic number series under all three alternatives settle out into what are called the Ultimate values, and finally the OACT shows its work in the form of Sensitivity analyses and Stochastic projections that show how those outcomes vary in response to changes to individual variables and in light of past variations, all of which are published in the Annual Report.</p>
<p>Which leads me to my first conclusion here: Infinite Future is Hooey. Given the probabilistic variation revealed even over the medium term and particularly given that an outcome that shows the system fully funded over the 75 year period (which is the result of Low Cost), and given the substantial uncertainties in even year over year projections as revealed above trying to influence policy by an &#8216;Unfunded Liability&#8217; over the &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217; is not just misguided, it is thoroughly dishonest. Particularly given the time series.</p>
<p>In 1997 Social Security could still reasonably be said to be in crisis, the 2.23% projected actuarial gap had been steadily increasing over the few years before just as you would expect from a crisis left unaddressed, the fact that the system had finally reached a Trust Fund ratio of 100 in 1993 and so met the short term test did not mean the whole program was out of the woods, as long as the actuarial gap was ticking upwards there was good reason to &#8216;Save Social Security First&#8217;, after all under then current projections the Trust Fund would go to zero in 2029.</p>
<p>Well a funny thing happened, starting in 1998 the gap, even in the face of inactivity started to drop, in the first year just a little but in 1999 and 2000 by a lot, 10% improvement per year in a 75 year outlook. And it was in response to this that Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot published <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a> and I developed my own plan for Social Security which I cleverly dubbed &#8220;Nothing&#8221;. In 2000 Greenspan was happily assuring us that via the miracle of the Great Moderation we had conquered the business cycle and we could enjoy 3% productivity and 4% Real GDP forever. Numbers that if correct were far better than the ones of Low Cost which showed Social Security vastly overfunded going forwards.</p>
<p>Which leads to a second conclusion. When it came to Social Security the Bush Administration was thoroughly dishonest from the start, they promoted their tax cuts based on a set of economic numbers that if they had actually come about would have saved Social Security along the way. Yet they willfully ignored the number series above and convened a Social Security Commission that still relied heavily on the rhetoric of crisis and &#8216;we can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8217;. Well the hell we couldn&#8217;t, the ways the projected numbers were moving during Bush&#8217;s first term there was positive evidence that a short term policy of &#8220;Nothing&#8221; was in fact optimal.</p>
<p>As noted at the outset the natural bias in this series in the face of inactivity is upwards due to theoretical taxes not collected in the previous year combined with the built in increase due to change in actuarial balance. Leaving aside the specific reasons for changes in projections from year to year the fact that four years of inactivity from the time Bush was elected in 2000 to his re-election only increased the actuarial gap by 0.02% and even at that was down by 0.03% from the previous year made the whole Social Security Tour of Spring 2005 itself throughly dishonest. These numbers show clearly why &#8220;There is No Crisis&#8221; was a relatively easy campaign to win, our side had the numbers.</p>
<p>Well except one. In 2003 a new measure of Social Security solvency suddenly appeared in the Reports, instead of measuring the payroll gap over the standard 75 year window, the Trustees would add a new number projecting Intermediate Cost over the Infinite Future Horizon. Now given the existing probability range over even the first 75 years and the rapid changes in outlook seen since 1997 this was more akin to witch magic than anything, but it produced a very useful number on its own. All of a sudden the President&#8217;s Men could point away from a number that was under 2% and on balance shrinking and to a number that was almost twice as high at 3.5%. And they needed a number that high and badly because of something I pointed out in an adage coined in 1997:</p>
<p>&#8220;If privatization is necessary, it won&#8217;t be possible. If privatization is possible, it won&#8217;t be necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>For movement Republicans the real Social Security crisis was that it existed in the first place. But due to its general popularity a head-on assault was thought politically impossible, so in order to sell their ideologically preferable system of Private Accounts they were forced to play the solvency crisis card, and to present the better returns on equities as being the key to the solution. Unfortunately for them there were three problems here. One their models assumed traditional returns on stocks, which in turn required growth rates in line with historical trends, which rates if sustained were significantly better than those projected under Intermediate Cost assumptions. Hence the ditty above. A secondary problem is that along side their ideological commitment to Private Accounts was their even stronger commitment to tax cuts which had been sold on claims that such cuts would boost productivity. If tax cuts had actually worked as advertised then Social Security would have been saved from crisis along the way. A third problem was structural, any move from traditional Pay-Go Social Security to self-funded Private Accounts had to somehow handle the transition costs. And there was no way to do that at a cost to the worker that would not exceed the 1.89% payroll gap. Which would reasonably lead an informed worker to ask &#8220;Exactly what is in this for me that I should take this extra risk when I could just except the tax increase and guarantee a 100% benefit?&#8221;</p>
<p>And there was no answer to that in 2005, even the use of a 3.5% Infinite Future number didn&#8217;t rescue the calculations, there was no numerically based challenge to the proven plan of &#8220;Nothing&#8221;. To see why we have to look a little deeper at the numbers and what I call &#8220;The Cost of Inactivity&#8221;.</p>
<p>In 2001 the process of actual shrinkage in actuarial gap stalled. There is some reason to believe that this stalling was deliberately engineered so as not to make the sales job for private accounts even harder than it was. People in a position to know on both sides of the issue insist that deliberate manipulation of the numbers in the Report is impossible, but both Prof. Rosser and an originally skeptical Arne took a hard look at the internals of the data tables and numerically if not practically the case is pretty solid. But either way a steady number as seen from 2001-2005 is an irrefutable argument for &#8220;Nothing&#8221; for two reasons. One the same performance numbers that drove down and then kept steady the actuarial gap also moved the date of Trust Fund exhaustion out in time, between 1997 and 2005 the date of depletion had been pushed out from 2029 to 2042. Not only had that date been moving at more than a year per year, suggesting that the event itself would never happen, it was being pushed out past the point of maximum Boomer demographic impact, a close look at the numbers show that the thirty or so years after mid-century will be relatively easy on Social Security as it handles a cohort of Gen-Xers that is numerically smaller than the Boomers that will have moved off the stage and the still working Millennials behind. In 2005 the case for simply waiting out &#8216;Crisis&#8217; was excellent. Because every year of inactivity meant the functional equivalent of a tax cut in the amount of the fix not applied.</p>
<p>Well the case for &#8220;Nothing&#8221; got more problematic with the gyrating numbers from 2006-2009 and what is likely to be a disappointing number for 2010. Which is why I moved off &#8220;Nothing&#8221; to support the &#8220;NW Plan&#8221;. But in any event it is important that all decision making on this be driven by the numbers and not by slogans. And that means digging into the data tables and not relying on the MSM to bring you the news. Hopefully this post will help you cut through the spin certain to be coming down the road in the next couple of weeks after Report release.</p>

Well,<br />sometimes these employment reports make me feel like one of those crewmen.</p>
<p>Yes, the employment situation has quit deteriorating, and there are encouraging details within the report.  But the overall rebound in the economy and the employment situation is one of being  stuck in the doldrums.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7jPPs-hI/AAAAAAAABFw/ig5eWQglMsI/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7jPPs-hI/AAAAAAAABFw/ig5eWQglMsI/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />After the February snowstorms caused monthly hours worked and the index of aggregate hours worked to tick down,  this month showed the expected snap back in hours worked. We are now looking at the first quarter hours worked index rising at a 1.8% annual rate, the first quarterly gain since the recession began. With continued strong productivity gains this implies that first quarter real GDP growth is almost certain to exceed consensus expectations.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7PglHDUI/AAAAAAAABFo/KAyZ8cM6DxA/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7PglHDUI/AAAAAAAABFo/KAyZ8cM6DxA/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>However, much of the improvement in the hours worked index was offset by a drop in average hours earning.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7yuuCucI/AAAAAAAABF4/rr3uPcxFTE0/s1600/Clipboard03.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X7yuuCucI/AAAAAAAABF4/rr3uPcxFTE0/s320/Clipboard03.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Consequently, we are seeing a significant gain in average weekly earnings.  But it is not enough  to generate large gains in real income growth on the positive side, nor is it enough to scare the Fed into premature tightening on the negative side.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X687_EXcI/AAAAAAAABFg/UhLuJgueoD8/s1600/Clipboard01.jpg"><br /></a></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X8ukNeVTI/AAAAAAAABGQ/2eA9qz9Jwbw/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/S7X8ukNeVTI/AAAAAAAABGQ/2eA9qz9Jwbw/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />One of the encouraging details buried deep within the report is the large improvements in the diffusing index &#8212; another leading index of stronger employment.  But we have now seen several of these  leading indicators be positive for several months. It is time for them to actually lead to some strong employment numbers.</p>
