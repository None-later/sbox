                                <p>One of the memes used to justify corporate actions is &#8216;things are done to increase shareholder value&#8217;.  We all know &#8216;value&#8217; can be interpreted in different ways, oft times after the fact of actions since shareholder participation has rather cumbersome mechanisms for participation.  Maybe a new way will emerge to aid greater participation of more shareholders in what is done in their names.  </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/06/your-money/stocks-and-bonds/06money.html?pagewanted=all">The NYT</a> frames the question this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sure, in theory, investors could vote for the people who serve on the board, many of whom are paid handsomely to oversee management and set executive pay. But investors don’t have any say on the nominees. Nor do they have much of a real choice even if they do vote. Say you withhold a vote for a candidate running uncontested. It doesn’t matter, since directors can win without a majority. </p>
<p>And if you chose not to vote? Your broker is allowed to cast your ballot without your permission, and brokers typically vote in line with management. </p>
<p>&#8230;..</p>
<p>But the tide is beginning to turn, albeit slightly. In recent years, more companies have adopted a “majority rules” requirement, meaning a single vote can no longer elect the entire board, even if all other votes are withheld (though some companies retain the power to reinstate directors). And starting this year, brokers can no longer vote shares held in their customers’ accounts without permission. </p>
<p>On top of that, more voter resources are beginning to sprout on the Web that aim to educate smaller investors, demystify the issues on the ballot and make voting easier.</p></blockquote>

<p>Those of us who fear global warming want to make it more expensive to burn coal.  One way to do this is to impose absurdly high wages and restrictive work rules on coal mines.  We know how to drive prices up.  It is easy.  Militant unions have shown the way.</p>
<p>I propose the American Power and Give Coal Miners a Break Act.  The idea is to impose a special minimum wage for coal miners (which must be even higher than the wages they get) *and* to require time and a half if they work more than 30 hours a week.  This implies a higher price of coal, lower demand for coal , and, oh look 30 hours a week, just as many employed coal miners.  </p>
<p>More flaky anti market ideas after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The idea is to pit the coal miners against the coal consumers.  Resistance to cap and trade among Democrats is concentrated in coal mining states.  Buying off the coal miners is politically necessary.  It is easy to help workers at the expense of consumers.  If we want it to be expensive to consume coal, that’s what we want.</p>
<p>And coal price supports, let’s have coal price supports.  Why do farmers get all the subsidies ?</p>
<p>And tougher safety regulation, which  will drive up the price and make mines safer.  <br />Finally make exempt coal companies  from the Sherman antitrust act.  </p>
<p>The general idea is that regulators, unions, and cartels have vast experience in finding ways to hurt consumers.   There are some consumers (of electricity) who we want to hurt.  Let’s do what we do best, interfere with the market system to help special interests at the expense of consumers.</p>

<p>Ezra Klein shows a graph and writes </p>
<blockquote><p>What you&#8217;re <strike>seeing there</strike> [will see if you click <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/06/what_to_do_in_the_absence_of_c.html">this link</a>] is a projection for how our energy usage would change after 20 years of a Waxman-Markey-like cap-and-trade bill. As you can see, transportation &#8212; which is probably what most Americans think would be affected &#8212; would hardly change at all. The reason is that internal-combustion engines aren&#8217;t very carbon-inefficient. We&#8217;ve spent so much time regulating car emissions that we&#8217;ve actually done a pretty good job increasing efficiency.</p></blockquote>
<p>I comment<br />Klein’s idea that people imagine cap and trade will affect transportation a lot is very interesting.  I&#8217;m not sure you are right, but if you are, then I see a deal.<br />Cap, trade, and cut the gasoline tax.  That is have some of the cap and trade revenue go to the highway trust fund so the cost of gasoline stays the same (or falls).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>This sounds crazy. It is the last in the series of sacrificing goals of environmentalists to demonstrate that we really really care about cap and trade and you can bash tree huggers while voting for cap and trade*.  It will make environmentalists scream with rage.  Jane Hamsher will demand a filibuster.  That&#8217;s exactly what we need.  Make it the US power and cut the price of gas bill.  </p>
<p>The situation is desperate.  It might be time for one crazy insane political gambit appealing to the ignorant. When someone shouted to Adlai Stevenson &#8220;every thinking man is for you&#8221; he replied &#8220;That&#8217;s not enough, I need a majority.&#8221;  There is a majority for cap and trade, but the 21st century version is &#8220;that&#8217;s not enough I need 60 votes in the Senate.&#8221; and that takes uniting the forces of knowledge and ignorance.  Klein provides the knowledge and I&#8217;ll figure out how to appeal to the ignorant.</p>
<p>OK now I live in Italy and I think the US gasoline tax is insanely low.  I&#8217;m a US citizen and reflect on the folly of my countrypeople as I watch the Euros run up faster than the liters.  The idea of *cutting* the Us gasoline tax makes my head spin.  But a disfunctional polity  gotta do what a disfunctional polity gotta do.</p>
<p>Dear commenters whose nicknames I forget but I think one was CoRev.  When I had schemes to save the public option, you said I was pathetically refusing to face the fact that it was doomed.  You told me so.  You were right.  Please feel free to tell me so again.  I&#8217;m sure you will be right again, and I will note that you told me so and you were right when the final proof is available (probably soon).  </p>
<p>*Increased offshore drilling was the old trade.  That was such horrible policy that it can&#8217;t come to the aid of politics.  Increased subsidies for nuclear energy are pure hippy bashing (odd that the Republican position is that the government should meddle with the market with subsidies, there is no limit to their hypocrisy).</p>

                                <p><em><strong>by Roosevelt Institute Senior Fellow and Braintruster Marshall Auerback at the <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2010/06/09/the-united-kingdom-draws-the-wrong-lessons-from-canada-12009/" target="_blank">New Deal 2.0</a></strong></em></p>
<p>For once, Canada is making the news for the wrong reasons. The United Kingdom has braced the country for cuts in government spending up to 20 percent as the new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition lays the groundwork for an austerity program to last the whole parliament. Their inspiration? According to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/7807347/Britain-to-emulate-Canadas-radical-solution-to-tackle-debt.html">The Telegraph</a>, Prime Minister David Cameron’s administration hopes to draw lessons from the experiences of the Canadian Government of the 1990s. Before too much damage is done, we suggest they’d better re-read the history books a bit more closely.</p>
<p>The standard narrative of the Canadian experience in the 1990s is this: in 1993, Canada’s budget deficit and debt-to-GDP ratios were the second highest amongst the G7 countries, after Italy’s, and the US financial press was unfavorably comparing Canada to Mexico. That year, with the IMF supposedly lurking at the door, the Liberal Government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien, and his Finance Minister, Paul Martin, laid out a goal to halve the budget deficit to three percent by 1998, with an unannounced goal of a zero deficit by 2000. Martin began cutting costs significantly in 1994, chopping 10 percent from department budgets and converting a deficit equal to nearly 7 percent of gross domestic product into a surplus by 1997. By 1998, the deficit was eliminated and overall debt was dropping quickly, amidst a rapidly growing economy.</p>
<p>Success, correct? Certainly, this narrative has largely gone unchallenged (even in Canada). It has metamorphosed into received wisdom and has been used by many to justify a renewed assault on the welfare state. It is argued that the impact of Chretien government’s cuts in public spending allowed Canada to get through the Asian crisis with little damage and to go on to become one of the strongest Western economies.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />And this is the lesson drawn by the British government. Hence, the remarks of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, who <a href="http://www.blogger.com/yesterday%20announced">yesterday announced</a> an unprecedented four-year spending review. According to Osborne, every Cabinet minister will have to justify, in front of a panel of colleagues, every pound they spend. He said the task ahead represented “the great national challenge of our generation” and that after years of waste, debt and irresponsibility it was time to bring public spending under control, guided by the principle that people should ask “what needs to be done by government and what we can afford to do”.</p>
<p>The Canadian experience certainly makes for an interesting story, although we suspect that the IMF threat was significantly overstated. In 1995, Canada had a debt to GDP ratio that was around half of that of Italy and Belgium. Yet curiously, those countries were never deemed to be ready-made victims for the Fund’s Little Shop of Horrors, even as Canada was supposedly threatened with the prospect of becoming a ward of the IMF a la the United Kingdom in 1976. In truth, the IMF threat represented yet another in a series of manufactured crises that enabled longstanding opponents of government spending to muscle through budget cuts in vital and politically popular social programs.</p>
<p>The reality is somewhat more complex, as Professor Mario Seccareccia of the University of Ottawa has noted in a paper entitled, <a href="http://mqup.mcgill.ca/book.php?bookid=2080">Whose Canada? Continental Integration, Fortress North America, and the Corporate Agenda</a> (pp. 234-58). In the paper, Seccareccia noted the real reasons for the “success” of the Chretien/Martin austerity programs:</p>
<p>1. High growth in the US, Canada’s largest trading partner, a sharply declining Canadian dollar (which fell as low as .62 cents against the greenback), and the implementation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), all of which combined to push the export sector’s share of Canadian GDP to 45% by 2000 (now about 33%), and<br />2. An expansionary monetary policy which did significantly stimulate consumer spending, and which was sustained until the financial crisis.</p>
<p>The turnaround emerged despite the fact that investment remained weak relative to historic economic recoveries. But the massive turn in the country’s external sector was largely made possible through a revival of growth in the US (Canada’s largest trading partner). The stock market boom in the US, the high tech bubble, and the beginnings of the American real estate boom created huge demand for Canadian exports, which largely drove Canada’s recovery. (All of which were fueled by huge increases in US private debt growth, another malign effect of the Clinton budget surpluses.) If anything, this vast improvement in Canada’s external account largely offset the deflationary impact of the fiscal austerity which, in any case, likely impeded, rather than facilitated, economic recovery, given the slashing of employment insurance and social welfare benefits.</p>
<p>The other byproduct of this Canadian “budget miracle” was the increasing indebtedness of the Canadian private sector, a phenomenon mirrored in the US by the Clinton Administration, which repeatedly recorded budget surpluses in the late 1990s. Again, this is no surprise to those of us who adopt the <a href="http://wallstreetpit.com/8568-the-sector-financial-balances-model-of-aggregate-demand">financial balances</a> approach, but it does give a fuller (and less flattering) picture of the ultimate impacts of eliminating Canadian “fiscal profligacy”.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA_mZbj4CzI/AAAAAAAADCs/epvVhuBhBys/s1600/canada_chart.PNG"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA_mZbj4CzI/AAAAAAAADCs/epvVhuBhBys/s400/canada_chart.PNG"></a></p>
<p>The chart above highlights the importance of Canada’s restrictive fiscal policy in pushing the household sector balances increasingly into the red until the financial crisis of 2008 (also accompanied by a massive increase in the Canadian budget deficit, which almost certainly cushioned the impact of the crisis in Canada).</p>
<p>In any event, Canada’s export boom of the 1990s is a miracle that could certainly not be repeated today, given the decline in global economic growth, and the extent to which the ailing manufacturing exports sector is now being hammered by the so-called “<a href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dutchdisease.asp">Dutch disease</a>” as a consequence of the Canadian dollar’s relative strength.</p>
<p>By the same token, the United Kingdom would hardly do any better today, given global recessionary pressures and the corresponding implosion of its largest export markets in Europe and the US. If Prime Minister David Cameron is indeed preparing Britons for a Canadian-style attack on the deficit, he is acting on the basis of profoundly misguided historical information. Canada’s growth was largely stock market bubble-driven, so both the US budget surpluses and the Canadian miracle were based on a one-off fluke. From the sector balances approach, we know that unless you get something like one of the biggest bubbles of all time in your own economy or in a major trading partner’s, don’t count on recovery in the face of fiscal retrenchment. The UK government’s current monomaniacal fixation on deficits and its simplistic reading of Canadian history will do nothing more than cut back on vital stimulus that has cushioned the UK from a far greater disaster, all to satisfy the loons in the conservative press and some threatening types in ratings agencies . Not only would a Canadian-style fiscal assault be a nonsensical short-run strategy, given the debt levels the UK private sector is carrying at present, it would not be a sustainable growth policy in the medium-term. Eventually, the private balance sheets would become too fragile and households would attempt to increase saving even further. This would reduce aggregate demand further and income adjustments would force the public balance into an even larger deficit and set the deficit hawks toward cutting government spending with an even greater sense of urgency. The Canadian experience teaches us very little. There is never a case for fiscal austerity in periods of cyclical weakness unless you can recreate the conditions of a financial bubble. But aren’t we paying the price for that today?</p>

<blockquote><p>“Go long whatever Chinese consumers buy and go short Chinese capital spending (construction) plays. Consistently, go long tech/short material stocks.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That is the first sentence of a BCA Research report’s executive summary on China equity strategy (link not available). Rather than a global equity strategy, I’d like to put this into an economic growth context via trade…and with Europe.</p>
<p>Go long Eurozone economies selling to China? Is China the panacea for Eurozone growth?  Short answer is no, but we&#8217;ll attend to that later. Even if the euro wasn&#8217;t selling off against <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2010/06/08/254791/chart-du-jour-eurchf/">the</a> <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2010/06/04/252461/market-snapshot-euro-rout-us-stocks-roiled/">majors,</a> China&#8217;s domestic demand is robust and export income is flowing into the Eurozone &#8211; but to where?</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates the dynamics of annual export growth to China for the top 6 countries of the Eurozone measured by GDP in 2009: Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, and Belgium. Presumably, the bulk of China’s export demand would flow to these countries.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vKx6cU2I/AAAAAAAADCU/8RGT-yJV2mw/s1600/growth_exports_china.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vKx6cU2I/AAAAAAAADCU/8RGT-yJV2mw/s320/growth_exports_china.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>Since the Eurozone&#8217;s annual export growth to China bottomed out in May 2009, many of the Eurozone economies (some not shown in chart) have registered, on average, double-digit monthly export growth to China: Belgium 49% Y/Y, Germany 25%, Spain 16%, Greece 19%, Ireland 22%, Netherlands 39%, and Portugal 49%. Only Finland saw its monthly average export income drop over the same period, -10% Y/Y.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>(A note of clarification: the statistics in the chart are monthly Y/Y growth rates, while the statistics in the paragraph above represent the average monthly Y/Y growth rate spanning the period May 2009 to March 2010. All of this data can be downloaded from <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database">Eurostat</a>, EU27 Trade since 1995 by CN8).</p>
<p>But 75% of the Eurozone’s exports to China flow from just three countries: Germany, 54%, France, 11%, and Italy 10% (average Jan 2009 – Feb 2010 and see table below). This makes sense, given that Germany, France, and Italy are the three largest countries in the Eurozone.</p>
<p>However, compared to the size of their economies, Belgium and Germany are the true beneficiaries of China’s external demand, not Spain, France, nor Italy. And this trade data is truncated before the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#038;sid=a7EWJiwL2qjY">record decline </a>of the euro.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vLWGG-8I/AAAAAAAADCk/DPq7cKPoILk/s1600/share_table.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vLWGG-8I/AAAAAAAADCk/DPq7cKPoILk/s320/share_table.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The table above relates each country’s share of total Eurozone exports to China to its share of Eurozone GDP. I’d say that Belgium is doing quite well compared to its larger neighbors, +2.5% spread on a 3.8% share base. But Germany&#8217;s out of this world, 26.9% spread on a 26.8% share base. Spain, France, and Italy are faring poorly, as their spreads are wide and negative.</p>
<p>China appears to be the panacea for just a handful of countries, most notably Germany and Belgium. But alas, it’s no panacea for the Eurozone, not even for Germany. Unfortunately, the Eurozone&#8217;s fragile developed colleagues, the US and UK, are.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vLG0jyoI/AAAAAAAADCc/WjnoZKLS8xk/s1600/share_chart.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vLG0jyoI/AAAAAAAADCc/WjnoZKLS8xk/s320/share_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The shares illustrated in the chart are calculated for year 2009.</p>
<p>Markets anxiously await China’s every move; but according to the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/01/weodata/index.aspx">April 2010 IMF World Economic Outlook</a>, China ran the largest current account surplus across the IMF member countries &#8211; $284 bn in 2008 – the 20th largest as a share of GDP. That kind of saving is NOT going to get the global economy back on its feet in full very quickly. China is not the answer for Europe.</p>
<p>The Eurozone,  in particular, is paying close attention to non-Eurozone (16 countries  adopted the euro as their currency) growth alternatives. I leave you with an excerpt from a <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a7df74f6-7002-11df-8698-00144feabdc0.html">nice FT article</a> on Europe’s true woes – fiscal austerity measures &#8211; featuring the research of Wynne Godley and Rob Parenteau:<br />
<blockquote>Many years ago, he [Wynne Godley] also criticised the institutional arrangements of the European Monetary Union. Writing in The Observer in August 1997, he noted that members of the eurozone were not only giving up their currencies but also their fiscal freedom. Within the union, a government could no longer draw cheques on its own central bank but must borrow in the open market. “This may prove excessively expensive or even impossible,” he warned.</p>
<p>He went on to caution that without a common European budget, there was a danger that “the budgetary restraint to which governments are individually committed will impart a disinflationary bias that locks Europe as a whole into a depression that it is powerless to lift”.</p></blockquote>
<p>China is not the  answer: not for Europe; not for the US; and not for the UK.</p>

<blockquote>…[there is a] continued prevalence of corruption around the complex, lucrative, and transnational global infrastructure industry, <em>despite</em> limited efforts in the past few years to root it out. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s see: complex (difficult to understand and therefore regulate), lucrative, transnational (easier to create transactions and translational exposures), and facing “limited efforts” at control.  Would anyone—even William Easterly—even consider the possibility that this is not an area more subject than most to regulatory capture at best, and corruption as the norm?</p>
<p>Other sentences we should expect from Mr. Peel:</p>
<blockquote><p>SEC enforcement officials remain overburdened and behind despite Christopher (“Uh, two plus two?  Pass me a calculator.”) Cox having been replaced as its Chair.</p>
<p>BP leadership still want their lives back despite their recent ability to capture almost 10% of the oil escaping from their Deep Horizon drilling site.</p>
<p>Chernobyl-area lumber sales continue to be made primarily in the grey market to unsuspecting customers despite the leak that irradiated those trees being almost twenty years old.</p>

                                <p>It appears that someone (who I am sure has family income under $250,000 per year and is just interested in social science) contests my view that families with income over $250,000 per year are rich.  He or she notes that two earner families can be rich by working real hard and that price levels are high in some parts of the country, so $250,000 doesn’t buy as much as it buys in other parts of the country.</p>
<p>One can look at two earner families only.  $250,000 will be huge compared to the income of most two earner families.  The vast majority of two earner families have incomes under $250,000 / year.  This remains true of a very large majority after making an absurdly generous correction for local price levels.</p>
<p>Calculations after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see.  <a href="http://pewsocialtrends.org/pubs/?chartid=537">In 2006 44.9 % of married couple families had two earners</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States">The Wikipedia claims that, according to the US census bureau, in 2004 51.35% of households were married couple families.</a>  </p>
<p>According to the same source, 1.5% of households have income over $250,000.  If they are all two earner married couple families, then roughly 6% of households are two earner married couple families with incomes over $250,000 per year.</p>
<p>Non family households typically contain two or more families and, in fact, there are more families than households.  I won&#8217;t bother to look it up, but 6% is being very generous to those who claim that families with incomes over $250,000 per year are not all that rich by US standards.</p>
<p>According to<a href="http://tinyurl.com/3xpexk6"> this study</a> (the first I found) the highest bicoastal local price indices are about 1.3 times the national average.  </p>
<p>The highest price index was for Honalulu, which I will ignore as it is not on the West or East coasts.</p>
<p>2.67% of households had income over 200,000 in 2005.  250/1.3  <br />Being insanely generous and assuming that all households with income over 250,000 live in the very costliest areas, and that they are all two earner married couple families, and that there are no more families than households, I get to a two earner married couple family with income of $ 250,000 is only richer than 86% of two earner married couple families given the correction for the local price level.</p>
<p>This is very very far from the average Joe married to the average Jane and both working.</p>
<p>There is no way that any numerate person who is willing to google for 10 minutes can believe that a family with income over 250,000 per year is not rich by US standards.  All of the corrections are already considered when getting from an income most people consider rich up to $250,000 per year.</p>

<p>Jeff Sachs proposed higher taxes on the rich.<br />Felix Salmon <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2010/06/08/how-to-solve-the-fiscal-dilemma/">wrote</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t think this is possible, politically, in either the US or the UK. In the US, the middle classes are implacably opposed to tax hikes on people making more money than they themselves will ever make.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin Drum agrees with Salmon about US public opinion and asks.</p>
<p><a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2010/06/taxes-and-rich">&#8220;Why are Americans so unsympathetic to higher taxes on zillionaires?&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The answer is that Americans are sympathetic to higher taxes on the rich, as has been demonstrated by every poll on the question in the past two decades. </p>
<p>Matt Yglesias noted one recent poll which shows majority support for higher taxes on the rich.  I just add that I know of no poll in US history which doesn’t show majority support for higher taxes on the rich.</p>
<p>Somehow this absolutely striking, dramatic, undeniable feature of US public opinion has been overlooked.  I think the reason is that policy makers and pundits agree that soaking the rich is un-American, and the fact that most citizens disagree must therefore not be conceded.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In the elite debate it is definitely agreed that Americans hate class warfare and are not willing to soak the rich.   I firmly believe that this is agreed, because it serves the group interest of the elite.    I don’t think Drum, Salmon or many others are influenced by their personal self interest (Drum and Salmon clearly wish things were as they really are).   I think the fact that the US public want to raise taxes on the rich isn’t transmitted from pundit to pundit the way the alleged fact that Americans want Obama to show more anger at BP is transmitted, because critical links are broken by people who just hate the fact and won’t accept it.</p>
<p>I add that admitting that Marx had a point makes me feel ill.</p>
<p>Kevin Drum and Felix Salmon ignore not only massive evidence but also my <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/08/most-americans-want-to-soak-rich.html">many</a> <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2010/04/firedoglake-what-am-i-to-think-of.html">posts</a> <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2005/02/check-this-out-over-at-pollingreport.html">pointing</a> <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2010/02/whats-wrong-with-michael-kinsley-in.html">to</a> <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2010/03/what-is-to-be-done-kevin-drum-predicts.html">that</a> <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2007/05/john-at-ezras-place-writes-writes-if-he.html">massive</a> <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2005/02/wobegone-bush-this-poll-just-made-my.html">evidence</a>.  My feelings are hurt.  Not to boast, but just to boast, I have actually corresponded by e-mail with Drum and by some kind of instant messenger with Salmon.   </p>
<p>As I mentioned before the jump, Matthew Yglesias pointed out that their perception of public opinion is totally inconsistent with public opinion.  Here’s <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2010/06/the-public-and-taxing-the-rich.php">the link </a>again. The very best fact is that 64 % of polled American adults with annual household income over $250,000 think that “raising income taxes on households making more than $250,000 should … be a main part of any government approach to the deficit”*.  </p>
<p>Drum and Salmon’s amazing disconnect from reality is not based on the inflation of the concept of “middle class” which now seems to mean “upper class but not super rich” and goes from the 50th percentile up to the 99th or something.  By that definition,  most middle class respondents agree with rich respondents that taxes on the rich should be increased (perhaps conditional on there being spending cuts and other tax increases).</p>
<p>*In plain numbers this would seem to be 16 out of 25 rich respondents favor increasing their own taxes.  That gives a standard error of the estimate of 9.6% so the two standard deviations interval would be from 44.8 % to 83.2%.  This calculation makes no sense with such a tiny sample.  The null that 50% or less of the rich support higher taxes on the rich is not rejected at the 5% level, p = 8%.  The null that 40% or fewer of the rich support higher taxes on the rich is rejected at the 5% level the p level for the null of 45% is almost exactly 5%.</p>
<p>The rich want to soak the rich.</p>
