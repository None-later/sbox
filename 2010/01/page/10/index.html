                                <p><a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/pete-davis/1364/what-did-we-learn-2009" target="_blank">Pete Davis</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson initially sold Congress in the fall of 2008 on emergency intervention to purchase “toxic assets,” but quickly reversed course in favor of direct capital injections. Those <em>favored</em> financial institutions revived more quickly than most thought possible and most of those injections have already been paid back. <em>However, most of the toxic assets remain on bank balance sheets, impeding new lending. </em>[emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>At the end of the last post, I was ready to discuss “deadweight loss.” But a brief detour seems in order.</p>
<p>We used to talk a lot at this blog about DSGE models. Economists talk a lot about Equilibrium, even if they don’t fully understand it. At its core, saying “equilibrium” is saying “this is the best of all possible worlds.”  You can’t improve on equilibrium unless you choose a non-Pareto-optimal solution (i.e., a solution in which at least one person is affected negatively).</p>
<p>Equilibrium doesn’t mean you have achieved ideal social welfare. (Anyone who has looked at Game Theory for more than a minute can tell you that.)  But it does mean that things are “hitting on all cylinders.”  Or, more accurately, if the economy is <strong>not</strong> at equilibrium, the odds are better that people making choices will make mistakes.</p>
<p>Which is why I pointed to <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2010/01/1983-ponzi-game-prediction.html" target="_blank">Brenda Rosser</a> and especially this<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The way out of this thing is a shift in the way we treat the LDC debt,&#8221; Coldwell argued. &#8220;The banks would have to take a big hit on their balance sheets, but then it&#8217;s over. If you give them a definitive hit, then they could say it&#8217;s behind us. If you get down to a crisis stage, the banks would accept that. They would have no choice.” &#8212; William Greider. &#8216;The Secrets of the Temple &#8211; How the Federal Reserve Runs the Country&#8217; Touchstone 1989. Page 549</p></blockquote>
<p>If the banks take that hit, we’re back at equilibrium.  If they don’t, they continue to make suboptimal choices.  Which brings us back to the graphic.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Sz_3sgW14fI/AAAAAAAAAW8/dqY9ItVe21k/s1600-h/NonPerfLoansQtrly.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Sz_3sgW14fI/AAAAAAAAAW8/dqY9ItVe21k/s400/NonPerfLoansQtrly.JPG"></a></p>
<p>There were several good suggestions for refinement in the comments, none of which can I do at the moment, since I’m working solely from FRED data. (General response: those acquisitions, especially WaMu, were made on terms that were agreeable to all acquiring parties. Which doesn’t mean those acquisitions may not be affecting the flow, but it’s likely more a question of acceleration than velocity, especially given the relative sizes of the institutions.)</p>
<p>But the FRED data is damning enough.  The risk management procedures at larger institutions were significantly worse than they were at smaller ones.  And the bigger they are, the worse they are becoming:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S0H8o5ZOg_I/AAAAAAAAAXE/Y14aM6VSJWg/s1600-h/NPLLargeBanks.JPG"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S0H8o5ZOg_I/AAAAAAAAAXE/Y14aM6VSJWg/s400/NPLLargeBanks.JPG"></a></p>
<p>With several waves of doubt still to come, we are (choose one) (a) far from equilibrium or (b) still making suboptimal choices.</p>
<p>So let’s do a finger exercise.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Mortgages Outstanding approx. $11 trillion (Q4 2008)</p>
<p>Amount at risk (SWAG)25%</p>
<p>Expected Losses $2.75T</p>
<p>Fed Holdings (<a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2009/12/term_deposit_fa.html" target="_blank">TARP, TALF, CPLF, etc.</a>) approx. $2.2 T</p>
<p>Remaining Balance Sheet Exposuren approx. $550B</p>
<p>25% at risk seems about right.  Slightly over 10% of that $11T was Home Equity Loans, and the outstanding household debt at that time was <a href="http://mwhodges.home.att.net/nat-debt/debt-nat-a.htm#household" target="_blank">about 123% of national income</a> while <a href="http://mwhodges.home.att.net/family_a.htm#home_equity" target="_blank">equity was around 40%</a>.</p>
<p>But note that this assumes that all of the special facilities remain in place. For instance, per Hamilton’s graphic, the Fed now owns about $1T worth of MBSes. CR notes that this program “<a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/01/pimcos-mcculley-three-major-issues-for.html" target="_blank">is scheduled to be complete by the end of Q1</a>.”</p>
<p>Of course, there are some cures that would be worse than the disease.  Via alea’s Twitter feed, I see that either the headline writer or the speaker <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0320287220100103" target="_blank">made a slip yesterday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;There ought to be government-backed ABS,&#8221; said Fed economist Wayne Passmore in a presentation to the American Economic Association.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that the quote is not (just) MBS but <strong>A</strong>BS—<em>asset</em>-backed securities, including credit-card receivables, car loans, basically any form of consumer (or other) debt that can be securitized.  The result of this would be that your tax dollars would pay a bank for your default on a credit card that charged you 30% interest, despite the risk-free rate being something near 0%—and almost always in the 5-8% range.</p>
<p>The reason we like equilibrium is that people who make mistakes do so because they are “being irrational.” When we’re not at equilibrium, we realize that they make irrational decisions all the time.  In what I hope will be the last of this series, we’ll look at irrational and rational decisions—and why irrationality may be the best survival strategy.</p>

                                <p>So far the topical open threads have gathered great material. As Bruce mentioned and hoped, the partisan nature that accompanied certain posts was muted when readers could offer a  look at topics such as trade and entitlements without the intervening point of view of a particular post.</p>
<p>Angry Bear will always offer attitude and links, but I for one found the format informative and I think will continue the conversation.</p>
<p>To avoid any confusion I will label &#8216;open threads&#8217; as such for any subject, and use the term &#8216;topical threads&#8217; by providing a subject title as in the last two.  We don&#8217;t have the option of offering forums except through google groups, but this move to informed conversation appeals to me and suffices for now.  </p>
<p>Unless of course someone offers an alternative&#8230;</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This is a follow up to an article I wrote earlier this week, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/12/older-workers-working-longer-labor.html">Older workers working longer; labor-force participation falling</a>. In response to the article, which highlights the BLS employment and labor-force participation projections for 2008-2018, 2slugbaits (a loyal AB commenter) presented the following point:<br />
<blockquote>The 2 industry sectors expected to have the largest employment growth are professional and business services (4.2 million) and health care and social assistance (4.0 million).</p>
<p>Put another way, employment growth will be in nontradeable goods sectors, which suggests we might have to sell a lot of assets in order to pay for imports.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is the government actually forecasting that Japan an China will finance the U.S. trade deficit for the next ten years? I assumed (silly of me) that any government (BLS) projection would be based on such international pledges as the <a href="http://www.treas.gov/initiatives/us-china/">U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue</a>:<br />
<blockquote>To this end, both countries [U.S. and China] will enhance communication and the exchange of information regarding macro-economic policy, and will work together to pursue policies of adjusting domestic demand and relative prices to lead to more sustainable and balanced trade and growth.</p>
<p>&#8230;and more specifically&#8230;</p>
<p>The United States will take measures to increase national saving as a share of GDP.  The U.S. household saving rate has already risen sharply as a result of the crisis, contributing to a significant decline in the U.S. current account deficit, and the United States will adopt policies that will continue to encourage household saving.</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. commitment: grow national saving as a share of GDP and significantly reduce the current account deficit. According to the BLS long-term forecast, the U.S. will make good on just one the these two pledges.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The table below extracts national saving and the current account from the BLS 2018 economic assumptions for the employment projections (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_403.htm">Table 4.3</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0HPzfrdNaI/AAAAAAAACvc/8plRHqFU5sA/s1600-h/CA_table.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0HPzfrdNaI/AAAAAAAACvc/8plRHqFU5sA/s400/CA_table.png" alt="" border="0"></a>Note: two identities are needed: (1) National Saving is Income minus Consumption minus Government Spending, and (2) the Current Account is National Saving minus Investment. The BLS projects GDP rather than GNP = GDP + net receipts from the rest of the world. In using GDP as the definition of &#8220;income&#8221;, net receipts from the rest of the world is zero, and the current account reduces to net-exports.</p>
<p>To be sure, the BLS does forecast that U.S. national saving rate will rise 67.5%, from 9.3% of GDP in 2008 to 10.2% in 2018. But domestic investment rises by more, +72.1%. Therefore, the current account deficit grows by 81.3%.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not seeing any healthy reduction of the current account deficit by 2018. 2slugs is right: the BLS is essentially forecasting that China and Japan (among other perpetual savers) will finance a growing U.S. trade deficit. Oh man.</p>

                                <p>UPDATE: CR appears to agree with me, even as <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2010/01/what-bernanke-didnt-say.html">he raises another point</a>:<br />
<blockquote> Bernanke used data from other countries to suggest monetary policy was not a huge contributor to the bubble &#8230; however, Bernanke didn&#8217;t discuss if non-traditional mortgage products contributed to housing bubbles in other countries. This would seem like a key missing part of the speech.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m willing to believe that my interpretation of <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100103a.htm">this speech</a> is inaccurate, but here&#8217;s the evidence:<br />
<blockquote>Some observers have assigned monetary policy a central role in the crisis. Specifically, they claim that excessively easy monetary policy by the Federal Reserve in the first half of the decade helped cause a bubble in house prices in the United States, a bubble whose inevitable collapse proved a major source of the financial and economic stresses of the past two years. Proponents of this view typically argue for a substantially greater role for monetary policy in preventing and controlling bubbles in the prices of housing and other assets. In contrast, others have taken the position that policy was appropriate for the macroeconomic conditions that prevailed, and that it was neither a principal cause of the housing bubble nor the right tool for controlling the increase in house prices. Obviously, in light of the economic damage inflicted by the collapses of two asset price bubbles over the past decade, a great deal more than historical accuracy rides on the resolution of this debate.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I have to pick, I&#8217;ll take the latter group.  Easy money alone doesn&#8217;t cause a crisis. So when he says:<br />
<blockquote> Can accommodative monetary policies during this period reasonably account for the magnitude of the increase in house prices that we observed? If not, what does account for it?</p></blockquote>
<p>The first answer is clearly &#8220;No.&#8221; And the second answer is important.  Eventually, he answers it:<br />
<blockquote>I noted earlier that the most important source of lower initial monthly payments, which allowed more people to enter the housing market and bid for properties, was not the general level of short-term interest rates, but the increasing use of more exotic types of mortgages and the associated decline of underwriting standards. That conclusion suggests that the best response to the housing bubble would have been regulatory, not monetary. Stronger regulation and supervision aimed at problems with underwriting practices and lenders&#8217; risk management would have been a more effective and surgical approach to constraining the housing bubble than a general increase in interest rates. Moreover, regulators, supervisors, and the private sector could have more effectively addressed building risk concentrations and inadequate risk-management practices without necessarily having had to make a judgment about the sustainability of house price increases.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve and other agencies did make efforts to address poor mortgage underwriting practices. In 2005, we worked with other banking regulators to develop guidance for banks on nontraditional mortgages, notably interest-only and option-ARM products. In March 2007, we issued interagency guidance on subprime lending, which was finalized in June. After a series of hearings that began in June 2006, we used authority granted us under the Truth in Lending Act to issue rules that apply to all high-cost mortgage lenders, not just banks. However, these efforts came too late or were insufficient to stop the decline in underwriting standards and effectively constrain the housing bubble. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>As Albert Brooks once noted, he &#8220;buried the lede.&#8221; Bernanke notes that the &#8220;nontraditional&#8221; products constituted around 1/3 of the market by 2003. (As many others have noted, those mortgages were not passed through/to FHA/Fannie/Freddie, either.)  Two years later, guidelines were being developed.</p>
<p>An institution that did not attempt to regulate claiming that it should be given more regulatory power is an invitation to disaster.  Or am I missing something?</p>

<p>A quote from Amartya Sen, and my New Year&#8217;s Tax Resolutions (for Congress and the Obama Administration)</p>
<p>The time between December 30 and January 4 seems to be filled with lists.  Along with the ever-present list of &#8220;to dos&#8221; that haven&#8217;t been done and still are hanging around waiting for our attention, there are everyone&#8217;s &#8220;10 best&#8221; lists (e.g., the ten best movies&#8211;regretably, I don&#8217;t think I saw ten new movies in 2009, so can only say I thought Slumdog was a decent showing) or their opposite (e.g., the ten worst celebrities of the year, every one of them with Tiger Woods and Gov. Sanford firmly placed near the top).  And of course there are those New Year&#8217;s resolutions that we are supposed to deliberate over and then deliver on when the New Year rolls around&#8211;mine is to join my hubby in his morning walk and to give up doughnuts completely.</p>
<p>Not being one to gather quotes all year just for this final celebration, here&#8217;s one quote that I believe is worth thinking about as we head into the new year.  Amartya Sen writes, in &#8220;The Idea of Justice&#8221; (Belknap Press 2009), at 32:</p>
<blockquote><p>Being smarter may help the understanding not only of one&#8217;s self-interest, but also how the lives of others can be strongly affected by one&#8217;s own actions.  Proponents of so-called &#8216;Rational Choice Theory&#8217; (first proposed in economics and then enthusiastically adopted by a number of political and legal thinkers) have tried hard to make us accept the peculiar understanding that rational choice consists only in clever promotion of self-interest (which is how, oddly enough, &#8216;rational choice&#8217; is defined by the proponents of brand-named &#8216;rational choice theory&#8217;).  Nevertheless, our heads have not all been colonized by that remarkably alienating belief.  There is considerable resistance to the idea that it must be patently irrational&#8211;and stupid&#8211;to try to do anything for others except to the extent that doing good to others would enhance one&#8217;s own well-being.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />In light of Sen&#8217;s helpful clarity about the ridiculousness of &#8216;rational choice theory&#8217;, I also offer the following as the resolutions that I wish Congress and the Obama administration (and/or various administrative agencies thereof) would make (and follow through on) for this new year of 2010.</p>
<blockquote><p>1) The Treasury should resolve that it will no longer provide special dispensation to the financial institution powers that be, such as its invalid notice indicating that it would not enforce the law on loss corporations for too-big-to-fail banks, thus allowing too-big-to-fail banks to become even bigger by buying loss banks, and then allowing them to use those losses in direct contravention of the law and avoid paying income tax for years (or perhaps decades).  A similar &#8220;notice&#8221; went out recently&#8211;Notice 2010-12&#8211;stating that Treasury will continue to fail to enforce the rules under section 956 regarding what constitutes an obligation and hence relieving US shareholders of controlled foreign corporations ( many of them possibly the same too-big-to-fail banks) of further US taxpaying obligations.  (This notice continued the nonenforcement decision Treasury had made in 2008, in Notice 2008-91.  Too bad decisions do not make a good decision.)</p>
<p>2) The Supreme Court should resolve to deal with the problem of financial institutions claiming patent protection for all kinds of financial software and financial engineering &#8220;solutions&#8221; and for others claiming patent protection for tax planning strategies by releasing a decision in the Bilski case that clarifies the &#8220;abstract idea&#8221; exception.  The Court should say that no patent can be granted for innovations that merely utilize the positive laws to assert that a transaction carried out in a particular way will have a particular legal result, or for other methods of conducting transactions or of organizing human activity that do not involve the technological arts, as understood under European patent law.</p>
<p>3)  Congress should resolve to end the preferential treatment of those few Americans who own most of the financial assets of the country by ending the capital gains preference.</p>
<p>4) Congress should resolve to eliminate the preferential tax treatment of the earned income of hedge fund and equity fund managers (the so-called &#8220;carried interest&#8221;), and any other &#8220;partners&#8221; that manage partnerships and earn a share of the partnership&#8217;s gains as their compensation (such as real estate partnerships).</p>
<p>5) In order to restore some sort of balance between worker and employer, Congress should eliminate the business deduction for any compensation in excess of 20 times the average salary (about $1 million).  The cap on compensation deduction to apply to compensation in any form (stock, assets, cash), whether or not &#8220;performance related&#8221;.  </p>
<p>6) In order to treat the gifts of ordinary Americans to charities of their choice the same as the gifts of multi-millionaires to charities of their choice, Congress should repeal the special rule that permits a charitable contribution deduction for the value of stocks rather than the investment basis in the stocks.  Will that limit contributions that are made?  Perhaps, though it is clear that contributors do so for many reasons and not merely for the contribution deduction.   </p>
<p>7) Congress should resolve to resolve the estate tax situation once and for all, before some do-nothing heir-to-be decides that 2010 is the right time for the wealthy person in his life to go.  Congress should enact a modest exemption of $2 million but should make the estate tax rates progressive (beginning at2009s 45%, but moving up to at least 65% for the largest estates). </p>
<p>8) Congress should resolve to revisit the tax brackets.  We have an economy in which the average income is around $50,000, but there are individuals who make more than $500 million a year.  That spread is so large that it cannot be adequately addressed by brackets that focuse on the first $350,000 or so.  Those who make $200 million a year have incredibly more freedom of choice, and the few dollars they pay in taxes are merely peanuts compared to the precious funds from an average family.  We need to make the income tax more progressive by adding additional rate brackets&#8211;perhaps as many as 3 or 4 more.  That would still be a far cry from the income tax system before Reagan took office, when we had top rates more than double today&#8217;s top rates.  But it would address the dire fiscal need of the country in a way that is doable without creating undue suffering.</p>
<p>9) Congress and Treasury should resolve to clean up the partnership tax rules so that they do not offer such extraordinary flexibility to partners to arrange their affairs to avoid taxation&#8211;for example, by eliminating the electivity permitted to partners in many places in the rules (make the remedial method the only method allowed for taking into account book-tax disparities in contributed property) and by changing the way that partners take account of partnership debt (such as being able to get distributions of nonrecourse debt that monetize partnership property appreciation). </p>
<p>10) Congress should re-visit the rules on mergers and acquisitions, so that a tax-free merger becomes an unusual event.  Part of the problem we are facing today is that multinational corporations have grown so big that they wield enormous power globally and can sometimes appear to be able to order laws to suit them.  Witness the fact that we are well beyond the beginnings of the financial system crisis, and no single piece of legislation imposing new and better regulations on the banks have been enacted.  The size of corporations ensures that they will become as focused on raising rents for their managers as they will on making profits for shareholders, and that they will care not one whit for the ordinary American who is their customer, or their low-wage employee, or the resident of a town that they leave derelict when they move to sunnier shores.  We say that the rationale for tax-free reorganization provisions is to encourage efficient organization of corporations.  But efficiency is not God, and in fact focus on efficiency may leave democracy and fairness far behind.  We should give tax-free treatment only to shareholders who get no boot for any of their stock, and only in transactions where a high percentage of the consideration is stock (perhaps 80% or more). </p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I gave a guest lecture in Intermediate Macro last year.  Normally, I try not to do such things, but I was staring at some data and the offer came at the same time the data started making sense, so I said yes.</p>
<p>I gave them a presentation on the similarities and differences between Economics and Finance. How Economics is the Best of All Possible Worlds while Finance never is; how tax and regulatory arbitrage drives structures and products; how transaction costs are never minor; how intermediation drives investment in specific areas of finance in ways that don&#8217;t really get dealt with in Economics.*</p>
<p>One of the things we know in Economics is that there are not $20 bills on the street. (Ted Gayer of the Brookings Institute made <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/1230_negative_costs_gayer.aspx">this argument</a> twice recently.  If this were true, &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_mover_advantage">first mover advantage</a>&#8221; would also have to be nonexistent.)</p>
<p>Investment managers talk about finding $20 on the street all of the time. Most of the time, they can prove this.</p>
<p>Sometimes, they can&#8217;t.  If you invest in a retirement fund of any sort, <a href="http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2010/01/dark-privatised-social-security-story.html">this</a> is the one post you should read for the new year.  Especially for this:<br />
<blockquote> However there is a way of proving that a fund is not a Ponzi – and that is to “show us the money”.  If the assets are really there then it should be possible to convince regulators of that fact by showing them the assets.  If Bernie Madoff had been asked to prove the existence of all the money he supposedly managed then he would have been caught because he could not comply.  An honest fund should be able to comply fairly quickly – sometimes within 20 minutes – but almost certainly within a week.</p></blockquote>
<p>and this<br />
<blockquote>I have heard lots of criticism of the Australian Securities regulator.  However on this important matter their actions were exemplary.  They did what the SEC could not do and act on a “Markopolos letter” within weeks.  They did what the SEC should have done when they investigated Madoff – and attempted to confirm the existence and value of the assets.</p>
<p>Three weeks later ASIC put a stop on all Astarra funds – prohibiting new money going in or any moneys going out.  They acted to protect investors.  This showed responsiveness that Mary Schapiro and American regulators can only aspire too.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is one of the reasons we pay transaction costs. That &#8220;SEC fee&#8221; when you sell shares of a stock are intended to ensure that the market remains &#8220;rational.&#8221;  Which is why the greatest evil of economic modeling, imnvho, is that it often treats the very things that might make its premises viable as irrelevant to its model.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve made it already, and it&#8217;s one I can &#8212; and will &#8212; keep.</p>
<p>by Noni Mausa</p>
<p>For me, salmon and tuna have always been at opposite ends of my food spectrum &#8212; cheap staple versus delicacy.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a boomer, and I am sure I&#8217;m not alone in having a mother who used tuna as a tasty way to feed seven or more of us on a budget.  Make a cream sauce, open 3 cans of tuna and a tin of green peas, and pour it over toast &#8212; that was the comfort food of my childhood and adulthood too.</p>
<p>And heaped up tuna sandwiches with mayonnaise and little chopped gherkins &#8230; pasta salad with cheese, peas and more gherkins &#8230; tuna casserole with onion rings on top &#8230;  well, you can tell I <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Minnesotan-Visitors-Guide/dp/0140092846">grew up in Minnesota</a>.  </p>
<p>I miss them already, and it&#8217;s only been a few weeks.</p>
<p>At my parent&#8217;s table tuna was the rule, not the exception.  We must have eaten a school of tunas in my school years.  Oh, tinned salmon showed up now and then also, but I never got to know the delights of broiled salmon till I grew up.</p>
<p>But this autumn I decided I couldn&#8217;t have either of them anymore.</p>
<p>Eating a tuna isn&#8217;t like eating a cow.  Cows are grazing animals, but tuna, silvery streamlined and one of the fastest fish in the sea, is a peak predator.  Eating tuna is like eating cheetahs &#8212; yummy, endangered carnivores, in cream sauce.</p>
<p>At the other end of my delicacy spectrum we have the beautiful wild ocean relative of the trout, the salmon.  The wild ones, as are tuna, are endangered.</p>
<p>But I can&#8217;t eat the farmed salmon either &#8212; it&#8217;s now certain they act as a reservoir for disease and parasites for the wild ones, and there are other problems too numerous to detail here.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MSuZ1riS9qU/Sz02jjBl3II/AAAAAAAAAYQ/1TcI5bDjJzc/s1600-h/fish+tins.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MSuZ1riS9qU/Sz02jjBl3II/AAAAAAAAAYQ/1TcI5bDjJzc/s320/fish+tins.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>So earlier this autumn I had my last tin of tuna (creamed with a sprinkle of curry powder &#8211; very un-Minnesotan) and my last tin of salmon (can&#8217;t remember what I did with that.)  There is a single salmon steak still in the freezer.  Then that&#8217;s it.  Those last two tins hang from my cedar tree now, clinking gently in the wind, to remind me.  But so far I haven&#8217;t been tempted at all.</p>
<p>Maybe someone else will eat the last tuna, or the last salmon.  But it won&#8217;t be me.</p>
