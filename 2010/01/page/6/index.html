                                <p>The flak started quickly. Rusty suggested taking Red Cross training and being part of the solution—the very solution that can&#8217;t reach the country.  kharris compared me (un?)favorably to The Drudge Report for saying (after Robert Gates did) that the delivery obstruction was &#8220;deliberate.&#8221;</p>
<p>The problem is the evidence keeps mounting—and it&#8217;s all on my side. <a href="http://www.buenosairesherald.com/BreakingNews/View/22873">Exhibit One</a>:<br />
<blockquote>US forces last week turned back a French aid plane carrying a field hospital from the damaged, congested airport in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, prompting a complaint from French Cooperation Minister Alain Joyandet. The plane landed safely the following day.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/us/19refugee.html?ref=americas&#038;pagewanted=print">Exhibit Two</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The State Department has also been denying many seriously injured people in Port-au-Prince visas to be transferred to Miami for surgery and treatment, said Dr. William O’Neill, the dean of the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami, which has erected a field hospital near the airport there.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s beyond insane,&#8221; Dr. O’Neill said Saturday, having just returned to Miami from Haiti. &#8220;It’s bureaucracy at its worse.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/19/world/americas/19aid.html?ref=americas&#038;pagewanted=print">Exhibit Three</a> (wrong people doing distribution):<br />
<blockquote>When the aid helicopters descend on the Pétionville Club golf course, once a playground for the wealthy and now a sprawling city of makeshift tents, the residents hurry toward them. But to get there, they must climb a steep embankment to a landing zone on top of a hill where the 82nd Airborne Division distributes the food and water&#8230;.</p>
<p>The elderly get priority, but some of them cannot make it up. Families with young children also have priority, so some people are said to have borrowed babies and hauled them up the hill&#8230;.</p>
<p>Since members of the 82nd Airborne, from Fort Bragg, N.C., began distributing food on Saturday, their delivery method has evolved.</p>
<p>On the first day they wore rifles slung around their backs. By Monday, they had ditched the rifles and were trying to present themselves more as aid workers than as soldiers. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the job usually done by the Red Cross (or that was done the first few days in New Orleans by the SCA, who had the advantage of knowing how to move a large amount of supplies through mud and floods), and who know the issues involved in distribution.  This is the job those $10 contributions by texting are supposed to be supporting.</p>
<p>This is the job that isn&#8217;t being done for nonexistent &#8220;security&#8221; issues.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>There is a light snow at the moment.  While the snow and icy roads are cleared here from yesterday, we shall see what kind of weather unfolds throughout the day.</p>
<p>The phone has been ringing steadily over the week end and Monday, with volunteer or robo calls from both senate candidates Martha Coakley and Scott Brown.  Sometimes the political ads during the day ran consecutively from different funding sources. The ceremonies for Martin Luther King took a backstage on this holiday. </p>
<p>There appears to be a lot of attempts at figuring out what is going on concerning the meteoric rise in the polls of Mr. Brown.  I assume most readers have a bit of background on this race, so I will not offer that here.  Of course, without the super-majority bar being pushed and accepted in the US Senate and a contentiously fought health insurance bill, this race would have less national coverage.</p>
<p>One needs to remember Massachusetts (is that spelled correctly? I spell it MA) has an electoral mind of its own.  It has 51% registered independents out of the pool of registered voters.  Even though there are three times the number of registered Democrats than registered Republicans (roughly 36% to 12%) we have had a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Republican govenor</a> for 16 years since William Weld took the position in 1991.</p>
<p>The state legislative bodies are overwhelmingly Democratic. </p>
<p>The 1972 national election saw MA being the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&#038;year=1972">only state going for George McGovern</a>, DC not being a state. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&#038;year=1980">1980 national election</a> had MA split the vote 41.90% Reagan to 41.75% Carter, over 15% going to the Independent.</p>
<p>Whether this special election is a bellwether for a national trend or just a reflection of MA voter quirkiness and bad timing for any election to reflect a trend in overall voter sentiment (low turnout might make it more of a comment on political machine effectiveness and preparedness) is not something I feel comfortable expounding on from a knowlegeable perspective.  </p>
<p>I am going out to vote, and await results and implications.  So this is a topical thread I believe.</p>
<p>Update:  <a target="_ blank" href="http://www.truthout.org/massachusetts-election-live-blog56173">Heavy turnout at the polls</a></p>
<p>Update 2:  Martha Coakley concedes 9:24 tonight.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://al-zorra.livejournal.com/">Constance</a>, I see that the donations are pouring in. <a href="http://www.msf.org/">Medecins sans Frontieres (Doctors without Borders)</a>, <a href="http://www.pih.org/">Partners in Health</a>, even the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/">American Red Cross</a>.</p>
<p>There is supply.  And there is clearly demand.  But <a href="http://pacificfreepress.com/news/1/5407-where-is-haitis-aid-going.html">it appears that delivery is being deliberately impeded</a>:<br />
<blockquote>As life-saving medical supplies, food, water purification chemicals and vehicles pile up at the airport in Port-au-Prince, and as news networks report a massive international effort to deliver emergency aid, the people in the shattered city are wondering when they will see help&#8230;.</p>
<p>BBC reporter Andy Gallagher told an 8 pm (Pacific Time) broadcast tonight that he had traveled &#8220;extensively&#8221; in Port-au-Prince during the day and saw little sign of aid delivery. He said he was shown nothing but courtesy by the Haitians he encountered. Everywhere he went he was taken by residents to see what had happened to their neighbourhood, their homes and their lives. Then they asked, &#8220;Where is the help?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When the Rescue teams arrive,&#8221; Gallagher said, &#8220;they will be welcomed with open arms.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates&#8230;was asked by media in Washington why relief supplies were not being delivered by air. He answered, &#8220;It seems to me that air drops will simply lead to riots.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gates says that &#8220;security&#8221; concerns are impeding the delivery of aid. But Gallagher responded directly to that in his report, saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m not experiencing that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Describing the airport, Gallagher reported, &#8220;There are plenty of materials on the ground and plenty of people there. I don&#8217;t know what the problem is with delivery.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The longer the wait, the more likely the prophecy becomes self-fulfilling.  Which still does not make it true. And, in this case, there is no Superdome to store people in.</p>

<p>Too much wealth? more dialogue on the issue</p>
<p>Several days ago, Jim Maule ran a post on the disproportionate number of wealthy Congress members&#8211;44% are millionaires, compared to about 1% of the population at large.  <a target="_blank" href="http://mauledagain.blogspot.com/#475259359161946068">A Tax Policy Determination Clue</a> (Jan. 6, 2010).  I picked that post up in the context of noting a number of links addressing the issue of wealth&#8211;what is rich, <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/01/whos-rich-whats-going-on-with-those-freshwater-economists-and-more-posts-worth-reading.html">who&#8217;s rich</a> (Jan. 7, 2010), and what are we doing about it.  </p>
<p>One of my frequent readers, Peter Pappas, didn&#8217;t much like my comment that such disproportionate wealth in Congress was ultimately &#8220;bad news for ordinary Americans.&#8221;  He didn&#8217;t comment on my blog or email me (as he sometimes has) but instead wrote a scathing critque on his own blog, in which he (i) accused me of hating the wealthy (using &#8220;evil rich&#8221; to categorize the topics of two posts I noted as worth reading, whereas anyone who has read much of my writing knows that I neither think the rich are evil nor think that the rich should get a pass on paying their fair share just because they have lots of capital), (ii) missed the point entirely of my fellow <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/01/rich-are-different.html">Angry Bear Tom Bozzo&#8217;s post</a> , which suggested it worth noting &#8211;in considering what makes someone &#8220;rich&#8221;&#8211; that there are some who live off of capital income from financial assets and that salary as a percentage of income goes down precipitously as capital income goes up precipitously, which creates a significant cut off point in determining who is &#8220;rich&#8221; at the intersection of the two rapidly changing lines, and (iii) (after throwing around a few labels like &#8220;left wing&#8221; and &#8220;strawman argument&#8221;) proceeded to make the unsupported blanket and absolute assertion that &#8220;American millionaires &#8230; know what it&#8217;s like to struggle [because] their &#8216;unordinariness&#8217; is less a byproduct of their wealth than it is a byproduct of the fact that, through diligent study, hard work and intelligence, they have managed to lift themselves out of the ranks of the ordinary and mediocre.&#8221;   This is followed by another assertion later on&#8211;&#8220;why is it difficult for left wingers to acknowledge that wealthy people got that way through perseverance, hard work and sacrifice?&#8221;    <a target="_blank" href="http://blog.pappastax.com/index.php/2010/01/08/two-professors-an-angry-bear-and-hate-the-rich-syndrome/">See Two Professors, an Angry Bear, and Hate the Rich Syndrome</a>, Jan 8, 2010.  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Huh?   What about inherited millions?  What about the lessening mobility between the ranks of ordinary (middle class) and the wealthy?  What about the way the extraordinarily wealthy have outdistanced even the relatively wealthy?  What about the fact that CEOs now average about 400-500 times the annual incomes of typical workers in their firms, whereas 40 years ago it was around 20 times?  Did this concentration of wealth come about through &#8220;hard work, perseverance and sacrifice&#8221; or is much of it owed to the wealth of the prior generation and the ability of someone born into relative ease to make even more (with an elite college education, important contacts, and all the other appurtenances of wealth to boost the value of the money), as Maule also asks (see link below)?  Aren&#8217;t there studies showing that most people who actually move up in the ranks of the upper class started out there to begin with&#8211;that a person whose father is decently well off has a much better chance of moving up than a person whose father is not?  Except for the odd lottery or casino bet that pays off, there just aren&#8217;t many opportunities for an underprivileged kid from a low-income ghetto to even get a college education, much less move up the ladder of success, for all we like to claim we are more mobile than other societies.  Getting started in a business?  Takes someone to fund your startup costs&#8211;family and friends that are already middle class or already upper class must provide a great boost, don&#8217;t ya think?  </p>
<p>Even those who do make it to millions may well have engaged in the &#8220;selfishness and greed&#8221; that Pappas says we &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t whine&#8230;about&#8221;.  Well, I beg to differ.  Admittedly, not every millionaire got there through selfishness and greed, but clearly much of the way wealth is accumulated is through greedy policies (firing workers, rather than reducing dividends to owners and salaries to upper class managers; moving from one locale to another to exploit a pool of needier workers; breaking unions to be able to offer even less in benefits, polluting rather than undertaking environmentally sound measures, etc.).  To the extent that wealth is acquired by exploiting the poor, the naive, and the gullible or by polluting the world we live in or by taking subsidies from communities and then leaving them holding the (empty) bag, there is something wrong and we should point it out, perhaps even adopt tax and other policies that make it much more difficult for those with power to exploit those who do not have power (such as steeply progressive tax rates, more substantial estate taxation, higher taxes on polluters, facilitating unionization to give employees some power to push back against the greed of millionaire CEOs and owners, etc.).  </p>
<p>The fact is, everybody can&#8217;t be millionaires in this country, and the fact that someone is or isn&#8217;t a millionaire has very little to do with whether that person has worked hard, shown perseverance and sacrificed.  Pappas&#8217; &#8220;rant&#8221; (his own term) in defense of the rich seems very ill-considered.  We should be thinking about how to create a good standard of living for all, rather than defending the egregious examples of wealth accumulation that make it ever harder to sustain democratic institutions that can work for the benefit of all rather than the benefit of the powerful few.  That is why I have chosen as the theme of this blog &#8220;democratic egalitarianism&#8221;&#8211;a philosophy that encourages policies that are directed towards sustaining democratic institutions and that recognizes that every policy will be redistributionist though many redistribute upwards (from middle class workers fired to managers and owners with higher capital gains that are preferentially taxed) rather than  downwards (from the wealthy to those in the lower middle and lower classes).  If we aren&#8217;t, as a society, making every attempt o move towards a fairer society with broad-based growth and reasonable distibution of resources, in my view, we will inexorably move towards a much less fair society in which the resources are constantly allocated to the advantage of the wealthy and powerful.</p>
<p>I see that Maule responded, asking <a target="_blank" href="http://mauledagain.blogspot.com/#4361919843301975555">&#8220;If a Wealth-Dominated Congress is So Great, Why are Taxation and Other Policies such a Mess?</a> (Jan 13, 2010).  Maule says much of what I say here and focuses on whether having wealthy and &#8220;successful&#8221; people in Congress is really better for the country than having more &#8220;ordinary&#8221; people who haven&#8217;t been able to acquire significant wealth.  He concludes that this Congress could learn from the practical experience and wisdom of ordinary people.  I heartily agree.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t visit the web-site <a target="_blank" href="http://economistmom.com/">EconomistMom</a> much because Diane has hinted a while back that I was being rude, and like a good party guest does, took the hint and left. But my eye was caught by the caption and the very nice illustration to this post <a target="_blank" href="http://economistmom.com/2010/01/yes-deficit-hawks-can-have-their-cake-and-eat-it-too/">Yes Deficit Hawks Can Have Their Cake and Eat it Too</a>, decided to drop in and found a conversation between olde acquaintances Bruce Bartlett, Jim Glass and commenter Brooks. I don&#8217;t want to copy Bartlett&#8217;s exact comment without his consent, so to see it and my reply, you may have to visit. Go ahead, I&#8217;ll wait below the fold.<a name="more"></a><br />_____________________________<br />Back now? Good.</p>
<p>For those of you who didn&#8217;t go the short version of my comment is that the strategy to get major slashes to Social Security and Medicare takes an Seven Step and that this technique is not new and in fact mirrors the original plan for Bush&#8217;s Commission to Strengthen Social Security (CSSS) in 2001-2002.</p>
<p>Step one. Get consensus on &#8216;Crisis&#8217;. In this case that current debt growth levels are unsustainable.<br />Step two. Get consensus that there are only three possible paths out: revenue increases (A), cuts in military and other discretionary spending (B1 and B2), or cuts to non-discretionary spending, meaning Medicare and Social Security (C)<br />Step three: Having agreed that some combination of A, B, and C is needed set up a Commission with a mandate to propose an up or down vote.<br />Step four. Committee decides it is unwise to increase taxes during a recession and eliminates (A). Commission further decides that it is unwise to cut defense spending in the middle of two wars eliminating (B1) and that eliminating infrastructure spending or farm supports is both unwise or politically impossible in the current climate (B2)<br />Step five. Recommend a package of cuts to Medicare and Social Security-C on the basis of shared sacrifice, after all every CD and State has a share of the elderly population.<br />Step Six: Tell Congress that the statute doesn’t allow them to revisit A or B and then that NOT voting for a C based solution means denial of Steps one and two.<br />Seven: Either get a vote for C or run against opponents as ‘Do Nothing Deficit Deniers”</p>
<p>This was exactly the plan used by the Bush Administration in their Spring 2005 Social Security Tour. Rather than produce a Plan already in hand crafted to specifications, say like Model 2 of CSSS, and have people pick it to pieces, they held it back for a later stage. . So the proposed sequence there was:</p>
<p>Step A: Use Social Security Tour to get consensus on Social Security Crisis<br />Step B: Use tour to assure everyone that all options were on the table.<br />Step C: Having gotten consensus from Congress try to find some mechanism to assure a final up or down vote.<br />Step D: Having secured a vote indicate that any plan MUST comply with the seven existing guidelines of CSSS <a target="_blank" href="http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/csss/index.htm">Guiding Principles to CSSS</a> which bar any tax-based solution and mandate private accounts.<br />Step E: Remind Congress that they promised an up or down vote and that refusal just meant being in denial of what was conceded in step one and two.<br />Step F: Either get a vote to &#8216;reform&#8217; Social Security or use a denial to go for a major victory in the 2006 mid-terms.</p>
<p>In 2005 Bush mostly got stopped at Step A. Since his proposal was narrowly focused on Social Security, a &#8216;There is No Crisis&#8217; narrative WITHIN the Social Security context was able to get traction. This time we are on a very different track, instead of selling this as a proposal for an &#8216;Ownership Society&#8217; (where the numbers were pretty easily debunked), it is being sold as a matter of &#8216;Intergenerational Equity&#8217; and &#8216;Fiscal Responsibility&#8217;. And from that starting point Step one is pretty much in the bag and logic gets you mostly through Step two.</p>
<p>Leaving us where? Well we are within a week of a vote on Step three of the first list and if it passes steps four through seven pretty much follow automatically, they may not work but I would hate to have to bet on it. Meaning that we need to stop Step three by convincing people that Step four is already in the bag. So called &#8216;Deficit Hawks&#8217; strongly overlap with &#8216;Tax Hawks&#8217; and with &#8216;Military Hawks&#8217;. Moreover they are largely from farm states and not likely to vote for big cuts there. Which really leaves only one question in my mind, do they stop with proposing big slashes to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid? Or make new runs at Urban Transit, Community Develpment, or (non-military) Foreign Aid?</p>
<p>I suspect they know better than to get too ambitious and will instead just strike at Entitlements as such.</p>
<p>A last note on Bartlett who revealed too much. In noting that while open to tax increases in principle history showed that while Congress couldn&#8217;t help cutting future tax increases back (as with AMT), both Congress and people allowed the benefit cuts in the 1983 Reform to occur on schedule. Since future wage working retirees actually decided to go along with that for the general good while the wealthy would predictably resist paying taxes for that same general welfare that we should just go with the benefit cuts. Because they were &#8216;doable&#8217;.</p>
<p>So workers are &#8216;doable&#8217;. Which puts us &#8216;working guys&#8217; into a whole new category, except in this case we are paying the Johns.</p>

<p>I am glad you clarified your position.  How you get from &#8220;the bond market is in a bad way because of the entirely forseeable payout from the Trust Fund&#8221; to&#8230; &#8220;Social Security needs to be reformed&#8230; by turning it into welfare&#8221;&#8230; is not so clear.   It seems to me that if the government doesn&#8217;t like the consequences to the bond market of having to pay back Social Security by borrowing from the public, it could raise taxes.  Say, back to the economy crippling levels under Clinton.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have anything to do with the way Angry Bear posts, but I will forward this to those who do. <i>(Rdan&#8230;js kit has limits unless you pay a lot more, but send me a doc anytime)<br /></i><br />What you are proposing is that the working people of America be hurt badly in order to make life easier for bond traders. I don&#8217;t buy the world will come to an end argument if the Bond traders go into a funk.  But you would be right that I know nothing about that.  I just don&#8217;t take kindly to being threatened by rich people.  I&#8217;ve seen them do it too often.</p>
<p>by Bruce Krasting</p>
<p>Morning. I put a response to this together. You might actually like it. I have trouble posting on your comments page. This is long. I hacked it up to meet yourr requirements, (5k letters) but this makes it look silly.</p>
<p>Is there a better way to post this? I hate to do it a paragraph at a time. Can you over-ride those limits and post this for me? Let me know.<br />bk<br /><i>(Rdan&#8230;There is almost no editing except to make this post flow in format. I hope it suits. I think this is better as a post and not in comments anyway)<br /></i><br />KRASTING and COBERLY in COMPLETE AGREEMENT</p>
<p>Well not exactly. But I think that Coberly has done a good job of making my case. I will go through some of his latest comments to demonstrate how we agree. But first I have to try to insert into this discussion another of those “facts” that I rely on. This “fact” is outside of Coberly and Webb’s understanding, or if they understand it they fail to see the significance of it. In plain language:</p>
<p>If the US bond market becomes unstable all of the lights will go out. Including the lights at SS.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Angry Bear readers may not agree with that statement, they may think it another lunatic assertion by me. But this time I am right. If you disagree you are not well read on the issues of the times and you are living in a cave. There are endless academics that would agree with this and there is a very large chunk of the folks at the Federal Reserve and Treasury that would agree with it. Suspend your disbelief for a moment. Assume that this law of nature is in fact correct. </p>
<p>What might cause the bond market to become unstable? Many factors. Almost all of them are in place today. Crazy excessive deficits that are projected to exceed $1 trillion a year for the next decade are front and center to the problem. The dollar’s status as a reserve currency is another. Sentiment on this critical issue is very fickle, when it goes, it causes problems. There are a host of other issues including America’s cronic current account deficits. But now there is another factor that is not now being considered, and that is the status of the Social Security Trust Fund. </p>
<p>I ask Angry Bear readers to consider the implications of this headline should it ever occur: </p>
<p>“CHINA TO STOP BUYING US TREASURY DEBT.  WILL SELL THEIR HOLDINGS OF $1 TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE.”</p>
<p>We will not see that headline. China is not stupid. They know that if they took action like this it would have a devastating affect on the US capital markets. Interest rates would soar. The bond market would become unstable. Our ability to finance ourselves in an orderly way would be impaired. Interest rates would rise and the economy would suffer. China would suffer as well from their actions. Man Bites Dog.</p>
<p>There would be one of two results from this. Either it would precipitate a very rapid collapse or it would result in a slower pace (2-3 years) of collapse. Let me be very clear. The US can’t afford 8% interest rates. The cost of the deficit would eat us alive. We would not be able to sell new debt at a cost we could afford. These conditions would certainly cause a severe recession (or worse). In my opinion a failure of the bond market would be the mother of all systemic risks. Housing would collapse if mortgage rates went to 10%. Banks would be closing left and right as the economy loses jobs. Unemployment would explode. The number of workers contributing to SS would fall by as much as 20%.  The ratios of total income (including the tax on benefits) would collapse. Large annual deficits would be the result to the Fund. They would have to sell back to Treasury their IOU’s to raise the necessary cash. But what would Treasury do? At the time this is happening Treasury will be in a desperate battle to sell the debt that is necessary just to avoid a functional default. The result would be that the checks would not go out as planned. Mr. Webb has said that in a worse case situation like this that is exactly what would happen. SS would wait until it has collect sufficient taxes to make the benefit payments. The implication of that is that we would be in a very dark and deep depression.</p>
<p>So if you buy into the consequences of China selling off its Treasury holdings how would you react to this very similar but more significant announcement:</p>
<p>SSTF TO STOP BUYING US TREASURY DEBT. WILL SELL THEIR HOLDINGS OF $2.5 TRILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE.</p>
<p>I think we will get that headline. I think we are much closer than people think to getting that headline.  I think we will get this news sometime in the next three years. When we get this headline it will make a difference, it will destabilize the bond market. It will be more significant than if China stopped buying (and started selling) our bonds.</p>
<p>Mr. Coberly agrees with my assertion that the economics of the Fund have been hit very hard as a result of the 08 and 09 recession. We disagree on what are the implications, and what should be done about it. For example: </p>
<p>Coberly writes:<br />I made a clear enough case that the cost increasing faster than the income was well understood and predicted a long time ago. that is what the trust fund was designed to take care of. it was always intended to &#8220;run out of money&#8221; to be replaced either by increasing the tax or cutting benefits. </p>
<p>BK: Yes Dale the Fund was always intended to run out of money. You are 100% correct. But no one anticipated that the ‘tipping point’ for this to happen would be 2009. We thought it was 2016. The recession of 08 has excellerated the time frame dramatically. That has been my point from the get-go.</p>
<p>Coberly writes::<br />what you are saying here is that the government has to pay back the money it borrowed from Social Security. what is there about paying back money that you borrowed that you don&#8217;t understand?</p>
<p>BK: I understand completely. But what you fail to understand is that to do so in the context of the other pressures on the bond market will result in a systemic problem. These are very big numbers we are talking about. Were it not for the other pressures on us fiscally I would not be so concerned about the SSTF become a seller of Bonds versus the traditional buyer. But those other pressures do exist. They are with us today and we can’t shed them. SS is going into deficit  at a very inconvenient time.</p>
<p>On the critical issue that I have been trying to make re the bond market and the inter-relationship to the SSTF Coberly says:<br />You may be right. the Bond market may have put itself into a stupid position. This does not give you the right to cripple Social Security. What you are proposing is theft.</p>
<p>BK: Okay, so finally I am right about something. Coberly is spot on with this observation. Forces far outside of SS have put the bond market (aka the entire economy) in a ‘stupid’ position and this is in no way the fault of the Fund. But unfortunately the Fund will find itself being in the position of contributing to the instability that will follow from their actions. It can’t and won’t be allowed to happen.</p>
<p>Coberly writes:<br />Note that Krasting keeps making the same argument. He hasn&#8217;t even noticed the argument against him. He keeps arguing that the Trust Fund has gone cash flow negative, and may do so even more in the future. He keeps ignoring that it was designed to do that. It was created as a &#8220;rainy day fund.&#8221; He is complaining because his bond traders have been counting on it never being used. Because he forgot that&#8217;s what it was created for.</p>
<p>BK: Again 100% correct. I have made the case again and again that what was supposed to be happening in a decade or so is happening ‘today’. The Fund is doing EXACTLY what it was designed to do. But it is happening at a very bad time. Again, not the fault of the Fund, they did not cause the recession that has hurt them so badly. But, if as I assert (and I think that Coberly would agree to) that this tipping point is happening in 2010 and 2011 it is a very significant event for the broader economy and the markets.</p>
<p>Coberly writes:<br />the problems of the fixed income market are it&#8217;s own problems. the purpose of the Social Security Trust Fund is NOT to underwrite the fixed income market. if you have been counting on it to do so, you have been making a mistake. bond buyers often do.</p>
<p>BK:This sentence goes right to the heart of this entire discussion. Coberly is 100% correct when he says,” the purpose of the Social Security Trust Fund is NOT to underwrite the fixed income market”. SS was never intended to be the significant factor that is has become in the capital structure of the US. But it has, and that is just a reality. Coberly is equally correct when he says,” if you have been counting on it to do so, you have been making a mistake”. I have not been counting on SS for nearly a year. That is when I first noticed the significant acceleration of the timing for the FUND to go to negative annual cash flow. What I maintain is that this phenomenon that Coberly and I see happening is not priced into the markets. When this reality that we see becomes more broadly understood it will impact markets and the economy. That is all I care about.</p>
<p>Coberly views the Fund in a vacuum. He thinks that what goes on in terms of the ‘aging’ of the Fund is irrelevant to markets/the economy in general. He does not see the connection of a weak economy and the Fund’s ability to perform its obligations. I am surprised at that. To me, the 09 results confirmed that the Fund has turned a significant corner and it is doing it 5-6 years earlier than was thought possible just a short while ago. To me, that is a very significant. </p>
<p>This debate has become tedious. Let’s give it a rest for a while. We need to re-revisit the status of the Fund in six months. By then we will have a new Trustee report, we will also have six months of additional data. I believe that the Report will contain strong language on the need to address the growing imbalances. I believe that the monthly data that will come in will support that conclusion. As far as the Fund is concerned, 2016 has now become 2010. </p>
<p>I feel deeply frustrated at my inability to successfully convey my concerns regarding the Fund. I wish I were a more skilled writer. I wish I had the status of Coberly and Webb who can dismiss what I see and have people therefore ignore my concerns. </p>
<p>No, I am not an expert. I am a hack. But this hack sees trouble brewing on the topic of SS and how it fits into the “Big Picture”. I think it will be in the News and in the Markets before this year is over. We shall just have to wait and see if I am right or not about the market/economic implications of what both Coberly and I see happening in front of our eyes.</p>
