                                <p>by Linda Beale</p>
<p>I&#8217;m attending the American Association of Law Schools conference in New Orleans, where cold winds are blowing but revelry of Mardi Gras has already begun.  This morning Jeff Gordon presented his views on what it will take to deal with the systemic risk to the banking system to avoid crises like the one we have been through.  He supports creating an explicit authority for innovative action to be taken by bank regulators. </p>
<p>The problem he says is that banks act as intermediaries between short-term depositors and long-term borrowers of funds.  Their position is &#8220;fragile&#8221; in that there is a possible contagion effect from counterparty risk and &#8220;similarity risk&#8221;.  If one bank goes bad, depositors can reasonably assume that similar banks may go bad.  But they are not sure how similar one bank is to another, so the risk is difficult to gauge.  Also there is problem with uncertainty generally, that adds to the systemic risk.</p>
<p>The macroprudential means suggested to combat these problems aren&#8217;t sufficient.  Deposit insurance, limits on leverage and similiar approaches don&#8217;t necessarily achieve liquidity to avoid credit crunches while ensuring protection for banks.  Deposit insurance is only payable after a default.  Limits on leverage are no guarantee.  The shadow banking system of off balance sheet vehicles and money market funds as credit providers isn&#8217;t a sufficient answer either&#8211;it relies on banking but is unwilling to pay the costs. </p>
<p>Gordon says that Bernanke and Paulson had to &#8220;scare&#8221; the country to get the power to do what was needed to deal with the crisis, but that &#8220;scare&#8221; also had the effect of pushing the country deeper into the crisis.  Since systemic risk is inevitable, we should crate a TARP-like program to be waiting in the wings for the future.</p>
<p>Other mechanisms for dealing with systemic risk once it occurs, he claims, are inadequate.  One mechanism is to have failing institutions merge with a healthier institution.  But this is inadequate, as shown in the Lehman situation last fall.  SHareholders want more than the bank is worth, and the government, prior to default, can&#8217;t impose losses on creditors.</p>
<p>Another is for a federal agency, like the FDIC, to take over failing banks.  But this is problematic, since it is a firm-by-firm proposition, whereas systemic risk involves widespread problems that cannot be sufficiently resolved on a case by case basis.</p>
<p>The only solution then is a &#8220;standby&#8221; emergency authority.  He would have a &#8220;triple key&#8221; system to ensure the authority is not abused and thus will not represent a threat to democracy.  His triple key proposal in the talk was a consensus among the Fed, Treasury and FDIC.  Further, he&#8217;d require notice to Congress, and an ex post review to ensure accountability.</p>
<p>Does this proposal for a permanent &#8220;standby&#8221; authority to take hugely costly discretionary actions &#8220;as needed&#8221; to resolve a financial crisis make sense?  I worry much more about the democracy deficit of such a proposal than Gordon apparently does.  Even where Congress approves the power, as in the TARP bill, the lack of oversight and the establishment of a cozy relationship with the regulated entities, as in the case of Paulson, Bernanke, and Goldman and other banks, is worrisome.  Notice to Congress would likely be perfunctory if Congressional approval weren&#8217;t required, and ex post review is not often well done&#8211;look at our failure to conduct an open review of the many lapses of the Bush administration on torture, etc.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t the fact that the authority was forthcoming when needed in this case show that we don&#8217;t need the &#8220;standby&#8221; authority that would grant even more discretion to a few powerful hands on the pursestrings of the nation?</p>

<p>The <a href="http://english.customs.gov.cn/publish/portal191/">Customs Administration</a> announced record trade flows in and out of China in December. Specifically, exports grew at a 17.7% annual pace, while imports surged 55.9% over the year. This is a remarkable one-month rebound; reported export growth beat consensus expectations by a factor of 3.5 (+ 5% export growth and + 32.5% import growth, according to Bloomberg).</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0oDWXiCjEI/AAAAAAAACxM/ud_uRXuK9yI/s1600-h/CHINA_tb.PNG"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0oDWXiCjEI/AAAAAAAACxM/ud_uRXuK9yI/s400/CHINA_tb.PNG"></a>China is experiencing robust domestic demand growth, as illustrated by the surge in imports. Furthermore, there is likely significant price pressure built into this report since the data are measured in nominal $USD. The December trade report suggests that inflation pressures are underway in China&#8217;s economy; expect a big jump in coming inflation reports.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the government allows the yuan to appreciate sooner, rather than later, in light of this report.</p>

                                <p>by cactus</p>
<p>Last week I found out I was turned down for a life insurance policy.  Some background &#8211; I&#8217;m 40, I don&#8217;t drink, smoke or take any drugs or pharmaceuticals, am neither overweight nor underweight according to any table you might look at, and I exercise vigorously an hour a day, rain or shine. I don&#8217;t have any life-threatening hobbies.  Three of my grandparents lived into their nineties, as did most of my great grandparents.  I have no debt other than a mortgage, but that plus property taxes comes to about 11% of my monthly income, so I don&#8217;t have any major money worries either.  I&#8217;m a good candidate for living a very long time.  But it seems my cholesterol level was too high.</p>
<p>Now here&#8217;s the interesting thing&#8230;  the insurance company sent someone over to do a physical at my house.  When they called to make an appointment, I asked whether it was necessary to prepare in any way.  Perhaps I should fast or something?  After all, I had to do that before some physicals in the past.  Not necessary to prepare in any way, I was told.  </p>
<p>Fast forward a few weeks to when I got turned down.  I did some checking on-line.  It turns out that exercising for an hour thirty minutes before a cholesterol test is a fine way to boost one&#8217;s cholesterol level.  And a few before that is another.  Had I known this I would have done neither of these two things.  Now, perhaps I should have figured out ahead of time that there hadn&#8217;t been any new advances in cholesterol testing since my last physical, but every so often I&#8217;ll succumb to trusting an expert.  Big mistake.</p>
<p>Now, the insurance company has said they cannot give me the plan we discussed, but they can provide me with some other plans, plans that pay much less and cost quite a bit more.  Which sounds to me like a rip-off. So the Chicago School would indicate that I should call some other life insurance company and go through the process with them, this time fasting for twelve hours prior to the test and abstaining from exercising that day.  But there&#8217;s a problem&#8230;  one of the first things a life insurance company wants to know when you call them up is whether you&#8217;ve ever been turned down for life insurance.  </p>
<p>Its a neat little racket&#8230; <br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush<br /><strong>UPDATED:</strong> Jim Watt  Remember him?</p>
<p>If you did not see it, go watch this weeks <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/01082010/watch.html">Bill Moyers Journal.</a>  Part 2<a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/01082010/watch2.html"> is here</a>.</p>
<p>From the second part we get all we need to know about where we&#8217;re going regarding government for, of and by the people and how little regard there is at the top for the seriousness of such a declaration and its implementation in perpetuity. </p>
<p>BILL MOYERS: Let me show you something that Ben Bernanke said to the annual meeting of economists earlier this week, last Sunday, I think it was. </p>
<p><em>BEN BERNANKE: The best response to the housing bubble would have been regulatory, not monetary. Stronger regulation and supervision aimed at problems with underwriting practices and lenders&#8217; risk management would have been a more effective and surgical approach for constraining the housing bubble than a general increase in interest rates. </em></p>
<p>DAVID CORN: Whoops. </p>
<p>BILL MOYERS: Whoops what? </p>
<p>DAVID CORN: Well, now he&#8217;s saying what a lot of us said earlier? That we should have had better regulation, you know, rather than just fiddling with interest rates?&#8230;</p>
<p>BILL MOYERS: You have a great chart in your story in &#8220;Mother Jones&#8221; on that. </p>
<p>DAVID CORN: I mean, my favorite one that I wrote about, and I don&#8217;t know him personally. He could be a great guy. Never even met him. I tried to interview him, but he wouldn&#8217;t consent. <strong>Mark Patterson. He&#8217;s the chief of staff for Timothy Geithner, the Treasury Department Secretary. He was a lobbyist for Goldman Sachs. What did he do as a lobbyist for Goldman Sachs? He lobbied against a bill in the Senate to restrain it was a very modest bill, to restrain CEO compensation. </strong></p>
<p>Basically, gave shareholders the right to say, &#8220;We think you&#8217;re paying them too much.&#8221; It wasn&#8217;t even mandatory. It wouldn&#8217;t even cut back pay. He you know, Goldman Sachs would have none of that. He lobbied against that bill. <strong>Who authored that bill? Barack Obama, when he was a Senator.</strong> <strong>So, the guy who fought Barack Obama on CEO pay, an issue that Barack Obama says he cares about. And I believe he does.</strong> <strong>Is now running the Treasury Department for Tim Geithner.</strong> I mean, this really doesn&#8217;t make a lot of sense to me. </p>
<p>Yeah. Makes no sense to me either. In fact, the only mind that can make sense of such dichotomy in purpose and intent is a schizophrenic mind.</p>
<p>UPDATE<br />In responding to a comment by Guest who I assume is Cantab (we forget to check our sign-in names, Oh well), I mentioned James Watt.</p>
<p>Jim Watt&#8217;s experiences during and after his term as Secretary of the Interior is the perfect book end to Mark Patterson mentioned above. Back when Jim boy was Secretary, he got his ass booted. Sure, he created some messes. He was after all, the prototype for what we have in our administrative offices of our government. </p>
<p>From <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_G._Watt">Wiki:</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>For over two decades, Watt held the record for protecting the fewest species under the Endangered Species Act in United States history&#8230; According to the environmental groups, Watt decreased funding for environmental programs,[5] restructured the department to decrease federal regulatory power,[5] wished to eliminate the Land and Water Conservation Fund (which had been designed to increase the size of National Wildlife Refuges and other protected land),[5] eased regulations on oil[5] and mining[6][5] companies, and favored opening wilderness areas and shorelands for oil and gas leases.[5]&#8230;In 1983, Watt banned The Beach Boys from playing a Fourth of July concert on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., saying that rock concerts drew &#8220;an undesirable element&#8221;; the group had played each year on the Mall on the Fourth of July from 1976 to 1981.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, unlike <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2009/07/30/obama-medal-freedom/">Bush&#8217;s Metal of Freedom winners</a>, Watt&#8217;s got booted. Sure, it took this to do it: <br />
<blockquote>A public controversy erupted after a speech by Watt on September 21, 1983, when he said about his staff: &#8220;I have a black, a woman, two Jews and a cripple. And we have talent.&#8221;[13] Within weeks of making this statement, Watt submitted his resignation letter.[13][14]</p></blockquote>
<p>but at least it was done. Not now though. Such countervailing, diametric behavior is apparently immune to public desire. </p>
<p>Worse though, is the loss of memory when people acted up-front. Jim Watt&#8217;s never hide his ideology. Also is the loss of memory of what justice used to mean in America: <br />
<blockquote>In 1995, Watt was indicted on 25 counts of felony perjury and obstruction of justice by a federal grand jury.[15] The indictments were due to false statements made to a grand jury investigating influence peddling at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which he had lobbied in the mid to late 1980s. On January 2, 1996, as part of a plea bargain, Watt pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor count of withholding documents from a federal grand jury. On March 12, 1996 he was sentenced to five years&#8217; probation and ordered to pay a $5,000 fine and perform 500 hours of community service.[16]</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we call it “politicizing government”.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This article is roughly 24 hours late, but I do have additional points to the headline numbers. From <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">the BLS</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Nonfarm payroll employment edged down (-85,000) in December, and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 10.0 percent, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today. Employment fell in construction, manufacturing, and wholesale trade, while temporary help services and health care added jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>The monthly shift in the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/empsit.pdf">December nonfarm payroll</a> is practically a mirror image of the month that initiated the cyclical downturn, January 2008 when the payroll fell 72k (after revisions). Not because of the similar level values, but because of the mix: it is the goods-sector employment that is dragging the aggregate number, whereas the service-sector is just barely below zero. Actually, the private sector services payroll, 80% of the total service payroll, hired 17,000 more workers in net in December.</p>
<p>The volatility over the last two months has been driven primarily by the service sector. As illustrated in the chart below, the first-difference of the goods-sector payroll is approaching the coveted &#8220;0&#8221; threshold level, but at a much slower pace that is its service counterpart.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0ib6EKRYoI/AAAAAAAACw0/DOSbcGpFZZs/s1600-h/payroll_sector.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0ib6EKRYoI/AAAAAAAACw0/DOSbcGpFZZs/s320/payroll_sector.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The durable-goods jobs should turn up soon, at least the 64% of its payroll that is manufacturing. The <a href="http://www.ism.ws/ISMReport/MfgROB.cfm">ISM employment diffusion index</a> has been above 50 for three consecutive months. And with a 78% correlation between the 3-month lead of the index and annual manufacturing jobs growth, there is hope for January 2010. However, look for ISM diffusion index values around 53 (the average ISM value that correlates with >=0% manufacturing jobs growth) to forecast positive annual jobs growth. We are just barely there.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0icBAQRbYI/AAAAAAAACw8/wGZ9Vz_ftt8/s1600-h/ism_man_chart.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0icBAQRbYI/AAAAAAAACw8/wGZ9Vz_ftt8/s320/ism_man_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>It does seem that, as expected, the service sector (86% of December’s payroll) will pull the labor market back in positive territory in coming months.</p>
<p>From the Household Survey, the unemployment rate went unchanged in December at 10%. However, this is hardly good news; simple math says this rate will hover in the 9%-10% range throughout 2010 without a substantial pickup in the pace of employment growth. The reason is that the category &#8220;not in labor force&#8221; has grown by 3.4 million since May 2009.</p>
<p>If the number of unemployed persons falls each month over the next year by its 2005-2006 average, -48k, and just a quarter of the additional &#8220;not in labor force&#8221; persons since May (842k) re-enter at an average pace of 70k per month to find immediate employment, the unemployment rate will be 9.5% by December 2010. My point is: a serious growth momentum is needed to generate jobs, one that is not expected until initial unemployment claims drop significantly below their <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ui/current.htm">current 434k-level</a> (week ending Jan. 2).</p>
<p>Of note, average hourly earnings rose 3 cents per hour in December to $18.80/hour. Ostensibly, this is good news for the price stability picture. However, the y/y numbers are strikingly low, just 2.2% growth in earnings since December 2008. By this measure, wage pressures are extremely muted, which is another reason that the Fed may not be too quick to exit.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0idmyc_ljI/AAAAAAAACxE/Ogp7QMUbidw/s1600-h/earnings_chart.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S0idmyc_ljI/AAAAAAAACxE/Ogp7QMUbidw/s320/earnings_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart illustrates annual earnings growth and the unemployment rate. It wouldn&#8217;t be a stretch to expect wage growth to fall further, given the sharp upward trajectory of the unemployment rate.</p>
<p>There will likely be some volatility in coming months, specifically in April and May, when the Census hires temporary workers (6 weeks at $25/hour for 20 hours each week). <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2009/12/2010-census-economic-impact-probably.html">Here is something I wrote</a> about the Census hires some time ago.</p>
<p>Of note, the BLS is beefing up its report. Effective February 5, 2010 (the January 2010 employment release), the establishment survey will include more detail on hours and earnings, including those broken down by gender.</p>

                                <p>In the news over the past couple of days, I have heard the concealed explosives of the Undiebomber described as &#8220;weapons of mass destruction.&#8221;</p>
<p>To me, this didn&#8217;t sound quite right &#8212; in fact, it sounded like a naming convention the Bush administration might have used.</p>
<p>To check whether this was just me, I first stopped in at Wikipedia, where I found:<br />
<blockquote>A weapon of mass destruction (WMD) is a weapon that can kill large numbers of humans and/or cause great damage to man-made structures (e.g. buildings), natural structures (e.g. mountains), or the biosphere in general. The scope and application of the term has evolved and been disputed, often signifying more politically than technically. Coined in reference to aerial bombing with chemical explosives, it has come to distinguish large-scale weaponry of other technologies, such as chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear. This differentiates the term from more technnical ones such as chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear weapons (CRBN).</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, knocking down an airplane with an explosive is a major act of destruction, but does it qualify as deployment of a WMD?  I wouldn&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>Taking down four planes, two enormous buildings and part of a third building is a huge act of destruction, but there aren&#8217;t any WMDs involved there either, unless you count the two towers themselves, the dust from which has yielded distinctly WMD-like effects.</p>
<p>So who then made the decision to call the PETN, as destructive as it undoubtedly is, a WMD,  and up the terrorism ante from failed airplane bomber to a wielder of thunderbolts?<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I found a December 25th CNN article comparing Richard Reid (another plane bomb failure, eight years ago) to Abdulmutallab, and using the term WMD. Checking further using Google News, I found this graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_MSuZ1riS9qU/S0fkASKlGmI/AAAAAAAAAYg/T_sP6sWLsh4/s1600-h/wmd+timeline.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_MSuZ1riS9qU/S0fkASKlGmI/AAAAAAAAAYg/T_sP6sWLsh4/s400/wmd+timeline.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>It looks like my intuition  is right and the WMD usage was indeed a Bush hangover, though the term itself originated years previous to the run-up to the Iraq war.</p>
<p>Perhaps the media should be more careful, since WMDs are generally held to be biological, chemical or nuclear weapons, not common items like PETN, used in small caliber ammunition, land mines and shells, and as the explosive core of detonation cord.</p>
<p>A better phrase might be &#8220;weapon.&#8221;  Or, for extreme cases,  &#8220;big weapon.&#8221;</p>

<p>In my view you can boil Supply Side down to a simple aphorism: &#8220;If you tax something, people will use less of it&#8221;. And all things being equal and depending on how you define &#8216;something&#8217; this seems economically and psychologically plausible, higher prices drive down demand. Unfortunately in the real world all things are not equal and many different incentives bear on demand, meaning we need to take a deeper look.</p>
<p>In Supply Side theory income tax is a tax on work and so serves to have workers do less of it with the easy corollary of less tax, more work, Tax Cut = Increased Productivity. Well I&#8217;ll let Spencer and Cactus do the heavy lifting and correlation, I suggest instead that Supply Side is simply caught up in a simple conceptual confusion.</p>
<p>In reality America doesn&#8217;t tax work either in its scientific or more normal sense, we don&#8217;t tax people at X pennies/Joule, instead we tax consumption or income or property, none of which have any necessary connection to actual amounts of work or for that matter skill, a Trust Fund Baby gains income and consumes things based on income and capital accumulation done by other people. So if the income tax doesn&#8217;t tax work, what does it tax? And what are the logical consequences of that? For an impressionistic answer follow me below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Now the &#8216;well duh&#8217; answer it clear, an income tax taxes income, and so reduces people&#8217;s use of it in favor of the state. But this model while reasonable enough to explain early medieval taxation where tax, tithes and rent were all largely composed of slices taken off the top of income/productivity. later medieval and then modern taxation started building in controls that set taxation levels based on how total income was used and so taxation began to break down into two more distinct categories. One category was a tax on property, which could include real or personal property, together or separate. This is a tax on past consumption. The second category is a tax on current consumption.</p>
<p>And this is what puts the pseudo in supply side psychology. Its governing assumption, which is buried so deep as to be invisible to those trapped by it, that the goal of work is accumulation rather than consumption. In this world-view the governing rule is ROI. But I suggest that historically this hasn&#8217;t been the rule at all, humans didn&#8217;t come down from the trees with ledger books under our arms, instead humans target levels of consumption and just as importantly the leisure with which to do it.</p>
<p>As I note time and again, I am not an economist and as such not bound by any particular theory, nor by any supposed &#8216;truth&#8217; of a given &#8216;Law&#8217;, instead my training was in history which for this purpose can be defined as the study of what actually happened. And if you examine world history you see that past civilizations mostly valued the concepts of display and largesse, both mythically and practically the role of the King was to bring peace and abundance, which is to say the possibility for consumption and the leisure to enjoy it. And nobody liked a stingy and miserly King, King Midas was not a sympathetic character. Nor for that matter was simple accumulation valued, the peddler/tinker/money lender being largely restricted to people on the margins or even outside of society (Gypsies/Roma, Jews, Irish Travellers, in ancient times Greeks and Phoenicians).</p>
<p>The ascent of the merchant from its former position outside and/or below the social structure to be ultimately assmililated within that structure and largely between the farmer/artisan and the warrior/aristocrat happened at different paces in different places, for example in Rome you had a distinction between the Senatorial class, the Knights (Equites-originally a military class turned economic one) , and the People from early on while in England it was long understood that gentlemen did not engage in &#8216;Trade&#8217;. But the ultimate result of having the merchant class being elevated to the pinnacle of society and its chosen norms being established as natural &#8216;Laws of Economics&#8217; to some degree flies in the face of the history of society, the notion that everyone is born with an abacus or calculator in his head busily calculating ROI in the face of all variations is I think rather foreign to human nature as we see that expressed over the last few millennia and longer.</p>
<p>So if we take this cursory historical model and apply it to income taxes what do we see? Interestingly we see a model flipped on its head, rather than being a burden on capitalism, an income tax ends up incentivizing it.</p>
<p>If we regard total income as being a measure of potential consumption, then an income tax is first and foremost a tax on that potential consumption, per our simple aphorism people will do less of it. But this takes us two different directions. If the primary goal of humans is to target a consumption level and not accumulation as such, then the result of taxing consumption would be an intensification of work to get productivity up to the point that it compensated for the additional taking. If we start from consumption the result of more taxation is more work rather than less, or the opposite of what Supply Side psychology suggests. (And for those who are interested in such things there were some classic works by the Russian Chayanov in the early 20th century . http://www.answers.com/topic/alexander-chayanov In his Theory of Peasant Economy he showed with detailed statistical data how Russian peasants worked outside a capitalist accumulation model and instead on a consumption model where the intensity of the labor input varied over the family life-cycle and so could not be explained with either branch of Liberal Economics, neither the Manchester or the Marxist versions of economic development really fitting the realities of pre-modern rural history.)</p>
<p>But beyond the concept that taxes on income means taxes on consumption means an incentive to boost income to maintain consumption, there are some further wrinkles to explain why higher rates on income promote more economic input. Under our modern tax system, certain types of consumption are privileged over others. For example progressive tax rates and standard deductions are an explicit recognition that everyone has a right to some level of basic subsistence, which equally explains why we generally don&#8217;t tax groceries. On the other hand with sufficient progressivity in rates buying that classic Bugatti is going to cost you, in fact in 1958 it would have cost you 10X its sale price if measured in pre-tax income. On the other hand the tax rates were set up in such a way that you could shelter much of that income from taxes if you spent (invested) it in forms that could plausibly be shown to boost productivity overall. Now some of this simply ended up with tax avoidance of various types as consumption simply got shifted to the company ledger (the infamous &#8216;Unlimited Expense Account&#8217; ) but it did provide incentives for companies to reinvest gains rather than distribute them in the form of salaries which would then be exposed to high effective taxes when converted to consumption. In this model decreases in top rates meant increased pressure for management to expand compensation to take advantage of the reduced tax bite. On the flip side it meant that for any given employee maintaining the same level of consumption meant less work rather than more, or perhaps simply more consumption for the same amount of work.</p>
<p>A model that starts from the standpoint of consumption rather than accumulation as such is a much better fit for the actual social and economic history of the last half-century. As consumption taxes in the form of high marginal rates came down, the tendency of consumption and particularly conspicuous consumption went up. With the result that certain wealthy people couldn&#8217;t tell you off the top of their heads how many houses they owned, and Ken Lay thought it reasonable to have multiple mansions in the same ski resort. Both in the 80s and in the 00&#8217;s there was a huge boost in the size and extravagence of upper income spending where Supply Side insisted that the reaction should have been in the direction of greater investment. and increasing productivity.</p>
<p>This shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise to anyone, look around the world and ask yourself what has historically been the response of ultra-wealthy people who among other things are not exposed to tax: Buckingham Palace, Versailles, the Forbidden City, the Taj Majal, Nero&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domus_Aurea">Domus Aurea</a>. The ultimate fallacy of Supply Side is first to imagine that everyone has the temperment of a 19th century British Factory owner or Dutch Burgher intent beyond all on boosting the asset line in the ledger (though neither held back from consumption as such) and second to confuse a tax on income for a tax on work.</p>
<p>In Psupply-pside psychology the most rational man in the world, the epitome of Humanity is Ebeneezer Scrooge, Esq, a man so desperate to keep every stray farthing in his Okun Bucket that he would cut himself away from the world of consumption and leisure. If England had had an income tax in Scrooge&#8217;s time you might well see him cut back on his business rather than paying an extra pound to the Crown in tax. But then most of us are not sociopaths.</p>
<p>Taxes raise the marginal cost of exposed consumption and so decrease it leaving more income for reinvestment. Psychologically a lot more plausible than the idea that returning to Clinton or Reagan area rates means all the billionaires to go Galt on us. They seem to like their consumption where it is and can be expected to work to maintain it.</p>

                                <p>Bruce Bartlett&#8217;s December 15, 2009 piece, <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/bruce-bartlett/1326/rising-inequality-problem">Inequality: A Problem?, </a>states Bartlett&#8217;s agreement with Dalton Conley that<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;the left should stop worrying so much about inequality per se&#8211;its costs are overstated, as well as the benefits of greater equality. Instead &#8230;<br />liberals should concentrate more on helping the poor and less on beating up<br />the rich.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, before we even get into the inequality stuff, you&#8217;ll notice that the statement above is loaded with presuppositions. It pre-supposes that liberals are extraordinarily focused on &#8220;beating up the rich&#8221; and that they are not currently very interested in &#8220;helping the poor.&#8221; Further, it presupposes that whatever &#8220;beating up on the rich&#8221; involves, it cannot &#8220;help the poor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Are liberals focused on &#8220;beating up on the rich&#8221;? I expect Bartlett would point to bloggers (such as myself) as examples. I have rather persistently argued for higher taxation of the rich and super-rich through more progressive rates and elimination of the capital gains preference which results in low effective tax rates on those whose income is predominantly income from financial assets. The income tax changes over the last four decades have eroded progressivity&#8211;instead of the 70% or 90% rate that we had at times in the past on very high incomes, the super-rich with multimillions of adjusted gross income pay the same marginal rate as the merely rich who have more than about $350,000 annually. The rich and super-rich derive the most benefit from the biggest loopholes in the tax code, like the mortgage interest deduction, the charitable contribution deduction, and the property tax deduction. They are the ones who buy muni bonds and get to exclude the interest from income, so that the rate of return on munis is set with the rich as the targeted customer (high enough sp that the exclusion makes the return on munis (with no tax) better than the return on corporate bonds (after tax)). Is that line of argumentation &#8220;beating up on the rich&#8221;? No, quite assuredly it is not. The wealthy don&#8217;t merit punishment for being wealthy. But taxation is not punishment. Taxation is merely the exaction of appropriate tribute based on societal members&#8217; ability to pay, to ensure that the state can continue to function appropriately in service to all its citizens. Making the case that the status quo is overly solicitous of the rich and super-rich is not &#8220;beating up&#8221; on the rich.</p>
<p>Are progressives not &#8220;helping the poor&#8221; and in fact beating up on the rich rather than focusing on the poor? No and No. There are lots of ways to help the poor, including volunteering, giving to charities, and others. Many progressives are engaged in all of those ways of helping the poor. We mentor in schools, give to food kitchens as well as to environmental organizations, donate canned foods at Christmas, and work in our communities for better schools, better transportion, better jobs, better shelters, less discrimination. But none of those are enough in a society that has become stressfully bipolar between the well-to-do and the rest (not to mention, the making it okay and the truly down-and-out). Progressives, that is, cannot easily help the poor and ignore the way that wealth has eroded the democratic society in which we all exist, because that erosion is eating away at the possibilities for the poor to pull themselves out of poverty.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Bartlett goes on to say:<br />
<blockquote>I think he is right. I have never understood how I am worse off if<br />the top 1% of households increase their share of national wealth or income as long as the absolute level of wealth and income of the other 99% is<br />unchanged. It may be aesthetically displeasing, but it doesn&#8217;t impose any<br />actual costs on anyone as long as the pie is not fixed.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>(Beale here again) The growing income disparity is <em>not merely</em> aesthetically displeasing (which it is) or environmentally harmful (which it is, as the wealthy consume many times their share of the world&#8217;s resources in rambling from one multi-million mcmansion to another) or humiliating for many (which it is, especially for those growing numbers in the &#8220;servant&#8221; class who work at the whim of the wealthy and live in unsatisfactory conditions while watching the wealthy waste in a night what could feed their children for a year). It <em>does</em> impose costs, even if the pie is not fixed. Those costs include the long-term impact to broad-based growth when wealth becomes more and more concentrated in the hands of a very few. And one <em>is </em>worse off when the top 1% of the households increase their share of national wealth to the detriment of everyone else. A society with such wealth imbalances is a society that also has enormous power imbalances. Wealth creates power, and that power is almost invariably used to further the aims of those holding it. Democratic institutions are particularly vulnerable, since wealth and power permit the capture of agencies and legislatures, so that the institution is thwarted from serving the broader constitutency in order to do the bidding of the wealthy oligarchs who hold the reins to power. It is this sense in which the populist anger expressed by the teapartiers is most distressing&#8211;it is misdirected, seeing evil per se in government and good per se in &#8220;private enterprise&#8221; and unable to understand the important role of government in standing as protector between the private corporatocracy and citizens.</p>
<p>Bartlett continues:<br />
<blockquote>[N]either does it follow that there is no limit to how much we can soak the<br />rich without average people suffering some of the consequences. We really<br />don&#8217;t want the rich spending all their time figuring out how to hide their<br />wealth from the tax man or engaging in conspicuous consumption; we&#8217;d rather that they invested their wealth in businesses that will increase their wealth but also create jobs and income for the rest of us, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm. First, we are nowhere near &#8220;soaking the rich&#8221; in this country. IN fact, we have been making sure, with almost every change to tax policy undertaken in the last four decades, that the rich sat high and dry and comfortable. Moving them down a notch or two to the benches on the same level with the rest of us won&#8217;t begin to soak them&#8211;it will, in fact, hardly be felt. Second, while we definitely don&#8217;t want the rich spending all their time hiding their wealth, telling them that they can just keep it all without paying a fair share of taxes is not the alternative. Decent enforcement rules will go a long way to solving the problem of hiding wealth&#8211;broker reporting, which most think is going to happen this year, will help, but restoring funding to the government&#8217;s collection efforts and requiring more audits of the wealthy than of the Earned Income Tax Credit would be the best ideas. (I&#8217;m not even so sure that I don&#8217;t want the wealthy engaging in conspicuous consumption. AT least that way there would be less to pass down to heirs and less possibility of sustainable oligarchy.) Taxing the wealthy moves the dollars to the government, which moves the dollars out into businesses that provide services the government buys, and then those businesses invest the dollars. I like that better than depending on the wealthy to invest and create jobs for the rest of us. I fear they are just as likely to invest as they so often have in the past&#8211;in emerging economies where they suck out the natural resources and leave those populations without jobs or much to show for their foreign input, without doing a thing to create jobs here either.</p>
<p>Farther on, Bartlett suggests taxes cannot assist a move to less inequality because their only effect is &#8220;by discouraging the rich from earning income.&#8221; There the Chicago School thinking comes out&#8211;the idea that taxes distort decisions, and if you tax the income of the rich, they just will do without the income. No one has yet satisfactorily explained why the rich don&#8217;t still like 50% or 65% of $X better than 0% of new $X. The substitution of leisure for income is a possibility, of course, but that would actually not be bad at all, if it succeeded in capping the amount of wealth for one family and created a gap into which someone else could step to earn money. </p>
<p>Finally, Bartlett suggests that we should do what Europe has done, suggesting that Europe has accepted the compromise of VATs as a conservative tax along with extensive social welfare spending from that tax. This is misleading, since Europe generally has a VAT as a supplement to the income tax (and, in the case of France at least, a bunch of other taxes as well). And it is disingenuous, since tax policies that Bartlett has supported (zero taxation of capital gains) or, apparently, VAT instead of an income tax, would not raise enough in revenues to fund the huge military obligations of Iraq and Afghanistan as well as an improved welfare state. Methinks Bartlett&#8217;s version of acceptable social welfare spending would be significantly lower than most progressives&#8217;.</p>
<p>There is a lot in Bartlett&#8217;s statement that is worrisome, but perhaps the most for me is the disregard for the impact of inordinate inequality on democracy. Most of us don&#8217;t think about democracy very often, and we seldom talk about it among diverse groups in ways that can enhance its institutions and its sustainability. A discussion of inequality that so completely disregards the impact of the kinds of gross inequalities that we are seeing more of in this country&#8211;where a CEO may earn in half a day what an average worker in his company earns in an entire year, where every single member of the national body that is most influential on our laws (the Senate) is in the highest bracket of the income tax and &#8220;rich&#8221; in any reasonable measure of the benefits and burdens of society that they bear&#8211; is itself cause for concern for our future.</p>
<p>Another writer this month had similar thoughts. Christopher Hayes ends his article on &#8220;The Great Leap&#8221;, a story of China and its growth and expansion as a world financial power, with the following paragraph comparing the trends in the U.S. and China.</p>
<blockquote><p>We tend to view China as posing an alternative and threatening model for<br />the future, one that&#8217;s by turns seductive and repulsive, the source of envy and contempt. But after a while I wondered if we aren&#8217;t in some way converging with out supposed rival. China has managed the transition from a<br />repressive, authoritarian, impoverished country to an industrial, corporatist oligarchy by allowing a loud and raucous debate while also holding tightly onto power. Perhaps we are moving toward the same end from a democratic direction, the roiling public debate and political polarization obscuring the fact that power and money continue to collect and pool among an elite that increasingly views itself as besieged on all sides by a restive and ungrateful populace. Hayes, the Nation, Jan. 11/18, 2010, at 17.</p></blockquote>
