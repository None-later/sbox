                                <p>There is a light snow at the moment.  While the snow and icy roads are cleared here from yesterday, we shall see what kind of weather unfolds throughout the day.</p>
<p>The phone has been ringing steadily over the week end and Monday, with volunteer or robo calls from both senate candidates Martha Coakley and Scott Brown.  Sometimes the political ads during the day ran consecutively from different funding sources. The ceremonies for Martin Luther King took a backstage on this holiday. </p>
<p>There appears to be a lot of attempts at figuring out what is going on concerning the meteoric rise in the polls of Mr. Brown.  I assume most readers have a bit of background on this race, so I will not offer that here.  Of course, without the super-majority bar being pushed and accepted in the US Senate and a contentiously fought health insurance bill, this race would have less national coverage.</p>
<p>One needs to remember Massachusetts (is that spelled correctly? I spell it MA) has an electoral mind of its own.  It has 51% registered independents out of the pool of registered voters.  Even though there are three times the number of registered Democrats than registered Republicans (roughly 36% to 12%) we have had a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Republican govenor</a> for 16 years since William Weld took the position in 1991.</p>
<p>The state legislative bodies are overwhelmingly Democratic. </p>
<p>The 1972 national election saw MA being the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&#038;year=1972">only state going for George McGovern</a>, DC not being a state. The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?f=0&#038;year=1980">1980 national election</a> had MA split the vote 41.90% Reagan to 41.75% Carter, over 15% going to the Independent.</p>
<p>Whether this special election is a bellwether for a national trend or just a reflection of MA voter quirkiness and bad timing for any election to reflect a trend in overall voter sentiment (low turnout might make it more of a comment on political machine effectiveness and preparedness) is not something I feel comfortable expounding on from a knowlegeable perspective.  </p>
<p>I am going out to vote, and await results and implications.  So this is a topical thread I believe.</p>
<p>Update:  <a target="_ blank" href="http://www.truthout.org/massachusetts-election-live-blog56173">Heavy turnout at the polls</a></p>
<p>Update 2:  Martha Coakley concedes 9:24 tonight.</p>

        <p>This may be a reflection on how the health bill has/is been/being handled by Congress, and not the fact that people are opposed to a national health plan. People are opposed to their lack of influence, teh Democrats ramming through any POS bill, and lobbyists controlling teh content of teh bill.</p>

        <p>Maybe voters in Massachusetts, who already have a health care system similar to the current federal Health Care Reform legislation (insurance mandates and insufficient insurance cost controls), do not like the system that the Democratic candidate supports.</p>

        <p>All the ads I&#8217;ve seen or heard have had one thing in common with Brown: Milton Friedman econ theory.  If health care is an issue it is only in relation to the over all, primal thought that money is tight and a smaller less taxing government sounds like I&#8217;ll have more of it in my pocket if carried through. </p>
<p>People really just don&#8217;t get it that the lack of money in their pocket is the results of smaller governemnt, privatization and freer markets because they don&#8217;t see the wizard behind the curtain.</p>
<p>I think MA is a vulnerable to an emotional protest vote as any state.</p>

        <p>Couple issues here. First Coakley is an incredibly flawed candidate.  Couldn&#8217;t the Dems find someone competant to run for the People&#8217;s Seat?  Then she ran a horrible campaign &#8211; especially in the last few weeks. As one Dem pundit said,&#8221;What would be different if she was trying to lose?&#8221;</p>
<p>Brown is running on a populist platform and showed himself very adept at taking advantage of Coakley&#8217;s missteps.  He is also a good, solid candidate and handily won the debate.</p>
<p>Lastly Brown has been running against the horrible health-care bill in congress and has rode the populist outrage at both the bills contents and more paticularly the process.  Obama&#8217;s luke -warm indorsement of Coakley at the last minute now made it into a semi-referendum on the health care bill which will help Brown.  I think Obama flying in at the last minute will actually hurt Dems chances, not becuase he&#8217;s not popular himself, but his policies are not popular and it looks like desperation.  (Well it was desperation).</p>
<p>Considering voter fraud in Dem machine politics I expext Coakley to win in a squeker with lots of &#8220;found&#8221; ballots. See Washington State and Franken&#8217;s win for examples.  Only way Brown wins if its a blow-out (cheating only works if it&#8217;s close). I also suspect to hear about voter intimidation at the poles from ACORN/SEIU/Black Panther types, maybe even some violence. What will be the worst will be some people will justify the fraud and violence&#8230;.</p>
<p>Islam will change </p>

        <p>When people are angry, they strike out and the target is not always rational.</p>
<p>Believe me, people are angry. Everything &#8211; everything &#8211; these days is a sellout, from our money going to banks to the breathtaking reversal of &#8216;health care reform&#8217; into a policy of mandatory insurance.</p>
<p>Obama, unfortunately, deserves this.</p>

        <p><span>I voted this morning at 7:20am in Cambridge.  Unlike the presidential election there was no line to get a ballot. On my way out I maybe saw 1 or 2 people walking toward that building that looked liked people going to vote. Guess who I voted for.  <br /> <br />I used to be registered as an independent (and before that as a democrat). In a previous election I wanted to vote in the republican primary and had to declare myself a republican to do so. After that I never saw a good reason to switch back. A lot of the independents  Massachusetts were raised in democrat households so they are a little uncomfortable calling themselves a republicans. I think this bias means they are actually a little less independent then they way they&#8217;ve registered.  <br /> <br />I also think what appears as quirkiness is really a parochial or provincial attitude. In my opinion Massachusetts voted for George McGovern in 1972 because Nixon had challenged John F. Kennedy back in 1960. And in the same way many voted against Carter giving Reagan the state in 1980 because Carter defeated Teddy Kennedy in the primaries (I voted for Carter since I was not ready for Reagan at this point).  <br /> <br />A last point is that Massachusetts democrats have a lousy history of voting from Women for high office.</span></p>

        <p>If Mass votes for Brown, the admirer of Palin, the lover of Wall Street banks, the hater of medical care for all, and most of the rest of the rightwingnut agenda, you will know that mental derangement has occurred in the Bay State. Or that plutopropaganda is so powerful it can dupe almost anyone into obedience. Massachussets=Massadupedachussets.</p>

        <p>Rdan &#8211; Good to here that. I was hopeing the people of MA (my spelling also!) wouldn&#8217;t tolerate that crap.  Anyway&#8217;s it will be interesting. Eitehr way the fact that Brown is even in the running in such a blue state bodes ill for Dem chances in November.</p>

        <p>Thanks for explaining that the voters for Brown are not rational. I agree. On the other hand most of the rest of your post shows how expertly the plutocracy can bend brains to their will. Obama wants, for example, the banks to return the money to the public. Brown doesn&#8217;t. So how does Obama &#8220;deserve this&#8221;?</p>

        <p>see Buff</p>
<p>you do agree with me.</p>
<p>I was gonna say that people don&#8217;t appreciate the power of the Republican permanent campaign.</p>
<p>Or that the health care plan offends lots and lots of people whow would have liked a health care plan that did not have a requirement that they buy insurance from criminal corporations and pay a tax to pay for the poor people to be covered by those criminal corporations.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t know from Coakley.  But Obama is incompetent at meeting the Republican permanent campaign, and from where I sit he seems to be in the same pocket of the rich as the Repubs.</p>
<p>as for vote stealing,  that is a function of who is the local power.  don&#8217;t forget Ohio and Florida.</p>

<p>Buff changed his slogan after he got yelled at by us.  he had been saying that islam must change.</p>
<p>in my racist ignorance i agreed with him, but i knew i&#8217;d get killed by the racists on the other side (they call themselves pc) if i said so.</p>
<p>i don&#8217;t think Buff knows as much about islam as even i do (not much).   he is thinking about the terrorists, and the guys who throw acid in the face of women who go outside without their veils and a strong man to protect them.</p>
<p>i guess he is saying that islam will get tired of that.  my guess is that it will take them about another five centuries, just as it has taken Christians the last five centuries to achieve a degree of the Christianity as taught by Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>you can&#8217;t beat me in the &#8220;people are stupid&#8221; department.  but it is stupid to think that the people of Massachusetts aren&#8217;t trying to say something that is important to them.  i don&#8217;t know from Brown. I agree that Palin is stupid  (i like that word),  but i don&#8217;t think you can assume the people voting for the Republican know all that much about his &#8220;policies&#8221; or really care&#8230; they all lie anyway.  They are voting against an incredibly inept Democrat show in Washington.   The Dems appear to me to be inept because they are sold out to the same people the Repubs are sold out to.</p>
<p>when you see propaganda succeeding, it would be &#8220;not stupid&#8221; of you to look at the why of it, and not just comfort yourself with smug observations of the stupidity of the electorate.  from what i have seen stupidity is an equal opportunity employer of both sides.</p>

        <p>If Brown wins, it will be very hard to interpret the results as NOT a repudiation of Obama.  I mean this is MA, the bluest of the blue &#8211; I would have assumed the D&#8217;s could win with virtually anyone.  And if 0 is too far left for MA, imagine how the rest of the country feels.</p>

        <p>Well, my personal opinion is that this is a great attempt by the media to make a completely lack-luster election into something marketable. It&#8217;s also an attempt by outside money to get some points in for the Republican party.</p>
<p>I seem to remember this same sort of spin on the Boston mayoral campaign, and it ended up not even being close. From the ground, and locally, I can tell you a couple of things: my family wasn&#8217;t going to vote. They are now and they&#8217;re expressly going to vote for Martha. They&#8217;re REGISTERED Republicans too and always have been. After the Bush fiasco and the whole Palin thing, they&#8217;re done with the party. So read that anyway you want. Also most of my friends weren&#8217;t going to vote, and are going out now. They&#8217;re also voting Democratic.</p>
<p>So in the end, I think the same thing is going to happen here: a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing. As just as a point of disclosure, I&#8217;m going out to vote too and I wasn&#8217;t going to. I&#8217;m also a registered Republican and I&#8217;m voting for Coakley after discussing the race with friends and family.</p>

        <p>Buff, stop feeding the trolls!  But, I do agree with your analysis.  Some folks are just incapable of accepting thought providing alternative views than their own.</p>
<p>Dal, stupid is a pejorative term most often unsupported by evidence, and almost always wrong.  Ignorance, however, is almost always a better term, and more often supported by the individual&#8217;s commentary.</p>
<p>MM shows sign of both afflictions, closed minded and unable to accept any alternatives, and ignorance bordering on stupidity (because of the breadth of the ignorance.)</p>

        <p>MA voted for Hillary in the primaries (not me&#8230;).</p>
<p>Coakley is IMHO a very bad candidate.  I had a degree of trouble deciding in the primary because it was clear that Coakley was the anointed-one.  There was an air-of-inevitability about her that doesn&#8217;t play well here (Northern New England) for the most part.  That might have been why Hillary won here, actually.</p>
<p>Ultimately I voted for Capuano because I felt like we needed someone with some fire in the job.  Coakley seems to let other people do her talking for her, and the things they say don&#8217;t always seem to be well-informed when they aren&#8217;t straight-up callous.  Even when you&#8217;re telling the factual truth, you have to have some consideration for the audience (a hard lesson that I&#8217;m still learning).</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a machine-region the way that Chicago or Philadelphia have been known.  Menino has his cult-following (god only knows why, I think he&#8217;s getting the same kind of old-people vote that the Kennedys used to get&#8230;kiss enough babies and you can do whatever you want.)</p>
<p>Brown&#8217;s spokeswoman on the other hand comes off as a complete off-her-rocker lunatic.  She&#8217;s obviously a true believer and loves to spin for the sake of spinning, which I find repulsive, but that sort of attitude resonates with the Fox News crowd (there are a lot of them here, my parents literally leave the television tuned to Fox News all day, and it just poisons your mind, you hear the same insane crap over and over and eventually you believe it).</p>
<p>I think that Kennedy (libertarian of sorts) might end up with a fair sized vote based on his mistaken-name-ID.  Brown is going to have really big suburban numbers particularly in the north shore and south shore.  Worcester will go hard to Coakley (that&#8217;s a REAL machine-town).  I think that the urban vote will go Coakley for the most part, with a lot of people just holding their nose and filling in the oval for Coakley because Brown and Kennedy are so much worse.</p>
<p>One can only hope.</p>
<p>And the national health insurance reform has little in common with the system in Massachusetts as I understand it.  The reform process here was open and transparent by comparison (and it wasn&#8217;t).  There&#8217;s way more distrust because the Republicans have managed to spin insurance reform as a reform of healthcare delivery.  The stimulus plan did more to change the way that healthcare will be delivered in this country than the insurance bill will.</p>
<p>I just have a really bad feeling about this in general.  This might be a classic case of the winner in the primary being acceptable to a majority of the people willing to declare themselves Democrat and just being totally unacceptable as a personality on a wider basis.  Meanwhile you&#8217;ve got Brown standing next to his pickup truck playing up his military background (which is absolutely ridiculous, since when does that play here? 1956 when Eisenhower carried the entire state (except Boston&#8230;weird)?</p>
<p>In fact this election seems to have a lot in common with that one.  Eisenhower was standing by the fear vote with McCarthy (at least implicitly), and so is Brown.  This election could end up the same way, Brown pulling every suburban and rural district and the more urban districts going Coakley&#8230;(Boston, Worcester, Lowell, Lynn, maybe Brockton).</p>
<p>If Republicans get this seat, it will clearly all be Coakley&#8217;s fault.</p>

        <p>The &#8216;primary&#8217; was a dismal affair between the four democratic candidates, and made little news even here.  Neither did the campaign till now.  Turn out will clinch the deal probably. </p>

        <p>Well when people just lash out and vote stupidly, it is hardly something to be proud of. The fact that Brown voters would vote for him with his record makes it clear I think how easy it is to dupe them. They have little idea of what they are doing. Easy dupes.</p>

        <p>What the &#8220;terrorists&#8221; are doing is precisely what the Vietnamese, the Africans, the Indians, the Indonesians, and other colonial peoples did earlier. They fought to free themselves from colonial domination. The US, UK and Israel have been colonizing and trying to dominate the Muslim world now for decades and the victims are fighting back. Did the Vietnamese, the Africans, the Indians, etc., give up? NO, they kept at it until they got the Western colonizers OUT and so will the Muslims. &#8220;Terror&#8221; people seem not to understand is simply a method of war. You can fight against &#8220;terror&#8221; any more than you can fight against dive bombing. It is however a convenient red herring of a term to cover up and disguise what is going on. If people realized this was a neo-colonial war of liberation they would  probably stop and have doubts about its validity. But by using this red herring term the warmongers/neo-colonialists can obfuscate the situation and suck people into supporting them.</p>

        <p>PS I&#8217;d  be very responsive to intelligent arguments. I haven&#8217;t found any from buffy at all. He has a mind twisted by the propaganda of the ruling class (plutocracy and their rightwingnut dupes). Why should I &#8220;accept&#8221; his nonsense?</p>

        <p>If Brown wins it would be an endorsement of Wall Street bankers and their exemption from responsibility for what they have done, it would be an endorsement of keeping the lower classes from getting affordable medical insurance, and it would be an endorsement of other politicians like Palin. Is that what Mass. voters want? If so, let them screw themselves. They would have only themselves to blame. But (PS) the evil effects would spread out to the rest of the nation since his election would probably stop any shred of decent health care reform, and would probably make Wall Street even more arrogant, irresponsible and nose-thumbing toward the nation at large. So it is a crucial election.</p>

        <p>Obama&#8217;s not nearly left enough in my view.  Part of that has to do with the fact that he&#8217;s the president, and therefore shouldn&#8217;t act in an extremely partisan manner, and part of it has to do with the political reality of having a caucus that includes people who don&#8217;t belong in it who will hold up legislation on the foundational issues of his agenda (Lieberman, I&#8217;m staring at you and wishing that my eyes were lasers that would strike you down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger).</p>
<p>In any case, it is what it is.  The reactionary vote against Obama isn&#8217;t to vote for looney Republicans (this guy isn&#8217;t even a centrist Republican like the Republicans who held the governor&#8217;s office during the past couple decades) or total whackjob libertarians (who are at least ideologically pure, I just don&#8217;t agree with anything they say or do).</p>

        <p>JGoodwin<br />Excellent comment. Helps people like me lost in a sea of Red to understand the politics of a supposedly true Blue state. Good to see, though, that people in MA understand that their votes are important and that they do not hesitate to let their elected reps know it.  NO </p>

        <p>When Kennedy learned he was dying he could have stepped aside at a time advantageous to choosing a successor, but apparently the ego wouldn;t let that happen. This seems common in the Senate.</p>

        <p>There is an article (link on Economist&#8217;s View) in which the author posits that &#8220;terrorism&#8221; could be solved with social benefits: giving them SS and health care, etc., etc. It is written by an &#8220;intelligent&#8221; person but it is nonsense, sadly enough. A U of Chicago professor, whose name I don&#8217;t presently recall, made a very detailed study of terrorist activity and concluded that in EVERY case it comes from anger at intruders trampling over the terrorists&#8217; territory. It is a territorial struggle, as were the movements of colonial liberation. Get the intruders OUT. It is quite simple, but so simple many either can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to understand it. It applies to us in spades. Americans don&#8217;t seem to understand that they (and their Israeli darlings) are trampling on Musllim territory. The Muslims want us OUT. So simple, so difficult to grasp.</p>

        <p>I have a somewhat different idea why he is not &#8220;left enough&#8221; [about which I agree with you]. My take is that he knows he is &#8220;on approval&#8221; as the first black President, know that intense racism still lurks just beneath the surface of US politics, and that as a result he must not be conventionally &#8220;black&#8221; (ie radical) but act as if he were just another white middle of the road guy. He&#8217;s trying in short to be a Democrat Colin Powell, black but not scary, an &#8220;establishment&#8221; black who is friendly to Wall Street (up to a point) and who tried to soothe and placate even the loony Right.</p>

        <p>Well Coakley may not be an ideal candidate, but one has to put her in context. It&#8217;s either she or Brown. In spite of all her faults I would think sensible people would prefer her to Brown. One is a rightwingnut, the other a flawed liberal. Trashing Coakley in this situation seems to me to be not the right thing to do.</p>

<p>Yea &#8211; Your right I&#8217;ll stop feeding the troll.  I think I hit you up on that the other day&#8230;my turn.</p>
<p>I still expect Coakley to win.  Mostly becuase of machine politics.  Can&#8217;t wait to see ballets being &#8216;found&#8217;.  But it really doesn&#8217;t matter.  The message has been sent and every blue dog Dem in the house will be wondering if he has less than a year left in his political career.  Heck, Sen Reid is not expected to survive even with the disarray the Nevada GOP is in.  The fact that Obama had to come up to MA showed just how devastating the backlash has become. </p>

        <p><span>Rdan, <br /> <br />The point of making a spreasheet is to enhance transparency. The social security administration had someone make their own tool using a proprietary software but in my opinion is not usable. <br /> <br />On vetting, the first step would be to reproduce what the social security administration uses as their base case.</span></p>

        <p>Coberly,</p>
<p><em>as for vote stealing,  that is a function of who is the local power.  don&#8217;t forget Ohio and Florida.</em><br /><em></em><br />Yes, I remember that after the initial count Bush was ahead in both states. In Florida the democrat from Chicago tried to bring a little bit of Illinois to the sunshine state but came up short. If you can&#8217;t steal an election with a name like Daley I don&#8217;t think you were meant to win.</p>

<p>because I say so.</p>
<p>I disagree with Buff more often than I agree with him, at least in public.  i don&#8217;t see that he has said anything unreasonable here (that i noticed).  you on the other hand are giving us a text book example.  and i agree with you.</p>

<p>Sammy is wrong that it is a repudiation of Obama being too far left.  It is a repudiation of Obama being too far right to offer an honest health plan,  the voters, as you point out, are too stupid to uderstand that.  they are just mad about the health plan and they blame the democrats&#8230; as they should.  but they don&#8217;t know the democrats are too far right to be honest or rational.</p>
<p>you and they are making the same mistake  Democrat = good  Republican = bad  in your case.  In theirs it is just the opposite, that is, just the same.</p>

<p>Three of the last five lieutenant governors were women. And Coakley herself was elected state-wide. Is that really out of line with other states?</p>

        <p>Rdan,</p>
<p>According to the press over 100K absentee ballots are out there.  Any bets they fall heavily for Coakley? I will go on record and even predict they go AT LEAST 80% for Coakley.  From reading around Brown probably has to win by 5-6% to overcome expected voter fraud, maybe more. </p>
<p>I expect Coakley to win in a close one purely on voter fraud. There is just no way the Dems will let a Rep in the People&#8217;s Seat&#8230;.</p>

<p>The Schilling thing was an attempt at a joke. It not only fell flat but backfired badly. But I really really doubt that Coakley doesn&#8217;t know who Schilling is particularly since he is politically very active.</p>

        <p>MA isn&#8217;t the only Blue state like that.  Illinois is similar, with suburban Chicago and downstate leaning right to heavily right, and the more traditional urban areas and college towns leaning more to the left.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t speak to other places in the country (haven&#8217;t lived there).</p>
<p>The view from Boston is often that if it doesn&#8217;t happen inside the 128/95/93 belt, then it didn&#8217;t happen and isn&#8217;t important, and the rest of the state resents it.  Meanwhile you have the suburbanite aspirational plutocrats buying into the American Dream bullshit on a daily basis.</p>

        <p>Cantab at a minimum I will promise to put up anything on Social Security you like over at the Bruce Webb which would allow you to link to it in comments here.</p>
<p>And Coberly is working from Social Security numbers and in fact took the trouble to put the Current Law numbers into spreadsheets to serve as a base for the ones used in the plan:<br />OASDI 2009 Current Law: http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rjyg2yaQ_6kj_AAXoLsA0sQ<br />OASI 2009 Current Law: http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rCwPA-HCtmqSGy6neoFNhuw<br />DI 2009 Current Law: http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rckNH41TQyi31ucuLmJ7jlg</p>
<p>If it became necessary we could supply them in .xls or .cwk format.</p>
<p>But a warning you have a habit of reading the SS Report too narrowly. Just because the Trustees use the word &#8220;immediately&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t mean that is the only workable alternative. What the Trustees are doing in the summary is presenting the outside choices: immediate increase in taxes to deliver 100% of scheduled benefit, immediate cut in benefits to restore actuarial balance, ultimate increase in taxes  to deliver 100% benefit if TF is allowed to go to depletion, ultimate cut in benefits if TF is allowed to go to depletion and no fix imposed. That is why it is called a summary. Which is also why it doesn&#8217;t mention the range of economic and demographic outcomes that would change those numbers and dates. In order to understand how the fix could be modified you need to examine the tables which break everything down by year or sub-period. For example this table shows you that the actual actuarial imbalance for the first 25 year sub-period is just 0.17% of payroll. While the total imbalance over the first 50 years is 1.51%. Which is why implementing an initial 0.3% fix allows one to delay to 2026 the start of a more comprehensive fix that puts the whole system back on a PayGo basis over the whole span of years and not just as an aggregate as the immediate 2.01% would do.<br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2009/VI_OASDHI_payroll.html#131183" rel="nofollow">http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2009/VI_OASDHI_payroll.html#131183</a></p>
<p>But really you need to do more than cut, paste and underline from the summary as if Dale and I just overlooked those passages. We didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>But yes I&#8217;ll cross-post anything you like at my site and do the vetting and deconstructing post-facto.</p>

        <p>Rdan and all,</p>
<p>I got the comment below from Megan McArdles site at the Atlantic from a poster named &#8216;blighter&#8217;.  Its really performance art at its finest and everyone should find the humor in this over-the-top irony/sarcasm etc.  Heck I read Megan&#8217;s blog alf the time just for blighter&#8217;s comments.</p>
<p><span>blighter </span><a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2010/01/both_sides_now.php#comment-365826" rel="nofollow">January 19, 2010 11:34 AM</a></p>
<p>Megan writes: &#8220;But if you want to rage, rage against the universe that provides us too little information, and too limited brains, to make perfect choices every time.&#8221;<br />You see, here again you prove that it is in fact <i>you</i> who needs to &#8220;get out more&#8221;. Have you never met a progressive technocrat? They have, if anything, too much information, too huge of brains and make if not perfect choices every time, then certainly very good choices and far better than the teeming unwashed masses make for themselves. The reason it&#8217;s easy to hate people who oppose having compassionate progressive geniuses re-order society from top-to-bottom (well, let&#8217;s be honest, from bottom-to-middle. The top is already largely populated by the progressive elite and thus can probably just keep-on keepin&#8217; on&#8230;) is because people who oppose progress are <i>indisputably</i> evil.<br />So, supporting politicians who will oppose Obama et al&#8217;s efforts to usher in a new golden age, one that this time will benefit the poor, the hungry, the ill, children, puppy dogs with droopy eyes and everyone else who suffered terribly under George W. Bush&#8217;s reign of terror is also indisputably evil. The thing is, though, that most of the left is far too kind. They make excuses for these idiot voters, they say, &#8220;it&#8217;s not their fault, the Republicans have tricked them. We must still be compassionate and respectful of their opinion and right to express it.&#8221;<br />Happily, more and more progressives are realizing that kind of hogwash is a road to nowhere. What we need is less participation by the bigoted, barbaric masses and more firm leadership by the enlighened elite. After the world has been made better, everyone will be a progressive and there will be no opposition, but until then it&#8217;s probably best if we ignore or repress the hatefully atavistic &#8216;conservative&#8217; half of the population. It is clearly in the best interests of everyone, even the hateful haters themselves.<br />Lastly, I have to disagree with you, Megan, here:&#8221;Life is too short for me to spend any time manufacturing hatred for strangers.&#8221;<br />Proving that you are a better, more moral person than others by hating people who refuse to see the clear wisdom of your preferred policy &#038; lifestyle choices is among the most satisfying experiences in life. It&#8217;s why I go on about how much more refined my food-choices are &#8212; and more moral too as I avoid the gruel that the common brute slops up from factory farming. It&#8217;s why I spend so much time preening about how much more I care for the downtrodden as evinced by my earnestly expressed desire for the government to spend lots of other people&#8217;s money on them. It&#8217;s why I go on and on about how oppressed are various groups like gay people, polyamorous people, short people, tall people, handi-capable people, and so on.<br />But then the brutish commoners have to come along with their ignorant support of &#8220;freedom&#8221; and other euphemisms for hatred and spoil everything with their infernal &#8220;right to vote&#8221;. That&#8217;s the biggest problem facing us right now.<br />Hopefully this &#8216;election&#8217; will be the wake-up call our progressive leaders need to stop their dilly-dallying and cram through as much goodness and light as they possible before the evil bigots claw their way to any more of a toe-hold of power. Barring that, I think we&#8217;ll have to [&#8230;]</p>

        <p><span>&#8220;I also suspect to hear about voter intimidation at the poles from ACORN/SEIU/Black Panther types, maybe even some violence. What will be the worst will be some people will justify the fraud and violence&#8230;.  &#8220;</span></p>
<p>Yeah I suspect you will hear about that too. The only problem is that all of that turned out to be mythical. There was one guy in Panther regalia. They made him go away. One guy slipped and fell while sparring with some SEIU guys, showed up the next day in a wheelchair (even though video showed him jumping right up) and for a few days you couldn&#8217;t turn on Fox without seeing Gladney. But nothing came of it because there was beating of poor Rodney Gladney. It was all a sham. And Acorn has been cleared of any vote rigging or registration fraud and the video &#8216;documenting&#8217; Acorn workers given tax advice to a pimp and a hooker turns out to have been heavily edited after the fact with a whole new soundtrack.</p>
<p>But of course Fox is better at spreading misinformation than correcting it, some people still kneejerk to &#8216;panther, SEIU, Acorn&#8217;.</p>

        <p>Or maybe we are thinking too narrowly.  Bad economic performance usually costs the incumbent party. The whole bailout thing remains unpopular.  No need for this to be a reflection of just the health care deal.  In fact, we may be substituting consequences for causes.  It is pretty well understood that a GOP win will put the health care bill at risk.  The doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the vote is more &#8220;about&#8221; health care than other issues.</p>

        <p>JG, C&#8217;mon man, the whole country is like that.  Urban = more liberal and more Dem voters.  Rural = more conservative and more Repub voters.  As more move to the major cities the national elections are being controlled by a handful of urban areas.  From your comment, I assume you live within the boundaries you described.</p>
<p>As to who wins/loses in this election, if Coakley wins pundits and pollsters lose, big time.  Many Dems breathe a sigh of relief, and the administration gets on with its agenda.</p>
<p>If Brown wins, the many Dems begin running in earnest tomorrow or reconsider running at all.  The administration rethinks its current agenda and implementing strategy.</p>
<p>Of the 30 Senators up for election, ten are in tossup districts (6Ds &#038; 4Rs),  if Brown wins it is possible to see all the tossup districts go conservative, plus possibly a handfull of the remaining twenty.  That means Dems lose the Senate. </p>
<p>Current estimates are for as high as 28 House seats going conservative.  If the same trend as the Senate continues then the 28 seats will be a low estimate, and the Dems lose the House.</p>
<p>What I find intriguing is how insulated are the liberals from the depth and breadth of political feeling in the country.  MM is the poster child representing this.  It may be the case as JG said, that outside their immediate locales nothing else exists.</p>

        <p>Bruce &#8211; I never meant to imply these two never did anything while in office.  Heck Kennedy&#8217;s sponsership of NCLB was a leading reason it got passed.  BUt there comes a time when these guys should resign rather than being rolled out on a gurney.  Kennedy stayed to long as has Byrd. I am in favor of term limits just to turn over the power more often.</p>

        <p>For the GOP, it works when it&#8217;s Florida or Ohio.  Democrats really need to get better at cheating to be competitive.</p>

        <p>Scott Brown&#8217;s position is that he supports the Massachusetts health care reforms but opposes the current Federal bill. Given the analyses I&#8217;ve seen that state that the current bill is more or less the same as the Massachusetts law, scaled up to the rest of the country, I&#8217;d like to see how he distinguishes between them. I haven&#8217;t seen anything from him on that subject.</p>

<p>Basically they are saying the voters are too dumb to tell the candidates apart. May be true.</p>

        <p>I think the problems with the Mass health care plan magnify the issue as well.</p>
