                                <p>&#8230;I would not be likely to find them.  But at least I know how to look. Start at the macro level and see if there is a noticeable shift in revenues:

<div>I decided that anything that didn&#8217;t have at least a 0.3% change in its effect on GDP over three years could not be defined as a Structural Change, especially by the people who claim <i>a priori </i>that the change is structural. This may be giving them too much credit, but that&#8217;s how we roll here in Dataland.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are two basic areas that show effectively neutral shifts. The first is that there is a decline in Construction that is matched by a rise in Manufacturing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If we look at employment in Construction, it peaks (as one might expect) in April of 2006. (Employment in Manufacturing in the United States peaked in June of 1979.)  </div>
<div></div>
<div>If we normalize both Construction and Manufacturing to that peak, we might expect that Manufacturing hiring would increase while Construction hiring would decrease. (Indeed, having chosen the maximum point in Construction Employment to be early in the graphic, the general trend in Construction becomes inevitable.)</div>
<div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UMopT4p17YI/T6_kXkREXxI/AAAAAAAAA-U/6LRtY5iS4dU/s1600/C&#038;MNornalizedtoConsPeak.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UMopT4p17YI/T6_kXkREXxI/AAAAAAAAA-U/6LRtY5iS4dU/s320/C&#038;MNornalizedtoConsPeak.PNG" width="320"></a></div>
</div>
<div>As expected (by definition, as it were), Construction plummeted, and now appears to have &#8220;leveled off&#8221; in the range of a 25-30% decline from its peak. But Manufacturing, even as it represents the shifted share-of-GDP also plummeted and has &#8220;recovered&#8221; only to about a 15% decline since the same point.  So let&#8217;s see if we can see the shift if we measure employment in the two areas using the NBER-designated &#8220;trough&#8221; of June 2009 as our baseline.  Then we have:</div>
<div>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0URCG4GUNAU/T6_jhDFHZGI/AAAAAAAAA-M/A0Wz3YeL7oM/s1600/C&#038;MNormalizedtoRecessionEnd.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0URCG4GUNAU/T6_jhDFHZGI/AAAAAAAAA-M/A0Wz3YeL7oM/s320/C&#038;MNormalizedtoRecessionEnd.PNG" width="320"></a></div>
<p></div>
<div></div>
<div>What we see here is that, while there has been a GDP ratio shift, there is not a notable <i>hiring </i>trend&#8211;an increase of less than 2% in nearly three years&#8211;certainly not enough of a trend (even adjusting for the difference in employment totals) that we can say that there is unsatisfied demand in the Manufacturing sector.  And that is from a &#8220;<i>trough</i>&#8221; in the economic cycle.</p>
<p>Looking solely at the net change in employment between the two sectors <i>since the Recession ended</i> makes it clear that there is a lack of <i>demand</i>, not supply:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;with long-term government borrowing as cheap as in living memory, with unemployed workers and plenty of spare capacity and&#8230;suffering from both creaking infrastructure and a chronic lack of housing supply, now is the time for government to borrow and invest.  This is not just basic macroeconomics, it is common sense.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/10/news/economy/romney-defense-spending/index.htm">Charles Riley</a> of CNNMoney has a must see graph showing how defense spending under Mitt Romney would compare to the current DOD baseline budget over the next decade. His title notes the spending over the next decade will exceed the baseline budget by more than $2 trillion. I like this: <br />
<blockquote>Romney has proposed a slew of tax cuts, and plans to cap federal spending at 20% of GDP. But in both cases, the Romney campaign hasn&#8217;t fully explained how those provisions will be paid for. The lack of detail means that Romney&#8217;s claim of moving toward a balanced budget requires a great deal of trust.</p></blockquote>
<p>But no one should trust Mitt Romney on fiscal matters. No one.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/us-inequality-is-getting-worse.html">US inequality is getting worse</a></p>
<p>The Congressional REsearch Service released a report in March showing that US inequality is getting worse. Linda Levine, <a href="http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/R42400_20120307.pdf">US income distribution and mobility: trends and international comparisons</a>, Congressional Research Service (Mar. 7, 2012).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an excerpt from the summary provided in the report itself.</p>
<blockquote><p>Approaching three years into the recovery from the 2007-2009 recession, the unemployment rate remains over 8%. The persistent difficulty of many of the workers who lost jobs to find reemployment has meant reduced incomes for them and their families. A historically slow rebound in the labor market appears to be partly responsible for some groups’ focus on the distribution of the benefits of economic growth and for some policymakers’ interest in redistributing income through the tax code, for example. Varying perceptions about a trade-off between economic growth and income equality appear to underlie longstanding congressional deliberations about such policy issues as the progressivity of income tax rates, the tax treatment of capital gains, and the adjustment of the federal minimum wage. If income were equally divided across households, each quintile (fifth) would account for 20% of total income. The Congressional Budget Office and others have documented that the bottom fifth has long accounted for much less than 20% of total income. The bottom quintile’s share of income has remained little changed for the past few decades at less than 4%, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. In contrast, the income shares of the top fifth and the top 5% of households appear to have trended upward. The top fifth’s share of total household income rose from 42.6% in 1968 to 50.2% in 2010; the top 5%’s share, from 16.3% to 21.3%. (Estimates derived from      <br />federal income tax data suggest that those at the very top of the income distribution have experienced greater gains.) The middle class, defined as the middle 60%, received a       <br />disproportionately smaller share of the total economic pie in 2010 (46.5%) than in 1968 (53.2%).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />***<br />Based on the limited data that are comparable across nations, the U.S. income distribution appears to be among the most uneven of all major industrialized countries and the United States appears to be among the nations experiencing the greatest increases in measures of inequality. Three leading explanations are put forth for these cross-country differences: (1) other advanced economies devote a larger share of national output to transfers, which tends to equalize income across households; (2) the progressivity of tax rates varies by country and thus has different effects on the distribution of after-tax income; and (3) equality in the distribution of earnings,      <br />which account for most household income, varies substantially across countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Inequality is increasing and mobility in the US economy is diminishing, as the rich get richer and the middle class gets poorer and the poor stay poor. Because so many Americans have believed the hype about &#8220;free markets&#8221; pushed by the right and the Chicago School economic perspective, they don&#8217;t understand the failures of the &#8220;free market&#8221; theory &#8211;for example, that it cannot accurately predict much of anything about the economy,and that its policy dictates are likely to be total failures since they are based on assumptions that simply don&#8217;t hold for actual societies (like infinite lifetimes, 100% consumption of incomes, a unitary preference and other nonsense). </p>
<p>They echo the radical right&#8217;s rhetoric antagonistic to redistribution in favor of those who are disadvantaged by the growing inequality, and blithely miss the way tax policy and spending policy redistributes upwards in ways that contributes to the increase in inequality. Americans are also lulled into complacency about the harm of increasing inequality by the American myth that everybody that has the will to take the risks can be a self-made millionaire. Thus, they miss any opportunities to force Congress to bring the oligarchy under control through wiser tax policy and legislative initiatives focused on addressing genuine public needs through democratic egalitarianism.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/05/11/tuition_is_too_damn_high/singleton/" target="_blank">Salon</a> points us to a primary reason public higher education tuition inflation has occurred that is left out of election rhetoric, more so than the suggested availability of Pell grants.  And of course the selling of the need for one by us all.   </p>
<blockquote><p>The problem: The word “public” doesn’t mean as much as it used to. Direct state support for public colleges has cratered over the past 10 years, and really fell off the cliff after the financial crisis. Yes, tuitions have risen, but not by as much as state and local appropriations for higher education have fallen. Just between 2008 and 2009, for example, average tuition revenue at public research institutions increased by $369 per student, but the loss in state and local appropriations per student was $751. Similarly, at public community colleges, tuition revenue rose by $113 per student, while appropriations fell by $488. Since the recession of 2001, tuition hikes, as exorbitant as they have been, still haven’t kept pace with the fall in government support.   </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The bottom line: For the large majority of college students, rising tuitions have nothing to do with the availability of student loans or Pell Grants. What’s happening, instead, is that the burden of paying for college that was previously provided directly by government has now been shifted onto the backs of students&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Leigh McIlvaine at <a href="http://clawback.org/2012/05/10/colorado-governor-doesnt-buy-sales-tax-giveaway/">Clawback</a> reports that Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper has vetoed SB 124, a bill that would have expanded the use of sales tax for tax increment financing of tourist projects under the Regional Tourism Act. While subsidy reformers in the state have so far been able to defeat sales tax TIF at the local level (unlike, for example, Missouri), the Regional Tourism Act allows this at the state level, but only for two projects per year expected to bring in tourists from out of state &#8212; not that interstate sales tax competition is such a great use of subsidy dollars anyway.<br />    <br />The bill would have made it possible to approve six projects in a single year. This would weaken oversight of the program since all the projects would have been approved at one time. As McIlvaine points out, the bill was especially controversial because Gaylord Entertainment in Aurora (near Denver International Airport), already heavily subsidized, had applied to receive a further subsidy through the Regional Tourism Act. Gaylord has already lured a major convention, the Western Stock Show, to relocate from Denver.    </p>

<p><a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/10/update-100-million-incentives-us-25-eu.html">Gaylord</a>, already in the top 25 subsidies in the U.S. since 2000 (a revised version of my paper on this is almost ready to go back to the journal) at $300 million, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2012/05/03/gaylord-exec-no-go-for-aurora.html?page=all">is demanding</a> that the state provide the full $85.4 million it has requested under the Regional Tourism Act or the $824 million project will not be built at all. This represents a nominal aid intensity of 46.8% of the investment and, according to <i>Denver Business Journal</i>, is more than twice as high a subsidy as Gaylord has ever received. The Colorado Economic Development Commission must make a decision on this and five other applications for the two awards on May 18.<br />     <br />The Governor&#8217;s veto ensures that only two projects can be approved this year and allows him to &#8220;keep limits on the on the new tax-incentive program before the state committed too much money on an annual basis to tourism projects,&#8221; as the <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/capitol_business/2012/05/kerr-harvey-proud-of-their-veto-pens.html"><i>Denver Business Journal</i></a> said Tuesday. The story notes that the bill only passed the House of Representatives by a 37-27 vote. This guarantees that the veto will not be overridden.<br />     <br />Though it was a bad move to approve state sales tax TIF at all, Hickenlooper&#8217;s veto prevents it from becoming a worse problem and slows the likely push to increase total subsidies under the program and weaken the targeting inherent in authorizing only two projects per year. For this, he is to be commended.   crossposted with <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/05/colorado-governor-hickenlooper-vetoes.html" target="_blank">Middle Class Political Economist</a></p>

<p>The worm in Apple (and the US tax code)&#8211;offshoring of US Profits</p>
<p>Citizens for Tax Justice has focused on Apple&#8217;s ability to lower its US effective tax rate by offshoring its profits to tax havens.  See, e.g.,  Robert McIntyre, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/04/opinion/what-apple-pays-in-taxes-and-doesnt.html">What Apple Pays in Taxes and Doesn&#8217;t</a>, NY Times Letters to the Editor, CTJ, <a href="http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2012/05/how_to_end_apples_offshore_tax_shenanigans.php">How to end Apple&#8217;s offshore shenanigans</a>, May 4, 2012;   [hat tip Paul Caron at Tax Prof].  Here&#8217;s the key idea in both the letter and the report.<br />
<blockquote>Since Apple’s profits stem mainly from its U.S.-created technology, most, if not all, of these untaxed profits are almost certainly United States profits that Apple has artificially shifted offshore.<br />If we treat all of the untaxed portion of Apple’s offshore profits as really U.S. profits that were artificially shifted to offshore tax havens, then Apple’s U.S. tax rate is much lower than Apple reports. Under this approach, Apple’s 2008-10 effective federal tax rate comes to only 13.4%, and its effective federal tax rate over the last six years (2006-11) was only 12.1%. (Likewise, Apple’s revised effective state tax rate in 2008-10 was only 3.6%, instead of the 8.0% we reported in our state corporate tax study issued last December.)  CTJ report.</p></blockquote>
<p>How does CTJ know that Apple parks its profits offshore in tax havens where they are subject to minimal taxes?<br />
<blockquote>Apple says that if it told its foreign subsidiaries to pay Apple the whole $54 billion offshore amount as a dividend, then Apple would owe $17 billion in U.S. federal income taxes. That reflects a $19 billion tax at 35 percent, less a $2 billion foreign tax credit (the sum of all the foreign income taxes that Apple has ever paid). Which means, with a little more arithmetic, that about 90 percent of the $54 billion in accumulated offshore profits has never been taxed by any government.  Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a genuine problem for the US in the age of digitized information.  Companies easily &#8220;sell&#8221; their most important intellectual property to offshore affiliates, for prices that are set by modeling and that fail to capture the obvious&#8211;that no price would actually be sufficient to purchase the company&#8217;s valuable intellectual property away from it, since the IP is in fact the basis for the company&#8217;s business.  So companies offshore their profits to post-office boxes in tax haven countries and claim that the US Is no longer the source of their profits, even though the IP was invented in the US, is still used in the US and still results in most of the sales actually in the US.</p>
<p>There are at least two possible solutions.  One would be to deny companies the ability to treat the IP they use to create their products as sold for tax purposes, and to permit only licensing for royalties to actual factories in countries that are not tax havens. Another would be to end the deferral on &#8220;active business&#8221; profits offshore.  It makes no sense because it incentivizes companies to offshore as much of their business as possible.</p>

<p>Presidents, Congress, and Economic Growth &#8211; The Return of Presimetrics</p>
<p>   If you&#8217;re a regular reader, you may know that a couple of years ago, Michael Kanell of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and I had a book published called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Facts-Presidents-Measure-Issues/dp/B005HKSK8M/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0">Presimetrics</a>.   Nobody much read the book, but we had a lot of fun writing it.   In it we looked at how Presidents performed on a wide variety of issues &#8211; everything from curbing abortions to the murder rate to the national debt.  We tried to be as objective as possible, always using data from whichever source collected it, and treating each variable the same way.</p>
<p>Thus, for instance, when looking at the murder rate &#8211; we collected data from the FBI.  Then we measured the change in the murder rate from right before a President took office to right before a President left office.  We found that on a number of issues, particularly economic ones, Presidents who did well followed similar policies to other Presidents who did well.  Conversely, Presidents who did poorly on a given issue tended to either show it not much attention or follow the same approach to the issue as other Presidents who did poorly.  That is to say, policies matter.</p>
<p>In this post I want to focus on economic growth, but I want to do something a bit different than what we did in the book, and a smidge more complicated than the graphical approach in Presimetrics.</p>
<p>In the book, we looked at the annualized change in real GDP per capita from before a President took office to right before he left office.  This time, I want to look at the following variable:  Annualized Growth rate over the next four years less Annualized Growth rate for the previous four years.</p>
<p>Thus, for, say, 1981, Reagan&#8217;s first year in office, that variable would have this formula:<br />
<blockquote>annualized growth rate from 1981 to 1985 less annualized growth rate from 1977 to 1981</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, it would show the difference in the growth rates between Reagan&#8217;s first four year term, and the four year term of his predecessor, Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>I went with four year periods because just about every President in the sample served at least one four year term (or most of at least one four year term), and four years is enough time to see if policies are working or not, on average.   <br /><a name="more"></a><br />The BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">data on real GDP</a> goes back to 1929, so the variable could be created for the years from 1933 to 2007.</p>
<p>I ran a regression attempting to explain this change in the growth rate using the following dummy variables:</p>
<p>1.  A Republican becomes President.  This variable took values of 1 in 1953 (the year Ike took office), 1969 (the year Nixon took office), 1975 (Ford actually took office in August of 1974, but I rounded up for Presidents who took over in the second half of the year), 1981 (Reagan), 1989 (Bush 1) and 2001 (Bush 2).  The variable took values of zero all other years.</p>
<p>2.  A Democrat becomes President.  This variable took values of 1 in 1933 (FDR&#8217;s first year), 1945 (Truman took office in April 1945), 1961 (JFK), 1964 (LBJ took office in November of 1963), 1977 (Carter) and 1993 (Clinton).</p>
<p> 3.  A Republican President begins his second term.  This variable took values of 1 in 1957 (Ike), 1973 (Nixon), 1985 (Reagan), and 2005 (Bush 2).</p>
<p>4.  A Democrat begins his second (or plus) term.  This variable took values of 1 in 1937 (FDR), 1941 (FDR), 1949 (Truman), 1965 (LBJ), and 1997 (Clinton).</p>
<p>5.  A sitting Republican Veep ascends to the Presidency.  This one takes values of 1 in 1975 and 1989.</p>
<p>6.  A sitting Democrat Veep ascends to the Presidency, which occurred in 1945 and 1964.</p>
<p>7.  Republicans take over both houses of Congress from Democrats.  That happened in 1947, 1953, and 1995.</p>
<p>8.  Democrats take over both houses of Congress from Republicans, which we saw in 1933, 1949, 1955 and 2007.</p>
<p>Note that variables 7 and 8 only count instances where one party took control of both houses of congress from the other party and not from a mixed Congress.  Some instances of mixed Congresses looked a bit like one party control so I decided to simply those out.</p>
<p>Obviously, the fit of this simple model won&#8217;t be that great as all the variables are dummy variables, and that&#8217;s the sort of thing that really doesn&#8217;t help your cause when it comes to patterns in the residuals, but hey, the goal here is not to explain the change in growth rates (I&#8217;ve done that before, and perhaps will follow up this post) but to look at which of these variables.</p>
<p>If, for example, a given party&#8217;s Presidents tend to enact policies that produce growth, we would expect to see the coefficient associated with that party&#8217;s presidents be positive and statistically significant.</p>
<p> Results of the regression are shown below.   </p>

<p>I could comment, but from past experience, I know that if I do, I&#8217;ll be excoriated by people insisting I&#8217;m a partisan.  So I highlighted the significant and almost significant variables, and I&#8217;m calling it a day.   Please leave your thoughts about what this means and why in the comments section.</p>
<p> Well, I guess there is one comment I do have to make as I wipe a touch of egg off my face&#8230; the coefficient (and quasi-significance) of the Democrat Veep ascendance variable kinda throws into question at least part of what I wrote <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/05/how-unpatriotic-are-us-presidents.html">here</a>.</p>
<p> And now, my usual closing statement:  if anyone wants my spreadsheet, just drop me a line.  I&#8217;m at: my first name (mike), my last name (kimel &#8211; one m only) at gmail.</p>

<blockquote>The key to the first question is US profit margins, which are still at or around record highs. At some point, logic suggests they will start reverting to the mean. And, aside from events in the eurozone and elsewhere, wringing out more productivity is a finite process. There is only so much juice in the lemon.   In the long run, lack of investment must surely take its toll. According to Smithers &#038; Co, official figures show the proportion of US domestic corporate cash flow devoted to capital investment at record lows of about 57 per cent. This compares with an average of 77 per cent over the past 60 years.   So where has the cash gone? To shareholders, mainly. In the second half of last year, dividends and buybacks by US corporations came to almost exactly the same as capital investment, at just over $2tn.   As recently as the early 1990s, spending on investment was four times the amount handed to shareholders. The ratio has been dropping steadily ever since&#8230;  &#8230;it is worth noting that even credit analysts these days tend to measure debt in relation to cash flow rather than assets. If corporate margins are indeed under threat, that is self-deluding.  &#8230;The money will have come from their own immense cash piles. But US companies still have net debt – after deducting that cash – equal to perhaps 40 per cent of their equity.</p></blockquote>

<p>The other day I was listening to a fascinating interview on US executions.<br /> "So far this year, 5 convicted criminals felt the executioner's<br />needle. Michael Graczyk watched as they took their last breath. The<br />reporter from the Associated Press has witnessed more than 300<br />executions. It's believed he's seen more men and women put to death<br />than anyone else in the United States."<br /> (Link is <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/episode/2012/05/03/execution-reporter-michael-graczyk/">here</a>. Audio  is <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/thecurrent/popupaudio.html?clipIds=2230340722">here</a>)</p>
<p>But what caught my ear was the moment in the interview when Graczyk<br />remarked that in 1982, Texas resumed executions.  I thought, there's<br />another entry for my file "It all started in 1980."</p>
<p>From 1964 to 1982, eighteen years, Texas executed nobody.</p>
<p>In 1964 the US Supreme Court negated all death penalties nationwide in<br />"Furman v. Georgia" due to unacceptable trial-and-sentencing<br />procedures.  (details <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Texas#History">here</a>, in case you care.)</tt><br /><tt></tt><br /><tt><a name="more"></a></tt></p>
<p><tt><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-noDPkhlPaTY/T6vqthlNvRI/AAAAAAAAA2Y/_mF_uFjKqyY/s1600/laughable_graph_%231.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="221" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-noDPkhlPaTY/T6vqthlNvRI/AAAAAAAAA2Y/_mF_uFjKqyY/s320/laughable_graph_%231.jpg" width="320"></a><br />States revised their trial procedures and by 1976 the Supremes allowed<br />that under these new procedures states could resume executions.  Yet<br />Texas didn't use this until 1982 (a single execution), and then things<br />took off.</p>
<p>However, this post has nothing to do with capital punishment, but with<br />the economy.  And I noticed something interesting.</p>
<p>See, all this led me to look at the number of Texas executions over<br />time.  In this very rough (don't laugh) graph,</p>
<p>there were three peaks in Texas executions -- in the late 1800s, in the 30s,<br />and today's.  Each peak has outdone the previous, and the 2000-2010<br />numbers were the highest ever.</p>
<p>For those who don't notice it, these eras equate to the Long Depression, the Great Depression, and our current depression.</p>
<p>Now, I realize that an element of the growth in executions is tied to<br />population growth, and if I had time I could chart that out.  However,<br />Texas population growth can be seen in this chart (<a href="http://www.lsjunction.com/texians/charta.gif">http://www.lsjunction.com/texians/charta.gif</a>), and is shown to be a<br />long smooth exponential rise since 1800.  Taking that into account,<br />there would still be three big bumps in the distribution of<br />executions.  In my second laughable graph, you can see executions<br />really take off in the late 90s, leading into the biggest decade ever<br />-- 2000-2010, 248 executions.</p>
<p>It certainly looks to me like America's deepest recession /<br />depressions, are linked to Texas executions in some way.  But<br />laughable graph #2</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-J7rZRhtxK3Q/T6vp3UGAVaI/AAAAAAAAA2Q/fkQFRYu4oIU/s1600/laughable_graph_%232.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-J7rZRhtxK3Q/T6vp3UGAVaI/AAAAAAAAA2Q/fkQFRYu4oIU/s320/laughable_graph_%232.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
<p>shows that the link is probablypredictive rather than resultant -- something is happening in the society which causes a buildup of personal disasters and/or punitive overreaction, before the bubble bursts.</p>
<p>If this is the case, then laughable graph #2 seems to show a dismally<br />hopeful trend, as execution rates have dropped since the housing and<br />finance bubbles burst in 2007-2008.</tt><br /><tt></tt></p>
