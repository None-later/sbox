<p> A kind person suggested I be ready to be crucified about calling for increasing a &#8220;regressive tax&#8221; if I call for raising the payroll tax  forty cents per week.</p>
<p>The people who say Social Security is a regressive tax are suffering from brain damage caused by parrot fever.  Having been taught to say &#8220;regressive tax, regressive tax&#8221; when they  were young and impressionable, they can&#8217;t stop themselves. They don&#8217;t  mean anything by it, but they think they do.</p>
<p>They don&#8217;t know what a regressive tax is.  They don&#8217;t know what a tax is.  They don&#8217;t know what regressive means.  And above all they have no sense of proportion.</p>
<p>The &#8220;tax&#8221; increase needed by Social Security is forty cents per week.  This is the cost to the average worker of saving a program  that will give them about twenty thousand dollars a year when they retire.  But the &#8220;liberals&#8221; call that forty cents a &#8220;regressive tax,  regressive tax&#8221; and would see the poor loose that twenty thousand  dollars in order to save forty cents worth of &#8220;regressive tax, regressive tax.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A regressive tax is a tax that falls more heavily on the poor than on the rich as a percent of income.  The usual case is a &#8220;sales tax&#8221; as compared to a graduated &#8220;income tax.&#8221;  As long as either tax is used to pay for the same government expenses, the sales tax is more  &#8220;regressive&#8221; than the graduated income tax because the poor spend a larger percentage of their income than the rich on items covered by the usual sales tax schemes.</p>
<p>But Social Security does not pay for government expenses.  It pays for the retirement of the person paying the tax.  So it is not a tax in the usual sense in which a tax is a payment to the government for government expenses.</p>
<p>And Social Security is designed so that people who end up poor after a lifetime of work get a much higher return on their &#8220;investment&#8221; than those who end up &#8220;well off.&#8221;  So the poor are paying LESS for what they get than the rich. The poor are getting MORE for what they  pay than the rich.  This is called &#8220;progressive.&#8221;  It is the opposite of &#8220;regressive.&#8221;</p>
<p>But you will never convince someone who got his PhD by saying &#8220;regressive tax, regressive tax.&#8221;  And that, my children, is why you won&#8217;t get Social Security when you get old.  Because the professional liberals will save you from that bad old regressive tax, regressive tax.</p>

<p>Health Care Thoughts: Counterproductive Regulations?</p>
<p>Depakote (divalproex sodium) is an anti-seizure medication approved by the FDA to treat epilepsy, migraines. and bipolar mania.    </p>
<p>Many physicians and long-term care nurses (including my favorite nurse) are absolutely convinced Depakote is effective in mitigating the impacts of agitated dementia. Depakote has also proved useful in treating other conditions.    </p>
<p>Depakote is important in long-term care because many other effective psych medications are routinely denied to nursing home patients by another set of counterproductive regulations (a topic for another column).    <br />Abbott Labs is now paying $1.6B in settlement of criminal and civil charges by the feds. The states will also get a small cut of the loot.    </p>
<p>Abbott&#8217;s crime? Telling physicians what they already k new, Depakote was a very valuable medication for &#8220;off-label&#8221; (unapproved uses).    </p>
<p>In the irony department, prescribing and administering Depakote for off-label uses is legal, and may be considered best practices in certain instances.    </p>
<p>The feds are thumping their chests (via press releases) about protecting patients and consumers, which is clearly not true. Abbott is going to bail out of the legacy drug business.    </p>
<p>There has to be a better way.    </p>
<p>Note; Both the government officials and the media has mentioned that Depakote was marketed to nursing homes. Nursing homes can only administer medications ordered by physicians, so marketing to nursing homes would be a complete waste of time?.Abbott actually plead guilty to this crime, which they very likely did not commit, just to get this case settled. Weird.</p>
<p>(Rdan&#8230;off label prescription of drugs is less common now but still widespread.   It is also an issue worth thinking about in relation to government policy, and also to examine physician expertise and competence in such matters either &#8216;on label&#8217; or &#8216;off label&#8217; in the aggregate, as well as the issue of trade regulations under the heading of health and medicine.   There is also the question of how to handle &#8216;best practice&#8217; and &#8216;evidence based&#8217; treatment, often full of the politics of medicine in addition to government regulation.  My thoughts can be found in comments.)</p>

<p><strong>Fixable Error</strong><br /><strong>New Insight</strong><br /><strong>and Social Security</strong><br />(amended version)<br />When errors are honest, and people keep talking in good faith, they are usually fixable. One of the errors I will talk about here is mine. The new insight is entirely the result of the good faith and honesty of Eric Laursen who has written a book about Social Security called The People&#8217;s Pension.</p>
<p>In the transcript ( <u><a href="http://retirementrevised.com/money/qa-eric-laursen-on-the-peoples-pension">http://retirementrevised.com/money/qa-eric-laursen-on-the-peoples-pension</a></u> ) of Mark Miller&#8217;s interview with Laursen about his book appears this statement regarding possible fixes for Social Security:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;A fallback would be to raise payroll taxes for everyone, but so slowly that it would have little impact – say, by 0.01 percent a year&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I knew this was wrong, and I thought I knew why: Lots of people get confused between 0.01 which is one percent of one, and 0.01 percent, which is one ten thousandth of whatever you are talking about. A tax increase of 0.01% on a 40,000 dollar per year income would be 4 dollars a year. This would not help Social Security. But it is marvelous that a tax increase of 0.05%, which is one half of one tenth of one percent, per year would solve the Social Security problem entirely. This is five times 0.01%, or about 20 dollars per year, per year, or about 40 cents per week, per year.</p>
<p>Laursen told me he had gotten the number from Monique Morrissey ( <u><a href="http://www.epi.org/page/-/old/briefingpapers/BriefingPaper287.pdf">http://www.epi.org/page/-/old/briefingpapers/BriefingPaper287.pdf</a></u> ).</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; These projected longevity gains, if they materialize, could also be offset by a 0.01 percentage-point increase in the payroll tax per year from 2025 to 2084 (from 6.2% to 6.8% overall). Over this 60-year period, average wages are projected to nearly double in inflation-adjusted terms. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>So I read Morrissey&#8217;s paper to see where she had gotten the number. Morrissey is primarily arguing against increasing the retirement age, and she wishes to show that increases in life expectancy are not the drivers of the projected shortfall in SS:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8221; However, gains in life expectancy represent only a small part of the fiscal challenge facing Social Security. The increase in the normal retirement age from 65 to 67, currently underway, already offsets gains in life expectancy for workers born before 1960, and longevity gains for younger generations account for only a fifth of the projected Social Security shortfall. &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>So the difficulty is not in the arithmetic, but in the fact that she is talking about only ONE cause of the projected shortfall, which by her reckoning is only one fifth of the problem.<br />That&#8217;s fine, but it can lead to confusion. As in fact it did for Laursen and me.</p>
<p>Morrissey&#8217;s essay is mostly written in opposition to raising the retirement age, and it is WELL WORTH READING.</p>
<p>She provided me with a new insight.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>That said, I disagree with her conclusion.</p>
<p>Her conclusion is that raising the cap on income subject to the payroll tax, scrapping it entirely, is the answer to the Social Security projected shortfall. I think that such a solution has no chance whatsoever in this political climate. And I do not think it would be a reasonable solution for a program that is successful exactly because it is NOT WELFARE. Raising the cap would turn SS into welfare by “taxing the rich” for benefits they will not get.</p>
<p>Moreover the cost of fixing SS by raising the payroll tax under the current cap is so tiny&#8230; forty cents per week&#8230; that no one would even feel it. And it would preserve the fundamental nature of Social Security: the “tax” is paid for by the workers who will get the benefits.</p>
<p>Morrissey appears to think of Social Security as “social welfare”, in which the whole society&#8230; and that means the rich&#8230; pay for the needs of the needy.</p>
<p>But American workers don’t see themselves as needy; they don’t want welfare; and they very much like the idea that they “paid for it themselves.”</p>
<p>And the American “rich” are not going to pay for the workers retirement. They see themselves as having a hard enough time paying for welfare for the truly needy without being asked to foot the bill for every single worker’s expected twenty years in retirement.</p>
<p>But Morrissey provided an insight which I had missed.</p>
<p>I have been saying that the need for the payroll tax increase is because future workers are going to be living longer in retirement than past workers.</p>
<p>Morrissey shows that in some important ways this is not exactly true. Future workers will not, in general, live significantly longer than current retirees. The increases in longevity will be mostly among the rich.</p>
<p>She shows the previous increases in longevity have largely been paid for by other factors, including increases in population and increases in incomes. I’ll leave you to read her essay to learn about this. Essentially I will argue that those other factors have masked the &#8220;true&#8221; cost of Social Security, and it would be serious error to to try to make up for changes in them by changing the fundamental nature of Social Security from &#8220;the workers pay for it themselves,&#8221; to &#8220;social insurance,&#8221; or what we call &#8220;welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is not that easy to correct demographic trends, or economic trends, or inequities in the earnings of the poor vs the rich. These are problems that should be addressed, but they should be addressed outside of Social Security. Social Security is insurance, designed to help people through bad times. It is a mistake to shoulder Social Security with the burden of correcting all the ills of society that may fall upon the poor.</p>
<p>But that brings me to my error. And why I am not going to “fix” it.</p>
<p>I came into the Social Security debate from a background that has nothing to do with politics or “social welfare.” This gives me a different “frame.” [note this is not Lakoff’s political framing, but more like framing a problem in physics so that it can be solved. Peter Peterson has framed the problem so it cannot be solved at all. Peterson has dedicated a billion dollars to making his framing the conventional wisdom, and I think Morrissey has accepted it without thinking too much about it.<br />Consider a universe in which, for the moment, there is no population growth, no increases in longevity, no economic growth, no inflation, no interest, no changes in longevity. </p>
<p>But in this universe people still work when they are adults and strong, and want to be able to retire at some point before they die. They will need to &#8220;save&#8221; for that retirement some of what they produce while they are working.</p>
<p>This leads to a Basic Retirement Equation:</p>
<p>years worked, times percent of earnings “saved,” equals years retired, times retirement income (as a percent of prior earnings).</p>
<p>So if you are going to work for forty years and expect to live ten years in retirement at 40% of your prior income, you would need to “save” ten percent of your income:</p>
<p><strong>40 X 10% = 10 X 40%</strong></p>
<p>It does not matter, in this universe, if you save this as gold in a box, or as a non-cash implicit agreement by which working adults pay for the needs of the elderly, or by a formal pay as you go “tax”.</p>
<p>In all cases you are deferring 10% of your present income so that you will have enough to live on when you get old. This can be done by hoarding “gold”, which is dangerous, or by implicit “honor your mother and your father” agreement between generations, or by an explicit government-managed (but not “government paid”) tax and benefit system.</p>
<p>Now imagine another universe in which nothing has changed except that you expect to live 20 years in retirement. The equation now becomes:</p>
<p>&#8220;40 years working, times 20% savings, equals 20 years in retirement, times 40% “replacement benefit.”</p>
<p>This may look like a lot of money to save, or be taxed, but it would be a perfectly reasonable solution to the problem of living for twenty years after you become too old to work, or want to work. The key here is you have to realize the 20% is “your money”. You saved it. And it will be you who spends it.<br />As long as the other members of the society agree that this is a reasonable way to apportion earnings between working years and retirement years, it is no problem. Especially if the workers agree that money not used by those who die earlier than the 20 year expectancy will be used to pay for the needs of those who live longer. This is not welfare. It’s insurance.</p>
<p>Now, in the real world, the fact has been that other factors including income growth and population growth&#8230; at least the population of workers in the Social Security program&#8230; have worked to reduce the needed “savings” or tax rate. [Also, for the past few hundred years or so, &#8220;interest&#8221; or &#8220;capital growth, including appreciation of stocks, has reduced the needed &#8220;savings&#8221; rate. But this has been accompanied by the risks of inflation and market losses, which is what Social Security was invented to provide insurance against.]</p>
<p>But these other factors are OUTSIDE of Social Security. And Social Security does not depend on them to work.</p>
<p>It may be that rising income inequality, reductions in birth rate, or other economic and demographic factors will affect the tax rate needed to provide a reasonable retirement “rate.” But the BASIC fact is that it is the ratio between working years and retirement years that determines “the cost of retirement.”</p>
<p>Social Security is designed explicitly to take care of the ups and downs in the economy, including demographics. If rates have to go up, or if benefits have to come down in response to hard times, so be it. That is the history of the human race: There are fat years and lean years.</p>
<p>Some people argue, in bad faith I think, that ups and downs in Social Security &#8220;return on investment&#8221; are a kind of generational crime. They prefer you don&#8217;t look at the ups and downs in return on investment in the private markets. Even that box of gold under the bed, or the ability of the working adults in a family to care for their own elderly relatives, or the ability of investors to realize a rate of return they need to fund their own retirement&#8230; will be subject to factors like demographics, wars, the state of the economy, inflation, market losses, and will result in greater or lower &#8220;returns on investment&#8221; from one generation to the next. But the enemies of Social Security want you to think that if SS does not make exactly the same return to each generation, some generation is being &#8220;robbed.&#8221;</p>
<p>As it happens we are looking at&#8230; according to the Trustees&#8230; a period of time where some of the factors that have held down the cost of Social Security in the past will not be as much of a help in the future as they have been in the past. These &#8220;anti-factors&#8221; include rising inequality of income, a falling birth rate, lower productivity gains.. a combination of factors that will require either a benefit cut of about 20% or a tax raise of about 4%, which can be phased in over about eighty years, at one half of one tenth of one percent at a time.</p>
<p>Cutting a benefit that is already at survival level by 20% is insane. Raising a tax 4% over about 80 years wouldn’t even be felt. [The 4% tax increase would occur while incomes are increasing more than 100%, so that, in round numbers, after eighty years your after tax income will have increased 96% instead of 100%&#8230; you are not going to notice the difference&#8230; unless of course you threw away your Social Security in order to &#8220;save&#8221; that 4%.]</p>
<p>But these factors are external to the basic mathematics of retirement, especially from the perspective of the individual. The basic relation is: {the number of years you work compared to the number of years you expect to be retired} determines {the ratio between tax rate and benefit rate}.  </p>
<p>While it is true that relying on the “whole economy pays for everybody” could in principle produce the same result, on average, through general taxation and a &#8220;government pension.&#8221; This perspective leads to an understanding which is basically wrong, and which the politics of this country, and the psychology of both the workers and the “rich” is not ready to accept. We prefer an explicit relation between the money we &#8220;save&#8221; as individuals and the benefits we get as individuals. We prudently modify this principle enough to allow for an insurance factor whereby those who cannot save enough over a lifetime of work to pay for a decent retirement are helped out by the &#8220;excess&#8221; of those who were able to save &#8220;more than enough&#8221; in the protected savings plan we know as Social Security. But the principle is still essentially &#8220;you pay for what you get.&#8221;</p>
<p>Morrissey may be correct that only one fifth of the projected shortfall is “due to” rising life expectancies, but that is because those other factors that have previously reduced the cost due to rising life expectancies may no longer be able to do so.   </p>
<p>We cannot easily change those factors, but going from there to propose a “solution” that destroys the fundamental nature of Social Security by changing it from “worker pays” to “the rich pay,” will in the first place not be accepted by those rich who have the political power in this country, and in the second place would deprive the workers of both the satisfaction and the political power of being able to say “I paid for it myself.”</p>
<p>If there were no alternative&#8230; if the extra revenue needed for a decent retirement were beyond the reach of the workers, then a welfare solution might be necessary&#8230; though this would be a bad way to arrange an economy over the long run. But since the cost of “fixing” Social Security, whatever the reason for the shortfall, amounts to only forty cents per week per year, it is far, far better that the workers pay for it themselves than to have them go to Mr. Richfellow and say, “Please, Sir, can I have some more?”</p>
<p>Meanwhile I will keep saying the need for the “tax” increase is because we are going to be living longer. I believe this is the more fundamental truth. And it’s certainly a lot easier to explain to people than all the complications Morrissey addresses in her essay. And it leads to the correct solution: the workers need to pay a little more for their own retirement because they will be living longer. </p>
<p>When you go to the store you do not go up to a well dressed stranger and say, “Sir, it looks like you have more money than I have. Please pay for my groceries.”</p>
<p>Social Security is you paying now while you have the money for the groceries you will need later when you may not have the money. That is a lot better for the country, and a lot safer for the workers, than teaching them to expect &#8220;the rich&#8221; to pay for the predictable costs of a large, and normal, part of their lives.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;There hasn&#8217;t been any serious investigation of any of the large financial entities by the Justice Department, which includes the FBI,&#8221; says William Black, an associate professor of economics and law at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, who, as a government regulator in the 1980s, helped clean up the S&#038;L mess. Black, who is a Democrat, notes that the feds dealt with the S&#038;L crisis with harsh justice, bringing more than a thousand prosecutions, and securing a 90 percent conviction rate. The difference between the government&#8217;s response to the two crises, Black says, is a matter of will, and priorities. &#8220;You need heads on the pike,&#8221; he says. &#8220;The first President Bush&#8217;s orders were to get the most prominent, nastiest frauds, and put their heads on pikes as a demonstration that there&#8217;s a new sheriff in town.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>SEC Disagrees with Supreme Court’s Anti-U.S. Investor Morrison Decision and Favors Clearly Defined Private Right of Action against Foreign Wrongdoers, rather than Abolition of U.S. Investors’ Legal Rights, SEC Staff Study Asserts</strong></p>
<p>May 9, 2012    </p>
<p>The U.S. Solicitor General and the US Securities and Exchange Commission recommended the Supreme Court continue to permit U.S. investors who suffer losses as part of a transnational securities fraud to take legal action in US Courts against the foreign perpetrators. That position was stated in briefs filed with the Supreme Court before the Court’s controversial June 24, 2010 Morrison v. National Australia Bank decision curtailing the right of U.S. investors to sue foreign wrongdoers unless the securities at issue are listed on a U.S. stock exchange.<br />     <br />In a study released last month, the SEC Staff said the Commission stands by the views expressed in its pre-decision brief, which also recommended the Court adopt a standard authorizing U.S. private investor actions when the U.S. component of the fraud directly causes investors’ injuries. The April SEC study was required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. [See SEC staff study <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2012/929y-study-cross-border-private-rights.pdf">here.</a>]    </p>
<p>The majority of public comments (44 of 72 respondents) on Morrison submitted to the SEC supported overturning restoring Americans’ right to take action in US courts against foreign-listed companies who defraud them. Indeed, all the letters to the SEC from investors and investor representatives – including 30 pension funds &#8212; supported restoring the private right of action. To do so will require Congressional action.    </p>
<p><em>SEC Staff Found No Evidence that Private Actions Cause Economic Harm</em><br />    <br />There is no economic rationale for the Morrison decision, the SEC study found. Although the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other anti-consumer legal “reform” proponents have long claimed that “frivolous” lawsuits impose unfair economic burdens on companies and discourage foreign companies from listing on U.S. securities exchanges, the SEC staff found no evidence backing such assertions.    <br />
<blockquote>“Considering both the existing economic research and the results of our analysis, we are unable to document evidence of either economic costs or economic benefits that could be clearly and directly linked to extending a private right of action.”</p></blockquote>
<p>[See appendix B, page B-1 of SEC Staff report].    <br /><i>SEC Staff Restate’s Importance of Private Actions in Law Enforcement</i>    </p>
<p>Moreover, on page one of its Morrison study, the SEC staff re-stated the Commission’s long-standing position (affirmed in several Supreme Court decisions) that meritorious private lawsuits are an important supplement to civil and criminal law-enforcement actions. Such private actions are part of the superior U.S. securities regulatory system that provides foreign companies who list here with an “investor protection premium.”</p>
<p> The SEC staff explained:<br />    <br />
<blockquote>“Another question raised . . . is whether greater exposure to U.S. securities laws and regulations would cause an increase in firm value. The primary focus on whether a firm can increase value through bonding to U.S. securities laws has been [the subject of several] studies of cross-listings. Many of these studies have concluded that there is a valuation premium associated with cross-listing a foreign firm on a U.S. exchange.    <br />. . . In addition to a possible valuation premium, evidence of bonding includes improved corporate governance for firms that cross-list on U.S. exchanges. Specifically, economists have found evidence of a reduced cost of capital . . .     <br />. . . Economists have also found evidence that firms with U.S. cross-listings obtain: (a) better access to larger capital markets (“segmentation hypothesis”), (b) increased liquidity for shareholders, (c) increased visibility (“recognition hypothesis”), and (d) an improvement in price discovery (“information channel”).”</p></blockquote>
<p>[See pages B-4 through B-7 of SEC study]    <br />Morrison Unnecessarily Restricts Investor Protection and Imposes $2.2 billion “Tax” on Pension Funds Forced to Buy ADRs<br />    </p>
<p>Commenting on the SEC staff study and Morrison decision, Salvatore J. Graziano, Esq., a partner with Bernstein Litowitz Berger &#038; Grossman, LLP and president of the National Association of Shareholder &#038; Consumer Attorneys said</p>
<p>
<blockquote>“Congress should overturn Morrison to restore investors&#8217; full range of protection against fraud, enable investors to recover their losses, and to help deter fraud and other wrongdoing in the United States by corporations who operate or cause harm in the United States, but list their securities overseas. Restoration of investors&#8217; private right of action against such companies also would help United States pension funds comply with covenants directing them to reduce risk by diversifying portfolios geographically and by industry; but, at the same time, not limiting protections afforded by Unites States securities laws. Morrison unnecessarily limits those protections and the choices of pension funds.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And, according to one analysis cited by SEC staff, Morrison also imposes a de facto tax upon those pension funds seeking to diversify by purchasing American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) &#8212; negotiable securities traded on US exchanges representing underlying foreign securities, which themselves do not trade in the US. ADRs, however, are generally less liquid (harder to sell quickly) than the actual shares traded on a foreign exchange, and may cost pension funds more to buy and hold than purchasing the underlying foreign securities directly on a non-US exchange.    </p>
<p>The SEC staff cited an analysis of virtually all US funds with international equity investments. The study found a substantial “tax” imposed upon pension funds that choose ADRs because of Morrison:    <br />
<blockquote>“[T]he amount of those assets are $819 billion and the amount to maintain that investment in ADRs, given their increased pricing, would amount to an additional “tax” for the use of American law of $2.2 billion. To impose this additional tax solely so Americans can utilize the laws that Congress has passed for their benefit is fundamentally unfair and puts funds and their fiduciaries in a fundamentally unfair position having to choose to pay increased costs for ADRs or to purchase international securities on foreign exchanges.”</p></blockquote>
<p>[See page 47 of SEC study.]    <br /><i>Congress Should Overturn Morrison and Restore U.S. Investors’ Rights</i>    </p>
<p>As a matter of simple justice and investor protection, Congress should restore the right of American citizens to take action in U.S. courts against foreign-listed companies who defraud them. Will Congress have the back-bone to stand up to multinational corporate interests and do so?     <br />That question will likely only be answered after the November federal elections.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <div>by <a href="http://presimetrics.com/">Mike Kimel</a></p>
<p>In my lifetime, the following Presidents have run for re-election:  Nixon, Ford, Carter, Reagan, GHW Bush, Clinton, GW Bush, and now, Obama.  What is striking about this list is that of this crowd, only three:  Nixon, Reagan and Clinton appeared to be at all successful by the time they started running for re-election from any objective point of view.</p></div>
<div></div>
<div>Nixon may have been the most successful of the three by the end of his first term.  Inflation was still a year away, as was the collapse of Bretton Woods and the Oil Embargo.  On the foreign policy front, Vietnam&#8230;  well, that wasn&#8217;t pretty, but there was the trip to China, and there were a couple missile &#038; nuke treaties with the USSR.  On his signature New Federalism policy, the Post Office lost its cabinet level status and he created the EPA (while, at roughly the same time, killing the Clean Water Act).   Of course, it was all downhill from his re-election.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As to Reagan and Clinton, neither was a complete success by the time they ran for re-election.  Reagan had reintroduced us to the era of deficits as high as far as the eye could see, but inflation was finally tamed (whether you give credit to Volcker or Reagan is immaterial &#8211; the average voter knew Reagan but not Volcker) and Reagan had definitely convinced us it was morning in America, though many felt the Rising Sun was eclipsing the United States.  Clinton had failed to get his signature health care plan across, and he had even lost Congress to the opposition Republicans, but by 1996 we were in the middle of our fourth year of deficit reduction, and the fears that Japan was about to overtake America had receded into the distant past.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>As to the failures&#8230;  Ford didn&#8217;t have a long first term, but he certainly didn&#8217;t Whip Inflation Now.  Carter&#8217;s first two and a half years looked good, and then&#8230; we had the Iran hostage affair, the oil crisis, the tanking economy and rising inflation, the botched response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan (boycotting the Olympics).  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Bush I &#8211; well, it wasn&#8217;t for nothing that Clinton ran on &#8220;it&#8217;s the economy, stupid.&#8221;  On the foreign policy side, the war in the Persian Gulf went well, and made for good TV, but everyone knew stopping after 100 hours was a bad idea and price would be paid eventually.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bush II &#8211; by 2004, he had disappeared the surpluses, tanked the economy, and was mismanaging two wars.  (Remember the old:  &#8220;you don&#8217;t change horses midstream&#8221; nonsense?  The fact that the horse was rolling around in the sewer should have been a tip-off it was long past time to get as far away from that particular horse as possible.)  </div>
<div></div>
<div>And now we have Obama.  Yes, he inherited an economic disaster, but he hasn&#8217;t successfully executed the policies needed to make things better in a reasonable amount of time.  (That is true regardless of what policies you think are necessary &#8211; the evidence is that the economy, while better than they were in November 2008 or January 2009, is still a turkey.)  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Which brings up a point.  I remember thinking to myself, at this point in 2004 that if GW Bush was as patriotic as he kept telling us, and he believed in what he was doing, he&#8217;d have been honest and concluded the exigencies of the office were too much for him.  He could still have advanced his policies by resigning and letting his VP, Dick Cheney run for President as an incumbent.  Or, if he felt Cheney wasn&#8217;t the best candidate to push forth the agenda in which he believed, GW could have fired Mr. Cheney, replaced him with that ideal candidate, and then resigned.  Instead, GW, with evidence of his failures all around him, decided to double down&#8230; and as we all have seen, make things worse. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Its an option most of these failed first terms could easily have followed.  Its one that Obama could follow (but won&#8217;t).  You have to go back as far as Lyndon Johnson to hear this being stated:</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<blockquote> I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your President.</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It speaks poorly of our Presidents that we hear that phrase so rarely when the job of the President is so important.  And it speaks poorly of the American public, that we collectively continue to elect and re-elect people who are so unpatriotic and uncaring that they cannot do the right thing.</div>

<p> A <a href="http://www.epi.org/files/2012/bp340-labor-market-young-graduates.pdf">report</a> from the <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/bp340-labor-market-young-graduates/">Economic Policy Institute</a> shows that recent college graduates who will be eligible to cast their first votes in a presidential election are unable to find jobs. According to the report, unemployment for young college graduates was 10.4% in 2010, and the underemployment rate was 19.8%. For young high school graduates, the statistics were even grimmer: unemployment was 32.7% in 2010, and the underemployment rate was 55.9%.</p>

                                <p>by<strong> David Zetland</strong><br />reposted with permission from <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2011/05/full-cost-pricing-poor-or-both.html">Aguanomics</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2011/05/full-cost-pricing-poor-or-both.html">Full cost pricing, the poor, or both?</a>On 19 April in Berlin, I joined a debate in <i>favor</i> of the following proposition: <br />
<blockquote>Is cost recovery pricing the best way to ensure the poor have access to good water services?</p></blockquote>
<p>I was seconded by Dr William Muhairwe, Managing Director of the NWSC Uganda.  <br />Arguing against full cost pricing were Wenonah Hauter (Executive Director of Food and Water Watch) and Anil Naidoo (Blue Planet Project Organizer for the Council of Canadians). Wenonah and Anil are colleagues of Maude Barlow.*  </p>
<p>The conference used the provocative URL of &#8220;<a href="http://www.watermeetsmoney.com/">water meets money</a>,&#8221; and that name alone was enough to attract <a href="http://www.globalwaterintel.com/insight/water-meets-money-meets-street-protest.html">15-20 anti-corporate greed protestors</a> (there were about 450 attendees at the conference).** Their attendance was particularly ironic, since it was corporate money that upgraded Berlin&#8217;s water system over the past ten years (at lower cost than was expected of the previous, public-only management).  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />We won the debate. That was not such a surprise with a crowd that has fought to get adequate money for water services. What I thought interesting was the way that Wenonah and Anil chose to argue their position.  </p>
<p>Rather than pay attention to the ongoing failures of water service, governance and political leadership in places where the poor lack water service, they claimed that corporations should pay more taxes. Although it sounded like they were presenting talking points instead of responding to the position that William and I presented, I guess that they were thinking that this pot of money combined with the UN-backed human right to water would deliver services. But their argument was weak on several levels:  
<ol>
<li>They failed to address governance failures. </li>
<li>They failed to acknowledge successes of full cost pricing in places like Uganda (and many others). </li>
<li>They failed to consider how higher tax revenues on corporations (should they even be collected!) would somehow get to water providers, and THEN support water services to the poor.</li>
</ol>
<p>I concentrated on two points:  
<ol>
<li>Subsidies to the poor (via income transfers or even <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2009/05/fixed-and-variable-costs-redux.html">some for free, pay for more</a> water prices) are not incompatible with full cost pricing within a water utility. </li>
<li>Subsides from the central government (or aid agencies) are unstable and come with strings attached. Given the problems that governments face (from the US to India), it seems folly to link water services to political games that would rank water way down the list of priorities.***</li>
</ol>
<p>My partner, William, presented even stronger points. He spoke from experience of delivering water to the largest cities in Uganda. Compared to him, Anil sounded way more &#8220;let&#8217;s sing kumbaya, guys&#8221; than realistic.   </p>
<p>But don&#8217;t believe me, listen to the whole debate <a href="http://www.globalwaterintel.com/great-water-debate-2011/">here</a> [<a href="http://www.kysq.org/docs/2011.04.19_Great_water_debate.mp3">MP3 backup</a>]. The first few minutes of my statement were not recorded. Here are <a href="http://www.kysq.org/docs/Zetland_outline.pdf">my notes</a> [pdf]; I didn&#8217;t use them all.    </p>
<p>Wenonah also made some funny claims about my previous ideas (she totally misunderstood all-in-auctions and called me a Stalinist for my idea of pricing water per person). <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wenonah-hauter/the-next-big-thing-in-ind_b_854796.html%20">Here&#8217;s her take</a> on the debate, which includes the classic line &#8220;&#8230;is it any surprise that we lost 75% to 25%? Anyway, Anil and I knew we won the debate on the merits and ethics of our arguments.&#8221; Sounds like something that Gaddafi, Mugabe or Mubarak would say (as defenders of Their People).</p>
