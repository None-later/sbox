                            <div class="content">
                                <p>First a recap:
<p>Philip Tetlock’s <em><a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Expert_Political_Judgment.html?id=QgGRar_TCjIC">Expert Political Judgment</a> </em>was a groundbreaking look at whether political experts really are expert, as judged by their success at making predictions. His overall conclusion: they aren’t. But (lifted from a <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=1366">previous post</a>):</p>
<p><em>…among the experts,</em> ”foxes” — those who in Nicholas Kristof’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/26/opinion/26Kristof.html?_r=1">words</a> are “are more cautious, more centrist, more likely to adjust their views, more pragmatic, more prone to self-doubt, more inclined to see complexity and nuance” — resoundingly beat out the “hedgehogs” — those who “have a focused worldview, an ideological leaning, strong convictions.”</p>
<p>This even while hedgehogs end up getting the biggest megaphones for their incorrect predictions.</p>
<p>But as Bryan Caplan pointed out quite cogently, there were two key flaws in Tetlock’s methodology (my words here, <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=1366">again from my previous post</a>):</p>
<p>1. He only examines questions that are highly controversial among experts. (If 50% believe each way, 50% will inevitably be wrong.) Tetlock explicitly ignores the “dumb” questions that seem to the experts to have obvious answers, but which everyday folks might consider controversial.</p>
<p>2. He doesn’t compare the the experts to the average person on the street. The only such comparison in the book is between experts and Berkeley undergrads — who are darned high on the elite/expert spectrum, in absolute terms. And even in that comparison, <strong>the experts win in a landslide</strong>. The undergrads aren’t even as good as chimps or dartboards.</p>
<p>Back to the present: Tetlock’s latest initiative, the <a href="http://www.goodjudgmentproject.com/">Good Judgment Project</a>, looks to address those shortcomings. The first-round results are in — reported in an <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/05/an-email-from-philip-tetlock.html">email to Tyler Cowen</a> – and they’re eye-opening. Their predictors:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>collectively blew the lid off the performance expectations</strong> that IARPA had for the first year. Their original hope was that in Year 1 the best forecasting submissions might be able to outperform the unweighted average forecasts of the control group by 20%. When we created weighted-averaging algorithms that gave more weight to our most insightful and engaged forecasters, these algorithms <strong>beat that baseline by <em>roughly 60%</em></strong> (exceeding IARPA’s expectations for Year 4).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And what, you may ask, are the characteristics of their successful expert predictors?</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>(1) an intense curiosity</strong> about the workings of the political-economic world; <strong>(2) an intense curiosity</strong> about the workings of the human mind; (3) cognitive crunching power (“fluid intelligence” and a capacity for “timely self correction”).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again: the foxes kick the hedgehogs’ butts.</p>
<p>I always agreed with the commentary about George W and his ilk — that they have no real curiosity about how the world works, they just seek confirmation of their existing (and often simplistic) beliefs — but I never considered it much of a knock-down argument. These results — once we see them explained (the email is pretty thin stuff) — may change my beliefs about that.</p>
<p>Caveat: these “curiosity” criteria are uncannily good at describing Philip Tetlock, Bryan Caplan, Tyler Cowen, and me. I tend to look askance at findings that are self-congratulatory.</p>
<p>Justin Fox <a href="http://blogs.hbr.org/fox/2012/05/how-to-be-bad-at-forecasting.html">reports and ruminates on his experience</a> as a fairly mediocre forecaster in the project (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>So what distinguishes a <em>bad</em> forecaster? In my case, two things: (1) a discomfort with expressing my level of confidence with the size of my bets — this is a real flaw, perhaps traceable to the fact that I had never played a game of poker until two weeks ago; and (2) an almost complete lack of interest in the events being forecast. I think I’m pretty curious about the workings of the political-economic world. I just wasn’t interested in whether the IMF would officially announce before 1 April 2012 that an agreement had been reached to lend Hungary an additional 15+ Billion Euros.</p>
<p>… Hedgehogs who are obsessively focused on a particular theory of how the world works aren’t very good at forecasting. But foxes who don’t care aren’t very good at it either. The best forecasters would appear to be foxes who really really want to win the game of forecasting. To quote Saffo again, the key is to <strong>“hold strong opinions weakly.”</strong> Don’t be stuck in your views; be willing to revise them quickly when new information comes in. But have bold views, or don’t bother trying to make forecasts.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <div>Last February, in the lead-up to the all-important Michigan primary, Romney wrote <a href="http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120214/OPINION01/202140336/Romney-op-ed-Taxpayers-should-get-GM-shares-proceeds">an op-ed piece</a> in the Detroit News titled “U.S. autos bailout &#8216;was crony capitalism on a grand scale&#8217;.”  The dual purpose of the piece was to defend the recommendation he made in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html?_r=1">a November 18, 2008 op-ed article</a> in the New York Times titled “Let Detroit Go Bankrupt” by saying falsely that GM and Chrysler did not need federal funds to proceed successfully through bankruptcy reorganization rather than having to liquidate, and to complain that the terms of the federally-financed bankruptcy outcome included an agreement by which the UAW received shares of stock in GM in exchange for the union’s assuming the company’s healthcare liability. </div>
<div></div>
<div>In <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/24/opinion/delusions-about-the-detroit-bailout.html">a rebuttal op-ed </a>in the New York Times, Steven Rattner, the Obama administration’s auto taskforce chief advisor and himself a venture capitalist, deconstructed Romney’s claims, especially the statement that private capital was available to fund the reorganization process.  Rattner wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In late 2008 and early 2009, when G.M. and Chrysler had exhausted their liquidity, every scrap of private capital had fled to the sidelines.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I know this because the administration’s auto task force, for which I was the lead adviser, spoke diligently to all conceivable providers of funds, and not one had the slightest interest in financing those companies on any terms. If Mr. Romney disagrees, he should come forward with specific names of willing investors in place of empty rhetoric. I predict that he won’t be able to, because there aren’t any.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So even though Rattner is a venture capitalist, I was a little surprised to read that <a href="http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/05/exobama-advisor-latest-antiromney-ad-is-unfair-123353.html">he characterized a new Obama ad as unfair</a> for targeting Romney’s work as a venture capitalist for Bain Capital by illustrating what that work actually entailed.  The ad, which responds to Romney’s claim to have created 100,000 jobs while at Bain, shows what happened at a Kansas City steel mill that Bain bought not for the purpose of creating jobs but for the purpose of shuttering it after Bain had made some money from it. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rattner said that the two candidates should not pretend that the purpose of venture capitalism is to create jobs.  Romney, he said, should not have claimed that he created 100,000 jobs while at Bain.  And Obama should not complain that Bain’s brand of venture capitalism often was to buy ongoing businesses, milk them quickly, and disassemble them in liquidation or for the value of their parts.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Bain Capital&#8217;s responsibility was not to create 100,000 jobs or some other number. It was to create profits for its investors,” Rattner is quoted as saying. “This is part of capitalism, this is part of life.  I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s anything Bain Capital did that they need to be embarrassed about.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, okay.  And the more common types of venture capitalism—of the funding-of-Silicon-Valley-or-biotech-start-up variety, for example—will, if all goes well, create profits for the investors <i>and</i> create jobs.  But that’s not the type of venture capitalist Romney was. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yet the entire premise of Romney’s campaign is that he’ll use his business acumen, demonstrated during his Bain years, to create jobs, not that he’ll use it to create profits for investors.  He’s running for president, not for chairman of the board of Goldman Sachs.  Which is why he says he created 100,000 jobs as head of Bain Capital.  And which is why Obama wants to show that, well, Bain Capital&#8217;s responsibility was not to create 100,000 jobs or some other number; it was instead to create profits for its investors.  And that it created profits for its investors.  And exactly <i>how</i> it did that, and what the consequence was for the employees who were the collateral damage.  (“<a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/burns-haberman/2012/05/obamas-bain-ad-like-watching-an-old-friend-bleed-to-123343.html">Like watching an old friend bleed to death</a>,” one of the former steel mill employees says in the ad.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Rattner’s right that it is indeed part of capitalism, part of life.  And Bain Capital may not have done anything it needs to be embarrassed about.  But Bain Capital is not running for president claiming that its purpose is to create jobs and that it knows how to have the economy create hundreds of thousands of jobs each month, when in fact its sole purpose is to make a profit for its investors and all it has demonstrated is that it can do that well and that job creation and job loss are irrelevant to its purpose and to the outcomes.  Romney, by contrast, is running for president claiming exactly that.  An ad by his opponent pointing out that, contrary to his incessant assertions, Romney’s work at Bain was disconnected from job creation in both purpose and result is not only fair but directly on point.  </p>

<div>I would think so, and for that reason I debated whether to write the post.  I decided to write it because I’ve been surprised that there has been almost no public discussion, best as I can tell, about the difference between the type of venture capitalism that helps startups or helps companies expand, and the type of venture capitalism—appropriately nicknamed vulture capitalism—that Romney practiced at Bain Capital.  For example, the prominent Silicon Valley venture capitalists do not (to my knowledge) buy companies in order to strip them down or outright liquidate them. The key paragraph in my post is:
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, okay.  And the more common types of venture capitalism—of the funding-of-Silicon-Valley-or-biotech-start-up variety, for example—will, if all goes well, create profits for the investors <i>and</i> create jobs.  But that’s not the type of venture capitalist Romney was.

<div>I’d love to see mainstream news outlets and the Obama campaign discuss this.

                                <p>Stan Collender notes that, for the first time in four years, <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2550/why-no-one-washington-wants-talk-about-fiscal-policy" target="_blank">the U.S. Treasury reported a surplus in the month of April</a>.  It isn’t just that there was a surplus in April of 2008, though.  If you look back through Aprils (data <a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/mts/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>), the last time that month showed a deficit is 1983—the April less than six months after the last official “double-dip” of recessions.<br />Stan offers three reasons that the White House doesn’t want to point out this good news.  I consider the first two somewhat silly—the GOP never hesitates to take about the deficit, except to deny its responsibility, and no politically-alert Democrat will see the April surplus as representative of “the wrong fiscal policy” so much as an indication that employment last year was better than it has been.<br />It’s his third reason that is most interesting:<br />
<blockquote>While that&#8217;s likely to be $200 billion or more less than what was recorded for 2011, the deficit will still be close to $1 trillion and that would be hard to defend.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m assuming the phrase “close to $1 trillion” means that Stan assumes the actual FY2012 deficit will be lower than $1T.  The original projection was just under $1.3T. Getting that down to $1T would be 23% better than the original projection, not to mention the psychological gain of being back down below thirteen digits again. Even $1.1T would be just about a 15% improvement over the original projections.  If a 15%+ improvement in the deficit over your projections isn’t worth saluting, then what is?<br />Stan concludes:<br />
<blockquote>This is a little-understood part of the federal budget debate. Even if the 2012 deficit was half of what it was in 2011, and even if that reduction were applauded by Wall Street and the economic community, it would still be a painfully difficult political issue. In fact, long after the deficit has fallen to the point where most economists are comfortable with it, the political advantage will still be with those who criticize it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Far be it for me to argue, but…just for the sake of argument, I decided to compare President Obama’s record with that of the last sitting President running for re-election on The Two Issues that Abide, The Deficit and Jobs.</p>
<p>First, Deficit:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-SPHWvOxqk58/T7HQ09QSLLI/AAAAAAAAA-g/VYF9f7IE8V8/s1600-h/dFYFSD%252520Obama%252520v%252520Bush%25255B11%25255D.png"><img alt="dFYFSD Obama v Bush" border="0" height="468" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-CaW3bgrqm2o/T7HQ1TqDlMI/AAAAAAAAA-o/K0d0HwwHbJ0/dFYFSD%252520Obama%252520v%252520Bush_thumb%25255B7%25255D.png?imgmax=800" title="dFYFSD Obama v Bush" width="644"></a> </p>
<p>We don’t, of course, have the data for the deficit at the end of this year yet. (We have data for subsequent years of debt for the Previous Administration, of course, but nothing that would have been public knowledge by the voting in November of 2004.)</p>
<p>The story here is a clear one: the previous incumbent increased the deficit significantly; the current one has reduced it from the baseline he inherited. (If the current year ends up with around a $1T deficit, Year 3 will be around +$400,000.)</p>
<p>So the current Administration has been taking the deficit in the “right direction.”  But, of course, that’s only good if you are in a growing economy (for the Democratic knowledgeable; see Stan’s second point) or because the Previous Administration was “priming the pump” for the Great Growth that would follow. (After all, what the 2001 tax regression didn’t solve, certainly the 2003 Hubbard-Mankiw version would.)</p>
<p>So let’s check how well that Growth Thing worked.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/private-sector-employment-in-jobless.html" target="_blank">I’ve already pointed out that the post-recession public-sector employment between the current and the previous Administrations was about 600,000 jobs almost nine months ago</a>.  So let’s be as nice as possible and compare Total Employment Gains since their respective Recessions, knowing that we’re spotting the Previous Administration when looking at total Non-Farm Payroll:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-z36rB9ASSmI/T7HQ2FGKb_I/AAAAAAAAA-w/VU7Pg4P8rlM/s1600-h/payemspostrecession%25255B3%25255D.png"><img alt="payemspostrecession" border="0" height="467" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-_A6VmjHz6_c/T7HQ25g3LwI/AAAAAAAAA-4/PPATlHRJrXY/payemspostrecession_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" title="payemspostrecession" width="644"></a> </p>
<p>The Obama Administration got employment back to the end-of-recession level after sixteen (16) months; it took the previous Administration twenty-eight (28) months. Counting from the end of the recession, the Previous Administration produced just under 1.4MM jobs in the thirty-four (34) months to the next election (Dec 2001-Oct 2004). </p>
<p>The Obama Administration has produced more than twice that (2.825MM) in thirty-three (33) months.<br />In summary, if we compare the current Administration to the previous one, it has (1) produced twice as many new jobs, (2) produced budgets that reduced the annual Federal deficit instead of making it greater, and (3) reduced our troop presence in wars started by the Previous Administration while finding and eliminating Public Enemy #1.</p>
<p>And the only thing it wants to talk about is the third.</p>
<p>As I said <i>chez </i>Collender, If this Administration is afraid to run on its gains because there is less &#8220;political advantage&#8221; in highlighting the improvements your Administration has produced than in getting bashed for something for which you will perpetually get bashed, then the country is truly lost.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/05/main-point.html">Peter Dorman</a> at <i>Econospeak</i> brings us another reminder about policy decisions on the economy.  Reposted from Econospeak:</p>
<p><strong>The Main Point</strong></p>
<p>Macroeconomics is complicated and political economy is devilish, so it is easy to get lost in the details.  From time to time, it’s good to come up for air—to remember what the fundamental issue is.  In a way, the debate over structural versus cyclical factors invites us to do just that.  </p>
<p>Suppose the current recession/depression is mainly structural.  Suppose it is due to an immense misallocation of capital and labor, a failure to foresee what our economy would really demand in the years ahead.  According to this story, we have trained too many masons and anthropologists and invested in too many building cranes and liberal arts colleges, and it will take years to shift our human and produced resources to more valuable pursuits.  (Actually, I think there continues to be an enormous misallocation of investment, but this will become apparent only when the threat of global warming is taken seriously.)  If the structuralist story is right, the ongoing slump is necessary and unavoidable and will end only when we have fashioned the resources for producing the right stuff.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />If the cyclical story is predominately true, however, we have neither the wrong people nor the wrong capital stock.  We have all the ingredients it takes to have a vibrant economy that can fully employ our populations and generate a standard of living that surpasses what we had in the past and that keeps growing further.  But think about it: if we have the wherewithal to resume prosperity, what holds us back?  And why should rational people accept any excuses for policies that delay it?  </p>
<p>Repeat: we have everything we need, right now, to restart our economies.  All the unemployment, the hardship, the lost opportunities are unnecessary.  That’s the main point.  </p>
<p>The secondary point is about the why.  There are ultimately two reasons why economies like ours get stuck in a cyclical rut.  The first is that there is a reinforcing cycle of insufficient demand and insufficient investment.  This is where standard countercyclical policy comes in: through fiscal deficits the government increases demand on its own initiative, and through monetary easing an impetus is added to investment.  We are near the limit of what easing can do (diminishing returns to the QE’s), but not anywhere near the limit of fiscal expansion.  </p>
<p>The second reason arises in balance sheet recessions: too much private borrowing has taken place, debtors find it difficult to sustain debt service, and both debtors and creditors retrench.  In this case, which is ours, the essential problem is that fulfillment of claims on wealth—both credit claims and equity claims on debt-related assets—interferes with the conditions required for restarting growth.  In other words, the shadow of past wealth creation is depriving new wealth creation of sunlight.  While respecting wealth claims is desirable during normal times, since it supports long-term planning, there come episodes in which a choice must be made between the past and the future.  This is such a time.  Wealth claims need to be trimmed, quickly and sufficiently, in order to reduce leverage and permit economies to return to growth.  We shouldn’t forget the main point, which is that economic growth produces the stuff of which real wealth is made, while satisfying the claims inherited from yesterday only allocates this stuff.  (And in a slumping economy the claims can’t be honored anyway.)  </p>
<p>If you accept the cyclical story, and the evidence certainly weighs in its favor, you should not accept another month, much less year after year, of excuses for austerity.</p>

                                <p>Now that the OECD has updated their GDP data for 2010, I thought I should revisit <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/europe-vs-us-who%E2%80%99s-winning.html">the question I asked a few years ago</a>:
<p><strong>Who’s growing faster? The U.S. or Europe?</strong></p>
<p><strong>The answer’s the same</strong> as it was then: <strong>it’s a dead heat.</strong></p>
<p>As I pointed out in that previous post, people love to cherry-pick periods and show how the US has grown so much faster than Europe. (Funny how liberals don’t seem to play this particular game, while conservatives do, quite constantly — usually while going all gooey about people named Reagan and Thatcher.)</p>
<p>The problem is, what they’re saying isn’t true.</p>
<p>Being a curiously curious cat, with an apparently blithe disregard for my own mortality, I went out and looked at the changes in real (inflation-adjusted) GDP per capita over the last forty years. Which I share with you here. Feel free to cherry-pick at will.</p>

<p>In the 40 years between 1970 and 2010, real GDP per capita grew by 112% in the EU15, and 104% in the U.S., for a difference of 8%. (Rounding results in 7% showing here; I chose not the display the extra digit everywhere because it makes the table hard to scan easily.)</p>
<p>It’s also easy to show how much growth rates varied proportionally to each other, by percent (the difference between the US and the EU growth rates, <em>divided by</em> the EU growth rate; that’s “Change difference percent” in the last row above).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-11-at-12.56.58-PM.png"><img title="US Growth Rates Minus EU Growth Rates" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screen-shot-2012-05-11-at-12.56.58-PM-480x258.png" alt="" width="480" height="258"></a></p>
<p>This is a useful comparative, but it can result in showing big (and rhetorically spurious) swings for short periods, swings that smooth out as soon as you look at periods longer than even six or eight years. Scan along the bottom diagonal horizon and you’ll find no shortage of wonderful cherry-pickable moments. Have at it.</p>
<p>But if you’re actually curious about how our different economic models play out over decades — which is what we do or at least should care about — look to the upper right. I’ve highlighted periods greater than twenty and greater than thirty years for your viewing pleasure.</p>
<p>If you can see any kind of long-term pattern anywhere, I’d be delighted to have it pointed it out to me. The average for those upper-right, dark blue cells is -2.6%, meaning that over the long run, U.S. growth shows as 97.4% of the EU15′s — well within the statistical noise.</p>
<p>Also note that the new data for this post — the right column, for 2010 — seems just as random as all the rest. (Though the two bottom cells do provide some juicy numbers, which I’m sure commenters can spin out into an endless and truly fruitless and specious series of arguments. You go girls.)</p>
<p>Speaking of statistical noise, even though this is about the best national-level data we’ve got (we have to use <em>some</em> data to make our judgments), there’s inevitably some messiness in here. So for the curious and/or skeptical, here are the details.</p>
<p>The data is from <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/stats.oecd.org">stats.oecd.org</a>. The OECD — a think-tank <em>cum</em> rich-country club – assembles this data from individual countries’ national accounts. (They just updated US 2010 GDP in March.) They also compile it to some extent, and apply various conversions using best practices.<em> Viz:</em></p>
<p>For comparison to the U.S., I used the OECD’s compiled data for the 15-country European Union (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom). In my previous post I used a simple average of GDP/capita for non-English-speaking Western European countries (excluding Luxembourg and Norway, for instance, because of size, banking, and oil). I think that selection provided a better representative comparison group, but the OECD does a better job of agglomerating the data than I could do. I’ll just say that judging from my non-systematic journeys through the data over the years, changing country choices doesn’t change the top-line results much at all. Please feel free to prove me wrong.</p>
<p> I chose GDP/Capita as a measure because it’s a pretty good big-picture yardstick of prosperity, and removes one key confuting variable from the comparison: population growth over the decades. GDP has lots of things wrong with it (it <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/home-work-25-of-gdp.html">only counts remunerated work</a>, for instance, which gives the U.S. a notable advantage in the comparison, because Europeans have more free time for productive but unremunerated “home work”), but it’s hard to name a better big-picture measure for which we have consistently compiled data for lots of countries, going back four decades.</p>
<p>All the foreign numbers are converted to US dollars based on “purchasing power parity.” This adjusts for different purchasing power in different countries, in an effort to impart people’s relative buying power in those countries. It’s not a perfect method, by any means. But just <a href="http://www.economist.com/search/apachesolr_search/big%20mac%20index">using market exchange rates isn’t either</a>. Since I’m curious about standards of living in the two areas, PPPs made more sense than exchange rates.</p>
<p>Adjusting for inflation — especially in different countries — is also an imperfect science. Many European countries, for instance, don’t use “hedonic adjustment” to correct for massively increasing computer value per euro or dollar. (This makes those countries’ growth rates look worse.) The U.S. and several other European countries do. I’m not a <a href="http://shadowstats.com/">ShadowStats</a> fan (<a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/24/a-quick-note-on-inflation/">CPI tracks too closely with the Billion Price Index</a>, for instance, to give much credit to their rather wild claims), but I do realize that adjusting for inflation requires holding up your thumb and squinting some. Again, though, if we want to compare countries’ prosperity over decades, we need to talk about real buying power as opposed to nominal units of currency.</p>
<p>Those were my choices. If you think there are better ones, and that they would change these results significantly, please <em>go do it yourself</em> and report back. I’m wildly curious. <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?attachment_id=5397">Here’s</a> my spreadsheet. I’m happy to help anyone figure out how to use it (the Data Tables are especially neat), and also how to navigate the OECD’s stats.</p>
<p>I should end by pointing out the fact that commenters will undoubtedly raise: the EU remains way behind the U.S. in (at least) this measure of prosperity. Europeans buy 20-30% less stuff per person than Americans. After catching up <em>fast</em> (and predictably) in the decades following WWII, they’ve been stuck at about the same level (relative to us) for forty years. Standard economic <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergence_(economics)">convergence theory</a> suggests that they should have continued that catch-up. But that’s a topic for <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/bleg-why-hasnt-europe-caught-up.html">another post</a>.</p>

<p>Ten tax tricks (non-rich need not apply)</p>
<p> Back on tax day in April, Bloomberg.com ran a good story on the tax tricks the rich can use to reduce, defer or avoid altogether federal income taxation. Jesse Drucker, How <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-04-17/how-to-pay-no-taxes-10-strategies-used-by-the-rich">to Pay No Taxes: Ten Strategies Used by the Rich</a>, Bloomberg.com (Apr. 17, 2012).</p>
<p>As Drucker notes, the very very wealthy at the top of the income distribution have made out extraordinarily well in the last decade as to amount of taxes paid.<br />
<blockquote>For the 400 U.S. taxpayers with the highest adjusted gross income, the effective federal income tax rate—what they actually pay—fell from almost 30 percent in 1995 to just over 18 percent in 2008, according to the Internal Revenue Service. And for the approximately 1.4 million people who make up the top 1 percent of taxpayers, the effective federal income tax rate dropped from 29 percent to 23 percent in 2008. It may seem too fantastic to be true, but the top 400 end up paying a lower rate than the next 1,399,600 or so.</p></blockquote>
<p>They don&#8217;t even necessarily have to cheat to do it. They just use the tried and true tax reduction methods built into the system for their benefit&#8211;like &#8220;monetizing&#8221; their wealth through borrowings that they don&#8217;t pay back in their lifetimes, but are paid out of the estate (which can sell stocks with the step up in basis resulting in no taxes).</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s because those figures fail to include the additional income that’s generated by many sophisticated tax-avoidance strategies. Several of those techniques involve some variation of complicated borrowings that never get repaid, netting the beneficiaries hundreds of millions in tax-free cash. </p></blockquote>
<p>The article lists ten common ways the rich avoid taxes. <br />(After the jump)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />1. The no-sale sale (borrowing against stock, combined with puts and calls, so that the rich guy can either pay back the cash or hand over shares, years after the sale is actually conducted. (Drucker notes that Philip Anshultz used one of these deals and ended up with the tax court saying he owed $94 million in back taxes. But the deals are still going strong.)</p>
<p>2. the skyscraper shuffle (using tiered partnerships to borrow against partnership property, move the loan into a subsidiary and then distribute the subsidiary to liquidate a partner, letting him cash out of a real estate partnership and avoid taxation, retaining ownership of the entity with the cash and deferring taxes indefinitely)</p>
<p>3. the estate tax eliminator (leaving stock earnings to kids and avoiding the estate tax with a GRAT)</p>
<p>4. the estate freeze (using an intentionally defective grantor trust and debt to freeze the value of an estate&#8211;and avoid estate taxes on future appreciation&#8211;by moving assets out of the estate tax free for the benefit of beneficiaries and benefiting from valuation discounts due to the use of the trust)</p>
<p>5. The option option (receiving options rather than shares as compensation so that the tax bill won&#8217;t be due til the options are exercised)</p>
<p>6. the bountiful loss (purchasing identical underwater shares and using puts and calls to protect against any risk of further loss, and then selling the old shares to realize the loss&#8211;with just enough of a time window to avoid the wash sale rule&#8211;while retaining the same property in the form of the new shares)</p>
<p>7. the friendly partner (selling real estate by forming a partnership with the buyer, taking out a loan collateralized by the property, and ultimately distributing the cash to the seller who retains an interest in the partnership)</p>
<p>8. the big payback (buying various life insurance products that completely escape t income tax and, if owned by the appropriate type of trust, also the estate tax)</p>
<p>9. IRS Monte Carlo (converting traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs, especially in sets so that you can take advantage of the 21-month &#8220;change your mind&#8221; period selectively as it benefits you)</p>
<p>10. the venti (having a chunk of your big CEO compensation paid through a deferred compensation plan where earnings grow tax-deferred for years or decades).<br />What&#8217;s the moral of this tale? That Congress could easily stop every one of these tax avoidance schemes if it wanted to. And it should want to, so that the ultra-rich don&#8217;t continue to have access to schemes that allow them to avoid taxation that are simply not available to ordinary people.<br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/ten-tax-tricks-non-rich-need-not-try.html" title="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/ten-tax-tricks-non-rich-need-not-try.html">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/ten-tax-tricks-non-rich-need-not-try.html</a></p>

<p>Libertarians and Privacy  </p>
<p>Over at EconLog, David Henderson berates a fellow libertarian  <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/05/does_facebook_r.html"> on the difference between Facebook at the Census</a>.   <br />
<blockquote>But let&#8217;s grant, for the sake of this discussion, that FB is quite contemptuous of privacy and that the Census Bureau is less so. Here&#8217;s the difference. <ital>Every single person who signs up with Facebook does so voluntarily.</ital> If FB had committed to guarding your privacy, then it would be breeching a contract by doing so. But I&#8217;ve never seen FB make that commitment.   The U.S. Census Bureau, by contrast, uses the threat of force to get its information. That&#8217;s a pretty big difference. It&#8217;s not one that I would expect, say, the <ital>New York Times</ital>, to point out. But it is a distinction that I would have expected from someone who calls himself a bleeding heart <ital>libertarian</ital>.</p></blockquote>
<p>A lot of libertarians seem to think there&#8217;s a distinction between when the government engages in an activity and when a private sector entity engages in the same activity.  But a thought experiment is in order.  Consider&#8230;  it isn&#8217;t technologically infeasible for me, much less an organization with a lot more resources than I have, to do any of the following things from public property &#8211; say, across the street from David Henderson&#8217;s home:   </p>
<p>1.  Monitor every conversation that occurs in a home and parse each of those conversations for information <br />2.  Monitor comings and goings into and out of a home <br />3.  Monitor internet usage, and potentially, phone calls made and received in the home  <br />4.  Monitor where each individual is in the home at any given moment and to some extent, what that individual is doing.   <br />5.  Monitor precisely how much electricity is going into the home (and no, this does not require access to or a view of the meter or any contact in the electric company).   <br />6.  Monitor where every individual who lives in the home goes when they are not in the home <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Essentially, all it takes to do all of these things is time, a bit of determination, and maybe $5,000 in equipment.  I don&#8217;t even think any of these these activities is illegal if done by a private party, except to some extent, number 3, and, in some states, number 1 if the monitor makes a recording of the conversations.   (And realistically, guys like David Henderson don&#8217;t exactly like the government limiting what private citizens can and cannot do, do they?) Number 4 depends in part on weather conditions.     </p>
<p>Additionally, the costs of monitoring is just coming down.  It won&#8217;t be long before one could surreptitiously keep track of a lot of aspects of a person&#8217;s health remotely, and without their consent.     </p>
<p>Now, an organization doing all of the above does not require the consent or even the knowledge of the monitored to do the monitoring, unless one assumes that failure to deploy expensive countermeasures is equivalent to consent.  Note that for the monitoring to occur, there is no need whatsoever for the monitored party to have any relationship at all with the monitor, and threats of violence are completely unnecessary.    </p>
<p>The only thing going on is the collection of information which Mr. Henderson feels would have been a bad thing it been done by the government.  It will be interesting to see where libertarians of Mr. Henderson&#8217;s ilk go in the coming years.  Will they fall on the side of &#8220;a private party&#8217;s information is private unless he/she has chosen to share that information with third parties, whether explicitly or implicitly through transactions&#8221; or will they laud the collection of said information as a triumph of the free market?  My guess is the latter, simply because the former would require government intervention, and the government is always evil as far as some folks are concerned.     </p>
<p>Meanwhile, collectively, the rest of us will try to steer a sensible middle ground &#8211; determining what is permissible and what is &#8220;too far&#8221; and setting limits through legislation.</p>

<p><strong>Inequality on the Island</strong></p>
<p>Your island has 1000 people. 500 are working age, 500 are children or elderly and can’t do much.  That’s normal, and not a problem.</p>
<p>The 500, working together, easily produce enough food and stuff for 5000 people, while also supporting the 500 young, old and disabled.  In fact, the working 500 are so productive that in good times they have plenty of time to create music and art, write books, do research, and explore the sea, the land and the heavens.  And when members of the 500 grow old, there are youngsters ready and willing to take their place.</p>
<p>With 5000 livings floating around, no-one expects each person to have 5 livings.  Some will always have a bit more, others a bit less. But this variability can go too far.</p>
<p>By 2007 on the island, 200 people control 4250 of the 5000 livings,and of that group ten people control 1730 livings.  One of the 200 has 615 livings all to himself.</p>
<p>The other 800 people on the island have 750 livings to share, 0.94 each.  Half of these people are not workers, and need to be supported by the remaining 400.</p>
<p>These 400, subsisting on less than a living each, produce 80%of the island’s economy of 5000 livings, or 10 livings each.  In return they receive 1.88 livings with which to support themselves and one dependent.</p>
<p>There’s your inequality.  How does it look to you?</p>
