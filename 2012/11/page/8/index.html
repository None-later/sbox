                                <p>By Jeff McCord of <a href="http://www.the-investor-advocate.com/"><i>The Investor Advocate</i></a></p>
<p>USA: History’s Largest Free Port for Financial Freebooters?</p>
<p>The term “freebooter,” derived from the Dutch vrijbuiter, means one who openly steals property. Once freebooters sailed the coasts of the Carolinas, Florida and Caribbean isles from free ports such as Port Royal, Jamaica, taking what they wished with little or no consequences because Jamaican Colonial authorities granted them immunity.</p>
<p>Today, a federal appeals court may determine if the United States has become the largest such free port for swindlers in modern history. At issue is the Supreme Court’s controversial 2010 decision (Morrison v. National Australia Bank), that provides immunity from investor accountability to off-shore shysters preying on Americans as well as on-shore fraudsters plundering foreigners as long as the fraudulent transactions take place outside the USA or involve securities listed overseas. Many experts believe Morrison also provides immunity from SEC civil and federal criminal actions.</p>
<p>“Political” High Court Decision to Curtail Investor Rights May Also Free Criminals<br />
<blockquote>With Morrison, the Supreme Court “cavalierly overturned 40 years of precedent,” says former SEC commissioner and Brooklyn Law professor Robert S. Karmel. She says there was no compelling reason for the Supreme Court to even hear the case and onlyu did so to “further its campaign to limit [investor fraud] class actions to the extent possible”</p></blockquote>
<p>See <a href="http://www.newyorklawjournal.com/PubArticleNY.jsp?id=1202560166548&#038;Should_Morrison_Be_Overturned&#038;slreturn=20120923095758">Justce Antonin Scalia’s majority [Morrison] opinion is blatantly political&#8230;NY law journal</a></p>
<p>Justice Scalia’s majority opinion may also be so broadly worded that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit may be compelled to conclude that no prosecution &#8212; civil or criminal &#8212; of wrongdoers peddling foreign securities is possible within the United States. Among other unfortunate and unforeseeable consequences, such a ruling would overturn the criminal convictions of two flamboyant “old school” fraudsters: Alberto Vilar, who falsely claimed to be a Castro-fleeing Cuban émigré but did have an investment operation in Panama (an old pirate haunt); and, Ross Mandell, a broker of questionable repute who resides in Boca Raton (the new Port Royal?).</p>

<p>Flamboyant Convicted Swindlers May Be Off the Hook</p>
<p>First, let’s meet Ross H. Mandell, a Boca domiciled broker with a regulatory challenged past – he was suspended from trading on the New York Stock Exchange &#8212; and million dollar life-style, the New York Times reported. A unanimous federal jury convicted him of running an old-fashioned “boiler room” operation in Florida to defraud mostly British investors by using fraudulent sales pitches to flog questionable stocks on a London exchange. Although, he allegedly defrauded Americans as well, his lawyers contend the statute of limitations had run out on those crimes. <br />New York Times columnist Floyd Norris recently described Mr. Mandell:<br />
<blockquote>“The government says the money he gained from defrauding investors paid for ‘first-class flights, five-star hotel suites, expensive meals, adult entertainment and personal spending,’ even though his firm was losing money. It says some of the money was used for ‘work done on Mandell’s penthouse apartment at Trump U.N. Plaza’ in Manhattan.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Let’s now consider the case of Mr. Alberto Vilar, a high-profile broker-dealer who was found guilty in federal court of stealing millions of customers’ funds. Listed by Forbes in 2005 as among the 400 wealthiest men in America, Mr. Vilar had assets believed to total nearly $1 billion. He was an opera lover and a very generous, well-known patron. Despite his love of the performance art, Mr. Vilar reportedly embezzled $2 million from star tenor Placido Domingo, in an incident unrelated to his securities conviction. See: <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/02/13/060213fa_fact_stewart">New Yorker</a></p>
<p>In an appeal citing Morrison, Mr. Vilar’s attorneys say he should be released from incarceration at a federal facility and his conviction overturned because the transactions and investments at issue were allegedly structured at the defendant’s Panamanian registered broker-dealer, rather than within the United States. In a sign some believe signals that the federal appeals court may agree, Mr. Vilar was ordered released on bail pending the appellate decision. See: <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-02/amerindo-cofounders-vilar-and-tanaka%20win-release-on-bail.html">Bloomberg&#8230;amerindo cofounders vilar and tanaka-wi release-on-bail</a></p>
<p>Foreign-Based Frauds of Petty Criminals and Too-Big to Fail Banks</p>
<p>These are simply two recent fraud cases that may be turned upside down by Morrison. And, although the alleged crimes were egregious, these were relatively small scale transgressions when measured against the off-shore connivances of too-big-to-fail banks that can cause multi-billion dollar investor losses. Think Goldman Sachs and its’ allegedly fraudulent sub-prime mortgage derived collateralized debt obligations structured in London, but sold to U.S. investors. </p>
<p>Whether petty criminals or clever multi-national corporate schemers, such wrongdoers may have been dealt a “get out of jail free” card by the Supreme Court. They have also been immunized from accountability to their victims.<br />Congress Should Take Action before Jolly Roger flies beside Stars and Stripes<br />Many agree with former SEC commissioner Karmel (cited above) that it is time for Congress to overturn Morrison. Salvator J. Graziano, Esq, a partner at Bernstein Litowitz Berger &#038; Grossman, LLP, president of the National Association of Shareholder and Commercial Attorneys and former Assistant District Attorney for Manhattan agrees. He summed-up the wider repercussions of Morrison in calling for Congress to take action: </p>
<blockquote><p>“With Morrison, the Supreme Court unwittingly has allowed the U.S. to become a safe haven for fraud so long as the securities at issue are listed abroad. On behalf of investors at home and abroad, we ask Congress to over-turn the unfortunate Morrison decision by restoring the rights of action of defrauded investors and clarifying the authority of federal regulators and the Department of Justice.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Congress should act before the Jolly Roger flies beside the Stars and Stripes over Wall Street and Boca Raton.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It is now clear that the calculations Nate Silver made just before the election were a better guide to what was about to happen than Joe Scarborough&#8217;s gut or the voices in Peggy Noonan&#8217;s head.  This is not a high bar to clear.  Many other poll aggregators made similar predictions.</p>
<p>However, Silver&#8217;s performance this year has been amazing (again).  It isn&#8217;t because the networks still haven&#8217;t decided if his expected Obama electoral votes forecast was too high or too low (they will when they call Florida) its that they haven&#8217;t yet concluded that the forecasts he made in July were noticeably different from the outcome (they will when they finally call Florida for Obama). </p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cn5-u6NwBsI/UJp-mPHeEuI/AAAAAAAAAU4/M2ocZUKX100/s1600/silverstandard.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="397" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cn5-u6NwBsI/UJp-mPHeEuI/AAAAAAAAAU4/M2ocZUKX100/s400/silverstandard.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Silver stresses that he thinks it is important to make predictions about the future &#8212; that predicting on Monday what will happen Tuesday is of no use for people trying to decide what to do in July (say how aggressively to use tax shelters July 2012 or whether to invest in bottled water, canned food and ammunition July 2004).</p>
<p>The fact that he got it right the day before the end is, well better than cable babbler standard anyway.  The fact that he got it right without having to constantly massively change his forecasts due to new information is much more impressive. </p>
<p>Sticking to a prediction is always possible if one is stubborn (or strategically boastful).  Getting it right in the end is possible if tons of information are available at the end.  To stick to a prediction of the distant future and get it right one must have precognition.  To make predictions which change as little as Silver&#8217;s did and get it right one must be on to something.</p>

                                <p>Here in suburban New Jersey, we are just now getting power back throughout town. (As of yesterday—remember, remember, the Fifth of November—we were the town in Essex County that had the least restored houses.) A lot of progress today, with teams from Texas and Florida among those called in (which presumably left the NJ teams to deal with the major issues down by the shore).</p>
<p>By a fluke of (mis)transcription, my work number is getting calls from the Huntington (NY) School District.  Huntington is (per Google Maps) fifty-six (56) miles away, around the middle of Lon Gisland.</p>
<p>One of the things that has been happening is that the towns are in parallel: my childrens’s schools have both been closed since last Monday.  So has the Huntington School District. For the past two days, on two separate telephones, I have gotten a call saying, in short, “We have no power. No school tomorrow.”</p>
<p>Today, the calls were different.</p>
<p>For here, the grade school is open tomorrow.  For the middle school, power is still not restored, but alternatives have been found.</p>
<p>For Huntington, the message went roughly like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Power has now been restored to the school.  However, we are now anticipating that the high winds from tomorrow’s Nor’easter will reach our area before the scheduled dismissal time tomorrow.  Given the danger from trees and power lines that have not yet been repaired from Sandy, we are going to remain closed tomorrow.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jersey Jazzman asked if his annual evaluation would include a “<a href="http://jerseyjazzman.blogspot.com/2012/10/will-my-teacher-rating-have-sandy.html">Sandy variable</a>.”  All the talk from Lon Gislanders has been about how Sandy impacted the South Shore and how tomorrow’s Nor’easter will impact the North Shore.</p>
<p>Some areas of the Northeast were less affected.  Some are recovering.  And some—such as the middle of Lon Gisland—are getting the worst of both worlds.</p>
<p>Just to relate this to finance:  I really wouldn’t go long any insurance companies (or even reinsurance companies) just yet.</p>

<blockquote><p>A remarkably important and persuasive paper that calls into question the need for “reforming” Medicare has not gotten the attention it warrants. “<a href="http://www.bancaditalia.it/studiricerche/convegni/atti/fiscal_sustainability/session_3/Follette%20Sheiner.pdf">An Examination of Health-Spending Growth In The United States: Past Trends And Future Prospects</a>” (hat tip nathan) by Glenn Follette and Louise Sheiner looks at the model used by the Congressional Budgetary Office to estimate long term health care cost increases. Bear in mind that this model is THE driver of virtually all forecasts of future budget deficits.<br />This paper, although written in typically anodyne economese, is devastating in the range and nature of its criticisms.</p></blockquote>
<p>The election for Senator in MA is close and takes a lot of time, so discussion of this topic has received short shrift till later, but reponses are in the works.  I have taken the liberty of lifting comments from that thread at <i>Naked Capitalism</i> from run75441, Yves, and reader river.</p>

After all of us experiencing this exact same thing play itself out in the housing market, I can only imagine how it would play itself out in healthcare. For the last few years, most of my raises have gone to healthcare cost increases, and I would expect that to continue, but after a while, we would switch to a catestrophic insurance program and just not use the services that they are providing. As the costs keep going up, more and more people would stop getting any insurance. Bankrupcies, and cost pressures on medical facilities will start to hit the practitioners (if all of the antelopes are starving, the lions will soon starve themselves).<br /><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/fed-budgetary-experts-demolish-cbo-health-cost-model-the-lynchpin-of-budget-hysteria.html?replytocom=890411#respond">Reply</a>

The goal is to get both down to 1% through a series of cost initiatives led by Medicare. Obama has pledged to allow Medicare to begin negotiating healthcare industry services.<br />The MLR was put in place to control the amount of premiums spent on insurance administration. Within the MLR are risk factors based upon the youngest and healthiest insuree, 150% for smokers (too low), and up to 300% for the elderly. There is also a maximum you will pay as a percentage of income.<br />I had a discussion today with Maggie Mahar on the growing costs and the attached article. I am sure she would not mind my posting some of her thoughts:<br />“It seems to me that any attempt to forecast that far out is nuts. Wall Street analysts don’t try to predict a corporation’s finance out more than 3 years– maybe 5– and that’s just one corporations.<br />They’re talking about healthcare spending– a huge chunk of the economy.They also assume that the aging of America means higher spending.<br />A number of countries in Europe that have populations that are significantly older than ours have shown that just isn’t true. (I’m thinking of Germany &#038; Sweden in particular).<br />We’ve always been somewhat hysterical about “What will happen when the Baby Boomers Grow Old!!” We’ll handle it because we have to.<br />We already know that 1/3 of Medicare dollars are wasted. Cut even 2/3 of that waste, and problem solved. Getting away from fee for service, more efficient systems, refusing to pay for preventable errors, reducing what medicare pays for services we know are not terribly effective; greater use of nurse practitioners, less screening, . . . etc.”</li>

                                <p>The US Senate election in MA is between Senator Scott Brown and challenger Elizabeth Warren.  While there has been some discussion on financial concerns, there hasn&#8217;t been a lot to report of substance during the election campaign for us to post.  One of the tweets making the rounds is what it would be like to be sitting on the <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/public/">Senate Banking etc. Committee</a>, members who blocked Warren&#8217;s consideration as the director of the newly created  <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/initiatives/Pages/cfpb.aspx">Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (CFPB)</a> if Warren takes her seat at the table.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/the-false-dodd-frank-narrative-occupy-wall-street-attacks-huge-hot-money-loophole-in-the-law.html">Matt Stoller</a> writes at <i>Naked Capitalism</i> on whether financial regulation has teeth and addresses real problems.</p>
<blockquote><p>Proponents of Dodd-Frank have an incentive to argue the law is a tough crack-down on Wall Street. It’s a core part of Barack Obama’s narrative, that he bailed out the banks, but then did what FDR did in the 1930s with a series of tight regulations. Of course, it was immediately obvious that Dodd-Frank was an afterthought of the Bush/Obama administrations, that the real policy framework involved three key fights – the Fannie/Freddie bailouts under the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (the so-called bazooka law), TARP, and the reappointment of Ben Bernanke. These fights were supplemented by Eric Holder’s <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/09/marcy-wheeler-lanny-breuer-admits-that-economists-have-convinced-him-not-to-indict-corporations.html">decision to give legal forbearance</a> to Wall Street executives, to not prosecute for rigging the CDO market or any number of illegalities in the foreclosure space.</p>

<p>After this radical consolidation of banking <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/the-false-dodd-frank-narrative-occupy-wall-street-attacks-huge-hot-money-loophole-in-the-law.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+NakedCapitalism+%28naked+capitalism%29#">power<img src="http://images.intellitxt.com/ast/adTypes/icon1.png"></a> in the hands of bailed out Too Big To Fail institutions, the Obama administration went to work on Dodd-Frank, which was essentially a <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/07/matt-stoller-dodd-frank-made-no-structural-changes-to-banking-system.html">2000 page mash note</a> to regulators saying “please don’t let that crisis happen again, it was awkward’. And now the evidence is beginning to trickle out that Dodd-Frank is a nothingburger. As Yves has already show regarding <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/11/the-false-dodd-frank-narrative-on-bank-profits-no-honey-obama-did-not-shrink-the-banks2.html">bank size and profits</a>, Dodd-Frank, unlike TARP, is not particularly relevant to trends in the financial services industry. We will keep hammering on the flaws in Dodd-Frank as the opportunities arise.</p></blockquote>

Dean Baker (and many others) of course has championed taking a more critical look at this set of issues for years.  But most readers know that &#8220;free market&#8221; is an election slogan and a <strike>metaphorica</strike>l  apocryphal story line rather than  something real for guiding either private companies or governments policies and rules.  On the other hand, that is the language used and something I hear from people in a non-critical way.</div>
<p>Copyright and patent rights need strong government to enforce the rules, and distort &#8220;pricing&#8221; mechanisms.   Yet it does not seem to be enough to cajole people into making a list of possible exceptions and then applying the rule of  &#8220;free&#8221;&#8230;if open to exception, where does it stop?  Often the question puts people to sleep, but is part of the bread and butter of real multinational companies.  And then enforcement falls to whom?  Who votes based on such details?  Trade policy hasn&#8217;t had traction for years.  </p>

Mr. Kirtsaeng contends that the law allows him to resell the textbooks because he, family members and friends bought them legally and a principle called the first-sale doctrine, announced by the Supreme Court in a 1908 <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&#038;vol=210&#038;invol=339">ruling</a> and codified into law by Congress, says copyright owners cannot control the distribution and pricing of works, like books, after the initial sale.</p>
<p>But the Copyright Act <a href="http://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/document/John_Wiley__Sons_v_Kirtsaeng_654_F3d_210_99_USPQ2d_1641_2d_Cir_20">prohibits</a> anyone from importing into the United States copyrighted works without the copyright holder’s approval. That provision would be seriously limited if copies of a work made abroad could be resold by importers in this country without constraint.</p>
<p>This case requires a difficult interpretation of the Copyright Act, but that is made easier by understanding the intent of Congress when it revised the law in 1976. It did so to broaden protection against unauthorized imports of copyrighted works by so-called gray-market sellers, and to make easier the kind of market segmentation by geography and price that Mr. Kirtsaeng’s resales subverted. With segmentation, book publishers can offer cheaper editions of their works in less-developed countries, without concern that those copies will be resold in the United States and unfairly undercut sales here. </p></blockquote>

<p> GOP didn&#8217;t like the study on impact of tax cuts on economic growth</p>
<p> The Congressional Research Service has long been respected as a non-partisan research organization that does in-depth studies as requested by Congress.  But when those non-partisan studies produce results that don&#8217;t jive with the right-wing mythology about tax cuts as the cure-all for slow economic growth, the right goes on the attack.</p>
<p>On September 14, 2012, the Congressional Research Service released a report by Tom Hungerford on the impact of tax cuts on economic growth.  Tom Hungerford,<a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/PDF/0915taxesandeconomy.pdf">Taxes and the Economy: An economic analysis of top tax rates since 1945</a> (CRS, Sept. 14, 2012). </p>
<p>Advocates of lower tax rates argue that reduced rates would increase economic growth, increase saving and investment, and boost productivity (increase the economic pie). Proponents of higher tax rates argue that higher tax revenues are necessary for debt reduction, that tax rates on the rich are too low (i.e., they violate the Buffett rule), and that higher tax rates on the rich would moderate increasing income inequality (change how the economic pie is distributed). This report attempts to clarify whether or not there is an association between the tax rates of the highest income taxpayers and economic growth.</p>
<p>This was an update of a report by Jane Gravelle and Donald J. Marples, <em>Tax Rates and Economic<em> Growth, CRS (</em></em>CRS Report R42111) and so was not an attempt to rewrite that report but to look only at the top tax rates.  </p>
<p>The Hungerford study didn&#8217;t find a correlation between lowering top tax rates and economic growth, but it did find one between lowering top tax rates and increasing inequality. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The share of income accruing to the top 0.1% of U.S. families increased from 4.2% in 1945 to 12.3% by 2007 before falling to 9.2% due to the 2007-2009 recession. The evidence does not suggest necessarily a relationship between tax policy withregard to the top tax rates and the size of the economic pie, but there may be a relationship to how the economic pie is sliced. Id.</p>
<p>That is in fact what one would expect, and increased inequality has its own harmful effects on the economy.<br />On September 17,  the Heritage Foundation squawked about the Hungerford study.  See <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2012/09/17/congressional-research-service-wrongly-implies-lower-tax-rates-dont-strengthen-economy/">Congressional Research Service Wrongly Implies Lower Tax Rates Don&#8217;t Strengthen Economy</a>, Heritage Foundation (Sept. 17, 2012).  Heritage acknowledges that the Hungerford report looks at a &#8220;slew of time periods&#8221; but it claims that the &#8220;simplistic correlations prove nothing.&#8221;  Id.  It suggests that since no two timeframes can be exactly the same, the correlations are meaningless.  If only the study had been tweaked the way the Heritage Foundation would have tweaked it, it would have supported Heritage&#8217;s position that lower tax rates on the top produce economic growth, it suggests.</p>
<p>But this is itself a simplistic analysis. The complaint that the paper didn&#8217;t take all the variables into account is a red herring.  The study offered a simple correlation study&#8211;looking just at the tax rates and economic growth, does a pattern emerge upholding the GOP view that tax cuts stimulate growth or not.  The answer is &#8220;not&#8221;.  Now, there are lots of other variables that could be considered&#8211;global warming, military involvement, and decaying infrastructure are all likely relevant to how we should spend our resources and likely also have a significant impact on the economy.  But self-serving assumptions about the &#8220;dynamic&#8221; effect of tax cuts are not.  For the broader view on tax rate analyses, Hungerford refers the reader to the 2011 Gravelle paper.  The problem with economic analyses in the market fundamentalist approach is that the answer can be manipulated by tweaking the selected data points, the time lag between policy and a change point, the way the discount rate is chosen, or whatever.   The Heritage position confuses savings and investment, missing the point that when interest rates are already down, savings can&#8217;t have much impact in reducing interest rates to make investment more attractive. </p>
<p>The  outcome of the right&#8217;s attack on a CRS study that came to a result it didn&#8217;t like is worrisome.  Instead of noting the limited goal of the paper (to see if there were correlations over time of tax rates and economic growth), the CRS yielded to pressure and pulled the study. See Jonathan Weisman, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/business/questions-raised-on-withdrawal-of-congressional-research-services-report-on-tax-rates.html?emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y">Nonpartisan Report Withdrawn after GOP Protest</a>, New York Times (Nov. 1, 2012). The withdrawal was counter to the recommendation of the service&#8217;s economic leaders. That says that CRS is vulnerable to pressure from those who want a study to show a particular outcome.  And that is not good.</p>

                                <p>Lifting some more from Angry Bear Robert Waldmann&#8217;s more personal musings at <i>Stochastic thoughts</i>:</p>
<p>Friday, November 02, 2012<br />I know I will regret this. I&#8217;m not drunk enough to do this yet (8:54 PM)<br />Now I am (9:30 PM)</p>
<p>If not specified I predict that the same caucus will keep the Senate seat (so for Connecticut the Democratic Caucus not the Connecticut for Lieberman party)</p>
<p>Senate</p>
<p>Maine&#8230;             King (I) who will caucus with Democrats<br />Massachusetts&#8230;Warren (D)<br />Virginia&#8230;           Kaine (D)<br />Florida &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Nelson (D)<br />Indiana &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Donnelly (D)<br />Missouri&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; McCaskill (D)<br />Wisconsin &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Baldwin (D)<br />Nebraska &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Fischer (R)<br />N Dakota &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Berg (R)<br />Montana &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Rehberg (R)<br />Arizona &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Carmona (D)<br />Nevada &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Heller (R)</p>
<p>Mostly I just predict the candidate who is ahead in the average poll will win.  For 6 races this margin is tiny and I think:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Virginia:  Some averages show this closer than close.  An important reason is a Roanoke College poll which shows Allen (R) up by 5.  Roanoke doesn&#8217;t poll outside of Virginia and doesn&#8217;t have much of a track record. Their numbers bounce around a lot.  I guess that they don&#8217;t do much demographic weighting so the sampling error is equal to the stated sampling error (most pollsters weight to make their sample of adults match census data on some dimensions reducing sampling error then ignore this when making cautious estimates of standard errors).  So I weight them less nudging Kaine into a lead. </p>
<p>In Wisconsin again the averages are very close with Baldwin very slightly ahead.   There are some pollsters which I suspect of overestimating Republican vote (Wenzel Strategies and Rasmussen).  This is enough to make me guess that she will slightly outperform the average poll which implies Senator Baldwin.</p>
<p>N Dakota is very close.  Without looking at polls I would guess a Republican is more likely to win.  The basically tied polling doesn&#8217;t move my posterior appreciably from this prior.</p>
<p>Montana is very close.  In spite of my gross error in 2004, I still have some sense that undecideds break against the incumbent (Tester (D)).  Also many polls name the libertarian.  I think slightly more people say they will vote for a no hope of winning third party candidate than actually throw their votes away and I assume that their second choice is Rehberg. </p>
<p>Carmona is slightly behind in Arizona.  I am counting on Hispanic citizens who are even more reluctant to talk to pollsters in English than to vote.</p>
<p>Nevada is close too, but not close enough for me to bet on the hard to poll Hispanics effect and the strength of trade unions and Democratic turn out the vote efforts.</p>
<p>New Senate guess is same as the old Senate with 51 Democrats 2 independents and 47 Republicans. </p>
<p>Update: ooops that&#8217;s embarrassing.  New Senate guess Democrats gain one with 52 Democrats 2 independents and 46 Republicans.  I see I agree with Nate Silver except on Indiana and Arizona.  I am quite confident about Indiana.  Silver&#8217;s model doesn&#8217;t consider whether there has been a big event like a candidate saying rape babies are gifts from God.  So the Howie DePauwe poll showing Donnelly ahead by 11 is just tossed in the smoothed average.  I am not at all confident about Arizona (or for that matter Montana where Silver gives Tester (D) a 33% chance).<br />/update</p>
<p>Sanders  will remain a more reliable Democrat than any Democrat.  King will cause the caucus about as much heart ache as Lieberman.    If my guesses are right, the Democratic caucus will move left with conservadem Ben Nelson gone, centrists Conrad and Tester gone, liberal Warren added, and mainstream Democrats added (2 replacing outgoing mainstream Democrats).  The Republican caucus would move to the right with moderate Snowe sometimes pseudo moderate Brown and not as extreme as Cruz anyway Hutchison gone.  So I guess the Senate will be less harmonious and more partisan hard as that is to imagine.</p>
<p>Warning.  My predictions are almost always wrong (my 2010 Senate predictions were correct).</p>
