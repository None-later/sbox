<blockquote>What Uncle Sam has given to the earnings of companies like Citigroup, AIG, and Ford he soon might take away.
<p>President Barack Obama has said, most recently during last month&#8217;s presidential debates, that the 35% U.S. corporate tax rate should be cut. That would mean lower tax bills for many companies. But it also could prompt large write-downs by Citigroup, AIG, Ford and other companies that hold piles of &#8220;deferred tax assets,&#8221; or DTAs.<br />After posting big losses, these companies have tax credits and deductions they can use to defray future tax bills, thus providing a boost to earnings. But a tax-rate reduction means some of those credits and deductions, counted as assets on the balance sheet, would be worth less, since lower tax bills would mean fewer opportunities to use them before they expire. That would force the companies to write down their value, resulting in charges against earnings.</p>
<p>&#8230;<br />&#8230;the company believes tax change should &#8220;include transition measures that mitigate impacts and avoid negative unintended results&#8221; for companies that based their planning on the current tax system.</p>

<p> Posterity</p>
<p> I think you have to go back to Bob Dole in 1996 to find a Republican nominee for for President whose signature accomplishment wouldn&#8217;t be repudiated by most members of his own party in November 2012. The 2000 and 2004 nominee is best known for turning a surplus into a deficit (although most current Republicans approve of the way he did it, cutting tax rates, increasing military spending, and launching two wars) and was kept discretely away from the last Republican National Convention. The 2008 nominee is best known for the McCain-Feingold Act, and the 2012 nominee, of course, will forever be tied to Romneycare. As to Bob Dole in 1996, well, I couldn&#8217;t remember him having any signature issues so I googled him. Google took me <a href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Bob_Dole.htm">here</a> but I still didn&#8217;t find anything that really said &#8220;Bob Dole&#8221; to me.</p>
<p>Sure, he agreed or disagreed with all sorts of things, but he wasn&#8217;t the champion of any and there wasn&#8217;t anything he was really known for. The 1988 and 1992 nominee, George Herbert Walker Bush, these days is best remembered for ending the first war in Iraq without taking out Saddam Hussein or taking Baghdad and for &#8220;read my lips, no new taxes.&#8221; Breaking that promise got him excoriated by Republicans. Reagan seems to be the most recent Republican nominee for President of the US who has a signature issue that remains popular with Republicans today. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As the co-author of  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Presidents-Measure-Issues-ebook/dp/B0041IXRWA/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?ie=UTF8&#038;m=AG56TWVU5XWC2&#038;qid=1337806400&#038;sr=1-1">Presimetrics</a>,  a book on Presidents, their policies, and the effect of those policies; I&#8217;ve talked to a lot of people of all stripes about Presidents, and Republicans today simply don&#8217;t seem to approve of most former Republican presidents, or at least their policies. Before Reagan was Ford, best remembered for pardoning Nixon and Whip Inflation Now. Nixon is best remembered for Watergate, going to China and meeting Mao, and price controls. Eisenhower for big government programs. Hoover, for being the hapless fellow who had recently become President when the Great Depression began.</p>
<p>At first I thought that says something about today&#8217;s Republican party. And perhaps it does. Perhaps it indicates the party&#8217;s values today are very different than they ever have been.</p>
<p>But it also may serve as a warning to Obama. I&#8217;ve pointed out before that except for one or two issues (Obamacare and Supreme Court justices he&#8217;s nominated), Obama&#8217;s first term has looked an awful lot like the third term of GW Bush would have looked. Tax rates remain low, the percentage of personal income going to taxes is down and the bail-out is basically an extension of Paulson&#8217;s bazooka. In four years, four long years, Obama hasn&#8217;t managed to figure out a single new approach to dealing with the economic mess that wasn&#8217;t pioneered by the guy who got us into the hole in the first place! The same is true of most other aspects of the Obama presidency. Policies on civil liberties are essentially the same as they were under GW. The &#8220;good war&#8221; in Afghanistan is still going on, and the war that was getting increasingly inconvenient (even the folks at the National Review had managed to figure out there was a problem by 2007 leading to the death of the &#8220;painted schoolhouse&#8221; anecdotes) was ended discretely, with everyone pretending that Iran wasn&#8217;t firmly in the driver&#8217;s seat. Foreigners, at least the non-Pakistani ones, seem to like Obama, but that&#8217;s more because there&#8217;s less bluster about &#8220;with us or against us&#8221; &#8211; actual policy remains very similar, complete with a down-to-the-bone inability to distinguish friend from foe.</p>
<p>Obama seems to have been re-elected not with enthusiasm among Democrats, but rather due to a sense that Romney was even worse. Part of that came from a feeling that Romney&#8217;s views on business weren&#8217;t really about business, they were just about profiting from loading companies up with debt, as if that approach to running the government hasn&#8217;t been championed by every President we&#8217;ve had since 1980 other than Bill Clinton. And truth to tell, a lot of the foreboding about Romney came not so much from Romney, who at some point stood for everything and anything, and thus stood for nothing at all, but rather from the particularly in-artful downticket comments (think Akin or Mourdock) on &#8220;legitimate rape&#8221; (???, !!!!!) and abortions. Most Democrats and many independents aren&#8217;t happy with Romneycare, er, Obamacare. They see it as a distant second or third best compared to the socialized medical systems of every industrialized country that produces better healthcare outcomes than we do, and at lower cost to boot. The one bit of actual enthusiasm for Obama might have come on the gay rights side, as a growing number of younger voters in much of the country don&#8217;t have the bias against openly gay people that remains strong among social conservatives, particularly the older generations. But even there, the camel&#8217;s nose entered the tent during the previous administration &#8211; most Republicans were smart enough not to piss off Dick Cheney by criticizing his daughter. </p>
<p>All of which is to say, Obama is potentially headed down the Republican presidency path in more ways than one. Despite his re-election, unless Democrats are infinitely more forgiving than Republicans, Obama might eventually become his party&#8217;s George Bush- the name nobody wants to mention, the face nobody wants to see at campaign stops, and the legacy nobody wants to remember. The longer he follows the same policies as his predecessor, the greater the likelihood he will be viewed the same way by his own party&#8217;s posterity. </p>
<p>A lot of Democrats seem to believe that now we&#8217;re going to see the &#8220;real Obama.&#8221; I hear Democrats say that Obama isn&#8217;t constrained by the need for re-election any more, and he has realized that rolling over and playing dead doesn&#8217;t make Republicans or Wall Street like him any better. Perhaps that&#8217;s true, perhaps the next four years will be different, but I wouldn&#8217;t bet on it. Its been my experience that in general, people don&#8217;t change that much. If he&#8217;s been behaving a certain way for four years, it is very likely we&#8217;ve seen the &#8220;real Obama.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>I’d like to interject a very concrete example into the large swirl of quite theoretical, thought-experiment discussion about whether “demand for money” means “demand for the medium of exchange” or “demand for the medium of account.” <a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=17368">Scott Sumner</a> and <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/10/medium-of-account-vs-medium-of-exchange.html">Nick Rowe</a> are, as so often, at the center of this discussion. But before I do, I need to work through some conceptual and terminology issues.<br />Nick — who so often cuts so clearly to the crux of things — injects what he seems to feel (rightly so, I think) is a necessary update and clarification into his sally on the subject:<br />
<blockquote>…in my model, gold is the medium of account; and (say) an ounce of gold is the unit of account.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not clear whether or not the update was in reply to M.R.’s comment, which addresses exactly the point I want to make:<br />
<blockquote>I’m still not convinced that the concept of a “medium of account” is well enough specified. “Unit of account” is fairly straightforward; we measure everything in units (inches, kilograms, minutes, etc.) What is the “medium of account” in the current U.S. monetary system, analogous to the role that gold plays in your simple model? If your answer is “dollars” then I think you may have a very serious specification problem. This is very subtle and difficult.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nick does reply directly to that comment, and his reply’s uncertain nature fully supports my thinking:<br />
<blockquote>OK, but the unit of account (in my model) isn’t “ounces”, it is ounces of gold, as opposed to ounces of silver or ounces of hair.<br />Medium of account in the US? Hmm. Fed liabilities?</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we see Nick Rowe — who thinks as deeply and curiously (but I think misguidedly) about monetary economics as anyone out there — wondering what the U.S. medium of account <em>is</em>. This, after hundreds of years of very hard thinking by very smart people about the nature of money. It’s enough to make you question economists’ understanding of economics. They don’t even understand <em>money</em>?<br />The more I think about it, the more I think that “medium of account” is an incoherent concept (and even worse, “demand for the medium of account,” which seems doubly incoherent) — a will o’ the wisp that lures otherwise coherent thinkers into dangerous and bottomless conceptual b(l)ogs.</p>

<p>Think about “medium” and “media” in a very common usage — relative to information and entertainment. In this context media are vehicles for transmission — books, newspapers, TV, web pages.<br />This meaning kind of works for “medium of exchange” — dollar bills and bank interchanges are vehicles for transmitting something — value. Just like power lines and cans of gasoline are media for transmitting energy.<br />There are many media of monetary exchange (especially if you include purely financial transactions) — physical pieces of currency, credits in bank (and money-market) accounts, credit-card lines of credit, treasury bonds, bank reserves, etc. Dollar bills and bank-account credits have traditionally been the dominant media of exchange for exchanges involving real-world goods and services, but even that is far less true these days, given the quantity of credit-card sales. “Medium of exchange” at least makes conceptual sense. But “<em>the</em> medium of exchange” doesn’t. There are many. To steal M.R.’s words, it has “a very serious specification problem.”<br />“Money as the medium of account” is really far worse. What is being transmitted, and what is the vehicle? What does this term — in particular the word “medium” here – <em>mean</em>? It’s obviously about counting and measurement. But what is being measured, counted? I would say: value — just like a thermometer measures temperature, or a ruler measures length. But in those contexts, the media of account are <em>temperature</em> and <em>length. </em>(The units of account are degrees and inches, or whatever.) I’d like to suggest that in economic thinking the medium of account is <em>always</em> value — not “money” (however you choose to define that word), and never dollars or ounces of gold, which are <em>units</em> of account. If this is safe, “demand for the medium of account” would mean “demand for value” — which strikes me as obvious, or tautological, or just not very useful, conceptually. And “demand for the <em>unit</em> of account” obviously makes no sense at all; is there demand for inches or degrees?<br />This is where M.R. gets it right, and Nick in his update glances toward more useful thinking: we should be talking, thinking, about <em>units</em> of account, and how value is ascribed to those units.<br />In the normal course of things, a (physical or electronic) dollar has the same designated, ascribed, agreed-upon value as “the dollar.” But as Miles Kimball points out in what he describes as “<em><a href="http://blog.supplysideliberal.com/post/35123798395/how-subordinating-paper-money-to-electronic-money-can">the most important thing I have ever said about monetary policy</a>,” </em>this need not necessarily be true. A physical dollar can, conceptually at least, have a different value than an electronic dollar. (Once again I would say that each of these is a financial asset, an embodiment of money or exchange value, with particular properties and characteristics which may be in greater or lesser demand — and supply — at different times.) Different kinds of dollars could have different values, <em>as designated in dollars!</em> We really need different words for these things. (See: concrete example, below.)<br />Let me put it another way: I think Nick, Scott, and most economists don’t fully understand that “a dollar” is, conceptually, a completely different <em>type</em> of thing from “the dollar.” (At least they talk as if they don’t.) One is a unit (and vehicle) of exchange, the other is a unit of account, or measurement. And as Miles points out, even “a dollar” is not sufficiently specified.<br />I promised a concrete example, and here it is, courtesy of <em>This American Life</em>‘s typically brilliant “<a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/423/the-invention-of-money">The Invention of Money</a>” episode: how Brazil ended years of rampant hyperinflation. I’m rather astounded that, searching through my blog reader, I find that nobody has looked at this real-world example, even though it’s <em>exactly the situation</em> that Scott and Nick are talking about. (I’m sure there are others like it. Readers?)<br />Here’s the short story, but I recommend the whole thing; it’s short and very entertaining.<br />The cruzeiro had been plummeting in value (relative to real goods) for years. This was true both of the units of exchange (“cruzeiros” of all types — physical, electronic, etc.) and the unit of account (“the cruzeiro”) — necessarily so, because <em>they were uniformly conceived as the same thing</em>.<br />The solution was to introduce a new unit of account — rather cravenly titled the <em>real</em> in an effort to get people to ascribe real market-basket value to it — and to require its use in designating the <em>value</em> of everything, regardless of what units were exchanged. (Conceptually, they could have just revalued “the cruzeiro,” but nobody would have fallen for it because nobody trusted either the cruzeiro <em>or</em> cruzeiros. They would have continued to ascribe low — and ever-lower — value to it.)<br />By legislative fiat, all wages, taxes, and prices were to be designated in the new “real” unit of account.<br />
<blockquote>People had to be tricked into thinking money had value, when all signs told them that was absolutely not true. So Basha says, they wrote a plan for a new currency, one that was stable, dependable, trustworthy. The only catch was this currency would not be real. It would not be printed. There would never be coins. It was fake. They called it a virtual currency.<br /><strong>Edmar Basha</strong><br />We called the unit of real value, URV. Yeah, it was a virtue that didn’t exist in fact.<br /><strong>Chana Joffe</strong><br />People would still have cruzeiros, the local currency in their pockets. But when they got paid, their wages would be listed in URVs. Taxes were in URVs and all prices were listed in URVs. And URVs were stable. And so, for example, when you went to the store and bought some milk.<br /><strong>Edmar Basha</strong><br />How much does it cost? Say well, know we have it cost X. Let’s say one URV. Well, how much is that because I cannot pay with URV. Well, I have this little table here and today’s value of URV in cruzeiros is seven cruzeiros per URV. So it cost one URV, seven cruzeiros.<br />You go next week, well, it’s still one URV. But then you say, how many cruzeiros? You look, well, 14.<br /><strong>Chana Joffe</strong><br />Every night the central bank would put out a memo with the official conversion rate. And a table would get printed in the newspaper. The store clerk could look at the table in the newspaper and see, Monday, one URV is equal to seven cruzeiros. Tuesday, 12 cruzeiros. Wednesday, 14. Milk or whatever it was you were buying would stay the same price. There was no need for the sticker man.</p></blockquote>
<p>Eventually they phased out cruzeiros and issued physical reals. It worked:<br />
<blockquote>Brazil went from being an irrelevant, economic basket-case to one of the most important economies out there. The eighth largest in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice “unit” in the name. (Not “medium.”) The stability of the unit of account was what mattered — what value people ascribed to it. That ascription was anchored to real value because wages and taxes were designated in that unit, which also made “reals” into units of electronic exchange. (For the former: labor theory of value, anyone? For the latter: got chartalism?)<br />You’ll notice I never used the word “medium” to describe what happened here. At best it was unecessary, and at worst it would have sown all sorts of confusion and incoherence. We don’t need no stinking mediums.<br />Update: ﻿I should add that &#8220;unit&#8221; here is also used in two senses: 1. Exchange units of which there are many, that can be shuffled around physically or electronically, and 2. a more abstract and necessarily singular measurement or accounting unit. The value of the former are designated in the latter.<br /><em>Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=6296">Asymptosis</a>.</em></p>

                                <p>Andrew C. Thomas <a href="http://www.acthomas.ca/comment/2012/11/538s-uncertainty-estimates-are-as-good-as-they-get.html"> asks about Silver&#8217;s uncertainty estimates.</a>  (via <a href="https://twitter.com/nikete">@nikete</a>) My very confident guess was that Silver&#8217;s forecasts were too cautious &#8212; that his probability estimates were too close to 50 %, that he underestimated the precision of his point forecasts.</p>
<p> It is actually easy to check my hypothesis (not that I did) by looking at the p-values of outcomes.  For each state Silver had an estimate of the expected Obama minus Romney percent of vote (I will call this state_x below so Ohio_x was positive) and an estimate of the standard error of that estimate.  Given his approach of averaging lots of numbers, he was fairly confident that the forecast errors would be normally distributed.  This means that he could calculate the probability of Romney winning Ohio that is the proability that Ohio_x F_Ohio_NS (Ohio_x) is uniform from 0 to 1 that is U(0,1).  Thomas calculates 51 statistics of the form F_state_NS(state_x)  (where Washington DC gets temporary statehood for notational convenience).   I have gone through all this tiresome notation to define the Nate Silver calculated p-values of state outcomes.  If he is right not just about the mean but also about the spread around that mean, these 51 statistics should be distributed U(0,1)<!--0-->0></p>
<p>  Are they uniformly distributed ?  Damned if the distribution doesn&#8217;t look as much like a uniform distribution as any uniform distribution I&#8217;ve ever seen</p>
<p> &#8220;the 538 distribution is nearly uniform. The closer the points are to the diagonal, the better the fit to the uniform:&#8221;</p>

<p> This is much much much more impressive than just calculating that the probability of an Obama win was over 50% for each state Obama won and under 50% for each state he lost. </p>
<p> Wow. </p>
<p> Now this isn&#8217;t the whole story.  The overall probability of Obama victory does not just depend on the 51 univariate distributions.  The key question is how highly correlated across states are deviations outcome minus expected outcome.  Here there are three components <br />1) sampling error (which should be independent across polls and therefore over time and across states) <br />2) true change in population voting intentions from the time of the poll to the time.  This is complicated but all changes should be positively correlated across states. Silver had a monster estimate/guess of the correlation based on demographics some how.  I insist on reviewing subcases</p>
<p> a) true change in opinions about who should be president (very hard to understand but not a big deal on Nov 5)<br />b) undecided voters deciding (again tricky but there weren&#8217;t that many of them and there is a clear pattern of deciding pretty close to 50-50 in Presidentials and definitely more for the challenger in Congressional races)<br />c) moderately likely voters deciding whether to vote or not plus the effects of get out the vote efforts.  This is horribly complicated but can be considered a part of the real problem 3</p>
<p> 3) pollster bias.  Notably before the election Silver said that Romney&#8217;s simulated wins were almost all in simulations for which the computer guessed a large pro Obama average bias<br />a) from sampling (as in robo-pollers don&#8217;t sample cell phone only household) and weighting.<br />b) from a likely voter filter which doesn&#8217;t correctly find likely voters and the implicit rounding of probabilities of voting to 0 or 1.</p>
<p> Silver can&#8217;t know very much about this. In particular he has almost no information on the average pollster bias.<br /> He only gets information on the bias of a particular pollster when there is an actual election. Mid terms aren&#8217;t at all like Presidentials so really one observation every 4 years.  There are new pollsters which had no performance record at all.  It is easy to measure the difference in bias of two pollsters (that is the difference in the house effects).  It is very hard to calculate the average bias or the joint probability density that two pollsters are say biased 1% for Romney or something.  I think this must be a guess and that Thomas&#8217;s beautiful graph doesn&#8217;t show that Silver guessed right.</p>
<p> But it is a beautiful graph.  He did the same thing for Votamatic.  There he saw that too many p values were near &#8216;0 and near 1, that is too many outcomes were judged extreme by Drew Linzer. &#8220;the Votamatic predictions turned out to be too overly precise.&#8221;  That is Linzer had excessive confidence in his point estimates and underestimated the remaining uncertainty.  Here I stress that the graph for Votamatic is pretty damn good looking.  Performance not as good as Silver&#8217;s is perfectly consistent with amazingly good performance.</p>

                                <p>We are now mostly through Week 10 of the NFL season, which means most teams have played nine games. Unless Kansas City manages to beat Pittsburgh by more than 36 points on Monday*—not, to be gracious about it, the Way to Bet—there will be four teams in the NFL that have give up between 10 and 20 points more than the have scored.</p>
<p>You would naturally assume that those teams would have losing records, either 4-5 or even, the closer you get to –20, 3-6. But certainly it depends on the distribution of your wins and losses. But, just for fun, let’s look at the four teams:</p>

<p>This, not to put too fine a point on it, is why we apply statistical analysis. A couple of blowouts (both New Jersey teams lost today by three touchdowns, though the Jets—Jersey/B, as Gregg Easterbrook’s sole viable contribution to popular culture named them—gave up extra points as well) may skew the record—if every other game is close.  If I tell 100 people who know the rules of football but not the way the season has gone, “The Colts have given up 15 more points than they have scored through nine games,”  chances are that 80-90 of them would guess the team was 4-5 or even 3-6.  Some small number might guess 5-4, and an even smaller one will guess 6-3.</p>
<p>But then add information. For instance I say, “They <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=320909003">lost their first game of the season by 20 points</a>.”  At this point, those will at least moderate math skills realize that the Colts are +5 over 8 games; 5-3 is not out of the question, though 4-4 remains the Way to Bet—by a much smaller margin.</p>
<p>Now I add, “Coming into this week, they had only won one game by more than three points.”  Suddenly, that +5 looks strong; there is a shift of some set of the 4-5 people (who know the first week was a loss) to 5-4 (5-3 plus that loss).</p>
<p>The more information you get—“they were <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=321014020">blown out by Jersey/B</a> as well”—the more likely you are to guess that they might be 6-3.  But the odds still don’t favor that.  Indeed, the Dolphins have been blown out twice (-20, –34), but they have also won two blowouts (+22, +21). (The Bengals are 1-1 in blowouts; the Cowboys, like the Colts, are 1-2.)</p>
<p>So if we’re just looking at the raw data and the predictions of the people, we would see the Informed Voters hanging around 5-4 or even 6-3, the Paying Attention group splitting between 4-5 and 5-4, and some Randomly-Asked-Questions people guessing 3-6 or 4-5 (with a few clever enough to say 5-4 just because they know someone thought the question was interesting).</p>
<p>Any parallels to those complaining that Nate Silver was estimating percentages to four significant digits are left as an exercise to the reader.</p>
<p>*Or there is a blowout of epic proportion tonight between two teams that are both at least +100 through eight games.</p>

<p>Bloomberg, the Financial Times, the New York Times and other editorials wanted &#8216;to join the band climbing back on the wagon&#8217; so to speak along with some politicians.</p>
<p>by Linda Beale</p>
<p> What natural disasters like Sandy teach us about taxes and government, and why NY City Mayor Bloomberg endorsed Obama</p>
<p> Bloomberg announced <strike>today (</strike>a week ago<strike>)</strike> that President Obama would be the best candidate to lead the nation over the next four years.  See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/nyregion/bloomberg-endorses-obama-saying-hurricane-sandy-affected-decision.html?emc=na">Bloomberg Endorses Obama, Citing Climate Change</a>, New York Times (Nov. 1, 2012).  Bloomberg made the decision in part because of Hurricane Sandy, which wreaked havoc on the east coast, costing many lives and much financial distress.  Obama&#8217;s leadership and willingness to commit federal agencies to aid municipalities and people recover from the devastation was a marked contrast to the Bush Administration&#8217;s handling of Katrina and the utter disregard shown by Bush&#8217;s FEMA executives for prudent planning and quick response. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There is a clear consensus among reputable scientists that global warming is underway and that superstorms like Sandy are one of the likely results.  In that context, a vibrant and efficient emergency response organization is terribly important.  Obama has shown that he recognizes this, in the way that he has handled the preparations for, and implementation of plans after, Hurricane Sandy. </p>
<p>Romney has amply demonstrated that he does not recognize the importance of government action to deal with natural disasters and similar emergencies.  Instead, he has suggested that &#8220;private organizations&#8221; should replace FEMA and that many other similar federal agencies should be squeezed down or even squeezed out.  Even in the lead-up to Sandy&#8217;s east coast strike, Romney was assisting with a gathering of canned goods and praising private charitable responses to emergencies, even though such action is not a very effective way to mobilize emergency aid. Further, as Bloomberg noted in his endorsement of Romney, Romney&#8217;s positions on many issues have shifted radically to the right in his attempt to win the election:  “ &#8216;In the past [Romney] has taken sensible positions on immigration, illegal guns, abortion rights and health care – but he has reversed course on all of them, and is even running against the very health care model he signed into law in Massachusetts,&#8217; Bloomberg said.&#8221;  Id.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows anything about public infrastructure and natural disaster knows that charitable groups and money-making enterprises cannot possibly substitute for good government action.  That is the reason that so many in Haiti are still living in improvized dwellings and so many in Somalia still suffer from chaotic lives with anarchy rather than government as their norm. </p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s course is the right one.  He hasn&#8217;t been willing to speak as strongly about issues like the environment and global warming as I would like, because he is at heart a centrist.  But at least he knows that government can and must act in ways that private organizations cannot act, a truth that Romney seems incapable of acknowledging.  That is the reason that taxation needs to be increased rather than merely &#8220;starving the beast&#8221; to reduce the size of government.  Government is just &#8220;we the people&#8221; acting to do things that are needed that we cannot do individually or even through a business enterprise.  Government acting in those ways requires taxes to provide the revenues to support the activities.  And those things are not inherent evils, as the radical right today paints them.  Quite the contrary.  Taxation and government activity in support of the public good are vitally important parts of a sustainable democracy<br />.<br />cross posted and lightly edited <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/11/what-natural-disasters-like-sandy-teach-us-about-taxes-and-government-and-why-ny-city-mayor-bloomber.html">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/11/yesterday-i-urged-the-democrats-to-develop-some-backbone-in-response-to-the-continuing-right-wing-extortion-demands-for-milit.html">If the Dems got a backbone</a></p>
<p>Yesterday I urged the Democrats to develop some backbone in response to the continuing right-wing extortion demands for military spending increases, tax cuts and entitlement program changes.<br />How should that backbone be used?  Not an easy question to answer and likely my answer will upset many economists and tax professionals.  So I propose that we consider going over the fiscal cliff.  What do readers think, and why?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the argument I think can be made.  Given that the &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; deal doesn&#8217;t require cuts to social welfare programs, it might be advisable to let the fiscal cliff occur.  Let the spending cuts go through and let the Bush tax cuts expire.  The result will be that we will have taken a much needed first stab at cutting back on the exorbitant military spending that provides rentier profits to the military-industrial complex.  And we will have moved the game back to &#8220;start&#8221; regarding the appropriate kinds of tax cuts to enact.  <br />But there are spending cuts that may not make sense (cuts to public employee pensions) and definitely some tax cuts (and programmatic stimulus) is needed to deal with the continuing slow economic growth.  What if the President and Democrats in Congress provided a clear and transparent plan for dealing with those issues by announcing&#8211;at the same time that they refuse to go along with the GOP extortion demands, that they will press for passage of a reinvigorated tax code and modified spending reduction plan.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In January, Congress can start with a clean slate and quickly enact [ah, I know, this is the weak point&#8211;can the highly partisan Congress change its ways?] a much more judicious (and limited) set of tax cuts targeted to those with incomes under $100,000 and to industrial policies that make sense for today rather than 100 years ago (such as continuing subsidies for alternative energy while finally ending the various subsidies for the extractive industries like gas and oil and coal).  That should be accompanied by additional reforms to the tax code to simplify it and eliminate unreasonable preferences that favor the rich.  Elimination of the preferential rate for capital gains should be the first priority (and carried interest should be treated as what it is&#8211;delayed payment of compensation).   Reform of the corporate and international tax provisions to eliminate the ability of multinationals dependent primarily on intellectual property to avoid taxation on their profits by transfers to offshore affiliates and similar problems in the tax code related to the globalization of business should be the second one.</p>
<p>Those tax policies would be enacted in tandem with appropriate spending policies:  it is what we want to spend our taxes on, after all, that should decide what our taxation policies are.  We know we need to raise money to repay debt, to build and maintain our long-neglected public infrastructure (highways, bridges, government buildings, high-speed passenger rail, etc.) and to fund needed research and education (NIH, NSF, Pell grants, etc.).   In particular, we need to address the infrastructure and other changes that are necessary to address climate change&#8211;both defending ourselves from its effects to the extent possible (surge protection for New York, for example) and regulating ourselves to reduce the amount of change.  We know we can and must reduce the demands of the military industrial complex through spending cuts. </p>
<p>What might Congress accomplish, if it would approach the budget of the United States from the perspective of considering what we should be doing to make this a better nation, a more prepared and educated people, and a more sustainable economy? </p>

<p>Health Care Thoughts: Reform Status According to Really Smart People</p>
<p>So after two days in rooms full of top notch front line experts, and two nights sleeping on a couch in a hospital waiting room, I offer a list of key take-aways.. This is reporting only, not advocacy. Some of my opinions may vary (not much). I avoid the nitty-grittiest of operational details. So&#8230;..</p>
<p>The amount and complexity of work to be done in the next 24 months is crushing and impossible &#8211; expect delays or sloppy rollouts.</p>
<p>Scale is everything, small providers will get crushed. Impacts on rural health care uncertain, so&#8230;</p>
<p>Consolidation and integration is the critical  path. Some bad outcomes likely.</p>
<p>The Obama administration is incapable of producing regulations and guidance papers on time (in Washington a little late is considered on time).</p>
<p>Providers are preparing cuts both permenant and &#8220;cliff&#8221; cuts.</p>
<p>The amount and complexity of IT work through the system is staggering.  Data is the new currency of health care.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Setting up the exchanges is a massive and messy task, even in the enthusiastic states. Letting the feds install &#8220;plug-and-play&#8221; may become a good option for many states.</p>
<p>Some large public companies are seriously considering dropping health insurance and paying the penalty  (stunned me). No decisions yet known.</p>
<p>Winners, sorta in sequence:</p>
<p>Health IT &#8211; vendor companies and geeks<br />Health lawyers &#8211; transaction and regulatory<br />Health executives &#8211; the &#8220;talent wars&#8221; are going full blast<br />Health CPAs, finance officers and consultants<br />Physician executives<br />Nursing executives<br />Bureaucrats and regulatory</p>
<p>Losers</p>
<p>Physicians &#8211; mostly (depends on many factors)<br />Nurses &#8211; hands on care givers<br />Therapist and ancillary providers<br />Hospital support staff</p>
<p>Getting a child ready for college? Push them towards&#8230;..</p>
<p>IT, health emphasis<br />Health care administration<br />Medical records administration / health informatics<br />Medical coding (good jobs with 2 year degree)<br />Accounting and finance, health emphasis<br />Actuarial science</p>
<p>Private health insurers may be really big winners (oops). Some private health insurers are building primary care networks and ACOs.</p>
<p>There are some intesresting and even exciting geriatric care innovations morphing out of the Obama administration, academia and providers.</p>
<p>The &#8220;old elderly&#8221; are using huge amounts of Medicare resources, innovations may cut usage with the same or better care.</p>
<p>Hospital capital spending is going wild as a market share play, just what we don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>So, now to plug through a thousand or so pages on operational and regulatory details. Did I mention the Obama administration writes a lot of long and largely incomprehensible regulations and guidance statements?</p>
<p>Interesting times ahead.</p>
