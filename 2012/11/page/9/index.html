<p>Obama, Romney &#038; Enthusiasm</p>
<p>We live in lesser times.  The election is coming up, and our choices for President are pretty dismal.  I mean really, Barack Obama or Mitt Romney?  This is what it comes down to?  And the third party candidates, when one scratches below the surface, are not any better. An honest person must admit ample reasons to oppose everyone on the ballot.</p>
<p>With that said, there is one phenomenon about this election I find very curious.  Until Barack Obama came around, the only Presidents since the end of WW2 to increase the national debt as a percentage of GDP have been Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and the two Bushes.  So why is it that so many people who oppose Obama, who look to Reagan as a shining light, are yelling about financial responsibility and deficits?  They weren&#8217;t supporting Democrats since 1976, that is for sure, and it wasn&#8217;t that long ago that Dick Cheney told us boldly that that deficits don&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t get the economic concerns that Republicans have about Obama.  With the exception of Obamacare, essentially the same thing as Romneycare and very much based on a Heritage Foundation plan, Obama&#8217;s economic plan has been to continue GW&#8217;s policies.  Tax rates have been kept constant, right where GW left them.  The bailout was kept the same.  What exactly did he change?</p>
<p>Which leads to the same question for Democrats too:  what exactly did Obama change?  From where I&#8217;m standing, on the economic front, all I can point to is that Obama has, if anything, done less to rein in financial abuses than his predecessor did.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>After the dot com implosion, there were prosecutions.  After the much bigger mess from<br />2007 to 2009, crickets.  Similarly, when the dot com implosions were played out, none of the perpetrators were given handouts.  After the 2007 meltdown, not only did Obama continue GW&#8217;s bailout giveaways, he expanded them and has encouraged the Fed to do the same.  If there&#8217;s one class of Americans who are doing particularly well, its the folks who were most complicit in creating the mess the rest of the country is in.</p>
<p>I can say about the same thing with respect to social policies, foreign affairs, etc.  All of which is to say, there are a lot of people out demonizing one of the candidates, a candidate who is following their party&#8217;s prescription as well as any of their own party&#8217;s standard bearers, simply because he belongs to the other party.  And there are a lot of people supporting that candidate, that candidate who in deeds stands against what they stand for, simply because he is, nominally a member of their party.  The reason we live in lesser times is because, collectively, we are lesser people.</p>
<p>The other day I held my nose, scratched off a mark next to the name of the marginally lesser of the two evils (I originally planned to have a blank vote for President, but the other evil worries me more than I expected), and mailed in my absentee ballot.  I won&#8217;t advise you on whom to vote, but I would, strongly suggest that you not kid yourself.  If, like me, you are holding your nose, don&#8217;t pretend you are doing it with a lot of enthusiasm.  The stakes surrounding this election are far smaller than the stakes surrounding how we, the people, behave when it comes to politics.</p>

                                <p>
<div>Yesterday in Springfield, Ohio, the crowd listening to Barack Obama booed when the President brought up Mitt Romney and the Republican Congress. That prompted Obama to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/11/02/remarks-president-springfield-oh" target="_blank">say</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“No, no, no — don’t boo, vote. Vote! Voting is the best revenge.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney promptly pretended to be very outraged by this. He <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/11/03/romney_vote_for_love_of_country_not_revenge.html" target="_blank">told his supporters</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Yesterday, the President said something you may have heard by now. That I think surprised a lot of people. Speaking to an audience, he said, ‘voting is the best revenge.’ He told his supporters — voting for revenge. Vote for revenge? Let me tell you what I’d like to tell you. Vote for love of country.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney <a href="http://washingtonexaminer.com/romney-closes-big-love-of-country-vs.-revenge/article/2512532#.UJarSobDilE" target="_blank">picked up that refrain a second time</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Did you see what President Obama said today? He asked his supporters to vote for revenge — for revenge&#8230;Instead, I ask the American people to vote for love of country.”
</p>
</div>
<div>           
</p>
</div>
<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/">Mitt Romney insults the Americanelectorate one last time</a></i>, Greg Sargent, Washington Post, today
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>For me, one of the most frustrating aspects of this campaign is the failure of Obama and of the news media, time and again, to pretend to accept at face value that when Romney misinterprets the meaning of a word, a phrase or a fact, it because Romney really thinks that that’s what the word, the phrase, the fact <i>means</i> or <i>indicates</i>. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>There are now only one-and-one-half days of campaigning left.  <i>Pleeease</i>, Mr. Obama: Ask people whether they really want a commander-in-chief and a budget-and-tax-policymaker who thinks that “voting is the best revenge” means “vote for <i>policies</i> of revenge.” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>English is not this guy’s second language.  And he attended a fancy college-prep school, Stanford University, Brigham Young University, Harvard Law School and Harvard’s graduate school of business.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here’s betting that he learned his English-language interpretation skills in law school and business school. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>If you get my drift.  And I bet you do.

<p>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/11/bruce-bartlett-dangers-of-republican-know-nothingism/">Bruce Bartlett and the dangers of Republican know-nothingism</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/the-real-barrier-to-tax-reform/">Bruce Bartlett</a> goes off on some of the denialist behavior from the GOP. Bartlett writes: When a study doesn’t support their dogma, the GOP censors it: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/business/questions-raised-on-withdrawal-of-congressional-research-services-report-on-tax-rates.html">Nonpartisan Tax Report Withdrawn After G.O.P. Protest</a></p>
<p>Original study still available here: <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42729.pdf">Taxes and the Economy: An Economic Analysis of the Top Tax Rates Since 1945</a> (PDF)</p>
<p>Bartlett discussed how Republicans destroyed much of Congress’s analytical ability when they took over in 1995: <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/gingrich-and-the-destruction-of-congressional-expertise/">Gingrich and the Destruction of Congressional Expertise</a><br />He adds “This is part and parcel with poll denialism, global warming denialism, and the general right wing disdain for facts and reality.”</p>
<p>Note: Before making any kneejerk partisan reaction to this, note that Bartlett — Like Stockman and others — sre not trying to mske a pro-Democrat argument; rather, they are acknowledging a major societal concern when one of the 2 major political parties have foresaken science and reality and facts when they disagree with their agenda.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Dan here&#8230;I am willing to bet this is a non-partisan issue to some extent and age old way of supporting agendas&#8230;but if data cannot be trusted to have a bit of independence, where does that leave us?)</p>

<p>Health Care Thoughts: Business Model Angst</p>
<p>For the past two months I have been absorbed more so than usual in health care strategic and regulatory compliance issues. One of the top trends is the scramble for a workable business model for providers. The announcement this week of the Beaumont system merger with the Henry Ford system in Detroit is a good example.</p>
<p>Integration and consolidation are clearly the early winners, although the Obama administration still has not gotten the DOJ and FTC on the same page with Health and Human Services.<br />Integration is supposed to pave the way for innovative payment systems, better data accumulation and better clinical quality. The jury is still out.</p>
<p>In a somewhat related note, I have heard a similar comment from all over the country &#8211; rolling out electronic medical records tied into networks (EHR) is a slow, expensive, agonizing process.</p>

<p>Her philosophy is that &#8220;the tax system should reflect the values of ordinary Americans and our long-held belief in principles of liberty, equality and community. I fear that we have instead tended to give too much credence to purportedly &#8220;objective&#8221; ideas about taxation based on the rationales of law and economics and unverified theories about economic growth, and too little credence to human needs for community that require allocating the burdens and benefits of the tax system fairly among the people and entities that make up our system.&#8221; She maintains her own blog <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/" target="_blank">ataxingmatter</a> as well.</p>

My original field of study was international economics and international finance. I just celebrated the 25th anniversary of publishing <a href="http://econseer.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">SEER</a> &#8212; my equity strategy product.

I have a PhD in economics (Harvard 1989) and teach economics at the University of Rome &#8220;Tor Vergata&#8221;. I wasn&#8217;t always like this. I have a bachelor&#8217;s degree in biology. Oddly, I don&#8217;t blog much at my own site <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/">rjwaldmann</a> about economics or Italy. Currently, I am obsessed with Obama, but I&#8217;ll try not to bore people with stuff they already read 10 times today. As an economist (roughly) I am interested in behavioral economics, growth, and the economics of inequality. Actually much of my current research, such as it is, is really in econometric methodology and statistics. I was very unorthodox in the 80s, but the orthodoxy is much less rigid now.</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Webb: </strong>I am by training a historian and mythologist who then has spent my working career in information retrieval and land use regulation. My interest in Social Security arose when I noticed in passing that the dates related to &#8216;crisis&#8217; were moving but that nobody seemed to be noticing that and still less asking the key questions &#8216;why?&#8217; and &#8216;can this go on?&#8217; So I set out to try to answer those questions and then share the results which somehow led to a gig here at AB. Politically I am somewhat left of left of center and could best be described as a &#8216;New Dealer&#8217; and so weigh in on more overtly political questions as the opportunity arises.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Wilder: </strong> She writes her own column, <strong>The Wilder View</strong>, at Nouriel Roubini&#8217;s <em>Economonitor</em> as well.  After receiving my Doctorate in Economics, I was an assistant professor for two years. However, I realized that teaching just wasn&#8217;t for me and took a job in private sector. Now, I am an Economist in the financial industry. As an economist in finance, I analyze data, write commentary, and offer economic insight to traders, chiefs of staff, and really anyone who wants my opinion. It is in this job that I developed a fancy for writing, but mostly I love talking about economics to anyone who will listen.</p>
<p><strong>History of Angry Bear:</strong> Written by Cactus</p>
<p>The eponymous Angry Bear blog is the brainchild of&#8230; Angry Bear (&#8220;AB&#8221;), who founded the blog in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/02/income-and-consumption-so-heres.html">February of 2003</a>. The title of the blog reflects his emotional reaction (anger) to his view of the state (bearish) of the state of the economy when the blog was founded. Sadly, he had cause to maintain that sentiment for quite a while.  Kash Mansori joined the blog in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2003/08/recognizing-obvious-i-liked-this.html">August 2003</a>, and PGL arrived <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/06/national-review-v.html">a year later</a>.</p>
<p>AB, Kash, and PGL formed the core of the blog for many years. Each has a Ph.D. in economics, but AB&#8217;s focus is on microeconomic issues, Kash&#8217;s are in macroeconomic issues, and PGL&#8217;s training is in finance. Neither AB nor Kash has posted here in a while, but we hold out hope for their eventual return. We also hold out hope for the return of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/another-budget-another-disaster.html">CR</a>, who posted for several years at both Angry Bear and his own blog, <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">Calculated Risk</a>. However, we can at least continue to enjoy his insights on real estate, housing, and banking trends, and economic indicators at the Calculated Risk blog.</p>
<p>Since 2006, Angry Bear has added more regulars &#8211; some have remained, some have stayed for a while and then moved on.  Former regulars include  <strong>Stormy,</strong> <strong>Tom Bozzo</strong>, and Noni Mausa.</p>

<p>Tax Policy: You Can’t Handle the Truth</p>
<p><a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/11/crs-withdraws-study-taxes-growth-mcconnell-hatch.php">Sahil Kapur</a> reports on something that does not surprise me on two levels: <br />
<blockquote>The author of a Congressional Research Service study, who found no evidence that tax cuts for high income earners lead to economic growth, is standing by his work, after the legislative branch’s nonpartisan research arm withdrew the report under pressure from Republican leaders. And Democratic principals are demanding to know why CRS caved to GOP pressure. CRS quietly and quickly pulled the six-week old report, despite the wishes of the research arm’s economic team, the New York Times reported Thursday &#8230; The study, which TPM and others reported on at the time, delved into the last 65 years of U.S. tax policy — specifically how marginal rates on high incomes and capital gains taxes impact decision-making. It concluded that reducing effective taxes on the rich does not generate economic growth, but that it does correlate with rising income inequality in the short term. The report’s conclusions aren’t terribly controversial in mainstream economics.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Thomas Hungerford wrote has indeed been the consensus view among economists who are not prostituting themselves for Mitt Romney&#8230; (More at <i>Econospeak</i>)</p>

<p>This was another mixed employment report.  The headline increase of 171,000 increase in payroll employment and 410,000 rise in employment reported in the household survey appeared strong.  But  other signs of weakness appeared within the report.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wwjqya2WuEQ/UJPE4YJ4CgI/AAAAAAAACTo/UXi2OqvD67s/s1600/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wwjqya2WuEQ/UJPE4YJ4CgI/AAAAAAAACTo/UXi2OqvD67s/s320/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>The 184,000 increase in private payroll employment was the strongest since February.</p>

<div></div>
<div>The unemployment rate ticked up from 7.8 to 7.9.  But this may actually be a bullish development because it stemmed from a 578,000 jump in the labor force.  A large increase in the labor force may mean that people are more optimistic about employment prospects and are rejoining the labor force.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Moreover, the number of people working part time for economic reasons fell -304,000.</div>

<p>But the  work week fell from  33.7 to 33.6 and the index of aggregate hours works fell -0.1 from 103.8 to 103.7.  Relative to the trend establish early in this cycle, hours worked has been weak for several months..</p>

<p>Moreover average hourly earnings was essentially unchanged as it fell from $19.80 to $19.79..<br />The growth in average hourly earnings plunged to  1.2%, an all time record low.</p>

<p>Average weekly fell from $667.26 to $664.94 and the year over year growth rate was only 1.2%, the smallest gain in this cycle.</p>

<p>Romney shows he&#8217;s a &#8220;know-it-all&#8221; who has no real ideas at all.</p>
<p>I missed almost all of the first debate but watched most of this second one.  My quick sum-up of the action was the Obama was straightforward, prepared, and much more energetic than in the first debate.  While I don&#8217;t think he has been a great president, he has nonetheless acted on a number of matters in ways that move us away from the disastrous policies of the Bush years&#8211;fairer immigration actions, more interest in the middle class and jobs, wise action to save the auto industry when Romney would have allowed one of the midwest&#8217;s major industries to rot on the vine, attempting to move the corporate tax debate away from giveaways for the multinationals and towards more reasonable tax policies, movement on health care reform (though still not towards the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-payer_health_care">single-payer</a> option that we must eventually embrace), movement on financial institution reform through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodd%E2%80%93Frank_Wall_Street_Reform_and_Consumer_Protection_Act">Dodd-Frank</a> (though still not sufficient control of the financialization of the economy).</p>
<p>Romney, quite frankly, came across as an arrogant shell who doesn&#8217;t have any substance underneath the expensive coif of hair and Armani suit.  He constantly blames Obama for the Great Recession that stemmed directly from the failed Bush economic policies favored by the Republican party&#8217;s right wing, the same policies that Romney and Ryan want to re-install if they take over the White House.  He consistently fails to acknowledge that the deficits under Obama were temporary ones caused by the trillions of dollars of unnecessary Bush individual and corporate tax cuts, the Bush preemptive wars, the class warfare of tax policies that favor the 1%, privatization of education and the militaryh, and the financialization of the economy egged on under Bush by the right&#8217;s misguided views of &#8220;free&#8221; trade (meaning business can run over the workers and the environment at will and pay less taxes even while causing more societal harm).  Romney (as Obama noted in the debate tonight) goes George W. Bush even further&#8211;he would ruin Medicare by turning it into &#8220;voucher-care&#8221; that was insufficient to meet vulnerable seniors&#8217; needs, and he would destroy Social Security by privatizing it so that seniors are at the whim of the stock market and Wall Street traders for their very livelihood.</p>

<p>Yet this guy born with a silver spoon in his mouth and with a family of connections to power really thinks that he got where he is on his own!  What a laugh.  And then he thinks that he can bamboozle the American people by saying &#8220;I know how to do that&#8221; about creating jobs, getting rid of the deficit, creating growth, solving immigration, making us &#8220;energy dependent in 8 or 5 years&#8221; and everything else he can promise us.  But he doesn&#8217;t think he has to bother to tell us anything about how he will do that.  Often when asked specific questions, he fell back on his &#8220;The last four years with Obama have been awful and I feel your pain&#8221; absurdity,  </p>
<p>His claim of empathy with the ordinary folks asking questions in the audience was absurd because one only has to harken back to that tape of his disdain for the 47%&#8211;and his arrogant view that anyone in that group was dependent on government and unwilling to take personal responsibility for themselves&#8211;to know that he doesn&#8217;t really give a damn about ordinary folk like those in the audience tonight.  He&#8217;d follow that with another claim that he would fix everything because &#8220;I know how to do that&#8221;, yet in every instance there was nary a specific word about  exactly what he would do.  </p>
<p>One thing is for sure&#8211;Romney&#8217;s view that cutting tax rates across the board by 20% will jump-start the economy is &#8220;nonsense&#8221;, as even conservative GOP economist Bruce Bartlett acknowledges.  See Bruce Bartlett, <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/romneys-tax-plan-and-economic-growth/">Romney&#8217;s Tax Plan and Economic Growth</a>, Economix Blog, New York Times (Oct. 16, 2012) (statng that &#8220;the idea that tax reform will jump-start an economy suffering from the after-effects of a cyclical downturn is nonsense&#8221; and concluding that &#8220;even if Mr. Romney’s plan is enacted as proposed the growth effect will be small to nonexistent&#8221;).</p>
<p>On taxes, Romney now claims that he will not cut the amount of taxes paid by the top 5% but will give everybody else a tax cut.  Note that isn&#8217;t the same that he has said for months on end, when he made clear that everybody would get the same 20% rate reduction (which would give the wealthy a huge dollar cut, and the middle class a piddling cut) and mocked Obama for wanting to hold the upper-crust more accountable for helping reduce the deficit.  He claims he&#8217;ll not increase the deficit, even though he wants to cut taxes and eliminate the estate tax and increase military spending.  He won&#8217;t say what deductions he&#8217;ll cut or what protections for the poor he&#8217;ll keep. </p>
<p>He claims the numbers add up but won&#8217;t tell us what the numbers are.   I think it&#8217;s perfectly clear:  he won&#8217;t say how he can do that in a revenue-neutral way because it can&#8217;t be done.  The New York Times editorial yesterday chimed into the growing list of reputable organizations asserting that his numbers simply don&#8217;t add up, noting &#8220;the many deceptions in the campaign’s blue-sky promises of low taxes and instant growth.&#8221;  See Editorial, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/16/opinion/mitt-romney-needs-a-working-calculator.html">Mitt Romney Needs a Working Calculator</a>, New York Times (Oct. 15, 2012). <br />
<blockquote>[The Joint Committee on Taxation] asked its staff what would happen if Congress repealed the biggest tax deductions and loopholes and used the new revenue to lower tax rates. The staff started adding it up: end all itemized deductions, tax capital gains and dividends as ordinary income, and tax the interest on state and local bonds, along with several other revenue-raisers.    <br /><a href="http://media.bloomberg.com/bb/avfile/r9DCbKWFmKdw">The answer came last week</a>: ending all those deductions would only produce enough revenue to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-12/repealing-deductions-pays-for-4-tax-cuts-study-says.html">lower tax rates by 4 percent</a>. <br />Mitt Romney says he can lower tax rates by 20 percent and pay for it by ending deductions. The joint committee’s math makes it clear that that is impossible. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note that Romney doesn&#8217;t intend to tax dividends and capital gains at the same ordinary income rate that us ordinary folks pay on our compensation income, so he wouldn&#8217;t even get to a 4% reduction in rates with his version of tax &#8220;simplification.&#8221;  He wants to keep allowing people like him to get a tax-advantaged &#8220;preferential rate&#8221; on carried interest that they get as their compensation in vulture capital &#8220;private equity&#8221; funds that buy up American businesses and load them with debt and offshore their jobs.  He wants to keep taxing capital gains and dividends at the ridiculously low rates achieved by the Bush tax cuts that were a major factor in driving us from surplus to deficit.  He even wants to cut capital gains and dividend and interest tax rates to zero for those making less than $200,000.  (<em>Of course, that group doesn&#8217;t have much of that kind of capital income&#8211;it is mostly the province of the very rich at the top.  One suspects the rate cut for the upper middle class that would apply to is just a prelude, like most of the Bush-era tax cuts, to a Republican push to eliminate taxes entirely on capital income, which Romney and Ryan have supported in the past.</em>)  He wants to cut taxes for the huge multinational corporations and encourage them to continue moving our jobs offshore.</p>
<p>There is no way that such a tax policy makes sense for America.  It will let the rich get richer, when we are already at a point where the middle class is shrinking because of the way big business has grabbed all the productivity gains for the managers and owners and left ordinary workers hanging out to dry.</p>
<p>Reaganomics&#8211;with its push for privatization, tax cuts, militarization, and deregulation&#8211;stabbed at the heart of the US economy.  The Bush tax cuts drove us from surplus to deficit in one fell swoop and set the stage for the Republican obstructionist games that have gone on during the four years of the Obama administration, in which the radical right GOP has cared more about pushing for extremist policies beneficial to the wealthy and the big corporations they run rather than considering what is good for the country.  Romneyomics would be even worse&#8211;right-wing market fundamentalism at its most extreme, with the rich making off like bandits and the rest of us left to scramble for crumbs. Surely the American folk aren&#8217;t going to buy this idea of rehashing the very ideas that got us into the Great Recession mess from the guy who says &#8220;I know how to run the country because I got rich as a vulture capitalist&#8221;.</p>
