<blockquote>&#8230; state income and sales taxes, which were quick to decline during the recession, have also improved relatively quickly in the recovery. According to the Census Bureau, state revenues were beginning to improve by the middle of 2010 and continued to rise last year. Rising revenues have meant that at least 25 states, including Kansas, are projected to finish their current fiscal year (ending in June) with a budget surplus, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>Now that states do have a choice about their spending priorities, the question in state legislatures around the country has been, “What to do with the surplus?”</p>

                                <p>alternate title QE 2.MMMCCCLLXXIX as I am a bit obsessed.  One of the many bees in my bonnet is the argument over whether the Fed&#8217;s QE 2 policy hinted, suggested, teased and announced August 10 2010 through November 3 2010 had much of an effect.  My impression remains that it had remarkably little effect on anything for a roughly trillion dollar open market shift.  <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.it/2012/06/non-blast-from-past.html">My view </a>is that the problem was the Fed traded money for the most money like asset which wasn&#8217;t trading as a perfect substitute for money (7 year Treasury notes &#8212; the shortest maturity paying an interest yield noticeably above 0).  This would be a way to minimize the effect for a given quantity. </p>
<p>This post is supposed to be about evidence.  The thing which struck me long ago is that the price of 7 year notes went down in the period from the first hingt of QE2 through the first actual purchases.  This suggests to me that 7 year notes were treated as close substitutes for cash with a relative price not exactly their face value (perfect substitutes don&#8217;t have to have equal prices).  The reply was that the differential between nominal treasuries and TIPS (bonds indexed to the CPI) went up showing an increase in expected inflation which is the key.  To be brief, this pattern corresponds to QE2 working as a signal of future monetary policy and not directly by changing the amount of 7 year notes private agents hold in their portfolios.  </p>
<p>The story, as I understand it, is that the key issue is whether the Fed will keep the federal funds rate near zero when unemployment gets down near the non accelerating inflation rate (NAIRU).  People with this view tend to argue that the Fed could have convinced people that it would keep rates miniscule causing increased inflation, but chose not to.  They tend to argue that QE2 was not very effective, because the Fed was careful to not signal any intention of allowing inflation over 2%.  This post does not address that argument, which would be about why QE2 was ineffective. Rather it addresses the straw man who claims QE2 was effective because it shifted expectations of policy in the misty future with non horrible unemployment rates.  </p>
<p>OK finally a figure showing breakevens: ordinary nominal treasury yields minus TIPS yields. I&#8217;m supposed to warn that it isn&#8217;t really investors&#8217; inflation forecast as bond prices depend on other things including liquidity.  I have a problem with FRED (not with all available data but with easily available data).  FRED doesn&#8217;t show yields on specific nominal Treasuries, because there are just too many of them, but does show yields on specific TIPS of which there are quite few.  This means that the maturity of the real and npominal interest rate series will not exactly match.  I do what I can about this sticking to FRED.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VdWVXMqSS_w/T9TJAxcBLiI/AAAAAAAAAKo/yGv1NMLhlLw/s1600/tips2.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VdWVXMqSS_w/T9TJAxcBLiI/AAAAAAAAAKo/yGv1NMLhlLw/s400/tips2.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Sorry for the pointless legend.  The green line shows the data stressed by say Brad DeLong.  It is a 5 year breakeven inflation rate showing the difference between the 5 year constant maturity normal (nominal) Treasury yield and the 5 year constant maturity TIPS yield.  The blue line shows the difference between the yield on TIPS maturing July 15 2013 and the 2 year constant maturity (nominal) yield.  The red line shows the yield on the TIPS maturing July 15 2012 minus the 1 year constant maturity nominal interest rate.  The black line shows the yield on the TIPS maturing July 15 2012 minus the 2 (two) year constant maturity nominal interest rate.  The breakeven compared to regular nominal Treasuries maturing July 15 2012 should be somewhere in between.</p>
<p>Well that was a lot of typing for one figure.  But the pattern is clear.  The increase in the breakeven inflation rate is higher for shorter maturities than for longer maturities.  This is the opposite of the pattern strawman would predict. Strawman argues that QE2 caused increased expected inflation in the fairly distant future and this  affects inflation and expected inflation in the nearer future through a forward looking Phillips curve.  The change in expected inflation should be greater at longer maturities.  My guess is that the increase in expected inflation is a coincidence.  This post is too long already so more (in progress) after the jump.</p>

<p>I know you guessed, but my belief is that the coincidence is that the price of petroleum increased around the time QE2 was gradually announced.  Importantly TIPS are indexed to the CPI not the CPI minus food and energy.  Here the black line is, as before, the 2 year constant maturity nominal interest rate minus the yield on the TIPS maturing July 15 2012.  The blue line is the monthly percent increase in the price of a barrel of West Texas intermediate crude oil divided by 10 to fit it on the same graph.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nvsovy44cgM/T9TWh16otvI/AAAAAAAAALU/MHQ0uaz9BIw/s1600/crudetex.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nvsovy44cgM/T9TWh16otvI/AAAAAAAAALU/MHQ0uaz9BIw/s400/crudetex.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notice that they track although the oil price changes (even when divided by 10) are noisy.  They are monthly averages, because that is the easy way to get percent change from a month ago.  This isn&#8217;t the way things should be, the oil price changes are backward looking and very short term.  There is no economic logic behind dividing by 10 (0.1 is larger than the share of petroleum as an input to production of goods and services in the CPI basket).  Of course there are very few numbers graphed.  This graph may convince no one but me, but it convinces me.</p>
<p>Finally, to discuss an approach which doesn&#8217;t convince me at all, some have tried event studies.  Here the assumption is that markets are efficient so the full effect of an event on asset prices the moment the event becomes known to the public.  In the case of QE2 this is tricky as news dribbled out.  For one thing I distinguish between QE2.1 the declaration that the Fed would use proceeds from maturing mortgage backed securities to buy treasuries and not to retire money.  This amounted to an estimated (guessed) change in the planned supply of high powered money by about $400 billion and was <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20100810a.htm">announced August 10</a>.  QE2 is generally used to refer to QE2.2 the purchase of an additional $600 billion in 7 year Treasury Notes with newly issued high powered money.  The first public hint of this program was chairman <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100827a.htm">Bernanke&#8217;s August 27 speech at Jackson Hole Wyoming</a>.  Note that it was just mentioned as a possibility.  Announcements that it was actually happening and that the amount would be $600 billion came later on September 21 2010 and November 3 2010.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2012/el2012-16.html">Michael Bauer at the San Francisco Fed looks at the sum of changes of interest rates on three dates August 10 plus September 21 plus November 3.</a>  Oddly he doesn&#8217;t look at the relatively famous date of August 27 2010.  The sum is &#8211; 14 basis points (-0.14 %) for the 10 year constant maturity treasury rate, -13 basis points for BBB corporate bonds and -14 basis points for 30 year MBS.  These are very small numbers.  The standard deviation of daily changes of the 10 year constant maturity treasury rate was over 6.6 basis points in 2010.  The standard deviation of the sum of three changes is root three times that.  A change of -14 basis points does not reject the null that nothing special happened those days at standard confidence intervals (the t-statistic with 3 degrees of freedom is about -1.2).  Also the 10 year constant maturity rate increased on August 27 2010.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe in event studies, but I note that there is almost no evidence of any effect of QE2 in the FRBSF Economic Letter.</p>

<p>Is Globalization Good for America&#8217;s Middle Class? Part 1</p>
<p>In this blog, I have frequently documented economic trends that have been bad for the middle class: <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/basics-real-wages-remain-below-their.html">Declining real wages</a>, steadily <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/07/us-health-care-bang-for-buck-declining.html">falling bang for the healthcare buck</a>, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/04/america-shows-no-increase-in-college.html">stagnant educational attainment</a>, the gigantic <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/tax-havens-cost-middle-class-untold.html">cost of tax havens</a>, etc. With this post, I want to begin exploring one possible reason for the economic insecurity of the middle class, namely globalization. Today, we will look at who wins and who loses from international trade, one of the key elements of globalization.<br />    <br />In <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2010/04/29/everyone-prospers-with-free-tr">some circles</a>, one is likely to see a variant of the claim that &#8220;everybody&#8221; is better off because of freer trade. Even according to the most mainstream economic theory, this is simply false. The workhorse theory for determining the distributional effects of trade (i.e., who wins and who loses) is called the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem, first enunciated in an article by Wolfgang Stolper and Paul Samuelson in 1941.</p>
<p>To understand this theory, you need to know that economists think about national economies in terms of the amount of land, labor, and capital they have <u>compared to all other countries in the world</u>. These &#8220;factors of production&#8221; can be in relatively high supply compared to the rest of the world, in which case they are referred to as &#8220;abundant,&#8221; or in relatively low supply compared to the rest of the world, in which case we call them &#8220;scarce.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The theorem can be stated in quite simple terms, but its consequences are not at all simple: As trade expands, owners of abundant factors of production benefit, and owners of scarce factors of production are harmed. Here, &#8220;benefit&#8221; means their real income increases, while &#8220;harmed&#8221; means their real income decreases.</p>
<p>Remember, trade can expand for two main reasons. First technological innovations can reduce the cost of transportation, making it first possible, then cheaper, to send goods long distances. For example, political scientist <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/4510.html">Ronald Rogowski</a>, in his great book <i>Commerce and Coalitions</i> shows how the introduction of the steamboat made it possible to export North American wheat to Western Europe, displacing wheat from Eastern Europe. Second, policy changes like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the trade agreements embodying the World Trade Organization (WTO) reduce or eliminate costly barriers to trade and lead to its expansion.<br />    <br />The grain example helps show why trade creates winners and losers. The Midwest U.S. and Canadian Prairie provinces are a gigantic breadbasket made possible by low population density, which implies abundant land and scarce labor. Expanding trade gave these farmers new markets and higher incomes. In much more densely populated Europe, the reverse is true: labor is abundant and land is scarce. As a result, expanding trade in grains meant more import competition and lower income for European farmers..    <br />Fast forward to today and we can ask what U.S. factor endowments are currently. As a rich country internationally, the United States is necessarily a capital abundant country. As a comparatively low population density country, it is land abundant but labor scarce. The answer is to our initial question is then quite clear: expanding trade is harmful to U.S. workers because imports of labor-intensive products and services from abroad create competition for American workers, reducing their real wages. As I have discussed before, U.S. real wages have remained below their peak for 39 straight years, just as the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem would predict.<br />     <br />What about <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/05/free-trade-benefits-everyone-canard.html">all the cheap goods we now buy at Wal-Mart</a>? It doesn&#8217;t change this story at all, because the lower price of imported goods is already reflected in the inflation rate we use to calculate real wages.    <br />Rogowski&#8217;s book also argues that we can expect certain pattens of political coalitions to form, with the winners from trade on one side and the losers on the other. NAFTA illustrated this well, with capital and agriculture generally in favor of the agreement (minus a few small specialty agricultural products like oranges), while labor was strongly opposed. And of course, this only helps us understand economic reasons for support or opposition to trade agreements; for non-economic reasons such as the environment, we have to look elsewhere. Although beyond the scope of this post, Rogowski&#8217;s analysis of the entire world through phases of rising and falling trade (i.e., the Great Depression) lends strong credence to his claims. You should definitely read his book sometime.<br />    <br />Economists are divided over how big this effect is. In the 1990s, when I first started teaching, the most common view of economists was that technological change was the driver increasing the premium for high skilled labor while reducing wages for low-skilled labor. Adrian Wood&#8217;s 1994 book, <i>North-South Trade, Employment, and Inequality</i>, argued that trade was in fact the main culprit, (a good, ungated analysis is Richard Freeman&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/pdf/Classic_Media/Freeman_1995_Globalization.pdf">Are Your Wages Set in Beijing</a>?&#8221;). Although this met with a lot of resistance at the time, Wood&#8217;s view has gained a lot of traction among economists based on developments over the last 15 or so years. Paul Krugman, a particularly noteworthy example due to his Nobel prize, has gone from being <a href="http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/ricardo.html">a fanatic adherent of free trade</a> to someone who sees trade as a big problem, though even today <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/protectionism-and-stimulus-wonkish/">he is not quite willing to pull the plug on free trade</a>.<br />    <br />One important point Rogowski makes (and Stolper and Samuelson did before him) is that the theory of comparative advantage tells us that the winners from trade gain more than the losers lose, which makes it possible in principle to compensate the losers and have everyone be better off. But he also argued that those who benefit economically from trade will see their political power increase, something that has certainly been borne out in the United States in the more than 20 years since his book was published. This makes it less likely that such compensation will occur, and we certainly haven&#8217;t seen any policy in the U.S. that comes close to making everyone better off as a result of trade.<br />    <br />One small bit of comfort comes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Conscience-Liberal-Paul-Krugman/dp/0393060691">Paul Krugman&#8217;s book</a> <i>The Conscience of a Liberal</i> (pp. 262-3). He provides us some reason to think that the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem isn&#8217;t necessarily destiny, as he shows that the United State and Canada, two countries with the same factor endowments as each other, have distinctive differences in political outcomes, particularly with regard to unionization rates.    <br />Overall, unfortunately, it looks like the answer to today&#8217;s question is clear: freer trade has harmed, and is harming, the American middle class. But globalization is more than trade, and I will continue to analyze other elements of globalization in my next few posts. </p>

                                <p>By Noni Mausa</p>
<p>Let’s Play “You Be The Sucker!”</p>
<p>Let’s see. Business and banks have heaps of money – and aren’t hiring, spending their money, or loaning it out. Meanwhile, a few million working-age Americans have no money and no work, and many are young, strong, highly trained and capable. Business is complaining that they can’t get suitable employees for some sectors. But they aren’t training them, and in sectors where wages are low, they aren’t raising wages. Houses stand empty, while thousands are homeless or living in cramped conditions with family or friends. They are all playing “Don’t Make Me The Sucker.” It’s like a game of musical chairs where no-one gets off their chairs except the terminally benign or naïve. You can crank up the music all you want, but nobody’s moving.</p>
<p>And in this game, they’re all correct. If any of them moves without all the others moving, they get to be The Sucker. For instance, what if the unemployed went first? Suppose they went to the zero lower bound of wages and offer to work for free till the economy improves, “to show willing,” as the Brits say. But the losses they would court – loss of unemployment support, loss of time for real job search – are hardly balanced by the slim possibility that the humble homage they pay to the source of all human worth, the employer, will in the future be rewarded by a decent wage and steady work. Giving something for free hardly ever raises its price. In a rising economy this could work, for some. In a stagnant one, the unpaid employee is the sucker.
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uDO2IvrAC1g/T9PlT8Dl7PI/AAAAAAAAA5A/IBCGNAkzd7k/s1600/fenwick.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-uDO2IvrAC1g/T9PlT8Dl7PI/AAAAAAAAA5A/IBCGNAkzd7k/s320/fenwick.png" width="245"></a></div>
<p>    <br />But the employer is in a fix too. There’s no fence that keeps his success from nourishing the business-slackers around him. If he goes first, and pays his people a living wage, his employees will spend their dollars at the cheapest stores – the ones who didn’t waste their time and money on wages and benefits. The generous employer creates customers for others, not for himself. If he goes first, he’s the sucker.    </p>
<p>Even if new employees were his for free, enlarging his business when there are no customers is a recipe for failure. He briefly nourishes other businesses by building a bigger plant, investing in machinery and training, and what comes of it? He gets to be the sucker. Banks trying to make loans in a time of stagnation are obvious suckers. Where’s the profit in loaning at 3.8% when the risks of default are not only high, but controlled by other, unpredictable, even fraudulent actors in the financial arena? If hegoes first, he’s the sucker.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>   <br />Businesses who need specialized employees are suckers if they try to train them or take them through apprenticeship. Where’s the guarantee that the employee won’t take his skills elsewhere – to a business that can offer higher wages because they didn’t waste money in training? If a business trains first, he’s the sucker. Each one alone is a sucker for trying to do what, in a functioning economy, makes sense. In stagnation, only fools try to go first, and not one in a hundred succeed if they try.<br />    <br />So obviously what we need, right here, right now, is a nation of fools. Can anything get all the players off their chairs in back into Mr. Fezziwig’s dance? Nobody trusts anybody, and rightly. The smaller players can’t do it, and the giant ones hardly need to. \But something needs to be done. As our wise Mr. Pratchett said regarding the game foote-the-ball, “…a tactic was for players to cluster thickly around their own goal so there was no possibility of anything getting past them. I regret however that if both teams do this you do not have a game so much as a tableau.”<br />    <br />And a tableau, however individually sensible, is not an economy.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I’m not nearly the first to this party, but want to bring it up for my readers who may not be clued in to it.
<p>For the second year in a row, some of the best economics bloggers on the Web (this year: Matt Yglesias, Mike Konczal, Karl Smith, Lisa Donner), did a session at Netroots Nation on monetary policy, and how the progressive left (including Democratic lawmakers) needs to saddle up and counter the destructive right-wing influence in this area.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.netrootsnation.org/nn_events/nn-12/organizing-federal-reserve/">Why the Fed is the Most Important Economic Issue You Know Nothing About</a></p>
<p><strong>This is a big deal.</strong> Monetary policy often, even usually, has a far more potent effect on national well-being and the distribution of wealth and income than the fiscal policy that progressives consider to be so important. (At least in the short- to medium term.) Those fiscal issues <em>are</em> important. But ignoring monetary policy is like ignoring coal plants in discussions of global warming.</p>
<p>Lefty idol Paul Krugman has given this example a zillion times: when Volcker opened the monetary taps in ’83 (after clamping down to tame inflation), the economy — and the employment situation — turned around hugely, <em>within months</em>. That was something of a special case, but it imparts the potential power and immediacy of monetary policy compared to many/most fiscal initiatives, which usually take quite a while to play out, and are rarely large enough to be big short-term game-changers.</p>
<p>But in the political realm, Democrats have largely <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/congress-to-bernanke-do-less-not-more/2012/06/07/gJQA8jNMLV_blog.html">ceded their voices to the ‘Pubs</a> (HT <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2012_06/poor_understanding_of_monetary037825.php">Ryan Cooper</a>) and their inflation hysteria (which survives like a zombie that won’t die, year after year, even while being wrong, year after year):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>“I wish you would take QE3 off the table,” said Texas Rep. Kevin Brady, the ranking Republican on the committee.</strong> “I wish you would look the markets in the eye and say that the Fed has done too much.” Similarly, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC) complained to Bernanke that many of the stimulative measures the Federal Reserve has taken “are giving us a false sense of security.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By contrast:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The ranking Democrat on the committee, Sen. Bob Casey, merely inquired, in a neutral tone, whether the Federal Reserve was planning to take further action.</strong> Bernanke simply replied that the Fed was still contemplating the matter, and a lot depended on whether “there will be enough growth going forward to make material progress on the unemployment rate.” (Fed officials meet on June 19 to discuss their next steps.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Fed is supposed to:</p>
<p>1. Provide for both stable prices and full employment.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2. Be politically independent.</p>
<p>But:</p>
<p>1. It has criminally abdicated its responsibility for employment in recent years, while fetishizing its inflation mandate.</p>
<p>2. It <em>is </em>subject to political pressure, as the quotations above make clear.</p>
<p>More proof of #2, from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/business/economy/02jobs.html?_r=2&#038;hp=&#038;pagewanted=all">Binyamin Applebaum</a> (HT <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/yglesias/2011/06/02/234098/lack-of-left-flank-to-monetary-policy-debate-has-the-fed-stuck-in-neutral/">Matt Yglesias</a>), quoting Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston:</p>
<blockquote><p>“We’ve done things that are quite unusual. We’re using tools that we have less experience with,” Mr. Rosengren said. <strong>“Most of the criticism has been that we’re being too accommodative. That is a concern that we have to put some weight on.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s time for progressives and congressional Democrats to start exerting some of that pressure. Pay attention, people!</p>

                                <p>The frequently brilliant Ashwin Parameswaran makes <a href="http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/06/04/the-case-against-monetary-stimulus-via-asset-purchases/">The Case Against Monetary Stimulus Via Asset Purchases</a>, and Nick Rowe <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2012/06/does-monetary-policy-have-bad-distributional-consequences.html">responds</a>. Ashwin <a href="http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/06/07/monetary-policy-targets-and-the-need-for-market-intervention/">replies</a>, analyzing “monetary policy as a threat strategy.”
<p>Nick’s view (in Ashwin’s words):</p>
<blockquote><p>…a credible threat will cause market expectations to adjust and negate the need for any actual intervention in markets by the central bank.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ashwin counters this view [my slight tweaks]:</p>
<blockquote><p>…expectations[-setting] only work[s] when there is a clear and credible set of actions that serve as the bazooka(s) to enforce these expectations.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think the key hinge here is the difference between the declarative, conditional, and subjunctive moods: the assumption that the actions <em>would</em> serve as a bazooka, <em>if</em>….</p>
<p>Nick seems to be assuming that the Fed’s promise is always credible — regardless of whether they have ever (or reliably) fired the bazooka in the past (followed up on their promises with OMO/QE actions/balance sheet changes) — because in theory the Fed <em>could</em> fire the bazooka, and (again, in theory) the bazooka <em>would</em> have the desired effect.</p>
<p>The promise <em>would</em> be credible <em>if: </em>1. the Fed has shown willingness to engage in those actions in the past in similar situations — by actually taking those actions — and 2. Those actions had the desired effect.</p>
<p>Nick’s view might make sense if the Fed were playing a one-round game. (They <em>could</em> do it, so market players have to assume that if necessary they can and will do it, and it will work.)</p>
<p>But it’s a repeated/ongoing game. I sed at Nick’s place:</p>
<p>It’s the <em>threat</em> that I will shoot you that causes you to turn over your wallet. Not the actual shooting. (The shooting can have the desired effect, but it’s unnecessary if the threat is credible.)</p>
<p>But you and I both know that I’m going to be stealing your wallet every day for the rest of our lives. If I don’t shoot you today when you refuse to hand it over, the threat won’t be credible tomorrow.</p>
<p>So yeah: the threat generally does the job. But the shooting can also do the job, and periodic actual shooting is necessary for the threat to do the job.</p>
<p>Nick replies:</p>
<blockquote><p>I threaten to go to the North of the herd of cattle, to drive them South. But if my threat is credible, and they head South, I actually follow the cattle south.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To which I replied:</p>
<blockquote><p>But if it’s a repeated game, if you never head north the threat isn’t credible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have to head north <em>sometimes</em>.</p>
<p>(This is all ignoring the question of whether actual balance-sheet changes even <em>would</em> have the desired effect, which market players seem decidedly uncertain about.)</p>
<p>Max, <a href="http://www.macroresilience.com/2012/06/04/the-case-against-monetary-stimulus-via-asset-purchases/#comment-113969">replying</a> to me in the comments at Ashwin’s, seems to perfectly encapsulate Nick’s (some-variety-of-)monetarist position:</p>
<blockquote><div>Steve, raising the inflation target is an “action”.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>Try this:</p>
<p>The Fed promises to raise inflation or NGDP to X (target or relative-to-trend level), doing whatever is necessary in the future to achieve that target/level. They do nothing else — make no significant changes to their balance sheet.</p>
<p>What they’re saying:</p>
<p>“If we have not achieved that target/level at our meeting six months or two years from now, we promise that we will again promise to do whatever is necessary in the future to achieve that target/level.”</p>
<p>Max: when the Fed promises to make future promises, is that an “action”?</p>
<p>It’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down#Origin">turtles all the way down</a>.</p>
<p>I hereby propose a new acronym to add to the lexicon of Fed and monetarist watchers: TATWD.</p>
<p>Nick takes his thinking to its logical conclusion (as he is quite admirably wont to do). Working with his north/south cattle metaphor, he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>if the conditional threat to buy assets is credible, the central bank would actually sell assets.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the Fed:</p>
<p>“We’re so confident in our ability to boost NGDP that were going to announce our intention to do so, and when we (inevitably) see the lead cow tending south, we’ll start selling in anticipation of our threat working perfectly. The rest of the herd, convinced by our displayed confidence, will turn and follow the leader.”</p>
<p>Does this seem likely?</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>“We’ll make our threat, and watch with satisfaction as the whole herd (inevitably) turns south. <em>Then</em> we’ll follow them by selling. We’ll never have to buy.”</p>
<p>As Market Monetarists will be the first to tell you (and as all will I think agree), the Fed is <em>extremely, even excessively reluctant</em> to turn north (more QE). The cattle — market players — know that.</p>
<p>If the Market Monetarists are right, Nick’s (and their) logic has a broken link: the cattle won’t believe the threat to go north because the cattle know that the Fed really, really doesn’t want to go north. (<a href="http://www.economist.com/comment/1449809#comment-1449809">My explanation of why they don’t want to.</a>)</p>
<p>Or, Nick’s logic is just obvious: if the economy gets better (the herd turns south) — for whatever reason(s) — the Fed will tighten by buying assets. No duh.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/06/malcolm-gladwell-unmasked-a-look-into-the-life-work-of-americas-most-successful-propagandist.html" target="_blank">Yves Smith</a> has a very long post on Malcolm Gladwell:<br />
<blockquote>Yves here. Yasha Levine and Mark Ames have launched the <a href="http://shameproject.com/">S.H.A.M.E. Project</a>, which stands for “Shame the Hacks who Abuse Media Ethics.” Its approach is to provide information about the background and funding sources of well-recognized journalists and pundits so that the public will be in a better position to recognize bias and hidden agendas in their reporting and analysis. You can find a S.H.A.M.E dossier on Gladwell <a href="http://shameproject.com/profile/malcolm-gladwell-2/">here</a>. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>By Yasha Levine, President of S.H.A.M.E., an investigative journalist and a founding <a href="http://exiledonline.com/yasha-levine/">editor of<em>The eXiled</em></a>. His work has been published by Wired, The Nation, Slate, The New York Observer and many others. He has made several guest appearances on MSNBC’s Dylan Ratigan Show.<br />… </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Malcolm Gladwell is the <em>New Yorker’s </em>leading essayist and bestselling author. <em>Time</em> magazine named Gladwell one of the world’s 100 most influential people. His books sell copies in the millions, and he is in hot demand as one of the nation’s top public intellectual and pop gurus. Gladwell plays his role as a disinterested public intellectual like few others, right down to the frizzy hairdo and smock-y getups. His political aloofness, high-brow contrarianism and constant challenges to “popular wisdom” are all part of his shtick. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But beneath Malcolm Gladwell’s cleverly-crafted ambiguity, beneath the branded facade, one finds, with surprising ease, a common huckster on the take. I say “surprising ease” because it’s all out there on the public record.</p></blockquote>

<p>Wealthy Non-Taxpayers &#8212; From 60 to Thousands in 30 Years</p>
<p>Bruce Bartlett provides the numbers, but it&#8217;s so much easier to see in a chart.</p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WyShLkF8Ta4/T9CKO32awpI/AAAAAAAAA3k/gs5NFvPS6Fo/s1600/wealthy+non-taxpayers+1977-2009.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="181" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WyShLkF8Ta4/T9CKO32awpI/AAAAAAAAA3k/gs5NFvPS6Fo/s320/wealthy+non-taxpayers+1977-2009.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
<p>Wealthy Non-Taxpayers 1977 to 2009, showing incomes over $200,000 per year.  Blue is percentage of total households over $200,000 paying no taxes, purple is numbers of high-income households paying no taxes. Numbers from chart here: <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/rich-nontaxpayers/">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/rich-nontaxpayers/</a>, drawn    <br />from IRS data.</p>
<p>On this chart, the percentage appears relatively stable with a low of 0.066 to a high of 0.529 (66 per 100,000 to 529 per 100,000) but actually that’s an eightfold increase, mostly accruing after 2004.<br />The numbers of households, however, leap like a gazelle after 2004, reaching a high of 22,000 high income households paying no taxes, from a low of only 60 in 1977.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I was just poking around FRED as I do when I can&#8217;t sleep and I discovered something which amazed me (I am often amazed by my ignorance).  Non mortgage delinguency rates are low.  In fact the delinquency rate on credit card loans of all commercial banks is the lowest on record (records only go back to 1991)</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-D4zDKo5vsos/T8_0LXyxXrI/AAAAAAAAAKI/GncAptmqT34/s1600/delinquent.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-D4zDKo5vsos/T8_0LXyxXrI/AAAAAAAAAKI/GncAptmqT34/s400/delinquent.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The blue curve shows delinquency rates on credit card loans by commercial banks.  The red line shows the even lower (but not quite lowest ever) delinquency rate on business loans.  If I put delinquency rates for single family home mortgages or all real estate secured loans, the graph would be hard to read as they dwarf the rates I graphed (and are at record highs).</p>
<p>Similarly the volume of total consumer loans of all commercial banks (&#8220;Total Consumer Credit Outstanding (TOTALSL), Monthly, End of Period, Seasonally Adjusted&#8221; again in blue) and of commercial and industrial loans ( &#8220;Commercial And Industrial Loans, All Commercial Banks (ACILACB), Quarterly, Not Seasonally Adjusted&#8221;, again in red) has recovered sharply after the recession.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6il-oMO1pS4/T8_4tFFZyWI/AAAAAAAAAKY/yygLB0X7sVM/s1600/credit.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6il-oMO1pS4/T8_4tFFZyWI/AAAAAAAAAKY/yygLB0X7sVM/s400/credit.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The decline in commercial and industrial loans was only 1.5 times that of the 2001 recession, the series turned back up sooner and has been increasing more rapidly.  There is no correction for inflation, these graphs are in millions of dollars (the legend is especially pointless because for some reason consumer loans are given in billions by default and I had to change the scale by hand).  </p>
<p>The remaining financial market problem seems to me to be extremely concentrated in financing real estate transactions especially housing.</p>
