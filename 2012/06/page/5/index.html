<p>The two luckiest people in American politics today are Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.  Each is running against a politician whose accomplishments while an elected head of the executive branch are a disappointment even to most of his own supporters.  If they were running against anyone else, they&#8217;d probably both go down in defeat, but considering who each of them is running against, it&#8217;s hard to imagine how either of them could lose.</p>

<p>Euro Area Inflation: A Very Slow Burn</p>
<p>Euro area consumer prices increased at a 2.4% annual pace in May, down 0.2 ppt from the 2.6% pace in April. Core inflation fell to 1.8% in May from 1.9% in April. Headline and core inflation peaked in the fourth quarter of 2011, and disinflation is underway.</p>
<p><strong>Euro area price inflation is burning out but at a very slow pace.</strong><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/ea_inflation1.jpg"><img alt="" height="353" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/ea_inflation1.jpg" width="566"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The 0.6 ppt differential between headline and core inflation is explained by energy and unprocessed food prices. In May, the energy component in HICP (harmonized index of consumer prices) fell 1.4% over the month and posted a 7.3% pace compared to May 2011. Energy prices peaked in April 2012, but base effects will prop up headline inflation through early 2013 even if energy prices go unchanged over the near term. That means headline inflation could be sticky for some time above 2%. But core inflation is not.</p>
<p>President Draghi often speaks of the upward pressure on inflation stemming from tax hikes across the various fiscal austerity programs. Stripping out the tax effects (this data is provided <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database#">by Eurostat</a>), the theoretical inflation rates in Portugal and Italy are 1.8ppt and 0.8ppt, respectively, below the headline rate. The downward pressure on inflation may quicken through next year, as the effects of VAT and various tax hikes wear off across the region…barring a miraculously robust economic recovery, of course.</p>
<p><em>(Note: In the chart below, the black line represents 0% difference between headline inflation and tax-adjusted inflation. For orange triangles above the black line, headline inflation is above tax-adjusted inflation, i.e., taxes are boosting aggregate prices.)</em><br /><em><br /></em><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/inf_taxadjusted3.jpg"><img alt="" height="488" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/inf_taxadjusted3.jpg" width="564"></a></p>
<p>Inflation takes time to build, so this disinflationary trend is unlikely to change anytime soon without significant policy accommodation.<br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong><br /><strong><em>Rebecca Wilder</em></strong></p>

<div>In an email exchange between Dan and me on Tuesday, I wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Btw, the Supreme Court has been amazingly slow this term in issuing opinions in high-profile cases.  Most of the opinions they’ve issued recently are on pretty esoteric issues; they’re important, but pretty inside-baseball.  A good example is an opinion they issued yesterday.  Here’s a great article on it at SCOTUSblog….  If you read it, I think you’ll see what I mean by esoteric and inside-baseball.  I do have to say—as the author of the article does—that Alito’s dissent is spot-on.  And, as the author says, it’s downright baffling that five justices signed on to Thomas’s wacky opinion.  The article indicates that Thomas apparently flipped Scalia after the oral argument.  Scalia had it right the first time.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/13/when-enough-is-enough/?hp&#038;gwh=AE467B2FA4F6F36F262DF6A64F9CCD88">an op-ed piece yesterday</a> in the New York Times, Linda Greenhouse, that paper’s longtime Supreme Court correspondent, who retired three or four years ago but still writes two or three op-ed commentaries a month there, mentioned the Court’s slow pace in issuing its “big” opinions this term.  Then she discusses an opinion that the Court issued on June 4 that, like most Supreme Court opinions, got little attention in the mainstream press but is nonetheless important. </div>
<div>
</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>Most Supreme Court opinions decide “procedural,” “jurisdictional” or “standard-of-judicial-review” questions, which sometimes involve constitutional questions, often under the guise of statutory-interpretation ones.  Often, the court treats these cases as though they present only issues of interpretation of a federal statute and pretend that the case does not implicate constitutional law even if really does.  But the case Greenhouse discussed, <i>Amour v. City of Indianapolis</i>, was squarely a constitutional-law case involving the Fourteen Amendment’s equal protection clause, and did not involve a federal statute but instead a Supreme Court-created standard of judicial review of the constitutionality of a government policy or law that has the effect of discriminating against some class of people. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Under the Court’s longtime equal-protection jurisprudence, the law is more tolerant of certain types of government discrimination than of other types of discrimination.  Laws or policies whose purpose is purely fiscal are among the types of government actions entitled to the most tolerant, or most “deferential,” level of judicial “scrutiny.”  Courts are not entitled to bar those laws or policies as violative of the equal protection clause unless there is no conceivable legally legitimate “rational basis” for the discrimination.   Greenhouse observes (as most liberal court watchers have recognized) that the conservative justices select out a few favorite conservative causes—most notably, the cause of George W. Bush becoming president instead of Al Gore, but also challenges to government affirmative action programs, and issues concerning religious speech in public schools (which Greenhouse doesn’t mention), and property-rights and tax cases—in which to champion the right of equal protection, while otherwise normally accepting virtually any stated basis for government discrimination as a sufficiently rational one to pass constitutional muster.  Of these conservative-favored types of cases, the deferential “rational basis”—i.e., almost anything goes—standard is applied only to the property and tax-type cases.  Conservative legal-movement types <i>hate</i>that it is.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><i>Armour</i>concerned a sewer improvement assessment in an Indianapolis subdivision.  Greenhouse summarizes:</div>
<p>
<div>The city gave the 180 property owners affected a choice of how to pay the $9,278 assessment: in a lump sum, or over time with interest. Most chose to pay over 10, 20 or 30 years. Three dozen paid up front, and the city then played them for suckers, announcing a year later that it was changing the way it financed sewer improvements and would issue bonds to cover most of the cost. It would forgive the indebtedness of the installment-payers. But the city refused to give the full-payers any of the refund they demanded.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The full-payers sued for a refund of all but the first year’s pro-rated assessment.  In a 6-3 opinion written by Breyer, the majority accepted as a sufficiently legitimate rational basis the city’s claim that the refund process would be difficult administratively and that the city then also would probably have to make similar refunds in other parts of the city.  Roberts wrote a strong dissent, but, as Greenhouse points out, it was fact-based rather than an attempt to change the law itself.  Roberts, joined by Scalia and Alito, said that the city’s proffered basis was not sufficiently legitimate under the rational-basis to pass equal protection muster.  But he did not advocate a change in equal protection legal doctrine itself; he did not suggest that the Court should abandon the rational-basis test for property-rights and other fiscal cases.  And Kennedy joined Breyer’s majority opinion.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which Greenhouse interprets as potentially indicative of the outcome of the Affordable Care Act case.  I do too, although I’d already concluded more than two months ago that Roberts and Kennedy probably would vote to uphold the individual-mandate provision.  I based that in part on <a href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/embarrass-the-future/">an earlier Greenhouse op-ed</a> in the Times, in which she discussed a comment by Kennedy late in the oral argument on the challenge to the individual mandate, and a comment by Roberts.  Neither comment had gotten much attention in the press coverage immediately following the argument (and I hadn’t read the lengthy transcript of the argument).  I also concluded once the dust had settled two or three weeks after the argument, and I’d read many articles and commentaries about it, that the majority might tacitly and effectively uphold the mandate’s constitutionality, by not formally making that ruling at this time but making it clear that eventually they will.  I still think that’s a possibility, but one that, because of recent historical findings by a Harvard professor published a few weeks after the argument, is less likely now. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In several posts on AB beginning about a year ago, I argued that the challengers’ Commerce Clause argument—that in enacting the ACA, Congress’ exceed its power under the Commerce Clause—was really a disguised Fifth Amendment “substantive due process” argument (liberty! freedom!), not a Commerce Clause argument at all.  Under the Supreme Court’s Commerce Clause jurisprudence, beginning in the mid-1930s with cases challenging the constitutionality of some of the New Deal legislation, and including a high-profile opinion issued in 2005, the ACA appears comfortably within the authority of Congress’s Commerce power.  It was that darned liberty thing that really was at issue: the slippery slope to Congress’s requiring the purchase of broccoli.   That is, this is a Fifth Amendment substantive due process argument, not a Commerce Clause argument.  As I pointed out, the “freedom” issue would be the same whether Congress achieved the end through it Commerce power or instead through its taxing power. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, in fact, the ACA’s enforcement mechanism—the penalty for not obtaining medical insurance arguably is a tax.  And since that’s the only enforcement mechanism—there is no provision for arrest and imprisonment, for example—the taxing power would suffice.  But that still would leave the issue of freedom! liberty!  And that slippery slope to broccoli-purchase mandates.  Unless, of course, the ACA mandate is no different, in a liberty! freedom! sense, whether enacted through the Commerce power or instead through the taxing power, than, say, Medicare and Social Security, but that a broccoli mandate, whether enacted through the Commerce power or instead through the taxing power is very different, and <i>would</i> be a violation of Fifth Amendment substantive due process (personal choice, liberty). 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Shortly after I wrote my first AB post making this argument, the first of two appellate-court opinions upholding the law under a virtually identical analysis was issued, both of them written by conservative-movement leading lights.  In the second of the two, issued last August, another leading-light movement-conservative judge dissented, but only from the determination that the law was within Congress’s Commerce Clause power, not from the conclusion that the law unconstitutionality infringed upon individual liberty.  That judge said that had Congress tweaked the statute even just slightly, enacting through the taxing power rather than through the commerce-regulating power, running the mandated insurance purchase through the government, the statute would be constitutional, both in that Congress would have the authority to enact it and that the mandate would not violate constitutional precepts of individual liberty.  And it turns out that the lawyer for the statute’s challengers agrees, as (apparently) does either Kennedy or Roberts (I can’t remember which).  And probably both do.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It was a third appellate case that the Supreme Court agreed to hear.  In that case, the Obama administration originally argued that the ACA’s penalty provisions was a tax, that the ACA was enacted under both the Commerce power and the taxing power—and that under a federal “jurisdictional” statute known as the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, which bars the courts from hearing a constitutional challenge to a federal taxing statute until after the tax is due, the courts lacked “jurisdiction” (legal authority) to consider the constitutional challenge at all until April 2015, when the first penalties under the ACA would be due.  But when that case on appeal, the administration reversed its position and said the penalty was, well, just a penalty, not a tax, and that the ACA was enacted solely under Congress’s Commerce power.  If so, the courts could hear the challenges to the Act.  That appellate court agreed, and in a split opinion held the mandate provision unconstitutional under what the majority said was a finding that Congress exceeded its Commerce power authority but what, the language of the opinion made clear, was really a finding that the mandate violated Fifth Amendment due process, or individual liberty, rights.  This, although the opinion didn’t mention the Fifth Amendment or due process.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>When the Supreme Court agreed to hear that case, it decided to hear as a threshold issue, although neither side had asked it to do so, whether the penalty is really a tax and therefore its constitutionality cannot be decided until 2015.  That issue was argued on the first of the three days of argument.  The next day, late in the argument on the mandate issue, Kennedy or Roberts asked the lawyer for the challengers whether an insurance mandate enacted under Congress’s taxing power would be constitutional—that is, whether Congress not only had the authority to enact such a mandate through the taxing power but also whether such a mandate would be constitutional; in other words, whether it wouldn’t violate a due process liberty right and lead to the possible forced purchase of broccoli. The lawyer said Congress could enact such a mandate through its taxing power, and apparently the justices didn’t dispute this. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So if a majority of the Court concludes that the mandate penalty is a tax, they can postpone an actual ruling on its constitutionality until after April 2015, while  strongly suggesting in its opinion this month that the mandate and its enforcement-mechanism penalty do not unconstitutionally violate individual liberty. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But I don’t think they’ll do that.  In an article titled “<a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/102620/individual-mandate-history-affordable-care-act">IfHealth Insurance Mandates Are Unconstitutional, Why Did the Founding FathersBack Them?</a>”, published in the New Republic in mid-April (three weeks after the Supreme Court arguments), Harvard law professor Einer Elhauge pointed out that on two occasions in this country’s earliest days, Congress, whose members the included several drafters of the Constitution, enacted statutes mandating that certain citizens purchase a private product.  In one instance the product was guns, in the service of a creating a citizens’ militia.  In the other instance, the product was medical insurance, which ship owners were required to buy for their seamen, enacted apparently under Congress’s Commerce power.  Neither law was thought to violate constitutional concepts of individual liberty.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which creates sort of an obstacle for the conservative “originalist” justices.  And which causes me to think that a majority will uphold the mandate as authorized under the Commerce power and that the penalty is, after all, not a tax but instead just a penalty.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which in turn causes me to disclaim my prediction before I’m even proven wrong.  After all, this type of prediction is worth the cost of the paper it’s not even written on. If that.
</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/06/14/does-the-american-middle-class-benefit-from-globalisation-who-cares/?ss=strategies-solutions">Tim Worstall</a>, in his <i>Forbes</i> blog, attacks my series (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/06/is-globalization-good-for-america.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/06/guest-post-is-globalization-good-for.html">here</a>) on whether globalization is good for America&#8217;s middle class. Not on the basis that he disagrees with my conclusion (though he does), but because, he argues, there are much more important facts about globalization than a decline in the economic well-being of the middle class in America and Europe. In particular, he points to the great decline in poverty among developing nations that have embraced globalization:<br />
<blockquote>This growth in incomes, in wealth, has been uneven, this is true. Largely speaking those places which have been taking part in globalisation, Indonesia, China, India, have been getting richer. Those that have not been, Somalia perhaps as an example, have not been.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s leave aside the fact that these successful countries are hardly poster children for the kinds of so-called &#8220;free-market&#8221; policies that Worstall espouses, a point made particularly well by <a href="http://dev.wcfia.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Rodrick_HowToSave.pdf">Dani Rodrik</a>. And in the spirit in which Worstall granted my claims for the sake of argument, let&#8217;s grant his as well. (But if you want to get down into the weeds on the extent to which poverty reduction claims may be overstated, take a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CFQQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.131.1901%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&#038;ei=JvvaT8f5FeKL2AXex-y1CA&#038;usg=AFQjCNHzCZL7pMbS21SuVfstm5bba2rNVg&#038;sig2=T1lGkVMos_JBJEjdoOnPGg">Robert Wade&#8217;s work</a>.)  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Here is the crux of Worstall&#8217;s argument:  <br />
<blockquote>So I would actually posit that whether the American, or European, or rich world, middle class benefits from globalisation is actually an incomplete question. Incomplete enough to be the wrong question. Almost to the point that the answer is “who cares?”.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The correct question is what is the distribution of all of the costs and all of the benefits of globalisation? To which my answer would be that a generation, perhaps even two generations, of stagnating lifestyles for the already rich, those middle classes, looks like a reasonable enough cost to pay for the other thing that is happening: the abolition of absolute human poverty in the rest of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>First, I think we should certainly care when hundreds of millions of people are suffering unnecessarily. Yes, unnecessarily, because contrary to Worstall&#8217;s claim, we are not trading off reduced economic well-being for hundreds of millions of middle class people for the lessened poverty of billions of other people. Indeed, the two are happening simultaneously, but as <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/4510.html">Ronald Rogowki</a> pointed out in <i>Commerce and Coalitions</i>, it is perfectly feasible to have rich country winners compensate rich-country losers and still have all of them be better off from trade.</p>
<p>Politically, it is a hard row to how, as Rogowki pointed out: the winners from expanding trade increase their political power as a result of their increased income, making compensatory policies less likely. But ending globalization&#8217;s harm to the middle class in rich nations does not <i>require</i> us to take anything away from poorer people, not if you accept the theory of comparative advantage and the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem. It <i>does</i> require us to figure out a political solution to the problems faced by the losers, which as we can see in the United States is made more difficult by the decline of unions and by the <i>Citizens United</i> Supreme Court decision.  </p>
<p>And second, we should care about the U.S. middle class (and Europe&#8217;s, for that matter) because how they react to their situation politically will have enormous consequences for the world economy and world politics. If the U.S. comes up with a &#8220;Smoot-Hawley&#8221; response to its economic problems, that would undo a lot of the gains Worstall sees as flowing from globalization, a point made recently by <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it">Dani Rodrik</a> (via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/06/links-for-06-14-2012.html">Mark Thoma</a>). Even more ominously, in both the U.S. and Europe, we see increasing political polarization and the rise of nationalist political parties and movements, as noted by <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/14/historical-echoes/">Paul Krugman</a>. Economic decline is a scary thing, and people&#8217;s reactions to it can get downright ugly, to put it mildly.  </p>
<p>For both of these reasons, then, what happens to the middle class in the U.S. and Europe will have repercussions far beyond those acknowledged by Worstall.   </p>

<p>Guest Post:   Is globalization good for America&#8217;s middle class? Part 2</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Part 1</a>, I examined what economic theory has to say about the winners and losers from trade. The main conclusion is based on the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem: Because the United States is labor scarce in a global perspective, an expansion of trade will reduce the real wages of labor. As we have seen, this theoretical prediction has been borne out as <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/basics-real-wages-remain-below-their.html">real wages remain below their peak</a> level for the 39th year running.<br />    <br />In this post, I analyze what I consider to be the other main element of globalization, the expansion of the mobility of capital. Just as transportation innovation and cost declines made trade easier, they also make it easier for owners of capital to locate it in a broader range of places than 30 or 40 years ago. Similarly, the decline in communication costs make it easier for owners of capital to coordinate production on a global scale as well as offering additional ways of moving financial capital (think <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/tax-havens-cost-middle-class-untold.html">tax havens</a>).<br />    <br />Note that I have said nothing about actual movements of capital. Simply the <i>ability</i> to move capital strengthens capital owners in their negotiations with business and labor, because it makes the threat of moving credible and thereby gives companies greater bargaining power. <a href="http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&#038;context=cbpubs">Kate Bronfenbrenner</a> showed clearly that after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993, companies more frequently resorted to threats in their bargaining with workers, even to the point of violating the National Labor Relations Act by threatening to move during union organizing drives. In this blog, I have previously discussed the case of Boeing&#8217;s establishment of a <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/boeing-in-south-carolina-huge-subsidies.html">Dreamliner plant in South Carolina</a> and admitting it was due to workers in Washington state exercising their right to strike, a form of retaliation that was a prima facie violation of the Act.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Similarly, we have seen how companies have used the threat of relocation to extract subsidies from state and local governments. <a href="http://clawback.org/2012/01/05/sears-tax-breaks-and-job-loss-like-we-said/">Sears</a>, with its $275 million (nominal) retention package from Illinois, is just the most egregious in recent years. That package alone could support 550 state jobs at $50,000 a year for 10 years (assuming no raises, something pretty common for state workers lately though unlikely to last 10 years). And remember, Sears did this in 1989 as well, when it got $178 million not to move out of state.<br />    <br />More generally, who should win and who should lose from the growth of capital mobility? One possibility is that it would simply speed up the effects of trade. If Mexico had needed to wait for the growth of domestic entrepreneurs, it could not have expanded its exports to the U.S. nearly as rapidly as in the actual situation where U.S. companies could provide the money. In that case, we would simply expect the effect of heightened capital mobility to be the same as the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem.<br />    <br />But this would not explain why European labor appears as opposed to globalization as U.S. unions. Western Europe is labor abundant, so we would expect western European worker to benefit from the expansion of trade. Yet one does not have to look hard at all to see that European unions are not in love with globalization. The right answer now might be that those who are mobile win in the global economy, while those who are immobile lose. While capital is mobile geographically, governments are bound to their location. Workers, even where they have significant legal opportunities to move, as in the European Union, are still restricted in their mobility by their language abilities or lack thereof, and by the common desire to live near their families (another way in which corporations are not people, by the way). And it is not as if European capital can only be invested in the EU.<br />     <br />This is consistent with studies of the effect on home country labor of foreign investment (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Multinational-Enterprise-Economic-Cambridge-Literature/dp/0521478588">Richard Caves</a>&#8216; <i>Multinational Enterprise and Economic Analysis</i>): reduced employment because exports are replaced with foreign production, some possible increased employment due to supplying goods and services to foreign subsidiaries, but at best the result is a wash and more likely the net effect is negative.<br />    <br />If this is right, U.S. workers may have the worst of both worlds: they are harmed by expanding trade, and they are harmed by being less mobile than capital. While this does not explain the political changes that have happened in the U.S. since 1970 (though it is certainly relevant), it gives us a pretty good handle on the economic market pressures that the middle class needs to address politically. I will have more to say about these issues in future posts. </p>

                                <p>The Fed’s credibility is obviously important. If people believe that they can and will do what they say they’re going to do — and that it will have the desired effect — they can affect the the real economy (at least short-term) by just making promises — Open Mouth Operations. (Though they must actually do things to their balance sheet, sometimes — rather than just promising to make future promises — to avoid the <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/turtles-all-the-way-down-are-fed-promises-actions-how-about-promises-to-make-promises-game-theory-edition.html">Turtles All The Way Down</a> problem.)
<p>Also obvious: the Fed has great inflation-fighting cred. They’ve fetishized inflation and that credibility for thirty years. People feel damned confident that they can and will successfully stomp on price spikes — especially wages. That’s what they <em>do. </em>That fixation has continued even through four years in which runaway inflation has manifestly <em>not</em> been a credible threat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, their unemployment-fighting cred is in the tank. If they announced today that they’re going to do whatever is necessary to bring unemployment down to X%, people would seriously question their ability to do so, even their future commitment to doing so.</p>
<p>Tyler Cowen <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/05/why-monetary-policy-matters-less-every-day.html">agrees</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed, at least right now, is not able to make a credible commitment toward a significantly more expansionary policy for very long. … The market expectation has become “the Fed can/will only do so much.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? Because in their frantic obsession with inflation (<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/inflation-credibility-and-expectations-again-some-more.html#creditors">explanation here</a>), they missed their chance to demonstrate their unemployment-fighting moxie. The time to do that was 2008 and 2009, when 1. unemployment was spiking and 2. monetary policy had a lot more traction on unemployment. They could have <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/scott-sumner-the-2009-stimulus-was-sabotaged-by-the-fed.html">not sabotaged the fiscal efforts</a>.</p>
<p>Again, Tyler agrees:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed already has failed to act, for whatever reasons.  That makes it all the harder to achieve the credible commitment now.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now people may be confused, thinking that because the Fed <em>didn’t</em> do what was needed to fight unemployment, it <em>couldn’t have</em>. This could result in them believing that it <em>can’t, now.</em> This is obviously faulty reasoning, but the conclusion could still be correct.</p>
<p>I don’t know for sure. Two questions, using a fairly extreme scenario to make the conundrum clear:</p>
<p>1. If the Fed <em>had</em> bought a trillion dollars of S&#038;P 500 stocks in 2008, would it have prevented (or greatly reduced) the unemployment carnage?</p>
<p>2. If the Fed bought a trillion dollars of S&#038;P 500 stocks <em>today</em>, would it bring unemployment down significantly?</p>
<div>On #2, Tyler thinks not — that action today would have a fifth or a tenth of the effect that ’08 action would have had — for several reasons, mainly having to do with reduced potential. (Arguably caused by the Fed’s inaction.)</div>
<p>But one thing seems clear: that inaction (or sabotage, if you prefer) seriously damaged the Fed’s growth-enhancing, unemployment-fighting credibility. By sabotaging fiscal, it has sabotaged its own ability to reduce unemployment (or increase NGDP) by simply making promises.</p>

<p>Euro Area ‘Hard Data’ Catching Up with the ‘Soft Data’ – Industrial Production</p>
<p><a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-13062012-AP/EN/4-13062012-AP-EN.PDF"><img alt="" height="186" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/ip_sector-300x186.jpg" width="300"></a></p>
<p>Euro area industrial production (ex construction) declined 0.8% in the month of April. Across the major sectors, the largest decline occurred in capital goods; however, the trend in consumer and intermediate goods is worse than that of capital goods.</p>
<p>The regional divergence is clear, as the two-month trend in industrial production – I use the two month trend since this series is quite volatile month-to-month – is strongest in Luxembourg, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Ireland, and weakest in the Netherlands, Spain, Estonia, and Greece.  (much more below the fold)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/ip_country.jpg"><img alt="" height="468" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/ip_country.jpg" width="530"></a></p>
<p>Another way to look at the divergence is to plot German production against the rest of Europe. It’s evident that Germany, with its large 35% weight in this index, is propping up the average. German industrial production is 10% above 2005 levels, while the Euro area ex Germany’s industrial production is 8% below levels in 2005. That’s an 18 ppt divergence.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/ip_europe_ex1.jpg"><img alt="" height="321" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/ip_europe_ex1.jpg" width="516"></a></p>
<p>Finally, a comparison to the US is illustrative. The US industrial sector is outperforming that in Europe, as production continues its positive trend with relatively easy fiscal and monetary policy accommodating the private sector’s desire to save. The US production base is 2% above that in 2005, while that in the euro area (including Germany) is 2% below.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/ip_ea_us.jpg"><img alt="" height="321" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/06/ip_ea_us.jpg" width="516"></a></p>
<p>In all, the euro area April industrial production release points to further divergence in growth prospects and a very weak start to the second quarter of 2012. The ‘hard data’ seems to be catching up with the weak ‘soft data’, like the PMIs (see <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/edwardhugh/2012/06/03/global-manufacturing-growth-shudders-towards-a-halt/">Edward Hugh’s summary </a>on the Euro area PMI).<br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong><br /><strong><em>Rebecca Wilder</em></strong><br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong><br />crossposted with  <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2012/06/13/euro-area-hard-data-catching-up-with-the-soft-data-industrial-production/">The Wilder View&#8230;Economonitors</a></p>

                                <p>Or: <strong>Yes, The Rich Really Are Different</strong>
<p><strong></strong>You’ve all probably seen the depressing reports from the newly issued 2010 edition of the Fed’s triennial <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/econresdata/scf/scfindex.htm">Survey of Consumer Finance</a>, in particular the <strong>39% drop in median household net worth, ’07-’10.</strong></p>
<p>Here’s a picture (click for larger):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SCF-2010-net-worth.png"><img title="SCF 2010 net worth" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SCF-2010-net-worth-480x328.png" alt="" width="480" height="328"></a></p>
<p>The well-off have done <em>fine</em>. <strong>In the greatest economic downturn in eighty years, their median net worth went <em>up.</em></strong></p>
<p><em></em>This doesn’t even touch on the top 1%, .1%, or .01%, of course. It’s <em>very</em> hard to calculate net worth for those folks as a group. But judging by their incomes, they’re doing just fine too:</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/2012/03/15/the-richest-get-richer/"><img title="incomes" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/files/2012/03/US_AVGINCOMES0312_SC.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="410"></a></p>
<p>I can’t comprehend how anyone can play word games about “incentives” to suggest that this situation, created quite intentionally over the past three decades, is or could be conducive to widespread national prosperity.</p>
<p>I can only assume that those who do so don’t actually care about widespread national prosperity.</p>

                                <div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-17r0AbsSd64/T9jpIPa9AJI/AAAAAAAACI0/5sJ1A0SrQ1k/s1600/Clipboard03+OIL+GAS+GROWTH.bmp" imageanchor="1"></a></div>
<p>I regularly see right wingers and republicans claiming that we should allow unlimited oil and gas drilling because it would create so many jobs.</p>
<p>If you look at the recent data on growth in employment in oil &#038; gas drilling it appears they may have a good argument.  Over the past year employment in oil &#038; gas drilling rose 11.3%,  only down slightly from its January peak of 14.5%.  Employment growth in the sector almost reached its  1980 peak growth rate of 16.5 %.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-17r0AbsSd64/T9jpIPa9AJI/AAAAAAAACI0/5sJ1A0SrQ1k/s1600/Clipboard03+OIL+GAS+GROWTH.bmp"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-17r0AbsSd64/T9jpIPa9AJI/AAAAAAAACI0/5sJ1A0SrQ1k/s320/Clipboard03+OIL+GAS+GROWTH.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>In March, oil &#038; gas extraction employed some 193,000 people.  Assume the optimists are right and that over the next 8 years oil &#038; gas extraction  employment will grow at near record annual rate of 12.5%.    By 2020 this sector&#8217;s employment would reach some 470,000  &#8212; more than double current levels.</p>
<p>To put this in perspective, assume continued sluggish economic growth of some 2% to 3% real GDP growth and annual employment growth of around 1.6%. .  By 2020 this would bring the unemployment rate under 5%.</p>
<p>Currently, oil &#038; gas exploration employment is some 0.15% of total payroll employment.  That is correct, zero point fifteen percent, not fifteen percent.  Under the assumed sluggish growth scenaro<br />oil &#038; gas employment would reach a new record share of 0.32%f of payroll employment in 2020..   The some 289,000 increase in oil &#038; gas extraction employment would account for about 1.6% of the total employment gains. </p>

<p>It is like last years record real GDP growth in North Dakota. Because of the oil boom in 2011 real GDP<br />grew 7.5% in North Dakota, far stronger than any  state.  This very rapid growth caused North  Dakota&#8217;s share of total US real GDP to rise from 0.24%  to 0.26%  </p>
<p>So even if you allow them to have their extremely optimistic  assumptions, unlimited oil &#038; gas extraction is unlikely to have a significant impact on total employment growth.</p>
