                                <p>
<div></div>
<div>“Which Jamie Dimon will appear before the Senate Banking Committee in Washington on Wednesday?” asks Reuters BreakingViews columnist Rob Cox <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/breakingviews/2012/06/12/jamie_dimon_should_come_out_swinging_in_senate_.html">in a Slate piece</a>.  “The self-effacing JPMorgan boss offering apologies for his bank losing at least $2 billion on bum trades?,” he asks? “Or the combative JPMorgan leader who just a year ago publicly challenged the chairman of the Federal Reserve over regulation?”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Cox recommends the latter, which is why the piece is titled “Jamie Dimon Should Come Out Swinging in the Senate.”  He worries that “a mealy submission from Dimon may help effectively nationalize the American banking industry for good.”  He asks us to “[c]onsider the implicit message the senators who called Dimon before them are sending: that banks must answer to the nation for any losses they incur – and that watchdogs and regulations should somehow be able to prevent them.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I did. This required me to consider his claim that a mealy submission from Dimon may help effectively nationalize the American banking industry for good (meaning “permanently,” not “beneficially”).  He’s saying that the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall statute or a meaningful implementation of the Volker Rule—separating investment banking from retail banking and barring federally-insured banks from speculating with depositors’ money (which is what JPMorgan did)—would amount to nationalization of the American banking industry.  And he’s saying that a law capping the size of federally-insured banks would do that. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>After all, the reason for the Senate Banking Committee hearing tomorrow is that Congress is considering enacting laws that would do those very things—laws that would return the banking industry to some semblance of what it was for the period between 1933 and the 1990s, before bank-merger mania and the repeal of the relevant parts of the Glass-Steagall Act so changed the nature of the American banking industry.  You know, to the way banks were during that long postwar period of economic stagnation caused by the nationalized banking system we had back then, until de-nationalization returned the industry to the free-enterprise system.  In recognition of the fall of Communism, I guess.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I also considered the horrors of a return to that Commie banking system of the postwar era, when watchdogs and regulations somehow were, in fact, able to prevent most large banks from failing and their depositors from needing that FDIC insurance.  I shuttered.  No, sir!  Wouldn’t want to see <i>that</i>!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>An effective Volcker Rule and the reenactment of Glass-Steagall might,of course, cause banks to start using those deposits to lend money to businesses, since credit-default-swap speculation no longer would be an option for them.  But we wouldn’t want banks to start acting like banks rather than hedge funds again, would we?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Dimon may come out swinging, but I expect that it will be the Democratic senators who will hit it out of the park. Dimon’s fast ball isn’t what it was.
</p>
</div>

<p>It speaks volumes of Robert Barro’s “scholarship” that I am able to reprint this letter word for word in response to his latest screed. (Just insert a link to his latest where you see fit, and adjust the GDP percentages a bit.)</p>

<p>Dear Professor Barro:</p>
<p>I’m compelled to write after following your writings for many years, in response to your recent <a href="http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/barro/files/WSJ_09_0122_GovSpendingNoFreeLunch.pdf">article</a> (PDF) in the <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, your <a href="http://business.theatlantic.com/2009/02/an_interview_with_robert_barro.php">interview</a> with Conor Clark on the <em>Atlantic</em> web site, and your <a href="http://clivecrook.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/dismal_science_revisited.php">published email interchange</a> with Clive Crook on his <em>Atlantic</em> blog.</p>

<p>In their 2003 meta-analysis (<a href="http://econpapers.repec.org/scripts/redir.pl?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tinbergen.nl%2Fdiscussionpapers%2F02028.pdf;h=repec:dgr:uvatin:20020028">PDF</a>), Nijkamp and Poot demonstrated (with multiple references to your works) that in aggregate, dozens of your colleagues who have actually studied this issue support those results — in spades.</p>
<p><strong>In prosperous, developed countries, smaller government does not yield faster growth.</strong> As you and your colleagues have demonstrated, <strong>that belief is a myth</strong>. (The U.S. has been taxing about 28% of GDP for decades — local, state, and federal combined. Europe has been taxing 40%. But growth rates have been the <a href="http://asymptosis.com/europe-vs-us-wh.html">same</a>.)</p>
<p><strong>But you have constantly promulgated that myth</strong>–and you continue to do so–in your scholarly and popular writings, and public pronouncements. This is especially concerning because your statements receive widespread attention and credence regarding taxation and spending policies in the U.S.–which is a decidedly rich country.</p>
<p>Facts on the ground:</p>
<p>In your 2000 paper you broke out growth rates for a panel of Rich countries, of OECD countries, and of Poor countries (<a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/5/49/1825455.pdf">PDF</a>: table 1.1, page 35). Results:</p>
<p><strong>Correlations: Government consumption versus growth in real GDP per capita</strong><br />Rich-countries: -.014 (.042)<br />OECD-countries: .015 (.040)<br />Poor countries: -.167 (.030)<br />All countries: -.157 (.022)</p>
<p>For prosperous countries the results are one positive (more government consumption, faster growth), one negative, neither even vaguely significant.</p>
<p>Only the poor-country panel shows significance. So the negative correlation for the overall sample is completely dominated by the poor-country results. (Not surprisingly: The correlation for poor countries is relatively large, and poor countries in the sample — which are weighted equally with rich countries — greatly outnumber the rich countries.)</p>
<p>As far as I can determine, your 2000 findings regarding rich versus poor countries have been completely absent from your other (widely-cited) works in the field.* Your conclusions in those works have been based on your full sample of approximately 100 countries, which is dominated by poor countries.</p>
<p>You consistently state that greater government consumption reduces growth rates, with some iteration of the following graph.</p>
<p><img title="6a00d8345bb36969e20111686666a5970c-800wi" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/6a00d8345bb36969e20111686666a5970c-800wi.png" alt="6a00d8345bb36969e20111686666a5970c-800wi" width="365" height="390"></p>
<p>Even in your 2000 paper, you make no mention of your own findings therein, but rather make the following blanket — and importantly misrepresentative — statement (page 12).</p>
<p>Table 1, column 1 indicates that the effect of the government consumption ratio, G/Y [consumption as a percent of GDP &#8211;Steve], on growth is significantly negative. The coefficient estimate implies that an increase in G/Y of 10 percentage points would reduce the growth rate on impact by 1.6% per year.</p>
<p>What about columns 3, 4, and 5? Is this statement  true for prosperous countries like the U.S.? And is it wise to make recommendations about U.S. policy based on findings dominated by countries like Thailand and Mozambique?</p>
<p>Can you explain why you have ignored your own findings — seemingly swept them under the rug — and consistently made statements contradicted both by those findings and by the aggregate findings of your colleagues who have, like you, actually studied this issue?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Steve</p>
<p>* I&#8217;ve gone back through much of your work, but the key works on this subject are Determinants of Economic Growth (1998), &#8220;Recent Developments in Endogenous Growth Theory&#8221; (chapter, 2000), Economic Growth in a Cross Section of Countries (2001), and Economic Growth (2003).</p>

                                <p>Damn, Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/11/financial-repression-chinese-style/">beat me to this</a> yesterday. I thought I would be bringing in a fascinating piece from the fringes of the Australioblogosphere.
<p><a href="http://brontecapital.blogspot.com.au/2012/06/macroeconomics-of-chinese-kleptocracy.html">Bronte Capital: The Macroeconomics of Chinese kleptocracy</a>.</p>
<p>My basic take is the same as Paul’s:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have no idea whether this John Hempton piece on China is at all right, but it’s a terrific read, and provides food for thought.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The logic of the piece is very much dependent on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loanable_funds">loanable-funds model</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Chinese kleptocracy – and indeed several major trends in the global economy – depend on copious quantities of savings at negative expected rates of return by middle and lower income Chinese.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we saw <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-central-flaw-in-krugmans-argument-against-keen.html">quite clearly</a> in <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/46944145/Paul_Krugman_vs_MMT_The_Great_Debate">The Great Keen-Krugman Debate</a>, Paul is a firm believer in that model (and obviously Hempton is too). I and many others (notably <a href="http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2012/04/02/blog-observations-on-krugman/">Keen</a>) have suggested that <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/no-saving-does-not-increase-the-supply-of-loanable-funds.html">the model is ridiculous and nonsensical on its face</a>.</p>
<p>If we look at the Hempton piece through other eyes — MMT for instance — does it still hold up? How can we rewrite it to explain things better while retaining its rather convincing insights?</p>
<p>Now here’s what’s fascinating: my hat tip goes to a post two days ago by <a href="http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2012/06/10/the-macroeconomics-of-chinese-kleptocracy/">Craig Tindale</a> at … Steve Keen’s blog — a blog where you find little patience for the loanable funds model.</p>
<p>1. Why do we find an implicitly approving link over there?</p>
<p>2. How did Krugman come across this piece? Has he taken to reading Keen?</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Vast majorities of Americans don’t trust their institutions.</strong> <em>That’s not mostly because our institutions perform much worse than they did in 1925 and 1955</em>, when they were widely trusted. It’s mostly because more people are cynical and <strong>like to pretend that they are better than everything else around them.</strong> <strong>Vanity has more to do with rising distrust than anything else.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or more aptly: <strong>rising distrust has more to do with vanity than anything else</strong>.</p>
<p>This nicely encapsulates an explanation I’ve been coming to for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What" s_the_matter_with_kansas>what’s the matter with Kansas</a> – an explanation for the frantic, desperate-seeming, reality-denying, and self-contradictory rhetorical contortions that tea partiers and the Republican right constantly resort to.</p>
<p>They’re protecting, and stroking, their egos.</p>
<p>If America is exceptional, then <em>they’re </em>exceptional. If Sarah Palin isn’t exceptional, then they might not be — probably aren’t, in fact.</p>
<p>If government programs have been necessary to their success, their success might not be primarily a result of their own noble efforts.</p>
<p>If well-off people’s self-serving belief system results in <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/american-exceptionalism-238-opportunity-not.html">less economic opportunity</a>, they are hard-pressed to plausibly trumpet their clear-eyed pragmatism and serene virtue in empowering and enriching the deserving poor.</p>
<p>If the marketplace does not reliably reward personal merit, their place in life (however modest or grand), has little to do with their personal merit.</p>
<p>If CEO performance is <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=ZuKTvERuPG8C&#038;lpg=PP1&#038;dq=kahneman%20thinking%20fast%20and%20slow&#038;pg=PA205#v=onepage&#038;q=%22ceo%20does%20not%20control%22&#038;f=false">largely a matter of luck</a> (right company, right time), the heroical, captains-of-industry self-regard of those CEOs is a delusion.</p>
<p>It’s easy to add to this list. And it’s also easy to see why stoking this conflagration of self-regard — telling voters that “they are better than everything else around them” (notably government) — would be an excellent political strategy. (<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/how-can-you-tell-if-a-politician-is-lying.html">How do you know when a politician is lying?</a>)</p>
<p>Combine this strategy with the <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-reaganomics-strategy-a-legacy-of-debt.html">world’s oldest political pander</a> — “I’ll cut your taxes!” — and you have a pretty good explanation for thirty years of otherwise-inexplicable political ascendancy.</p>

<p>The Italian Economy Is Sliding</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://www.istat.it/en/archive/64561">I.Stat released </a>the breakdown of Q1 2012 real GDP for the Italian economy. Weak external demand plus a precipitous drop in private sector spending dragged the headline real gross domestic product (GDP) 0.8% over the quarter (3.2% at an annualized rate). The highlights are the following:
<ul>
<li>Gross fixed capital formation (investment net of inventory formation) fell 3.6% over the quarter, or 13.7% at an annualized rate. This was the fastest quarterly rate of decline since Q1 2009 when GFCF fell 5% over the quarter. </li>
<li>Private consumption dropped 1.0% over the quarter, or 3.9% at an annualized rate </li>
<li>Imports fell 3.6%, or 13.6% at an annualized rate </li>
<li>Exports fell 0.6%, or 2.2% at an annualized rate </li>
<li>The only positive contribution to domestic spending was government consumption, which increased 0.4% over the quarter, or 1.4% at an annualized rate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Italy’s real GDP is only 1.1% higher than its lowest point during the recession (Q2 2009). Furthermore, gross fixed capital formation has dropped at an increasing rate for four consecutive quarters. Hope for stabilization eludes, as the current business confidence survey continues its decent – IStat manufacturing confidence was 86.2 in May, which was the second lowest level since the outset of the EMU and well below the 100 average since 2000. Broadly speaking, the economy is imploding.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t pin your hopes on exports.</strong> The contribution of exports to real GDP growth has dropped for two consecutive quarters, bucking a trend of positive contribution since the middle of 2009. The only reason that the net export contribution was positive in Q1 was due to the +1% contribution coming from a sharp decline in imports. This cannot be sustained, as the crisis of confidence has begun.<br />(Note: In the chart below, if real import growth is positive, then the contribution is negative; and if the real import growth is negative, then the contribution is positive.)</p>

<p>This is a product of failed policy at the Euro area level, and something needs to be done to break the positive feedback loop.<br /><em><strong><br /></strong></em><br /><em><strong>Rebecca Wilder</strong></em><br /><em><strong><br /></strong></em><br />crossposted with   <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2012/06/11/the-italian-economy-is-sliding/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=the-italian-economy-is-sliding">The Wilder View&#8230;Economonitors</a></p>

<p>A couple of weeks ago President Obama said that the private sector was doing fine.</p>
<p>Needless to say this was subject to much criticism from some sources.  But is that criticism justified ?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see what the data says.  This chart of real business output  compares output in the five long cycles since WW II &#8212; it omits the 1950s and 1970s because of the multiple recessions in those decades. What the chart shows is that compared to the two long cycles before the Great Moderation that  growth is much weaker but compared to the 1990s and 2000s cycles, growth this cycle is essentially identical.<br />In other words there is no difference between private sector growth now and in the 2000s that Larry Kudlow called the Goldilocks economy.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s see what happened to private sector profits in these cycles.</p>
<p>Profits this cycle appear to be about the same as in earlier long cycles. </p>

<p>What about business investments?</p>
<p>Investments are much stronger than the were in the early 2000s and  roughly the same as they were in the 1990s.  It should be no surprise  that investment are weaker than in the 1960s or 1980s</p>

<p>Private payrolls look much like investments &#8212; weaker than in the old style recoveries in the 1960s and 1980s but about the same as in the 1990s and stronger than in the early 2000s.</p>

<p>To finish, I would like to point out that  many of the comments about the private sector economy are based on an erroneous calculation of private sector real GDP.  They seem to think that one can estimate private sector GDP by subtracting government consumption from total GDP.  But that is not correct.<br />Remember, we do not directly estimate output.  Rather the GDP data measures consumption and adjust that for changes in trade and inventories to indirectly estimate output.  For example if Boeing builds a 747 or Ford builds a truck it does not show up in  GDP as output.  It shows up in the GDP accounts in one of five ways.</p>
<p>1. If they sell it to an individual it is recorded in personal consumption expenditures.<br />2. If they sell it to a business it shows up as business fixed investment.<br />3. If they export it is recorded in the trade account.<br />4. If they do not sell it , the jet or truck is counted as an increase in inventories.<br />5. If they sell it to the government it is recorded as government consumption.</p>
<p>But if the jet or truck or some other good or service is sold to the government it still counts as private sector output just the same as if they had exported it or sold it to an individual or a business.  In the GDP accounts, government consumption includes two types of transactions. One is government  employment like a policeman or a soldier.  The other is government purchases of goods or services from private business.  So to correctly estimate private sector GDP you need to subtract only government employment but not government purchases from total GDP.  This makes a big difference in the size and growth of the private economy.  Every quarter that government purchases grow faster than private sector output it causes the estimate of private GDP derived by  subtracting government consumption from total GDP  to understate private GDP.  This method of estimating private GDP generates a highly biased estimate.  For example,using the correct methodology shows that over the past decade private sector real GPD expanded almost 20% while the estimate derived from subtracting  all government  consumption from total real  GDP  concludes that private sector real GDP contracted some -16%.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry, you do not have to find data that breaks government consumption into the two categories to correctly estimate private output.  The BEA does it for you and estimates private output.  But you will not find it in the GDP accounts.  Rather, it is in the productivity data provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics under the heading called business output.</p>

<p>Which Spending Is Easier To Cut And By What Level Of Government?</p>
<p>Back from his break, our former co-blogger, Dean Baker at Beat the Press, takes down WaPo ed page editor, Fred Hiatt, for his pushing yet again for cutting Social Security because it is supposedly &#8220;easy to do&#8221; in contrast to medical spending, with Hiatt pinning the blame on Dems for not supporting cutting either.  Baker notes that putting med costs in line with those in other countries would alone completely eliminate the federal budget deficit, and that Dems are not the ones opposing cuts to drug companies or &#8220;overpaid medical specialists.&#8221; <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/beat-the-press/why-does-Fred-Hiatt-say-the-democrats-are-opposed-to-giving-less-money-to-drug-companies-and-overpaid-medical-specialists">CEPR</a>   Hiatt barely nods at GOP opposition to tax increases and the possibility of cutting defense spending, even though the US is winding down some of its current active wars.<br />    <br />Dean kindly avoids noting that Hiatt is part of a group of established media mavens in Washington who long ago convinced themselves that somehow not only is Social Security &#8220;in crisis,&#8221; but that somehow it is the easiest program to cut (future) spending on politically, although that will do nearly nothing to limit near-term deficits and that there is nearly zero support among the public of both parties for such an action, and that efforts by various politicians of both parties in recent years to do this have ended up as embarrassing failures.  But this gang does not give up easily, including Hiatt, back at it yet again.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Unfortunately, the alternative appears to be a trick buried in Paul Ryan&#8217;s budget proposal: send certain social safety net programs down to the states, with the leading candidate being Medicaid, which is already partly funded by the states.  As much as any program, this is one that should be solely funded by the feds as that would help even the playing field across states, given that the states that need it the most are the states with the most poor people and thus least able to support their poor people.  But no, Ryan thinks that Medicaid should be sent fully to the states, and some movement in this direction has already happened.<br />      <br />This hypocritical trend of Grover Norquist &#8220;no higher taxes&#8221; politicians sending important programs to lower levels of government so they can claim &#8220;savings&#8221; without tax increases is going on more widely, also reflecting Norquist&#8217;s influence at even state levels.  So, in Virginia where I live, this most recent legislature, newly run fully by the GOP with our GOP governor, has in an effort to balance the state budget without raising taxes or appearing to cut programs, sent an unfunded mandate to the local governments, removing the funding but requiring that they contribute more to teacher pension funds.<br />    <br />This has led to a fairly astounding result, although the mayor or Harrisonburg, where I live, tells me that a lot of these legislators somehow convinced themselves it would not happen.  Nearly every local government in the state, including the vast majority of ones run by Republicans, has raised local taxes, mostly property taxes, but also others as well.  They have been cutting and cutting their budgets for the last several years, something manifesting itself nationally in the steady stream of layoffs at both state and local government levels.  The expectations by citizens for continuing to have basic local public services of some sort simply overrode this idiocy of no new taxes in the face of this unfunded mandate from the state, which in turn at least partly reflects the ongoing rise of Medicaid costs, exacerbated by the feds pushing even more of those down to the states.<br />    <br />As it is, here in Harrisonburg, property taxes are going up, along with a small increase in the rate on restaurant meals.  The alternative to the meals tax rise (much opposed by local restauranteurs) was to raise personal property taxes.  Around the state, different combinations of such increases have been implemented, and it will be interesting to see whether local voters punish their leaders for doing this or will figure it out that they have been pushed to this by the irresponsibility of state politicians.  This problem may well be worse for local Republican leaders than for Dems, given that in general the latter have not hobbled themselves so tightly with all these inane pledges about taxes, although so far, Grover Norquist has not gotten down to the local level guys with making them sign pledges and holding them publicly to them.  There are just too many of them for him to keep track of all of them. <br />Posted by Barkley Rosser at <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/06/which-spending-is-easier-to-cut-and-by.html"><abbr>12:40 AM</abbr></a></p>

<p>Punishing Irresponsible Parents and Punishing the Children of Irresponsible Parents</p>
<p>Not long ago, my wife came home a bit shocked.  My wife has a small business:  she buys houses, fixes them up, and puts renters in them.  If I may brag about my wife a moment, I note she buys well, is good at fixing houses up, and charges slightly below market prices.  The result is that she never has vacancies and that results in pretty good returns year in and year out.</p>
<p>Anyway, it seems she had been speaking to one of her tenants.  At some point in the conversation, the tenant mentioned that her sister &#8211; a single mom on various forms of social welfare &#8211; had recently had another child with the specific purpose of getting increased assistance.</p>
<p>My wife&#8217;s politics, like my own, are  best described as just slightly left of center.  (If you&#8217;ve read much of what I&#8217;ve written, you probably realized that we tend to reach our conclusions after taking a look at what the data says.)  The tenant, as I understand it, also appears to be slightly left of center.  But it was evident to the tenant that her sister was making a bad decision on many levels.  From a financial perspective alone, despite the increase in assistance (welfare, food stamps, housing, etc.), over the long haul, raising a child costs more than that.  Which is why, when some blowhard like Rush Limbaugh, says there are people out there having children they cannot afford for financial reasons, it sounds crazy.  But sometimes those blowhards are right.</p>
<p>Which raises a question.  What do we do about it?  There are plenty of single parents with no prospect of having enough income to keep themselves afloat, much less a family, having additional children while on social assistance.  There are plenty of men out there with no marketable skills whatsoever who have fathered multiple children, and then father more while on social assistance.  What is worse, the problem is to some degree self-perpetuating.  A child raised in squalor by parents who make bad, short-sighted decisions is, in many instances, not developing the skills necessary to do better when he/she reaches adulthood, including decisions about whether and when to have and raise children.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So there is a dilemma&#8230; in general, it makes no sense to incentivize or reward people who have few or no marketable skills or prospects for having children.  On the flip side, without such support, the children they do have will be raised in worse conditions than they already are.</p>
<p>If there is a real world solution to this problem? Is there a way to ensure that children who are in a bad situation through no fault of their own are well cared for and, at the same time, that nobody benefits financially, receiving rewards from the public purse for having more children than the number for which they could possibly provide good care?  And yes, I recognize that there are success stories out there &#8211; a single parent raises several children, one of whom becomes a basketball legend or a well-known entertainer jumps to mind &#8211; but how many of those are there in the scheme of things?</p>
<p>A few closing comments:</p>
<p>1.  I really don&#8217;t know how to write this post.  I&#8217;m more used to looking at statistics involving taxation and economic growth, and this was different and, frankly, uncomfortable to write.  I tried to be as straightforward and inoffensive as possible while writing it, and if I failed, please bear in mind what I was trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>2.  If you want to leave a comment, please do.  But please stick to real world suggestions.  Real world means practical, having any likelihood of having political support and being legal.  Simply declaring one&#8217;s children a bank and getting bail-outs from the Fed and the feds doesn&#8217;t qualify.</p>
