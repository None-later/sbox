<p>Variations on &#8220;Only Nixon Can Go to China&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not a short post. Be forewarned. </p>
<p>A few years ago, I co-authored a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Facts-Presidents-Measure-Issues/dp/B005HKSK8M/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1337806400&#038;sr=1-1">Presimetrics</a> with Michael E. Kanell, a reporter for the Atlanta Journal Constitution. In the book, we tried to take an objective look at how Presidents performed on a wide range of issues &#8211; everything from abortion to the national debt. To achieve that objectivity, we did two things. The first was to always get data from the most objective source we could find. Thus, when looking at the murder rate, we obtained our data from the FBI. The second thing we did to try to maintain objectivity was to treat each series exactly the same way &#8211; looking at how the series changed from right before a President took office to right before he left office. </p>
<p>We got almost no press and the book didn&#8217;t do well &#8211; perhaps in part because we tried so hard to keep our opinions and biases in check. Additionally, the book had plenty in it to anger everyone, regardless of their political persuasion. (Yes, more often than not, the facts have a liberal bias&#8230; but on a few issues near and dear to liberal hearts, they don&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>Still, I learned a lot from working on the book. And while Presimetrics is about facts, I want to talk about something subjective. As the old saw goes, only Nixon can go to China. But there&#8217;s a corollary &#8211; once Nixon goes to China, everyone else can.</p>
<p>And there have been plenty of visits to China in the past few decades. Depending on your political views, you might like some and not others but whatever you might think of them, each of them has created a precedent.</p>
<p>Once the country got used to top marginal rates in the 90 percent range, only an economically liberal President could cut tax rates, particularly since the previous time the country had undergone significant tax cuts (from 75% in 1920 down to 24% in 1929) we had the mother of economic disasters. But once LBJ did cut the top tax rate from 90% to 70%, the door was opened and it took only a few decades for us to reach a point where top rates of 39% are described as socialism.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The next Democrat in the Oval Office, Jimmy Carter, set other precedents that affect us today &#8211; perhaps the biggest of which was deregulation. Nixon himself visited at least one other China &#8211; there may have been politics behind it, but he created the EPA and made the environment a legitimate issue. The air is cleaner, and rivers aren&#8217;t on fire in Ohio any more as a result of that particular visit to China. </p>
<p>Sometimes going to China only applies to one party. The Republican Party used to be somewhat pacifist, or at least non-interventionist. The leading candidates for the Republican nomination for President in January1940 &#8211; Taft, Vandenberg &#038; Dewey &#8211; were all isolationists. Wilkie, the eventual nominee, was all over the map, but a big part of his campaign was accusing FDR of having a secret plan to get the US into WW2. </p>
<p>The first post-WW2 Republican President, Ike, sent advisers to Vietnam but little more. His military policy seemed to be maintaining the &#8220;status quo&#8221; to the point where he slapped down the British, French, and Israelis over the Suez. Ike also famously warned America of the threat posed by the military-industrial complex. The next Republican President, Nixon, pulled out of the Vietnam War. It wasn&#8217;t until Reagan invaded Grenada that it became kosher for Republicans to militarily intervene in other countries, but since then, Republican Presidents have given us Panama, Gulf War 1, Afghanistan, and Iraq. If the last two had been successful, you could bet American troops would be sitting in military bases in Iran today. <br />Here&#8217;s another single Party visit to China&#8230; after WW2, every single President until Gerald Ford presided over a decrease in the national debt as a share of GDP.</p>
<p>That changed with Ford&#8230; and every single Republican President beginning with Ford increased the national debt as a percentage of GDP. Each and every single one: Ford, Reagan, Bush 1 and Bush 2. A look at Romney&#8217;s economic plan makes it obvious he would fit right in. (If you have any doubts on that point, note that he&#8217;s already signed up both Greg Mankiw and Glenn Hubbard as &#8220;economic advisers&#8221; and then go back and check on their record.)</p>
<p>For a few reasons, increasing the debt wasn&#8217;t a precedent for Democrats &#8211; and both Carter and Clinton paid down debt, but now, with Obama laying a new course (it&#8217;s one thing to increase the debt, it&#8217;s a whole other story when that debt is expanded mostly by bailing out industries that have behaved irresponsibly), perhaps we can expect both parties to act like drunken sailors going forward. </p>
<p>Obama has been visiting other Chinas too. Despite LBJ&#8217;s tax cuts, in recent decades Democrats have concluded that tax cuts might not be good for the economy when tax rates are &#8220;too low.&#8221; (Not an unreasonable assumption &#8211; the top marginal tax rates fell from 75% to 24% between 1920 and 1929, and we all know how that turned out. Most of us also remember the last time top marginal rates dipped below 30%.) Obama has made it clear that he believes that low taxes are good for the economy, and the only reason he might consider raising the top marginal rate is because &#8220;we can&#8217;t afford it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Obama has also perfected a new political technique for Democrats &#8211; the pre-emptive surrender from a position of strength. The fact that he faces an argumentative Congress is not an excuse &#8211; he was doing it even when his own party controlled both houses of Congress! Besides, Clinton had an obstreperous Congress to deal with too, and he generally triangulated his way toward whatever he wanted. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a China that Obama can go to that Bush 2 wanted to visit but couldn&#8217;t&#8230; &#8220;fixing&#8221; Social Security. Obama has already laid some of the ground work, what with the payroll tax cut as stimulus, the Social Security commission, and some other odd noises coming out of his mouth. Expect more reluctant progress &#8220;fixing&#8221; Social Security from a second Obama term than Romney would manage, despite Romney&#8217;s enthusiasm for that sort thing.</p>
<p>Which leads us to one more extension of the Nixon going to China rule&#8230; a visit to China doesn&#8217;t count if it gets immediately repudiated. The Bush 1 tax hikes were immediately repudiated by Republicans. Reagan almost did just that with the Department of Education (created by Jimmy Carter), but then he appointed the wrong flunky to oversee its destruction. </p>
<p>Obama, on the other hand, seems to have not refuted, but rather continued the new precedents set by GW Bush. Homeland Security, spying on Americans, security theater in airports, economic stimulus geared toward rescuing the worst offenders at whatever cost, refusal to hold anyone accountable for what would normally be considered criminal behavior during the financial meltdown, keeping tax rates low, etc., etc., etc., etc. Other than the low taxes, many of these policies would have been a stretch for Republicans pre-GW, but it is pretty clear that Romney wouldn&#8217;t reverse course on any of them. The Republican Party&#8217;s precedent has been established and confirmed. It won&#8217;t be changing. </p>
<p>On the other hand, in theory, Democrats can still go back to being in favor of balanced budgets, higher taxes, more spending on social issues, and accountability for white collar crime. The Democrats can still go back to favoring policies intended to benefit the little guy. (I note, as per Presimetrics, I note that intention doesn&#8217;t always make something true in reality and some of the recipes Democrats traditionally follow don&#8217;t work, just as some of the recipes Republicans traditionally follow don&#8217;t work.)<br />But these are all approaches that run counter to what Obama has been doing. If Obama&#8217;s policies aren&#8217;t repudiated quickly, they become precedent, carved in stone. From a practical perspective, the trip to China has to be untaken now, or not at all. </p>
<p>My conclusion from all of this is a very contrarian one: if you voted for Obama in 2008, you will be best-served voting against him in 2012. On the other hand, if you voted against Obama in 2008, you will be best-served voting for him 2012. And yes, I&#8217;m serious, though I don&#8217;t expect too many people to believe me. <br />&#8212;<br />This post was written in response to <a href = "./<a href=/index.html">this</a>.</p>

                                <p>Ah well&#8230;a whole generation of readers will mourn his passing. From an AP alert: </p>
<blockquote><p>Ray Bradbury, Master of Science Fiction, Dies at 91, A.P. Says</p>
<p>Ray Bradbury, a master of science fiction whose lyrical evocations of the future reflected both the optimism and the anxieties of his own postwar America, died on Tuesday in Southern California. He was 91.</p>
<p>By many estimations Mr. Bradbury was the writer most responsible for bringing modern science fiction into the literary mainstream. His name would appear near the top of any list of major science-fiction writers of the 20th century, beside those of Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clarke, Robert A. Heinlein and the Polish author Stanislaw Lem.</p>
<p>In Mr. Bradbury’s lifetime more than eight million copies of his books were sold in 36 languages. They included the short-story collections “The Martian Chronicles,” “The Illustrated Man” and “The Golden Apples of the Sun,” and the novels “Fahrenheit 451” and “Something Wicked This Way Comes.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Update:   Courtesy of reader rjs comes two notes on the power of fiction and culture:</p>
<p>Alyssa Rosenberg at <i>Think Progress</i> writes in general on fiction, and in particular the novel <i>Foundation</i> by   Isaac Asimov and its influence on Paul Krugman (who is also an economist):<br />
<blockquote>One of the things that irritates me most is people — progressives in particular, because conservatives tend to be more vigilant on this score — who dismiss culture as if it’s unimportant, or as if people aren’t influenced by it. And my favorite counterargument of the moment comes from Paul Krugman, <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2012/05/paul-krugman-geeks-guide-galaxy/all/1">who went into economics</a> because he wanted to be Hari Seldon when he grew up&#8230;&#8230; (more below the fold)</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Fiction is about defining the outer limits of possibility: you show a kid a world where economists can shape the fate of humanity, and he’ll embrace realistic possibilities for social science he might never have been attracted to in the first place. Show girls superheroines and master archers as well as princesses and maybe some activity will catch a spark. I sometimes write that a movie or television show feels surprising because I didn’t think it was something that could exist. What really ends excites me about those pieces of art is that they’re times when popular entertainment is matching what’s truly possible in the world, and occasionally exceeding it. It’s artistically and societally depressing when media rooted in imagination turns out images and societies that are vastly more crabbed than our world actually is.</p></blockquote>

<p>America is an Opportunity Society (Rep Paul Ryan WI)</p>
<p>“<i>I’m personally offended that they’re playing a high-stakes game of chicken with our national defense</i>,” fumed Weston Newton, chairman of the Beaufort County Council, after hearing Senator Graham’s dire warnings. . <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47669971/ns/politics-the_new_york_times/" target="_blank">Lawmakers look for way out as defense cuts near</a>.</p>
<p>After agreeing to automatic cuts if a resolution to the deficit could not be agreed upon in the budgeting process, some members of the Senate now what a redo. Senator Graham goes to great lengths to stir the guns and/or butter pot of fear.</p>
<blockquote><p>· <i>The law exempts war costs and allows the administration to wall off personnel levels and military pay, about a third of the Pentagon budget. That means everything else — operations and maintenance, research and development, procurement, fuel, military construction — would face immediate cuts as deep as 13 percent,&#8221;</i> Mr. Harrison said.<br />· <i>&#8220;&#8216;</i>Our <i>ability to modernize will be basically gutted,&#8217; Senator Graham told National Guard officers in Greenville. &#8216;The Marine Corps will have to choose between its giant training camps in San Diego or Parris Island, he told community leaders in Beaufort, a stone’s throw from Parris Island.&#8221;</i><br />· &#8220;<i>&#8216;The C-17 fleet at Joint Base Charleston would be &#8216;devastated,&#8217; Senator Graham warned city leaders at the Charleston Chamber of Commerce. The cuts to the soldiers and airmen at Shaw Air Force Base would leave behind a &#8216;hollow force,&#8217; he intoned in a windowless room at the Quality Inn in Sumter.'&#8221;</i> </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>During the month of May, a House majority voted to shift the automatic cuts for Defense (resulting from the failure to approve a budget) to cuts of Domestic programs. The National Defense Authorization Act passed the House 218 to 199 in Reconciliation with Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan (strictly a guns guy) sponsoring cuts in Medicaid ($50 billion), food programs for the poor ($36 billion), federal retirement funds ($80 billion), and capping malpractice lawsuits to save $49 billion. The Act also proposes to increase Defense spending $8 billion (enough to fix 40,000 $200,000 flawed mortgages</p></blockquote>

<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>While sequestered an agreement was not reached by the handpicked members of Congress who would never reach an agreement in a decade, the Budget Control Act with its default cuts now adds another $500 billion in cuts (over the next decade) on top of the agreed upon $487 billion in Defense spending cuts agreed to last Summer. In a &#8220;<i>Quelle Surprise</i>&#8221; moment, the DEMs appear to be showing some backbone and the Republicans are finding the Dems are serious about the burden of program cuts falling equally over all programs. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>We will sit and stagnate with banks and use rockets, To oversee that it&#8217;s our bottom line that gets carried to the high seas.&#8221; </i>Shikari. Norquist would be proud of these pseudo budget cutters.<br />Falling back on the rhetoric of a built-in culture of dependency, Ryan fights back on the proposed cuts in domestic programs; &#8220;<i>Here&#8217;s the problem: These efforts aren&#8217;t working. One in six Americans today are in poverty</i>, <i>let&#8217;s get back to the idea of America as an opportunity society.&#8221; </i>It is not the two recessions in a decade, the cutting of jobs or globalization at issue, or the stagnation of income, which has led to an increasing portion of the Non-Institutional Civilian Population to reside in Not In Labor Force nor is it reductions in tax revenue; it is a culture of dependency as created by domestic programs. Another &#8220;<i>Quelle Surprise</i>&#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>moment in politics! Moreover, if we cut food and healthcare we can force them to work. When did healthcare become that cheap and affordable while earning a minimum wage? Which do you do, cast the bones of the future, gamble with your health, and forgo healthcare to buy food or the alternative is to diet? Investing more money in the military, expanding our military presence, and cutting domestic programs; Rep. Paul Ryan believes will solve the economic problem much of the population faces today. </p>
<p>Maybe in the past, the US in its early product life cycle of growth had the resource and the potential to expand the military and invest in the domestic economy; but today, the resources are limited and continuing to invest so heavily in the military could result in an erosion of global economic position. In &#8220;<i>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers</i>;&#8221; Paul Kennedy examines the growth of Defense (guns),<br /><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-TyZcQk4kveg/T86__wwmNDI/AAAAAAAAA3A/lEogAUpNDlY/s1600-h/clip_image001%25255B3%25255D.gif"><img alt="clip_image001" border="0" height="59" hspace="12" src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-v03Wx7qxpno/T87AAc6vy_I/AAAAAAAAA3I/iTvmWuv1Gds/clip_image001_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" title="clip_image001" width="233"></a><a href="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-4ih_qZU4AGk/T87AA_mzqiI/AAAAAAAAA3Q/Ztta36rsniU/s1600-h/clip_image003%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="clip_image003" border="0" height="244" hspace="12" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-AEWnM2RBdno/T87ACFepajI/AAAAAAAAA3Y/v0uSnKwmj68/clip_image003_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" title="clip_image003" width="224">Rise and Fall</a></p>
<p>armaments, global commitments, etc. without an increasing and sustaining Domestic economy and Economic Investment (butter) concluding it has been a greater contributor to a nation&#8217;s demise as a world power and relegated to second or third tier status. Kennedy does so by reviewing the nations, which have been world powers since the 16th Century and compares those former world powers and circumstance in the end with the US. He analyzes the ability to engage in conflict(s) sustained or otherwise and increased military expenditures without adequate or increasing resource of energy, other natural resource, and domestic productivity. The US with a faltering economy, an unproductive large labor pool, and an emphasis on financial and Wall Street gambling may be no longer able to sustain the military and the military complex it has today. </p>
<blockquote><p>As Paul Kennedy suggests a continuation of such policy could &#8220;<i>lead to the downward spiral of slower growth, heavier taxes, deepening domestic splits over spending priorities, and weakening capacity to bear the burdens of defense</i></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><i> </i>Hmmmmm, does it sound familar?<i> </i>and adds<i>:</i></p></blockquote>
<p><i></i><br />
<blockquote><i>The task facing American statesmen over the next decades, therefore, is to recognize that broad trends are under way, and that there is a need to “manage” affairs so that the relative erosion of the United States’ position takes place slowly and smoothly, and is not accelerated by policies which bring merely short-term advantage but longer-term disadvantage.</i> <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Great-Powers/105706569463774#!/pages/" target="_blank">The-Rise-and-Fall-of-the-Great-Powers</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It may be time to rethink our present stance on military expenditures and focus on domestic investments which will revitalize the country and bring more of those people Paul Ryan targets back into the Civilian Work Force. When the automatic cuts go into play; they will not go realign military policy favoring domestic policy; but, the Paul Ryan&#8217;s of Congress would go a long way towards providing the &#8220;Opportunity Society&#8221; he is calling for by doing so. It is an opportunity much of Congress seems to be blind too in their quest to unseat Obama and follow the pledges to Norquist.</p>

                                <p>John Sides at The Monkey Cage makes what seems to be <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/06/04/independents-are-mostly-partisans-chapter-gazillion/">an incredibly important point</a>, at least for politico types. In the latest Pew report (<a href="http://www.people-press.org/files/legacy-pdf/06-04-12%20Values%20Release.pdf">PDF</a>) that everyone’s nattering about, we see a big rise in “independent” voters over the last decade (to 38%).
<p>But:</p>
<blockquote><p>only 12% of respondents did not identify with or lean toward a party</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And if you look at the leaners, they’re just as partisan as the fully-declared party supporters:</p>
<p><img title="leaners" src="http://themonkeycage.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/pewleaners.png" alt="" width="361" height="684"></p>
<p>So pretty much everyone who’s paying attention has taken sides.</p>
<p>Do with that what you will.</p>

<p>BEA just published the state real GDP data for 2011.  Since I have not done it in a while I thought it would be interesting to create the state real GDP per capita data for 2011.  There has not been much difference since the last time I did this exercise several years ago.  The last time I did  it Massachusetts<br />was 126% of the national average and Mississippi was 63% of the national average.  The long run trend of the poorest state tending to catch up with the wealthiest states has continued in force. Now, Massachusetts real per capita GDP  is only 187% of that in Mississippi vs the 200% it was several years ago..  But I can still point out that the Republican and/or right wingers continue to try to convince us that  that we would all be better off if we were more like Mississippi and less like Massachusetts.  Go figure.</p>

                                <p>In a recent <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-american-conservative-extractive-elites-and-macro-corruption.html">post</a> I spoke with astonishment and admiration of an <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/chinas-rise-americas-fall">article/post</a> by Ron Unz in the May issue of <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_American_Conservative">The American Conservative</a></em> (he’s the publisher) that laid out a realistic, fact-based, cogent, and coherent portrait of our current economic situation. (I also pointed out that he 1. couched the post in an odd and unnecessarily tangential framing, vis-a-vis China, and 2. ignored what I consider to be the most obvious causes of that situation — thirty years of “conservative” economic ascendancy and the resulting empowerment/engorgement of the financial industry).*</p>
<p>I’ve been reading <em>TAC</em> regularly since then (yes: I’m <em>way</em> behind the curve on this), and I think it’s great. These guys fully understand that the dominant Republican/Conservative rhetoric is radical, specious, contrary to reality, and ignorant, blind to, or completely dismissive of the most basic facts on the ground — the stark, simple realities of economic history.</p>
<p><a href="http://unz.org/">Here’s</a> a guy who likes historical fact.</p>
<p>They understand that today’s so-called “conservatives” are anything but conservative. I could talk economics and politics with them over drinks without wanting to shoot myself in the head in the first twelve minutes. These are Edmund Burke/Dwight David Eisenhower conservatives. <em>We could work with these people</em>.</p>
<p>Yes, I think they still skew their causal interpretations in ways that ignore what seem to me to be patent realities, but they’re not the intentionally blind and/or shameless cherry-pickers, fact-distorters, and logic-contorters that comprise the whole Republican power structure — all the way from the base to Boehner (and decidedly including a large cohort of top-credentialed academic economists).</p>
<p>Speaking of Boehner, here’s a great example by <a href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/author/scott-galupo/">Scott Galupo</a> – a <em>TAC</em> contributor, former staffer for Boehner, and former staff writer for the Sun Myung Moon-founded (and decidedly righty) <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Times">Washington Times</a>.</em><br /><em><br /></em><br /><a href="http://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/scott-galupo/2011/11/01/ronald-reagan-practiced-keynesian-economics-successfully">Ronald Reagan Practiced Keynesian Economics Successfully – (usnews.com)</a>.</p>
<p>I’m not completely taken with this piece. He pretty much skirts the fact that Bush I and Clinton policies embodied exactly the responsible Keynesianism that he recommends (as do I) and that Reagan practiced (to some debatably greater or lesser degree) — pull back on stimulus, raise taxes as needed, and trim deficits in the good times, putting money in the bank for the bad times. And he definitely doesn’t mention how well those Bush I and (especially) Clinton policies seem to have worked out for economic growth. But still: he’s nowhere near the asylum that is modern mainstream “conservatism.”</p>
<p>So here’s a loud shoutout to <em>The American Conservative, </em>and to others of similar stripe (all of whom have been excommunicated or ignored by the Palin paleos and their nutjob nabobs). <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Frum">David Frum</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bartlett">Bruce Bartlett.</a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Buckley_(novelist)">Christopher Buckley</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reihan_Salam" title="Reihan Salam">Reihan Salam</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Manzi_(political_commentator)">Jim Manzi</a>. (My gentle readers can undoubtedly list more.) Give them your links, your &#8220;likes,&#8221; and your Google love. (Damn, I might even subscribe.) Talk to them. If we ever manage to emerge from the political and economic morass delivered unto us by the modern Republican party, these people and others like them are likely to be leading the way — in our direction.</p>
<p>* I was somewhat put out that Ron linked to my post in a <a href="http://www.ronunz.org/2012/05/07/when-half-a-million-americans-died-and-nobody-noticed/">followup</a> as if my comments were unequivocably approbative, ignoring what I think were important criticisms. But hey.</p>

                                <p>Following up on some work I did a while back (<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/capital-in-the-american-economy-since-1930-kuznets-revisited.html">Kuznets Revisited: Investment in the American Economy Since 1929</a>), I got curious about what consumption has looked like in America over the last 80 years.</p>
<p>I’ll give you the results first, as a proportion of output, or GDP, followed by explanation and discussion. Click for larger.<br /><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/US-consumption-to-output.png"><img alt="" height="328" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/US-consumption-to-output-480x328.png" title="US consumption to output" width="480"></a></p>
<p><strong>Thinking About Consumption</strong><br /><strong></strong>This all requires some explanation. First off, when I use the word “real” herein, it doesn’t mean “inflation-adjusted.” It means real-world, nonfinancial. In national-account-speak, all consumption and investment spending is about purchases of real goods and services — things that are produced and consumed. Financial “goods” or “assets” — which aren’t/can’t be consumed by humans — aren’t even part of the accounting. (We’re “inside” the NIPAs.)</p>
<p>Next: when you hear economists talk about “consumption,” they’re almost always talking about something somewhat different: consumption <em>spending. </em>Definition: purchases, within a period, of goods and services that are consumed within that same period. (If the period you’re looking at is long enough, everything is consumption. If it’s short enough, everything’s investment — breakfast is an investment in the afternoon’s work. I’ll just talk about one-year periods here to keep things simple.)</p>
<p>But in any period, we’re also consuming stuff that was produced in the past, and so is not included in measures of consumption spending. We’re depleting inventories (these fluctuate up and down over the years, sort of a buffer stock), but more importantly we’re consuming real, long-term productive assets by using them, and through the inevitable decay of time (and obsolescence — a tricky technical accounting issue that I won’t explore here). When you run a drill press you’re using it up. You’re <em>consuming</em> it. It’s even true of living in your house. Absent maintenance and remodels, it eventually becomes a worthless heap of rotting lumber; you’ve consumed its value by living in it.</p>
<p>This is accounted for in the national accounts as Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC).* (Fixed capital is broken down into equipment, software, and structures, and structures are further broken down into residential and non-residential. Consumer durables — cars and refrigerators — aren’t included in fixed capital because it would require national accountants to model households as production centers).</p>
<p>But even with that big C-word at the beginning of its name, economists rarely include CFC as part of “consumption.” In the national accounts you’ll find it accounted for as part of investment — Gross Investment minus CFC is Net Investment, or the net amount added to our national horde of fixed assets. (When you hear macroeconomists talk about investment, it’s almost always shorthand for “gross investment.”)</p>
<p>So: Consumption of Fixed Capital is <em>not</em> spending<em>, </em>but it <em>is </em>(actual, if estimated) consumption<em>.</em><br />I was wondering how much of our real output we actually consume each year, so I added CFC to consumption spending to get what I’ll call Gross Consumption (with <em>Net</em> Investment being the remainder of national spending).**</p>
<p>Coming back to the graph, we see:</p>
<p>• A denominator-driven spike in these measures during the depression (GDP plummeted).</p>
<p>• A rapid decline in the pre-war and war years driven by 1. rising GDP and 2. a massive temporary increase in government consumption spending. (Factoid: In just seven years 1940-1947, government’s share of national consumption spending went from 13% to 39% and back to 16%.)</p>
<p>• A steady period of relatively low consumption from the late 40s until the mid 70s or early 80s (depending which measure you look at).</p>
<p>• Consuming an increasingly large portion of our national output since the late 70s/early 80s — with Gross Consumption just shy of 100% ’08-’10.</p>
<p>(The timing of the 70s/80s breakpoint is somewhat unclear because of the high and variable inflation of that period, which had a significant impact on estimates of capital consumption. Changed amortization and depreciation schedules, applied against the whole existing stock of fixed assets, results in significant moves.)</p>
<p>The depression and war years are pretty to easy to understand. What’s interesting here is the trend change since the 70s/80s. That change is not generally driven by more rapid capital consumption: that’s been pretty steady over the decades (though business capital consumption has accelerated as the capital proportions have shifted from longer-lived structures to more rapidly depreciating hardware and software):<br /><img alt="" height="328" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/image001-480x328.jpg" title="investment" width="480"></p>
<p>You can see that in the first graph as well; the two lines have moved pretty much in synch.</p>
<p>So the long-term trend change for the nation as a whole is simply toward more consumption spending and less investment spending. That may seem obvious to some, but it’s nice to know it for sure.</p>
<p>It’s the same 70s/80s inflection point and secular shift that we see in so many other measures, especially various measures of economic growth (pointed out repeatedly by so many, notably on Angry Bear by Mike Kimel, <em>moi</em>, Jazzbumpa, and others, and serving as the impelling premise of Tyler Cowen’s <em>The Great Stagnation</em>).</p>
<p>I can think of a dozen different explanations, interpretations, and rhetorical riffs off of this three-decade trend. While most have a perjorative and pessimistic import, not all do. Perhaps we’ve gotten better at supply-chain management, so we require an ever-smaller buffer stock of real stuff relative to consumption and output. Or maybe we don’t need as much productive stuff — as it’s measured in dollar terms in the national accounts — to produce the same dollar-denominated quantities for consumption.</p>
<p>These strike me as pretty charitable and speculative explanations, though. The most obvious interpretation is suggested by the title of this post: we’re consuming more and more of our seed corn (and tractors), leaving less for future consumption and production (and growth). That may be true, or it may be simplistically reductive.</p>
<p>For the moment I’ll leave that determination to my gentle readers, and simply leave you with a long-term view of what seems to be an important and not-widely-discussed measure — Gross Consumption — describing how our economy has been operating over the last eighty years.</p>
<p>* I really wish they said “fixed assets” instead of “fixed capital,” because economists are so profoundly confused about what “capital” means. (Many seem to think that fixed “capital” and financial “capital” are equally parts of some synonymous, homogenous, or vaguely contiguous undifferentiated blob.) Many everyday folks are equally confused about “assets,” but most economists seem to understand at least dimly that real (or at least fixed) assets and financial assets are decidedly different things that can’t be thought about, analyzed, or modeled in the same ways. The key in discussion is to <em>always</em> specify what type of assets or capital you’re talking about, especially differentiating between financial and real (with fixed being a subset of real that happens to be fairly easily measurable by totting up money transactions).</p>
<p>** Here ignoring the trade balance for the moment; we purchase 3 or 4% more than we produce these days — part consumption spending, part investment spending — because <em>in toto </em>we import more than we export. Don’t be confused by the GDP = Production = Expenditures = Consumption Spending + Investment Spending = Income identity; that’s only true in a closed economy.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the comments on my recent <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/home-work-gdp-and-family-values-its-nice-to-be-validated.html">Home Work, GDP, and Family Values</a>, which discusses a recent <a href="http://www.bea.gov/scb/pdf/2012/05%20May/0512_household.pdf">study</a> (PDF) on the subject, Saturos <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/home-work-gdp-and-family-values-its-nice-to-be-validated.html#comment-4878">points</a> to <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/06/two_improper_co.html">this Arnold Kling post</a> replying to a <a href="http://conversableeconomist.blogspot.com/2012/05/household-production-levels-and-trends.html">Timothy Taylor post</a> summarizing that study.</p>
<p>Saturos thinks Arnold’s post is “excellent.” I think otherwise.</p>
<p>Arnold says “the value of household production” is an “improper concept to measure.” His reasoning:<br />
<blockquote>Should you measure the value of the deck by multiplying the number of hours I spend on it times the wage rate of a professional carpenter? If the carpenter takes 40 hours and I take 4000 hours, then you want to tell me that my deck is 100 times more valuable?</p></blockquote>
<p>So it’s “improper to measure” this concept because Timothy suggests the wrong wage rate to be used in the measurement/estimate. (Be Very Clear Here: <em>all</em> of the national accounts values are estimates, some more firmly grounded than others.)</p>
<p>I agree that the value of home production shouldn’t be estimated based on what a professional would charge for the same work; that makes no sense. The median wage — what I suggested in my post — does, especially since we’re talking in terms of aggregate national amounts. This completely ameliorates the problem that Arnold’s objection is based upon (basically, normalizing for “utility” and market value) — perhaps not perfectly but very effectively, estimating based on dollar-denominated, market-determined values.</p>
<p>But Arnold seems to want to do much more than correct the estimate. He wants to make off-limits any estimates of productive work not involving monetary exchange. It’s “improper” to even <em>measure </em>the concepts. They’re not just hard to estimate; they’re <em>wrong</em> to estimate.</p>
<p>Discussions of proper methods and targets for national accounting go way back. You’ll find them in spades in Kuznets (basically the father of modern national accounting) as far back as <a href="http://www.nber.org/books/kuzn46-2">1946</a>. For an excellent overview of the history and issues, see Jorgensen and Landefeld’s 2004 <a href="http://www.nber.org/CRIW/CRIWs04/jorgenson.pdf">Blueprint for an Expanded and Integrated Set of Accounts for the United States</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Three snippets from that fine work:</p>
<blockquote><p>Simon Kuznets, one of the primary architects of the U.S. accounts, recognized the limitations of focusing on market activities and excluding household production and a broad range of other non-market activities and assets that have productive value or yield satisfaction. The need to better understand the sources of economic growth in the post-war era led to the development—much of it by academic researchers—of various supplemental series, such as investments in human capital.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Kuznets (1946), favored development of a much broader set of welfare-orientated accounts that would focus on sustainability and address the externalities and social costs associated with economic development.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Work by Nordhaus and Tobin (1973), among others, on adjusting traditional economic accounts for changes in leisure time, disamenities of urbanization, exhaustion of natural resources, population growth, and other aspects of welfare produced indicators of economic well-being.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s hard to avoid imputing normative objectives to Arnold’s objection. If you outlaw measurement of things that are not represented by money transactions, you essentially outlaw discussion of utility (or, the equivalent: pre-assume that one dollar always and everywhere equals one “util”). This avoids the need to perceive some obvious implications of Textbook Economic Concepts like declining marginal utility, which tells us that transferring money from the rich to the poor, <em>ceteris paribus</em>, creates utility out of thin air.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t even dream of saying that Arnold makes these kinds of assertions to please his masters at Mercatus. (No names, just initials: Koch.) But I have no qualms saying that if he didn’t make these kinds of assertions, he wouldn’t have ended up there. <em>See</em> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manufacturing_Consent:_The_Political_Economy_of_the_Mass_Media">Manufacturing Consent</a>.</p>

<p>New Report Highlights Flaws of North Carolina Mega-Incentives </p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">new report</a> for the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center, <i>Special Deals, Special Problems&#8211;An Analysis of North Carolina&#8217;s Legislature-Approved Economic Development Incentives</i>, has just been published. It covers a range of issues I&#8217;ve emphasized here before as well as some basic considerations reporters really need to pay more attention to.    </p>
<p>North Carolina has some of the best economic development practices in the country, in terms of <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">online transparency</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">performance requirements</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">use of clawbacks</a> for non-performance by companies, sunset clauses for tax expenditures, hard caps for many tax credit programs (see my report on these points), etc. The state publishes an <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">economic development inventory</a> I consider to be of very high quality and consistent with international definitions of a subsidy. The most recent edition shows that in the 2008-9 fiscal year the state spent about $1.2 billion on economic development, enough to hire 24,000 people at $50,000 a year in wages and benefits.    </p>
<p>At the same time, however, the state has persistently had problems in overvaluing potential investments and consequently offering wildly excessive subsidies for them. The best known case is <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">Dell in 2004</a>, when Virginia offered the company a $37 million incentive package, while the state and local bid from North Carolina came to almost $300 million on a nominal basis ($174 million present value). Other deals discussed in the report are Google ($260 million nominal value, $140 million present value), Apple ($321 million over 30 years nominal value, no present value calculation available), and a provision in a 2011 special incentives bill to allow Alex Lee Inc. to keep $2 million it should have forfeited for not keeping job promises. This last case illustrates how special legislative deals weaken the state&#8217;s performance requirements; this case will make future companies think that there may be no penalty for non-performance.    </p>
<p>Reporters take note! This publication describes useful techniques for comparing the size of incentive packages regardless of project size or payout period of the incentive. From the European Union I borrow the term &#8220;aid intensity,&#8221; which measures the size of the incentive relative to the amount of the investment or the number of jobs created. The idea is that a $1 million incentive would be large for a call center but a rounding error for an automobile assembly plant. As a result, we need a standardized way of comparing incentives.    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>While in this country one can sometimes find cost per job analyzed for some subsidy packages, the EU actually uses the subsidy/investment metric as its primary measure of aid intensity. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">In my last post</a> I discussed a mall redevelopment which could conceivably have an aid intensity of 96%. For comparison purposes, we should note that the highest aid intensity allowed for large firms anywhere in the European Union, is 50%, and that is only allowed in the poorest regions of the EU, mainly in eastern Europe. (Richer regions have lower allowable maxima.) A region&#8217;s maximum is cut by half for large projects over 50 million euro, and by 66% for spending over 100 million euro.    </p>
<p>The other important concept is present value, a familiar one to accountants and economists, but not widely understood among the general public. The basic idea is simple: receiving a dollar today is worth more than receiving a dollar next year, which is worth more than receiving a dollar in two years, etc. Since incentive packages can pay out immediately (with a cash grant) or over a period of 30 or more years, we need to use present value to properly compare the size of incentives with different payout periods. This requires finding a a &#8220;discount rate&#8221; by which to reduce future payments. We then use the present value as the numerator in calculating aid intensity to be able to compare across different sizes of projects.    </p>
<p>Using Google as an example, this $600 million project will receive $260 million over 30 years and create 210 jobs. As mentioned above, this is its nominal cost, before discounting the future dollars. Following the practice of a 1990s study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to compare subsidies among its then 23 members, I used a discount rate equal to the 10-year Treasury bond yield to come up with a present value of $140.6 million. Then the aid intensity is $140.6 million/$600 million, or 23%, and the cost per job at present value is $669,489.</p>
<p>We can then use these two measures of aid intensity to compare the incentive to that given for other projects and inform our judgment of whether it was a better or worse deal than other states have made, in the current context where states make such deals all the time. Of course, I believe there should be limits placed on state and local governments so we can sharply reduce net incentive spending, which has few national benefits&#8211;but that is a long time in the future.    </p>
<p>North Carolina provides an intriguing case study because it does so much right in economic development, but it makes special deals outside its statutory incentive programs. The result is high costs and weakened bargaining position in the future. It&#8217;s a case we can learn a lot from. </p>

<p>Heading into the Tuesday vote Mayor Barrett with ~$4million in election funds of which 26% is drawn from out of state sources faces off with the under siege Governor Walker having ~$30 million in funds with 2/3rds coming from out of state sources. Again the Koch Bros are kicking in with a sizeable contribution of $1 million as well as the multi-billionaire owner of the Sands, Sheldon Adelson, with another sizeable sum ($1 million?). The unions and citizens of Wisconsin are hard pressed to support Barrett in a similar fashion. So much for payroll wages versus corporate profits. Tuesday election may be a bellwether for the Democrats and the November elections as the 99-percenters and labor take on corporate interests and the &#8220;1-percenters&#8217; who are both investing heavily in Walker intending to sway the state into the Red column.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tuesday’s recall election of Republican Gov. Scott Walker is the most expensive in Wisconsin history. More than $63.5 million has been spent by candidates and independent groups, the overwhelming majority underwritten by out-of-state sources.</p>
<p>The record spending total was made possible thanks to the <em>Citizens United</em><i> U.S. Supreme Court decision — which had the effect of invalidating Wisconsin’s century-old ban on independent expenditures by corporations and unions — and a state law that allows unlimited contributions to the incumbent in recall elections.&#8221; <a href="http://www.iwatchnews.org/2012/06/03/9039/wisconsin-recall-breaks-record-thanks-outside-cash" target="_blank">Election a national referendum on public sector unions</a></i></p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Having amassed a sizeable war chest directly resulting from United Citizen&#8217;s opening the donation flood gates for corporate interests and a state law allowing recalled Governor Walker unlimited contributions, Walker has a slight lead and is favored to win. While this may end the recall efforts by angered unions and others, Walker&#8217;s troubles may not be over as he faces indictment over fundraising efforts by aides and his choice for Lieutenant Governor Brett Davis. There is quite a bit of speculation how this will all play out and it is not the first time the former Milwaukee County Executive has found himself in trouble for questionable activities.</p>
