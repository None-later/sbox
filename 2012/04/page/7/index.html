                                <p>I see that his blog Mankiw shows a chart of the employment population ratio to make a comment about the &#8220;so called recovery&#8221;.</p>
<p>But he selected the start date of the chart so that you could not see that during the eight years of the Bush administration the employment-population fell from 63.0 to 60.3, a 2.7 drop.</p>
<p>Since Obama took office the employment-population  fell from 60.3 to 58.6, a 1.7 drop.</p>
<p>The ratio has done poorly under both administrations, but people who live in glass houses should be careful about throwing rocks.</p>

                                <p><strong></strong><br /><strong></strong>by <strong>Michael Halasy</strong></p>
<p><strong>Drug shortages and the mythical market</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br />I read an interesting article by Gehrett in the January issue of <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/content/307/2/153.full" target="_blank">JAMA</a>.</p>
<p>In response to the increased utilization of generic drugs (currently about 70% of drugs used in the US), a fact which should be applauded, we have seen a frightening increase in drug shortages. In Emergency Medicine, three of them have affected me directly as they are commonly used drugs. One, metoclopramide is useful for headaches, nausea, and gastric motility. Another, etomidate, is a useful sedative that is the staple drug in RSI (Rapid Sequence Intubation) kits across the country, and used on EMS ambulances extensively. There is a reason. Etomidate has lower cardiopulmonary depression than other sedatives like diprivan aka propofol. Another drug that is in shortage is Compazine, aka prochlorperazine, which is extensively used for migraines, as well as benign vertigo. In fact, it remains one of my favorite “staple” drugs. </p>
<p>Per the article, in 2005, the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research only noted 62 shortages through the year. 2009 saw 157 shortages, 2010, 178. 2011 had estimates of between 200 and 300. 75% in 2010 were sterile injectables. Ya know, The medications most frequently used in hospital settings. Many of these drugs are made at one site, by only one company, which limits supply and increases the chances of disruption.</p>
<p>While Gehrett does note that 80% of raw materials come from foreign countries, there does not seem to be any shortage of raw materials that have been documented or noted. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The only single, commonality, is that all of the medications we have seen in shortage status are off patent, generic medications, that are harder to formulate than some others, and have a definable shelf life. <br />President Obama has signed legislation that will give the FDA more latitude in heading off shortages, but this problem plainly reports to a market problem. Demand exists…supply is stable, but profits are not high on these medications. This would suggest that companies are simply avoiding injectable generics, and focusing on more profitable patented medications. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, cancer trials have been put on hold, while companies focus on profit margins. Headache patients suffer and receive other medications that may be suboptimal for them. This situation is only worsening with time, and should be cause of concern for all Americans.</p>

<p>More on Private Equity, Carried Interest, Wealth, and Romney</p>
<p>Those who&#8217;ve read much of this blog are aware of the various arguments against the notion that private equity firms are &#8220;do-gooders&#8221; that we should encourage and even subsidize (through the carried interest provision). On the whole, I believe they are part of a harmful trend towards consolidation of enterprises that weakens links to communities, makes caring for workers seem like too great a cost, and encourages over-leveraging and instability that ultimately is devastating to the economy. Add to that the egregiously inappropriate tax treatment of &#8220;carried interest&#8221; paid to managers, and you have a wealth-building machine for a small, elite group that does not pay its fair share of the tax burden and whose activities are likely a net social detriment.</p>
<p>Specifically, private equity firms historically have looked for good, stable businesses with decent cash flows, low leverage and decent but not high profits that they can take over, leverage highly (to pay for the acquisition and to provide quick funds to fuel their own ultra-high profit demands), with the cash flow from the ongoing business paying off the debt. The result in these leveraged buyout cases may be that a stable busienss with a profit of 5-6% that spent what was needed on maintenance and new investment, expanding gradually and paying its workers a decent wage and its owners a small but decent profit becomes an overleveraged company that is less stable and has to use more of its cash flow to pay off the debt. </p>
<p>One result of excessive debt is that expenditures for maintenance and investment in new equipment are deferred. and business stalls for the time it takes to pay off the debt. Sometimes that stall is merely a bad time for the business (and often its workers). Liquidity problems can result in proclaimed &#8220;efficiency&#8221; decisions to fire or lay off hundreds of workers and to reshape benefits like pensions and health care. That&#8217;s if the company stays in operation. Sometimes the debt service and resultant deferral of investments and change of focus of the business will be fatal. Costly leverage results in bankruptcy or in the business being broken up and sold in pieces, either way with many workers losing jobs (and benefits) and many communities suffering dire consequences. Whatever happens, the equity fund managers gets high fees and &#8220;carried interest&#8221; profits taxed at inappropriately low tax rates. Romney, for instance, continued to get a &#8220;carried interest&#8221; cut from Bain Capital&#8217;s activities in compensation for past work done, long after he retired from doing any work at the firm in 1999. See <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-using-ethics-exception-to-limit-disclosure-of-bain-holdings/2012/04/05/gIQARcVmxS_story.html?wpisrc=nl_pmpolitics">Romney using ethics exception to limit disclosure of Bain holdings</a>, Washington Post (April 5, 2012).</p>
<p>And of course, private equity firms do not necessarily invest only in domestic companies. They may hold considerable assets offshore&#8211;possibly in some of those very companies that represent low-wage, low-benefits, and low-worker-rights havens for US multinationals that end US jobs here in order to hire more cheaply abroad&#8230;.. Romney, for instance, has holdings in &#8220;a high-tech sensor control firm that has moved U.S. manufacturing jobs to China.&#8221; Id. (noting that these holdings were revealed through SEC filings).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>One wonders if those realities of equity funds is a reason that Romney has used an ethics exception to limit his disclosure of Bain holdings. See <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/romney-using-ethics-exception-to-limit-disclosure-of-bain-holdings/2012/04/05/gIQARcVmxS_story.html?wpisrc=nl_pmpolitics">Romney using ethics exception to limit disclosure of Bain holdings</a>, Washington Post (April 5, 2012). <br />
<blockquote>By offering a limited description of his assets, Romney has made it difficult to know precisely where his money is invested, whether it is offshore or in controversial companies, or whether those holdings could affect his policies or present any conflicts of interest.<br />In 48 accounts from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/mitt-romney-bain-capital-and-the-gospel-of-creative-destruction/2012/01/09/gIQAfRKEsP_story.html">Bain Capital</a>, the private equity firm he founded in Boston, Romney declined on his financial disclosure forms to identify the underlying assets, including his holdings in a company that moved U.S. jobs to China and a California firm once owned by Bain that filed for bankruptcy years ago and laid off more than 1,000 workers.<br />***[M]ost of the underlying assets — the specific investments of Bain funds— are not known because Romney is covered by a confidentiality agreement with the company.<br />Several of Romney’s assets — including a large family trust valued at roughly $100 million, nine overseas holdings and 12 partnership interests— were not named initially on his disclosure forms, emerging months later when he agreed to release his tax returns.<br />***<br />Several outside experts across the political spectrum, however, say Romney’s disclosure is the most opaque they have encountered, with some suggesting the filing effectively defeats the spirit of disclosure requirements.<br />***<br />[Romney&#8217;s failure to disclose these assets, and the inapplicability of conflict-of-interest &#8220;must sell&#8221; requirements to a President, mean that we may never know and that Romney may continue to hold positions that would be inappropriate for a sitting president.] Although still subject to the disclosure requirements, a president cannot be compelled by OGE to sell undisclosed assets, according to an OGE official. Romney’s would be the first presidency to face this circumstance. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the article notes, one reason Romney doesn&#8217;t disclose Bain&#8217;s underlying assets is that Bain (a fund he created) requires its participants to enter into confidentiality agreements. Handy for a politician with considerable wealth that the institution he created &#8220;requires&#8221; him to keep its investments secret. But not so handy for the people whom a president is supposed to serve. As Democratic Party lawyer Joe Sandler noted, “Romney’s approach frustrates the very purpose of the ethics and disclosure laws.” Id. The disclosure is intended to &#8220;allow the public to identify potential conflicts of interest and the personal economic priorities of candidates and elected officials.&#8221; Id. (quoting Fred Wertheimer, an advocate who worked on getting the law passed after Watergate). The right answer to a refusal to disclose is that the candidate should divest or else not run for office. Id. (noting that various Washington lawyers provide this advice to candidates who cannot disclose underlying assets).</p>
<p>As the campaign progresses with continuing claims by GOP advocates that Romney&#8217;s &#8220;entrepreneurial&#8221; activity at Bain demonstrates that he has the business sense we purportedly need in a president, more scrutiny will fall on his current holdings as well as Bain&#8217;s past and present activities and just how well such an organization does (or does not) support the country&#8217;s economy.</p>

They are not showing the recent improvement that other employment data have been reporting  Recently, unit labor cost has been rising faster than prices, implying margin pressure and very weak profits.  To sustain profits growth, firms have to reestablish stronger productivity growth. The weakness in March employment is a strong indicator that business is trying to rebuild productivity growth and profits growth.</p>

The year over year gain is now only 1.7%, a new record low.  Moreorer, weekly earnings  growth slowed to only 2.2%.  The recent improvement in retail sales had been driven largely by a decline in consumer savings and their are  serious questions about how long this could be sustained.</p>

<p>Top 1% Reduced Taxes in Last 3 Years but Probably Gained Income Share  </p>
<p><a href="http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2012/04/who_pays_taxes_in_america.php">Citizens for Tax Justice</a> came out with a nice report today showing that the overall U.S. tax system is just barely &#8220;progressive,&#8221; which is to say that as your income goes up, so does your tax rate. While the federal income tax is progressive in this sense, many state and local taxes, such as sales and property taxes are regressive in that lower income people pay higher percentages of their income than do higher income people. The following table from CTJ makes this crystal clear:<br />    <br /><img alt="" height="400" src="http://ctj.org/images/taxday2012table.jpg" width="386"></p>
<p>As the right-hand portion of the table shows, as income rises federal taxes (individual and corporate income, estate tax, etc.) increase as a percentage of income, from 5.0% of income for the lowest 20% of earners to 21.1% for the top 1% of taxpayers. Meanwhile, state and local taxes move in exactly the opposite direction, from 12.3% of income for the lowest 20% to 7.9% for the top 1%. As CTJ further points out, for every income group the share of total taxes they pay is extremely close to their share of total income (in fact, the biggest difference is 1.7 percentage points).    </p>

<p>We already knew, thanks to <a href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~saez/saez-UStopincomes-2010.pdf">Emmanuel Saez</a>, that in 2010, the top 1% got 93% of all income gains. With the new 2011 data, we find that the top 1% has continued to make out like gangbusters. <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/08/top-1-pays-and-other-tax-myths.html">As I reported in August</a>, using data from the conservative <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html">Tax Foundation</a>, in 2008 the top 1% earned 20.00% of all income. As we see in the table above, just three years later that has grown to 21.0%. Considering that the 2011 data is estimated, perhaps this change is not too significant. But what is really striking is that the top 1% paid only 21.1% of its income in all federal taxes in 2011, whereas in 2008 it paid at a rate of 23.27% for personal income tax alone. </p>
<p>Since the top 1% gets an even more disproportionate share of corporate income and taxable estate income than it does of personal income, this is solid evidence that it&#8217;s a real reduction we are seeing. I hate to sound like a broken record, but it&#8217;s really true that there is one tax system for the 1% and another one for the rest of us.   </p>

<p><strong>Health Care Thoughts: Physicians &#8220;Rationing&#8221; Health Care</strong>   <br />Nine physician panels have recommended less testing of patients presenting with various conditions and diseases and less treatment for some diagnosis.   </p>
<p>For Details: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/health/doctor-panels-urge-fewer-routine-tests.html?_r=2&#038;ei=5065&#038;partner=MYWAY&#038;pagewanted=print">New York Times</a>    </p>
<p>Much of this is low hanging fruit, such as using less antibiotics for sinusitis. Some of this is old news, my physician altered his cardiac and prostate screening years ago    </p>
<p>Other recommendations may be more controversial. In 2009 evidenced based recommendations to do less breast cancer screening were met with a firestorm of criticism. Current recommendations to do less cancer screening may meet a similar fate.<br />    <br />There will be another controversy, whether or not these guidelines would protect a physician using conservative treatment protocols from malpractice suits. In my experience, probably not.<br />     <br />Eventually payment bundling and new payment schemes may accomplish the &#8220;rationing&#8221; via a different route.<br />    <br />Stay tuned.</p>

                                <p><i>Preramble</i>: <i> I posted this <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2011/04/brute-economics-of-slavery.html">on my blog</a> exactly a year ago today, in slightly different form.   Dan linked to it once, from here, just a few weeks before I started writing for Angry Bear.   Recent comments got me thinking about it again. </i></p>
<p><i> </i>In thinking about the economics of slavery, I&#8217;m considering slavery and  serfdom to be economic near-equivalents. Of course, I recognize that  there are qualitative differences between chattel-slavery and serfdom:</p>
<p>&#8211;  In slavery, the master owns the person of the slave; in serfdom the   master owns the labor output of the serf, either as a stated labor  quantity, a stated output quantity, or some combination. </p>
<p>&#8211;  Serfs enjoy some measure of freedom, and can accumulate personal  wealth, after the rents are paid; slaves do not and cannot.  (The point,  though is to keep rents so high that accumulation is prohibitively  unlikely.)</p>
<p>&#8211;  It might be easier to gradually and incrementally impose serfdom on  an existing population. First generation slaves need to be captured,  conquered, or in some other way removed from &#8211; and deprived of &#8211; their  native state. Thus, serfdom is imposed on the indigenous population,  slaves are more typically imported.</p>
<p>&#8211;  The individual slave is a depreciating asset.  But, as a population,  slaves are self-renewing, since, unlike Shakers, they reproduce.   Serfs  are factor inputs rather than assets.  (On the other hand, the master  also owes the serf protection, and sustenance in times of famine.  In  that sense, the serf resembles an asset that requires maintenance.)</p>
<p>These are significant differences, to be sure, but mostly from a  sociological or political perspective.  In terms of the brute economics,  they are somewhere between second order and trivial.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>The necessary conditions for reducing a population to serfdom are as follows.</p>
<p>&#8211; A large wealth and power disparity between the haves and the have-nots. </p>
<p>&#8211; Perhaps more significantly, the ownership of virtually all assets by  an elite class, with severely limited opportunities for the general  population to own or accumulate assets.</p>
<p>&#8211; A poorly educated population with limited skill sets.</p>
<p>&#8211; Severely impaired individual mobility, due to an impossible debt and/or tax  burden and legal restrictions.</p>
<p>&#8211; Government of the masters, by the masters, for the masters, with  little or no sense of worth or justice for the serfs.  This enforces and  reinforces the previous point.</p>
<p>&#8211; A social and/or religious system that recognizes the inherent<i> meritocracy</i> of the master class.</p>
<p>&#8211; A population that is scared or coerced into ceding their freedom to the masters in exchange for security.</p>
<p>&#8211; The political will to deprive people of their fundamental human dignity. </p>
<p>Via <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/03/more-on-simple-models/">Krugman</a>, we find Delong&#8217;s repost of a short <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2003_archives/001447.html">treatise on slavery and serfdom by Evrey Domar</a>.</p>
<p>Domar points out additional requirements, and a mechanism for serfdom to develop.</p>
<p>&#8211; Low population density: Labor scarcity favors slavery/serfdom,  since the cost of freeman labor will be high.  I&#8217;ll admit I didn&#8217;t get  this until is was stated the other way around.  Population growth favors  freeman labor since <i>the competition for jobs drives wages down</i>.  (Note the implicit denial of the <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2010/12/moron-lump-of-labor-fallacy-fallacy.html">&#8220;Lump of labor fallacy&#8221; canard</a>.)</p>
<p>&#8211; A large class of what Domar calls &#8220;servitors&#8221; who owe  allegiance, taxes, and military support to a higher authority.  They are  the equivalent of medieval vassals of a liege lord, who extract from  the local peasant population not only their own means of existence, but  that of their liege, as well.   This is the beginning of, and most  literal sense of &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent-seeking">rent-seeking</a>.&#8221;   The process is that, starting with a free population, by taxation or  other forms of indebtedness, the freedom of the common people is  eroded.  Those whom Domar calls &#8220;servitors&#8221; I call leaches.</p>
<p>&#8211; Explicit Government complicity in restricting mobility, via  legal structures. Besides limiting the population&#8217;s mobility in a gross  sense, it also eliminates the possibility of competition among different  servitors.</p>
<p>In this way, serfdom developed in depopulated* Western Europe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Antiquity#Cities">during or after the late Roman Empire</a>,  and in Eastern Europe many centuries later &#8211; in fact, long after  serfdom has disappeared in the West.  In each case, the critical  enabling factor was low population density, resulting in a critical  shortage of labor.</p>
<p>Basically, it comes down to an economic evaluation of costs and returns.    But these are not easy to determine with any precision in the  abstract, and probably not in the actual event, either, unless the  increment is quite large.  The slave, and even the serf, needs  maintenance in a way that the free laborer does not.  The serf can be  compelled to work past his willingness in way that the free man cannot.   On the other hand, the free man might have higher willingness and unit  productivity.  The wild card here is what the free man can demand as  wages, and that depends on the competition for available jobs.  The  bottom line is that serfdom will dominate whenever the profit (revenues  less costs) of keeping a serf is greater than that of hiring a free  laborer.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this was long ago &#8211; pre-industrial revolution in fact,  and centered on a low-technology agrarian system.  What message does it  have for us today?   <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/theory/SerfsUp.html">Here, Krugman wonders</a>**  why, after the the plagues of the mid-14th century, serfdom wasn&#8217;t  reestablished in Western Europe, since the population was greatly  depleted.  Domar has no clear answer, and Delong won&#8217;t hazard a guess. I  will &#8212; but it&#8217;s only a guess.  Perhaps society had moved on, and the  culture was no longer accepting of serfdom as a social institution.   Serfdom had faded away from lack of interest and due to population  growth many decades before the plague epidemics occurred around 1350.   There were sufficient numbers of artisans, craftsmen, guilds, merchants,  and bankers, such that tying people back to the soil might not have  been easy, or even desirable.   The growth of towns might have played a  part.  Another social factor is that in late Eastern European serfdom,  the servitor&#8217;s status was determined by the number of serfs he  controlled.  I don&#8217;t think that was ever the case in the West.   Sometimes social factors trump economics.</p>
<p>Also, as Barbara Tuchman points out in A Distant Mirror (Ch 11,  frex.), though the population decreased due to the plague, total wealth  in coins and material possessions did not, and they were largely in the  hands of the elite.  It could be that with this wealth maintained, the  brute economic drive for serfdom was absent, or severely attenuated,  despite the labor shortage.</p>
<p>Krugman also wonders: &#8220;<i>And  an even bigger question: why hasn&#8217;t indentured servitude made a  comeback in the modern era? Yes, I know, human rights and all that &#8211; but  if it was profitable to have indentured servants in the modern world,  I&#8217;m sure that Richard Scaife&#8217;s think tanks would have no trouble finding  justifications, and assorted Christian groups would explain why it&#8217;s  God&#8217;s will.</i>&#8221;  </p>
<p>Well, that was in 2003, when Scaife was well known and the Koch brothers  weren&#8217;t.  This statement also gets a lot of ridicule in comments at  Delong&#8217;s Domar post.  But, there were certainly many Christian  apologists for slavery, and you can see today that tea-baggers and the  Christian Right do not exactly align themselves on the side of human  rights vs the brute force of the elite.</p>
<p>So Krugman&#8217;s question remains, hanging over us like the sword of  Damocles.  Here is the way I see it. First off, you need to be skeptical  about translating a socio-economic phenomenon from a different place  and time to the here-and-now.  Our population is not sparse nor badly  educated (yet), and we do not have a pre-industrial agrarian economy.   But these differences effect the possibilities and modes of  implementation.  They don&#8217;t effect the ongoing defects of human nature  that Krugman obliquely alludes to.  These are greed, ego, and the lust  for power, and you can see them manifesting themselves right here in the  U.S. today in the struggle between labor and the minions of the wealthy  elite.</p>
<p>When I think about serfdom, I also think about more modern  analogs &#8211; sharecroppers, coal miners who owed their soul to the company  sto&#8217;e, child laborers in early industrialized England, indentured  servants, the exploitation of illegal immigrants, and the union busting  practices that have been highly successful here since 1980.</p>
<p>In evaluating the conditions that favor and disfavor serfdom as such,  something is missing from the analysis.  That is that somewhere along  whatever spectrum of conditions makes serfdom more or less economically  favorable to the elite, there is a point (or region) of indifference.   If working people are reduced to the point where the economics are no  less favorable to the elite than serfdom, then actually going through  the formality of making them serfs simply isn&#8217;t worth the effort, and  doesn&#8217;t make any economic difference.</p>
<p>What do we have today?</p>
<p>&#8211; The largest wealth disparity since before the great depression &#8211; at every stratum of society, growing larger every day.</p>
<p>&#8211; An all out assault by the moneyed elite on the wealth and status of working people.   Union busting is one of the tools.</p>
<p>&#8211; Deliberate undermining of public education.</p>
<p>&#8211; Segments of the population tied to the land by under-water mortgages or the inability to unload a property.</p>
<p>&#8211; Popular social movements with religious backing that favor the interests of the elite over the interests of the people.</p>
<p>&#8211; Constant fear-mongering as a pretext for inducing people to give up their basic rights.</p>
<p>&#8211; A moneyed elite that effectively owns government.</p>
<p>Krugman&#8217;s apparent underlying assumption, which I share, is that &#8211; for  the servitors at least, and possibly  for the serfs as well &#8211; serfdom is  a strategy of least resistance, and  therefore the default social  order, <i>whenever the conditions for it are right</i>.</p>
<p>One of the things that can make conditions not right for serfdom is  regulated entrepreneurial capitalism &#8211; inventiveness, innovation,  industry, and real competition.  Capitalism generates wealth, increases  wages, opportunities and the standard of living, and reinforces concepts  of freedom, liberty, and fair practices.  Effective regulation assures  that fair practices are maintained, keeps the playing field even, and  increases the likelihood that reward is in some way proportional to a  combination of skill and effort.  Capitalism is expansionist by nature,  serfdom is static.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, over time, capitalism transmogrified into Corporatism.</p>
<p>Corporatism, for all its acquisitiveness,  is a very different  phenomenon.  Ownership is remote.  Assets are used in large part for  executive bonuses, dividends, and mergers and acquisitions.  Though the  track record of M&#038;A in meeting stated goals is dismal, the real net  effect is monopolization &#8211; corporatists hate competition.  Corporatism  seeks always and everywhere to decrease wages, and is utterly  indifferent to the living standards, freedom, and opportunities of  anyone outside the elite.  Ethics and fairness are non-existent.   Rewards are in proportion to rapacity.  In other words, Corporatism is  the new feudalism.</p>
<p>This is why I say that the goal of the Republican party, as servitors to  Scaife, the Koch&#8217;s and their ilk, is to take us back to the 12th  century &#8211; or whatever it&#8217;s 21st Century near-equivalent might be.  I&#8217;ve stated that trans-national corporations with no loyalty  to anyone or anything constitute the real road to serfdom, in  contradistinction to <a href="http://snarkypenguin.blogspot.com/2011/03/thought-for-day.html">what Hayek said</a>.    That is a bit inaccurate, though. Once wage scales are reduced to the  par value of slave maintenance, it doesn&#8217;t matter what the correct  technical description of our condition is, and the elite won&#8217;t care.</p>

                                <p>This post is not very economic oriented except indirectly, but I felt a need to mark the extraordinary temperatures of high and some low 100 year records.  Lifted and edited for readability in blog format from an e-mail newsletter sent by reader <strong>rjs</strong> come examples and links for both record setting high temperatures and consecutive days of high temperatures this March.</p>
<p>I watched in March my daylilies at 6&#8243; plus preceding peones, real azaleas flowering the same time as mongolian azaleas,  and trees <em>flowering</em> a month early simultaneous to blue squill.     <strong>rjs</strong> provides  links.  Dr. Masters website would not allow links to specific posts for me, so go to March archives for material.</p>

<blockquote>&#8230;Meteorologist <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/show.html">Dr Jeff Masters of the popular wunderblog</a>, writing from Michigan, probably expressed it best; &#8220;this March started with 12 days of April weather, followed by 10 days of June and July weather, with 9 days of May weather predicted to round out the month&#8221;. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>   One example is <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;frm=1&#038;source=web&#038;cd=2&#038;ved=0CCwQFjAB&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emptywheel.net%2F2012%2F03%2F20%2Fwhy-does-fat-al-gore-hate-flower-festivals%2F&#038;ei=UmxuT6OnPIfwggeb1Y1s&#038;usg=AFQjCNFhAYfAX7fzHNF2lQ_yROv6iFk4Bw">Holland, Michigan was planning a tulip festival for May, but saw their blooms last week</a>. Of course, it wasnt just Michigan as <a href="http://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/show.html">temperatures in the 80s were reached in every border state from North Dakota to Maine</a>, as well as <a href="http://climatechangepsychology.blogspot.com/2012/03/jeff-masters-summer-in-march-2012-heat.html">from Manitoba to Nova Scotia in Canada</a>.  <a href="http://climatechangepsychology.blogspot.com/2012/03/march-16-2012-1587-record-breaking-high.html">2023 record-breaking high temperatures were set in the US, while a low was breached only 58 times</a>&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>there are a handful of links immediately below which will lead you to all the details, but the highlights include 4 locations (one ea in NH, MI &#038; 2 in MN) where the overnight low in a location eclipsed the previous daytime record high (in locations with 100 years of records), and several locations where the previous record high temperature for the date was exceeded by more than 30°F.  Several locations in the US and Canada also experienced record high temperatures for April,  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;frm=1&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CCUQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fi.wund.com%2Fauto%2Fiphone%2Fblog%2FJeffMasters%2Fshow.html&#038;ei=UmxuT6OnPIfwggeb1Y1s&#038;usg=AFQjCNH6Qo9Lgssj0VnrFISSDm-ksQDN4g">ten record high days in a row at International Falls, MN, the most consecutive records ever set anywhere</a>, (and many cities where a new record was set 9 days in a row, including chicago, when observing 7 consecutive record temps at a location is a once in a meteorological blue moon experience… )  </p>
<p>While most everyone experiencing this heat wave probably perferred it to the normal frigid and windy march in this part of the country, there are a few caveats; first, fruit crops are at least a month ahead of schedule over most of the area noted, and damaging frosts are still likely into May.    </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Secondly, a lot of the western areas that would normally have a snow cover are already starting to dry out, raising the potential for drought during the planting season,    </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Lastly, anecdotal reports from the region indicated that with the entire winter being mild, the ground did not freeze deeply, so the normal winter kill of damaging insects didnt occur; so we can expect a bad year for plant pests and ticks, &#038; the mosquitoes are already flying&#8230;</p></blockquote>
