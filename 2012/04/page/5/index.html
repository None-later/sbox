                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Today&#8217;s FT (front page, below the fold*) declares that <a href="http://www.bis.org/author/mark_carney.htm">Mark Carney</a> &#8220;has been informally approached as a candidate&#8221; to head the Bank of England &#8220;in June next year.&#8221;  He is currently governor of the Bank of Canada.</p>
<p>It would be a good choice.  As the speeches at the link above note, Carney is no fool, which often seems rather more than one can say for many members of David Cameron&#8217;s Administration.**</p>
<p>Of course, the BoE already has one foreigner who should be considered as Merwyn King&#8217;s successor—but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Posen">Adam Posen is American</a>.  As the FT anonymously notes:<br />
<blockquote>Naming a foreigner as Governor&#8230;would break with tradition, although Mr. Carney has a British wife, studied at Oxford university [sic] and worked at [The Giant Vampire Squid] in London early in his career.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a Canadian national, he is a subject of the Queen,&#8221; said one supporter. &#8220;That is important.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m now waiting for <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon">Felix Salmon</a> to start a &#8220;Posen for the BoE Governorship&#8221; campaign which, sadly, is likely to be about as successful as his &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/04/03/does-anybody-at-all-think-kims-a-better-candidate-than-ngozi/">Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala for the World Bank Presidency</a>&#8221; campaign.</p>
<p>*no link&#8211;being a print subscriber, online access is limited to PDFs, and the website is quite unfriendly to non-online subscribers</p>
<p>**Cameron&#8217;s choices remind one that however pathetic Tim Geithner is, it is possible to do worse.  I mean, really, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/01/britain-in-the-1930s-and-britain-today.html">George Effing Osborne</a>? A man who supposedly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne">prepared for five years in the &#8220;Shadow&#8221; role</a> and came up with <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa2/quarterly-national-accounts/q4-2011/stb---quarterly-national-accounts-gdp-q4-2011.html#tab-GDP-analysed-by-expenditure-categories--chained-volume-measures--Table-C2">this shite</a>?</p>

<p>Buffett Rule rejected by Senate</p>
<p>The Senate rejected the effort to make tax policy commensurate with the slogans about American values that we parrot freely&#8211;opportunity, paying fair shares, etc. Given the now rigid &#8220;phantom&#8221; filibuster rule requiring a supermajority to pass anything in the Senate, the Republicans &#8211;especially if joined by a few of the right-leaning Democrats&#8211;can defeat just about any attempt at reasonable taxation.</p>
<p>So Senate 2230 got only a majority of the SEnate (51 votes) in support of the effort to move the Buffett Rule&#8211;calling for a phased in increase to 30% minimum tax on taxpayers with income in excess of a million a year. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Minority Whip Jon Kyl (radical rightist Republican from Arizona) said Congress should instead be focussing on the economy. BNA Daily Tax RealTime (Apr. 16, 2012 at 7:35pm). Shows how completely out of tune with reality the Republican right is. Focusing on the divide between rich and poor is the best way to focus on the economy these days. We are so busy redistributing upwards through tax and fiscal policies that we are rapidly driving the middle class into extinction and depriving those who are disadvantaged by income and other demographics (like location in inner cities) of a fair opportunity to live a decent life. Watch Angela Grovers Blackwell on Bill Moyers PBS program (4/15/12) for more on what equity really means and how our policies are ignoring the real equity issues surrounding us.</p>

<p>Coincidentally commenter Luis Enrique asked me what I thought of that paper on Gmail. </p>
<blockquote><p>this is commentator Luis Enrique [skip] I am enjoying your to and fro with Simon WL anyway, I just wanted to send you <a href="http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2012/04/forecasting-the-great-recession-dsge-vs-blue-chip.html">this link</a>, in case these guys are not on your RSS, as a continuation of sorts of your post on the Vox paper on the same topic</p></blockquote>
<p>My thoughts after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t actually have an RSS and, as I admit from time to time, don&#8217;t generally read the economics literature, so it was new to me.</p>
<p>The key part of the NY Fed post is the figures most of which simply show that both the models and the blue chip forecasters failed to forecast the great recession.  These are forecasts of quarterly GDP growth.  The explicit model based forecasts are red, the average of Blue Chip professional forecaster forecasts is green.  Blue indicates confidence intervals for the explicit model based forecasts.  Click one of the links for actually legible decently sized figures.

<blockquote>The chart shows the forecasts for three different DSGE specifications. We call the first one SWπ; this is essentially the popular Smets-Wouters model. The second is the Smets-Wouters model with financial frictions, as in Bernanke et al. and Christiano et al., which we call SWπ-FF. The other difference between this model and SWπ is the use of observations on the Baa-ten-year Treasury rate spread, which captures distress in financial markets.<br />The last specification is still the SWπ-FF, except that we use observations for the federal funds rate and spreads for the quarter that just ended and for which no National Income and Product Accounts data are yet available (for the January 10, 2009, forecasts, these would be the 2008:Q4 average fed funds rate and spreads). </p></blockquote>
<p>The DSGE models which do a bit better aren&#8217;t DSGE models. The Baa-Treasury spread is added as an explanatory variable without any discussion of micro foundations. The text makes it clear that this variable is added in addition to the frictions considered by Bernanke et al and Christiano et al.  Bernanke et al have the difference between a risky and risk free rate as an endogenous variable &#8212; it should depend only on the ratio of equity to the capital stock (IIRC).  It isn&#8217;t a free variable in that model and can&#8217;t be added in addition to the frictions considered by Bernanke et al.</p>
<p>I claim that the model which does poorly rather than terribly is an ad hoc aggregate model without micro foundations.</p>
<p>The outcome on the graph is not the BEA&#8217;s current estimate (-8% at an annual rate for 2008:Q4). This means that the outcome as re-estimated months before the publication date of the post is well outside of the 90% confidence interval except for the last panel which shows an ad hoc model using contemporary data.</p>
<p>Why no forecasts using data from the trough ? There is no evidence in the post that the DSGE model had any success forecasting the recovery. There are no forecasts which use 2008:Q4 BEA estimates flash, advanced or &#8220;final&#8221; (but not really final since they were corrected in 2011).</p>
<p>The good looking figure adds another variable ad hoc. Oddly it just happens to track the GDP growth rate very well in this episode.  It would not have a similar coefficient if estimated with more data &#8212; the spread has not been close to what it was in 2008-9 since 1962 (when the FRED 10 year constant maturity Treasury series I looked at started) but GDP shrank at the same rate in a quarter in 1980 as in 2008:Q8.  The past 5 years shows why adding the spread as an explanatory variable (even lagged one quarter) helps a lot.  In the figure I didn&#8217;t lag the spread as I should have and would have if I could have with FRED.  Even so, the peak is a bit to the right of the trough of GDP growth.  But the point is that even shifted to the right one quarter (to lag) the Baa &#8211; Treasury spread&#8217;s high level and rapid decline fits the steep decline in GDP in 2009:Q1 and then the rapid recovery.</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Kenneth Thomas</strong><br /><strong></strong>(reposted from Middle Class Economist)<br />     <br />Mike Kimel at <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/04/aei-economists-and-ugly-memory-hole.html">Angry Bear</a> has several nice posts on the &#8220;Laffer Curve&#8221; that underlies much of conservative economic orthodoxy in this country. As you may know, Art Laffer famously claimed that at tax rates of 0 and 100%, you would get zero tax revenue, and that in between, there is an inverted U shaped curve, where taxes collected first increase as the tax rate goes up, then decrease as tax rates go higher still, back down to zero tax collected when the tax rate is 100%.<br />     <br />The Kimel post linked above was prompted by an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, Alan Viard, telling the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/whats-the-easiest-way-to-cheat-on-your-taxes.html?_r=2&#038;ref=todayspaper&#038;pagewanted=all"><i>New York Times</i></a> that all economists know that when the top tax rate is 35%, cutting rates further will reduce tax revenue.<br />
<blockquote>“The Reagan tax cuts, on the whole, reduced revenue,” he explains. “The Bush tax cuts clearly reduced revenue. There is no dispute among economists about that.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Except, as Kimel points out, lots of conservative economists dispute this, including one who co-authored a paper with Viard! For his trouble, Kimel became the subject of a post at the <a href="http://blog.american.com/2012/04/angry-bear-bloggers-and-the-ugly-memory-hole/">AEI blog</a> by James Pethokoukis, which started by completely misidentifying him and going downhill from there. For Kimel&#8217;s enjoyable takedown of this post, see <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/04/american-enterprise-institute.html">here</a>.    <br />All this led me back to an earlier post of Kimel&#8217;s, where he makes <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">an empirical estimate of the Laffer Curve</a>, using U.S. data all the way back to 1929, the first year for which official U.S. data exists. I&#8217;ll spare you the technical details (see <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">Kimel&#8217;s post</a>), but here&#8217;s the bottom line: Laffer got it exactly backward, with tax revenue initially falling as tax rates increase, then rising after a further increase in rates. Here is Kimel&#8217;s estimate of the &#8220;true&#8221; Laffer curve:<br />    <br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGAGYeBkCe8/TqDnjFOCbbI/AAAAAAAAAn0/fgeWBTmmXBg/s1600/Figure%2B2.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" height="404" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KGAGYeBkCe8/TqDnjFOCbbI/AAAAAAAAAn0/fgeWBTmmXBg/s640/Figure%2B2.jpg" width="640"></a>    </p>
<p>Not only that, as one of Kimel&#8217;s commenters, Robert Waldmann points out, we actually have experience with a country having a top marginal rate over 100%, Sweden in the 1970s. Contrary to Laffer, not only was tax revenue not equal to zero, in 1975, Sweden&#8217;s tax revenue was 41.3% of gross domestic product! (<a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx">OECD statistics</a>, click on &#8220;data by theme,&#8221; then &#8220;public sector, taxation, and market regulation,&#8221; then &#8220;taxation,&#8221; then &#8220;revenue statistics &#8211; OECD member countries,&#8221; then &#8220;comparative tables&#8221;) 21.2% was central government revenue, i.e. excluding subnational government and social security. Either way, a long way from zero.<br />    <br />Not to belabor the point, but Viard was right about tax revenue after President Bush&#8217;s tax cuts. Here is the OECD data for the federal government, excluding Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. First we see the effects of President Clinton&#8217;s tax increase, then President Bush&#8217;s tax cuts.<br />    <br />Year Tax/GDP    <br />1992 10.7%    <br />1993 11.0%    <br />1994 11.3%    <br />1995 11.7%    <br />1996 12.2%    <br />1997 12.7%    <br />1998 13.1%    <br />1999 13.2%    <br />2000 13.5%    <br />2001 12.5%    <br />2002 10.4%    <br />2003 9.8%    <br />2004 10.0%    <br />2005 11.2%    <br />2006 11.9%    <br />2007 11.9%    <br />2008 10.4%    <br />2009 8.4%    <br />2010 9.1%    <br />Source: OECD, directions as above for Sweden<br />   <br />Before you supply-siders get too excited about the increase in 2006 and 2007 to 11.9%, remember that the higher Clinton tax rates brought in more revenue for five straight years, 1996-2000.    <br />Though many journalists get it wrong, chessplayers like myself know that &#8220;refute&#8221; means to conclusively disprove. And the Laffer Curve stands refuted. </p>

<p>A non-profit group estimates if the Affordable Care Act provisions had been effect in 2010, U.S consumers would have received $2 billion in rebates. <br />
<blockquote><a href="http://www.upi.com/topic/Sara_Collins/">Sara Collins</a>, vice president of the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation supporting independent research on health policy, said the medical-loss ratio rules that went into effect in 2011 were designed to control private insurance administrative costs for consumers and government.<br />The rules require a minimum percentage of premium dollars to be spent on medical care and healthcare quality improvement &#8212; not administrative costs and corporate profits. Insurers must meet a minimum medical loss ratio of 80 percent in the individual and small-group markets, and 85 percent in the large group market &#8212; and issue rebates if they do not, Collins said.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>PALM BEACH, FL — Mitt Romney went well beyond his standard stump speech at a closed-door fundraiser on Sunday evening, and offered some of the most specific details to date about the policies he would pursue if elected. <br />In a speech to donors in the backyard of a private home here, </p>
<p>[skip]</p>
<p>Romney went into a level of detail not usually seen by the public in the speech, which was overheard by reporters on a sidewalk below.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh my.  But what is striking is not that he says one thing to donors and another thing in public where swing voters can hear.  It is that there is almost no there there.  Mitt Romney&#8217;s secret plan to balance the budget and to avoid giving tax breaks to the rich would do neither.</p>
<p>Knock me over with a wrecking ball.  Briefly the secret plan is to eliminate HUD, cut the Department of Education, eliminate for high income families the second home mortgage deduction and &#8220;probably&#8221; deductions for state and local property taxes.  </p>
<p>Discussion and more quotes and gloats after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>On spending, Romney made it fairly clear that he mostly plans to change organisational charts </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take a lot of departments in Washington, and agencies, and combine them. Some eliminate, but I&#8217;m probably not going to lay out just exactly which ones are going to go,&#8221; Romney said. &#8220;Things like Housing and Urban Development, which my dad was head of, that might not be around later. But I&#8217;m not going to actually go through these one by one. What I can tell you is, we&#8217;ve got far too many bureaucrats.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course he didn&#8217;t say how many bureaucrats there are in Washington (and not in Northern Virginia at the Pentagon and CIA) because there are fewer than he assumes people assume.  He didn&#8217;t explain how merging departments cuts costs (hey look how well the Department of Homeland Security worked out).  Targetting HUD shows he wants it to be clear that he is cutting programs for poor (and black) people.  </p>
<p>I think he is vulnerable to questions about whether he wants to eliminate HUD programs (if so the CBPP or someone can calculate how many families will end up homeless) or just save a seat at the cabinet table.  Also one can note how small the HUD budget is compared to the spending cuts he has promised.  Any hook to make discussion of spending cuts specific is harmful to Romney as he depends entirely on the unpopularity of government spending in the abstract versus the popularity of government programs.</p>
<p>But the real oppo research (and comedy) gold is in the totally feeble tax proposals.  </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to probably eliminate for high income people the second home mortgage deduction,&#8221; Romney said, adding that he would also likely eliminate deductions for state income and property taxes as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;By virtue of doing that, we&#8217;ll get the same tax revenue, but we&#8217;ll have lower rates,&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact (already calcuated I forget where) is that those with the highest incomes would gain from his rate cuts even if they were deprived of all tax deductions.  But second mortgages ??? What a joke.  For one thing super rich people don&#8217;t have mortgages if they are not fools as mortgage interest rates are higher than safe rates available to them.  For another, the amount of money involved is tiny compared the the huge decline in revenues due to the rate cuts.</p>
<p>I ask people more industrious than myself (say at the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/">Tax Policy Center</a>)to toss in the possible elimination of the property tax deduction, define high income as income over $250,000 and run the numbers. The list of two (2) deductions to be partially eliminated reaches into one &#8220;likely&#8221; reform and so Romney can&#8217;t claim that there are other certain reforms which he didn&#8217;t mention.  The claim that those two tiny reductions in deductions make up for the rate cuts is clearly a pants on fire lie.  </p>
<p>Romney&#8217;s strategy of vagueness depends on not letting his statements about the details of his plans be overheard.  Now he can be asked again and again about how he made false claims about the effect on the deficit of proposals which can be scored.  This could be important if the Obama campaign doesn&#8217;t blow it (note I assume that the press won&#8217;t press Romney &#8212; also I don&#8217;t believe in the tooth fairy).</p>

                                <p>I don&#8217;t understand what Mohammad El-Erian is saying <a href="http://www.pimco.com/EN/Insights/Pages/Evolution-Impact-and-Limitations-of-Unusual-Central-Bank-Policy-Activism.aspx">here</a>.</p>
<p>I do entirely sympathise with this</p>
<p>
<blockquote>a professor &#8230;advised me that, in order to maximize the probability of success, I should &#8230; Make sure to cover issues where I know more than those who will be evaluating my work; and, in putting everything together, make sure that I mix and match among components that no one in their right mind would ever combine!<br />I did not listen to this professor’s advice back in 1980, and I have not done so today. Indeed, I have gone the other way! And in so doing, I suspect that I will get very close to – and perhaps even cross, though I hope not – that delicate line that every speaker faces and fears: the one that separates courage from stupidity.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is not a central banker.  I know almost nothing about real world finance.  This post will definitely demonstrate my ignorance, but it might be interesting anyway.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>update: My worse concern is that, while typing, I had the vague sense that Krugman had written something very vaguley similary to what I was typing. I fear I am passing off Krugman&#8217;s arguments (which I don&#8217;t remember) as my own. More than that, I fear I am a victim of Krugmanic possession and that I have lost my ability to think independently of him.</p>
<p>El-Erian&#8217;s main argument is that central banks can&#8217;t and shouldn&#8217;t bear the full burden of stimulating the economy, that is (I assume) there should be fiscal stimulus too.  I absolutely agree with that (although he doesn&#8217;t exactly explain what he means).  But his discussion of disadvantages of central bank interventions is very odd to me.</p>
<p>He seems to define the normal situation and the free market outcome to be the way things were before 2007. But the system was headed for catastrophe then.  It was distorted by the irrational confidence some had in the boundless wealth of investment banks and, for the less naive, by to big to fail moral hazard. 
<div></div>
<p>
<blockquote>There are also genuine concerns that such activism involves a range of collateral damage and unintended consequences, only some of which are visible at this stage. And there will be questioning whether all this continues to be justified by central banks’ impact on the overall economy.<br />Already, there are visible changes to the characteristics and functioning of certain markets. As an example, consider what is happening to the money markets segment.<br />With policy interest rates floored at zero for such an extended period of time (past and also prospectively, according to recent FOMC statements), this segment will continue to shrink – and will do so mostly from the supply side. Funds are being re-intermediated to the banking sector, with quite a portion ending up in excess reserves at the Fed. In the process, borrowers that previously depended on money market investors (think here of commercial paper issuers as an example) are having to find alternative sources of funding. </p></blockquote>
<p>First he seems to be saying that low interest rates are bad for borrowers.  He doesn&#8217;t quite say it, but what else does &#8220;having to find alternative sources of funding&#8221; mean ?  Why don&#8217;t they just pay enough on commercial paper to make money market funds attractive ?  I&#8217;d say it is obvious that they are using alternative sources of funding, because those alternative sources are very attractive, because FOMC policy is very stimulative.</p>
<p>But my more general objection above is based on the fact that El-Erian seems to assume that the capitalisation of money market funds in say 2007 was appropriate, so a change is &#8220;collateral damage.&#8221;  I have a rather different view of money market funds.  I consider them a fraud designed to evade necessary prudential regulation which, by itself, would have destroyed the US economy in the absence of public rescue.  They have been around for decades and worked fine until they collapsed entirely.  I think a reasonable level of their capitalisation would be zero &#8212; they are entirely based on a promise not backed by anything (like deposits before the FDIC) which works fine until there is a panic.  They were saved by a legal only in a crisis rescue.  How can their decline be &#8220;collateral damage.&#8221;</p>
<p>The idea always was that there are shares which are legally equity but which always happen to be equal one dollar.  Shareholders were not all aware that they owned shares not deposits and that there was no guarantee that a share would be equal to one dollar.  Since the shares are legally equity of a special purpose entity, parent corporations did not have to count them as liabilities when calculating capital ratios.  Nor did they have to hold reserves to redeem the shares.  Also they never paid the FDIC for insurance, but, it turns out they had it for free when they needed it.</p>
<p>The key to the whole approach was that the parent company made a market in the shares (so long as it could with no reason for people to have such faith that it always could given the absence of any prudential requirement for capital, reserves or insurance).  It seems to me that generally if firm A sets up firm B then buys and sells shares of firm B to make them more attractive to other investors we call it market manipulation and call in the SEC.  Sure doesn&#8217;t sound like arms length transactions at market prices to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m old enough to remember the silly regulation which money market funds got around.  Once upon a time there were tight restrictions on nominal interest on deposits (zero for checking accounts IIRC).  I remember when banks offered toaster ovens to people who opened accounts (since they couldn&#8217;t pay a market clearing interest rate).  I never had such an account (I was under 18 at the time).  This was a silly nominal rigidity (which by the way makes any time series econometrics which pools data from the regulation q era and the post regulation q era nonsense).  But it is long gone.</p>
<p>If the purpose of the funds is to convince people they have an asset as safe as a bank deposit without having to bother with capital or reserves, then I think the right policy response is to ban the funds. If the purpose is to get deposit insurance without paying for it, then I think the right policy is to ban the funds.  The people who set them up made a promise which people believed and which they couldn&#8217;t keep in a crisis.  A decline of that sector does not strike me as collateral damage.</p>
<p>Then</p>
<blockquote><p>The functioning of markets is also changing given the size and scope of central bank involvement. The result is artificial pricing, lower liquidity and a more cumbersome price discovery process.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh ? I don&#8217;t even know what this means (at all).  I don&#8217;t see the basis for the conviction that high trading volume (liquidity) is socially desirable.  I think this confuses the interest of expert traders (who benefit from a high volume of fools who are willing to buy what they want to sell and vice versa) with market efficiency. It seems to me that the less cumbersome price discovery process of the recent past was associated with high price volatility and gigantic misspricing of assets largely driven by the irrational trading of expert traders.</p>
<p>Also how does one reconcile these two claims</p>
<blockquote><p>The essence here was captured well in a recent investor remark reported by Bloomberg: “Investors are numb and sedated…. by the money sloshing around the system.”</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>Put differently, a view has evolved that the “trading” segment of markets, whose focus is understandably short-term, is now dominating the “investment” segment.</p></blockquote>
<p>So numb and sedated investors are focusing on the short term as is demonstrated by low liquidity (that is low trading volume).  I just don&#8217;t see how both claims can be true. </p>
<p>Somehow he seems to consider there to be a natural interest rate defined in a way very different than Wicksell defined it and that the current interest rates are lower.  So some interest rate is the free market rate and another one isn&#8217;t.  This sounds vaguely Austrian to me.  It doesn&#8217;t make any particular sense as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>American Enterprise Institute Economists Redux</p>
<p>The other day I wrote a post about economists at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a prominent conservative think-tank.  The post began with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/whats-the-easiest-way-to-cheat-on-your-taxes.html?_r=1&#038;ref=todayspaper&#038;pagewanted=all">this paragraph from a story in the NY Times</a>    <br />
<blockquote>Politicians sometimes say that lower tax rates lead to higher economic growth, which in turn leads to higher overall tax revenue. This may have been true in the early 1960s, when the top tax rate was 91 percent, but the top tax rate today is 35 percent. For decades, lower tax rates have led to lower government revenues, says Alan Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group. &#8220;The Reagan tax cuts, on the whole, reduced revenue,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;The Bush tax cuts clearly reduced revenue. There is no dispute among economists about that.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>I noted that while Viard is right about tax cuts reducing federal revenue, he is wrong about &#8220;There is no dispute among economists about that.&#8221;  As evidence, I pointed to a piece by his sometime co-author, Kevin Hassett and another by Glenn Hubbard, the first Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors under GW Bush.  Both, I might add, are with the AEI (Hubbard as a visiting scholar).  It wouldn&#8217;t take long to point to other quotes by other AEI economists disputing what Viard said is not disputable (and which, not incidentally, shouldn&#8217;t be disputable given the data.)      At the AEI&#8217;s blog, James Pethokoukis <a href="http://blog.american.com/2012/04/angry-bear-bloggers-and-the-ugly-memory-hole/">responded</a> to my post.  There is no polite way to say this, so I&#8217;ll just state it as it is:  his post is riddled with errors.  Let me cover several of them.   Of my post, Pethokoukis says this:   <br />
<blockquote>I have read it several times but I am not exactly sure of its Big Point other than to say nasty things about economists who either work at AEI or are affiliated with AEI.  What I think author Ken Houghton is trying to say, maybe, is that supply-side economics doesn’t work. </p></blockquote>
<p>There are three errors here, all of them concentrated in the last sentence:   </p>
<p>1.  The author of the piece is not Ken Houghton.  It is Mike Kimel.  As it says, &#8220;Posted by Ken Houghton&#8221; but &#8220;by Mike Kimel.&#8221; </p>
<p>2.  The piece is not trying to say that supply-side economics doesn&#8217;t work.  Alan Viard of the AEI is quoted as saying something which translates as follows:  at least since Reagan took office, the tax cuts we have seen have led to lower revenues.  I don&#8217;t know if Viard is willing to go further and endorse the implication of his statement about taxes and revenues, which is this:   since the top marginal tax rate was at 70% before Reagan took office, and tax cuts from that 70% level and below have led to reduced revenues, if the Laffer curve is more than just a theoretical construct, unless we have a reason to believe that the last thirty two years of US history are an aberration, it turns out that we will not get an increase from revenue from a tax cut unless the top marginal tax rate is somewhere in excess of 70%.  Like I said, that&#8217;s an implication of Viard&#8217;s statement.  </p>
<p>That is not a point of the post, although in the post I did note that it seems Viard had seen data and was being honest about what the data stated.  But that is only a point of the post in the sense that stating &#8220;the New York Times quoted AEI Economist Alan Viard&#8221; is a point of the post, which is to say, it isn&#8217;t a point of the post at all. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />3.  The point of the post is that while one AEI economist is willing to state the obvious about tax cuts, and though he may state that no economist disputes the obvious, his more prominent colleagues at the AEI do dispute what the data so obviously shows.  I went further, and noted that Viard had to know that his own institute is a big part of the problem.     Pethokoukis&#8217; next sentence:</p>
<p> &#8220;Supply-side economics is simply a school of economic thought that believes a) incentives matter, b) high tax rates are bad for growth, and b) inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon.&#8221;   </p>
<p>4.  I&#8217;ll ignore the grammatical error toward the end of the sentence &#8211; there are enough substantive issues in the post &#8211; and merely point out:  &#8220;incentives matter&#8221; is not something that defines supply-side economics any more than having two arms and two legs is a defining property of people of Swedish extraction.  </p>
<p>I have yet to meet an economist of any stripe who doesn&#8217;t believe incentives matter, just as I cannot think of any country whose citizens don&#8217;t typically come equipped with four limbs.  Its just that typically different schools of thought think incentives matter in different ways.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take Marxism as an example.  I&#8217;m no Marxist, nor do I personally know any Marxists, but Marx can be summarized as: &#8220;those with capital have an incentive to exploit the workers to increase their profits, and the workers have an incentive to throw off their shackles, leading to a revolution.  As long as there as a division of people due to ownership, those incentives persist.  Peace, happiness, and prosperity can only exist by getting rid of those incentives, but only a revolution followed by a dictatorship of the proletariat can achieve that.&#8221;  Now, whether Pethokoukis or I agree with this story (for the record, I don&#8217;t, and I&#8217;m pretty sure Pethokoukis doesn&#8217;t either), there is no question that incentives are part of the story.  And I think I can show very clearly that supply siders treat certain incentives as egregiously as the Marxists do, but that&#8217;s for another post.</p>
<p> &#8220;Back in the 1970s, Keynesian economists really didn’t believe any of that stuff and they dominated the economics profession.&#8221;   </p>
<p>4a.  This is kind of a continuation of the previous error, and it indicates Pethokoukis doesn&#8217;t understand the basic point that Keynes was trying to get across.  I would assume that it isn&#8217;t controversy to say that Keynes General Theory, which is the basis for everything one can call &#8220;Keynesianism&#8221; can be summarized as follows:  &#8220;When the economy slows, people buy less stuff, so manufacturers hire fewer people, pushing up unemployment and decreasing wages.  This in turn slows the economy even more, leading to even more even pressure on employment and wages.  But if the government were to start buying stuff, counteracting the reduction in demand from the private sector, it will decrease the pain companies feel, and thus decrease the layoffs and the downward pressure on wages, preventing the economy from getting worse and ending the recession sooner.&#8221;  </p>
<p>If someone can tell that story in a way that doesn&#8217;t require both companies and workers to have incentives, I&#8217;d love to hear it.  Alternatively, if someone can define Keynesian philosophy of any stripe in a way that doesn&#8217;t involve some variation of the story I just told, I&#8217;d love to hear that.    FWIW, here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/economy/GeneralTheoryKeynesIntro.html">Paul Krugman&#8217;s summary of the General Theory</a>:   <br />
<blockquote>Stripped down, the conclusions of The General Theory might be expressed as four bullet points: • Economies can and often do suffer from an overall lack of demand, which leads to involuntary unemployment  • The economy’s automatic tendency to correct shortfalls in demand, if it exists at all, operates slowly and painfully  • Government policies to increase demand, by contrast, can reduce unemployment quickly  • Sometimes increasing the money supply won’t be enough to persuade the private sector to spend more, and government spending must step into the breach</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if you prefer this formulation, its hard to say there aren&#8217;t incentives in the General Theory.     </p>
<p>5.  Most Keynesians do think higher tax rates slow economic growth.  In fact, back to Keyenes&#8230;. the flip side of having the government step in and spend money when the economy is slow is that, according to Keynes, when the economy is running full speed, the government should cut back on spending raise taxes.  One reason for raising taxes is to pay down the debt resulting from the deficit spending when the economy was in recession, but the other is to slow the economy to prevent it from overheating, thus prolonging the expansion.  For what its worth, I personally don&#8217;t think slowing the economy to prevent overheating fits what data we have, but Pethokoukis wasn&#8217; talking about me, he was talking about Keynesian economists in the 1970s.</p>
<p> &#8220;Today, pretty much everybody believes incentives matter, high taxes rates hurt growth and inflation is a monetary phenomenon. &#8221;   </p>
<p>6.  As I noted before, you could find that incentives matter in Marx and you could find it in Keynes&#8217; General Theory, the sources of two schools of thought to which most supply-siders will agree they are in opposition, both of which predate supply-side economics.  So the fact that pretty much everyone believes it today is a meaningless statement unless you can show that  Marx and Keynes were exceptions &#8211; they just happened to believe something that the supply-siders would later believe, but virtually nobody else other than Marx and Keynes held that supply-sider belief prior to the supply-siders.  Otherwise, we&#8217;re once again oohing and aahing over the fact that the overwhelming majority of Swedes have two arms and two legs.     </p>
<p>7. I&#8217;m not sure what Pethokoukis is saying when he says that everyone agrees that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, or that it is a big deal that everyone believes it now, except that he is slightly misquoting Milton Friedman.  That&#8217;s all very nice, but the belief that money affects inflation goes back a very long way.  Lenin, for instance, talked about debauching the currency.  Here&#8217;s Keynes, straight from the General Theory:   <br />
<blockquote>The view that any  increase in the quantity of money is inflationary (unless we mean by inflationary merely that prices are rising) is bound up with the underlying assumption of the classical theory that  we are always in a condition where a reduction in the real rewards of the factors of production will lead to a curtailment in their supply.</p></blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t sound like someone who doesn&#8217;t believe that the quantity of money is unrelated to inflation.  Its merely someone who believes that the quantity of money alone isn&#8217;t the only determinant of whether there is inflation &#8211; you aren&#8217;t going to have to fear inflation as much if there&#8217;s slack in the system.  To provide an obvious example of what Keynes was talking about almost eighty years ago:  I&#8217;m sure Pethokoukis knows how much the money supply has increased in this country since December 2007 and how little inflation we have had in that time.</p>
<p> &#8220;Supply-side economics is just economics, really. We’re all supply-siders now.&#8221;   </p>
<p>8.  Oh, really?  Well, as I noted above, Keynes agreed with the three beliefs that Pethokoukis ascribes to supply siders (incentives matter, higher tax rates slow growth, and inflation is a monetary phenomenon).  Yes, he had a different view of incentives than Pethokoukis, and he had some caveats on when money doesn&#8217;t affect inflation as much, but for the most part, by Pethokoukis&#8217; definition, Keynes was a supply sider, as are most of the folks he influenced.  (I note that I personally would not qualify as a supply sider by Pethokoukis&#8217; definition, which is to say, I don&#8217;t agree with Keynes on a key piece of that definition but that&#8217;s not the subject of this post.)</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, and the Laffer Curve? Just common sense.&#8221;   </p>
<p>9.  True.  But common sense is often wrong.  See, the dirty little secret of modern economics as practiced in the US these days is that if you apply the Laffer curve to US data, and by that, I mean, no cherry picking.  Use the entire series of US government data going back to 1929, the first year for which official data exists, estimate revenues = f(top marginal tax rate, top marginal tax rate squared) you get a quadratic function as Laffer said.  The only problem is &#8211; <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">its upside down.</a>  Results are not different from what Laffer claimed, they are absolutely and precisely the opposite.     Don&#8217;t take my word for it.  Do it yourself.  Anyone who took an intermediate level undergraduate econometrics course and has access to a spreadsheet can do it.   &#8220;</p>
<p>Economic historian Bruce Bartlett calls the Laffer Curve “a generally accepted analytical device … [that is] a widely discussed subject in respected academic journals.” &#8221;   </p>
<p>10.  Show me a group of physicists discussing phlogiston and I&#8217;ll show you a group of physicists who should be extremely embarrassed.  As I said above, anyone who took an intermediate level undergraduate econometrics course and has access to a spreadsheet can fit a Laffer curve.   It takes a bit more effort than that to check into whether phlogiston theory has anything to it.</p>
<p> &#8220;In 1980, the top U.S. marginal income tax rate was 70 percent; today it is 35 percent. Yet the share of total income taxes paid by wealthier taxpayers has risen sharply. That is powerful evidence that the United States was on the wrong side of the Laffer Curve back in 1980. &#8221;   </p>
<p>11.  What do the first two sentences have to do with the last sentence?  The Laffer curve is not about the share of taxes paid by the wealthier taxpayers. As Pethokoukis himself wrote a few paragraphs earlier:   <br />
<blockquote>There are two tax rates that generate zero tax revenue, 0 percent and 100 percent. And in between, there is some tax rate which generates a maximum, non-zero amount of tax revenue. As tax rates rise from 0 percent toward that level, tax revenues increase both through higher economic growth and greater tax compliance. Once beyond that inflection point, higher tax rates generate less tax revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, powerful evidence against the Laffer curve is, in fact, is provided by Pethokoukis&#8217; colleague Alan Viard of the AEI:   <br />
<blockquote>For decades, lower tax rates have led to lower government revenues, says Alan Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group. &#8220;The Reagan tax cuts, on the whole, reduced revenue,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;The Bush tax cuts clearly reduced revenue. There is no dispute among economists about that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, for me this is just a hobby &#8211; I don&#8217;t get paid for this.  I&#8217;ve already spent too much time at this and I have to get to work.</p>

                                <p>Guest post by Kenneth Thomas of <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/04/us-has-18th-best-unemployment-benefits.html">Middle Class Political Economist</a></p>
<p>U.S. has 18th best unemployment benefits in OECD; also trails 13 non-OECD countries</p>
<p>  Tim Vlandas at <a href="http://euwelfarestates.blogspot.com/2012/04/world-ranking-in-unemployment-benefit.html">EU Welfare States</a> flags some important recent International Monetary Fund data on the generosity of a number of countries&#8217; unemployment benefits. The metric used is the gross replacement rate (GRR) the ratio of unemployment benefits to a worker&#8217;s previous wages. </p>
<p>The United States gives, on average, a miserly 27.5% of previous wages in unemployment benefits, behind 17 OECD members, though ahead of 11 others (no data was given for OECD members Iceland, Luxembourg, Mexico, Slovak Republic, and Slovenia). Not only that, the U.S. falls behind 13 non-OECD members, including Algeria, Taiwan, and Ukraine, all of which have at least double the replacement rate of the U.S.    </p>
<p>Why is this important? As Vlandas points out,<br />
<blockquote>A high replacement rate&#8230;ensures that the negative effects of rising unemployment on aggregate demand are mitigated. It also prevents workers from falling into poverty when they lose their jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, the generosity of unemployment insurance interacts with the state of other employment protections. As regular readers of this blog will recall, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/labor-day-us-has-weakest-employment.html">the United States has the absolute worst employment protections in the OECD</a>, by a large margin compared to most other members. As commenter Norm Breyfogle rightly noted in response to that post, if your protection from both individual and mass firings are weak, you really need good unemployment insurance. As the data here show, however, U.S. workers are not well-protected with unemployment insurance.  </p>

<p>To compare it in another way, according to an <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11154.pdf">IMF working paper</a> (Figure 1, p. 21), the average GRR for high-income countries in 2005 was about 38%, compared to the United States&#8217; 27.5%. U.S. workers get relatively low unemployment benefits compared to other industrialized countries.  <br />Moreover, as I showed in February, the length of unemployment is at its longest since record-keeping started in 1947. The following FRED graph gives both the mean and median length of unemployment, both of which hit double their previous record in the current jobs recession.<br />  <br /><img alt="FRED Graph" height="384" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/fredgraph.png?&#038;id=LNU03008275,LNU03008276&#038;scale=Left,Left&#038;range=Max,Max&#038;cosd=1948-01-01,1967-07-01&#038;coed=2012-03-01,2012-03-01&#038;line_color=%230000ff,%23ff0000&#038;link_values=false,false&#038;line_style=Solid,Solid&#038;mark_type=NONE,NONE&#038;mw=4,4&#038;lw=1,1&#038;ost=-99999,-99999&#038;oet=99999,99999&#038;mma=0,0&#038;fml=a,a&#038;fq=Monthly,Monthly&#038;fam=avg,avg&#038;fgst=lin,lin&#038;transformation=lin,lin&#038;vintage_date=2012-04-14,2012-04-14&#038;revision_date=2012-04-14,2012-04-14" width="640"><br /><img alt="Loading ..." src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/images/loading.gif"><br />Loading &#8230;<br />Thus, in a country where employment protections are weaker than in any comparable nation, and which is still just below postwar records for length of unemployment, we face the additional problem of low unemployment benefits, a factor which exerts an additional drag on growth.</p>
