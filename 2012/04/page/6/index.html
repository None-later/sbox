                                <p>Correlations and Slopes Over Time</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/1-spending-as-fraction-of-net-worth-tim.html">Part 1</a>,  we looked at the ratio of consumption spending to net worth, and how it  changed over time.  This time we&#8217;ll look at the correlation between net  worth and consumption.</p>
<p>Here is the big picture: personal consumption expenditures (FRED Series <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/PCE">PCE</a>) plotted against Net Worth (FRED series <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/TNWBSHNO">TNWBSHNO</a>) Data is per calendar quarter.</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mYa96__tEx0/T4XnYhW8COI/AAAAAAAAByg/SiAR3E1QXiA/s1600/Consumption+vs+Net+Worth.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mYa96__tEx0/T4XnYhW8COI/AAAAAAAAByg/SiAR3E1QXiA/s400/Consumption+vs+Net+Worth.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 1  Consumption vs Net Worth, 1959 &#8211; 2011 </div>
<p>The data set is divided into two segments, with a break point at the  beginning of 1997, with net worth at $30,315 and consumption at $5,467.   In a close up view, there is a clear slope change there.  Still, the  selection is a bit arbitrary, since the high point of Q3, 1994, could  also have been chosen, with net worth at $25291, and PCE at $4856.  But  that is a detail, and no other reasonable breaks stand out.</p>
<p>Notably, both the slope of the data line and R^2 are significantly less  after the break.  Visually, it&#8217;s obvious that in the later data, there  is a lot more scatter.  Also note that that big data moves post 1997  return to the continuation of the best fit line, pre-1997.<br /><a name="more"></a>Slope and R^2 measurements for the entire data set and the two segments are presented in Table 1.  These numbers were generated using the linear trendline function in Excel.</p>

<p>We saw in part 1 of this series that the relationship of consumption to  net worth was not stable, so this result is not surprising.  And we can  now see that as net worth increases, the sensitivity of consumption to  increasing net worth decreases.</p>
<p>I can think of two contributing factors.  As wealth increases, the need  to spend on basic necessities captures a smaller portion of that wealth,  so the propensity to spend decreases.  I&#8217;ll defer consideration of the  other factor for now.</p>
<p>Here is a detailed look at how the slope of the PCE vs net worth line  varied over time.  Graph 2 shows the 34 quarter slope values for the  data points of graph 1.  The slope is plotted in dark blue, with certain  time spans highlighted in contrasting colors: recessions are in orange,  and the stock market and housing bubbles are in yellow.</p>
<div> <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X7S4GxdKU8s/T4YD4mBzJ7I/AAAAAAAAByw/1HD5Hfo5sks/s1600/Consumption+vs+Net+Worth+Slope.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-X7S4GxdKU8s/T4YD4mBzJ7I/AAAAAAAAByw/1HD5Hfo5sks/s400/Consumption+vs+Net+Worth+Slope.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 2 Slope of Consumption vs Net Worth </div>
<p>Observations:<br />1) Except for the bubbles and the spike in the post-bubble recession of  2008, the values are mostly contained between a low of 0.168 and a high  0.246.<br />2) There was an upward trend that ended in the mid-70&#8217;s, underscored with a blue line. <br />3) Values after the mid-70&#8217;s, including the two bubbles, are contained in a down-sloping channel, outlined in green.<br />4)  Except for the early 80&#8217;s and 90&#8217;s events, recessions are marked by sharp, temporary slope increases.<br />5) The average slope is 0.184, with a standard deviation of .038<br />6) The bubbles highlighted in yellow in Graph 2 correspond exactly to  the data points in Graph 1 that fall below the red best fit line. <br />7) The post-bubble recessions brought the slope back into the range  described in Observation 1.  This is illustrated in Graph 1 by the  returns to the blue best fit line.</p>
<p>If the normal relationship between net worth and consumption is  described by a slope in the range of around 0.17 to 0.25, what is there  about bubbles that causes drops into the range of 0.11 to 0.12 at the  peaks?  I think the answer is the second factor that I defered until  now.  The stock bubble and the housing bubble represented wealth  increases that were not shared equally across the population.   Specifically, as <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/02/income-and-consumption.html#more">I pointed out earlier</a>,  these assets are mostly owned by the richest population segment, and  growth in wealth has excessively favored the top 1% of the population.    They have the least propensity to spend, and this tendency drives the  PCE slope into the low range.</p>
<p>This FRED graph illustrates the point in a different way.</p>
<div> <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=6pu"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=6pu" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 3 PCE, Net Worth and Disposable Income</div>
<p>There are four lines, Net Worth in green (divided by 5 to put it on the  same scale); Disposable Income in purple, PCE in red, and Disposible  Income multiplied by 0.931 in blue.  Note that the last two overlap  almost perfectly, as I also pointed out earlier (see link above.)</p>
<p>The conclusions I&#8217;m drawing are<br />1) Since the bubbles increased wealth in a highly skewed fashion, the  relationship between average wealth and consumption broke down.<br />2) When the bubbles burst, the normal relationship between wealth and consumption reasserted itself.<br />3) The underlying cause is that during the bubbles the relationship  between wealth and income broke down, and afterwards reasserted itself. <br />4) The relationship between disposable income and consumption is robust across time and most extraordinary financial events.<br />5) All the foregoing suggest that if wealth distribution were more even  across the population (and thus more closely tied to disposable income,)  then the relationship between wealth and consumption would be more  robust.</p>

                                <p>The monthly trade data was reported this morning and you will see press reports about the nominal trade deficit.  But I like to look at the real trade data as it gives a better feel for the economic impact of trade.  The real trade deficit is improving and the balance in February was $44,148 million ( 2005 $) as compared to $48,294 million ( 2005 $) in December. I am<br />comparing the February to December because in the real GDP accounts they compare the change over the quarter versus the quarterly average for most of the economic series in the accounts.<br />This looks like a nice gain and implies that trade will make a nice contribution to first quarter growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k73hV4WsPWU/T4cAh-vedDI/AAAAAAAACDE/-q3aJxZ-sPg/s1600/Clipboard02%2BBALANCE.bmp"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-k73hV4WsPWU/T4cAh-vedDI/AAAAAAAACDE/-q3aJxZ-sPg/s320/Clipboard02%2BBALANCE.bmp"></a><br />But to understand what is happening to the trade data you need to look below the surface at some of the details.  We are really seeing a structural change in the US energy environment because of falling domestic demand and expanded output from fracking.  For the first time since oil became a major issue in the 1970&#8217;s we are starting to see a real possibility that over the next decade  the US could really achieve energy self sufficiency.  Drill, Baby, Drill is no longer just some silly political<br />campaign slogan.  The US probably will not actually achieve energy independence, but we should reach the point where we only import energy from other North American sources.  The US can<br />eliminate its direct dependence on Mideast oil. It is already starting to happen and on a net basis US real oil imports have been cut  almost in half from their 2005 peak.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mohd6pta7Fo/T4cATviFPZI/AAAAAAAACCs/tJD2-V60PHs/s1600/Clipboard02%2BBAL%2BOIL.bmp"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mohd6pta7Fo/T4cATviFPZI/AAAAAAAACCs/tJD2-V60PHs/s320/Clipboard02%2BBAL%2BOIL.bmp"></a><br />US petroleum exports, or reexports are now equivalent to roughly a third of gross imports.  Part of this is due to the current transportation bottlenecks that have created a surplus of oil in the interior and lead to West Texas Intermediate oil trading about $20/bbl cheaper than Brent crude.<br /><a name="more"></a>This is giving the Gulf Coast refiners a major competitive edge in world markets for refined oil products.  But is also becoming a major political issue over the Keystone XL Pipeline. The pipeline would allow Canadian Tar Sands oil to flow to the Gulf Coast refiners.  Of course, oil is fungible and if Canada exports their oil from their own ports it would have the same impact on world oil supply and demand and oil prices would be about the same  as if the Keystone pipeline is built. The pipeline would benefit the US, but most of the political claims are grossly exgerated.</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sMsMWGF2evw/T4cAZ0sEk-I/AAAAAAAACC4/VdQ3OpQLpU8/s1600/Clipboard02%2BBAL%2BXOIL.bmp"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-sMsMWGF2evw/T4cAZ0sEk-I/AAAAAAAACC4/VdQ3OpQLpU8/s320/Clipboard02%2BBAL%2BXOIL.bmp"></a>Even US non-petroleum exports have been surging.  But much of the surge is just the snap back<br />from the plunge in trade during the Great Recession. Real exports growth of non-petroleum products is slowing rapidly as the year over year growth rate has slowed to about 5% as compared to a peak rate of almost 20%. in 2010.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kvg2KwOxpBo/T4cA3M4AECI/AAAAAAAACDc/aC1OCqIbr7Q/s1600/Clipboard02%2BEXP%2BXOIL.bmp"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kvg2KwOxpBo/T4cA3M4AECI/AAAAAAAACDc/aC1OCqIbr7Q/s320/Clipboard02%2BEXP%2BXOIL.bmp"></a></p>
<p>Real non-petroleum imports are showing a similar trend where growth has slowed to about 5%<br />as compared to a peak growth rate of 30% in 2010.    Of course, imports are larger than exports so if they both grow at the same rate the trade deficit would widen.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I do&#8217;t want to be rude to anyone in particular, so I will just note that I have the impression that two people who should know better are willing to suggest that logically consistent models populated by rational optimizing agents have policy invariant implications, that is are not vulnerable to the Lucas critique.</p>
<p>This is obviously false. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a> </p>
<p>I will concede two points.  First the the objectives of the agents in the model are the same as the objectives of all agents in the real world and the constraints are the same as real world constraints, then the implications will be optimal predictions no matter what policy is implemented.  That is the models would work fine if they weren&#8217;t models but were rather the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth.  No one claims this, so this concession amounts to nothing at all.</p>
<p>Second, models can be useful approximatiions to reality.  A model is a useful approximation to reality if it yields approximately accurate predictions and conditional predictions.  This is to say that models which are not vulnerable to the Lucas critique are not vulnerable to the Lucas critique.  Noting this tautology, I have conceded nothing at all.</p>
<p>Beyond these two non concessions I will not go.  Internally consistent models with optimizing agents are not in general presumptively useful for policy analysis.  If one has two models neither of which fit the facts one of which is an ad hoc reduced form model and one of which is a consistent model with optimizing agents, there is no reason to use the internally consistent model for policy analysis.  If you have two models both of which fit the facts one of which is an ad hoc reduced form model and one of which is a consistent model with optimizing agents, there is no reason to use the internally consistent model for policy analysis.  Fitting the facts is no more reliable a guide to usefulness in policy analysis for an internally consistent model with optimizing agents.</p>
<p>The reason is that a fundamentally invalid model (meaning one which is not a useful tool for policy analysis) can fit the data well for one policy regime and poorly for another.  This is just as true of a model with optimizing agents but fundamentally false assumptions about objectives and constraints as it is for an ad hoc reduced form model.  I will attempt to argue that it is just exactly precisely as true and not one iota less true, but I am not sure I can measure truth down to one iota.  </p>
<p>Some examples.  It is not clear from the data whether people don&#8217;t want to do something or if they are prevented from doing it.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say it is 1990.  I could write down a model in which people of different types choose to marry if and only if this increases each spouses utility.  Looking at the data, I note that same gender couples don&#8217;t appear in marriage registers.  I conclude that gay people are not the marrying kind.  I predict this will remain true no matter how policy changes.  I am a total fool.  But the model had optimizing agents and was internally consistent.  </p>
<p>I can write down a model in which the labor market clears.  I can estimate labor supply parameters using micro data.  I note that men&#8217;s labor supply is extremely inelastic compared to women&#8217;s.  Based on this perfectly fine micro model with optimizing agents, I predict that employment of men will fluctuate much less from 1987 on then employment of women.  I am a fool.  The assumption that the labor market clears can be consistent with my micro data (I can assume the self declared unemployed are lazy and lying).  But I can&#8217;t explain the recent fluctuations.</p>
<p>If I had used US macro data from 1984 through 2007 to check my model, it would have looked OK.  </p>
<p>OK enough joking around.  Let&#8217;s consider a famous case of a bad model: the old expectations unaugmented Phillips curve.  This is, as noted by Krugman among others, the one and only example used for decades to justify the quest for consistent micro founded macroeconomics.  Here the current view is roughly that the true relationship between unemployment and inflation is that unemployment is related to inflation minus the best forecast of inflation conditional on information.  In the original now long abandoned Lucas model the information was all information available at the time unemployment and inflation are measured.  In New Keynesian models the relevant conditioning information must be older &#8212; in fact typically the statement is only approximately true and a better and better approximation the older the conditioning information).  The view from 1959 through 1974 (that is the whole Keynesian era) was that there is a stable relationship between inflation and unemployment.  The interpretation is that expected inflation was roughly constant in the times and places analysed by old Keynesians and it was implicitly assumed that something which happens to be roughly constant is constant.  This lead to terrible predictions in the 1970s.</p>
<p>Then the profession shifted to belief in a natural rate of unemployment.  The expected value of unemployment conditional on long ago information is constant (this is implied by the expectations augmented Phillips curve described above &#8212; otherwise it has no content).  There was a huge debate over whether the long term was a month (as required by Lucas) roughly a year or so (as interpreted by Barro who made Sargent lose his cool that way) or a few years.  </p>
<p>Guided by this insight, European policy makers decided that it would be a good idea to fight inflation at the cost of a few years of high unemployment.  Unemployment remained very high for a decade and a half.  It was decided that there was something wrong with European economies (basically trade unions and labor regulations) and that, if they were what economies are supposed to be, the models would have worked.  When the model didn&#8217;t fit reality, the conclusion was that the scientific thing to do was to reject reality.  </p>
<p>But note this means that the first confrontation with reality should have demolished the natural rate hypothesis.  The idea that the long term conditional average of unemployment is constant is similar to the idea that the long ago subjectively forecast rate of inflation is constant.  It might be true in general (&#8220;might&#8221; makes right) but it might also be that it just happened that policy had been such that it was true over the time period studied.  Anchored inflation expectations might exist only if policy makers do not tolerate persistent inflation.  A constant medium term average unemployment rate might exist only if policy makers do not tolerate long lasting fluctuations in unemployment.  The story about subjectively expected inflation was more appealing, because no one had good models of unemployment (while the rational expectations hypothesis is elegant and simple).  But the data were equally cruel to each assumption.</p>
<p>The result is that macroeconomics is based on models in which there isn&#8217;t a stable Phillips curve and there is a natural rate of unemployment.  Evidently some data are more equal than others.  </p>
<p>The really shocking thing is that the same economist (0.J. Blanchard) can switch from a model explaining why there is not a natural rate of unemployment to an estimation strategy which uses the assumption of a natural rate of unemployment for identification within two years without blushing.  The rules of what may and may not be assumed are respected, but they have nothing to do with evidence.</p>
<p>Back to history.</p>
<p>In any case, it was argued that reflation would cause intolerably high inflation (that means inflation) so there was nothing to be done but reform labor markets.  Then the stock market crashed in 1987.  This caused Margaret Thatcher to panic and force the Bank of England (not then independent) to reflate.  For a couple of years, the UK unemployed were criticized more harshly than ever, because there were many vacant jobs and unemployment didn&#8217;t fall quickly (evidently top economists were not familiar with the subtle concepts of a &#8220;stock&#8221; and a &#8220;flow&#8221; or of the relative plausibility of a stable Beveridge curve and a stable matching function  &#8212; well I&#8217;ve had to explain that to them again recently so I shouldn&#8217;t be surprised).</p>
<p>The the UK unemployment rate fell sharply.  There was a temporary increase in inflation.  The unemployment rate remained far below the Continental average.  The inflation rate converged back to very low.  The view that fluctuations in inflation are permanent and fluctuations in unemployment temporary was not damaged at all by the episode.  Instead the UK became one of the good Anglophone economies instead of being (as it had been) a key example of Eurosclerosis.    </p>
<p>Notably which countries are good and which are bad changes every decade, but the free market system can never fail, it can only be failed.  Following shocks a country can switch from being key examples of free markets working to key examples of government intervention failing and back within a few years.  That country is called South Korea (while on the peninsula I note that North Korea shows that some forms of government intervention are catastrophic).</p>

                                <p>As far as I <strike>can</strike> could tell, Simon Wren-Lewis has been convinced by Paul Krugman.  He <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.it/2012/04/microfoundations-and-evidence-1-street.html">now proposes </a>parallel reasearch projects one of which is to be focused on fitting the data.  This is exactly what Krugman advocated.</p>
<p>Update: clearly I couldn&#8217;t tell very far.  In fact, as he has repeatedly written, Wren-Lewis always agreed with Krugman about what is to be done.  I assume he still disagrees with Krugman about the fruits of the effort to micro found macro.  In any case, I missinterpreted his new parallel research program proposal.  It is the same as his original paralkel research program proposal.</p>
<p>Also he isn&#8217;t the one who caused the Bank of England model to have an ad hoc periphery around the consistent core.  That was the work of Bank of England employees.  Or something.  Just go to <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.it/2012/04/some-notes-on-macro-modelling.html">his blog</a> for more reliably correct corrections.</p>
<blockquote><p>In the real world the incentive for most academics is to get publications, often within a limited time frame. When the focus of macroeconomic analysis is on internal consistency rather than external consistency, then it is unclear whether this incentive mechanism is socially optimal. If it is not, then one solution is for all macroeconomists to work for central banks! A more realistic alternative might be to reprise within academic macroeconomics a modelling tradition which placed more emphasis on external consistency and less on internal consistency, to work alongside the microfoundations approach.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>My reading is that Wren Lewis has ceased to present the empirical research as subordinate to micro founded modeling.  He seems to accept a research project which developes on its own and not just as an indication for what should be added to consistent models including agents with rational expectations.  Wren-Lewis seems to have only a verbal quibble with Krugman who says the fashion was for models which are beautiful not true.  Wren Lewis notes that many of the models are ugly.  I&#8217;d consider the debate resolved essentially with Wren Lewis saying he is convinced.  I note that he started arguing for some role for non-micro founded models.  My guess is that, when the debate started, he thought what he wrote this time, but was trying to appeal to the profession which considers the micro founded models to be the only research of scientific value.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t let go of the debate however.  In the post to which I link above, Wren Lewis links to <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.co.uk/2012/03/microfoundations-and-central-bank.html">another post</a> in which he explains how he really modelled when advising the Bank of England. It turns out that he didn&#8217;t stick to micro founded models at all.  There was a &#8220;core model&#8221; which is logically consistent and features rational agents.  But the output of this model is just one input to ad hoc models used for actual forecasting.  </p>
<blockquote><p>If we take a microfounded model to the data, what we invariably find is that the errors for any particular aggregate relationship are not just serially correlated (if the equation overpredicts today, we know something about the error it will make tomorrow) but also systematically related to model variables. If the central bank ignores this, it will be throwing away important and useful information. Take forecasting. If I know, say, that the errors in a microfounded model’s equation for consumption are systematically related to unemployment, then the central bank could use this knowledge to better predict future consumption.<br />BEQM addressed this problem by splitting the model into two: a microfounded ‘core‘, and an ad-hoc ‘periphery’. The periphery equation for consumption would have the microfounded model’s prediction for consumption on the right hand side, but other variables like unemployment (and lags) could be added to get the best fit with the data. However this periphery equation for consumption would not feed back into the microfounded core. The microfounded core was entirely self-contained: to use a bit of jargon, the periphery was entirely recursive to the core.</p></blockquote>
<p>The hybrid model is not logically consistent (wealth evolves as if consumption were determined by the core model, but forecast consumption is different so budget constraints are not satisfied with equality in the hybrid model).</p>
<p>The interesting thing to me is that the example of core plus ad hoc was the model used to forecast consumption.  Some time ago when I challenged Wren Lewis to present a case in which micro founded models were useful in forecasting, he brought up consumption and noted that an old Keynesian model used by the Bank of England forecast lower than observed consumption.  Now he notes that the model which is currently used by the Bank of England for that very variable is an ad hoc internally inconsistent model.  This was the example he chose when defending micro founded models.  </p>
<p>Now he notes that the micro founded model might in the future be improved so that it gives useful forecasts (he mentions precautionary savings) but &#8220;might&#8221; makes right.  Such a claim can be made for any resarch program no matter how sterile. </p>
<p>I comment with my usual rudeness.  Just to be quick, the example shows that the Bank of England does not, in fact, use a micro founded model.  The model is written down, but it is over ridden when making forecasts.  In my comment I ask if there is any hint of any useful role of the &#8220;core model&#8221;.</p>
<p>I note that you provide neither evidence nor reasoning in support of the claim that Microfounded model building is a very important and useful thing to do.&#8221;. Notably the core-periphery hybrid model is vulnerable to the Lucas crtique. What does the core model add which is useful ? Having a model which is not confronted with the data written down adds what exactly ? Does the core-periphery model fit the data better than a model which is not based on adding inconsistent equations to a logically consistent core ?</p>
<p>You note someone&#8217;s (King&#8217;s I assume) determination to include a logically consistent core ( then add inconsistent equations before making predictions or guiding policy. As presented, this seems to be a matter of intellectual fashion. Evidence doesn&#8217;t appear in that stage of your story (as it does in the stage of adding ad hoc corrections to thecore model).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know where to put this, but Mankiw&#8217;s use of the word &#8221; scientists&#8221; has no connection with practice in the natural sciences in which, historically, theories bow to facts. Can he explain why he did&#8217;t write &#8220;mathematicians&#8221; ?</p>
<p>Finally, what basis is there for the claim that the &#8220;better journals&#8221; are better than other journals ? They are presented as journals publishing social science, but empirical success is not required. You note correctly that they have huge status in the field, but do not address the question of whether this has anything to do with science, reality, understanding, insight or intellectual progress.</p>
<p>Oh I am getting rude as usual. So, before hitting publish, I want to thank you on behalf of at least UK residents for not sticking with an elegant model which does not fit the data. As I understand this post you et al rendered a false but fashionable model harmless. This made the UK a better place and I applaud your intellectual courage.</p>

<p><strong>DAMNED LIARS</strong></p>
<p><strong>AND SOCIAL SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>There are liars, damned liars, and “non partisan experts.” The non partisan experts are expert liars, “non partisan” because that’s the best lie of all. A damned liar need not be an expert, but he is usually pretty clever at mixing “true” facts, or at least “facts you can’t prove are not true,” with false implications that lead the people he wants to deceive into hurting themselves with false conclusions. Those false conclusions are ideally tied to other ideas that the mark really, really wants to believe, so he is never really able to let go of the lie he has been taught.</p>
<p>Robert J. Samuelson is not an expert, but he gets all his “facts” from them pre-twisted and designed to mislead. He published a pretty good example of the art of deception on Easter Sunday in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/wouldroosevelt-recognize-todays-social-security/2012/04/08/gIQALChd4S_story.html" target="_blank">Washington Post</a>.</p>
<p>Good enough, in fact, that when I started to deconstruct the lies for this post, I soon saw that I was in for a long job.. one too long to expect readers to put up with. So I will have to content myself, and you, dear reader, with “pointing at” the truth and leave you to decide for yourself how far you want to go to understand it for yourself.</p>
<p>Samuelson begins by claiming that FDR would not approve of Social Security today because it has become &#8220;the dole&#8221; that Roosevelt tried to avoid. His argument is entirely fallacious. And, as it turns out, he is telling these lies in order to encourage us to change Social Security so that it BECOMES the dole. One can&#8217;t be sure that Samuelson recognizes this himself. A career of telling lies for money must do terrible things to a man&#8217;s brain.</p>
<p>Samuelson is very confused&#8230; or wants you to be confused&#8230; about the differences between &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; and “the dole” and &#8220;contributory&#8221; pension plans. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>He gets the history of the development of the Social Security idea exactly backwards. For a clearer understanding of that history I recommend &#8220;The Battle to Save Social Security,&#8221; by Nancy Altman.</p>
<p>But rather than get lost in the mazes of Samuelson&#8217;s mind, I will attempt to describe the development of &#8220;pay as you go,&#8221; not as a &#8220;plan&#8221; but as a fact on the ground. Let us begin by examining one of Samuelson&#8217;s lies&#8230; a very familiar one:</p>
<p>But now, demographics are unfriendly. In 1960, there were five workers per recipient; today, there are three, and by 2025 the ratio will approach two. Roosevelt’s fear has materialized. Paying all benefits requires higher taxes, cuts in other programs or large deficits.<br />This is intended to deceive. The ratio of workers to retirees will not cause large deficits or cuts in other programs, or higher taxes. The reason the ratio has changed over the years is mostly due to the arithmetic of phasing in a pay as you go plan.</p>
<p>Suppose there is a great nation in which workers have been working and saving for their future retirement by putting some of their earnings into bank accounts or into stocks and bonds. Then suppose that a great catastrophe comes to that nation and wipes out the savings. The older workers have lost the most..they had the most savings to lose. But even younger workers can now understand that their own future savings will be at risk of being lost just as the older workers have lost theirs. <br />The workers come up with a way to &#8220;insure&#8221; their savings. They agree to join a retirement insurance pool with a &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; financing plan. Every worker will contribute a small part of his weekly pay to a fund that will pay for the &#8220;benefits&#8221; of those who retire.</p>
<p>Suppose there are forty million workers. A million aged 64, a million aged 63, and so on down to a million aged 26 and a million aged 25. The first year there are forty million workers and zero retirees. The ratio of workers to retirees is 40 to zero. The next year the million 64 year olds turn 65 and retire. The 25 year olds turn 26&#8230; and a million new workers turn 25 and begin paying the “tax.” Now there are forty million workers and one million retirees. The ratio of workers to retirees is now 40 to 1. The next year another million workers will retire, and a million new workers will come in at age 25. Now there will be forty million workers and two million retirees.. the ratio of workers to retirees is now 40 to 2. And so on. But not forever. Because eventually some of the retirees will die, and eventually the number of retirees who die will be equal to the number of people who retire each year, so the ratio of workers to retirees will stabilize according to the life expectancy of retirees. If that life expectancy is about 12 years, the ratio of workers to retirees will stabilize at about 3 to 1. Note here that the ratio of workers to retirees is the same as the ratio of working years to retirement years for each worker (on average).</p>
<p>The workers designing our retirement insurance plan know this. They know that the early retirees will collect more in benefits than they paid in. But they decide that this is fair; in fact it is exactly what is needed: Those who will retire soon are those who have lost the most savings in the recent disaster, and have the least time to recover by saving up enough under a &#8220;contributory&#8221; financing plan. The workers also know that those older workers contributed to the previous system: a combination of welfare and old fashioned “honor your father and your mother” care of their own parents. The workers also know the older workers cared for them when they were younger and built the infrastructure by which they are able to make money at all. They “paid for” their retirement, even though the money did not go into the current plan. The workers understand that by ‘grandfathering in” the older workers they are merely doing the fair and honorable thing of providing a transition from the previous, failed, plan to the new, better, plan.</p>
<p>The workers also know that the younger workers will not be hurt by “paying for” the older workers. The younger workers will eventually pay the full cost of their own retirement. They will not have to pay “more” because part of that money was used to pay for those who went before them. This is one of the beauties of “pay as you go” : As long as new workers will need the same insurance, they will join the pool and their contributions will pay directly for the retirement of the older workers. But the new workers won’t lose anything by that because their own retirement will be paid for by the newer workers coming into the system.</p>
<p>This is not a Ponzi scheme. The workers ALL get what they are paying for, and they will keep coming into the system as long as they need a way to insure their own retirement.<br />The current ratio is near 3 to 1 and is expected to go to near 2 to 1. But this is not a catastrophe. The current payroll tax is about 6%. If 3 workers paying 6% of their pay can &#8220;support&#8221; one retiree. Two workers would need to pay about 9% of their pay to support one retiree. Or, and this is a better way to think of it, each worker would need to pay 6% to pay for a life expectancy of 12 years. If he expects to live 20 years, he will need to pay about 9%. This may look expensive to you until you realize it is exactly the amount of money you would need to save for twenty years of retirement whether there was Social Security or not. While it’s true you “might” do better on the stock market, it is also true you might do a whole lot worse. And having less than you need is much, much more painful than having more than you need is pleasurable.</p>
<p>The numbers are actually a little better than this, and it will take a long time to reach that 2:1 ratio, if ever. And if you read the Trustees Report&#8230; if you read it very carefully&#8230; it shows that under their predictions&#8230; including the increase in life expectancy and the reduced ratio of workers to retirees&#8230;the payroll tax would only have to be raised to just over 8% for the worker. <br />Moreover the need for the raise will be so gradual that it can be met by raising the tax an average of one half of one tenth of one percent per year while wages are going up over a full percent per year. This means that a tax increase of about forty cents per week each year, while wages are going up about eight dollars per week each year, would enable workers to continue to pay for their own retirement, as they always have, and would have TWICE AS MUCH MONEY in their pockets AFTER paying for their longer retirement as they have today.</p>
<p>This preserves the INSURANCE nature of Social Security. It will add NOTHING to &#8220;the deficit,&#8221; and it means YOU will get to collect YOUR money when the time comes without welfare &#8220;means testing.” having to beg the rich man to pay for it, benefit cuts, or increase in the retirement age&#8230;which you will not like, whatever you think while you are young.</p>
<p>If you read the Samuelson editorial, it is important to keep in mind that what Samuelson means by “contributory” is you “invest” in stocks and hope for the best while you build up your savings&#8230; exactly the plan that failed and led to the need for Social Security in the first place. There is nothing wrong with investing, but Social Security provides you with insurance “in case” you don’t do as well as you hoped. As the ad says, “priceless.”</p>
<p>You also need to keep in mind that Social Security contributes NOTHING to the deficit. It is NOT welfare. It is paid for entirely by the workers who will get the benefits. Social Security has NOTHING to do with “why America’s budget problems are so intractable.” That problem is caused by deficit spending to pay for arms buildups, actual wars, and recessions caused by the big money gambling schemes&#8230; that Samuelson’s friends want you to play with them.</p>
<p>Samuelson seems confused about “pay as you go.” He does not understand money at all. He thinks that if “your money” is used to pay the benefits of someone already retired that you have “lost” your money. But this is no more true than you have lost your money because when you put it in the bank, the bank gives it to someone else to use while waiting for you to ask for it back.<br />Samuelson cites Sylvester Schieber. I have not read Schieber’s new book. But his “The Real Deal” was a collection of clever lies. Schieber qualifies as a “non partisan expert.”</p>
<p>Samuelson says “Americans believe (falsely) that their payroll taxes have been segregated to pay for their benefits&#8230;” This is a lie. There is nothing false about the segregation. It is the law. Your payroll taxes pay for your benefits. No other taxes pay for your benefits, and your taxes cannot be used for any other reason. They do not contribute to “the deficit” in any way.</p>
<p>Samuelson seems to think that the fact that you receive more in benefits than you paid for&#8230; “even assuming (again, fictitiously) that they had been invested” is an argument AGAINST Social Security. It looks to me like an argument FOR it. You get more in benefits than you paid in, because the benefits are paid for out of taxes on incomes that increase over time, even when the tax rate does not. This IS an investment. It is an investment in the growth of a “corporation” called The United States of America.</p>
<p>Samuelson is conflating Social Security with Medicare. The growth in medical costs predicted over the next century will require that the Medicare tax be increased, or that medical costs be brought down. But cutting Medicare will not lower medical costs, and it’s a pretty stupid idea to cut your insurance because you expect your medical costs to increase.</p>
<p>Finally, Samuelson, after saying that Roosevelt would hate Social Security today because it is “the dole,” a statement that is a lie, calls for us to ask “who among the elderly need benefits?” because he thinks we need to turn Social Security into a needs based welfare program&#8230; the “dole.”<br />As I said, when a man chooses to tell lies for a living, it must do terrible things to his brain.<br />Social Security is an “entitlement” because YOU HAVE PAID FOR IT. Don’t let the liars confuse you. It does not need to be “fixed.” All of the “fixes” on the table are stealth plans to destroy it. They want your money for their gambling games, and they hate the idea of workers having the security to EVER be able to say, “I have enough. Now I want to retire and do something with my remaining years better than working for the boss.”</p>

                                <div>“I’ve never seen a less optimistic time in my lifetime in this country and people wonder why,” the first-term Republican governor said at the Bush Institute Conference on Taxes and Economic Growth in New York City.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“I think it’s really simple. It’s because government’s now telling them ‘stop dreaming, stop striving, we’ll take care of you.’ We’re turning into a paternalistic entitlement society,” he said.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“That will not just bankrupt us financially, it will bankrupt us morally because when the American people no longer believe that this a place where only their willingness to work hard … determines their success in life then we’ll have a bunch of people sittin’ on a couch waiting for their next government check,” Christie said.

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That, pretty clearly, is the message that the Republicans, party-wide, have settled on for this election: People are depressed because of the existence of the social safety net and other government programs such as student-loan and job-retraining programs, and because the very wealthy haven’t had their tax rates cut enough, the gap between the very wealthy, and all those couch potatoes who work regular jobs isn’t large enough.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I wish them all the best with that message.  And I hope they keep pushing it, all the way to November. </p>
<p>I think it’s simple, too. I&#8217;ll leave it at that.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Can’t wait to hear the <i>next</i> installment of Christie’s VP audition script.  Maybe something about all those auto-industry-worker couch potatoes who’ve stopped dreaming and striving now that Obama has handed GM and Chrysler to the UAW?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>By the way, did Christie ever use the student-loan program, I wonder?  Or did he, like Romney and Romney’s kids, have no need for it?
</p>
</div>

<div>Christie was speaking at the Bush Institute Conference on Taxes and Economic Growth. Tomorrow’s audition will be by Paul Ryan. It’s a follow-up audition, actually.</p>

                                <p>by <a href="http://presimetrics.com/">Mike Kimel</a></p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/whats-the-easiest-way-to-cheat-on-your-taxes.html?_r=1&#038;ref=todayspaper&#038;pagewanted=all"> an article in the NY Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p> Politicians sometimes say that lower tax rates lead to higher economic growth, which in turn leads to higher overall tax revenue. This may have been true in the early 1960s, when the top tax rate was 91 percent, but the top tax rate today is 35 percent. For decades, lower tax rates have led to lower government revenues, says Alan Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group. &#8220;The Reagan tax cuts, on the whole, reduced revenue,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;The Bush tax cuts clearly reduced revenue. There is no dispute among economists about that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess we can credit Viard with actually looking at data on taxes and revenues, and having at least enough honesty not to obfuscate results.</p>
<p>Sadly, there is a dispute among the folks who call themselves economists about that, and it seems particularly easy to find that category of economists among the type of folks who are willing to associate themselves with the American Enterprise Institute.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://aei.org/article/economics/fiscal-policy/taxes/laffer-curve-pays-billions-if-obama-just-asks/">Kevin &#8220;Dow 36,000&#8221; Hassett</a> of the AEI, not incidentally co-author of Viard with a paper currently highlighted on the AEI&#8217;s website:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans have asserted for years that just about all tax cuts pay for themselves. They&#8217;ve almost always been wrong about that. But with regard to corporate taxes, it&#8217;s true.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Hassett notes in his piece, the top US corporate rate in 2010 was 35 percent.  Note the Viard quote shown earlier.</p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s AEI visiting scholar R. Glenn Hubbard, previously the first Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under GW Bush, and as we all remember, a huge advocate of tax cuts all around.  I found this old <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/archives/001351.html">Brad DeLong post</a> from Hubbard&#8217;s White House days.  DeLong quoted, in its entirety, this letter by Hubbard that was printed in the Washington Post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Washington Post <br />Low Taxes and Growth for All <br />January 4, 2003; Page A15 </p>
<p>A Dec. 16 news story in your paper stating that a Republican economist does not care about the deficit and wants to raise the tax burden on the poor was too good for Michael Kinsley to check [&#8220;Republicans Go Positive on the Deficit,&#8221; op-ed, Dec. 23]. Had he checked the complete text of my Dec. 10 speech, it would have been clear that I believe the fiscal position does matter and that a pro-growth policy with lower taxes for everybody makes sense.</p>
<p>The president is committed to fiscal discipline, and he rightly believes it is important to balance the budget. The deficit we now face is caused by national emergency, war and recession. We must keep in mind that growth leads to surpluses, not vice versa. Promoting economic growth and job creation is the aim of the administration&#8211;and this will lead back to a balanced budget. At the same time, the peer-reviewed economics literature shows that long-term interest rates do not go up in lockstop with the budget deficit. This is apparent from recent history.</p>
<p>The Dec. 16 article and Kinsley suggest that by acknowledging the challenges inherent in fundamental tax reform, the administration favors increasing taxes for some individuals. But the record makes clear this is not the case: The president and this administration know that lowering taxes for everybody leads to growth. This continues to be the sound policy of the administration.</p>
<p>&#8212; R. Glenn Hubband, Chairman, Council of Economic Advisers</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice&#8230;  he talks about &#8220;fiscal discipline&#8221;  but he is very clear, &#8220;growth leads to surpluses.&#8221;  Fiscal discipline is important, but it isn&#8217;t what leads to surpluses.  The only way that is true is if the faster growth generated by tax cuts leads to increased tax collections.</p>
<p>Note that this was 2003&#8230; and Hubbard and his boss had already given us tax cuts in 2001 and 2002. </p>
<p>Anyway, I can go on, but it seems to me Viard&#8217;s comment is merely part of a concerted effort to scrub a large history of very, very bad economic forecasts down the memory hole.  Sorry, but unless and until Viard calls out some his big name colleagues by name, it is going to be just as hard to take him seriously as it is to pretend that folks like Hubbard and Hassett don&#8217;t have a long history of promoting very damaging policies, and doubling down when those policies blew up.</p>
