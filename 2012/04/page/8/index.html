<p> America Shows No Increase in College Graduation Rates over the last 30 Years</p>
<p><a href="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/what-are-we-doing/">Jared Bernstein</a> (via <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/30/we-dont-need-no-education/">Paul Krugman</a>) highlights an amazing breakdown in the prospects for reducing economic inequality any time soon. Over the last 30 years, the U.S. has made no progress whatsoever in increasing college graduation rates. To be specific, 25-34 year olds in 2009 had a college degree rate of about 40%, almost exactly the same as for 55-64 year old baby boomers. In the meantime, other industrialized countries were racking up substantial gains, most spectacularly in the case of South Korea where a little over 10% of 55-64 year olds have college degrees, but more than 60% in the 25-34 age group do. If you want to understand how South Korea has gone from a poor developing country to an industrial powerhouse within our lifetimes, this is one big reason.    </p>
<p>Here are the overall results for OECD and select non-OECD countries for the two periods:    </p>
<p><a href="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/oecded1.png"><img alt="" height="367" src="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/oecded1.png" title="oecded" width="547"></a>    </p>
<p>As we can see, the U.S. has fallen from a tie for second with Canada among current OECD members (Russia is not a member) to 15th in the OECD. The big question is why this is happening. One major reason is <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/07/heritage-tries-to-mislead-us-on-how.html">rising college costs</a>, which have far outstripped overall inflation.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JDyefbz_8AU/T32PCheP-SI/AAAAAAAAA1A/EtrgxAUcCx0/s1600/tuition.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="145" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JDyefbz_8AU/T32PCheP-SI/AAAAAAAAA1A/EtrgxAUcCx0/s320/tuition.PNG" width="320"></a></p>
<p>Note: Average annual rate of growth of published prices in inflation-adjusted dollars over a 10-year period. For example, from 2000-01 to 2010-11, average published tuition and fees at private four-year colleges rose by an average of 3.0% per year beyond increases in the Consumer Price Index. See link above for further data on tuition and fees plus room and board.</p>

<p>As we can see, the rate of cost increase for public four-year universities was the most rapid of all. One big reason for that, of course, is reduced state support of higher education. Citing State Higher Education Executive Officers, the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/documents/fiscal/HigherEdFundingFINAL.pdf">National Conference of State Legislatures</a> reports that state appropriations per student, at $6928 in fiscal year 2009, was more than $1000 below its FY 2001 peak, and lower in real terms &#8220;than in most years since FY 1980&#8221; (p. 1). </p>
<p>As Bernstein argues, Pell grants are one way to offset this problem, and he points out that the Obama administration has strengthened the program. However, the Ryan budget would slash Pell grants, among many other programs, in order to fund a tax cut for millionaires of almost $400,000, per Bernstein.    </p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/events/2012/01/krueger.html">Alan Krueger</a> noted in January, there is a strong relationship between higher inequality and lower social mobility. The OECD data show that the U.S. is making no progress on one of the most important tools for social mobility, college. If access to higher education in this country actually declines, as it is threatening to do, our inequality problem will become infinitely harder to solve.  </p>

<p>ECB Rates Policy is Clogged in Key Periphery Markets</p>
<p>How the Euro area (EA) will grow, <a href="http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120404.en.html">according to Mario Draghi</a>:<br />
<blockquote><em>The outlook for economic activity should be supported by foreign demand, <strong>the very low short-term interest rates in the euro area</strong>, and all the measures taken to foster the proper functioning of the euro area economy.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>In this post, I address Draghi’s point that the ECB 1% refi rate will support economic activity through the lens of the mortgage market. Specifically, I find that the interest rate channel is clogged in the economies that are in most desperate need of lower rates: Spain, Portugal, and Italy.</p>
<p>Regarding ‘very low short-term interest rates’, what Draghi means is that the standard interest rate channel of monetary policy will stimulate domestic demand via increased spending by consumers and firms. If ECB policy is indeed passing through to retail credit (households and firms that borrow from banks to buy goods and services), then we should see evidence of this as falling interest rates to retail credit sectors, like those for consumer goods, home mortgage lending, loans for businesses, or even corporate credit rates to finance business investment.</p>
<p>In mortgage markets, the Euro area average borrowing rates are indeed falling. Banks started lowering mortgage borrowing rates, on average, in September 2011 in anticipation of ECB <a href="http://www.ecb.int/stats/monetary/rates/html/index.en.html">rate cuts that eventually occurred</a> (again) in November 2011. Specifically, average Euro area mortgage rates are down roughly .25% since the local peak in August 2011.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/04/rates_policy.jpg"><img alt="" height="395" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/04/rates_policy.jpg" width="545"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />But a closer look across mortgage markets shows a worrying trend for key periphery economies. The pass-through from ECB rate setting policy to mortgage borrowing costs is clogged in Spain, Portugal, and Italy, where mortgage rates have risen since the ECB cut the refi rate to 1%. Indeed, these are the economies that ‘need’ the stimulus to offset the fiscal consolidation.<br />Sure, mortgage rates are arguably low – but they’re not <em>lower</em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/04/mortgage_rates_country.jpg"><img alt="" height="395" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/04/mortgage_rates_country.jpg" width="537"></a></p>
<p>In Spain and Portugal, 91% and 99% of their respective new stock of mortgages sit on variable rate loans, so the pass through to the real economy should be rather quick IF mortgage rates declined (see Table below). True, Spain and Portugal are unlikely to experience any boom in real estate lending over the near term. However, had the ECB policy lowered mortgage rates, then disposable income would rise via lower monthly mortgage payments, thereby stimulating other sectors of the economy, all else equal.</p>
<p>In Italy, just 47% of the mortgage market is variable, so the immediate stimulus would be more muted compared to Spain and Portugal via disposable income. However, Italy didn’t experience a credit boom, so lending to firms and households could and should be warranted. But amid the fiscal consolidation and stressed debt markets, fewer borrowers are credit worthy AND mortgage rates have risen near 1% since EA mortgage rates peak on average in August 2011.</p>
<p>Core mortgage rates are falling, and this could create a positive stimulus for Spain, Portugal, and Italy down the road. But for now, the transmission mechanism, dropping the ECB refi rate to 1%, is not easing housing and mortgage financial conditions in those economies hit hardest by fiscal austerity.</p>

<p>Explaining Why Low Tax Rates are Correlated with Slower Economic Growth, Once Again  </p>
<p>One of the regular mysteries facing economists is why the US economy fails to display evidence of a relationship that everyone seems to accept implicitly, namely that lower taxes lead to (or even are correlated with) faster economic growth.  Sure, the argument is sometimes made by academics using rather heroic assumptions.  The paper everyone seems to cite these days uses the assumptions made by politicians before a change in the tax rate as the &#8220;effect&#8221; that actually occurred after the change in the tax rate.   Non-academics rely on other heroic assumptions.  My favorite is attributing the rapid growth during the three years of the Kennedy administration to a cut in tax rates that occurred the year after he died.  (Actually, even Alan Greenspan made this one well before he made the transition from Maestro to goat.)     </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken a crack at explaining that puzzle, most recently <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/simple-explanation-for-strange-paradox.html">here</a>:   <br />
<blockquote>people will want to minimize their tax burden at any given time subject provided it doesn&#8217;t decrease their lifetime consumption of stuff plus holdings of wealth. Put another way &#8211; all else being equal, peoples&#8217; incentive to avoid/evade taxes is higher when tax rates are higher, and that incentive decreases when tax rates go down. Additionally, most people&#8217;s behavior, frankly, is not affected by &#8220;normal&#8221; changes to tax rates; raise or lower the tax rates of someone getting a W-2 and they can&#8217;t exactly change the amount of work they do as a result. However, there are some people, most of whom have high actual or potential incomes and/or a relatively large amount of wealth, for whom things are different. For these people, some not insignificant amount of their income in any year comes from &#8220;investments&#8221; or from the sort of activities for which paychecks can be dialed up or down relatively easily. (I assume none of this is controversial.) <br /><a name="more"></a>Now, consider the plight of a person who makes a not insignificant amount of their income in any year comes from &#8220;investments&#8221; or from the sort of activities for which paychecks can be dialed up or down relatively easily, and who wants to reduce their tax burden this year in a way that won&#8217;t reduce their total more or less smoothed lifetime consumption of stuff and holdings of wealth. How do they do that? Well, a good accountant can come up with a myriad of ways, but in the end, there’s really one method that reigns supreme, and that is reinvesting the proceeds of one’s income-generating activities back into those income-generating activities. (i.e., reinvest in the business.) But ceteris paribus, reinvesting in the business… generates more income in the future, which is to say, it leads to faster economic growth.  To restate, higher tax rates increase in the incentives to reduce one’s taxable income by investing more in future growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Restating again:  when the tax rate is 75%, a business owner has a strong incentive to reinvest all his/her profits in the business rather than take those profits out and consume them.  This is because reinvesting in the business means the profits aren&#8217;t pulled out and thus aren&#8217;t recognized as income by the IRS.  Reinvesting in the business also increases the business&#8217; chances to do well in future years, which generates growth for the economy.  On the other hand, when the tax rate is 15%, there is more of an incentive to take out profits and engage in consumption of the type that does not generate much growth.     </p>
<p><a href="http://uneasymoney.com/2012/04/03/why-low-marginal-tax-rates-might-have-harmful-side-effects/">David Glasner</a> has another (albeit complementary) suggestion:   <br />
<blockquote>The connection it seems to me is that doing the kind of research necessary to come up with information that traders can put to profitable use requires very high cognitive and analytical skills, skills associated with success in mathematics, engineering, applied and pure scientific research. In addition, I am also positing that, at equal levels of remuneration, most students would choose a career in one of the latter fields over a career in finance. Indeed, I would suggest that most students about to embark on a career would choose a career in the sciences, technology, or engineering over a career in finance even if it meant a sacrifice in income.  </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If for someone with the mental abilities necessary to pursue a successful career in science or technology, requires what are called compensating differences in remuneration, then the higher the marginal tax rate, the greater the compensating difference in pre-tax income necessary to induce prospective job candidates to choose a career in finance. So reductions in marginal tax rates in the 1980s enabled the financial sector to bid away talented young people from other occupations and sectors who would otherwise have pursued careers in science and technology. The infusion of brain power helped the financial sector improve the profitability of its trading operations, profits that came at the expense of less sophisticated financial firms and unprofessional traders, encouraging a further proliferation of products to trade and of strategies for trading them.</p></blockquote>

<p>“Fear and Loathing” of Wall Street, 2012</p>
<p>To-date, the presidential primaries have studiously avoided reference to the unfolding catastrophe brought to the American public just four years ago by the financial services industry. The political issues contested thus far bring to mind Hunter Thompson’s reporting of the 1972 election campaign:<br /><i>“This may be the year when we finally come face to face with ourselves; finally just lay back and say it — that we are really just a nation of 220 million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns . . .”</i><br />(See: “Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail, 1972,” By Hunter S. Thompson)</p>
<p>Off the campaign trail, however, Stanford University scholar Lindsey Owens <a href="http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/1/142.abstract">writes</a> to tell us:</p>
<p><i>“Animosity toward banks, financial institutions, and Wall Street has been an important part of the public discourse since the bank bailouts of 2008. Indeed, Americans’ confidence in all three institutions has plummeted accordingly in the years since. </i></p>
<p><i>[W] hile changes in the business cycle have an effect on public opinion in this domain, it is the economic contractions that correspond to major scandals in the financial sector that motivate the largest shifts in confidence and provoke the most public outrage.”</i></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Self-Loathing on Wall Street?</p>
<p>Professor Owens’ <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/wall-street-firms-admit-responsibility-for-poor-reputation-2012-03-26">study</a> of public opinion of Wall Street over the past 30 years suggests that even writer Hunter Thompson’s common man understands the difference between normal changes in the business cycle and financial industry scandals that actually contract real economic activity. Some of the geniuses on Wall Street also get it. In a recent poll by a corporate public relations firm (and long-time defender of financial services companies), a majority of Wall Street marketing executives admitted their industry’s own behavior caused its PR problems. Interestingly, 74 percent said <i>“that increased regulation of the financial services industry will help their firms improve reputations and trust with customers.”</i></p>
<p>In a similar vein, consider the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html?pagewanted=2&#038;_r=1">“cry in the wilderness”</a> of the Goldman Sachs derivatives salesman who publicly resigned via the New York Times over the firm’s routine “ripping off of clients”:</p>
<p><i>“I attend derivatives sales meetings where not one single minute is spent asking questions about how we can help clients. It’s purely about how we can make the most possible money off of them. If you were an alien from Mars and sat in on one of these meetings, you would believe that a client’s success or progress was not part of the thought process at all. It makes me ill how callously people talk about ripping their clients off. Over the last 12 months I have seen five different managing directors refer to their own clients as ‘muppets.’ “ </i></p>
<p><i></i><br />Feds Deny Wall Street Execs the Expiation of More Regulation</p>
<p>Sadly, if guilt-riddled Streeters truly want more regulation and reform, this year may mark the rare non-event of Wall Street not getting what it wants from government. Indeed, enactment of the so-called JOBS legislation – a bill with massive bi-partisan Congressional support eagerly signed by the President – may prove the antipathy of what financial marketing executives desire. Here’s what SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar said in a March 26 statement about the “Jumpstart our Business Start-ups Act”: </p>
<p><i>“I  </i><i>share <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/2012/spch031612laa.htm">the concerns</a> expressed by many that [the JOBS bill]. . . would be a boon to boiler room operators, Ponzi schemers, bucket shops, and garden variety fraudsters, by enabling them to cast a wider net, and making securities law enforcement much more difficult. Currently, the SEC and other regulators may be put on notice of potential frauds by advertisements and Internet sites promoting “investment opportunities.” H.R. 3606 would put an end to that tool. Moreover, since it is easier to establish a violation of the registration and prospectus requirements of the Securities Act than it is to prove fraud, such scams can often be shut down relatively quickly. H.R. 3606 would make it almost impossible to do so before the damage has been done and the money lost.” </i></p>
<p>Fear of Wall Street at Regulatory Agencies?</p>
<p>Loathing and self-loathing of Wall Street hasn’t gotten us very far. This is, in part, because of fear of Wall Street – fear that it may not continue to dish out the $14 million plus given to Congressional candidates in the election cylce ending June 30, 2011, and fear that it may take legal action should government bite the hand that feeds it. It is the latter fear that apparently makes regulators timid about implementing even the modest reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires new rules to reign-in the wild derivatives market, among other changes.</p>
<p>First, a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/25/opinion/sunday/a-long-road-to-regulating-derivatives.html?_r=1&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=derivatives&#038;st=Search">New York Times editorial</a> on March 24 summarized the problem with derivatives:</p>
<p><i>If there is one lesson from the financial crisis that should be indelible, it is that unregulated derivatives are prone to catastrophic failure. And yet, nearly four years after the crash, and nearly two years since the passage of the Dodd-Frank law, the multitrillion-dollar derivatives market is still dominated by a handful of big banks, and regulation is a slow work in progress. That means Americans, and the economy, remain at risk. . . . Unreformed, [derivatives] will cause havoc again.</i><br />Secondly, numerous media explained why neither the Times nor honest Wall Streeters will get the regulation they crave. Underwriters and marketers of derivatives have evidently filed frivolous lawsuits against the feds, making regulatory personnel fearful of writing new rules required by law.</p>
<p> Here’s how <a href="http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/Securities/News/2012/03_-_March/U_S__regulators__paralyzed__by_lawsuit_threat__Chilton/">Reuters</a> reported it on March 8:</p>
<p><i>Some U.S. regulators are &#8220;paralyzed&#8221; by the threat of lawsuits from Wall Street firms seeking to slow or stop the rollout of rules that would crimp their bottom line . . . Bart Chilton, a commissioner at the Commodity Futures Trading Commissioner, said if regulators live in fear of a lawsuit alleging they failed to consider sufficiently the costs and benefits of a rule, rulemaking slows or halts and opponents have succeeded. Regulators, already months behind in implementing rules from the Dodd-Frank financial reform law passed in 2010, are bracing for additional legal challenges as more regulations are completed.</i></p>
<p>Turns out, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association have already filed two lawsuits on behalf of JP Morgan Chase, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley alleging the CFTC did not adequately consider the costs to industry of new regulations on speculative derivatives based upon oil, gas and other commodities.

<p>Fear and Loathing of Wall Street: Private Investors Pick-up Slack</p>
<p>Fortunately, as timid federal regulators move at a snail’s pace, private investors led by pension funds are actually taking action against the underwriters of spurious derivative products, misrepresented sub-prime mortgage backed securities products and other hooligans along with their professional enablers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, although the number of resolved securities class action lawsuits alleging fraud and other wrongdoing (typically led by institutional investors) declined overall in 2011 to 65 from 86 in 2010, settlements by <i>underwriter defendants in such </i><i>lawsuits </i><i>matched</i> <i>an all-time high of 26</i> <i>percent of the total</i> (of all securities class action settlements) reached in 2010. And, $1.36 billion was recovered for investors through all securities class action settlements approved by federal courts in 2011.</p>
<p>Last year’s largest legal victory for shareholders was the $208.5 million won from the officers, directors, the underwriter and auditor of Washington Mutual bank, the first and largest bank to fail in the then unfolding sub-prime mortgage and derivative catastrophe.<br />Read more <a href="http://mobile.reuters.com/article/Deals/idUSBRE82D08820120314">here</a>.</p>
<p>SEC Two Months Late in Fulfilling Dodd-Frank Obligation</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Supreme Court decisions eliminating private accountability for those who knowingly enable securities fraud (<i>Central Bank</i> and <i>Stoneridge</i>) and immunizing from liability in America foreign based fraudsters who prey upon US investors (<i>Morrison</i>) continue to limit the ability of private actions to enforce securities laws and protect the public.</p>
<p>And, speaking of <i>Morrison</i> and foot dragging on implementing the lawful reforms of the Dodd-Frank Act, as of March 19, the SEC was two months late in issuing a report to Congress on whether or not the anti-US investor <i>Morrison</i> decision should be overturned. </p>
<p>Apparently, federal regulators cannot fully decide just whose side they are on: the American people they are empowered to protect or the financial services firms they are empowered to regulate?<br />Fear and loathing of Wall Street may be universal sentiments among the public, thoughtful financial executives <i>and</i> the federal government during this election year.</p>

Guess he’s had a change heart, after unilaterally disarming for the last three years.”)

</p>
<p>
<div>The New York Times is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/us/politics/obama-attacks-house-gop-budget.html?_r=1&#038;partner=rss&#038;emc=rss&#038;src=igw">reporting </a>on its website:</div>
<div></div>
<div>President Obama opened a full-frontal assault Tuesday on the budget adopted by House Republicans, condemning it as a “Trojan horse” and “thinly veiled social Darwinism” that would greatly deepen inequality in the country.…
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the latest of a series of combative speeches, the president said Americans could not afford to elect a Republican president at a time of fragile economic recovery, with a weak job market and a crushing national debt from “two wars, two massive tax cuts and an unprecedented financial crisis.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The widening gulf between the rich and everyone else, Mr. Obama said, was hobbling the country’s economic growth. He cited studies that found that societies with less income inequality had stronger and steadier growth.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“In this country, broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few,” the president said, according to excerpts of his address. “It has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class. That’s how a generation who went to college on the G.I. Bill, including my grandfather, helped build the most prosperous economy the world has ever known.” …
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But the president reserved his harshest words for the 2013 budget proposal recently passed by the Republican-controlled House. The budget, drafted by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, calls for $5.3 trillion in spending cuts, as well as tax cuts for households earning more than $250,000.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Disguised as a deficit reduction plan, it’s really an attempt to impose a radical vision on our country. It’s nothing but thinly veiled social Darwinism,” Mr. Obama said. “By gutting the very things we need to grow an economy that’s built to last — education and training, research and development — it’s a prescription for decline.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m absolutely thrilled. Obama’s finally picking up the gauntlet that the Repubs have thrown down, and, calling that spade the spade that it is, is throwing it back.  Hard.  Clear. And with real precision.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>By far the most important parts of what he said are, I think, his references to the WWII generation’s use of the GI Bill and how it effectuated class mobility and helped spur the tremendous economic growth of the three postwar decades, and his actual citation to studies showing that societies with less income inequality had stronger and steadier growth.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hooray.  Hooray!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But I hope he goes even further and compares the tax rates during the 1950s, ‘60s, ‘70s, ‘80s and ‘90s—including capital gains taxes and estate taxes—with today’s tax rates established during the G. W. Bush presidency and, even more important, with the tax rates proposed by the current Republicans.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Yup.  George Romney and Edward Davies, Ann Romney&#8217;s father, amassed their wealth during Socialism.  They must have been economic Houdinis.  Or  corrupt Commie officials.</div>
<div>
</div>
<p>
<div>I hope Obama also discusses what those higher tax rates bought.  The interstate highway system, for example, and the student loan programs and significant aide to state universities that helped finance so many baby boomers’ college educations.  And that he points out, again and again, that in January 2001 we had no budget-deficit problem because we were raising most of the federal tax revenue needed to pay for most of our federal needs.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Specifics.  Statistics.  To refute the damn lies and the soundbites and clichés.  And to illustrate the consequences.  A picture really <i>is </i>worth a thousand words.  Even if the picture is drawn in words.</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here&#8217;s one such picture, already framed: In his State of the Union address earlier this year, Obama acknowledged the problem of spiraling college tuitions and its effect on the ability of college-age members of the so-called working- and even middle-class to attend college, and on the longer-term economic effects upon those who do, using college loans that leave them owing massive debts upon graduation.  Not even to mention the long-term effects on the economy from this huge aggregate debt.  He suggested penalties, in the form of reductions in federal funds, for colleges and universities that don’t find ways to curtail the tuition hikes. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>A day or two later, Linda posted a fact-based refutation, pointing out that the main reason for the incessant tuition hikes at public universities is the incessant cutting of state funding for those universities, necessitated all the more by the economic downturn since 2007 and the resulting decrease in tax revenues and increase in recession-related expenditures.  Not long afterward, I read—I don’t remember where—that one major state university, which was not identified in the article, has seen its state funding reduced from 80% of its total revenue sources to 20% within (I think) the past two decades.  The result, as some longtime professors at state universities lament, is that the student bodies at these schools are now, unlike in earlier relatively-recent times, largely from upscale families, and very few are from working-class families. The level of federal financial assistance to states for colleges and universities obviously impacts this significantly.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’d love to hear Obama use this as an example to illustrate that the starve-the-beast juggernaut has broad and profound societal consequences. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’d also love to see Obama ask rhetorically what people think will be the consequence of the Republicans’ budget if, during the next economic downturn there  is no funding for unemployment compensation, a need that obviously is in an inverse relation to the unemployment rate and therefore to tax revenues.  And what will we cut from the budget in order to provide emergency disaster funding for, say, hurricane damage?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But today was a terrific start.  It’s statistics and other specifics that matter.  And today, for once, he provided some.  Hopefully, it was <i>just</i> the start.  
</p>

<p>The Best Data on Middle Class Decline (Updated)</p>
<p>The flurry of posts earlier this month on middle class decline (<a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/basics-real-wages-remain-below-their.html">me</a>, <a href="http://lanekenworthy.net/2012/03/11/is-decoupling-real/">Lane Kenworthy</a>, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/03/13/decoupling_is_real_but_median_incomes_are_growing.html">Matthew Yglesias</a>, <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/03/middle-class-really-three-decade-slump">Kevin Drum</a>) made me think some more about what the best way is to show what&#8217;s happened since the peak of real wages in the early 1970s. While in my opinion there is no perfect measure, there are a lot of choices to be made, and I argue below why real wages for production and non-supervisory workers, with an adjustment for non-wage compensation, is the best single measure.    </p>
<p>Choice 1: Household/family vs. individual</p>
<p>While we all live in households or families, over the past 40 years, there has been a decline in persons per household (see Kenworthy) and an increase in incomes per household as women&#8217;s labor force participation has increased. The decline in persons per household means that a household needs less income than in the past to have a fixed per capita income. The increase in incomes per household has meant that households have had higher real income even as real individual income has fallen, as pointed out by commenter peggy_Boston in the comments thread of Drum&#8217;s article. To my mind, this is partly causal; that is, <i>because</i> real wages have fallen, families have had to have more incomes in order to maintain their living standards. Indeed, falling real wages have forced families to run up high levels of debt, with non-mortgage debt reaching <a href="http://bostonreview.net/BR30.5/warrentyagi.php">1/3 of family income by 2005</a>. Therefore, I think individual data is the right choice here.</p>
<p>Choice 2: Median income vs. production and non-supervisory workers&#8217; income    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />The median (middle value, with an equal number of observations above and below it) has big advantages over the arithmetic mean in trying to show the typical situation in a distribution of values. It is especially useful for income distributions, where the presence of very high incomes means that the mean is much higher than the median. In fact, the literature on &#8220;decoupling&#8221; (see Kenworthy above) demonstrates just how much this is the case. But I think that &#8220;production and non-supervisory workers&#8221; captures our intuition about who is in the middle class even better than the median does. </p>
<p>This series, in Table B-47 of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/ERP-2012/pdf/ERP-2012.pdf"><i>Economic Report of the President</i></a>, is an average of the earnings of employed persons in private (non-government), non-agricultural jobs. It includes about 80% of the private workforce and 64% of the total non-agricultural workforce. Despite being an average, its exclusion of supervisory workers means that virtually all of the extremely high values that distort the mean of the entire workforce are eliminated. It is, essentially, the mean income of the bottom 80% of private workers. The biggest drawback to this dataset is that it does not include non-supervisory government workers, but I think that is outweighed by its broader coverage of the middle class than the pure median income (or middle quintile, as in Kenworthy&#8217;s post).</p>
<p>For the counterargument, that changes in composition of production &#038; non-supervisory workers can cause distortions that the median wage is not subject to, see <a href="http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/growth_failure_2007_04.pdf">Dean Baker</a> (p. 9).    </p>
<p>Choice 3: Weekly vs. hourly   <br />Baker mentions hourly earnings rates in some cases. As I discussed in the comments section of my March 11 post, the decline in hours worked per week (from 36.9 hours in 1972 to 33.6 hours in 2011) suggests to me that we need weekly, not hourly, wages.    </p>
<p>Choice 4: Which inflation data to believe?   <br />Shortly after President Clinton&#8217;s first election, I predicted to my students that, because his message of middle-class stagnation (&#8220;It&#8217;s the economy, stupid&#8221;) was dependent on how inflation was measured, that conservatives would soon attack the official Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation data. The issue is, if inflation is overstated, then the decline in real wages reported by the BLS could be overstated or even non-existent. Conversely, if BLS data understates inflation, then real wages have fallen even faster than shown in Table B-47.    </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did not publish this prediction, so you&#8217;ll have to take my word for it that I predicted the attack on inflation data that culminated in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boskin_Commission">Boskin Commission</a> in 1995. I always took this to be a political attack rather than a scientific one. My attitude has always been that trade theory (i.e., the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem; see Ronald Rogowski&#8217;s great book <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/4510.html"><i>Commerce and Coalitions</i></a> for an explanation of this topic, which I intend to discuss in a later post) predicts that real wages in a relatively labor-scarce country like the United States will fall as trade expands, and the data shows that real wages indeed fell: so what reason do we have to question the data? In the end, though, the Commission concluded that inflation was being overstated by about 1.1 percentage points a year, and the BLS was mandated to adjust its methodology.<br />    <br />Barry Ritholtz <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/01/why-michael-boskin-deserves-our-contempt/">takes an even more jaundiced view</a> of the Boskin Commission than I do. <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/18/inflation-conspiracy-theories/">Paul Krugman</a>, on the other hand, is not convinced that inflation is now significantly underreported, citing the work of the <a href="http://bpp.mit.edu/usa/">Billion Prices Project</a>. For the moment, I do not see reason enough to toss out the BLS data, despite the possibility that the Boskin Commission may have introduced distortions into it.    <br />Choice 5: Wages vs. compensation   </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w13953.pdf">Martin Feldstein</a> and other economists argue that it is not sufficient to look at wages alone, because the non-wage share of compensation has been growing over the past few decades. As I posted before, total employee compensation includes everyone from the CEO to the janitor, so it overlooks the fact that the top 1% have made almost all the gains from decades of economic growth. Nevertheless, it is clearly true that non-wage compensation has grown faster than wages, as we will see below. In fact, <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/03/13/decoupling_is_real_but_median_incomes_are_growing.html">Yglesias suggests</a> that the 2000s actually saw real compensation growth at the median, but it was all in the form of health insurance benefits. Of course, there is some debate over how much value actually comes from extra employer payments for health insurance, as Baker&#8217;s paper (p. 10) details</p>
<p>A different way to factor in compensation that I had seen before on the Economic Policy Institute&#8217;s website was explained to me in an email by Jared Bernstein and is documented in the footnote of his blog post <a href="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/what-does-it-mean-when-romney-says-%E2%80%9Ci-understand-the-economy%E2%80%9D/">here</a>. It takes the ratio of total compensation to total wages, both of which are in National Income and Product Accounts <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=53&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2009&#038;LastYear=2011">Table 1.12</a> (you can set it to a wider range of years, as I did). Whereas he applies it to median wages, I apply it to Table B-47 and get the following results:</p>
<p>Year Weekly Real Earnings Comp/Wages Weekly Compensation    <br />(1982-84 dollars) (1982-84 dollars)    <br />1972 $341.83 1.14 $388.01    <br />1975 $314.75 1.16 $366.63    <br />1980 $290.86 1.20 $348.93    <br />1985 $285.34 1.22 $347.10    <br />1990 $271.12 1.21 $328.99    <br />1995 $267.07 1.22 $326.23    <br />2000 $284.79 1.20 $341.49    <br />2005 $284.99 1.24 $352.87    <br />2010 $297.67 1.24 $370.28    <br />2011 $294.78 1.24 $365.77    <br />Note: Last two columns rounded from spreadsheet calculations    <br />Sources: Economic Report of the President 2012, Table B-47, National Income and Product Accounts, Table 1.12, and author&#8217;s calculations     <br />By this measure, compensation in 2011 for most workers was still almost 6% below its 1972 peak. The advantage of this adjustment over Feldstein&#8217;s procedure is it strips out the wage inequality of the compensation data, although there is still some overstatement based on inequalities in non-wage compensation. Still, I think this gives us our most accurate picture of what&#8217;s happening to the bottom 80% of workers. </p>
<p>That is not to say that this is a perfect measure even with those caveats. It matters what is happening at the top, too. If high wage earners were seeing their income fall faster than middle-class workers, then inequality would be falling and we would probably object less to what would then look like the much-vaunted &#8220;shared sacrifice.&#8221; But of course, as Kenworthy notes, the share of the top 1% more than doubled from 1979 to 2007, from 8% to 17%. With inequality rising as it is, we now seem to be in danger of a consequent <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2012/03/23/451166/acemoglu-income-inequality-political-powe/">sharp shift of political power</a> to the 1%, as MIT economist Daron Acemoglu told Think Progress&#8217; Pat Garofolo.     <br />I look forward to your comments, <i>especially</i> if I&#8217;ve gotten something wrong.    <br />UPDATE: By way of comparison, here is <a href="http://lanekenworthy.net/2012/03/11/is-decoupling-real/">Lane Kenworthy&#8217;s</a> chart.<br /><img alt="" src="http://lanekenworthy.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/isdecouplingreal-figure2-version5.jpg?w=380"><br />In it, you can see that by either median family income or 3rd quintile household income, incomes started rising shortly after 1980, whereas in my table compensation-adjusted real wages continued to fall until 1995. You can also see the divergence in median family income and Q3 household income between 2000 and 2007, as noted by Yglesias. Whereas the increase is made up entirely of nonwage compensation in the Q3 household income series, in my table at the individual level we have an increase made up partly of wages and partly of nonwage compensation.</p>

<p>Congressman Ryan’s Health Care Booby Trap</p>
<p>  Much has been said about “repeal and replace” it has become almost as much a part of GOP lexicon as “drill baby, drill”.  The GOP despite having been supportive of the framework for the ACA previously, wants badly to discredit the administration and claim a victory in the name of “freedom”. Too bad history shows that the Heritage Foundation and VP Stuart Butler supported a plan almost virtually identical to the ACA.</p>
<p>  Now, along comes Congressman Ryan, despite being rebuffed last year for the “Roadmap”, he has come along with a v 2.0. Unfortunately, he is making headway. I won’t comment on the other aspects of the new and improved Roadmap, but it seems to be just as much of a disaster as the previous one. The House has already passed it of course, and Romney, aka etch a sketch, has enthusiastically received the Congressman’s endorsement and has endorsed Ryan’s plan as well.</p>
<p>So we know that the GOP, primarily the Tea Partier’s, despise the individual mandate as a violation of their freedom. Ezra Klein had a great article last week about the hidden mandate in the Ryan bill , but does not discuss the fact that it will <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/there-was-a-reason-conservatives-once-supported-the-individual-mandate/2012/03/30/gIQAiddnlS_blog.html" target="_blank">essentially eliminate employer based insurance</a>. Now, Ryan’s plan assumes that the state based exchanges (sound familiar?) will produce a lot of savings, and he assumes that market forces will do even more. To that end, he offers a couple of tax credits. But, oh by the way, you LOSE employer based coverage under Ryan. It severs it completely. So an individual gets a 2,300 dollar tax credit (family is 5,700) to buy insurance. I can tell you now, that the average per the Kaiser Family Foundation for a single individual is much higher than 2,300. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Family plan premiums are $15,073 on average, while coverage for single employees is about $5,429.  </p>
<p>Workers contributed an average of $921 toward the premium of single coverage and $4,129 for family plans.   </p>
<p>What this means, is, that under the Ryan plan, your single insurance premium will cost you 2,208 MORE per year out of your own pocket at current cost. Family plans will cost you 5,244 MORE per year out of your own pocket.  </p>
<p>That&#8217;s the repeal and replace plan folks&#8230;..That&#8217;s what the House voted on and passed&#8230;..That&#8217;s what Romney endorsed&#8230;.THAT&#8217;s the GOP plan&#8230;  </p>
<p>It&#8217;ll save businesses money, and it&#8217;s great for corporate America. However, it is not so great for the average small family living on 40-45k per year combined income.</p>

<blockquote>WASHINGTON (AP) — The costly Republican primary has been draining Mitt Romney’s wallet and giving President Barack Obama time to build an expansive campaign architecture with offices in 45 states and hundreds of employees.<br />The bad news for Obama is he’s had to start paying for all this now.<br />Obama has spent more than $135 million — more than GOP challengers Romney and Rick Santorum combined — on his re-election apparatus, according to an Associated Press analysis of Federal Election Commission records. That sets up his campaign to be larger and geographically more diverse than any of his opponents’ organizations.<br />Through the first two months of the year, Obama spent approximately $1.1 million on computer equipment, $435,000 on rent and utilities, $305,000 on telephones and $19,000 on office supplies, according to federal reports.<br />Republican contenders Romney and Santorum have been watching their expenses during the GOP primaries, relying on a fraction of the amount Obama can spend on essentials like ad spending, travel fees and utility bills. But Obama’s campaign has its eye on spending by Republican-leaning “super” political action committees, which can accept unlimited and effectively anonymous contributions from billionaires, corporations and others.</p></blockquote>
