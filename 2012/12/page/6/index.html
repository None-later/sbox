                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Louise Story&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/us/how-local-taxpayers-bankroll-corporations.html">series</a> in the <i>New York Times </i>this  week has created a substantial buzz about the issue of economic  development subsidies.This is a welcome development, because it&#8217;s an  issue that doesn&#8217;t get nearly enough attention in the highest profile  media. Story has, in addition, appeared on shows such as MSNBC&#8217;s  &#8220;Morning Joe&#8221; and NPR&#8217;s &#8220;Fresh Air,&#8221; bringing subsidies to an even wider  audience.</p>
<p>She crafted a number of stories that  highlighted the big picture issues: imbalance in bargaining power  between city governments and giant multinational corporations, the  blatant conflicts of interest on display in Texas subsidy procurement,  and a border war between Kansas and Missouri involving multimillion  dollar incentives to move existing facilities across the state line,  with no net benefit for the Kansas City metropolitan area, let alone for  the U.S. as a whole.</p>
<p>The last few days have given me  time to absorb the articles and the database Story created, as well as  surveying the commentary on the web from well-known experts on  subsidies. Several tentative conclusions seem in order.</p>
<p>First, as I pointed out in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/12/nyt-80-billion-in-state-and-local.html">my last post</a>, and backed up by Timothy Bartik&#8217;s <a href="http://investinginkids.net/2012/12/04/all-business-incentives-are-not-created-equal/">detailed analysis of Michigan</a>,  5/8 of the national total is in the form of sales tax breaks, and  probably the overwhelming majority of those sales tax reductions should  not be considered subsidies. Here is what Bartik says about Michigan:<br />
<blockquote>For example, in my own state of Michigan, the New York <i>Times </i>database  identifies $6.65 billion in annual state and local business incentives.  Of this total, $4.83 billion is in “sales tax refund, exemptions, or  other sales tax discounts”.  Of this $4.83 billion, almost all of these  refunds come from two provisions of Michigan tax law. First, Michigan  does not apply the sales tax to most services, including business  services, which saves businesses $3.88 billion annually. Second, for  manufacturing, Michigan does not apply the sales tax to goods used as  inputs to the manufacturing process, which saves manufacturers about  $0.92 billion in sales tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>For those keeping score  at home, that means that $4.80 billion of the $4.83 billion in sales tax  breaks should not be considered subsidies, unless you consider  manufacturing &#8220;specific&#8221; enough that this aid constitutes a subsidy, in  which case only 80% of the sales tax breaks should be excluded from the  subsidy tally.</p>
<p>Second, changes of this magnitude mean that the <i>Times</i> estimates are not sufficiently accurate to use in a statistical analysis, as <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/jobs-and-economy/2012/12/uselessness-economic-development-incentives/4081/#">Richard Florida</a>  attempts in The Atlantic Cities. Finding out if incentives affect  outcomes like wages, employment, or poverty is precisely the type of  analysis we would like to do, but the fragility of the data makes this  premature. The good news is that since the data on these state programs  are all in one place, it should be possible to get a better handle on  state incentives by cutting out those programs which should not be  considered subsidies. Different analysts will no doubt have different  judgments about what should be counted as a subsidy, but since the  database is so inclusive, it should be useful no matter what your  definition of subsidy is.</p>
<p>Third, there are some smaller  errors in the program database as well. The one I have identified so  far is that it counts net operating loss (NOL) tax provisions as  subsidies in Illinois and New Hampshire, but not in other states, even  though all states with a corporate income tax will have an NOL  provision. In any event, this should not be considered a subsidy at all,  but a part of a state&#8217;s basic macroeconomic framework. In addition,  Timothy Bartik pointed out to me in correspondence that the program  database does not include single sales factor apportionment (only  counting what percentage of a multi-state firm&#8217;s sales take place in a  given state, rather than standard three-factor apportionment that uses  percentages of payroll and property as well) as a subsidy, which it  should.</p>
<p>Fourth, the program database does not  distinguish between investment incentives (subsidies to affect the  location of investment) and subsidies more generally, which may or may  not require an investment to obtain them. This is an important  distinction I have tried to make clear by providing separate estimates  in <i>Investment Incentives and the Global Competition for Capital</i>:  $46.8 billion in incentives, and $65 or $70 billion in subsidies,  depending on whether or not you count non-specific accelerated  depreciation as a subsidy.</p>
<p>Finally, as Phil Mattera at Good Jobs First <a href="http://clawback.org/2012/12/06/summing-subsidies/">points out</a>,  the deals database misses a number of large awards, leaving out  Tennessee&#8217;s $450 million (present value) subsidy to Volkswagen and an  even bigger package for ThyssenKrupp in Alabama. It also underestimates  other awards, including Apple in North Carolina and Boeing in South  Carolina. I also found that it underestimated subsidies to Dell and  Google in North Carolina by omitting the local subsidy portion of the  awards, a problem Ms. Story is aware of, as I noted in my last post.</p>
<p>The <i>Times</i>  series has been great for the spotlight it has put on state and local  subsidies and the sometimes vulgar politics surrounding the process of  awarding them, and for compiling a great database of programs all in one  place. However, its interpretation of the sales tax breaks, which are  5/8 of the national total but largely not subsidies, confuses the issue  of total impact on state and local budgets and makes statistical  analysis premature. This will require some work to fix, but it appears  like most of the raw material is there to do it.</p>

<p>Many types of tech &#8211; <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/12/paul-krugman-changes-his-mind-on.html" target="_blank">not just robots</a> &#8211; have been affecting and are going to affect the service sector.  When someone develops an inexpensive sign you can stick on top of television sets, racks of clothes, or appliances that will change itself whenever someone in the headquarters decides to change the price of the product, its going to eliminate entire departments of people (or move them to doing something else), plus reduce the workload at every retail store in the system.</p>
<p>(The normal cadence for us is to enter prices more than a week before they take effect.  We do have over-rides that allow the process to take place in 24 hours, but the amount of work needed to reduce errors<br />in that process is mind-boggling, not to mention wasteful given it results in hard printing of the wrong signs as well as the right signs.)</p>
<p>As of yet, I&#8217;m not sure automation reduced white collar work.  What it has done is created a race to efficiency.  Now companies scrape competitor data.  They analyze prices to try to determine which generate highest margins.  They analyze floor plans for the same purpose.  I cannot imagine that being done 10 years ago &#8211; both in my previous life as a consultant, and my current life working for a major retailer, we can barely get the data systems to provide the data for those types of analysis properly now.  Ten years ago it would have been impossible anywhere outside the military.  Ten years from now, data pulls that I need an analyst to spend a week and a half doing, and then another week and a half cleaning, will be spit out in minutes (I hope).  That analyst won&#8217;t be pulling data and organizing it &#8211; I&#8217;ll have her doing analysis instead.  Margins will be even tighter because all our competitors will be doing the same analysis, without which nobody survives.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Where the job losses will come from is not that my employer or its competitors will have fewer analysts, because, as I noted, more analysis will be needed just to stay competitive.  Instead, it will come from shuttering some of the companies in the field.  There will be fewer retailers &#8211; and they&#8217;ll all be bigger.</p>

                                <p>In the past discussions at <i>Angry Bear</i> on the impacts automation might have on our lives, and the economics   involved,  gathered comments such as &#8220;You are a neo luddite&#8221;.  As if widespread use of automated systems was automatically good for us overall because we would have access to &#8216;more higher wage and higher skilled jobs&#8217;, cheaper goods, and robots need a work force to maintain them&#8230;of course, there was no offering of numbers of jobs and whether the wage premium for a college education would be maintained.   This is the time to pay more attention as &#8216;insourcing&#8217; gains traction as a buzz word,</p>
<p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/rise-of-the-robots/" target="_blank">Paul Krugman</a> calls for a new look at the economics of robotics and economics :<br />
<blockquote>Catherine Rampell and Nick Wingfield write about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/technology/apple-to-resume-us-manufacturing.html?_r=0&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;adxnnlx=1354969645-6W1egOcP1AYVFCPICjjejA">growing evidence</a> for “reshoring” of manufacturing to the United States. They cite several reasons: rising wages in Asia; lower energy costs here; higher transportation costs. In a <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/07/when-cheap-foreign-labor-gets-less-cheap/?partner=rss&#038;emc=rss">followup piece</a>, however, Rampell cites another factor: robots.<br />…<br />This is an old concern in economics; it’s “capital-biased technological change”, which tends to shift the distribution of income away from workers to the owners of capital.<br />Twenty years ago, when I was writing about globalization and inequality, capital bias didn’t look like a big issue; the major changes in income distribution had been among workers (when you include hedge fund managers and CEOs among the workers), rather than between labor and capital. So the academic literature focused almost exclusively on “skill bias”, supposedly explaining the rising college premium.<br />…</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>If this is the wave of the future, it makes nonsense of just about all the conventional wisdom on reducing inequality. Better education won’t do much to reduce inequality if the big rewards simply go to those with the most assets. Creating an “opportunity society”, or whatever it is the likes of Paul Ryan etc. are selling this week, won’t do much if the most important asset you can have in life is, well, lots of assets inherited from your parents. And so on.<br />I think our eyes have been averted from the capital/labor dimension of inequality, for several reasons. It didn’t seem crucial back in the 1990s, and not enough people (me included!) have looked up to notice that things have changed. It has echoes of old-fashioned Marxism — which shouldn’t be a reason to ignore facts, but too often is. And it has really uncomfortable implications. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But I think we’d better start paying attention to those implications.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hat tip Martin Ford at Econfuture:<br />
<blockquote>The really big deal in the U.S. will be when automation hits the service sector/white collar jobs. Impact on :<a href="http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2012/08/20/china-robotsautomation-and-unemployment/" target="_blank">manufacturing in China might also be very significant</a>.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Watson Pharmaceuticals et al, No. 12-416.  </p>
<p>Via the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/08/business/justices-to-take-up-generic-drug-case.html?emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y&#038;_r=0" target="_blank">New York Times</a> comes this note:</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, for the third time since 2003, the 11th Circuit upheld the agreements as long as the allegedly anticompetitive behavior that results — in this case, keeping the generic drug off the market — is the same thing that would take place if the brand-name company’s patent were upheld. </p>
<p>Two other federal circuit courts, the Second Circuit and the Federal Circuit, have ruled similarly. But in July, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals said that those arrangements were anticompetitive on their face and violated antitrust law. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The agreements are also affected by a peculiar condition in the law that legalized generic competition for prescription drugs. That law, known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, gives a 180-day period of exclusivity to the first generic drug maker to file for approval of a generic copy and to file a lawsuit challenging the brand-name drug’s patent. </p>
<p>Brand-name drug companies have taken advantage of that law, finding that they can settle the patent suit by getting the generic company to agree to stay out of the market for a period of time. Because that generic company also has exclusivity rights, no other generic companies can enter the market. </p></blockquote>

<p> Welfare Spending: Medicare vs Corporate/Business Subsidies (or does the GOP really support WalMart&#8217;s behavior in Bangladesh?)</p>
<p> As most readers know, the federal government is currently in what passes for negotiations between the President&#8217;s Democratic Party Senate and House members and the GOP members that control the House. <br />The Tea Party and its right-wing rhetoric has of course had a radicalizing impact on the GOP positions, with members not only beholden to Grover Norquist and his anti-tax pledge (all strongly supported by various right-wing propaganda tanks like the Tax Foundation, Heritage, American Enterprise, and other organizations) but also to the anti-social welfare corporatists like David and Charles Koch, the Wal-Mart heirs, and other oligarchic families that constitute the top 1% of US income and wealth.  As a result of these two strong influences, the GOP now stands for
<ul>
<li>tax-cuts-no-matter-what (and for tax cuts that benefit the wealthy most of all, as reflected in the rigid position in favor of the &#8220;carried interest&#8221; scam used by private equity profits partners and the extraordinarily preferential rate for capital gains and dividends included in the &#8220;net capital gain&#8221; definition under section 1(h)(11)); and </li>
<li>so-called &#8220;entitlement reforms&#8221;, by which GOPers generally mean reduction in benefits and/or privatization of social welfare programs including Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid.  (All of this is argued in terms of caring about &#8220;saving&#8221; the programs for the future, but the truth lies in the ways that the right proposes changes to the programs&#8211;not changes in costs related to profits taken out by Big Pharma and similar interests, but changes in benefits to ordinary Americans (such as raising the working age for eligibility even though those who work at the hardest labor need benefits earlier, not later, or lowering the cost-of-living-allowance adjustment to benefits for Medicare, even though seniors generally have a HIGHER cost of living because of their increased medical needs, including prescription drugs for diabetes, high blood pressure, and similar diseases particularly prevalent in the elderly population.)</li>
</ul>
<p>The sum of those positions stands for a corporatist philosophy of benefitting the oligarchy and their business enterprises at the expense of everyday Americans who work for a living.</p>

<p>This is even more obvious when one looks at the same groups&#8217; position on government subsidies for business.  The New York Times recently ran an article on this issue, noting that governments typically pay out a lot of money to support profits of companies and receive very little benefit in terms of tax revenues received and jobs created!  Louise Story, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/us/how-local-taxpayers-bankroll-corporations.html">As companies seek tax deals, governments pay high price</a>, New York Times (Dec. 1, 2012).</p>
<p>Over at MauledAgain, one of my fellow tax professors Jim Maule has, like me, long criticized the hypocrisy of supporting tax breaks for private enterprise and opposing earned benefits programs for ordinary citizens and has repeatedly pointed out that the economics of the tax breaks for business don&#8217;t work out for anybody but the owners and managers of the businesses.  They certainly don&#8217;t work for taxpayers of the jurisdiction providing them.  As Jim notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>These tax breaks are nothing more than welfare payments to private enterprise. Opponents of social welfare spending defend these outlays with as much passion as they bring to their attempts to end government assistance for individuals in need of help.James Maule, <a href="http://www.mauledagain.blogspot.com/#9119804729524207183">The Hidden Government Spending Game</a>, MauledAgain (Dec. 5, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>Jim rebuts one of the sham arguments for corporate subsidies&#8211;that they are just &#8220;keeping what belongs to them.&#8221;  Those special subsidies to one private enterprise sector cause ripple effects throughout the economy&#8211;higher taxes to the other taxpayers to make up for the lost revenues, or cuts in important programs that can no longer be sustained without the revenues.  Prices and wages may change as well.  Id.<br />What I want to focus on is the hypocrisy of claiming an interest in ending &#8220;entitlements&#8221; but applying that philosophy only to programs that are intended to help ordinary citizens and not to those intended to beef up the profits of corporations or their managers and owners.  This is especially hypocritical for today&#8217;s right-wing, since they almost universally claim to ascribe to the view that competition is good and that businesses should fail when they cannot successfully compete. </p>
<p>Look at two cases involving WalMart, a multinational enterprise that fights unionization of its employees (and supports right-to-work laws that weaken worker rights) in every way imaginable.</p>
<p>1) In Champlain Illinois (personal experience), <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walmart">WalMart</a> had a huge spralling complex on one side of the road.  It had gotten various tax support for the complex.  It decided to move across the road and down the block into another jurisdiction.  It got new tax subsidies there.  It abandonned the old building and left whatever environmental pollution there.  Who gained?  Mostly WalMart managers and owners.  Not the town and counties.  Not the employees.  Not even the consumers who shopped there, who had to deal with the blight of the abandonned building and the multiplication of vast expanses of ugly parking lots.</p>
<p>2) WalMart in Bangladesh.   WalMart delivers cheap goods because it outsources its clothing and other manufacturing needs to impoverished countries where workers can be paid almost nothing and get almost no protections.  In Bangladesh last month, a clothing factory burned, killing hundreds of workers.  It was a WalMart supplier. See  Natasha Leonard, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/11/26/wal_marts_connection_to_firetrap_bangladesh_factory_is_unclear/">WalMart&#8217;s Connection to Bangladesh Clothing Factory</a>, Salon.com (Nov. 26, 2012), where a critic noted that:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Wal-Mart is supporting, is incentivizing, an industry strategy in Bangladesh: extreme low wages, non-existent regulation, brutal suppression of any attempt by workers to act collectively to improve wages and conditions.&#8221; Id.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>This was a modern-day repeat of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangle_Shirtwaist_Factory_fire">Triangle Shirt Factory</a> incident in the early nineteen hundreds in New York City:  workers unable to escape burned to death in factory rooms without fire exits and yet dangerously littered with lint and other debris that made their workplace a fire hazard.</p>
<p>WalMart, in fact, has led the fight against workers&#8217; rights and spending on safety at that factory and others.  See Natasha Leonard,  <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/12/06/wal_mart_wouldnt_pay_for_bangladeshi_factory_safety_improvements/">WalMart wouldn&#8217;t pay for Bangladeshi factory safety improvements</a>, Salon.com (Dec. 6, 2012). </p></blockquote>
<p>These things are all tied together: hostility to workers rights to bargain collectively for some fair share of the productivity gains that their labor brings about, hostility to workers rights to a safe working place; hostitlity to workers rights to decent health care; hostility to ordinary people&#8217;s rights to a sustainable lifestyle; and hostility to any effort to make the oligarchic uber-rich pay a fair share of the costs of the infrastructure to sustain an economy and a people.</p>
<p>Tax policy, spending policy, policy towards workers, policy towards the wealthy uber-rich&#8211;these are all closely intertwined and must be considered of a piece.  Tax policy needs to establish reasonable levels of contributions based on a progressive income tax that takes into account the marginal utility of the dollar.  Spending policy needs to set priorities based on something other than the lobbying by special corporate and oligarch interests for tax-and-spending provisions that privilege themselves.    Policy towards labor rights and workplace safety need to recognize that the worker is disemplowered within the workplace and needs some legal support to provide a reasonable share of productivity gains&#8211;minimum wage laws, unionization laws, workers safety laws need to protect workers rights against the all-powerful employer.</p>
<p>If the right succeeds in continuing to pass right-to-work laws (Michigan&#8217;s lame duck GOP is trying to do that right now), if the oligarchs succeed in capturing all the profits from workers&#8217; labor&#8211;there will be social unrest on the scale of the Great Depression.  Everybody will suffer from that kind of austerity and class warfare policy.  Broad based economic growth that comes from workers sharing in the profits of their industry and those at the top not getting an unreasonable share of the productivity gains is better for all. </p>

<p>The employment report was better than expected as Sandy apparently did not have the widely expected negative impact.  But the data essentially shows that the recent trend of weak employment continued as payrolls expanded some 146,000 and the household survey showed a -122,00 drop.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WGXTryoy5-M/UMICwHKBcQI/AAAAAAAACWk/CR3E3SxP3xc/s1600/Clipboard01+emp++change.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WGXTryoy5-M/UMICwHKBcQI/AAAAAAAACWk/CR3E3SxP3xc/s320/Clipboard01+emp++change.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>Private payrolls expanded some  147,00 as government employment fell about 1,000.  The expansion of private payrolls  was within the range of recent reports.</p>

<p>The year over year change in both measures &#8212; to smooth out monthly noise &#8212; is still about the same..</p>

<p>The unemployment rate fell to 7.7% , but the drop was due more to -350,000 contraction in the labor  force than higher employment.</p>

<p>The average workweek was stable at 33.4 hours and the index of aggregrate hours worked rose 0.2%.<br />For production or nonsupervisory hours worked expanded 0.4%&#8211; a little better than the total.</p>

<p>Average weekly earnings growth remained very weak at about  1.7%.  This is in sharp contrast to the widespread expectations  that income will spike higher in the 4th quarter as individuals shift income from 2013 back to 2012 to avoid or minimize the expected tax rate increase in 2013.But the hourly wage employees in this report have little or no ability to shift income.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>What would Social Security look like if it met all current law requirements for &#8216;solvency&#8217;? Well unfortunately we have to start with the most eye-glazing opening ever deployed: &#8216;first lets define our terms&#8217;. To which I would add &#8216;within an artificial economic model&#8217;. Because real life is messy, particularly right now, and that introduces unnecessary conceptual confusion. So lets begin.</p>
<p>First assume a solid state economy. For my purposes I will define that as 5.5% unemployment, 5% nominal yield on 10 year Treasuries, 2.5% Real GDP, 2% inflation, 1% annual growth in SS beneficiaries. (Yes in the real world these interact, and maybe this precise combination is unlikely, though each number in isolation is in intermediate ranges, but that will not effect the basic argument).</p>
<p>Second assume that Social Security is currently &#8216;solvent&#8217;, meaning that income from all sources is sufficient to pay all costs, leaving a reserve numerically equal to next year cost. What would it take to keep it &#8216;solvent&#8217;?</p>
<p>Well in our simplified model Social Security cost increases year over year as a sum of inflation growth and beneficiary population. Which ignoring interactions means an increase of 3% per year. Which in turn means that maintaining &#8216;solvency&#8217; requires bringing in enough income from all sources to pay 103% of Year One cost AND add 3% to Trust Fund principal and so leaving the Trust Fund ratio (reserves as a percentage of NEXT year cost) at the end of Year Two at 100 or one year&#8217;s worth of Year Three cost.</p>
<p>Now in our model the 5% nominal yield on Trust Fund assets (mostly invested in a mirror of 5 year bonds) would boost the TF ratio to 105% by interest effects alone, assuming that is that no portion of current interest was needed to pay current cost. Turning that around this means that 2 points of interest are available to reduce the need for &#8216;income excluding interest&#8217; to match cost. Meaning that such income has to total 98% of the new 103% of previous year cost.</p>
<p>Now in year over year terms this has two effects on the overall economy. First &#8216;income excluding interest&#8217; has to increase year over year to pick up its 98% share of the new year&#8217;s new increased cost. And second some part of the 5% interest on Trust Fund assets has to be transferred in cash to pick up its 2% share.</p>
<p>What does this leave us? Well a Social Security system that is cash flow negative each and every year. But with a wrinkle. Since that portion of the 5% nominal interest retained simply to meet the 3% growth in TF balance to maintain a TF ratio of 100 is credited in the form of NEW Special Treasuries, which are NOT financed directly by borrowing, that nominal interest is discounted in cash terms by some 60% from the perspective of the General Fund and the taxpayers who pay into it. AND the system is picking up basic income support for the 1% of the population being added on net to the beneficiary pool.</p>
<p>It seems to me that once having established steady state solvency that people paying taxes on non-wage income are getting a pretty good deal out of Social Security. To the degree that basic income support for seniors, widows/widowers/orphans, the disabled is some societal wide responsibility then 98% is being paid by current wage workers in FICA and by retired workers in tax on benefits and an additional percentage by income tax on wage workers leaving a pretty damn small levy on gains from capital. Forgive the language.</p>
<p>All this of course stems from a condition of &#8216;solvency&#8217;, which translates to keeping the income excluding interest/cost ratio approximating 98%. Which in theory can be done on either the benefit or cost side. But either way the resultant post-solvency is not remotely &#8216;unsustainable&#8217;. Or if so leave some numbers in comments. The only real policy question it seems to me is determining the actual costs and trade-offs getting from where we are now to solvency as defined. And not as is too common now trying to calculate the costs of paying off all the principal going forward. Because as noted in a previous post in a Steady State Social Security system principal NEVER needs to be paid down, instead all of it has to be retained to meet reserve requirements.</p>

<blockquote><div>The fiscal cliff negotiation is no better than a skirmish in what promises to be an epic ten-year struggle to achieve a new fiscal compact. For evidence of that, consider Warren Buffett’s entry into the debate last week, with a suggestion that negotiators seek to bring in revenues at 18.5 percent and cap spending at about 21 percent of GDP.
</p>
</div>
<div>Those were levels that had been sustained over long periods of time in the past, Buffett wrote in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/opinion/buffett-a-minimum-tax-for-the-wealthy.html">op-ed column</a> in <em>The New York Times</em>; they could be reached again relatively quickly.</div>
<div>(Revenues were 15.5 percent of GDP in the fiscal year just ended, while spending was 22.4 percent.) His targets wouldn’t reduce the deficit, he wrote, but they would maintain a stable ratio of debt to output.</div>
<div>
<p>It was the right argument, but Buffett had the wrong numbers. He apparently borrowed them from the <a href="http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/">National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform</a>, led by Erskine Bowes and Alan Simpson, now more than two years old&#8230;</p>

<p><em>Bloomberg Businessweek</em> (November 30, 2012)<br /><a href="http://www.kintera.org/TR.asp?a=dlLYJeNULnJ3LeO2F&#038;s=giKUL4OLKgLQJ2OIItE&#038;m=klIYKfMYKoJ0IkJ" target="_blank">Urging economists to step away from the blackboard</a><br />At 101, Nobel laureate Ronald Coase attempts to launch a journal that focuses on the economic study of firms and people over abstractions and statistics.</p>
