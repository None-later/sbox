<blockquote><p><a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">BLS</a> released its Employment Situation Summary for July. The payroll survey showed an increase in employment of $163 thousand but that unemployment rate rose to 8.3%. So what was the deal from the household survey? Actually the labor force participation rate fell from 63.8% to 63.7% so the small rise in the unemployment rate masks the fact that the employment to population rate fell from 58.6% to 58.4%. The household survey indicates that employment dropped by 195 thousand last month. So I’m sure the political hacks will have lots to debate on this news. But one thing is crystal clear – we are still far below full employment. This Administration and the Federal Reserve need to do a lot more in terms of stimulus. Of course the Republicans are proposing even more fiscal austerity. Go figure! <br /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/03790826995006015721">run75441</a> said&#8230; <br />PGL:       <br />Truly this is not good news. If U# goes up, Particpation Rate increases because people started looking for work again. What you are saying is U3 went up at the same time Participation Rate dropped (more people quit looking).

<p>Social Security works:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2012/end-of-life-financial-study-0803.html">Study: Many Americans die with ‘virtually no financial assets’, by Peter Dizikes, MIT News Office</a>: It is a central worry of many Americans: not having enough money to live comfortably in old age. Now an innovative paper co-authored by an MIT economist shows that a large portion of America’s older population has very little savings in bank accounts, stocks and bonds, and dies “with virtually no financial assets” to their names.</p>
<p>Indeed, about 46 percent of senior citizens in the United States have less than $10,000 in financial assets when they die. Most of these people rely almost totally on Social Security payments as their only formal means of support, according to <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17824">the newly published study</a>, co-authored by James Poterba of MIT, Steven Venti of Dartmouth College, and David A. Wise of Harvard University.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/02/mitt-romney-jobs_n_1734520.html">Jon Ward</a> reports that Glenn Hubbard, Greg Mankiw, and John Taylor joined with Kevin (DOW 36000) Hassett to produce white paper that should be fun reading for us of all:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mitt Romney&#8217;s campaign released a paper by four of its top economic advisers on Thursday to back up its assertion that Romney&#8217;s tax reform and fiscal plan would create &#8220;millions of jobs,&#8221; as an adviser earlier in the day had stated … &#8220;The Romney economic program will change the direction of policy to focus on economic growth,&#8221; the advisers wrote. &#8220;Its pro-growth effects will work in two basic ways: It will speed up the recovery in the short run, and it will create stronger sustainable growth in the long run.&#8221; The paper was less actuarial work with raw data and specific numbers, however, and more of an economic philosophy argument based largely on the premise that simply by undoing much of what President Obama has done since taking office, the economy would recover at a faster pace than it has been from the recession that began in late 2008. &#8220;By changing course away from the policies of the current administration and ending economic uncertainty, as proposed by the Romney plan, we expect that the current recovery will align with the average gains of similar past recoveries,&#8221; the advisers stated. &#8220;History shows that a recovery rooted in policies contained in the Romney plan will create about 12 million jobs in the first term of a Romney presidency.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Past recoveries have relied on monetary expansion. I guess these four have not figured out we currently are in a liquidity trap. The bit about policies that are both good for the short-run and the long-run have been standard talking points from Team Romney for quite a while. To be honest – I still need to read this paper but before I do, let me tick off four such possibilities. </p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>The first two are proposals from the Obama Administration which have been stonewalled by Congressional Republicans: (1) accelerating public investment in infrastructure; and (2) using Federal revenue sharing to insure that state &#038; local governments don’t cut public education. The other two rely on encouraging private investment, which is admittedly still low. We could ask the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates – oh wait, that liquidity trap thing again. Finally, Team Romney is doing its best imitation of Art Laffer saying that tax cuts for high income individuals will somehow encourage investment even as negative real interest rates have not fully succeeded. Isn’t this what the Reagan Administration argued some 30 years ago – which prompted the critique from one of the authors of this white paper that the claim was from “cranks and charlatans”. But let’s also take a read of this white paper and see if there is anything new worth considering.</p></blockquote>

                                <h3>Euro Area Retail Sales Portend Negative Quarter of Real Consumption</h3>
<p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a></p>
<p>Today <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-03082012-AP/EN/4-03082012-AP-EN.PDF">Eurostat released </a>its June estimate of real retail sales for the Euro area. On a month/month basis, real retail sales increased at a rate of 0.1%. However, on a trended basis, the 3-month/3-month average growth rate was down 0.7% in the three months ending in June. Given that the 3-month trended pace of contraction quickened compared to Q1, real consumption is likely to detract from Q2 GDP growth (spending components released on August 23).</p>
<p>On a Y/Y growth basis, there’s a 96% correlation between real retail sales and real private consumption by households and non-profit institutions. Using a simple linear regression, the annual growth rate of consumption should stabilize somewhat in Q2 compared to Q1.<br />\<br /><img alt="" height="362" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/EA_retail_sales_chart.jpg" width="489"></p>
<p>Across the region, real retail sales in Ireland, Estonia, and Germany are the only reported countries to see growth through Q2.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><em>Note: the chart below illustrates the 3-Month/3-Month growth rate through June 2012 (Q2/Q1).</em><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/retail_sales_country.jpg"><img alt="" height="375" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/retail_sales_country.jpg" width="492"></a></p>
<p>On balance, Q2 domestic consumption spending in the Euro area is expected to be buoyed by Germany through June. The problem is, German retail sales growth have just a 38% correlation with real consumption growth, so the bump in retail sales won’t necessarily feed through to consumption at the aggregate level.<br />Euro area real consumption is still contracting. The question then becomes: will the pace of consumption contraction increase or decrease in coming quarters? We’ll have to watch leading indicators such as retail and consumer confidence, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/surveys/documents/2012/bcs_2012_07_en.pdf">both of which deteriorated in July</a>.<br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong><br /><strong><em>Rebecca Wilder</em></strong></p>

                                <p>I just suggested to the Romney campaign that they do an ad highlighting the sheer arrogance of Romney’s “Trust me, and I won’t let you verify” theme, on his personal finances and on the specifics of his “plan” (see my post from yesterday, below) and how, exactly, it could be expected to grow the economy rather than crash it. <br />&#8212;-</p>
<p>UPDATE: Occasionally I update a post of mine by adding all or part of an exchange between a commenter to the post and me when I think the exchange illustrates or adds something important.  The following exchange between a reader named David Michel and me warrants it, I think:</p>
<div>
</div>
<div>DAVID MICHEL: bev, baby even john stuart mocked harry reed on this point. why dont you just go to work for obummer,wait you aredy did!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>ME:  Actually, David, I share Jon Stewart’s dismay and anger about Reid’s statements, partly because the tactic is so obviously appalling, and partly for the reason that your comment highlights: Some people aren’t (or pretend not to be) smart enough to understand the distinction between, on the one hand, whether Romney failed to declare and pay taxes on his overseas bank accounts (especially his Swiss one) until 2009 and then took advantage of the IRS’s new and temporary amnesty program that year to declare the account(s) and pay the taxes with no criminal liability, and (separately) whether he significantly misrepresented the value of the securities he placed in his IRA account in the Cayman Islands (according to numerous experts, the only plausible explanation for how the value of that account [came]* to now be between $20 and $101 million), and, on the other hand, whether instead, Romney paid no taxes at all for 10 years. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Reid’s allegation makes what ACTUALLY happened seem suddenly trivial—which it is not—and draws attention away from [those most] likely possibilities. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Look.  There are only two reasons why Americans use foreign bank accounts in Switzerland, the Cayman Islands and [Bermuda].  One is to avoid or evade paying taxes on the income placed into the accounts and on the interest on the accounts.  The other is to launder illegally-gained money (e.g., drug money).  The chance is really, really small, I’m sure, that Romney’s reason was the latter.  That leaves the former.  Romney says that he saved no money on taxes by maintaining those overseas accounts in those countries, but he does not say, then, why he had and has those accounts there.  Nor does he say how he was able to parley the maximum annual deposits into his IRA account into such a huge amount of money, nor why he chooses to keep his IRA account in the Cayman Islands.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That he and his wife have pronounced the answer to these mysteries none of the public’s business is itself significant, not just because of what it suggests about what those answers are but also what it says about their view of what is and what is not relevant to the public’s [informed decisionmaking] about who should hold the office of the presidency.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>These are serious issues.  I doubt that Romney will make it all the way to November with being asked point-blank by a reporter questions along the lines of those I’ve stated.  But, who knows?

<div>The headline number of a 163,000 increase in payroll employment &#8211;172,000 private and a -9,000  fall in government &#8211;appeared strong.  But it was really just another .weak employment report.  For example over the last twelve months private payroll employment gains have average some 163,000 so this months 172,000 increase was just barely above the 12 month moving average.</div>

<p>The increase in jobs since the recession bottom remains very weak by historic standards, but it is still stronger than in the early 2000s cycle.</p>

<p>But the workweek was unchanged at 34.5 hours.  The manufacturing workweek and over time hours were also unchanged.   Consequently the index of aggregate hours worked for all employees only rose 0.1%,  versus a 0.4% gain last month and a -0..2 drop in the previous month.  Hours worked for production, or nonsupervisory workers only rose 0.1%, the same as in the last two months.  Both measures are now growing slower than the 0.2% average monthly gain established earlier in the cycle.</p>

<p>Average hourly earnings for nonsupervisory workers rose from $19.75 to $19.77.  This is a 1.28% increase over the past year, the smallest annual gain on record.  Weekly earnings are also only up 1.28% over the past year.  The major risk to the economy remains that weak earnings feed into weak consumer spending that feeds back into weak hiring and wages in a downward spiral.</p>

                                <p>by<strong> Dale Coberly</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>Social Security</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong>The Fundamental Truth</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br />If you don’t understand this, you don’t understand Social Security. If you do understand it, all the rest is minor technical detail&#8230; or utter nonsense.</p>
<p>Social Security is not welfare. Social Security is not an investment plan. Social Security is insurance&#8230; to avoid welfare if your investment plan doesn’t work out as well as you hope.</p>
<p>Because of the complexity of the modern economy Social Security is insurance that is needed more often than not. It does what the family used to do under the guidance of “Honor your father and your mother.”<br />But even there you have to understand that while “you” helped out your parents in their old age, they “paid for” that help, first by paying for their own parents in their turn; and second, by paying for you when you were very young; and third, by building the “infrastructure” that made it easier for you when it came your turn to work for a living.</p>
<p>There is nothing about Social Security that guarantees you will always have higher benefits than your parents, or pay lower “taxes.” The world changes. There are fat years and lean years.</p>
<p>What Social Security does do is guarantee that even in the lean years you can “save enough” for your own old age, by the miracle of pay as you go&#8230; paying for your parents old age&#8230; which they paid for in their turn.<br />I hope you can understand the dual nature of “paying for.” It is actually the normal way money works. <br />When you put money in any investment, or Social Security, your money “pays for” whatever the bank or the company you invested in uses it for in that day. What you get is a claim on “your money” when you ask for it back. Some claims are more secure than others.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>You have NO guarantee you will get your money back from a stock. You have some guarantee&#8230; because of government insurance&#8230; that you will get it back from a bank. With Social Security you get the best guarantee so far devised by man&#8230;you get your money back unless you let your elected representatives steal it from you. And because it&#8217;s pay as you go, you get back &#8220;real dollars.&#8221; Inflation is taken care of automatically, and if the economy grows, you get an effective compound interest equal to that growth.<br />Even if the economy declined 50% and we had to live on half of what we earn today, we would still need to set aside about 10% of that in order to have enough to live on when we were too old to work. If you don’t think you can do that, you need to think harder. Half the people in America are already doing it&#8230; living on half what you make and saving for their retirement thanks to Social Security.</p>
<p>In those very bad times that no one is currently predicting, SS would handle it the way societies have handled bad times since the beginning of human societies. We’d all have a little less, and we’d share that with the old folks. </p>
<p>The Trustees currently predict a “worse” economy in which the Social Security benefits would need to be reduced about 25%. It turns out this level of benefits would still be higher on a monthly basis, in “real value,” than today&#8217;s. It also turns out that the reason for the reduction is that future generations are expected to live longer than past generations, so you get that “reduced benefit” for many more months&#8230; adding up to the same thing in the end.</p>
<p>But it also turns out that those future generations, even under the “bad” predictions, will be earning more than twice what we are&#8230; in real dollars. That means they could raise their own payroll tax by two or four percent, keep the present benefit rate&#8230; also about twice the value of today’s in real dollars&#8230; AND have more than twice as much money after paying the tax as they have today.</p>
<p>But that’s the good news. If the economy really did go bad you would still need to save for your retirement. And Social Security is the ONLY way you can do that safe from inflation&#8230; and the bad economy.<br />Instead, what we have today is as if we were on an ocean liner and every time the wind blows from the north, the captain and crew start running around the poop deck screaming, “If this keeps up the ocean will freeze over. We’ve got to lighten ship. Start throwing the passengers overboard. Now.</p>
<p>The Big Liars&#8230; and that seems to include everyone in Washington&#8230; are telling us that we have to cut off our heads today in order to save the cost of dinner twenty years from now.<br />You need to be smarter than that.</p>

<p>Corporations Don&#8217;t Need More Tax Breaks</p>
<p>If you listen to the corporate lobbyists, and the right-wingers who plead their cases for them in Congress and in the media, you&#8217;d think that corporations are so heavily taxed that it is threatening their ability to continue to conduct business and be competitive in world markets. But is that really the case? This blog has often pointed out two obvious shortcomings in the corporate whine: first, the corporate statutory rate of 35% is honored in the breach&#8211;most corporations pay actual tax rates so significantly lower than 35% that the statutory rate is an illusion; and second, as far as global competitiveness is concerned, the corporate tax rate is the only significant tax that US corporations pay, whereas most other countries have both corporate income taxes and VAT taxes, often paid at each transactional stage of production.</p>
<p>A site called &#8220;NerdWallet&#8221; provides considerable information based on analysis of the financial statements of companies, providing greater transparency for investors and, lucky for us, for those of us interested in tax facts.   See, e.g., the NerdWallet study, <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/corporate-taxes-only-9-percent/">Top Companies Paid 9% Tax Rate </a>(July 24, 2012).<br />
<blockquote>Because tax provision includes both domestic and foreign, current and deferred taxes, NerdWallet researched further to find how much was actually paid by these American companies to the U.S. federal government in the most recent tax year.  By dividing the current portion of federal taxes by pre-tax income, NerdWallet was able to calculate the percentage of these companies’ earnings that was paid to the U.S. government. <strong>For the ten American companies with highest earnings in the most recent fiscal year, this number averaged 9%. NerdWallet Study (emphasis added).</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A press release about the study notes just how much corporate taxation has shrunk as a source of revenue in the US, as corporations pay lower rates than ordinary Americans.<br />
<blockquote>A new <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/corporate-taxes-only-9-percent/">NerdWallet study</a> found the 10 most profitable U.S. companies paid an average of just 9% in federal taxes last year. These low rates are particularly shocking given that the official tax rate is 35%. The study also revealed that more than half of the 500 largest U.S. companies <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/individual-vs-corporate-taxes/">paid a lower tax rate</a> than the average American.  NerdWallet press release (July 30 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>NerdWallet also has a very useful tool for seeing what each major corporation of the top 500 actually pays in taxes, available <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/markets/corporate-taxes/general-electric-co">here</a>. You can scroll through a list of corporations to select a particular one of interest, and the tool will show the actual rate of taxes paid to the U.S. government, the compensation paid to the CEO, and the average compensation for the company&#8217;s employees, as well as the multiple of the CEO compensation to the average employee compensation. For example, the tool provides the following information for several of the largest of the 500 corporations.<br />
<blockquote>1. Exxon Mobil Pre-tax Earnings: $73.3 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $1.5 Billion (2%)<br />2. Chevron Pre-tax Earnings: $46.6 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $1.9 Billion (4%)<br />3. Apple Pre-tax Earnings: $34.2 Billion Actual Taxes Paid $3.9 Billion (11%)<br />4. Microsoft Pre-tax Earnings: $28.1 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $3.1 Billion (11%)<br />5. JPMorgan Chase &#038; Co Pre-tax Earnings: $26.7 Billion Actual Taxes Paid $3.7 Billion (14%)</p></blockquote>

                                <p>
<div>Romney released a new middle class economic plan [today].  [The] plan is called: “Mitt Romney’s new plan for a stronger middle class.” It contains ideas we’ve heard before: more access to domestic energy resources; cutting taxes and capping spending; repealing Obamacare.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Mark Hopkins at Moody’s Analytics tells me that it is mostly a set of assertions about <i>outcomes</i> Romney wants, rather than a set of policies on how to achieve them.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“There aren’t enough specifics here to evaluate the plan,” Hopkins said. “It’s not clear in most cases what specific policies underlie the assertions of outcomes he wants.”
</p>
</div>
<div>&#8212; Greg Sargent, Washington Post, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/the-obama-campaigns-real-game-plan/2012/08/02/gJQA2vC8RX_blog.html?hpid=z2">today</a>
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Indeed.  Hopefully Obama and more members of the media will point out the distinction between a stated <i>plan</i> and a mere statement of claimed outcomes of an unspecified plan.  Romney and his wife say that the public has all the information it “needs” about his finances in order to take his word for it that his finances have all been on the up-and-up, and he makes essentially the same claim about his planned economic policies: All the public needs to know is, Romney says so.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>Which in a way is true—if you get my point.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the Middle Class, Stupid! (Review)</p>
<p>When I saw that James Carville and Stan Greenberg had just published <i>It&#8217;s the Middle Class, Stupid!</i> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Middle-Class-Stupid-James-Carville/dp/0399160396">Blue Rider Press</a>), I knew that I would want to read it. I had always liked Carville&#8217;s <i>We&#8217;re Right, They&#8217;re Wrong</i> and wanted to know his take on approaching the declining fortunes of the middle class.<br />    <br />While this book includes some diagnosis of the problems and has a very detailed and very good set of policy proposals, primarily it is a work on political strategy. Based on polling and focus groups the authors have conducted over the last several years (as well as their long experience running campaigns and polling), Carville and Greenberg analyze what they consider some of the political failures of the Obama Administration, particularly with regards to messaging.<br />     <br />For example, they argue that Americans are not persuaded by Team Obama&#8217;s continuing emphasis on the fact that the President inherited a mess from the Bush Administration (Chapter 11). Although voters place much of the blame for the Great Recession on President Bush, Greenberg reports that his focus groups reacted very negatively to President Obama&#8217;s car-in-the-ditch metaphor (&#8220;I&#8217;m still in the ditch!&#8221; many told Greenberg) and the participants expressed strong opinions that we needed to look forward, not backward.    </p>
<p>As one said, &#8220;[Obama] is trying to say things are turning around, but the numbers are still bad.&#8221; The premature declaration of victory by the Administration described here has been strongly criticized by <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/was-failure-inevitable/">Paul Krugman</a>, among others. Economically effective policy is the best talking point. Carville and Greenberg also give a compelling litany of sophisticated responses to even &#8220;good&#8221; job creation news on pp. 103-7.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The second big, non-obvious, point is that Americans really are concerned about the deficit and debt (Chapter 8). Again, even though they recognize the role of the Bush tax cuts and unfunded wars in creating that debt, they are still leery about the possibility of spending our way to more economic growth, though not by huge majorities. Too many of them are convinced of the false analogy between households and governments, although Paul Krugman is doing his best to convince them with his new book, <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-393-08877-9/"><i>End This Depression Now!</i></a> The framing the authors found most persuasive to middle class voters was an emphasis on &#8220;investments that will get our country back on track.&#8221; Tellingly, as Carville and Greenberg note, their respondents did not see the debt as a reason to cut Social Security or Medicare.<br />    <br />Third, but more obvious, middle class voters don&#8217;t see government as the solution because they consider it to be captured by elite interests. The focus groups showed that this view led to some tendency to paralysis and disengagement from politics. It is from this point that Carville and Greenberg pivot to their most important policy recommendation: Amend the Constitution or obtain a Supreme Court that will overturn <i>Citizens United</i> and end corporate personhood. In addition, they call for public financing of elections, disclosure of campaign contributions, requiring broadcasters to cut the price of political ads, and ending the revolving door of office holders and lobbyists. All this is in support of a politics that makes rebuilding the middle class Job 1 for government, and for a consistent framing of all issues (including foreign policy) in terms of their impact on the middle class.<br />    <br />Not everything in the book is persuasive. At one point Greenberg says the popularity of raising taxes on the rich &#8220;is as close to an absolute truth you can have in polling&#8221; (p. 144). I have two problems with this. First, you could say the same thing for other industrialized democracies. <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Taxation_and_Democracy.html?id=gAML_smYeHIC">Sven Steinmo</a>, writing in the early 1990s, has cited polling results for the U.S., U.K., and Sweden, all of which showed publics that thought the rich should pay more taxes, yet in none of these cases has that been the direction of policy over the last 30 years. To me, this suggests there is an international dimension that helped make government capture possible, but the book does not address globalization very much at all.<br />    <br />Second, the book devotes relatively little attention to another issue that also is overwhelmingly supported in <a href="http://nelpaction.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/bloomberg-calls-to-raise-new-yorks-minimum-wage-reaffirming-political-economic-popularity-of-wage-increase/">poll after poll</a>: raising the minimum wage. Yes, making work pay is an important theme in the book and the authors acknowledge that increasing the minimum wage is part of that, but they say nothing about how putting the issue on many state ballots helped increase Democratic turnout in 2006. In Missouri, for example, the minimum wage <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Missouri_Minimum_Wage_Act,_Proposition_B_%282006%29">Proposition B passed by a 76-24 margin</a>, helping Claire McCaskill squeak out a U.S. Senate win with less than 50% of the vote.<br />    <br />The other weakness of the book is that the authors are too close to President Clinton to give a completely objective view of his Presidency. While they make a single parenthetical reference about how NAFTA may not have been such a great idea for the middle class after all, they say nothing about how &#8220;ending welfare as we know it&#8221; was bad for the middle class. This can best be seen by thinking about income determination as a massive bargaining situation. Anything that takes away one side&#8217;s options reduces its bargaining power, and the 1996 welfare reform did just that. In addition, they seem blind to the fact that income inequality (top 1% vs. the 20th-80th percentiles) took off during the Clinton Administration far in excess of what had been seen under President Reagan, as a glance at their chart on p. 52 shows.<br />    <br />Finally, the book has no index, which is very annoying when you have 296 pages of text and 25 pages of endnotes.<br />    <br />Those caveats aside, this is a very good book that deserves a careful reading by progressive activists. I certainly learned something from it, and I&#8217;m sure you will, too.</p>
