                                <p>I can&#8217;t help but compare <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/08/quelle-surprise-sec-plans-to-make-the-world-safer-for-fraudsters-push-through-jobs-act-con-artist-friendly-solicitation-rules.html" target="_blank">Yves Smith&#8217;s appraisal</a> of SEC performance and either party&#8217;s political attitude to the previous post by <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/08/is-that-it-for-financial-crisis-cases_18.html">Peter Henning</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you merely looked at the SEC’s record on enforcement, you’d conclude that  it suffered from a Keystone Kops-like inability to get out of its own way. The  question remains whether that outcome is the result of unmotivated leadership  (ex in the safe realm of insider trading cases) and long-term budget starvation  leading to serious skills atrophy, or whether the SEC really, truly, is so  deeply intellectually captured by the financial services industry that it thinks  industry members don’t engage in fraud, they only make “mistakes”?</p>
<p>It’s sure looking like the latter. We’ve railed repeatedly on the refusal of  the SEC to use an obvious tool, Sarbanes Oxley, to pursue not only the massive  failings of these firms to install adequate risk controls during the crisis, but  also to go after obvious recent cases, namely, the JP Morgan CIO losses and the  MF Global collapse.</p>
<p>Further confirmation comes today in the form of investor abuse and  repudiation of Dodd Frank requirements that the SEC hopes to slip next week when  hopefully no one will notice. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/standard-chartered-plc/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Standard Chartered</a>, the British bank, has agreed to pay New York’s top banking regulator $340 million to settle claims that it laundered hundreds of billions of dollars in tainted money for Iran and lied to regulators.<br />(Dan here&#8230;We do not know how much remained with Standard Charter as various kinds of fees, admin., and charges…was there a premium for risk?)<br />…it falls near the middle of the collective settlements that the Justice Department and the Manhattan district attorney have reached with other global banks in recent years over money laundering charges, from $619 million with ING bank in June to $298 million with Barclays in 2010. </p></blockquote>
<p>For a bit of speculation directly from the article with no special knowledge, let&#8217;s  comparison shop for human consumption and readers:</p>
<p>($345,000,000 /  $250,000,000,000 =  .00138 = one tenth and a bit of a percent) and to compare to a more human scale,  if you handled $100,000 for ten years in business it would be $1,000,000 times .00138 = <strong>$1,380  fine.  Not a hard thing to pay.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> Another way to think of it is:   If you made 10% (Who knows?) of 250 billion as retained in some way in costs (salaries, bonuses, use of facilities risk premiums and such) that is 25 billion, so the fine might be ten times a % of money made billable at 2.5 billion/year, and a fine of 1.38 %, means a <strong>$345,000,000 fine</strong> out of $2,500,000,000 billable for the year.  A special tax rate of 1.38% for one year for risks over a decade is pretty good, no?</p>
<p>What am I missing?</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;Democrats should be worried, because Romney and Ryan have the better debating position. Their position is simple and superficially compelling: Government is bad. (Cf. the DMV—it’s state, not federal, and the one in Massachusetts works very well, but whatever; BATF; EPA; IRS; whatever agency your audience happens to dislike. Compare to Apple as if all private sector businesses were like Apple.) Government infringes on individual liberty. Cut down the government and we will have (a) more liberty, (b) more economic growth, and (c) lower taxes.</p>
<p>What do the Democrats say in response? Government is good at some things and bad at some things, and needs to be leaner and more efficient. Or people need government services to succeed. (Doesn’t that sound offensive as soon as you say it, even if it’s true?) Or there’s a moral obligation to redistribute income through the tax-and-transfer system. Or government isn’t really that big when you compare it to history. So taxes should go down for some people and up for some other people.</p></blockquote>

                                <div>Peter J. Henning, a colleague of Linda Beale, poses the question in the NYT:</div>
<p><a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/08/13/is-that-it-for-financial-crisis-cases/?nl=business&#038;emc=edit_dlbkpm_20120813%22%3EIs%20That%20It%20for%20Financial%20Crisis%20Cases?">Is That It for Financial Crisis Cases?</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Last week turned out to be a good one for <a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=GS&#038;inline=nyt-org">Goldman Sachs</a>. The Justice Department closed a criminal investigation of the firm and its chief executive, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/lloyd_c_blankfein/index.html?inline=nyt-per">Lloyd C. Blankfein</a>, and the firm disclosed that the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/securities_and_exchange_commission/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Securities and Exchange Commission</a> had decided not to pursue a civil fraud case related to a subprime mortgage deal.<br />When the story of the financial crisis is finally written, this may turn out to be the denouement of the government’s investigations of Wall Street for potential wrongdoing that contributed to the financial crisis in 2008.<br />…<br />Investment banks like Goldman load their disclosure documents with plenty of generic disclaimers that can support a defense that no one sought to mislead buyers. It may not be so much a matter of weak laws as the requirement to show beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had the intent to commit a crime, a significant barrier to successfully prosecuting any fraud case.<br />And proving a perjury case is even more difficult because it must be shown that the defendant intentionally lied, not just that the testimony was incomplete or inaccurate. Whether Goldman’s position was “massive” or not looks to be a matter of degree, making it almost impossible to prove perjury.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The S.E.C.’s decision was a bit more surprising because the enforcement division told Goldman in February that it planned to recommend civil charges against the firm related to its sale of a $1.3 billion mortgage-backed security. Goldman had already settled allegations in 2010 about how it structured a <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/collateralized-debt-obligations/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">collateralized debt obligation</a> known as Abacus, so even if the S.E.C. had pursued another case, it was unlikely to contain any major new revelations about systemic misconduct.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>…<br />It does not look as if any other criminal cases against other banks are likely to emerge from the financial crisis now that four years have gone by. The Justice Department has already passed on cases against executives from firms like <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/countrywide_financial_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Countrywide Financial</a>and the <a href="http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=AIG&#038;inline=nyt-org">American International Group</a>, and nothing else seems to be drawing the attention of prosecutors at this point.<br />…<br />New laws would not make it any more likely that senior executives could be pursued unless they included liability as a “responsible corporate officer” for the conduct of underlings without having to prove an executive’s knowledge or recklessness.<br />Wall Street would be sure to put up quite a fight if expansive criminal prohibitions were introduced that made it easier to prosecute senior managers for the violations of lower-level employees. The pushback in Congress against the Dodd-Frank Act’s regulation of the financial sector shows that there may not be much appetite for additional government involvement in the financial sector.</p></blockquote>

                                <div>In poker a “tell” is the physical giveaway or tic that lets you know someone is lying about his or her hand. In politics it’s the mode of evasion a politician chooses to sidestep a truth he or she doesn’t want to admit or to avoid saying something against self-interest. In his debut interview with <a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-news-brit-hume-praised-on-msnbc-for-exposing-paul-ryans-medicare-lie/">Fox News’ Brit Hume</a> Tuesday, Rep. Paul Ryan’s “tells” were audacious and revealing. They suggest an opening Democrats would be wise to pursue.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ryan (R-Wis.) tried to cloak himself in his supposedly charming “wonky-ness” to sidestep two simple questions from Hume: When does Mitt Romney’s budget reach balance, and when does Ryan’s own budget plan do the same? Ryan pirouetted because Hume’s queries threatened to expose his famed “fiscal conservatism” as a fraud.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It’s worth parsing Ryan’s tactics in this exchange because it shows the brand of disingenuousness we’re dealing with. So let’s go to the videotape. Have a look at the relevant two-minute portion of the clip (<a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/15/politics/ryan-budget/index.html">excerpted on this CNN video</a>) and then we’ll dissect it.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Okay, you’re back. Hume started with <a data-xslt="_http" href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/1785458730001/paul-ryan-on-medicare-budget-plan-relationship-with-romney">a simple question</a>: “The budget plan that you’re now supporting would get to balance when?”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, for context, recall that in the last era of epic budget smackdowns, 1995 and 1996, Newt Gingrich would have had an equally simple answer: in seven years. President Bill Clinton’s failure to embrace the goal of a balanced budget at all was a major political liability that Clinton finally (and shrewdly) erased when he came out with his own 10-year plan in mid-1995. (It’s worth underscoring that a 10-year path to balance was viewed then as the outer limit of credibility — pledging to end the red ink any further than a decade out didn’t pass the laugh test.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Since Ryan knows that Romney’s bare sketch of a plan never reaches balance, he stumbles momentarily before trying to move the conversation to his comfortable talking points about Romney’s goal of reducing spending to historic norms as a share of gross domestic product.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Hume grows quietly impatient. He practically cuts Ryan off.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“I get that,” Hume says. “But what about balance?”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>You can see Ryan flinch. He doesn’t know, he says. Why not? “I don’t want to get wonky on you,” he says, recovering, “because we haven’t run the numbers on that specific plan.” But that’s not “getting wonky” at all. As common sense (and the Gingrich/Clinton approach) suggests, there’s nothing arcane about this subject. You decide on a sensible path to balance as a goal and come up with policies that achieve it. All this means is that Romney hasn’t done what a fiscally conservative leader would do. Trying to evade this as a matter of not “getting wonky” is Ryan’s tell. He’s betting Hume is too dumb, uninterested or short on time to press the point.

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Wow.  Okay.  That’s a much longer excerpt from someone else’s piece than I like to use, unbroken by my own commentary.  And it doesn’t even include the real <i>coup de grace</i> of that column, the best I’ve read in a really long time.  The column goes on recite further details of that interview:  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Your own budget . . . when does that contemplate reaching balance?” Hume asks.
</p>
</div>
<div>There’s no exit. Not until the 2030s, Ryan finally admits, looking uncomfortable — but then he quickly adds, making a face, that’s only under the Congressional Budget Office’s scoring rules, implying that they’re silly constraints every Fox News viewer would agree are ridiculous (instead of sensible rules meant to credit politicians only for policy proposals that are real). Ryan adds that “we believe” if we get the economy growing, “it would balance in 10 years.” But that’s supply-side faith-based budgeting again — exactly what we ran an empirical test on in the 1980s. (And the truth is, if Ryan’s big tax cuts were properly accounted for, his plan’s real date of balance would push well beyond 2040).
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And finally that promised <i>coup de grace</i>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Why am I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-the-talented-mr-ryan/2012/08/12/1afaaaa2-e4ad-11e1-936a-b801f1abab19_story.html">harping</a> on this? Because it’s impossible to overstate how central the unjustified label of “fiscal conservative” is to the Ryan brand and the GOP’s strategy. As Clinton understood in the 1990s, “fiscal responsibility” is a values issue important to the voters who decide modern presidential elections.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The point: Democrats can’t afford to let Ryan/Romney’s phony image as superior fiscal stewards survive. And Hume’s interview shows how swiftly this charade can be exposed if Democrats and the press zero in on simple questions like Hume’s. If the press is primed to cover this more intelligently, such queries will also expose the big Republican lie — the idea that you can balance the budget as the baby boomers age without taxes rising.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let me be clear. The most important issue facing the country isn’t when we’re going to balance the budget. It’s how to get growth and jobs reignited in the near term and how to renew the country’s promise and competitiveness after that (an agenda in which long-term budget sanity is just the ante). But if Democrats spend all their energy on Medicare — and don’t knock out the GOP ticket’s undeserved reputation for fiscal responsibility — they’ll find themselves in unexpected peril as the race heads to the fall.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/08/individualism-vs-collectivism-thanks.html">a lengthypost I wrote on Wednesday</a> I expressed my own fear of the danger to Obama and the other Democrats of an all-Medicare-all-the-time campaign focus, because it removes the emphasis on the dramatic income tax reductions for the wealthy and therefore on the radical reduction of tax revenue—which, among other things, <i>surely would require a substantial reduction in Medicare benefits to current and imminent beneficiaries, despite Romney/Ryan’s protestations to the contrary</i>. Here’s how I ended that Wednesday post:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>A lot of eyebrows were raised on Sunday when Ryan, sitting next to Romney in an interview, told Bob Schieffer that he wants to end the tax breaks that apply only to the wealthy.  That’s nice, but of no effect.  A seminal part of his tax-and-budget plan, passed this year by the House, is the elimination of <i>all</i> income taxes on capital gains and dividends.  And although this would mean that many very wealthy people will pay no income taxes or estate taxes, and many other very wealthy people would pay income taxes at a single-digit rate, the elimination of these taxes would apply as well to the non-wealthy who have a capital gain or receive stock dividends, however small.  And so—voila!—Ryan’s statement, made with such earnestness, does not apply to the issue of taxes on capital gains and dividends.  Nor, for that matter, to estate taxes, which his plan entirely eliminates; some non-wealthy people leave small estates, after all.  And semantics is the name of their game, the objective of which is the enabling of ever more vast accumulations of wealth, utterly unfettered by tax obligations.  Pure and simple.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My big fear about the all-Medicare-all-the-time campaign that began last weekend with Romney’s Ryan announcement is that it allows Romney and Ryan to claim the mantle of straight talkers about what they warn is a Medicare-caused fiscal calamity that awaits.  They have yet to explain why, if they fear such a calamity, they propose to reduce federal revenue by trillions of dollars, through their tax-elimination-on-the-wealthy plan.  And when they stress, as they do again and again, that their destroy-Medicare-in-order-to-save-it plan will not end the current program for its current or relatively-imminent recipients (those who are 55 or older), maybe they’ll deign to reveal what programs will be eliminated in order to pay for Medicare for current recipients and baby boomers <i>and</i>—<i>and</i>—the trillions-of-dollars tax cuts for the wealthy.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My suggestion: Hurricane disaster relief for the southern Atlantic and Gulf Coast states, which will vote for this ticket <i>en force</i>, and crop insurance and drought disaster relief for the plains states, which will vote for them and their budget plan in almost as large percentages. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In 2005, Ryan now-famously advised his audience when he addressed an Ayn Rand fan club that they should make no mistake: current politics is a clash between “individualism” and “collectivism.”  And indeed it is.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, let’s ensure that the public knows the specifics.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>After all, for all the indignant denials Romney has made about Harry Reid’s allegation that Romney paid no income taxes for a period of at least 10 consecutive years, Ryan’s plan—the plan being the one that Romney adopted all the way back last winter, during the primary season; the drafter being the person whom Romney has chosen to be a heartbeat away from the actual presidency has made —would enable Romney to openly pay no taxes on most of his income for the next ten years and beyond.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And about Medicare anyway: Isn&#8217;t it a collectivist program?
</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE: Turns out, I’m <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/15/1120420/-Paul-Ryan-admits-We-haven-t-run-the-numbers-on-Romney-Ryan-budget-plan-but-trust-him-it-s-great">very late</a> to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/16/1120893/-That-wonky-whacky-Ryan">this party</a>.  How could this not have gotten <i>a lot</i> of media attention earlier?

<div>&#8230; And when, exactly, <i>did </i>he pay that at-least-13% per year?  Might some of it have been paid under the 2009 IRS amnesty plan for people who’d been hiding money in secret overseas bank accounts, after the Swiss banks suddenly agreed to reveal to the IRS the identities of American account holders?

<div>Sooo, Governor, about those <i>massive</i> tax cuts for the wealthy ….  You know, including the elimination of all incomes taxes on capital gains and stock dividends, which your running mate’s budget proposal includes?  <i>How</i>, exactly, do you plan to balance the budget despite that loss of revenue?
</p>

<div></div>
<div>No, no, no.  I mean, how, <i>exactly</i>, do you plan to do that?

                                <p>I associate the phrase &#8220;unconventional monetary policy&#8221; with Joe Gagnon.  Here we were in 2008 with the conventional monetary instrument &#8212; the target Federal Funds rate &#8212; pedal to the metal and the economy stalling.   Many people said it was time for fiscal stimulus (I think Gagnon agreed).  He also suggested unconventional monetary policy, by which he really meant unconventional policy by the Fed, since the point wasn&#8217;t changing the money supply but rather changing demand for other assets.  The Fed can create Fed liabilities (high powered money) and buy some assets driving up their prices.  To Gagnon the point was the assets side of the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet.  His proposal was to buy a whole whole lot ($5 trillion worth).  That isn&#8217;t going to happen, so his new proposal is to buy assets which the Fed can buy which are perceived to be risky and are not close substitutes for money, that is Federal Agency issued mortgage bonds.</p>
<p>Oddly he is, as far as I can tell, the only advocate of unconventional monetary policy who focuses on which assets the Fed should buy (I don&#8217;t count myself and Brad DeLong occasionally sounds like Gagnon).  Some other economists (I am thinking of Duncan Black) propose that the Fed ignore the Federal Reserve act and do things which it is clearly not allowed to do.  Many more discuss unconventional monetary policy exactly as if it were conventional monetary policy.  </p>
<p>Why ?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I will explain then much later provide evidence.  It is agreed by all salt water economists that the Fed can normally stimulate demand in the short run by causing a price level higher than the one expected with sticky wages and prices were set.  For decades the key issue in the debate has been the problem of subgame non perfection which was renamed dynamic inconsistency (forcing those of us interested in dynamic inconsistency to call it time inconsistency so then they decided to call subgame non perfection time inconsistency).  The problem is that if price and wages setters know the monetary authority will try to cause a price level higher than the expected one, then the only subgame perfect equilibrium has socially costly inflation.  So the discussion became all about pre-commitment and credibility and expectations and such.  This always under the assumption that the Fed can get the price level it wants.</p>
<p>None of this has much to do with the current problem.  Ben Bernanke has been saying he wants higher demand for years now.  He&#8217;s practically been begging Congress for help.  In 2010 and 2011, the FOMC made huge mega gigantic efforts to stimulate the economy and nothing much happened.  Yet most salt water economists insist the the problem is that the FOMC has not decided to stimulate or has not communicated that intention.  </p>
<p>Some people are extreme and discuss the problem under the assumption that there is no difference between monetary policy with a Federal Funds rate of essentially zero and one with a rate of 10%.  They are very silly people and will not be named here.</p>
<p>Others are listed (with endorsement) by Brad DeLong (see above as the only semin Gagnonian I can think of) <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/08/a-half-written-platonic-dialogue-on-what-the-federal-reserve-is-doing-or-not-doing-right-now.html#comment-6a00e551f080038834017617446c6e970c">here</a> </p>
<p> Jan Hatzius&#8217;s proposals that the Fed buy $50 billion of long-term bonds a week until expectations of prices and of nominal spending return to their pre-2008 growth path. They are the ones who ought to be adopting Christina Romer&#8217;s proposals for price-level targeting. They are the ones who ought to be adopting Olivier Blanchard&#8217;s proposals for a long-run inflation target of 3+%/year rather than 2-%/year. They are the ones who ought to be adopting Joe Gagnon&#8217;s proposals for&#8211;since the FHFA won&#8217;t do its job and rebalance housing finance&#8211;the Federal Reserve to fund vehicles to deal with the underwater-borrower problems that beset our mortgage and housing markets and are holding back recovery.</p>
<p>(the odd grammar is because he is saying that Bernanke et al should be adopting these proposals).</p>
<p>Which one here is not like the others ?  Which one has a plan which will work even if it doesn&#8217;t affect the expectations of most economic agents ?  Which plan works through supply and demand and the assumption that if some things (RMBS) have higher prices then people will produce more of them ?  </p>
<p>I think the reason that Gagnon proposes a direct approach which does not work through the credibility of targeted expectational shifts of policy regimes is that he isn&#8217;t pathetically addicted to the decades of research which happen not to be very relevant at the moment.</p>
<p>The reliance of the others on the expected inflation imp (first cousin of the confidence fairy) is not due to the fact that only that imp can save us now.  It is just because they have been its votaries for too long to see that static supply and demand curves can tell us what the Fed needs to know now.</p>

<p>Romney&#8217;s Private Equity Magic Trick&#8211;equity manager&#8217;s gain, taxpayers&#8217; losses (Reich Video)</p>
<p>Mitt Romney claims that his business experience at Bain Capital is a superb qualification for the presidency.  He implies that this experience will carry over to his economic policies, with the suggestion that he will become a &#8220;job creator-in-chief&#8221; like all those one-percenters purportedly are in the private sector.<br />In reality, private equity experience is a recipe for disaster in the White House.  Think about what private equity firms do.  They take an ongoing business&#8211;usually one that is making decent profits and paying its workers decently&#8211;and they make it into one that can pay outsized &#8220;rent&#8221; profits to the private equity firm.  Usually, though not always, this means cutting costs and adding debt. </p>
<p>The debt is an elixir for private equity firms.  Because interest is deductible, it actually increases profits by lowering the company&#8217;s federal income taxes; yet because it isn&#8217;t required to be used by the firm to actually improve the products or services offered, it is often used instead to pay dividends to the private equity firms, paying off whatever actual investment the private equity firm made in the company. </p>
<p>Cutting costs is the way for private equity firms to extract even more gravy from their target company.  Cost cutting is most often directed at</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>firing workers and making fewer workers do the same work that more workers used to do (that&#8217;s called a &#8220;productivity&#8221; gain, garnered, of course, by the private equity firm and not by the everyday workers), and/or </li>
<li>outsourcing jobs to other countries so that labor can be paid less than a going wage in this country (that&#8217;s often coupled with step one, since workers are no longer needed in this country&#8211;sometimes the US workers are even required to train their cheaper foreign counterparts before they are let go, and of course those &#8220;effiencicy&#8221; gains are garnered by the private equity firm and not by the remaining workers), and/or </li>
<li>cutting wages and benefits for the remaining workers (and shipping those extra &#8220;savings&#8221; out as dividends to the equity firm investors), and/or </li>
<li>innovating better administrative systems (this can be a good deal&#8211;for example, putting money  that the company didn&#8217;t have until the new &#8220;investors&#8221; came in into digital record systems or improved communications systems, but it can also be a bad deal, if the firm uses its new technology to game the federal system on taxes, or Medicare reimbursements, or federal contracting or similar items)
<ul>
<li>Consider the fact that Bain and other private equity firms purchased a for-profit hospital.  One of the &#8220;improvements was to redesign the coding system for patient services to increase the reimbursements from Medicare and thus hike up the hospital system&#8217;s profits, which are garnered by the private equity firm.  Julie Creswell and Reed Adelson, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/business/hca-giant-hospital-chain-creates-a-windfall-for-private-equity.html">A Giant Hospital Chain is Blazing a Profit Trail</a>, New York Times (Aug. 15, 2012), at A1 (noting that Medicare reimbursements for the highest classifications surged to $949,000 in 2010 from $48,000 in 2006 at one hospital, in a story about Bain Capital and other equity firms&#8217;  profit improvements at HCA, where nurses and doctors express concerns about profit-making that is driving decisions that shortchange patients through understaffing and/or shortchange the government, as in the new coding system that caused the Medicare reimbursements to skyrocket); see also Steve Denning,<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2012/08/15/private-equity-wont-fix-health-care-either/">HCA: The unsustainable private equity bubble in US health care</a>, Forbes (Aug. 15, 2012). </li>
<li>As one commenter on the NY Times article noted, &#8220;To be more profitable as a healthcare facility requires &#8230; having more sick people to treat, or hav[ing] higher charges.  Both are inhumane.&#8221;  Munz, New York, NY.  And as one former HCA employee commented, &#8220;patient safety and medication safety came in a distant 2nd to conformity and [the] draconian measures to make care more efficient.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These kinds of activities go hand in hand with the increasing consolidation into mega-business enterprises (regrettably aided by the tax code&#8217;s &#8220;tax-free reorganization&#8221; provisions, that were also made much more flexible during the Bush years in order to facilitate such consolidations).  Big businesses reap the productivity gains of their workers for the few managers and significant shareholders at the top, and either buy  or compete with local and family-owned small enterprises to put those smaller and shallower-pocketed (and less well-connected) business out of the way, thus separating more and more businesses from the communities in which they are located.  All in all, not good for America, and not the kind of skills one wants in the presidency, where we need someone who can see the relationship between the stability of small businesses, viable communities, and stable workers.</p>
