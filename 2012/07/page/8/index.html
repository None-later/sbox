<p>Tax Foundation Misses the Ball (again) in its analysis of Supreme Court Health Care Ruling</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/">Tax Foundation</a> pretends to be non-partisan.  Of course we all know that is pretense.  Look at the way it has pushed its concept of the so-called &#8220;tax freedom day&#8221;, which misleads everyday Americans into thinking that they are working for months and months to pay taxes, based on the use of &#8220;average&#8221; tax burdens across every American from Bill Gates to Joe Unemployed and a good deal of uncertainty about just who pays what taxes (like the corporate taxes).</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve done it again in their analysis of the health care decision.  See Richard Morrison and Joseph Henchman, Tax Foundation, <a href="http://www.heraldnews.com/newsnow/x1660542461/GUEST-OPINION-The-tax-flaw-in-health-care-ruling">Guest Opinion, The Tax Flaw in Health Care Ruling</a>, The Hearld News (July 3, 2012).</p>
<p>1.  The Tax Foundation builds its conclusion into its description of the givens.<br />They start out with their conclusion&#8211;a definition of taxes as items whose intent is &#8220;raising revenue for government spending&#8221; and of a &#8220;penalty&#8221; as &#8220;imposed for the purpose of punishing an individual for an unlawful act.&#8221;  Based on that conclusory definition, they conclude unsurprisingly that the ACA&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_mandate">individual mandate</a> is not a tax, because it is a penalty.  That kind of argument has the cart leading the horse.<br />Taxes do increase revenues, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they cannot also be used to modify behavior, which is what penalties do.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The obvious type of taxes that act as penalties are excise taxes. There is considerable discussion about &#8220;sin taxes&#8221;&#8211;taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and other commodities or behaviors that are disliked.  If the person engages in the &#8216;bad&#8217; behavior, the person pays the tax penalty and at least the government gets some revenue from the misbehavior.  If the person is discouraged from engaging in the bad behavior because of the tax penalty, the penalty has done its job and there is more of the desired good behavior.  Tax penalties also exist in our current income tax laws&#8211;the &#8220;singles penalty&#8221;, as mentioned in a prior post, causes a single person to pay more tax than that person would if married, thus penalizing the person for failure to marry.  (Conversely, in situations where there is a <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/paul-morenos-short-history-of-the-taxing-power.html">marriage penalty</a>, the tax causes a married person to pay more tax than that person would if single, thus penalizing the person for failure to divorce.)  And there are many credits and other items that can be seen as simply notational variations on a penalty.  For example, the greater tax that childless couples pay than couples of the same income with children pay can easily be viewed as a tax penalty for not having children.</p>
<p>2.  The Tax Foundation tries to raise fears of a bad impact for states<br />The Tax Foundation&#8217;s next argument is the old &#8220;slippery slope&#8221; problem (and depends on the success of their first, unsuccessful, argument).  Since it claims the tax versus penalty distinction is &#8220;vital&#8221;, and there are local and state government revenue sources that are not generally thought of as taxes, the Foundation also claims that the Supreme Court&#8217;s purported broadening of the concept of tax could mean those state and local items must also be treated as taxes for state law purposes, and this could mean that they will be subject to different procedural rules for taxes rather than the procedural rules under which they were passed.<br />This appears beyond silly.   What it does mean for states is that a state like Massachusetts, that had already passed a state health care law with a mandate similar to the ACA&#8217;s mandate, can rest assured that it is not an unconstitutional form of tax.</p>
<p>3.  The Tax Foundation misunderstands the relationship between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> and the Taxing Power<br />The Foundation didn&#8217;t want the mandate upheld, and the right-wing is fighting hard for a much narrower view of the Commerce Clause with the idea of preventing progressives from undertaking needed national policies.  The Court found the Commerce Clause didn&#8217;t extend to the mandate, a conclusion which seems extraordinarily weak to me and which I predict will be overturned by another Court within thirty years.<br />But the Commerce Clause doesn&#8217;t decide the case, because the taxing power is even broader than the Commerce Clause power.  And Roberts rightly recognized that.  This was not a &#8220;twisting [of] the traditional and historic meaning of a tax&#8221; but rather the expected and predictable analysis based on the traditional and historic understanding of the taxing power.</p>
<p>4. The Tax Foundation raises the &#8220;direct&#8221; tax issue<br />Tax academics have devoted a lot of discussion to consider what would be a direct tax that had to be apportioned among the states.  Calvin Johnson, Professor at the University of Texas,  wrote an interesting book looking into the history of the Constitutional Convention as motivated in large part by a desire to get around the weak taxing power of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>, which required requisitions from the states to allow a strong taxing power in the federal government.  the passage of the income tax amendment&#8211;contravening any need for apportionment&#8211;pretty much left the direct/apportioned taxes as an archaic category.</p>
<p>The article cclaims that the mandate can&#8217;t fall within the income tax since it is a flat tax.  But of course everyone knows that the Tax Foundation and every other right-wing organization thinks that a flat tax on income is constitutional. </p>
<p>The Tax Foundation is quite simply wrong in suggesting that this is a &#8220;new&#8221; definition of tax.<br />(By the way, the Tax Foundation also attributes the entire opinion (and the purported &#8220;new definition&#8221;) to Chief Justice Roberts.  He was the author of the opinion for the Court, but the opinion represents the views of a majority of the Supreme Court Justices.  It is not just Roberts&#8217; opinion. )</p>

Even with my pointing out the subsidies in the ACA exceed that of the MA plan, there still has been quite a bit of doubt.</p>
<p>Maggie Mahar at the resurrected Health Beat Blog http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/07/what-will-the-supreme-courts-decision-mean-for-the-november-election-part-1/ <i></i>pointed to a new Kaiser Family Foundation subsidy calculator in her article as well as other informative points; &#8220;<i>What Will the Supreme Court Decision Mean In November?&#8221; </i>The ACA Premium Calculator is found here: <a href="http://healthreform.kff.org/Home/KHS/SubsidyCalculator.aspx?source=FS" target="_blank"><i>Healthcare Reform Subsidy Calculator.</i></a><br /><i></i><br /><a name="more"></a><i><br /></i><br />Using the KFF Calculator, a person can calculate what they will pay in premiums under the ACA in 2014. Further on down this post, there is a short discussion of the Mandate and a link to another KFF site to determine what the mandated penalty might be per year for an individual and a family. The last chart by &#8220;The Incidental Economist&#8221; touches upon the relative size of the Mandate in comparison to taxes historically. As a mandated penalty, Obamacare is a middle of the pack tax. </p>
<p>With the KFF calculator, assuming we are discussing Median Household Income, and making an addition assumption Household Median Income increases from the ~$51,000 in 2011 to ~$55,000 in 2013, this is what a family of 4 might pay in 2014:</p>
<p>&#8211; Income (family of 4) $55,000 (235% of Poverty)<br />&#8211; Policyholder Age: 45<br />&#8211; ESI: None Available<br />&#8211; Regional Cost Factor: Median<br />&#8211; Unsubsidized Healthcare Premium: $14,425<br />&#8211; Government Tax Credit: $10,110<br />&#8211; Out of Pocket Premium: $4,125<br />&#8211; 2014 Maximum Out of Pocket Expenses: $6,250</p>
<p>Mandate/Tax Penalty is huge? And what if an individual does not buy insurance from the state insurance exchanges; the individual would pay a Mandate Penalty in 2014 of $95/adult and $47.50 per child (or 1% of income, whichever is greater). In 2016, the mandate would be $695/adult and 50% for children (or 2.5% of income, whichever is greater). http://healthreform.kff.org/the-basics/Requirement-to-buy-coverage-flowchart.aspx <i>&#8220;The Requirement to Buy Healthcare Coverage&#8221; </i>For those who wish to argue Mandate versus Tax, please remember all laws are open to interpretation which does not change the initial intent of the Act passed by Congress.</p>
<p>ACA is the Biggest Tax Ever? It does not even come close to the tax Truman passed to cover WWII costs or even the Reagan Tax Increases of 1982. http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/obamacare-is-the-biggest-tax-increase-in-history-if-you-ignore-history/ Incidental Economist <i>&#8220;Obamacare is the Biggest Tax Ever, If You Ignore History&#8221;</i><br /><i><br /></i><br /><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-cT38JaKQ4mI/T_rZcorpFxI/AAAAAAAAA6A/99MqShSW6HA/s1600-h/clip_image003%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="clip_image003" border="0" height="169" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-EEpuzxeEJBA/T_rZc21wnpI/AAAAAAAAA6I/pl6HsN8qyCg/clip_image003_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" title="clip_image003" width="244"></a></p>

<p>Alabama&#8217;s Airbus Subsidy Eerily Reminiscent of Auto &#8220;Transplants&#8221;</p>
<p>The July 2 announcement that Airbus would begin assembly of its A-320 airliner in Mobile, Alabama, may be good for Alabama, but whether it&#8217;s good for the country as a whole is dubious. Indeed, it most reminds me of the subsidized arrival of foreign auto &#8220;transplants&#8221; that helped undermine Detroit&#8217;s Big 3 as well as the unionization of the auto industry.</p>
<p>The new $600 million facility is projected to create 1000 jobs. Initial reports put subsidies to the company as <a href="http://blog.al.com/live/2012/07/state_local_incentives_of_near.html">$158.5 million</a> from the state and various local governments (thanks to @varnergreg for pointing out this article). Remember, though, that initial reports are more likely to underestimate subsidies than overestimate them, as in the case of <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/wooing-of-electrolux-by-memphis.html">Electrolux in Memphis</a>. However, if this is remotely near accurate, Alabama got a much better deal for Airbus than did Washington state for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which was 220% of the investment and $1.65 million per job (according to my calculations for <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/investmentincentivesandtheglobalcompetitionforcapital/KennethPThomas"><i>Investment Incentives and the Global Competition for Capital</i></a>), more than 10 times the per job cost in Alabama.    </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this development could repeat the example of the subsidization of foreign automakers that hastened the decline of Detroit&#8217;s Big Three. According to economic geographer <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Changing_Us_Auto_Industry.html?id=zqpbKPwzm5wC">James Rubenstein</a> (1992, Table 1.1), from 1979 to 1991 there was a 1 to 1 correspondence in the opening and closing of new automobile and truck assembly plants in the U.S. and Canada: 20 new ones were built, 20 old ones were closed. Every one of the new facilities received subsidies from state and local (or federal and provincial, in Canada) governments. Given that the automobile industry was in a position of overcapacity for much of that period, it is no surprise that new production simply displaced older production.</p>

<p>Will the same thing now happen in the aircraft industry? Globally, Airbus has been <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/592001-boeing-vs-airbus-orders-and-profits">putting market share above profits </a>since the early 2000s. With its current move to Alabama, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/business/global/eads-to-build-airbus-assembly-line-in-mobile-ala.html">CEO Fabrice Brégier</a> said the company hoped to grow its U.S. market share for single-aisle planes (the A-320 competes mainly with the Boeing 737) from 17% to 50% over the next 20 years. If Airbus is successful, it would be bad for the <a href="http://www.boeing.com/aboutus/employment/employment_table.html">80,000+ employees</a> in Boeing&#8217;s Commercial Airplanes group.</p>
<p>Of course, there is growing global demand for airliners, especially in Asia. <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/592001-boeing-vs-airbus-orders-and-profits">But China has already developed its own competitor in the single-aisle market and Airbus is building A-320s in Tianjin, China</a>, making it unclear how much of the global growth can translate into increased U.S. employment.    </p>
<p>As was the case with foreign automakers, this is a case where a market-seeking investment was clearly coming to the United States, but the competition for the facility allowed Airbus to extract rents through the site selection process. By repeating this process for projects large and small, state and local governments deprive themselves of <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/07/subsidy-cuts-could-reduce-big-part-of.html">as much as $70 billion per year</a> in revenue, enough to hire all state and local employees laid off since the recession began in December 2007. At the same time, over the long haul, the process in the auto industry replaced well-paid unionized workers with less well-paid, non-union workers. The prospect that this evolution could be repeated in the aircraft industry is a pretty depressing one, when all is said and done. </p>

                                <p>Via Alternet, Andrew Weil pays homage to a little known but profound man, <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story/156160/we_have_happy_pills%2C_anxiety_drugs%2C_and_therapists_galore%3A_so_why_are_we_more_stressed_and_depressed_than_ever?page=1" target="_blank">George Engles</a>, who decades ago in 1977 proposed thinking differently on the medical model common to the US practices. <br />
<blockquote>I want you to consider the possibility that the basic assumptions of mainstream psychiatric medicine are obsolete and no longer serve us well. Those assumptions constitute the biomedical model of mental health and dominate the whole field.</p>
<p>In 1977, the journal Science published a provocative article titled “The Need for a New Medical Model: A Challenge for Biomedicine.” I consider it a landmark in medical philosophy and the intellectual foundation of today’s integrative medicine. The author, George L. Engel, M.D., was a professor of psychiatry at the University of Rochester (New York) School of Medicine. Determined to overcome the limiting influence of Cartesian dualism, which assigns mind and body to separate realms, Engel envisioned medical students of the future learning that health and illness result from an interaction of biological, psychological, social, and behavioral factors, not from biological factors alone. He fathered the field of psychosomatic medicine and devoted much of his career to broadening our understanding of disease. He was particularly interested in mental health.</p>
<p>George Engel died in 1999 with his vision largely unrealized. In fact, the field of psychosomatic medicine ran out of steam sometime before his death and was never able to challenge the ascendancy of biological medicine.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah well&#8230;.I will be losing electricity shortly and this note will have to suffice for now.   Anyway, a much younger Mrs. Rdan was part of this team at the University of Rochester in the early seventies&#8230;.good to see the name George Engles again.</p>

<p>Now the use of textbooks and the sharing of a new textbook can be stopped with the sale of a yearly access code to engage in discussion boards by students with instructors. The Publishing Industry with the help of one Economics Professor has found a way to stop the sharing of text books amongst students and the sales of old text books to the next incoming classes. New students will be forced to buy a new text book or buy a special code allowing them to use the book new or old. The press release describing the new invention put it in this manner:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><i>&#8220;In the case of a used book or pirated download, the student pays for the access code,&#8221; according to the press release. &#8220;No payment — no access code — no participation — lower final grade.&#8221; <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/47969316/ns/technology_and_science-security/"><i>Professor Patents way . ..</i></a></i></p>

The world and its knowledge turn much faster leaving students to beg for the obsolete education resources paid for by a hefty tuition<i>. </i></p>

<p>Lack Of Market Reaction To SCOTUS Ruling On Obamacare Sends Opponents Into Frenzy</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, former Obama advisor Austan Goolsbee published a column in the Wall Street Journal entitled &#8220;The Supreme Court Rules, The Market Yawns,&#8221; noting only a small drop in the stock market (about 26 points on the DJIA) on June 28, 2012, the day the SCOTUS ruled most of the ACA to be constitutional.  A nice link can be found on Economists View for &#8220;Links for 07-05-2012&#8221; at <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/">http://economistsview.typepad.com/</a> .  Commentary on Mark Thoma&#8217;s link was limited and restrained, mostly discussing fine points of mandates versus taxes and how long the new system might last (which I have many criticisms of, for the record, not my first choice for a reform).<br />    <br />OTOH, when Tyler Cowen made the same link  almost no commentary at <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/from-austan-goolsbee.html">http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/from-austan-goolsbee.html</a> , many of his commenters simply went bananas.  Besides the name-calling and usual ranting, the substantive point argued was that the market did fall in the immediate aftermath of the announcement (which overturned the strong forecast on intrade, much revered by readers of MR), only to rally later in the day after positive news about European bonds (and to be followed by major gains the following day, supposedly on the bond news as well).  Certainly there were hysterians who think Obamneycare is the end of the world who sold immediately, but it did not take much for others to leap in and start buying and move right on past the decision.  One individual denouncing Goolsbee provided a link, but this one rather sensibly noted that stocks in the healthcare sector went in different directions, with hospital ones generally going up and health insurance ones generally going down.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>   <br />While Goolsbee perhaps should have noted the initial market drop after the announcement, he was basically right.  There really is no sound basis for thinking that Obamneycare is going to tank the economy.  Many critics say it increases uncertainty, but in fact a negative decision would have increased uncertainty as many would be losing new gains from the law (children under 26 on their health insurance to name one) without knowing what might come next.  That the GOP continues to oppose the law means that there remains uncertainty, although those ranting about uncertainty somehow never notice that their opposition to the law is aggravating this uncertainty &#8220;problem.&#8221;<br />    <br />As it is, the best evidence we have on how the law might work is to look at its predecessor in Massachusetts, RomneyCare implemented in 2006.  According to a January article in Forbes (not  a left wing publication at all), <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerapoza/2012/01/romney-care-massachusetts-healthcare-reform">http://www.forbes.com/sites/kerapoza/2012/01/romney-care-massachusetts-healthcare-reform</a> , not only is 99% of the population now with health insurance, but the law is so popular that no Massachusetts Republicans are remotely talking about repealing it.  Small business people were quoted as supporting it, the group supposedly most likely to suffer under Obamacare (aside from those who expect to get free medical care from emergency rooms even if they have never paid a cent for any kind of health insurance or care).  The current issue in MA is that there are efforts to reduce the costs of the program, but no movement at all to repeal it.  It is a clear success, even if its prime author now opposes its nationwide application.<br />    <br />I cannot resist posing a point that has bothered me for some time.  Much has been made of the fact that the individual mandate was originally proposed by a Republican think tank in 1989, the Heritage Foundation.  It was supported by numerous GOP pols since then, with the implementation by a Republican in MA, Romney, simply the obvious highwater mark of this.  This support only came to an end the minute Obama came out for it (rather than single payer) in an open attempt to have a bipartisan bill.  Of course, in the end, not a single Republican in Congress voted for it, not one, without a single one professing the slightest embarrassment about jumping from supporting it to denouncing it as &#8220;unconstitutional socialism&#8221; not to mention even greater idiocies such as opponents shrieking in town hall meetings about &#8220;death panels&#8221; that went on for some time (where are those anyway?).<br />    <br />So, it is my observation that this is the biggest mass shift of the views of a political party on a major issue since the US Communist Party did so regarding Hitler in 1939 and back again the other way in 1941.  I have asked numerous people to name any other shift by any US party on any issue since then that beats or even matches this one by the GOP.  Nobody has come up with one.<br />  <br />My final observation on this is that at least back in 1939 there were enough members of the CPUSA who had principles and honor to resign from the party when it made its pro-Hitler shift in the wake of the Mototov-von Ribbentrop Pact.   I have seen not a single member of the recent US Republican Party about whom the same could be said, and the public repudiations of their own views by Stuart Butler of Heritage and Mitt Romney are astoundingly pathetic by comparison.</p>

                                <p>Lifted from Robert&#8217;s Stochastic Thoughts comes this comment on Matt Yglesias: </p>
<p>by Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Matthew Yglesias <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/07/05/does_uncompensated_care_raise_prices_for_the_insured_.html#article_comment_box">asks</a>  (<a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">Does Uncompensated Care Raise Prices for the Insured?)</a><br /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766"><br /></a><br />. I am having trouble with moneybox comments so I comment here. OK first I have to note that a philosophy concentrator half my age is doing pretty well to make me think about economics. Yglesias&#8217;s willingness to think and write about technical subjects is a valuable national resource. This is also true of field specialists can respond to his arguments.   <br />His argument<br />
<blockquote>Think about the CVS downstairs from my office. It charges prices that it believes are profit-maximizing. Now suppose some indigent person comes in and burns all the magazines on their magazine rack for fun. The guy&#8217;s got no money, so CVS can&#8217;t recoup its losses. Does this force CVS to raise prices on Diet Coke to make up for the cost? No—CVS was already charging profit-maximizing prices, and past losses are irrelevant to determining optimal forward-looking pricing strategy.</p></blockquote>

<p>Hmm logically this implies that people who live in high crime neighborhoods in which people do stuff like that don&#8217;t pay more for goods. But they do. So what is missing ?<br />    <br />Well first the thought experiment considers an unanticipateable cost and one repetition of which is not likely. Uncompensated health care isn&#8217;t like that at all.<br />    <br />Even a totally profit oriented for profit hospital chain will consider the forecast rate of unconmpensated care when deciding whether to invest in building new hospitals. A cost which doesn&#8217;t affect the marginal cost of a good or service and doesn&#8217;t in itself effect the elasticity of demand will affect entry, which depends on forecast average cost and not on marginal cost.<br />    <br />This will affect prices. The reason is that with higher unavoidable costs a higher ratio of price to marginal cost is required to convinced firms to enter.<br />    <br />Let&#8217;s imagine a socially useful application of Yglesias&#8217;s theory (if it were valid). Stealing from CVS and giving the the stolen goods to the median citizen would be a distortion free transfer from CVS shareholders to people on average poorer than CVS shareholders. This would cause increased welfare. I don&#8217;t think Yglesias thinks this would be a good approach.<br />    <br />I don&#8217;t think he thought the problem through to the end (oops I mean to the beginning &#8212; entry of firms).</p>

<p>Paul Moreno&#8217;s &#8220;short history&#8221; of the taxing power</p>
<p>At the May meeting of the American Bar Association Tax Section, Jaspar (Jack) Cummings  (a well-renowned tax practitioner who has written extensively on the Supreme Court&#8217;s tax jurisprudence) and I gave a joint keynote speech for the Tax Section&#8217;s Diversity Committee.  Our address covered various aspects of Supreme Court jurisprudence past, present, and expected future.  While we disagreed on many interpretative details, there was one thing that we were both quite clear on:  the insurance mandate in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act">Affordable Care Act</a> should (and, we predicted, would) be upheld as a constitutional exercise of the taxing power. </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s Wall Street Journal ran an op-ed by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Moreno">Paul Moreno</a>, titled &#8220;A Short History of Congress&#8217;s Power to Tax&#8221; (July 7, 2012).  The problem with the history is that it mentions a few items from the Constitutional Convention history, and then selectively wanders through a few Supreme Court cases.  It ultimately asserts that Robert&#8217;s opinion for the majority on the health insurance in the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in NFIB v. Sibelius was &#8220;dangerous to constitutional government&#8221; because it supported an &#8220;unlimited taxing power.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Maybe historians (Moreno is a historian at <a href="http://www.hillsdale.edu/">Hillsdale College</a>) should leave tax analysis to tax experts.  Let me say this here for the record:  the Supreme Court would have looked utterly foolish if it had failed to uphold the mandate as an exercise of the taxing power.   As noted by another commentator, failure to recognize the mandate&#8217;s legitimacy under the taxing power would suggest that it was unconstitutional to tax to insure those under age 65, while Medicare is constitutional for taxing those at 65 or over.  Further, it would make an impossible distinction between the insurance mandate&#8217;s penalty provision and what could be called the Internal Revenue Code&#8217;s marriage mandate penalty provision&#8221;.  That is, the income tax sometimes taxes singles more than married couples, resulting in what is called a &#8220;singles penalty&#8221;&#8211;higher taxation on earnings to a single person than would result for that person in a married couple.    (There is also sometimes a<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_penalty">marriage penalty</a>.  All this depends on how the progressivity of the Code rate structure interacts with the fact that we don&#8217;t treat every &#8220;tub on its own bottom&#8221;.)</p>
