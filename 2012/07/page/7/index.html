<p>Health care thoughts:  Bundling Medical Payments<br /> 
<div>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA) is chocked full of pilot programs, mandates, guarantees, prohibitions,  penalties, taxes and experiments. One of those experiments may define the future  of Medicare funding for surgeons, and then may define the future of most of the  physician revenue cycle.  Bundling.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bundling  (also known by other names such as episode  payment, global payment, global bundled payment or even packaged pricing) allows  the insurer  to pay one provider for the  entire episode of care, requiring the provider then to contract with and pay all  of the other required providers. States and private insurers are also moving  toward their own bundling experiments.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There have been some tests of this concept for both  cardiac and orthopaedic services, but not at a scale to prove the concept. PPACA  provides for Medicare pilot programs. Ultimately bundling will only become  standard procedure when bundling can provide good outcomes with cost savings,  formidable goals.</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>A commonly cited example in commentaries is a hip  fracture in an elderly (therefore Medicare) patient.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the current system the patient and Medicare  would receive billings from the ambulance, the emergency department, the  emergency department physicians, the hospital, the orthopaedic surgeon, a  nursing facility (rehab bed) the physical therapist, and a pharmacy (during the  rehab stay). </div>
<div></div>
<div>Under a bundled system the bundling would likely  begin when the patient arrives at the hospital, and would end when the patient  is discharged from the rehab center to home, the end of the episode.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The advantages to the government could be very real  – the total cost of the episode is controlled and there is a power incentive for  best outcomes without any unnecessary care.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The advantage to the hospital is clear, the  hospital is now officially the hub of the wheel and has immense power over  patient care (the bundling concept will likely be combined with other new wave  concepts such as accountable care organizations (ACOs)).  The hospital or integrated delivery service  might also attempt to simplify the process by owning and employing all of the  providers. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The hub organization of the bundle will need very,  very  sophisticated IT and cost  accounting abilities, be able to negotiate contracts with diverse providers,  supervise and coordinate the providers, conduct plan of care activities to  maximize outcomes while minimizing spending, and move patients toward high  quality outcomes or suffer the penalties.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This system will almost certainly cause tension  between hub organizations and other providers, both need each other but both  have turf and economic interests to protect. Most of the talk now is about  revenue sharing, at some point risk sharing will come onto the table, especially  when bundling is a part of an ACO or some other integration scheme.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bundling will likely come on gradually, and there  are at multiple models and multiple possible variations with those models.  Bundling will get caught up in other schemes, including ACOs, and there may be  new models we do not even recognize at this time. The experiment has  begun.</div>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.alternet.org/teaparty/156231/ayn_randroids_and_libertarians_join_forces%3A_will_her_noxious_philosophy_further_infect_america/" target="_blank">alternet</a> comes this bit of news:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;John Allison, a former bank CEO and a leader of the Rand movement, has just become president of the Cato Institute, the oldest and most influential libertarian think tank. This received only a modest amount of attention when it surfaced late last month, and you had to be a real political junkie to even be aware of it. But it is a seminal event in recent political history—a dramatic indication of the mainstreaming of the radical right.</p>
<p>What it means is that the Rand movement, which was little more than a cult when the Atlas Shrugged author died thirty years ago, has effectively merged with the vastly larger libertarian movement. While many differences are likely to remain—particularly as far as Ron Paul’s fading candidacy is concerned, given the Randers&#8217; support for abortion and opposition to his foreign policy views —this means that Objectivism, Rand’s quasi-religious philosophy, is going to permeate the political process more than ever before.</p>
<p>Allison, former CEO of North Carolina’s BB&#038;T Bank, is not just going to be the Cato Institute’s sugar daddy. He replaces Ed Crane as president, meaning that he will have day-to-day control over the most significant libertarian organization in the country. Allison is a board member of the Ayn Rand Institute, the orthodox, no-compromise Randian organization, and is best known for his foundation donating free Rand books to thousands of schoolchildren across the nation—a crass exploitation of the fiscal troubles besetting primary schools.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It’s no secret I am a bad economist:  I don’t believe rent control is a bad thing, I consider most of the job-matching models to be ludicrous when someone tries to use them to claim unemployment compensation extends people’s period of unemployment, and I really, really, really don’t believe the equity premium is anything but a legacy of artificially-suppressed Government bond yields and fluke periods of excessive rents combined fortuitously with an absurdist survivor bias. Otherwise, Modigliani-Miller should be correct and when you start measuring corporate returns against Government bonds, the “premium” looks a lot like an overestimation of expected inflation (Π<sup>e</sup>)<br />But if I had to model why an equity premium <em>might</em> be possible, I would suggest that there might be a combination of undue pessimism (expectations of higher inflation and/or lower real growth) and clear indicators of companies that are more likely to be part of the survivor bias. Such as, for instance, management buying its own stock instead of <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/shareholder-value/" target="_blank">paying out more in buybacks and dividends than it makes in profits</a>. (You know, the “<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/22/nation/na-bush22" target="_blank">miracle of compound interest</a>” and all that.)<br />One of the things that would make me hesitate to think a company was going to come out on the right side of survivor bias is insiders selling their stock.  Or not buying it when they have a chance to do so.  <em>Especially</em> if they buy something else.<br />Don’t get me wrong; I think <em>employees</em> who buy company stock for their own 401(k) are <a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/2012/07/you-want-to-run-into-room-shouting-no-o.html" target="_blank">pawns at best</a>, idiots at worst.  Even Upper Middle Management—defined as people with the authority to say “yes” to some things without asking higher-ups—will rarely have a material positive effect on the company’s stock price. (My father retired with three or four patents to his name; their bottom line effect on Ford stock was indistinguishable from zero—maybe negative, if you count “made a better product for a while and so stayed in a market they eventually left” as misallocation of resources.)  But the guy’s running the company—especially when they also <em>own the majority of the company</em>—those are the people who should be buying equity, not taking it out of the company as they cash out their stock options.<br />What does this have to do with football?  Well, the Glazer family happens to own a football team.  (Yes, I’m talking about real football, not “<a href="http://forums.televisionwithoutpity.com/index.php?showtopic=497846&#038;st=2100" target="_blank">putting on forty pounds of protective gear to play rugby</a>.”)  It happens to be an English team—a member in good standing of the English Premier League—that is very good for an English team.  Which means that this year it was the second-best team in its City, it lost in the early rounds of the Champions League, and it qualified for what many expect will be another “Early Exit”—this phrase should be trademarked as the standard of English Football teams since at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_1%E2%80%930_England_(1950_FIFA_World_Cup)" target="_blank">1950</a>—in next year’s Champions League.<br />But the <a href="http://www.manutd.com/Splash-Page.aspx" target="_blank">Red Devils</a> have many fans who would like to own a piece of the team just to say they do.  Many of those fans are in England, but apparently there are enough of them in the United States—I know several; generally nice enough people even with that character flaw—that the team will be listed not on the LSE, but rater on the NYSE.  So I expect that—as with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visteon#History" target="_blank">Visteon</a>—I will be able one day soon to wander down to the area near the Federal Reserve and see a bunch of people wearing shirts advertising Aon Insurance (previous sponsor: AIG) celebrating and giving away some swag—say, <a href="http://bustedcoverage.com/2012/06/14/wayne-rooneys-hair-plugs-seem-to-be-filling-in-quite-nicely-at-euro-2012/" target="_blank">imitation Wayne Rooney hair plugs</a> (warning: site NSF Self-Respecting Humans) or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_Giggs#Gagging_order" target="_blank">Ryan Giggs’s used condoms</a>—or something else that will be arguably more valuable than a few hundred shares of stock that amount to a small fraction of the listing that is only about 10% of the company anyway.<br />Why am I disparaging the stock? Well, after the FT and the WSJ did—and probably Deadspin, Gawker, and maybe even <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2012/07/how-zero-hedge-makes-your-money-vanish.html" target="_blank">Noah Smith’s favorite site</a>, Zero Hedge (oh, come on, I really don’t need to provide links those five sites, do I?)—it would almost feel like piling on.<br />But then we come back to the Equity Premium.<br />You see, there’s one good reason that there <em>should</em> be an Equity Premium.  Despite the best efforts of the Delaware Chancery Courts, Equity is still <em>subordinate</em> to debt.  If you run low on cash, you’re supposed to pay your debt holders and reduce—or even forego—dividend payments.*<br />So equities <em>should</em> have a premium—it’s a risk-adjusted premium for the likelihood of the firm not being so much of a “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_concern#Use_in_Accounting" target="_blank">Going Concern</a>” in the future as it is now.  We may have modeled Expected Free Cash Flow (FCF), but those expectations might be wrong, too.  And the risk is asymmetric.**<br />Which means the worst thing for any equity investor would be to see the owners of their company selling the company’s equity and buying its debt.<br />Which, as my ex-roommate noted in email, is <em>precisely</em> what “<a href="https://news.fidelity.com/news/news.jhtml?cat=IPO&#038;articleid=201207070033RTRSNEWSCOMBINED_BRE866029_1&#038;IMG=Y" target="_blank">what some of the Glazers themselves are doing</a>.”<br />ManU’s stock offering is for people who thought that the Facebook founders gave up too much control.  And if you throw in that the team is incorporating in Romneyville, a.k.a., <a href="https://news.fidelity.com/news/news.jhtml?cat=IPO&#038;articleid=201207121858RTRSNEWSCOMBINED_BRE86B1HL_1&#038;IMG=Y" target="_blank">The Cayman Islands, so that the new shareholders can be even more subordinate than they would have been otherwise</a>, it’s clear that their fans would be far better off investing their money by going to Ladbroke’s and <a href="http://www.oddschecker.com/football/champions-league/winner" target="_blank">taking 7:1</a> on <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1194581-13-reasons-manchester-united-will-win-the-champions-league-in-2013" target="_blank">ManU to win the 2013 Champions League</a>.  Or the 16:1 currently offered for the double of the EPL and the Champions League.<br />At least then, even <strike>when</strike> if they lose, the winner wouldn’t be someone who was betting against the house while holding the mortgage.</p>
<p>*The end run of Stock Buybacks, not to mention the last twenty-five years of the court rulings, have rather eviscerated debt holders’s position in the queue, but we still at least pay lip service to the seniority.<br />**Short version: If you call the “equity premium” a “risk-adjusted return on capital,” it is much more likely that I will believe you might have a working model.  If you keep pointing to the U.S. from, say, 1937-1967 when the economy was growing and the coupon on Government debt was artificially low—looking at you, <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.academicwebpages.com%2Fpreview%2Fmehra%2Fpdf%2FThe%2520Equity%2520Premium%2520A%2520Puzzle.pdf" target="_blank">Prescott and Mehra</a>—then I’m going to laugh at you.</p>

<p>  The US real trade balance has been bouncing around current level for the last two years &#8211;being neither a significant contribution nor a significant drag on  growth.  This is a significantly different picture than the nominal trade balance shows  where the trade deficit is still widening.</p>

<p>Much of the apparent stability in the real trade balance has been oil as the real non-oil trade balance<br />has continue to widen and dampen economic growth.</p>

<p>On a net basis &#8212; imports less exports&#8211; oil imports have collapsed over the past few years.  Net real petroleum imports  are  now only about half of their peak level in 2005..</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-58xa-ERYkmM/T_8TKbDapKI/AAAAAAAACKs/hg103GXIKJ4/s1600/Clipboard01+trade+1.bmp"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-58xa-ERYkmM/T_8TKbDapKI/AAAAAAAACKs/hg103GXIKJ4/s320/Clipboard01+trade+1.bmp" width="320"></a></div>
<p> Moreover, oil  exports &#8212; both crude and refined products &#8212; are now equal to about one third of imports<br />as refiners are taking advantage of the lower price of West Texas Intermediate to take foreign markets away from foreign refiners that use the more expensive Brent crude.  This data also demonstrates that all the  wild claims about the need to open a new pipeline from Canada is just political posturing.  Oil is almost perfectly fungible and it will make little difference to the world oil markets or what we pay for oil, if Canada exports its oil via pipelines  to Oklahoma or through its Pacific ports.  Essentially all  the pipeline would do is permit US Gulf Coast refineries to refine the Canadian oil and reexport it.</p>

<div>Beverly,</p>
<p>Re: Romney&#8217;s IRA contributions, there was a WSJ article in the past several days that talked about them &#8211; they were often a special share class of the PE deals that Bain invested in, where the majority of the value of the company was assigned to the other share class. There are examples of these &#8220;low-value class&#8221; shares making 600% in several years.</p>
<p>The tax strategy (made sense at the time, less so now) was to put these high(?)-risk, high-reward share classes in your IRA, and your mandatory allocation of the other (lower risk, lower reward) share class in to your taxable brokerage account.</p>
<p>The article quotes tax professionals who question the aggressiveness of the Bain share class valuations.</p>

<div>I wrote up a reply to Steve’s comment, but the Comments function won’t let me post it there because the comment is too long.  So, here it is:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Thanks, Steve.  When I read your comment, I remembered reading something about this in the Vanity Fair article (which I read only once, on Jul. 3), and just went back and reread that part of it.  Here’s what it says:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Romneys won’t say, but Mark Maremont, writing in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, uncovered a likely explanation. When Bain Capital bought companies, it would create two classes of shares, named A and L. The A shares were risky common shares, to which they would assign a very low value. The L shares were preferred shares, paying a high dividend but with the payoff frozen, and most of the value was assigned to them. Bain employees would then put the exciting A shares in their I.R.A. accounts, where they grew tax-free. With all the risk of the deal, the A shares stood to gain a lot or collapse. But if the deal succeeded, the springing value could be stunning: Bain employees saw their A shares from one particularly fruitful deal grow 583-fold, 16 times faster than the underlying stock.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Romneys won’t tell us how, or even if, they assigned super-low values to the A shares, but there are a couple of ways to do it. One is to use standard options models to price the shares—then feed inappropriate assumptions into those models. Romney could alternatively have used a model called liquidation valuation, which Kleinbard [Ed Kleinbard, a USC tax law professor whom the author contacted in researching the issue] says would have been “completely inappropriate.” Without seeing the assumptions used on Romney’s tax returns from the years when those lowball A shares were squirted into his I.R.A., we cannot know how he did it. Whatever methods he used, however, the valuations were, according to Andrew Smith, of Houlihan Capital in Chicago, “pushing the envelope.” (Andrea Saul retorts, “Why should successful investments be criticized?”)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I remembered that when I read those paragraphs last week, I said to myself in answer to Saul’s rhetorical question: “The relevant question here is not whether successful investments should be criticized, but instead whether <i>illegal</i>investments should be criticized.”  The investments themselves weren’t illegal, but the classification of the stock into two arbitrarily-divided classifications in order to give falsely low valuations on one class in order to create huge nontaxable profits, sure as hell sounds to me like it <i>was</i>illegal.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Krugman says there possible legal ways that the IRA gains could have been so huge.  But the way described in the Vanity Fair article and in the WSJ article doesn’t appear to be legal in Romney’s instance, even though this tactic would be legal in other instances—i.e., when there is some actual tangible difference between the risk and value of the two classes of stocks, and when the stock placed in the IRA is given a legitimate, rather than fraudulently low, value.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The relevant paragraphs of the WSJ article read:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The tax-deferral opportunity stemmed from the way Bain often chose to structure the shares of companies after taking them over.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Even if the companies had only one share class, Bain frequently gave them two classes, usually called Class L and Class A, according to former employees, Bain internal documents and securities filings. Because Bain controlled the companies, it had flexibility in assigning values to the classes.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="U603582489550YDF"></a>Class L shares, akin to preferred stock, were safer and had a higher initial value. They had priority if the company paid dividends, and holders of these shares were the first to receive proceeds from a sale or liquidation. The shares also accrued interest, often at 10% to 12%.
</p>
</div>
<div><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="U603582489550J0D"></a>Bain assigned a much lower value to Class A shares, which were riskier but potentially more profitable.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="U603582489550SJB"></a>If Bain sold or liquidated a company it had taken over for less than was owed to Class L shareholders, the Class A shares lost all of their value.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766" name="U603582489550NSB"></a>But once Class L shareholders got their money, Class A shareholders received the bulk of additional gains, often as much as 90% of them, according to the documents and former employees. In successful deals, the A shares could skyrocket.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Can it really be that all that was legally necessary was to simply separate objectively identically-valuable stocks from a single company into two classes of stocks whose only difference is the arbitrary value that the company assigns the stocks, rather than the actual tangible value of the stocks?</p>
<p>
<div>&#8212;-
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>UPDATE: To my utter knock-me-over-with-a-feather astonishment, Business Insider’s Henry Blodget posted <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/what-romney-is-hiding-2012-7#ixzz20RvRBcV8">an article </a>early this morning based partly on, and linking to, um … um … my “Romney’s VERY Private Equity” post from yesterday.  The link to my post is in the sentence “This ‘structuring’ has also likely taken advantage of offshore accounts, the contribution of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/romneys-very-private-equity-2012-7">hard-to-value securities at low valuations to Romney&#8217;s IRA (whereupon they exploded in value)</a>, ….” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Cool! Thanks, Mr. Blodget! 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Then this afternoon, he posted a follow-up titled “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/how-mitt-romney-made-money-2012-7">Wait—MaybeTHIS Is How Mitt Romney Got So Rich&#8230;</a>,” in he explains (based on the surprising revelation in the Boston Globe article that during the period of 1999 to 2002Romney owned 100% of Bain stock), how Romney’s IRA account might actually have acquired so much money legally. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Since Blodget may well have figured out how that IRA came to be worth so much, without even having to channel Sherlock Holmes, I thought I should let readers know.  Although I think he may be wrong and that Bain really did stage a quiet Louvre heist.  Has anyone noticed whether Mona Lisa looks slightly more like a Bain CEO than she used to?</div>

                                <p>Lifted from Robert&#8217;s personal blog comes this thought:</p>
<p><em>Ballance</em> in the Washington Post Again &#8211; Robert&#8217;s thoughts</p>
<p>This is part of <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&#038;sclient=psy-ab&#038;q=ballance+site:rjwaldmann.blogspot.com&#038;oq=ballance+site:rjwaldmann.blogspot.com&#038;gs_l=hp.12...9824.17359.0.18628.37.37.0.0.0.0.161.2506.33j4.37.0...0.0.hHITE8TdWyE&#038;pbx=1&#038;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&#038;fp=b4c92a2d29177826&#038;biw=1299&#038;bih=558">a series</a>.<br />    <br />As usual, I think the latest is the all time winner. The concept of Ballance is that reporting and commentary must reach balanced conclusions no matter what the facts are. It is named after former representative Jack Ballance (see google search above).<br />    <br />I knew it would not be good for my blood pressure to read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/could-a-truly-honest-politician-become-president/2012/07/06/gJQAGK4OSW_story_1.html">Could a truly honest politician become president?</a> by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, so I avoided it but was brought back by DemFromCt&#8217;s one word answer <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/08/1107373/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Round-up-Class-warfare-edition">&#8220;No.&#8221;</a><br />    <br />I have read only the first page and I will read no more. I note that in the all time winning example of the pundit&#8217;s fallacy Jamieson answers her question &#8220;yes&#8221; in spite of providing massive evidence that the answer is no (with a possible exception for someone who couldn&#8217;t lie, knowingly speak a falsehood, because he didn&#8217;t know anything.<br />    <br />But that&#8217;s not my beat. The number one example of Ballance is accusing Barack Obama of dishonesty, because he accurately summarized an article in The Washington Post.<br />    <br />&#8221; The Obama campaign misused a recent Washington Post article to label Romney as an “outsourcer in chief.”&#8221;<br />    <br />Yes the Post blew it and actually reported unballanced facts about which candidate outsourced more. So they must make up for this by complaining that Obama took their remarks out of context. This is pathetic. A disagreement about whether a summary is fair or not is a sign that someone is being dishonest. Anyone with any grasp of ethics at all would understand that a Washington Post columnist can&#8217;t be a fair referee of a debate between the Post and Obama. Anyone who is not determined to be ballanced has to note that the Romney campaign said the Post confused outsoursing and offshoring because they wrote about outsourcing. I note and stress that this blatantly fallacious argument from the Romney campaign is not noted with the complaint about Obama added for Ballance.<br />
<blockquote><a name="more"></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Rather Jaemieson notes nothing wrong with the Romney campaigns response to the Post&#8217;s article. She can&#8217;t as then her first page would be unballanced. Therefore she has to argue that whatever the Obama campaign allegedly did is incomparably worse than introducing a word &#8220;offshoring&#8221; and saying that the Post is wrong because if a word in their article was replaced with that different word, then it would be false. This is like claiming that if one says &#8220;Romney is dishonest&#8221; one is wrong because one has said &#8220;Rommey is honest&#8221; and confused &#8220;dishonest&#8221; and &#8220;honest.&#8221; But that outrage against language truth an logic can&#8217;t be criticized *at all] because it would ruin the ballance.<br />    <br />Jamieson&#8217;s utter inability to honestly address honesty is proven above. One rule (not just at the Post) is that you can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s bad without saying it&#8217;s bad and getting worse. So she must not only present the case that Romney&#8217;s dishonesty dwarfs Obama&#8217;s, but also argue that Obama is less honest than earlier Democratic candidates. So he is dishonest for quoting the Washington Post while Kennedy is honest    <br />&#8220;John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 treated their rivals’ positions and records fairly, forthrightly forecast their governing approaches and hewed to the facts. With the exception of the Democratic attack on the alleged missile gap, which Kennedy may have believed existed, neither the 1960 Democratic nominee nor his Republican counterpart, Richard M. Nixon, distorted his or his opponent’s plans.&#8221;<br />    <br />OK so the fact that Kennedy &#8220;may&#8221; have believed his fals claims means he is fair and honest. The standard for Obama is no one claims to have been taken out of context. The standard for Kennedy is there is no proof beyond reasonable doubt. With utter total contempt for the data, Jamieson has decided (I guess as a methodological a priori) that both sides are roughly equally at fault and that things have gotten worse. So she must say that a false claim of fact on a hugely important issue which &#8220;may have&#8221; been an honest mistake is honest, while an arguable summary of an article is much much worse.    <br />Note also the tricky Dicky exception to Ballance. When discussing the fact Jamieson says Nixon&#8217;s 1960 campaign was basically honest, but somehow he doesn&#8217;t make the list of honest candidates along with Mondale, Kennedy and Reagan.<br />    <br />Just before clicking over here, I begged the internets to compare the honesty of statements made by Romney and Nixon. I am quite sure that candidate Romney has lied vastly vastly more than candidate Nixon did (of course President Nixon lied about whether he was a crook &#8212; but I think his campaign was much more honest than Kennedy 1960 (for whom of course I would have voted) Reagan ever or Obama 2008 (he claimed that he thought no individual mandate was needed).<br />    <br />Now I don&#8217;t want an honest candidate. For me true honesty in a Democratic hopeful true honesty (like Mondale&#8217;s, McGovern&#8217;s or Carter&#8217;s) is a deal breaker. I am not Kant and I think it is sometimes morally right to lie. But all the same, Jamieson&#8217;s total contempt for the facts appalls me.</p>

<p>Health Care Thoughts: Crazy like Foxes?</p>
<p>Several governors are announcing  they will not begin building the state health exchanges required by PPACA  (Obamacare). Some of this is pure partisan, and some a stall until  November.</p>
<p>Failure to comply will result in the feds installing exchanges  in those states.</p>
<p>The states can apparently opt in to the exchange at a  later date.</p>
<p>Could this be a means of allowing the feds to do all of the  heavy lifting, and then jumping in at a convenient time later? Is there more  than partisan thinking here? Interesting?</p>

                                <p>by Mike Kimel</p>
<p> A Partial Review of <i>Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box</i><br />by Bob Deitrick and Lew Goldfarb</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, Michael Kanell of the Atlanta Journal Constitution and I wrote <ital>Presimetrics.</ital>  In it, we looked at how Presidents did on a wide range of issues &#8211; everything from abortions to the national debt.  We measured performance the same way for every issue &#8211; looking at how things changed from right before an<br />administration took office to right before it left office, and in each case, we got the data from the most objective source available.  Our approach was imperfect, but by maintaining consistency in how we approached each issue, we tried to be as unbiased as possible.  And on many issues, we found that Presidents did well tended to follow similar policies to other Presidents that did well on the same issues,<br />and likewise, the Presidents who did poorly on the issues also tended to have similar policies to other Presidents who did poorly on the issues.</p>
<p>The book got virtually no press so almost nobody ever heard of it, and it didn&#8217;t sell all that well, which is obviously too bad for both me and Michael Kanell.  But what I think is too bad for most Americans is<br />that the notion of trying to put an objective measure on the performance of our politicians hasn&#8217;t caught on.  Sure, there are the various &#8220;think tanks&#8221; purporting to do just that, but they seem to start with a conclusion and work their way backward to justify that conclusion.  I find that sort of thing less than useful.</p>
<p>As a result, I was pleased to hear from reader Susan M. about a new book entitled <i><ital>Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box: How the </ital><ital>Performance of OUR Presidents Has Impacted YOUR Wallet</ital></i> by Bob<br />Deitrick and Lew Goldfarb.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p> I didn&#8217;t find a copy at my local bookstore, so I ordered a copy online and it just came in the mail. I&#8217;ve read through the first two chapters already, its an easy, interesting and informative read.  It ranks Presidents on their economic performance (from the perspective of the national economy, individuals&#8217; wealth, and business prosperity), and then comes up with an overall ranking.</p>
<p>The rankings produced by Deitrick and Goldfarb in <ital>Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box</ital> come out a bit different from those Michael Kanell and I produced in <ital>Presimetrics</ital> as they don&#8217;t use all of the same measures we employ (and vice versa), but the conclusions they reach aren&#8217;t that different.  Provided you aren&#8217;t<br />deliberately torturing it, on average the data says what the data says.  Whether or not you read <ital>Presimetrics</ital>, I heartily recommend <ital>Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box</ital>.  The world will be very different if we start following the spirit of books like this and making an effort to measure the performance of our leaders as objectively as possible&#8230;  and then holding our leaders accountable for their performance or lack thereof.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>
<div>By now there’s been a lot of discussion in the media about the <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/08/investigating-mitt-romney-offshore-accounts">Vanity Fair </a>and <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_ROMNEY_OFFSHORE_COMPANY?SITE=AP&#038;SECTION=HOME&#038;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT">Associated Press</a> exposés of Romney’s and his wife’s offshore bank accounts, to the limited extent that information about them is publicly available.  Romney is now likening overseas bank accounts and shell/money-laundering corporations to investing in real overseas companies—as if investments in overseas companies guarantee profit rather than loss in the same way that Bain and its executives usually were guaranteed profits, through financial-transaction fees and “consulting” fees they arranged for themselves irrespective of whether the acquisitioned company made money or instead collapsed under the weight of the debt Bain forced it to incur, in large part, in order to pay Bain those fees.  And as if personal profits from overseas investments aren’t taxable here in the United States unless those profits are stored in bank accounts elsewhere. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney’s refusal to disclose enough specifics about these foreign bank accounts, where the money actually came from and under what circumstances, and how it has been invested gives new meaning to the term “private equity,” at least in Romney’s case.  And this refusal, too, has been and will continue to be widely discussed.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But there’s one aspect of the investigative reports that I think has not been given enough attention and analysis: that Romney’s IRA account from his 15 years as CEO of Bain Capital—a period of time when annual IRA investments could be no more than $2,000—now has assets of more than $100 million.  The Vanity Fair article quotes an expert that the author consulted as saying he believes that they only way that this could have happened would be if Romney significantly undervalued the actual value of the assets he was placing into that account.  Paul Krugman in his New York Times column on Monday <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/09/opinion/krugman-mitts-gray-areas.html?partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss&#038;gwh=D4F69181C0C63375A5CFB3EA0A6E0E94">discussed </a>the IRA and said there were conceivable legal ways to accomplish this but, because of the secrecy, no way for the public to know whether these wealth was accumulated legally or not. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Krugman didn’t discuss how this could have happened legally, so I’m wondering: what kinds of investments would there have to have been for this money to have so wildly metastasized?  Apple stock?  If so, how <i>much</i> Apple stock?  Precious-metal funds?  A quiet Louvre heist? 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But there’s another issue concerning Romney’s and Bain’s peculiar brand of investment—this one involving the <i>real</i>definition of private equity, not the pun one I used in the title of this post—that also hasn’t received enough media attention: the difference between Bain-style private equity and Silicon Valley-style venture capital.  That difference being the one I alluded to above regarding the investor’s forcing the invested-in company to borrow large sums from banks and use some of the borrowed money or some of its profits to pay huge fees to the investor.  Or, in Bain’s case, apparently, not to all the investors, just to the investment company itself and to its executives—thus eliminating, for them, the usual risk inherent in capitalist investment.  You know; the risk so vaunted by <i>uber</i>-capitalist-advocates like Romney.  Not to mention Romney himself. </div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Slate writer Will Oremus has <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/future_tense/2012/07/11/solyndra_abound_solar_a123_how_the_doe_is_not_like_a_vc_firm.html">an article</a> there today in which he argues that the real difference between the federal government as an angel investor in startups such as Solyndra and private venture capitalists is that the former can only recoup its investment, while the latter can make substantial—sometimes huge—profits.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But venture capitalists, unlike Bain and its executives, also can lose all or some of their investment, just as the government can.  ((Does Andreesson Horwitz load up the startups it invests in with huge bank debt and use some of the loan money to pay the venture capitalist firm huge financial-transaction and consulting fees?)*  Just as there&#8217;s a difference between Silicon Valley-type venture capitalism and Bain-style private equity—something that Obama should <i>point out</i>—there&#8217;s a difference between making off like a bandit and being one.</div>
<div>
<p>
<div>&#8212;-
</p>
</div>
<p>
<div></div>
<div>UPDATE: Well, as implied in my reply to a comment below, I was unaware that Romney was the sole owner of Bain; I thought Bain was a closely-held corporation in which Romney was the main, but not the sole, shareholder.  But a jaw-dropping Boston Globe investigative report today, titled “Mitt Romney stayed at Bain 3 years longer than he stated,” makes clear—among, um, other things—that Romney was the sole owner of Bain.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>ALSO: On the subject of what types of investments Romney would have to have placed in his Bain-years IRA in order for it to have gained so much wealth, I just emailed Paul Krugman at his Princeton email address, told him about my post and about the speculation in the comments by Mike and Kaleberg, and asked whether he could write on his blog or even in his column about the various possibilities.  So … we’ll see ….</p>
