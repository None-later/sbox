<blockquote>We have discovered that sometime after January of this year, the FEC deleted a whole set of contributions totaling millions of dollars made during the 2007-2008 election cycle. The most important of these files concern what is now called “dark money” – funds donated to ostensible charities or public interest groups rather parties, candidates or conventional political action committees (PACs). These non-profit groups – which Washington insiders often refer to generically as 501(c)s, after the section of the federal tax code regulating them – use the money to pay for allegedly educational “independent” ads that run outside conventional campaign channels. Such funding has now developed into a gigantic channel for evading disclosure of the donors’ identities and is acutely controversial.</p>

<div>Lost in the shuffle here is the question of what it is Romney is denying he&#8217;s responsible for. Stipulate that Romney somehow had nothing to do with running a company of which he was the CEO and sole shareholder. Does he think, in retrospect, that his subordinates did something wrong by offshoring jobs? Clearly he didn&#8217;t, which highlights the absurdity of his claims not to have been responsible. It&#8217;s true that he wasn&#8217;t running the country [<i>sic</i>] on a day-to-day basis, but he really was titular CEO and had Bain been doing something he deemed outrageous he could and should have stepped in to stop them. But he doesn&#8217;t believe that. And what&#8217;s more,<i> </i><em>all indications are that Barack Obama also doesn&#8217;t think Bain was doing anything wrong</em>. [Emphasis in original.] As president he&#8217;s made no moves to make it illegal for companies to shift production work abroad and has publicly associated himself with a wide range of American firms—from GE to Apple and beyond—who&#8217;ve done just that to varying extents. And we all remember what happened to Obama&#8217;s promise to renegotiate NAFTA after taking office, right?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In my view both Obama and Romney are quite right about this. I&#8217;ll say more on this during the workweek, but one quick test is do you think there&#8217;s something immoral about the fact that Toyota and BMW have manufacturing facilities located in the United States? Should the Japanese and German governments be stopping Japan- and Germany-based firms from locating production offshore?

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I posted a comment to it, saying:
</p>
</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>Well, when Obama starts claiming that one of his key qualifications for reelection is that he’s helped create jobs in China—or when Romney starts saying that Bain invested in companies that specialized in moving jobs overseas in exchange for promises by German and Japanese companies to open, or keep, factories in this country—Yglesias’s equivalency argument might be less ridiculous. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>One of Obama’s spot-on arguments against Romney’s claim that his Bain experience was a successful jobs-creation experience rather than merely a successful wealth-creation-for-investors experience is that there’s a huge difference between experience in creating wealth for private investors, by any means available and at whatever expense to others, and creating good for the country’s overall economy and general welfare.  This offshoring issue is a classic case in point. Setting aside whether the federal government has the legal authority to prohibit private companies from offshoring—and I don’t think the government has any such legal authority, except in certain limited national security or foreign policy circumstances—there’s an obvious critical difference between not trying to stop this country’s companies from offshoring, for fear of retribution by other countries’ companies, similar to trying to avoid a tariff war, and aggressively aiding offshoring by American companies irrespective of any up-side for the general American economy. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Add to that that, as several other commenters have pointed out, the German and Japanese companies that offshore in this country do so mainly in manufacturing products or parts for products that will be sold in North America, mostly in this country.  GM, Ford, Chrysler and some U.S. auto-components manufacturing companies have factories in Europe, but the products and components made there are sold in Europe.  Like the German and Japanese auto companies that Yglesias equates with Bain’s offshoring-specialist companies, the American auto-industry companies continue to make the parts and cars sold in their home country in factories in their home country. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which, of course, would not be the case any longer had the Bush and Obama administrations taken Romney’s advice and let Detroit fail.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That said—and for the same reasons—Yglesias is wrong in saying that unless Romney thinks there’s something wrong with offshoring, it’s absurd for him to deny responsibility for Bain’s investments in offshoring-specialist companies during the three-year period beginning in early 1999.  If in fact Romney was no longer associated with Bain during that period, he would have every right to correct the record, whether or not he thinks there was anything wrong with what Bain did during that time.  But the question of whether Bain did anything wrong in investing in offshoring-specialist companies—during the period between 1993 and 1999, when (at least as I understand it) it apparently was doing so at Romney’s clear behest, or during the following three years—depends on what is meant by “wrong.” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It was not illegal.  But many voters think that, while it clearly was helpful to Bain’s investors and to Romney (who has continued since then to receive large payments from Bain), it was not helpful to the larger American economy and to the middle class.  It did not create jobs in this country; instead, it eliminated them.  And Romney is running for president virtually entirely on his claimed credential of being a jobs creator and of knowing how to create jobs—in America.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’m <a href="http://www.destinyland.org/when_she_was_good.htm">hesitant to be too critical of Yglesias</a> for his rather obvious conflations here.  He was, after all, not just the first pundit but also one of the very few even yet to point out a stunning, absolutely <i>jaw-dropping</i>proposition of law stated by <i>four of the nine</i> Supreme Court justices in their joint dissent late last month in the Affordable Care Act case, the part of the dissent concerning the issue of the severability of the part of the Medicaid provision in the Act that the Court’s majority struck down, in which the dissenters, while claiming that the majority was rewriting the Medicaid provision in order to save much of it, wanted to rewrite, rather dramatically, the Constitution’s separation of powers between Congress and the Court. Only four hours after the release of the opinion, when almost no one except the journalists covering the Court had yet read the dissent, Yglesias <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/06/28/why_the_dissenters_thought_dentist_deregulation_was_unconstitutional.html">wrote</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As I&#8217;ve noticed previously, there&#8217;s lots of other stuff in the Affordable Care Act besides the new regulation of insurance companies, including a move to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/06/26/the_affordable_care_act_vs_the_dentists_cartel.html">deregulate dental services</a>. So I was curious to see why the dissenters in the Supreme Court thought that not only was the individual mandate and the provisions related to the individual mandate unconstitutional, but also all this other stuff.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The answer is that they appear to have made up a new Christmas Tree Doctrine under which legitimate acts of Congress are held null and void if Antonin Scalia thinks they were part of some kind of unseemly horse-trading:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Some provisions, such as requiring chain restaurants to display nutritional content, appear likely to operate as Congress intended, but they fail the second test for severability. There is no reason to believe that Congress would have enacted them independently. The Court has not previously had occasion to consider severability in the context of an omnibus enactment like the ACA, which includes not only many provisions that are ancillary to its central provisions but also many that are entirely unrelated—hitched on because it was a quick way to get them passed despite opposition, or because their proponents could exact their enactment as the quid pro quo for their needed support. When we are confronted with such a so called “Christmas tree,” a law to which many nongermane ornaments have been attached, we think the proper rule must be that when the tree no longer exists the ornaments are superfluous. We have no reliable basis for knowing which pieces of the Act would have passed on their own. It is certain that many of them would not have, and it is not a proper function of this Court to guess which.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That all seems fine except I would have thought it was the prelude to the <i>opposite</i> ruling. It&#8217;s not the proper function of the court to guess why different provisions were enacted, just to rule on the constitutionality of laws. Since there&#8217;s plainly no constitutional problem with regulating interstate chain restaurants, the law is the law until Congress repeals the law. Instead, Justices Scalia, Alito, Kennedy, and Thomas have decided that rather than pick and choose it would be better to strike everything.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>This is far, far more newsworthy than the teensy bit of attention it has received suggests.  Four Supreme Court justices think legislative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling">logrolling</a> is improper and that therefore the Court can strike down full pieces of legislation that a majority of justices don’t like whenever they decide that some provision, however small, in the full piece of legislation is unconstitutional.  After all, y’know, maybe the rest of the legislation would not have been enacted without the <i>quid pro quo</i> votes.  Presumably, this also would apply to state laws as well as to federal laws—but, of course, as with federal laws, only to laws that the conservatives don’t like.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>I’d been meaning to write about this truly radical part of the dissent in the ACA case, but hadn’t gotten around to it.  Now I have.</p>

<blockquote>When you say that the high income earners, the top 20 percent, pay 90 percent of the taxes, what should they pay, 99 percent? These are the people who have enough money to invest in businesses and to create jobs.” The tax increase that Obama is proposing “falls directly on those job creators,” Senator Kyl said.&#8221; <i><a href="http://nbcpolitics.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/07/15/12753063-can-us-economy-tolerate-a-tax-increase-in-2013?lite">Can U.S. economy tolerate a tax increase in 2013?</a></i></p></blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of the upper quintile in Household Taxable Income does not make >$250,000 in AGI. Yet since 2001, the Republicans would have us believe that 3% of the taxpayers are the same as 20% of the taxpayers and that quintile makes > than $250,000. It is a lie and Senator Kyl needs to retract his blathering. </p>
<p>What is laughable about Senator Kyl statement is the Speaker of the House repudiates his statement here:<br />BOB SCHIEFFER: Do you quarrel with that figure? Is that a right figure or a wrong figure? </p>
<p>BOEHNER: Well, it may be three percent, but it&#8217;s half of small business income. Because, obviously, the top three percent have half of the gross income for those companies that we would term small businesses. And this is why you don&#8217;t want to punish these people at a time when you have a weak economy. <i></i><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/09/boehner_concedes_only_three_pe.html"><i>Boehner concedes only three percent of small businesses affected by extending tax cuts.</i></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>3% = 20%? Not likely and this is another example of the Republicans attempting to confuse the taxpayers. Even &#8220;<i>Joe- The-Plumber</i>&#8221; got it wrong; but then, why would a plumber have any greater knowledge then a Senator? At least there is an excuse for Joe.</p>
<p>So would taxing the upper 3% of the Taxable Household Incomes more hurt the economy? Not likely and it would correct the 2001/2003 skewing of taxes to this income group by President George Bush. What Bush did is without precedent in political history and is something not even Hoover attempted.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I generally agree with Paul Krugman, so it is exiting that I am outraged by something he wrote (I&#8217;ve calmed down now).</p>
<p>Paul Krugman says that scratchpads are useful.  They are sloppy easy models which are not taken seriously.  Or maybe which shouldn&#8217;t be taken seriously, but it&#8217;s not a big problem that many powerful people take them literally.  I lose my temper.</p>
<blockquote><p>IS-LM isn’t the prime example of a scratchpad. What is?</p>
<p>The answer is, supply and demand.</p>
<p>It is not easy to derive supply and demand curves for an individual good from general equilibrium with rational consumers blah blah. And it’s definitely not easy to justify consumer and producer surplus as measures of welfare. And there have always been some purists who condemn any use of the S and D curves we all grew up with, the use of triangles to measure welfare loss, and all that.</p>
<p>But for the most part nobody pays attention. The supply-and-demand framework is so convenient, while pretty much getting at what you want to get at, that it’s what almost everyone uses to get a first-pass analysis of economic issues.</p>
<p>Which is perfectly fine as long as you keep the limitations of the scratchpad in mind.</p></blockquote>
<p>No it isn&#8217;t !!! It is perfectly fine so long as you and all the people who read or skim what you right keep the limitations in mind.  What is in, say, Krugman&#8217;s mind can&#8217;t protect us from people who don&#8217;t have those limitations in their mind.</p>
<p>Before I really get going, I note the first example of a scratch pad IS-LM.  Here many people (including Jeff Sachs) think Krugman argues that fiscal stimulus is always a good approach to disappointing growth.  In fact, Krugman argues that monetary policy is better except when the economy is in a liquidity trap.  Policy makers forgetting what Krugman remembers but doesn&#8217;t always stress about the limitations of IS-LM will lead to trouble.  The fact that Krugman knows what Krugman thinks won&#8217;t protect us.</p>
<p>OK so he also has some use for supply and demand curves.  Here there is a problem.  Economists know that the assumed slopes of curves based on utility maximisation is just one possibility.  Basic micro includes the explanation of substitution effects and income effects.  But policy makers generally act as if there are no income effects.  The fact that economists know about them doesn&#8217;t make policy better.</p>
<p>The thing which outraged me (I&#8217;m calm now) is the reference to the sum of consumer and producer surplus as a measure of welfare.  This makes sense so long as the distribution of income has no effect on welfare.  Of course Krugman doesn&#8217;t think that or else he wouldn&#8217;t have written the post immediately below.  The idea that inequality is not a negligible problem should not be confined to purists.  The idea that economic analysis and economic efficiency are based on consumer surplus plus producer surplus is extremely powerful and damaging.</p>
<p>What economists keep in mind doesn&#8217;t matter much.  What matters is what is in policy makers&#8217; minds.  The habit of treating consumer plus producer surplus as welfare while keeping the fact that it isn&#8217;t in mind has done vast damage.</p>

                                <p>Nothing really new here, for some reason I ended up wandering back to this <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/red-states-sucking-the-federal-teat.html">old post</a> of mine, and &#8212; partially because the video at the end so kicks ass &#8212; can&#8217;t resist re-posting it over here for those who haven&#8217;t seen it.<br />
<h2>Red States Sucking the Federal Teat</h2>
<p>Just a reminder for all those red-state debt-ceiling hawks out there.</p>
<p>Here’s where the debt came from:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2011/08/americas-fiscal-union?fsrc=scn/tw/te/dc/theredandtheblack"><img alt="" height="462" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/20110806_WOM959_0.gif" width="595"></a></p>
<p>How do you think state budgets would look if all those in-the-red red states had to pay back all the federal money they’ve gotten from the prosperous blue states?</p>
<p>Look at Mississippi. Oh, I mean Greece. Oh no, I mean Mississippi.</p>
<p>Start this at 3:00:</p>

                                <p>I hesitate to excerpt from this because it says it all so well and so briefly. But:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>…the more taxes the US government collects, the more money it loses.</p>
<p>When the US government declines to sell a 10 year Treasury bill at a real rate interest rate of –0.57 percent it is agreeing to pay, to the bond market a fixed rate of 0.57 percent over the next ten years. …</p>
<p>Now you say, sure but interest rates can turn [on] you. And, they absolutely can. But, at minimum you must recognize that you are arguing that the US government enter into an interest rate swap with the Global Financial system because [<del>you that]</del> <strong>your intuition about the path of interest rates is superior to that of the Global Bond Market. </strong>…</p>
<p>And, be aware, the Counterparty in this swap is folks like Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley, and yes Barclay Capital.</p>
<p>Are you sure that you want to buy this swap?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I noticed that the notion of income inequality and consequences was described outside the box in this article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/us/two-classes-in-america-divided-by-i-do.html?emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y">NYT</a>.  Several ideas struck me about the article.  How people can work side by side with such little connection in their lives is instructive.  The sense of &#8216;commons&#8217; is missing from the article could be instructive in high lighting how the two women see their obligations and options, but another follow up could help instruct  us.  We tend to act on our own perceived stories&#8217; to determine these choices. :</p>
<blockquote><p>But a friendship that evokes parity by day becomes a study of inequality at night and a testament to the way family structure deepens class divides. Ms. Faulkner is married and living on two paychecks, while Ms. Schairer is raising her children by herself. That gives the Faulkner family a profound advantage in income and nurturing time, and makes their children statistically more likely to finish college, find good jobs and form stable marriages. </p>
<p>The economic storms of recent years have raised concerns about growing inequality and questions about a core national faith, that even Americans of humble backgrounds have a good chance of getting ahead. Most of the discussion has focused on labor market forces like falling blue-collar wages and lavish Wall Street pay. </p>
<p>But striking changes in family structure have also broadened income gaps and posed new barriers to upward mobility.</p></blockquote>
<p>The advantage of comparing is to personalize and give life to &#8216;trends&#8217; in our social fabric. The disadvantage of using real examples  is that readers may trivialize the significance of a trend by making pronouncements on individual morality and choices and not look at real trends.  Often little is offered for the psychological reasons for choices other than &#8220;shoulda known better&#8221;.  Individual choices are of course tremendously important, but fail to explain the much larger trends. </p>
<p>The significant growing necessity of having two paychecks to raise a family is mentioned, and also the type of jobs women tend to get at lower pay compounding the difficulty of making enough money. Also mentioned is Ronald Reagan&#8217;s earned income credit to help alleviate what could have been much more severe poverty. There was no mention of medicaid, and no mention of what state the two women lived in. Not mentioned is the profound decrease in the labor participation rate for male &#8216;blue collar&#8217; workers and subsequent dislocations  (lower wages for men were given slight mention).</p>
<p>One important  thought is that a significant number of people have dropped out of the &#8216;middle class&#8217;.  </p>

<p>Guest post: The Romney job record in Massachusetts</p>
<p>For the period January 2003 – January 2007, the Romney record on state government job growth is compared against the national state employment aggregate. Likewise, private sector job growth in Massachusetts is compared against the national private sector aggregate, thus, benchmarking the Romney record against the national record.</p>
<p>The comparisons make clear that state government employment increased 2.8% in Massachusetts, more than twice the national state government employment aggregate of 1.1%. Private sector employment over the same period in Massachusetts increased 1.4%, less than a quarter of the national aggregate of 5.9%. It should be noted that this comparative performance decrement mirrors economic growth in the state as annual real GDP grew 1.6% over Romney’s tenure, as opposed to an annual increase of 2.7% nationally.</p>

<p>Toward a Supreme Court Showdown<br />
<blockquote>Six federal courts have ruled on the Defense of Marriage Act and reached the same conclusion: the 1996 law violates the Constitution by denying same-sex couples, who are legally married under state law, federal benefits afforded to heterosexual couples for no good reason. The issue has now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/us/an-unexpected-alliance-in-a-same-sex-marriage-case.html">officially landed at the Supreme Court</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, the Obama administration asked the justices to review two court decisions — one by <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/10-2204P-01A.pdf">the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> and one by <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/02/another-court-finds-defense-of-marriage-act-unconstitutional-115243.html">a Federal District Court in San Francisco</a> — striking down the law’s denial of benefits on equal protection grounds. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Jonathan Chait <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2012/07/whats-true-and-false-in-obamas-bain-attacks.html">argues</a> both that the debate about Romney and Bain is idiotic and he participates in it.  His contribution is definitely idiotic if he is right that the debate is stupid.  It is also idiotic if it isn&#8217;t stupid, because he ignored what is true and what is false when writing about what is true and what is false.  The problem is that he assumes that the Romney campaign told at most one lie and not an irrelevant lie to distract attention from publicly reported facts.</p>
<p>There is a big debate about whether Romney has any responsibility for things Bain did from February 11 1999 until 2002 &#8212; a period when he was sole shareholder, Chairman of the board, CEO and President.  (many have remarked that Romney doesn&#8217;t really want to convince us that he believes that being President doesn&#8217;t involve taking any responsibility).  There is much less debate about whether this is relevant to the Romney campaign&#8217;s claim that there is no evidence that Romney managed investment in outsourcers.  But he did that well before 1999.  One controversy has distracted Chait (among others) from a demonstrable flat out lie.</p>

<p>I note that you equate &#8220;not proven&#8221; with false.  Even if you are right that the Obama campaign can&#8217;t prove all of its claims beyond all doubt doesn&#8217;t mean that you should say their claims are false.</p>
<p>Notably, you argue that the debate about when Romney stopped managing Bain is a &#8220;nonsense argument&#8221; and then vigorously participate in that argument writing &#8220;Bain Capital did those things after Romney stopped running the company.&#8221;  </p>
<p>No.  You can claim that the topic is pointless nonsense or you can make a definite claim, but not both.  You don&#8217;t like the Obama campaigns approach &#8212; pointless and false both feel bad, but you should be able to distinguish your feelings from your assessment of objective fact.</p>
<p>Also your claim of fact is unquestionably false.  The reason is that, well before 1999, Bain invested in firms which offshored.</p>
<p>I quote from the un-retracted Washington Post story <br />http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/romneys-bain-capital-invested-in-companies-that-moved-jobs-overseas/2012/06/21/gJQAsD9ptV_story_1.html</p>
<p>&#8220;Bain’s foray into outsourcing began in 1993 when the private equity firm took a stake in Corporate Software Inc., or CSI, after helping to finance a $93 million buyout of the firm. CSI, which catered to technology companies like Microsoft, provided a range of services including outsourcing of customer support. Initially, CSI employed U.S. workers to provide these services but by the mid-1990s was setting up call centers outside the country.</p>
<p>Two years after Bain invested in the firm, CSI merged with another enterprise to form a new company called Stream International Inc. Stream immediately became active in the growing field of overseas calls centers. Bain was initially a minority shareholder in Stream and was active in running the company, providing “general executive and management services,” according to SEC filings.&#8221;</p>
<p>How do you reconcile these facts publicly reported in a not so obscure newspaper withh your claim that &#8221; &#8220;Bain Capital did those things after Romney stopped running the company.&#8221;  ?  I ask for information and will interpret a failure to respond as a confession that this post is totally incorrect. </p>
<p>Look decide if you think a debate is pointless or if you are going to jump into it.  Otherwise you make a fool of yourself as you did with this post.</p>
