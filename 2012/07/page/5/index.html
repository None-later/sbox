<div></div>
<div>I can’t help but think that Romney’s newly invigorated crony-capital (e.g., Solyndra) schtick is very much a double-edged sword for him.  I mean, isn’t he the candidate who, notwithstanding his claimed concern about the federal deficit, refuses to support the proposed elimination of the federal government’s subsidies to the oil and gas industry, and who (as per a speech he gave last winter in, I think, Utah) wants the federal government to sell most of the national forest and park land to the logging industry because, well, the public doesn’t need those forests and parks?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or am I mistaken in thinking that the Koch brothers <a href="http://exiledonline.com/a-people-history-of-koch-industries-part-ii-libertarian-billionaires-charles-and-david-koch-are-closetcase-subsidy-kings-who-milk-big-government-tyranny-but-want-to-slash-spending-on-anyone-else/">have vast oil, gas and logging interests</a>—and that the brothers contribute heavily to Romney, his super PACs and other Republican fundraising groups?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or that Romney’s proposal to tie the level of his proposed increases in Defense spending to the level of annual GDP output, rather than, y’know, this country’s national defense needs—might have something to do with crony capitalism?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Not even to mention a stunningly perverse pinstriped-patronage version of Keynsian economics.  Okay, I’ll mention it:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney&#8217;s plan calls for linking the Pentagon&#8217;s base budget to Gross Domestic Product, and allowing the military to spend at least $4 dollars out of every $100 the American economy produces.”
</p>
</div>
<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/10/news/economy/romney-defense-spending/index.htm">Defense spending to spike $2.1 trillion under Romney</a></i>, CNN Money, May 10, 2012.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Been wondering when this interesting little policy proposal, and its obvious purpose, would start to get some national media attention.  There’s no time like the present.  Not that our blog is a national media outlet.  But we can pretend.

<div>A key but seriously underemphasized factor in the near-collapse of the financial system and economy in 2008 was the role that the two largest securities-ratings firms, Moody’s and Standard and Poors, played: The two agencies routinely and deliberately overrated the value of mortgage-backed securities. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So I was momentarily (and naively) stunned to read this morning the specifics of the highly-publicized Ernst and Young report released yesterday claiming that Obama’s main tax proposal could cause the loss of 710,00 jobs. A Yahoo! News <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/white-house-blasts-study-critical-obama-tax-plan-214215322.html">article </a>summarizes:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>On the official White House blog, senior Obama economic policy aide Jason Furman ripped the new study. Among his complaints:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8211;       The report, funded by pro-business groups generally hostile to Obama&#8217;s agenda, assumes that none of the revenue generated by raising taxes on the richest Americans goes to deficit reduction. Instead, it assumes the money would go to expanding government spending. But the president has called for the money to go to reducing the federal deficit and national debt.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8211;       The report omits Obama&#8217;s push for new tax cuts to spur private-sector hiring and investment. By ignoring the predicted impact on jobs growth, Furman argued, the study distorts the impact of the president&#8217;s agenda.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The article goes on to say that “Furman, whose title is Principal Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, also charged that the study&#8217;s conclusions are ‘dramatically out-of-line with estimates by other analysts’ like the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the non-partisan standard for judging the economic impact of federal legislation.”  Furman also noted that the proposal would restore tax rates to their Clinton-era level, a time of significant jobs creation.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Good grace.  Ernst and Young is not an ideological think tank.  Not openly, anyway.  It is instead one of the very largest and most prestigious accounting firms in the world, and, like Moody’s and Standard and Poors, is relied upon by securities investors and merger-and-acquisition folks for honest evaluation of corporate value and the like in SEC filings and private deal-making. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It also is generally considered a proverbial gold-standard firm in preparing tax documents for corporations and (wealthy) individuals.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which brings me to the subject of the IRS.  Needless to say, the IRS’s investigatory powers <i>cannot</i> be used for political purposes.  For the most basic and obvious reasons, that would be illegal; it would undermine democracy itself.  (See, e.g., Richard Nixon; Watergate.)  But if this firm is simply altering or removing relevant facts from its computations in order to meet a client’s pre-calculation demand—which apparently is what happened in this instance—its very credibility is so undermined that the firm’s identification on IRS, or for that matter securities, documents, as having played a role in the preparation of the document, should begin to raise red flags for the relevant government agencies.  And for anyone reading a securities prospectus or considering the purchase of, or investment in, a particular business.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>There’s simply a limit to the extent to which relevant facts can be manipulated or discounted and still have the financial representations not amount to fraud.  In the case of this Ernst and Young report, it’s fraud, but not illegal fraud.  But that’s only because the report itself was not part of a securities or IRS filing or some other financial transaction.

<p>What&#8217;s Romney Got to Hide? It&#8217;s past time for financial and tax transparency</p>
<p>As everybody who has followed anything about this election cycle knows, Mitt Romney&#8211;likely the wealthiest man to run for president, the only bankster/private equity fund founder (sole shareholder, CEO and manager) to run for president, and probably the only person with multiple multi-million dollar accounts stashed away in tax havens like Bermuda, Cayman Islands and Swiss banks to run for president&#8211;still thinks the kinds of information that one can glean from full disclosure of tax returns isn&#8217;t relevant to his attempt to gain the presidency.  He has reiterated his refusal to release more than the 2010 and (estimated, at this point) 2011 returns.</p>
<p>Yet there are many questions voters can legitimately ask about Romney&#8217;s finances and tax returns, questions that cannot be answered with certainty without seeing multiple years of returns.  Let&#8217;s consider the most obvious ones.</p>
<p>1. Offshoring of assets:   It is clear from the paucity of return information we do have that the Romneys hold a considerable portion of their assets offshore.  It is not unreasonable to wonder why someone who desires to be President of the US would find it necessary or even reasonable to put so much of his (or their) assets offshore, taking them out of the US.  Clearly, offshore assets are harder to trace, harder to account for, and possibly easier to hide from tax administrators but one would certainly hope that wouldn&#8217;t be the reason behind a very wealthy candidate&#8217;s use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_bank">offshore accounts</a>.  Just as clearly, the fact of offshore multimillion dollar accounts does not establish tax avoidance, since Romney could be appropriately reporting and paying taxes on all of his foreign holdings.  Yet the fact that it is not illegal per se to hold assets offshore begs the question that does count&#8211; why is he holding so much in offshore accounts?  What&#8217;s the benefit to him?  If he is as patriotic as he claims, why doesn&#8217;t he show that by putting his assets in the US, in essence &#8220;putting his money where his mouth is&#8221;?  If he can&#8217;t clearly explain to voters what the reasonable benefit to him is of having assets stashed offshore, then voters may draw the conclusion that he has something to hide.</p>
<p>2. Hobby horses?:  Like many of the ultra wealthy, the Romneys have enough money to engage in whatever pastimes and pleasures they like&#8211;they can own an expensive horse, arrange for it to be pastured and cared for near one of their many multimillion-dollar residences, and even ship it overseas (costing tens of thousands of dollars) for participation in sporting events.  The question this raises for ordinary Americans is how do the Romneys treat this activity on their tax returns, and is that treatment justifiable under the rules? </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There are rules for activities that are &#8220;not engaged in for profit&#8221; under section 183 (generally called the hobby loss provision), that allow participants to deduct hobby expenses only to the extent of income from the hobby activity.  Activities engaged in for profit include active conduct of businesses and investment activities.  Everything else falls under this hobby provision, which amounts to a truly generous provision for mostly wealthy households who can afford to buy expensive toys that allow them to sometimes earn related income&#8211;Ie, this provision covers consumption that one engages in for personal enjoyment rather than for the potential profits.  There is a test requiring profits in 3 out of 5 years  (4 out of 7 for activities involving horses) to escape the hobby provision.  So voters can rightly wonder whether the Romney&#8217;s treat their costs for their horseshow competitions as a business.  (This is the same question tax experts had about <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/hobby-losses-section-183-benefits-the-wealthy.html">Todd Palin</a>&#8216;s claim that his snowmobile racing was a business even though there appeared to be a good deal of circumstancial evidence that it was instead merely a pleasurable sports activity/hobby.)   To know whether not treating such activities as hobbies under section 183 is correct, one needs to see at least 5 consecutive years of tax returns:  there simply is insufficient information without that. </p>
<p>3.  Passive activities?  The same type of activities that raise questions about the categorization as hobby or business/investment also potentially raise questions about the passive activity rules. Section 469 limits the ability of taxpayers to use &#8220;passive activity losses&#8221; against other income, such as that from businesses actively conducted by the taxpayer (including salaries from the business of being an employee).  Generally, losses from passive investments are &#8220;schedularized&#8221;, meaning that they are generally allowed only against passive income (there are exceptions).  It would be useful, again, to see multiple years of returns in order to reach a comfortable conclusion about the way the Romneys&#8217; various activities fall within these rules (or not).  </p>
<p>4. Retirement accounts?  One question making waves is how a retirement account for which strict contribution limitations apply could possibly have a value of more than $100 million today if only about $30,000 of assets was put in just a decade ago.  See, e.g., Felix Salmon, Opinion: Did Romney put Bain Capital shares in his IRA? Reuters, July 16, 2012 (noting comments by Bill Cohan, Nicholas Shaxson).  We all know that our retirement accounts (generally created with cash contributions from our salaries) have tended to lose money, not gain&#8211;and certainly most Americans&#8217; retirement accounts haven&#8217;t gained at those astronomical levels.  So voters could reasonably ask what assets were added to that account that could have increased in worth so significantly in such a short period of time.  Without the release and more disclosure of such information, voters might reasonably be suspicious that assets were knowingly undervalued upon being added, with the knowledge that their actual fair market value would show significant amounts attributable to earnings within the account. </p>
<p>The Salmon article cited above mentions a theory that the retirement accounts were &#8220;pumped with risky A shares in Bain, that &#8220;often had aggressively low valuations when they were first issued&#8221; and could &#8220;create issues at an IRS audit.&#8221;   Salmon proposes instead that Romney loaded his IRAs  with his own shares in Bain, of which he remained sole owner and CEO until 2002.  Salmon seems to be suggesting it was not just at the beginning, when he could likely reasonably claim a zero value, but annually thereafter:  he notes that &#8220;Romney would have had every incentive to keep the official valuation of Bain Capital low for many years, since the lower Bain Capital was wroth, the more of it he could put into his retirement accounts every year.  Again, the IRS might well be interested in the valuation techniques Romney used for  the purposes of his retirement account contributions.  And then &#8230; when Romney left Bain, he would have switched from minimizing Bain Capital&#8217;s official value to maximizing it.&#8221;  Id. </p>
<p>Another theory mentioned in the article is the tendency of investors in partnerships to undervalue interests when first putting them into an IRA, under the argument [labelled as &#8220;dubious&#8221; by Salmon, since all securities represent future income] that partnership interests merely represent future income, not current value.  Salmon notes that an &#8220;aggressive tax lawyer&#8221; might make such an approach &#8220;possible.&#8221;<br />It is likely that the retirement accounts were funded early on with Romney&#8217;s shares in Bain, before it was obvious for tax purposes that it would be a hugely profitable enterprise.  Thus, it would seem that Romney would benefit measurably from transparency here, since there is otherwise reasonable cause for continuing speculation about potential intentional undervaluations of contributed assets.</p>
<p>There are many other questions voters could reasonable explore about the way such an ultra wealthy presidential candidate shares the burden of taxation with ordinary voters, such as how much of Romney&#8217;s income is consistently earned in carried interest, dividends, and capital gains, all of which enjoy an extraordinarily favorable preferential tax rate under the Bush tax cuts, or how much of Romney&#8217;s income is outright excluded under generous tax expenditure provisions governing certain financial products purchased primarily (or exclusively) by the rich, such as muni bonds.  A voter might also like to see how the 1999 through 2002 tax returns show income from <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/tax-policy-center-on-cutting-tax-preferences-to-lower-tax-rates-aka-romneys-plan.html">Bain Capital</a>, during the period that Romney remained CEO and signed off on important SEC and tax documents but now claims he was retroactively retired and therefore completely out of the loop on the very deals and decisions he was signing off on.  (Would you want to invest in that business if you knew that about it at the time?) </p>
<p>Romney says he won&#8217;t release any more tax returns.  His adviser says no matter how many he released, it wouldn&#8217;t be enough.  See David Muir, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/romney-adviser-no-matter-how-many-tax-returns-romney-releases-it-wont-be-enough/">Romney Adviser: No Matter How Many Tax Returns</a>, ABC News.com (July 16, 2012).  That excuse for nonrelease is clearly just that&#8211;an excuse.  Nobody demands a lifetime of returns.  Romney&#8217;s father set a good precedent with 12 years, which would be especially reasonable here since it would show Romney&#8217;s returns for those disputed turn of the century years.  <br />Romney seems to be saying just &#8220;trust me&#8221; that everything is above board and everything filed correctly and that voters have no reason to be interested in any of the details of how he holds his assets or how he manages them or what he claims about his various activities on his tax returns. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s a little like his assertion that voters don&#8217;t have any reason to have questions about his &#8220;retroactive retirement&#8221; from Bain Capital, for which he signed federally required SEC and tax forms as sole shareholder and CEO for years after he now claims he had quit paying any attention to company decisions.  Clearly, voters should have an interest in assessing for themselves the extent of Romney&#8217;s offshoring, the way he has filed on his expensive hobbies, and whether those filings&#8211;even if they are entirely accurate, as hopefully they are&#8211; give him tax advantages that ordinary people have no access to.  </p>
<p>It is telling that even staunch right-winger George Will &#8220;slammed&#8221; Romney on this issue, saying &#8220;Romney &#8216;must have calculated that there are higher costs in releasing them.'&#8221; George Stephanopoulos, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/george-will-matthew-dowd-blast-romney-for-not-releasing-tax-returns/">George Will, Matthew Dowd Blast Romney for not Releasing Tax Returns</a>, ABC News.com (July 15, 2012).<br />After all, <strong>in 2008 McCain apparently requested&#8211;and received&#8211;two decades&#8217; worth of Romney tax returns as part of the Veep vetting process</strong>.  George Stephanopoulos, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/george-will-matthew-dowd-blast-romney-for-not-releasing-tax-returns/">George Will, Matthew Dowd Blast Romney for not Releasing Tax Returns</a>, ABC News.com, July 15, 2012 (noting that Romney reportedly provided 23 years of tax returns to the McCain campaign in 2008). </p>
<p>The fact that McCain commented today that his choice of Sarah Palin over Romney had nothing to do with anything on the returns but rather with Palin&#8217;s superior candidacy is irrelevant, since we cannot know whether the campaign could or did make a thorough analysis of those returns or how they weighed any issues they saw (or didn&#8217;t see).  See  <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/17/mccain-palin-was-better-vp-choice-than-romney-in-2008/">McCain: Palin was better VP choice than Romney in 2008</a>, CNN, July 17, 2012.   <strong>What any voter can reasonably say is this:  If it was reasonable for McCain to view more than a couple of years of tax returns to reach an assessment of potential issues that might affect the electibility of the man (presumably issues relating to character, honesty, business and investment skills, philosophy, and patriotism), then it is also reasonable for American voters to do the same.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-its-past-time-for-financial-and-tax-transparency.html">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-its-past-time-for-financial-and-tax-transparency.html</a></p>

The criticism was aimed at the OCC regulators who failed to pursue the issue.  Also notice the fuss is over a foreign bank.</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. affiliate of global banking giant HSBC was for years a haven for foreign money laundering, drug-trafficking money and potential terrorist financing activities, largely because of the bank’s woefully inadequate monitoring practices, according to a 340-page Senate report scheduled for release Tuesday. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The report chastises the bank’s primary U.S. regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, for failing to take more aggressive enforcement measures against the bank after the OCC became aware of illicit activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please save us from a Senate that cut the budget for an agency, and specifically for its enforcement arm by the head of the agency (mainly John Dugan&#8217;s watch), and who vigorously pushed deregulation and  federalization over state rules concerning consumers&#8230;and then wonders out loud why the &#8216;bad&#8217; guys aren&#8217;t dealt justice.</p>

<p><em>(Note: Paul Krugman cites <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/medicaid-zombies/">here</a>. Tyler Cowen responds <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/07/aaron-carroll-on-medicaid-wars.html">here</a>. I respond to Cowen’s response <a href="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/tyler-cowen-on-me-on-medicaid-wars/">here</a>.)</em></p>
<p>Tyler Cowen <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/business/medicaids-new-tug-of-war-economic-view.html">had a piece in the NYT</a> this weekend on Medicaid. He doesn’t seem too thrilled with its use in the ACA’s coverage expansion. </p>
<p>&#8230; I have to admit that his article set me off a bit. It could be that he didn’t have space in the NYT for more nuance. Perhaps he’ll provide it on his blog. In particular, I’d love him to address some of the points below…</p>
<p>I get a bit annoyed by blanket claims that doctors won’t accept Medicaid&#8230;.<br />I get a bit annoyed when people just claim government programs are “unpopular”&#8230;<br />I get a bit annoyed at the blanket acceptance of the awesomeness of the free market in health care, when there is no phenomenal evidence of its success&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Look, I get that people may not like the political implications of those systems. They may not like the governments that produce them. They may not like the <a href="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/reduced-spending-is-the-wrong-argument/">lack of choice</a>  inherent in such systems. They may not like the potential  limitations within them for making money, and therefore for innovation. But we need to stop making stuff up about them.</p></blockquote>

<div>Rules requiring firms to restrict employment to their country of origin would be hideously inefficient if applied on a global basis, and they would be every bit as devastating to American employees of foreign firms as offshoring by American firms is to workers who lose their jobs here. (One might also ask where the borders of corporate patriotism ought to be. If it’s wrong for a Michigan-based car company to have a supply chain that extends to Mexico, why is Ohio OK? After all, it hardly makes a difference to a laid-off worker where exactly his job went—the bad news is that he lost his job.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Over the long run, we’re all going to be more prosperous if we live in a world where firms are allowed to locate work where it’s most efficient to locate it. This is exactly why, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud3mMj0AZZk" target="_blank">despite some tough ads</a>, the Obama administration has not proposed any policies to restrict firms’ freedom to shift work across state or national boundaries.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney’s unwillingness to make the case for outsourcing reflects, in part, political timidity. But more broadly, it underscores that although he’s been an eager participant in contemporary capitalism, he’s not willing to mount a policy response to its vicissitudes.

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It’s surely true that rules requiring firms to restrict employment to their country of origin would be hideously inefficient if applied on a global basis, and they would be every bit as devastating to American employees of foreign firms as offshoring by American firms is to workers who lose their jobs here. </p>
<p>But, to my knowledge, the only one who’s equated the absence of* government policy (of necessity on this issue, statutes) that would restrict corporate employment to the country of the corporation’s origin, and a private equity firm’s investment in companies that specialize in assisting American corporations with offshoring employment, is Yglesias.  Even Romney apparently recognizes the distinction. Not sure why Yglesias doesn’t.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>It’s one thing to argue that utterly unfettered globalization of employment by corporations worldwide ultimately has a positive effect on the American economy—as Yglesias does. But it&#8217;s another thing entirely to actually convince a majority of the public that this is so even in light of current trends and actual facts. </div>
<div></div>
<div>And it’s one thing to argue that laws that forbid companies from relocating jobs from the company’s home country to another one would have a negative side to it because of possible retaliatory laws in other countries, and another thing to equate that with decisions by corporations themselves about whether to offshore or not. (And, setting aside the obvious constitutional bar to prohibiting a corporation’s relocation of jobs from one state to another, it’s a lot easier for families to relocate from Michigan to Ohio than from Michigan to Mexico.)</p>
<p>The thing that Yglesias doesn’t get is that Romney’s claiming that his private-sector career demonstrates his ability to create not just wealth for investors but jobs <i>en masse</i> for the public. There’s really no way for him to make that claim persuasively, because it plainly isn’t true. He can defend offshoring as a corporate strategy, but corporate strategy is a different matter than economic strategy.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, Romney wants to argue that encouraging offshoring by American corporations is good government policy. Hope he does.  But then, I&#8217;m a Democrat.

<p>Commenter rjs points us to <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/06/americas-fiscal-union">this depressing <em>Economist</em> post</a> — the government data source for this graphic has gone dark, part of the Obama administration’s cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>The real irony I discover, though, is to find right-wingers at The Heritage Foundation <a href="http://blog.heritage.org/2012/04/16/obama-administration-discontinues-transparency-tool/">screaming</a> about the Obama administration’s hypocrisy and opacity for cutting that budget item (which they would undoubtedly label “redundant” and “wasteful” if it <em>hadn’t</em> been cut).</p>
<blockquote><p>With the Obama Administration outspending all prior Administrations while adding to the astronomical federal debt, the fact that taxpayers can no longer rely on access to where and how their money is being spent at the county and city level is disquieting. So far, Administration officials have been able to brush the lack of transparency under the rug. For the good of the country, that needs to change. <strong>Citizens should demand to know what is happening to their tax dollars once they are sucked up by the federal government’s vacuum cleaner.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Indeed</strong> — including which states, exactly, are doing the sucking.</p>
<p>Another example:</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2012/07/17/Bubbles-and-Bailouts-Why-Some-Economists-Failed.aspx#page1"></a>I assert that some economists got things mostly right about the recession and what was needed to fix it, but they have been ignored in policy discussions. Conversely, those who got things mostly wrong were given prominent seats at the policy-setting table where they continued to make errant forecasts even as the evidence piled up against them. One attempt at rebuttal is, I suppose, is to ask how we know who was correct? The answer is that unlike the economists who continue to promote austerity, fear of inflation, and so on, the assertion is based upon the empirical evidence on these issues. [<a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/on-the-curious-persistence-of-inflationary-obsession/">See</a> Paul Krugman for a related issue, why fear of inflation, deficits, and so on &#8220;resonates with a lot of people no matter how often and how badly the worldview fails in practice.&#8221; Part of my point is that I don&#8217;t think economists are free of blame for this.]</p></blockquote>

<p>Health Care Thoughts: Employer Responses </p>
<p><a href="http://www.urban.org/publications/412428.html" target="_blank">The Urban Institute and the Robert Woods Johnson Foundation published a paper (October 2011)</a> about the potential responses of employers and employees. The paper tends to take an optimistic view on the responses of employers, although warning of possible short term thinking by some employers.  <br />Now the SCOTUS uproar is resolved, it was worth rereading.<br />    <br />My own view is slightly different, focusing on:    <br />1) Employers with high value employees will continue to provide benefits.    <br />2) Employers with lower value employees will scrutinize the options.    <br />3) Employer slightly below the 50 cutoff will not be hiring.    <br />4) Employers slightly above the 50 cutoff will look to cut employees.    <br />5) Some employers will try to build networks of independent contractors.<br />    <br />Read the UI paper, it is well written for a technical work.    </p>
