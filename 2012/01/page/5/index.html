<div>Political Opportunity (Not)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The link at the end of Steve Roth’s post yesterday, “<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/american-exceptionalism-238-opportunity.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">American Exceptionalism #238: Opportunity (Not)</a>,” is to a post on Sunday by Paul Krugman on his NYT blog, in which he discusses Alan Krueger’s speech last week.  Krugman’s blog entry says:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Alan Krueger, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers … gave a <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/events/2012/01/krueger.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">very informative speech</a> on inequality last week that should have received more press than it did. Much of it was stuff that inequality mavens already know, but he had one striking result that was what I suspected but hadn’t seen demonstrated: a clear negative relationship between inequality at a point in time and intergenerational social mobility.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Below is what he dubs the Great Gatsby Curve…. As he shows [using graphs], America is both especially unequal and has especially low mobility. But he also argues that because we are even more unequal now than we were a generation ago, we should expect even less social mobility going forward.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As everyone who discusses politics with me knows,  huge pet peeves of mine are Obama’s refusal to discuss specific facts, including statistics, in speeches to the public—and his failure even to speak to the public at all on substantive issues.  Exceptions are ridiculously rare.  But the campaign is about to start, and—who knows?—he might actually deign to occasionally speak in specifics and cite facts (including statistics) in order to refute the Republican mantras of anti-Keynesianism and anti-progressive tax codes.  Assuming, of course, that he agrees with his own Council of Economic Advisers chairman about the importance of the statistics, and recognizes the salience of those statistics with the public.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another pet peeve of mine is the silly meme of political pundits, such as Maureen Dowd, in which they repeatedly describe Obama as professorial—as if professors teach their classes by speaking in clichés and generics.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But even if Obama continues his personal policy of refusing to argue Democratic economics and tax policy and to use statistics to support the arguments, Democratic congressional candidates hopefully will be smart enough to mention the important statistics and discuss them.  I expect that Elizabeth Warren will be a model for them in this.  Hopefully they’ll take note and follow her lead.</div>

<p>Comments on Journalist Chris Hedges’ article, “Why I’m Suing Barack Obama”<br />(reformatted for easier reading) </p>
<p>Dan asked me if I could comment on an article published yesterday on Truthdig, republished on Truthout, by veteran foreign correspondent and current Truthdig columnist Chris Hedges.  The article is titled, “Why I’m Suing Barack Obama.”  Hedges’ Truthdig bio says he’s reported from combat zones in the far corners of the earth for, among other news organizations, the NY Times, the Christian Science Monitor, and NPR.  He won a Pulitzer in 2002 as part of a team of reporters for their reportage of global terrorism.</p>
<p>His article says that during the course of his journalism career he met with a slew of leaders of groups that the U.S. government considered terrorist outfits, and spent time with fighters in military operations of rebel armies such as armed units of the Sandinistas in Nicaragua.  His lawsuit, filed last week in federal district court in New York City, challenges the constitutionality of two sections of the National Defense Authorization Act, which Obama signed on Dec. 31.<br />Hedges explains:  <br />
<blockquote>The act authorizes the military in Title X, Subtitle D, entitled “Counter-Terrorism,” for the first time in more than 200 years, to carry out domestic policing. With this bill, which will take effect March 3, the military can indefinitely detain without trial any U.S. citizen deemed to be a terrorist or an accessory to terrorism. And suspects can be shipped by the military to our offshore penal colony in Guantanamo Bay and kept there until “the end of hostilities.” It is a catastrophic blow to civil liberties.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />In the article, Hedges excoriates cowardly Democratic members of Congress who supported (or at least voted for) the insertion of those provisions into the Defense Department’s budget bill, and Obama for signing the legislation.  He also speculates that the real reason that Republicans proposed those sections, and that some Democrats voted for it and Obama signed it has little to do with threats from al-Qaeda and its likes.  The real purpose of the bill, he suspects, given the current crippled state of the fading al Qaeda, and the breathtakingly imprecise definitions of key words in the legislation, and therefore the law’s potential for elastic use, is to thwart internal domestic movements that threaten the corporate state.  Like Occupy Wall Street.</p>
<p>Turns out I could, and did, comment on Hedges’ lawsuit and his article.  Here’s what I wrote to Dan:</p>

<blockquote>Wow.  There’s so much to say about this—the statute, why it became law, this particular lawsuit, and Hedges’ comments in the article—that I almost don’t know where to begin.  But here goes: First of all, the part of the statute that all allows U.S. citizens to be arrested and detained (imprisoned) indefinitely at the behest of the president, including arrest here in this county or while in a foreign country on a short visit, is not only clearly unconstitutional but is unconstitutional in a manner that both Antonin Scalia and Anthony Kennedy made clear, in a “war on terror” case several years ago, that they believe is unconstitutional.  Eventually the Supreme Court will decide the constitutionality of this statute, and will hold the statute unconstitutional.  The question is whether this will be the case in which it does.</p>
<p>There is a “procedural” reason why the lower-level federal courts—the district court (the trial-level court) court in which the lawsuit was filed, and then the circuit court (the several-state regional appellate court)—may dismiss the lawsuit, claiming that in this particular case, the courts have no jurisdiction (legal authority) to consider the consider the constitutionality issue.  I place the word “procedural” in quotation marks because in this instance, the jurisdictional question, while clearly a threshold procedural question, actually is also a constitutional question: whether or not Hedges has legal “standing” to ask the courts to decide the issue—that is, whether he is claiming a “particularized” injury from the statute sufficiently concrete to meet the Constitution’s requirement that there be a “case or controversy” at issue before a court has “jurisdiction” (legal authority) to consider the issue on its merits—here, the constitutionality of the statute.   The case-or-controversy requirement comes from Art. III, which is the Article that creates the judicial branch and specifies its authority.  The case-or-controversy part says:  <br />
<blockquote>The judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in Law and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the Laws of the United States, and Treaties made, or which shall be made, under their Authority;&#8211;to all Cases affecting Ambassadors, other public ministers and Consuls;&#8211;to all Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction;&#8211;to Controversies to which the United States shall be a Party;&#8211;to Controversies between two or more States;&#8211;between a State and Citizens of another State;&#8211;between Citizens of different States;&#8211;between Citizens of the same State claiming Lands under Grants of different States, and between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or Subjects.</p></blockquote>
<p>Normally, a party has to already suffered injury before he/she/it can sue, so if you’re challenging the constitutionality of a law, you usually have to, say, already have been arrested for violating that law/required to pay the tax required by the statute/prohibited from doing something that you otherwise would do for violating that law.  (This is an issue in the “Obamacare” litigation challenging the constitutionality of the “individual mandate” provision; that part of the ACA hasn’t kicked in yet, and no one has been forced to pay the penalty for failing to buy medical insurance.)  But there are exceptions, mainly in First Amendment cases—free speech, free assembly, free exercise of religion—and in certain other types of cases in which you’d be risking serious criminal penalty by violating the statute (challenges to a particular section of the Selective Service Act, for example).</p>
<p>So for Hedges, the question of whether or not he has standing to challenge the constitutionality of the statute depends on whether he wants to do something particular that would place him in danger of being detained under the statute.  I haven’t read the complaint he filed in court, so I don’t know whether he’s claiming that he does, or not.  As for the article itself, it’s spot-on in its assessment that the time is past for any strategic-defense arguments in support of draconian laws of this sort.  Vigilance continues to be (in my opinion) in order, lest there be a successful attack of some sort.  But this statute has nothing to do with vigilance.  As Hedges points out, the FBI, the CIA, the director of national intelligence, the Pentagon and the attorney general didn’t support it.<br />“FBI Director Robert Mueller said he feared the bill would actually impede the bureau’s ability to investigate terrorism because it would be harder to win cooperation from suspects held by the military.”  This statute is nutty.</p>
<p>And, as the old saw goes, it’s also too cute by half.  And then some.  Which brings me to Hedges’ speculation that the real reason Congress enacted it, and the reason Obama signed it, is to thwart internal domestic movements that threaten the corporate state.  On these, Hedges misses the obvious point and, I think, runs off the rails.  A reason that the Republicans inserted that poison pill into the Defense Department spending bill is to thwart any threat to the corporate state, however slight.  But only indirectly.  They inserted it into the bill because they wanted to try to fabricate a Dems-are-soft-on-terrorism issue for the November elections.  And some Dems, their backs against what they thought erroneously was a wall, voted for it.  And Obama, ever unwilling to take a stand and actually go to the public with specifics to support it and to refute the Repubs, signed the legislation because it was, well, y’know, just too much trouble, or just too risky, or just too whatever, to point this out.</p>
<p>But here’s a point they missed: Republican pols think it’s still 2002.  Or at least 2004.  Or maybe even 1980.  Or 1968. And the Dems-are-soft-on-national-defense prescription for electoral success, and 21st century incarnation, Dems-are-soft-on-terrorism, are the gusher well they once were.  They don’t realize that that well’s finally run dry.  The public is paying no more attention to that then it is to the other now-decades-old Republican-playbook standards: culture-wars issues, welfare queens, tax “relief” for the wealthy; environmental deregulation, and—last but not least, liberal judicial activists (as any exist now).</p>
<p>Those wells have dried up, except in Tea Party circles.  Republican pols keep trying to dance with the one what brung ‘em.  The problem for them is that the dance is over. The problem for us is that, thanks to the comically long lag time before pols, Repub and Dem alike, realize this, we get statutes like this one. </p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This post will not describe any actual non fictional events.  My aim is to understand whether there are gaps in the law which can make bankruptcy profitable.  I know virtually nothing about the law, so I am typing in almost complete ignorance.  I do this, because I know nothing about CDS either and my effort to exploit this blog to learn about them was well received.</p>
<p>* The title is not meant to insinuate anything about any existing firm.  This note explains why I did not go with my original running title &#8220;Bane Capital Loots Doomed Inc.&#8221;</p>
<p>Caveat Lector<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Doomed Incorporated is an insolvent corporation whose CEO and board of directors won&#8217;t face facts enter Chapter 11 and let a bankruptcy court liquidate the firm (or is that chapter 7 ?).  I will assume that the debt is in the form of bonds not bank loans. Coldheart, Crafty and Robber (hence CCR but not to be confused with any centers for constitutional rights) is a closely held private equity partnership dedicated to finding the outer limits of the law.  Doomed is a profit opportunity, because its shares are very cheap.  So CCR can buy the firm without issuing new debt.</p>
<p>CCR also sets up a firm controlled by CCR called &#8220;The Sack&#8221; and sells the assets of Doomed to The Sack for below market prices.  Even at market prices, Doomed assets aren&#8217;t enough to pay interest and principle on its bonds, but even at these low prices, the proceeds of putting Doomed&#8217;s assets in The Sack are enough to pay coupons and pay off the face value of mature bonds for a while.   </p>
<p>At the end of this while, CCR declares The Sack bankrupt and bond holders get roughly zero cents on the dollar.  A huge amount of money has been made by taking money from bondholders by minimizing the recovery ratio (cents on the dollar).</p>
<p>Why is this illegal ?  Managers of publicly traded firms have a fiduciary duty to shareholders, but Doomed is now privately held.  Creditors can ask a bankruptcy court to protect them, but only once a firm is a dollar short or a day late (actually 60 days late I think, but I really know almost exactly nothing).  GAAP accounts can&#8217;t report non arms length transactions at other than fair market prices, but Doomed accounts are private as it is closely held so who cares.</p>
<p>In my ignorance, I think there is a wholly owned subsidiaries are really the same firm rule somewhere.  But CCR can also go to a pseudo partner The Beard Inc and give the pseudo partner 20% of the shares of the privately held Doomed 2 corporation.  Those shares are worthless, but CCR doesn&#8217;t have to make The Beard inc pay anything for them.  They don&#8217;t matter at all as the point is control of the firm not ownership of nonexistent equity.</p>
<p>I think this might be a real gap in corporate laws.  As far as I know (in my ignorance) corporate codes and SEC regulations contain detailed protections for shareholders, but it is assumed that partners can take care of themselves.  </p>
<p>Bond buying investors can use the data which is made public for shareholders (or really count on ratings agencies to use it).  They are senior to shareholders, so if shareholders are protected, they are too.  The shareholders are not organized enough to loot &#8212; a shareholders resolution which says &#8220;Let&#8217;s pay ourselves a huge dividend, then declare bankruptcy&#8221; is to blatant.   But if a firm is taken private, the bondholders, who have been free riding on shareholder protections, can be almost legally robbed.</p>
<p>Publicly traded firms have been taken private only in the past 30 years.  Has the law been changed to block the looting scheme which I describe ?  Has the scheme been clearly banned for centuries ? </p>
<p>Note that the scheme works even if bondholders are fully rational.  Doomed might be doomed because of bad luck.  When the bonds were sold, the probability of bankruptcy might have been low.  The existence of CCR means that recovery ratios will be low, but that doesn&#8217;t mean corporate bonds are worthless, since receipts in case of bankruptcy are a small, almost negligible and often completely neglected component of returns on bonds.</p>
<p>Note that I assume it is unwise to buy bonds from a privately held firm.  I am so ignorant that I don&#8217;t know how many privately held firms issue bonds. Note that CCR will faithfully and creditably honor bonds which it issues.  </p>
<p>OK a bit of reality.  My story does not at all correspond to the case of Bain Capital and GS inc.  In that case, bonds were sold after the firm was taken private.  My view is that only a fool would buy such bonds.  The outcome tends to correspond to my view.  I do have a history question &#8212; how did the ratings agencies rate the bonds of a privately held firm ?  It seems to me that, by their standard rules based on balance sheets and profit and loss statements, they must rate bonds issued by privately owned firms as of unknown risk, that is B or so.  Were they a large part of the problem this time too.  </p>
<p>In any case, in this post I assumed that looters can&#8217;t issue bonds, because I am an economist and I reflexively assume that investors aren&#8217;t total idiots.</p>

<p>A Tale From Our Libertarian Present </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been getting a lot of calls on my cell phone from telemarketers lately.  So has my wife.  Our numbers on the do not call registry, but just to be safe, we registered them again.  I&#8217;ve had random conversations with people about this, and found that some people are having similar experiences &#8211; lots of calls from telemarketers &#8211; while others aren&#8217;t getting any at all.  Very odd, but it seems the do not call registry is becoming useless.  This morning I got one such call at 1:40 AM.  </p>
<p>To me, this gives us a clue as to what a libertarian society might look like. Because it doesn&#8217;t matter how many laws and rules and regulations a society has, if they aren&#8217;t enforced, they don&#8217;t matter.  And it seems that the do not call registry is, for practical purposes, no longer enforced.</p>
<p>So what does that mean?  Well, my cell phone number, like my home, and my internet access, is my property.  I pay for it.  I pay for that property because I want to be able to use it in certain ways.  I like to be able to pick up my cell phone and reach family, friends, and business associates.  I like to be able to be reached by family, friends, and business associates.  I do not pay for these services to get calls from telemarketers at 1:40 in the morning.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But there are others who want to use the property they pay for in ways that affect me. They want to have a dialing machine call me up at 1 in the morning, just on the one in a million chance that I might buy whatever they&#8217;re trying to peddle.  And why not?  The cost to them is infinitesimal.  Which means I not only have to pay a price for my property, but I also have to pay an additional price to keep other people from using my property. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s already true with e-mail.  We all have a spam folder.  But there&#8217;s a cost to that spam folder &#8211; false positives.  Every so often you find out that you didn&#8217;t get a message you needed to get.  I just discovered that I was supposed to confirm a speaking engagement for a conference&#8230;  and that notice ended up in my spam file somehow.  That provides no cost to people producing spam, but their use of my property, their placing things I do not want in my e-mail account, costs me money.</p>
<p>This issue of other people using one&#8217;s property rights has long existed with physical property.  If you&#8217;re neighbor doesn&#8217;t wish to keep the music or odor or pollution he produces on his property, which is usually the case, he exports onto other people&#8217;s property.    <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%20http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2012/01/09/a-seismic-shift.html%20">Causing an earthquake on someone else&#8217;s property</a> is not an issue of bargaining over conflicting property rights, its taking someone else&#8217;s property rights away.  Ditto placing toxic fumes on other people&#8217;s land. Because the party producing those fumes only has the right to place those fumes on its own property, not to someone else&#8217;s.  If the music one neighbor produces crosses the boundary onto property someone else is paying for, the producer of that music is trespassing.  </p>
<p>Sure, to some degree, everyone produces externalities, but the question is, how big can the externalities be before they must be regulated?  As laws cease to be enforced, the government&#8217;s footprint diminishes and we move closer and closer to a libertarian society.  And the sad truth is, what libertarians haven&#8217;t thought through and realized is that such a society is one where individuals have to spend a lot of resources keeping other people from taking their property.  And its a society where we are all poorer.  All of us, even the captains of industry.  How much work would Howard Roark do, how productive would Dagny Taggart be, how much use for life would John Galt himself have if their respective neighbors decided to build a nuclear reactor and dispense with any effort to contain the radiation from crossing property lines?</p>

<p>You got that? The whore who fronts for an industry owned by multinational megacorporations like NewsCorp, Sony, and Viacom is actually attacking BoingBoing.net owners Happy Mutants LLC for using the internet for some evil agenda to steal Chipmunk movies just because they went on a one-day strike.

<p>Romney Reveals His Tax Rate Is &#8216;Probably Closer to 15 Percent</p>
<p>Source for this article:  Emily Friedman, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/romney-reveals-his-tax-rate-is-probably-closer-to-15-percent/" target="_blank">Romney Reveals His Tax Rate Is &#8216;Probably Closer to 15 Percent'&#8221;</a>, ABC News, Jan. 17, 2012. 
<div>At a press conference following the GOP debate last night, GOP presumed favored candidate Mitt Romney acknowledged for the first time that his effective tax rate is around 15%.  That&#8217;s a lot lower rate than middle class taxpayers typically pay. </div>
<div>Romney isn&#8217;t releasing his full return&#8211;at least not yet.  He says maybe he&#8217;ll release just the 2011 return in April.  But not any back returns. (That&#8217;d tell us more about his gains at Bain Capital than he probably wants us to know.)</div>
<div>What are his sources of income?  Romney acknowledges that during the last 10 years, his income comes &#8220;overwhelmingly&#8221; from some investments made in the past.  Other sources include a &#8220;little bit&#8221; from his book and &#8220;not very much&#8221; from speaker fees.  (&#8220;Not very much&#8221; is obviously a relative term.  Romney&#8217;s financial disclosure report released in August indicated that he was paid more than $370,000 in speaker fees for that filing period.  That&#8217;s considerably more than any middle class taxpayer makes&#8212;but doesn&#8217;t amount to &#8220;very much&#8221; for Romney, who is worth somewhere around $250 million or so.)</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>So for 10 years, Romney admits, he hasn&#8217;t labored much, but has nonetheless made considerable investment income that gets preferentially taxed.  That of course is a core problem with the preferential rate for capital income&#8211;it merely makes the festering wound of hugely unequal distribution of income (and wealth) worse.  The preferential rate is, essentially, a tax policy favoring redistribution upwards.  The rich get to pay a lower tax rate on their income than their secretaries, and their income is especially protected by other policies as well (like the weakening of unions from Reagan on, privatization of public activities from Reagan on, lax enforcement of anti-trust rules, lax enforcement of banking regulations, etc.).</div>
<div>At least Romney recognizes that the rich don&#8217;t need (and the economy wouldn&#8217;t benefit from) even more favorable tax breaks for rich people&#8217;s favored kind of income.  He noted that &#8220;the speaker&#8217;s plan to eliminate the capital gains tax for high income individuals&#8211;capital gains, interest and dividdnds&#8211;would not only be a very expensive provision in terms of having to fill an even larger budget hold but that would provide for people of very high income a possibility of no tax at all. &#8230; I just don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the right course.&#8221;  (But he does want to lower corporate tax rates, which&#8211;under the theory that corporate taxes are borne by corporate owners&#8211;would be just another form of preferential taxation for rich people who own most of the corporate stock.)</div>
<div></div>

<p>Offshored Assets still in IRS cross-hairs but new disclosure program available</p>
<p>As most who follow the issues are aware, the IRS has been focusing for some time on the foreign bank accounts of US taxpayers.  The big break came when the IRS was able to get some data from UBS, including information about particular bankers and mechanisms that US taxpayers were using to sequester significant amounts abroad to avoid paying US taxes on the income.   This has allowed the IRS to pursue leads and draw connections from bankers to accounts to taxpayers, and to pursue criminal prosecutions for international tax evasion in some cases.</p>
<p>There have been two &#8220;voluntary programs&#8221; for declaring offshore accounts and avoiding potential criminal prosecution with the payment of a set penalty&#8211;the first in 2009 and the second in 2011.  The penalty in the second program was stiffer than the penalty in the first program, so that those who delayed had to pony up more to get clear.   The programs have been enormously successful, bringing in more than $4.4 billion dollars, according to an IRS release announcing a reopening of the offshore voluntary disclosure program.  See<a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=252162,00.html"> IR-2012-5</a>.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Under the new program, some taxpayers may be eligible for the 5 or 12.5% penalties but the stiffest penalty will be higher than under earlier versions: 27.5% of the highest aggregate balance in foreign bank accounts during the 8 years prior to disclosure, up from 25% in  the 2011 program.  In addition, of course, participants have to file returns and pay back taxes and interest for the preceding 8 years, and pay any accuracy-related penalties due.</p>

<p>SOCIAL SECURITY AND BRAIN DAMAGE</p>
<p>Liberals Destroy Social Security While Claiming Victory</p>
<p>Republicans Cry “Please Not the Briar Patch, Br’er ‘Bama, please, please!”</p>
<p>Robert Kuttner, http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-kuttner/obama-social-security_b_1178904.html  tells us that Obama has won a great victory by getting the Republicans to extend the payroll tax cut; SS “will be made whole from transfers from general government revenues.  So far, so good.”</p>
<p>So far so bad.  The great glory of Social Security has been that it does not depend on “general government revenues.”  It is not a welfare program.  The workers pay for it themselves.  Therefore it contributes absolutely nothing to “The Deficit.”</p>
<p>Since  “liberals” frequently defend Social Security by pointing this out, you’d think that they could remember it long enough to avoid destroying the very foundation of Social Security.</p>
<p>But Kuttner tells us “there is no good reason why Social Security has to be funded entirely by payroll taxes.”</p>
<p>No reason, indeed, except that that is what Social Security IS.  Fund it from the general fund and it stops being Social Security.  It becomes welfare as we knew it. You can keep calling it Social Security but you will be fooling yourself.</p>
<p>Then Kuttner tells us, “the payroll tax&#8230;is one of our most regressive taxes&#8230;”</p>
<p>Except that it’s not a tax, and it’s not regressive.  </p>
<p>A tax is a “required payment FOR THE SUPPORT OF A GOVERNMENT.”</p>
<p>The payroll “tax” does not support any government; it is used to support the person who pays the tax.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>You can find reasons for calling the payroll tax a tax [it is a mandatory payment TO the government], but please contemplate this one fact:  SS does not support the government.  It supports the worker when he can no longer work.   I am sorry if the use of the word “tax” confuses you, especially when i deliberately say “the payroll tax is not a tax.” The point here is to get you to think.  Think about what Social Security IS, whatever words you want to use to refer to it.</p>
<p>As to being “regressive,”  a low income worker can expect to get an effective “real rate of return” on his Social Security investment of 10% or so;  a high income worker would expect about a 2% rate of return.  How “regressive” is that?</p>
<p>Again, if you have been taught to say, “regressive tax, regressive tax, awk, regressive tax” whenever you hear Social Security,  I can’t stop you.  I can only ask you to think about the harm you are doing.</p>
<p>You don’t call SS a “regressive tax” unless you are advocating changing it to a “progressive” tax by turning it into welfare paid for by “the rich.”</p>
<p>FDR, in spite of what Kuttner says, was smarter than that.  He knew what becomes of welfare programs, so he insisted SS be paid for by the workers themselves “so no damn politician can take it away from them.”</p>
<p>But Kuttner thinks that “making up the Social Security gap with a tax on millionaires is good policy. As long as the system is substantially financed by payroll taxes, the benefit still feels earned.”</p>
<p>How nice.  The poor can feel they earned their benefit, while the millionaires who are not getting the benefit will feel so good about paying for it that they won’t bother to try to cut the benefits, or means test them, or raise the retirement age&#8230;  because, you know, the rich are like that.  Kind and generous about paying taxes, as long as the poor “feel like” they are paying for it.</p>
<p>I could let Kuttner and other pppprogressives call SS whatever they want in the privacy of their own faculty clubs, but when SS is under attack for its life, it is reckless irresponsibility to call it “a regressive tax” and to entertain sucker dreams about getting “millionaires” to pay for it.</p>
<p>The Social Security “gap,” before Obama started playing with it, was forty cents per week.  Now that Obama has won his great victory over the Republicans the gap is sixteen dollars per week.</p>
<p>Since Obama has told the world that the Republicans won’t dare “impose such a huge tax raise on the middle class” we can be reasonably sure the Democrats won’t either.</p>
<p>So Social Security is now a welfare plan paid for by government deficits&#8230; just like Peterson always said&#8230; except it wasn’t true when Peterson said it.  Now, thanks to Obama and the Democrats and &#8220;progressives” like Kuttner, it is.</p>
<p>SS could still be resurrected, but that would take some skill and leadership&#8230; probably something like a “making work pay” tax cut to replace the “payroll tax holiday,” so that when the tax cut has to end, the &#8220;tax increase&#8221; won’t get blamed on Social Security.</p>
<p>But skill and leadership we do not have.</p>
<p>Write this down, so when your children are forced to live in the poor house in their old age, someone may read it and remember that once upon a time there was a way for workers to save their own money so they could retire at a reasonable age&#8230; with their money protected from inflation and market losses, and government deficits&#8230; by the ingenious idea of pay as you go financing.  This was called Social Security.  But it was destroyed by &#8220;the friends of the poor,&#8221; who thought they could force the rich to pay for it.</p>
