<p>Holman Jenkins&#8217; Support for Job Destruction at Bain Capital Doesn&#8217;t Hold Up<br />    
<div>Holman Jenkins Jr. writes an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal:  &#8220;The Truth about Bain and Jobs,&#8221; Jan. 14-15, 2012, Wall St. J. at A13.   His first paragraph makes his bias in favor of &#8220;private equity&#8221; clear.   He says any debate about private equity&#8217;s role in either job creation or  job destruction is &#8220;fruitless&#8221; because neither voters no politicians  believe that jobs should ever be destroyed.  (The implication&#8211;made  clear later on in the editorial&#8211;is that Jenkins thinks job destruction  is just fine and dandy in all cases.)</p>
<p>Note that one can be a progressive who believes that an important  purpose of government is to ensure that the economy perks along and  protects workers in the process of allowing innovation and  entrepreneurialship.  That doesn&#8217;t mean no jobs can be destroyed, but  that job destruction should occur when jobs become &#8220;obsolete&#8221; because of  innovation&#8211;not when good jobs are destroyed in this country so that  they can be handed to workers in other countries at much lower wages or  destroyed in this country as union jobs so that they can be handed to  nonunionized workers in this country at much lower wages.</p>
<p>The latter  kind of job-destroying, union-busting activity is frequently undertaken  by private equity funds&#8211;and that appears to be truly destructive of the  economy, since the gainers are the well-to-do investors in private  equity funds while the losers are ordinary working folks.  So when &#8220;free  trade&#8221; and &#8220;free markets&#8221; are really stand-in phrases covering a  fundamental facilitation of the unfettered ability of high-net-worth  investors to cannibalize the livlihoods of ordinary Americans in order  to reap an even greater share of GDP (and keep all the gains to  themselves rather than sharing them with labor), that is a kind of  destruction of jobs that is destructive to the economy as a whole.<br />Jenkins goes on to try to deal with the kind of situation that is  frequent in private equity takeovers&#8211;they do not just takeover almost  defunct companies and then almost miraculously turn them around into  profit-making companies that can be sold for higher value, although  there are occasions when they do achieve that.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Quite frequently,  takeover targets are profitable, stable, operating companies that have  managed to build a decent amount of working capital.   When private  equity takes them over, they siphon off the cash and often add  additional short-term profits by firing workers.  This can put the  company into a downward spiral that it never would have suffered without  the attention of the private equity vultures who have learned that they  can decimate a company and sell the parts for more than the whole was  worth.  That is a kind of destruction of jobs that is destructive to the  economy as a whole.</p>
<p>In the case of Bain Capital, a company like that was Safeway&#8211;a  profitable chain that was undone by the private equity markets.  Jenkins  blames that on the idea that &#8220;the fat in the supermarket industry would  soon be the target of WalMart Costco and other revolutionary  discounters, so competitive change was coming in any case.&#8221;</p>
<p>What that excuse for the vulture behavior of private equity overlooks  is the fact that the same policies that made private equity&#8217;s harsh  treatment of jobholders possible also made possible the WalMart  &#8220;revolution&#8221;.  That is, reaganomics adopted a pro-Business viewpoint,  based on a distorted notion of what markets are and what &#8216;free markets&#8217;  means.  That viewpoint led to a downplaying of anti-trust law, a  relaxation of labor laws and a general deregulatory approach to business  .  The result was companies like Walmart that combined haphazard  environmental compliance with fierce anti-union behavior that trampled  on workers&#8217; rights and an intentional pushing of what typically are  employer responsibilities off onto the public safety net.</p>
<p>Low wages,  lack of job security, inability to form a union (or even successfully  communicate among workers about one) placed workers in a situation where  they were barely making do on less, in real dollars, than workers made  decades before.  That is, the &#8220;competitive change&#8221; was a kind of vulture  economics in itself that was fostered by deregulatory and anti-union  policies lobbied for by the wealthy investors in the first place.</p>
<p>Jenkins further argues that the &#8220;fundamental problem&#8221; with many  companies today is that they have &#8220;a unionized workforce in an industry  where competitors aren&#8217;t unionized.&#8221;  This reflects the right-wing bias  of the Wall St. Journal against unions, seen as the enemy of Big  Business.  But it glosses over two key concepts:  (1) the fact that  competitors are not unionized is a direct result of the restrictive  anti-union laws and the jaundiced attitude towards unions in Big  Business today, that makes it as hard as possible to unionize and thus  builds up pressure on the few companies that remain unionized to race to  the deunionized bottom so that managers and owners can steal the  productivity gains for themselves, showing bigger &#8220;returns&#8221;; and (2) the  enormous benefit of unionization in ensuring that growth is broad-based  and opportunity-creating for the vast majority of Americans and that  unionization gives workers the ability to join together to have some  clout in negotiations with otherwise all powerful employers who will, if  there is no counterpressure, retain all productivity gains for  themselves (for the elite managerial class and the owners).</p>
<p>Jenkins asks readers to consider whether they&#8217;d be willing to pay  extra so that local manufacturers could &#8220;pay workers comp costs way out  of line [with] the industry&#8217;s?&#8221;  Again, the reason that one company&#8217;s  costs may be &#8220;out of line&#8221; may well be that it pays its workers a decent  living wage.  If the rest are taking advantage of workers by paying  less than that (probably because those workers haven&#8217;t been able to  benefit from unionization) the answer is to facilitate unions, not to  facilitate the continual downgrading of American jobs to poverty level  wages.  The neat &#8220;trick&#8221; of that is that higher wages across the board  makes it possible for workers to buy more of the products being offered,  thus making that slightly higher price that supports those industry  wide higher wages well worth it.  That was the kind of wisdom that Henry  Ford saw, when he paid his workers decent wages so that they could all  afford a Ford.</p>
<p>Jenkins thus thinks that the job destruction that goes on in today&#8217;s  vulture capital world is perfectly okay.  But he still doesn&#8217;t think  Romney ought to bring attention to it in the campaign.  He thinks there  is a &#8220;perfectly defensible story to tell&#8221; however, based on money and  work.
<ul>
<li>Money is not a problem, according to Jenkins.  Romney expected to be  paid well but got much much more than expected because of serendipitous  timing.  </li>
</ul>
<div>Now, it is likely obvious even to someone  like Jenkins that the kind of rapacious profits that private equity  fund managers make look, well, rapacious.  If you fire 10,000 people,  run a company into bankruptcy, and yet make off with millions yourself  from the experience, you may not only look like someone with no heart  but actually be a pretty good model of a greedy Gordon Gecko.  Jenkins  thinks Americans are ready to recognize that this is just a  serendipitous result for Romney&#8211;he was just lucky to to finish his  education right when a &#8220;great economic liftoff&#8221; was taking place.  A  less sanguine view would say that he had the wealth-seeking ambition to  capitalize on an elite education (provided by an elite family) and  family connections to industry just at the time when the great ripoff  was underway&#8211;the Reagan revolution that was starting to move assets out  of the middle class and into the hands of the superrich.</div>
<ul>
<li>Work is the other half of the &#8220;defensible story&#8221; according to  Jenkins.  Romney need not shy away from the fact that he earned great  wealth at Bain Capital, Jenkins is saying, because he really EARNED it.   &#8220;He put his talent for calm, careful analysis to work helping American  businesses adapt to the onrushing challenges of globalization and  technological change.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<div>This is the line that the rich merit  their wealth because they&#8217;ve worked hard to get it.  Makes you wonder,  of course, how they think the poor merit their poverty, since they work  hard (much harder in fact, and often at grueling physical labor) and  still end up there anyway. </div>
<div>What the &#8220;work/merit&#8221; story shows it  that wealth as a merited reward for hard work has very little to do with  it.  CEOs don&#8217;t add value to their corporations equal to 400-500 times  what their average workers do, but they are paid as though they did.   The reason isn&#8217;t because of hard work and merit, even for those CEOs  that do work hard and merit decent compensation for what they do.  The  reason they get paid outsized pay packages is because they are mostly in  control of their own pay and the pay of their ordinary workers.  They  take from the one and give to themselves, with the rubber stamp of a  board made up of compatriots who are doing the same at their own  companies.  They use the &#8220;benchmark&#8221; process (our goal is to be in the  top third on the pay scale) and the &#8220;competition&#8221; justification (if we  don&#8217;t pay X this much, he&#8217;ll leave and get a job at Y where they will,  and how will we replace him), even though these benchmark and  competititon justifications are self-serving and unreasonable on their  face. </div>
<p>Jenkins concludes with the statement that &#8220;it may even be true that  [Romney&#8217;s] ratio of jobs created to jobs destroyed was better than the  economy&#8217;s as a whole.&#8221;  Even if this were true (which I found doubtful  but cannot substantiate for Bain Capital in particular), the question is  whether it would justify the practices of private equity in taking over  stable, profit-making businesses and using globalization as a way to  shovel workers out the door and more profits into the hands of managers,  owners and private equity &#8216;venturers&#8217;.   Jenkins is essentially giving  private equity a bye&#8211;whether or not it is good for ordinary workers,  Jenkins thinks it is a per se good if it assists in the globalization  process.</p>
<p>This is where the debate needs to center in the campaign.  Just what  is the good and the bad about globalization?  There is a good deal of  bad, and it suggests that we should temper the way globalization works  rather than continuing to mouth the right&#8217;s slogans about competition,  globalization and free trade as an unmixed blessing.  How do  our  domestic policies  grease the wheels for corporations to benefit from  globalization at the expense of the vast majority of American workers?<br />To the extent that our policies are providing a path through which  corporations can socialize losses (firing workers who end up on  unemployment compensation and without health care or unable to afford  college, etc.) while privatizing gains (income saved from foregoing  promised payments to pension plans that are then disavowed as workers  are fired and unions broken), we need to change the policies.  Companies  should be forced to make full payments to benefit plans as  promised. The many corporate and individual tax loopholes favoring  highly compensated managers should be eliminated.  How about no  deduction for any pay that is more than some reasonable ratio times the  average non-executive worker salary, no matter whether it fits the  contrived definition of &#8220;performance-related pay&#8221; or not, for example.</p>

                                <p><u>INTRODUCTION</u></p>
<p>1) Rethug Speaker of the House John Boehner says that as a nation, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-creamer/no-mr-boehner-america-is_b_823304.html">&#8220;we&#8217;re broke</a>&#8220;; Rethug presidential candidate Ron Paul claims America &#8220;<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/rep-ron-paul-america-should-declare-bankruptcy/">should declare bankruptcy</a>.&#8221;  I say these two are liars, and at least one of them is crazy.</p>
<p>2) Tyler Cowan says &#8220;<a href="http://conhomeusa.typepad.com/bigideas/2011/02/tyler-cowen-.html">we are poorer than we think we are</a>,&#8221; due to mis-measurement of value, which might be true.  I believe his prescription for recovery is generally very bad, though.</p>
<p>3) In comments to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/matt-stoller-former-senior-policy.html">my previous Angry Bear post</a>, Bob McManus directed us to the writings of Michael Hudson, where we find his post <a href="http://michael-hudson.com/2011/12/democracy-and-debt/">Democracy and Debt</a>.   This is must reading.  The relevant point here is that the increasing  capture of wealth, as rents, by a creditor class impoverishes society in  general, and this eventually leads to severe repression, major social  upheaval, or both.  <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2011/04/brute-economics-of-slavery.html">I whole-heartedly agree</a>.</p>
<p>4) Jon Hammond&#8217;s <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/guest-post-does-lower-corporate-tax.html">guest post at Angry Bear </a>shows that a more-or-less continuous decrease in real investment has occurred during the post WW II era.</p>
<p>In  this series of posts, I intend to show that we are a wealthy nation,  but that our wealth  has been increasingly captured by elite creditors,  who, in my opinion, are strangling the economy by 1) extracting  excessive rents and 2) diverting this wealth to financial tail chasing,  rather than real investment.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><u>WHERE THE MONEY HASN&#8217;T GONE </u></p>
<p>Here is a look at average hourly earnings, the typical income of a working stiff, presented on a log scale.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=4ks"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=4ks" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Like almost every time series you can imagine, <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=4kt">including GDP</a>,  it exhibits a break near 1980.   The break is always to lower growth.   But, compared to most other data series, this break is especially sharp.</p>
<p>Hear  is the same series compared to GDP, an approximate measure of the  income of the nation, on a linear scale.  For this graph, each is  normalized to a value of 100 in Q1, 1965.</p>
<p>

<p>While earnings have grown less than 8 times in 47 years, GDP has grown more than 20 times.</p>
<p>Clearly,  the money has not gone to compensation of the workers whose labor  actually creates the wealth of the nation.  That might explain some of <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/12/be-vewy-vewy-quiet/">the alleged envy</a>.</p>
<p><u>CORPORATE PROFITS</u></p>
<p>As a first step in  finding where the money has gone, let&#8217;s consider the growth of corporate  after-tax profits since about 1950.  You can see it in <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=4j9">this FRED graph</a>.    It&#8217;s on a log scale, so constant growth would be a straight line.   There are lots of wiggles, but I see an increasing slope over time, and  it&#8217;s not an optical illusion.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0RbG_1gQUYM/Tw3ddKHUaoI/AAAAAAAABvQ/Q_Yy2WdP7TU/s1600/Corp+Profits+Jan+2012.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0RbG_1gQUYM/Tw3ddKHUaoI/AAAAAAAABvQ/Q_Yy2WdP7TU/s400/Corp+Profits+Jan+2012.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p>There  are a lot of ways to parse this.  One is to connect the dip bottoms  with straight lines.  I&#8217;ve done that with alternating red and blue to  show the slope increasing over time.  The problem is selecting which  bottoms to connect.  Some alternate choices are indicated in yellow.   The yellow lines define times of above normal profit growth: 1970 to  1980, 1986 to 1998, and 2001 through 2007.  Each of them leads to a  correction, indicated by a purple line across the top of the decline.</p>
<p>After  I did all that, it occurred to me to let Excel throw an exponential  best fit line on the data set, and you can see that as well.</p>
<p>I  see now that I could have included another yellow line from 1961 to  1967.  Notice that with each yellow line, the data set advances above  the exponential best fit line before a sideways correction takes it  below again.  After the correction is complete, profits increase again  until the best fit curve is breached.  Or, they did until now.</p>
<p>Remember  that on a log scale constant growth rate is represented by a straight  line, and that the growth compounds, so that the underlying increase is  exponential.  Sooner or later, that has to end.  Nothing in the real  word can go to infinity.  Here we see an exponential curve on a log  scale.  This demonstrates an increasing growth rate.  Therefore, the  underlying increase is greater than exponential.  If exponential growth  is unsustainable, what would you say about greater than exponential  growth?</p>
<p>In fact, the whole trend might now be falling  apart, as the last blue line has a much lower slope.  Also, for the  first time following a correction, profits have stayed below the trend  line, and the gap is increasing.</p>
<p>To show the extent of  national income capture by corporations, here is a graph of corporate  profits as a percentage of GDP.   I&#8217;ve divided the set into two  segments: 1951 to 1979, and 1980 on, and had Excel place a linear trend  line on each.  This division is somewhat arbitrary, but almost every  economic time series you can find has a break point within a few years  of 1980.  Division between &#8217;79 and &#8217;80 is the least favorable to my  point that Profits/GDP had no trend in the post WW II Golden Age, but  have trended sharply upward during the Great Stagnation period.</p>
<p>

<p>Profit/GDP  growth was unusually poor from 1980 through 1986.  Then from late 2001  through early 2006 it exhibited the greatest growth ever.  But remember  the denominator effect.  <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=4jc">Nominal GDP growth</a> increased rapidly following the &#8217;80-&#8217;82 double recession; while GDP  growth in this century has been generally slow.  The financial melt-down  of 2008 caused a dip that was sharp and brief, but the rebound has not  gone to a new high.  But even now, in the midst of anemic recovery,  profit/GDP is hovering in the 9 to 10% range, far above historical  norms. </p>
<p><u>CONCLUSION</u></p>
<p>The  corporate profit growth picture looks unsustainable, and that is  troubling.  What it means for the future is anybody&#8217;s guess.  But, what  we get from it is the first partial answer to the question, &#8220;Where has  all the money gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gone to profits, everyone.</p>

                                <p>I’ve noticed that many others, like me, are puzzled by the <em>mechanics</em> of the Saving=Investment accounting identity. How do household savings get <em>instantly and perfectly intermediated</em>, in a period, into investment spending — the purchase/creation of long-term productive fixed assets?
<p>An Aha! for me: According to Krugman’s textbook, they don’t.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-17-at-7.34.19-AM.png"><img title="Screen shot 2012-01-17 at 7.34.19 AM" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-17-at-7.34.19-AM.png" alt="" width="570"></a></p>
<p>First a correction: “The saving<s>s</s>[sic]-investment identity is a fact of [the] accounting [methods developed in the 30s by Kuznets and company to model production of goods and services the national economy].”</p>
<p>But that aside.</p>
<p>If people spend less than producers expect in a given year, the producers create too much product, and it builds up their inventories. That’s easy to understand. (It’s easier if you think about the producers instead of the car-dealer intermediaries that Krugman talks about.)</p>
<p>In the NIPA model, that inventory is counted as “investment.” This makes sense as far as it goes — that inventory is stored real value, stuff that can be consumed/sold for consumption in future periods. As Mankiw explains it in his textbook:</p>
<p><img title="Screen shot 2012-01-17 at 8.01.45 AM" src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Screen-shot-2012-01-17-at-8.01.45-AM.png" alt="" width="552" height="159"></p>
<p>But this explanation also pretty much obliterates the widespread and sloppy notion that increased saving (“<em>not</em> spending”) results in — causes — more productive “fixed investment.” The increased “investment” resulting from increased personal savings is used to expand <em>inventory. </em>The causations/incentives driving fixed investment are utterly other.</p>
<p>This also makes sense: when people are spending <em>less</em> (are “saving” more), does that spur producers to invest <em>more</em> in their businesses — buy/create more fixed assets?</p>
<p>Both recent and immemorial history suggest quite the opposite.</p>

<blockquote>Towards a 21-hour working week?</p>
<p>by Chris Bertram </p>
<p>Last Wednesday I attended an event at <a href="http://www.neweconomics.org/events/2011/11/22/about-time-examining-the-case-for-a-shorter-working-week" target="_blank">LSE (under the auspices of the New Economics Foundation)</a> exploring the idea of working-time reduction with an eventual goal of moving to a normal working week of 21 hours. Various people asked me to write up the event, so that’s what I’m doing, though I claim no special expertise in the surrounding economics and social science. The lectures were filmed, so I expect that they’ll be up somewhere to watch soon, which will make my comments superfluous. Tom Walker of <a href="http://ecologicalheadstand.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Ecological Headstand</a> was also present, so I wouldn’t be surprised to see some remarks from him there soon.</p>
<p>The three speakers were <a href="http://www.julietschor.org/the-book/" target="_blank">Juliet Schor</a> (author of Plenitude: The New Economics of True Wealth), Robert Skidelsky (former Tory spokesman in the Lords, but goodness knows what his party affiliation is today) and <a href="http://www.earthscan.co.uk/tabid/92763/Default.aspx" target="_blank">Tim Jackson</a> (author of Prosperity Without Growth).</p></blockquote>

<p>Romney&#8217;s Tax Plan Helps the 1%, Hurts the Bottom 40%</p>
<p>In spite of having to suffer some closer view of his Bain Capital time&#8211;during which the self-proclaimed &#8220;job creator&#8221; businessman did a lot of job cutting and destruction of going concerns so that his investors could make more money, Romney continues on his well-financed cruise to the GOP nomination.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s perhaps an appropriate time to bring out the Urban Institute/Tax Policy Center&#8217;s analysis of the Romney 59-point tax plan.  They have produced a <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3257" target="_blank">table</a> (T12-0004) showing &#8220;Mitt Romney&#8217;s Tax Plan Baseline: Current Policy Distribution of Federal Tax Change by Cash Income Percentile, 2015.&#8221;  The table looks at individual and corporate income, payroll (Medicare and Social Security) and estate taxes to determine the change in the total federal taxes for the various quintiles under Romney.</p>
<p>Who would have federal tax increases under Romney? Not the rich who have captured more and more of the income over the last decades.  Treating corporate shareholders as the payers of the corporate income tax, the table shows that the top one percent would get an average federal tax cut of $86,535 under Romney&#8217;s plan, while the top one-tenth of one percent would get an average tax cut of $432,940.   </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But guess what, the bottom two quintiles&#8211;made up of the poorest Americans who are struggling to make ends meet and who can be pushed off kilter by a single illness or other unexpected expenditure&#8211;will be the ONLY ones in the distribution who will pay more federal taxes under Romney&#8217;s plan than under the current policy baseline.  About 18% in that lowest quintile will pay almost a thousand more in taxes.  About 13% in the lowest quintile will pay about $125 less in taxes.  Similarly, in the second lowest quintile, about 18% will pay almost a thousand more; however, at least for this quintile about a third will pay almost $500 less, so that the overall increase averaged across these groups is less.</p>
<p>This is an unacceptable result.  The New York Times recently reported on various studies on inequality and a survey that shows that more and more people, across the spectrum of ideologies, ages, gender and other lines, now consider the conflict between rich and non-rich as important.  Survey Finds Rising Perception of Class Tension, New York Times, Jan. 11, 2012. </p>
<p>The demographics were surprising, experts said. While blacks were still more likely than whites to see serious conflicts between rich and poor, the share of whites who held that view increased by 22 percentage points, more than triple the increase among blacks. The share of blacks and Hispanics who held the view grew by single digits.</p>
<p>What is more, people at the upper middle of the income ladder were most likely to see conflict. Seventy-one percent of those who earned from $40,000 to $75,000 said there were strong conflicts between rich and poor, up from 47 percent in 2009. The lowest income bracket, less than $20,000, changed the least.</p>
<p>The reason the rich are getting richer is because the country has followed policies, essentially since Reagan, that favor the rich&#8211;from deregulation to relaxation of anti-trust to reduction in tax burdens to privatization to deunionization.  To add further rich-friendly policies to our tax code at this point should not be countenanced.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As you all have heard, Friday was (<a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&#038;blobcol=urldata&#038;blobtable=MungoBlobs&#038;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3DUS_Downgraded_AA%2B.pdf&#038;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&#038;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&#038;blobkey=id&#038;blobheadername1=content-type&#038;blobwhere=1243942957443&#038;blobheadervalue3=UTF-8">again</a>) S&#038;P&#8217;s day in the limelight. The rating agency <a href="http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?articleType=HTML&#038;assetID=1245327294763">downgraded over half of the 16 Euro area countries</a> put on credit watch negative in December 2011. A quick look at my feed shows several takes on S&#038;P&#8217;s action: the <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/01/euro-zone-crisis">Economist&#8217;s Free Exchange</a> comments on the now soft-core country, France; <a href="http://curiouscapitalist.blogs.time.com/2012/01/16/what-sps-downgrades-mean-for-the-euros-future/">Michael Schuman hammers</a> out the implications of the EA policy makers&#8217; &#8216;misguided&#8217; approach; <a href="http://globalspin.blogs.time.com/2012/01/13/as-france-gets-downgraded-sarkozys-re-election-chances-get-slimmer/">Bruce Crumley</a> (h/t Schuman) sees problems for Sarkozy; and as always, one of my favorite authors, <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/edwardhugh/2012/01/16/the-massendowngrade-effect/">Edward Hugh, </a>eloquently characterizes the downgrades in the context of the real economy.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s one curt take on the downgrade that I disagree with. <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/01/irrelevance-of-bond-ratings.html">Barkley Rosser</a> at EconoSpeak (h/t <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/irrelevance-of-bond-ratings.html">Angry Bear</a>) compares the downgrade of France and Austria from AAA to AA+ as the same as a downgrade to the US or Japan. Furthermore, his title implies that these downgrades are irrelevant. I wholly disagree. There is one simple reason for this: France and Austria are subject to high rollover risk, while the US and Japan are not. Why? Because France and Austria do not have monetary autonomy over the currency in which their debt is issued (euros, to which the ECB holds the right to supply), so all debt issued can be treated as foreign-currency debt. Debt issued by the US and Japan is primarily local-currency debt.</p>
<p>A bit of background on ratings. When S&#038;P, for example, changes its rating for a country, the rating that market participants (and the press) usually discuss is the foreign-currency rating. There&#8217;s another rating, the local-currency rating, that is used to quantify the risk associated with bonds denominated in the currency issued by the monetary authority. Now, for countries like the US and Japan, where the lion&#8217;s share of its debt issuance is denominated in its local currency, foreign-currency ratings are largely meaningless. The central banks in the US and Japan can always monetize debt issuance when needed. However, for any country in the Euro area (even Germany), debt is issued in a currency over which it has no effective control. Therefore, the foreign-currency rating is the one that matters.</p>
<p>For foreign-currency ratings, external indebtedness and leverage trajectories are key metrics. The next couple of quarters are likely to show either an improvement or deterioration in these metrics. If the real economy has not stabilized &#8211; <a href="http://www.ecb.int/press/pressconf/2012/html/is120112.en.html">the ECB desperately hopes</a> it has &#8211; and turns downward in coming months and quarters, creditors in euros will favor the markets with the higher credit metrics, Germany, Netherlands, and Finland relative to those with lower metrics, France and Austria. Better put: if the growth trajectory is worse than expected &#8211; <a href="http://www.ecb.int/stats/prices/indic/forecast/html/table_3_2011q4.en.html">the 63 respondents to the ECB&#8217;s Q4 Survey of  Professional Forecasters</a> expect +0.8% GDP growth in 2012 &#8211; spreads to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GDBR10:IND">German bunds</a> http://www.blogger.com/img/blank.gif(the only remaining AAA with a stable outlook, as rated by S&#038;P) will rise.</p>
<p>Ratings do matter for the EA countries. S&#038;P&#8217;s action is a harbinger of <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/987fd2fe-3ddc-11e1-91ba-00144feabdc0.html?ftcamp=rss#axzz1jdgb6if3">bad economic and political things to come</a>, not lower rates.</p>

                                <p>I don’t usually link to Paul Krugman because he everyone reads him anyway, right? He doesn’t need my google juice.
<p>But I have to make an exception <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/the-great-gatsby-curve/">here</a> because he adds to <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/trends-in-intergenerational-mobility-declining-opportunity-since-1980.html">my</a> <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/more-on-american-inequality-and-lack-of-opportunity.html">trove</a> <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/meritocratic-opportunity-on-the-decline.html">of</a> <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/pubs-and-economic-opportunity-not.html">graphs</a> demonstrating how America today — after thirty years of Reaganomics policies that were supposed to be all about freedom, liberty, and economic opportunity for all (yeah, and I have a bridge for sale), is at the bottom of the heap when it comes to economic opportunity.</p>
<p>The shining city on the hill keeps getting smaller and richer, and the slopes leading up to it steeper, rougher, and slicker.</p>
<p>That opportunity is best displayed through intergenerational mobility — what my friend Steve calls “convection.” What are the odds that a child will be in a different economic stratum from his parents? It’s a darned good measure of “meritocracy.”</p>
<p>Here’s the key graphic:</p>
<p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/the-great-gatsby-curve/"><img src="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/011512krugman1-blog480.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="344"></a></p>
<p> </p>
<blockquote><p>On the vertical axis is the intergenerational elasticity of income — how much a 1 percent rise in your father’s income affects your expected income; the higher this number, the lower is social mobility.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As you can see, it’s only getting worse. My explanation is <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/12/nine-reasons-that-progressive-policies.html">here</a>.</p>

                                <p>This is just a short post to illustrate the magnitude of GDP revisions.  I downloaded quarterly GDP data from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=5&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=1947&#038;LastYear=2011&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaBox=no#Mid">BEA</a> in June 2011.  I went back to BEA this morning to update the file. Forgetting about GDP revisions, I thought I&#8217;d be adding 2 or three more quarters of data, but discovered that all the numbers since Q2 2003 had been revised.  Prior values are unchanged.   Plotted below is the difference between the June, 2011 numbers and what I found this morning.</p>

<p>The depth of the trough in Q3 2009 was $194 Billion worse than we thought just a few months ago.  I was surprised to see the revisions go back a full 9 years.</p>
<p>Tyler Cowan got one thing right.  We are poorer than we think we are.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>…in Ayn Rand’s world, a man who self-righteously instigates the collapse of society, thereby inevitably killing millions if not billions of people, is portrayed as a messiah figure rather than as a genocidal prick, which is what he’d be anywhere else. <strong>Yes, he’s a genocidal prick with excellent engineering skills. Good for him. He’s still a genocidal prick.</strong></p>
