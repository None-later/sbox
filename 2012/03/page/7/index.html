<p>Euro Area GDP Report: Not Pretty</p>
<p>Today <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/2-06032012-AP/EN/2-06032012-AP-EN.PDF">Eurostat released </a>the second estimate of Q4 2011 Gross Domestic Product. Real Euro area (EA) GDP declined 0.3% over the quarter (-1.3% on an annualized basis). In this release Eurostat provides a breakdown across region, spending categories, and industry, and is much more detailed than the preliminary flash estimate. It’s not pretty.<br />The expenditure side was very weak. Household and government consumption declined 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, while gross capital formation tumbled 0.7%. Inventory depletion accounted for much of the reduction in investment and fixed investment deteriorated to a lesser degree. Exports fell 0.4%, while imports dropped a full 1.2%; therefore, net exports contributed +0.3% to overall GDP growth. The only positive contribution to GDP growth was imports – this type of technical growth is not sustainable.</p>
<p>As the chart below illustrates, exports has been a major driver of growth during this recovery. However, export demand is dropping off at the margin, and more weakness is expected. The level of new export orders (<a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/MarkitFiles/Pages/ViewPressRelease.aspx?ID=9206">a component of the Markit PMI</a>) fell for eight consecutive months through February.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/GDP_components3.jpg"><img alt="" height="426" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/GDP_components3.jpg" width="610"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />So it it’s up to domestic demand to spur further recovery. I also have my doubts there, given that fiscal austerity pushed the unemployment rate to a historical high of 10.7% in January (rather vertically, I might add).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/unemployment_chart1.jpg"><img alt="" height="425" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/unemployment_chart1.jpg" width="635"></a></p>
<p>A second part of the EA GDP report was the disturbing minority of countries that posted positive growth: just three out of thirteen. French growth clearly added balance to the average, given its large weight in the index. However, there are plenty of things that can go wrong there with higher energy costs, the rising <a href="http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/info-rapide.asp?id=14">unemployment rate</a>, and minimal <a href="http://www.insee.fr/en/themes/info-rapide.asp?id=105">business confidence</a>.</p>

<p>Going forward, it’s either up or down again for the EA. With the tight fiscal and now tightening monetary policy, the economy surely faces a lot of headwinds – down again would be my bet.</p>

<p>Greg Mankiw attempting to justify carried interest</p>
<p>  Greg Mankiw wrote an op-ed in the Sunday Times Money section: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/business/capital-gains-vs-ordinary-income-economic-view.html">Capital Gains, Ordinary Income and Shades of Gray</a>, New York Times (Mar. 4, 2012). </p>
<p>Mankiw notes the historical trend in the US to differentiate between capital gains and ordinary income regarding tax rates (though we have had notable experiements, both in the regular tax and in the AMT, to the contrary). He asserts that there are &#8220;good reasons&#8221; for the preference for capital gains income&#8211;offering only the standard idea of lack of indexation for inflation/deflation as an example.</p>
<p>The purpose of the piece is to justify the carried interest treatment of money managers&#8217; gains from dealing with other people&#8217;s money as equivalent to a carpenter who fixes up a dilapidated house and gets capital gains on the sale of the home, though the gains are really paying off the carpenter&#8217;s sweat equity. Since the carpenter gets capital gains under our system, he says, why shouldn&#8217;t the money manager who does an analogous activity (assuming&#8211;which may be a rather big jump&#8211; that hedge fund, private equity and other money managers are doing &#8220;sweat equity&#8221; that adds to the value of the assets under management, and should be viewed analogously to the carpenter).</p>
<p>The problem with making these analogies, especially in the area of capital gains, is that the idea of capital gains is problematic to start with. We&#8217;d be much better off with a code that made no such distinction, since there are certainly instances where the distinction is an arbitrary one. Since the line drawing isn&#8217;t easy (and it isn&#8217;t), then the distinction shouldn&#8217;t exist at all in the tax code. That would be the right solution overall.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the fact that a category is hard to apply generally doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t a right answer&#8211;or at least a better one&#8211; in particular circumstances. It is particularly inapt to compare money management with rehabilitation of dilapidated property. Rehabilitation of real property adds &#8220;real&#8221; value, in that the property is upgraded and will physically last longer than it would have without rehabilitation. Money managers don&#8217;t necessarily add any value&#8211;they may make money for themselves and others, but there is no real productivity gain in the economy in many (if not most) instances and certainly in any case where the gain is primarily speculative (often the case with hedge funds) or destructive of domestic businesses (often the case with private equity funds). </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Private equity fund managers, you will recall, invented the leveraged buyout (or maybe it would be more accurate to say that the idea of the leveraged buyout led to private equity funds). The idea behind leveraged buyouts was to take a stable, money-making company that wasn&#8217;t heavily debt-ridden, load it up with debt to cover the acquisition cost of the company, and use the cash flows from the company to pay off the acquisition debt. Private equity funds like Bain Capital could then leverage a minimal investment of their own with the purchased company&#8217;s debt to get huge profits, once the debt was paid off with good cash flows (already existing out of the company, with nothing due to the &#8220;management&#8221; of the money manager). The better the company taken over was, the more its cash flow could be counted on to pay off the debt, the more leverage would be added, the quicker the debt was paid off, and the better the ultimate profit. Sometimes this takeover was relatively harmless for the &#8220;good&#8221; company, but many times it was harmful&#8211;the takeover changes and debt resulted in focus solely on profits and not on long-term investment, and the company&#8217;s long-term stability was destroyed. The process was seldom positively beneficial for the company over the long term or for its community (though it may have been for particular shareholders and the managers themselves). The point here, of course, is that the LBO was targeted to (already)&#8221;good&#8221; companies with low leverage and high cash flow that could easily borrow in the market to cover the cost of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Later, of course, as the age of financial speculation got fully underway, private equity firms started taking over companies that could never expect to pay back the additional debt the LBO loaded them with. The private equity firms made their money in these cases by driving them into bankruptcy and laying off or firing the workers. Equity firms still got their profits out of the deal by selling off the components. But the companies (and especially their workers) were done for&#8211;if the companies survived at all, they were just parts of some conglomerate with very different functions.<br />Making money from managing other people&#8217;s money, in other words, is not per se productive for the economy as a whole and is not something we should reward with low taxation that acts as an incentive to the activity. We should recognize the money manager&#8217;s take as what it is&#8211;compensation for work done&#8211;and tax accordingly.</p>
<p>As an aside, I&#8217;ll note that it wouldn&#8217;t be unreasonable to have a handyman take ordinary income on his share of the profit that serves as reasonable compensation for his labor, but in most cases that&#8217;s a difficult facts and circumstances issue for the Service to sort out after the fact. One reason carried interest is such an obvious place to repair the problematic categorization of labor income as preferential capital gains is that there will be a partnership and there will be records of &#8220;management fees&#8221; and &#8220;carried interest allocations&#8221;. Given our sophistication about partnership allocations, identifying and classifying the carry as ordinary income is a relatively simple endeavor.</p>

                                <p>My last <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/business-roundtable-proposes-obamacare.html">post</a> prompted me to revisit <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/why-we-have-such-a-wacko-health-insurance-system.html">one</a> from last May that I thought Bears might appreciate. For your delectation:</p>
<p>Conservatives love to point out that our employer-based health insurance system is a result of wage controls under FDR. Since employers weren’t able to attract workers with higher wages, they started offering benefits instead — notably health insurance.</p>
<p>I recently read Frank Freidel’s <a href="http://isbn.nu/9780316292610">biography</a> of FDR, and the whole story became clear.</p>
<div>The post-Pearl Harbor economic surge was causing rapid inflation.</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>By March, 1942, food cost almost 5 percent, and clothing 7.7 percent, more than on the day of Pearl Harbor; the cost of living had risen 15 percent since September 1939. [Leon] Henderson predicted prices might rise 23 percent more by the end of 1942. The nation, as Roosevelt well realized, was reaching  the critical point where, as a result of price increases, demands for wage increases could force spiraling inflation.</p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Roosevelt was desperate to prevent that eventuality.</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Heavier taxes to drain excess buying power were imperative. [This is not complicated; see Abba Lerner on &#8220;Functional Finance.&#8221;]</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Conservatives in Congress (then as now) were rabidly anti-tax — gotta protect the monied class — but despite their supposed free-market ideology, they <em>were </em>willing to impose wage controls. (Big surprise.) Roosevelt was able to get this second- or third-best solution through Congress.</div>
<p>So the wage controls that resulted in our ridiculous employer-based health-insurance system were a direct result of conservatives’ hypocrisy.</p>
<p>And now, notwithstanding Ryan’s obviously-never-gonna-happen voucher feint, conservatives have demonstrated themselves to be dead-set on maintaining the status quo of employer-based private health insurance (they had their &#8220;blank piece of paper&#8221; for six years of unfettered control, did nothing about it…) — the very “historical accident” that they so bemoan, and that they are responsible for inflicting on the nation.</p>

<p>Whodathunkit?</p>
<p>And what do they recommend?</p>
<blockquote><p>Creating greater consumer value in the health care marketplace by <strong>using health information technology and empowering consumers with more information about good quality health care</strong>.</p>
<p>Providing more affordable health insurance options for all Americans by <strong>creating an open, all-inclusive private market for health insurance</strong> and replacing today’s fragmented state-by-state market with multistate markets. To ensure that insurance plans are solvent and meet certain minimum requirements, the role of <strong>individual states as the primary regulator should continue</strong>. Broader, more competitive markets will create more choices for more health care consumers.</p>
<p>Engaging all Americans in taking an active role in their health care. First, this means <strong>placing an obligation on all Americans to obtain health insurance either through their employer or the private market</strong>. Second, we must encourage all Americans to participate in employer- or community-based prevention, wellness and chronic care programs.</p>
<p>Offering <strong>health coverage and assistance to low-income, uninsured Americans that create a stable and secure public safety net.</strong> This assistance would be financed from the cost savings and efficiencies generated by a more competitive and value-driven health care system.</p>

                                <p>Eminent New Keynesian Economist <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/f/pba274.html">Susanto Basu</a> commented on a post challenging people to come up with an empirically useful idea in macroeconomics not to be found in &#8220;The General Theory of Employment Interest and Money.&#8221;  Here I will just note again how incredibly polite New Keynesians tend to be. bold numbers added for future reference </p>
<blockquote><p>This is a great challenge. I am answering off the top of my head, and will probably think of things I want to add later. Empirical findings that seem hard to explain without forward-looking expectations: [1] Mankiw, Miron and Weil on interest rates and the founding of the Fed (AER, 198?), [2] Sargent on the quick remonetization of economies ending hyperinflation, and probably most importantly [3] the empirical work in Milton Friedman&#8217;s Theory of the Consumption Function. Apropos that last, since a lot of what you say is about consumption, the recent micro research on consumption is much more nuanced than your portrayal. One of the best recent papers is Hsieh (2003, AER), which shows that the PIH works very well for large, predictable income changes but *among the same people* quite badly for small and irregular changes. This finding points to the need for refinements of models based on forward-looking expectations (like costly information processing) rather than their wholesale removal. Cochrane (1989, AER) is insightful on this point. Apropos aggregate data and excess sensitivity, I would point to my paper with Miles Kimball (http://www.umich.edu/~mkimball/pdf/cee_oct02-3.pdf), which tries to challenge the interpretation of the famous Campbell-Mankiw papers. Shifting from data to models qua insightful stories, I think it&#8217;s pretty clear that Keynes makes sense only with substantial nominal rigidities. Now I stand foursquare for the importance of sluggish nominal wage and price adjustment in lots of circumstances and for long periods of time, but even I have a hard time saying that decade-long events like the Great Depression or Japan in the 1990s are due to price inflexibility over such long periods of time. (And yes, I know Tobin/DeLong-Summers on destabilizing price flexibility. But still.) For something on that scale, I find multiple-equilibrium models like Diamond (1982) or Benhabib-Farmer (1994) much more appealing intuitively. [4] But I don&#8217;t think one can tell those stories without rational expectations&#8211;at least not easily. Benhabib-Farmer show conditions under which the steady state becomes a sink rather than being saddlepoint-stable in the forward dynamics. But my guess is that if you put in backward-looking expectations, the sink would turn into a source, and the multiple equilibria would disappear. This is all about intuition and telling just-so stories with models rather than anything with clear empirical support, but I would say that&#8217;s also the appeal of Keynes. Thanks for making me come up with reasons why I think modern macro isn&#8217;t all a waste! I look forward to your thoughts. Susanto Basu</p></blockquote>
<p>I answer the answer to the challenge after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>[1] I haven&#8217;t read &#8220;Mankiw, Miron and Weil on interest rates and the founding of the Fed (AER, 198?)&#8221;.  I will just note that I aaked for a prediction and this paper was written after the founding of the Fed.  </p>
<p>[2]  &#8220;Sargent on the quick remonetization of economies ending hyperinflation.&#8221;  This time I won&#8217;t just note that it isn&#8217;t a prediction, because it is in &#8220;The General Theory &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>2) Sargent (relying on the hard boring archival research of economic historians) noted that at the end of four hyperinflations the Phillips curve was vertical.  Keynes relying on casual empiricism said the same thing (not similar the same).  The following passage is incomprehensible without context (and uncharacteristically turgid in context) but it is Sargent&#8217;s observation.  </p>
<p>The General Theory &#8230; chapter 21 section 6</p>
<p><i>&#8220;e without suffix ( = Mdp/pdM) stands for the apex of this pyramid and measures the response of money-prices to changes in the quantity of money.</p>
<p>[skip] </p>
<p>&#8220;But in general e is not unity; and it is, perhaps, safe to make the generalisation that on plausible assumptions relating to the real world, and excluding the case of a “flight from the currency” in which ed and ew become large, e is, as a rule, less than unity.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>In English, the claim is that in the case of hyperinflation &#8220;flight from the currency&#8221; an increase in the money  causes a proportional increase in the price level so no effect on output or employmen (OK it is possible that he thought e would be greater than 1 in case of hyperinflation so increased prices would cause reduced real balances as claimed (with data) by Cagan).  Having been alive in 1923 Keynes had noted that the end of the German hyperinflation was not accompanied by a sharp decline in employment.  I think Sargent set up and knocked down a straw man.  He certainly didn&#8217;t cite Keynes or any old Keynesian claiming that there was a sloping Phillips curve in e.g. Germany in the 20s.</p>
<p>[4] Not in order.  Benhabib and Farmer have interesting models.  In fact it is much much easier to get models in which sunspots matter if one doesn&#8217;t assume rational expectations.  The hard part in these models is to find a way that an asset price (or shadow price) can be different from the steady state (or balanced growth &#8212; that is steady state for the properly scaled variables) without exploding.  This is hard if an asset value equation is imposed &#8212; that is hard exactly if one assumes rational expectations.  If one allows irrational exuberance and/or panics everything is much too easy &#8212; trivally easy in fact. That&#8217;s why the papers always impose rationality.  I think that Benhabib and Farmer are on to something, but that is a hope not a confirmed prediction.</p>
<p>As an aside, I note that there is a quite different way to get stability and indeterminacy.  Different enough to be published anyway.  See</p>
<p>Alessandra Pelloni and Robert Waldmann (1998) &#8220;Stability Properties of a growth Model,&#8221; Economics Letters, vol. 61 pp 55-60.</p>
<p>I can promise you that this model has exactly zero influence on my thoughts about the economy.  Mathematically it works just as well as the Benhabib Farmber models, but I am absolutely sure that it has nothing to do with reality.  Speculation about any possible conflict between co-authors due to this freequently stated certainty would not be appreciated.</p>
<p>[3] &#8220;the empirical work in Milton Friedman&#8217;s Theory of the Consumption Function. Apropos that last, since a lot of what you say is about consumption, the recent micro research on consumption &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The PIH.  Look I wasn&#8217;t always like this.  I used to be only 90% alienated from the mainstream.  I have said (in lectures) that the PIH is partly true, explains facts which seemed mysterious and is not in &#8220;The General Theory &#8230;&#8221;.  In fact the challenge used to include &#8220;except for the PIH&#8221;.  But then I had an alarming thought (see below).</p>
<p>Keynes considered the effect of expected future income on current consumption.  Relying as always on casual empiricism (it is hard to run regressions with almost no data and no computer) he guessed that expected future income must be considered to explain individual consumption but also that it is not useful in explaining aggregate consumption.</p>
<p>&#8220;The General Theory &#8230;&#8221; Chapter 8 section 2 point 6</p>
<p><i>(6) Changes in expectations of the relation between the present and the future level of income. — We must catalogue this factor for the sake of formal completeness. But, whilst it may affect considerably a particular individual’s propensity to consume, it is likely to average out for the community as a whole. Moreover, it is a matter about which there is, as a rule, too much uncertainty for it to exert much influence.</i></p>
<p>Much evidence that there is something to the PIH (glass half full&#8211; there must be at least some liquidity constrained consumers to fit the facts) is based on micro data.  This tends to confirm Keynes&#8217;s guess as usual.  I note that his mention of &#8220;uncertainty&#8221; seems to appeal to his &#8220;Treatise on Probability&#8221; which I haven&#8217;t read.  He does not assume that agents have a subjective probability distribution and maximize expected utility.  He considers the possibility that, if something is highly uncertain, people will just put it out of their minds.  I think he is right.  This is much much further from contemporary practice than  just assuming that people don&#8217;t have rational expectations so their subjective probability distribution does not correspond to the objective probability distribution conditional on information available to them.  It is an explanation (using the word very loosely) of why people might act myopic regarding aggregates even if the data should give them some ability to forecast GDP and the price level.</p>
<p>OK what about reality ? Is there any evidence that forecasting future aggregate income is a useful step in forecasting or fitting aggregate consumption ? Hmmm well first, as predicted by the PIH for some stochastic processes of aggregate income, the coefficient of variation of consumption is lower than that of income.  For other stochastic processes, this is a problem for the PIH (excess smoothness).  Given the state of the debate (when last I checked long ago) this is about 0 evidence for or against the PIH.  There are other explanations.  One (very important to old Keynesian models and I admit based in large part on what Keynes wrote) is that consumption is a constant &#8220;autonomous consumption&#8221; plus a constant times disposable income.  This silly model incorrectly implies that the ratio of consumption to income should decline as per capita income increases.  Also poor people violate their lifetime budget constraint somehow.  </p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t think Keynes was that silly.  In particular he presented another explanation for the smoothness of consumption ( which implies an interpretation of &#8220;autonomous consumption not as an exogenous constant but as a predetermined endogenous state variable) <br />chapter 8 section 3 paragraph 3</p>
<p>&#8220;This is especially the case where we have short periods in view, as in the case of the so-called cyclical fluctuations of employment during which habits, as distinct from more permanent psychological propensities, are not given time enough to adapt themselves to changed objective circumstances. For a man’s habitual standard of life usually has the first claim on his income, and he is apt to save the difference which discovers itself between his actual income and the expense of his habitual standard; or, if he does adjust his expenditure to changes in his income, he will over short periods do so imperfectly. Thus a rising income will often be accompanied by increased saving, and a falling income by decreased saving, on a greater scale at first than subsequently.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah habit formation.  Is there really evidence which supports the PIH against the hypothesis of myopia combined with habit formation ?  The second is the Marglin model of consumption.  It is definitely anticipated by Keynes.  The alarming thought is that habit formation explains the cross sectional patterns which are also explained by the PIH (eg the fact that for the same current income African Americans have lower consumption than white Americans).  Consumption is not just a function of current income.  But does it work better to consider the discounted stream of future income or a geometric average of past income (as would be true in the model of myopia and habit formation).  Especially is there macro evidence which distinguishes the two ?</p>
<p>Well the PIH implies Ricardian equivalence and the myopic habit model doesn&#8217;t.  Uh the evidence is not kind to the PIH on this.  OK look across countries there are some countries with persistently rapid growth and others with slow growth.  Other things (especially r) equal, the PIH says rapid growth countries should have high C/Y.  The myopic habit models say they should have low C/Y.  They have low C/Y.  OK OK given the correlation of S and I, this could be just low C/Y causes high growth (it is two facts that the variance in savings rates is high compared to the variance of current account surpluses and that the correlation is not one).  But the evidence, such as it is, is again unkind to the PIH. </p>
<p>I&#8217;d say Keynes on consumption reads a whole lot like an informal summary of recent empirical research on consumption (note also the bit about precautionary savings which I haven&#8217;t mentioned yet). </p>
<p>Chapter 9 section 1 point 1</p>
<p><i>&#8220;There are, in general, eight main motives or objects of a subjective character which lead individuals to refrain from sepdning out of their incomes<br />(i) To build up a reserve against unforeseen contingencies&#8221;<br /></i></p>
<p>I note that Hsieh (2003 AER) tends to confirm Keynes&#8217; guess.</p>

                                <p><strong><em>Or:</em> Even a Stopped Clock is Right, Eventually</strong>
<p><strong></strong>For quite a while I’ve been explaining the rabid, frantic vehemence of tea partiers and Republicans in general with a single visualization:</p>
<p>They’ve got their backs against the seawall, and a massive, overwhelming demographic tidal wave is looming over them.</p>
<p>The terror that situation provokes among <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/tea-partiers-old-white-rich-educated-men.html">old, white, rich</a>, “<a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/republicans-more-education-less-reality.html">educated</a>” male types is enough to mobilize a hell of a lot of political activity and influence (especially when it’s coopted and channeled by tens of billions of dollars in corporate propaganda). This goes a long way toward explaining the backlash of the 2010 election.</p>
<p>But desperate maneuvering can’t <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cnut_the_Great">stop the tides</a>.</p>
<p>This demographic notion got its first major airing in Judis and Teixeira’s 2002 <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Emerging-Democratic-Majority-John-Judis/dp/0743254783/">The Emerging Democratic Majority</a>, </em>which seems to have been a little ahead of it’s time. But as Jonathan Chait suggests in ”<a href="http://nymag.com/print/?/news/features/gop-primary-chait-2012-3">2012 or Never</a>,” the demographic clock may finally be ticking up to high noon.</p>
<blockquote><p>The modern GOP—the party of Nixon, Reagan, and both Bushes—is staring down its own demographic extinction.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite assorted and sadly wishful pooh-poohing on the right (“the Republicans will just rebrand themselves”; “second-generation Latinos will be more conservative”), the demographic reality is displayed quite starkly in two graphs from a recent <a href="http://www.pewhispanic.org/files/2011/12/Deportations-and-Latinos.pdf">Pew report</a> (PDF; hat tip <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/03/04/is-the-republican-party-almost-over/can-obama-recapture-the-hispanic-vote">Ruy Teixeira</a>).</p>

<p>Say “buh bye.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as Robert Reich <a href="http://robertreich.org/post/18391045294">reminds</a> us: for the present, “the loony right” remains “a clear and present danger.”</p>

                                <p>Jon Hammond from <i>econographia</i> reseached the topic of contraceptive pills on the cost aspects involved with health insurance at my request.  Instead of losing real data in the comments sections on previous posts, I am posting his findings here:</p>
<p>  Here are some of the empirical findings dealing with the insurance costs and cost-savings of coverage for contraceptive services.     The direct costs of providing contraception as part of a health insurance plan are very low and do not add more than approximately 0.5% to the premium costs per adult enrollee (see Daroch, J. E.). In 1998, Buck Consultants estimated that the direct cost of providing contraceptive benefits averaged $21 per enrollee per year (see Daroch, J. E.). The most recent actuarial analysis, completed by the Actuarial Research Corporation in July 2011, using data from 2010, estimated a cost of about $26 per year per enrolled female (see Callahan, C.)</p>
<p>However, with respect to the effect on insurance premiums when medical costs associated with unintended pregnancies are taken into account … including costs of prenatal care, pregnancy complications, and deliveries … the net effect on premiums is close to zero (see Washington Business Group on Health, Sept 2000). And when time away from work and lost productivity are considered (<i>factors salient to employers</i>) . . the total costs to employers are reduced.</p>
<p>PriceWaterhouseCoopers issued a report in 2007 which found that providing contraceptive services yields a net cost-savings (see Campbell, K.P.).     </p>
<p>The cost-savings impact of contraceptive services has also been demonstrated via the Medicaid Section 1115 Family Planning Demonstrations conducted in six states in the 1990s.

                                <p>Simon Johnson at <i>Baseline Scenario </i> writes in <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/03/02/making-the-united-states-more-like-greece/">Making the United States More Like Greece</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the big problems in Greece over the past decade or so is that the government was not honest with its data. Various people assisted in the matter – including Goldman Sachs with respect to some debt issues – but ultimately this was a political decision at the highest level. The people running the country decided to conceal the true nature of their budget and their debt. This deception ended up costing the country dearly – completely undermining its credibility under pressure and making it much harder to turn the fiscal and economic situation around.<br />…<br />In the modern United States, cutting taxes leads to lower revenue and larger budget deficits. There are no two ways about this – as Ronald Reagan discovered in the early 1980s. (In our new book, <em><a href="http://whitehouseburning.com/">White House Burning</a></em>, we go through the evidence on this point in detail, including important work by Greg Mankiw, former top economic adviser to George W. Bush and now working with Mitt Romney, which confirms that cutting taxes in the U.S. will lower revenue.)<br />But many Republicans feel that this is not true – in my conversations with them, for example in congressional hearings over the past year, the conviction seems to be that the research on this topic is bad science, even when done by Republicans. But convincing the CBO to abandon its proven and sensible approach to budget scoring has been difficult.<br />&#8230;<br />The solution currently under consideration is simple in its elegance – and downright frightening in its implications.</p></blockquote>

<p>Today’s real retail sales gave the ECB and EU heads of state another reason to keep their fingers crossed for stability of the Euro area economy (<a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-05032012-AP/EN/4-05032012-AP-EN.PDF">.pdf of release</a>). In January, volume adjusted retail sales increased 0.3% in the Euro area (EA) and broke a 4-month trend downward. On a 3-month annualized basis, though, real retail sales are falling at a 2.2% pace. Therefore, on a trended basis the second derivative may be stabilizing but the first derivative remains conspicuously negative.</p>

<p><a name="more"></a><br />I suppose that the ECB and EU heads of state will take this month of reprieve to pat themselves on the back for policy well done. However, in looking at the cross section of the monthly gains, France was the primary driver of the regional improvement, +2.1% over the month. We’re not out of the woods yet.</p>

<p>Greece, Spain, and Italy haven’t reported for January, so we’ll have to wait on the over or under regarding revisions. I’ll take the under, however, given that Spanish and Italian service PMIs are in the low 40′s with the employment component a serious drag (<a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/MarkitFiles/Pages/ViewPressRelease.aspx?ID=9241">.pdf of the Markit release</a>).</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <div>Seriously.  In the rambling press release that he self-styled an apology to Georgetown U. law student Sandra Fluke for calling her a slut and a prostitute, Limbaugh groused:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Amazingly, when there is the slightest bit of opposition to this new welfare entitlement being created, then all of a sudden we hate women. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>He then explained his position thusly:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities.  What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So even as late as yesterday afternoon when he released the statement, he’s claiming that <i>taxpayers</i>would be paying the part of employee and student healthcare premiums that cover contraceptives.  And that taxpayers pay for running pants, shorts and tank tops for employees and students who jog, but don’t pay for the Nikes and Reeboks. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>He apparently doesn’t read Angry Bear (see “Will ‘We’ Really Be Paying Sandra Fluke’s Healthcare Insurance Premiums?”, below.)  He should, though.  Dana Loesch, though, clearly does.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>What? You’ve never heard of Dana Loesch?  Well, you’re in good company.  Mine.  I’d never heard of her until this morning, when I read<a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/03/rush-limbaugh-apologizes-for-verbal-attack/"> the New York Times article</a>about Limbaugh’s statements.  The article says:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>At least one conservative commentator, Dana Loesch, appeared to back Mr. Limbaugh’s original sentiments, writing on Twitter on Saturday, “If you expect me to pay higher insurance premiums to cover your ‘free’ birth control, I can call you whatever I want.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>So, whatever the merits of her claim to a right to libel anyone whose medical insurance coverage and use raises “her” insurance premiums, Loesch at least does recognize the difference between private insurance premiums and coverage and taxpayer-funded welfare entitlements.  Limbaugh does not.   
</p>
</div>
<p>
<div>Happily, a mainstream media pundit understands this non-trivial distinction, too, and mentions it.  In her New York Times column today, Maureen Dowd <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/opinion/sunday/dowd-have-you-no-shame-rush.html">writes</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>[Limbaugh] said insuring contraception would represent another “welfare entitlement,” which is wrong — tax dollars would not provide the benefit, employers and insurance companies would. And women would not be getting paid just “to have sex.” They’d be getting insurance coverage toward the roughly $1,000 annual expense of trying to avoid unwanted pregnancies and abortions, and to control other health conditions.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, AB readers, do you think Dowd reads AB?  Nah.  She probably figured it out all by herself. But Loesch probably reads AB.  Okay, or Forbes online. (<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/03/03/rush-limbaugh-sandra-fluke-and-why-is-contraception-part-of-health-insurance-anyway/">Thanks for linking to it, Tim Worstall!)</a> For better or worse.  I mean, I’d hate to be, say, (as Bruce Webb points out in a comment to my earlier post) a skier or mountain climber who works for the same employer that Loesch does, or at least has the same insurance carrier that she has.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Wouldn’t want Loesch to accuse them of having murdered their mother, or something.
