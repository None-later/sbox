<p>  On the 23rd the Obama administration will publish the administrative regulations for Medicaid expansion.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.medicaid.gov/Federal-Policy-Guidance/Downloads/REG-03-16-12.pdf">http://www.medicaid.gov/Federal-Policy-Guidance/Downloads/REG-03-16-12.pdf</a> </p>
<p>As reported by Modern Healthcare, eligibility will be simplified to an income test as a percentage of the federal poverty level. This may expand Medicaid by as many as 17 million recipients by 2016.  There are a number of administrative issues addressed, many focused on simplifying and streamlining processing.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Jonathan Haidt <a href="http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/20/how-to-get-the-rich-to-share-the-marbles/">reports</a> an interesting experimental result:</p>
<p>Two three-year-olds walk up to a marble-delivery machine that has two bins. Each stands in front of one bin. Three scenarios:</p>
<div>1. One bin has three marbles in it, the other has one: the winner is unlikely to share to equalize the takings.</p>
</div>
<div>2. There are two ropes to pull; one delivers one marble, the other three: the winner is unlikely to share to equalize the takings.</p>
</div>
<div>3. Two ropes, but both must be pulled <em>together</em> to deliver the one/three marbles: the winner is <em>likely</em> (75%!) to share to equalize the takings. (Either spontaneously, or on request from the loser.)</p>
</div>
<p>If people feel that they <em>must</em> work together to get the goods, they also feel that they should (or even <em>want to</em>) share the goods.</p>
<p>Haidt’s take (my emphasis):</p>
<blockquote><p>If there’s a <strong>problem with the ultra-rich,</strong> it’s not that they have too much wealth, it’s that <strong>they bought laws that made it easy for them to gain</strong> and keep so much more wealth in recent decades. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Sarah Palin gave a speech last September lambasting “crony capitalism,” which she defined as “the collusion of big government and big business and big finance to the detriment of all the rest – to the little guys.” I think that she was on to something and that she was right to include big government along with big business and big finance. The problem isn’t that some kids have many more marbles than others. <strong>The problem is that some kids are in cahoots with the experimenters. They get to rig the marble machine before the rest of us have a chance to play with it.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Now add this:</p>
<p>The losers <em>know</em> the game is rigged, so their innate intution tells them that the winners should share.</p>
<p>The winners refuse to know that the game is rigged — deny it vehemently — so they think the losers are unreasonable in their expectations of sharing.</p>
<p>Contributing: The American cult of individualism — the widespread belief among the successful that their success is a result of their efforts only, so they <em>deserve</em> their winnings — means that their natural human work-together-share-together instincts aren’t invoked. This even when they’re wrong about the relative contribution of their individual efforts.</p>
<p>So the winners are deluded about two things: 1. the relative contribution of their individual efforts (compared to A. luck and B. the rules/playing field), and 2. the (rigged) state of the playing field.</p>
<p>Here’s the problem: the losers are <em>also</em> deluded about #1 (because the rigged game provides the winners with the necessary resources to delude them through tens of billions of dollars of propaganda and economist-buying).</p>
<p>So here’s the rhetorical challenge faced by those who seek greater equality: convince the losers that much or most of the winners’ success is in fact the result of everyone pulling on ropes together (and luck), <em>not</em> just the winners’ industrious rope-pulling. Not an easy task, but one worth focusing on.</p>
<p>To add, a problem with Haidt’s analysis: if big business and big finance (and rich people) couldn’t buy big government to rig the game in their own favor, big government wouldn’t be the problem. <em>Absent that buy,</em> government is essentially indifferent to relative distributions — or arguably even more inclined to sharing the wealth widely to garner lots of votes — one person one vote versus one dollar one vote.</p>
<p>He suggests a three-way symmetry for a situation that is not symmetrical.<br /><em><br /></em><br /><em>Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=5216">Asymptosis</a>.</em></p>

<p>David Cay Johnston has employed a couple of key graphic images that tell a significant story about the way that US laws have favored the rich&#8211;including tax administrative procedures that have reduced real audits of the rich and tax laws that have cut the top rates significantly and cut the rates on the &#8220;favorite&#8221; form of income of the rich to extraordinarily low rates.  See David Cay Johnston, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/2012/03/15/the-richest-get-richer/">The rich get richer</a>, reuters (Mar. 15, 2012) (noting that the figures he uses here, in 2010 dollars, are from an analysis of IRS data by Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty). [hat tip Francine Lipmann and Tax Prof]<br />
<blockquote>The 1934 economic rebound was widely shared, with strong income gains for the vast majority, the bottom 90 percent.<br />In 2010, we saw the opposite as the vast majority lost ground. National income gained overall in 2010, but all of the gains were among the top 10 percent. Even within those 15.6 million households, the gains were extraordinarily concentrated among the super-rich, the top one percent of the top one percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>So while the Great Depression acted as a leveler, the cascading impact of tax and other fiscal policies that are extraordinarily favorable to the rich was little influenced by the Great Recession.  Here&#8217;re the two telling graphs from the article.</p>
<p><img alt="" height="369" src="http://blogs.reuters.com/david-cay-johnston/files/2012/03/US_AVGINCOMES0312_SC.jpg" title="US_AVGINCOMES0312_SC" width="540"></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Johnston notes that the story in numbers for adjusted gross income is discouraging: <br />
<blockquote>Saez and Piketty show that the vast majority’s average adjusted gross income, of which wages are just a part, was $29,840 in 2010. That was down $127 from 2009 and down $4,842 from 2000.<br />Most shocking? The average income of the vast majority of taxpayers in 2010 was just a smidgen more than the $29,448 average way back in 1966.<br />At the top, the super-rich saw their 2010 average income grow by $4.2 million over 2009 to $23.8 million. Compared to 1966 their income was up on average by $18.7 million per taxpayer.</p></blockquote>
<p>The graphic illustration shows just how much the inequality we see today is from the richest of the rich getting an indecent proportion of income growth. </p>

<p>Is this a problem that needs fixing?  Yes, it clearly is.  We have long recognized the importance of a society where everyone takes part and everyone has at least the minimum essentials for a decent life and a chance for improvement. </p>
<p>A society where a very few &#8220;elite&#8221; at the top garner all the benefits of the system and more and more of the income for themselves is not a sustainable society&#8211;the top becomes predatory, willing to take gains no matter what the cost to everyone else.  It is the kind of attitude that many who are familiar with Wall Street banks have criticized as endemic to Wall Street culture&#8211;and one that was revealed even more starkly by the resignation from Goldman of a star banker who publicly criticized the current culture at Goldman that believes in profits for the firm at the sacrifice of the good of the customer.  See Greg Smith, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/opinion/why-i-am-leaving-goldman-sachs.html">Why I am Leaving Goldman Sachs,</a> New York Times Op-Ed (Mar. 14, 2012).  Shareholders obviously agree with Smith that the &#8220;profit for the firm above care of the client&#8221; mentality is wrong.  See Christine Harper, Goldman <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-15/goldman-stunned-by-op-ed-loses-2-2-billion-for-shareholders.html">Roiled by OpEd Loses 2.2 Billion for Shareholders</a>, Bloomberg (Mar. 15, 2012). </p>
<p>[Goldman is worried&#8211;I got a release from a PR firm suggesting that Goldman&#8217;s profit-making is a boon to the economy and gives its clients great trust in the firm.  I read it and thought&#8211;hmm, misses the point.  Smith isn&#8217;t condemning profit-making per se.  He is condemning profit-making at all costs, and in particular the &#8220;greed is good&#8221; type of profit-making that creates conflicts of interest with the client that is purportedly being served but would as soon eat a client as eat a steak, if money could be made for the firm (and the trader&#8217;s bonus) that way.]</p>
<p>If we want the kind of society that gives everyone a chance to have a decent education, we have to quit running down public schools and diverting public monies to support private religious schools.   Hold schools accountable, but quit the wasteful focus on testing and assessment.  Do a little assessment and a lot more teaching.</p>
<p>If we want a more equal society, then we have to change our tax laws so that they don&#8217;t favor the rich over everybody else.  Reduce the interest deduction, so that leveraged buyouts aren&#8217;t a way to take a stable working company, make a huge profit by borrowing, and then dump it (either in bankruptcy or out of it, but nonetheless yoked with the debt that got the private equity firm rich).  Get rid of provisions that are primarily beneficial to the wealthy&#8211;reinstate a hefty estate tax, eliminate the preferential rate on capital gains, reinstate the phase out of deductions at high income levels, increase the top income tax rate (let the Bush tax cuts lapse in toto or at least for the top earners), phase out the accelerated depreciation schedules, bonus depreciation and expensing provisions, and otherwise return our tax system to a saner progressive model that can support the important basic research at universities and basic public infrastructure development that are the real keys to economic growth.<br />The right has bamboozled the public with its tiresome but endless class warfare rhetoric pushing corporatist policies that claim that tax cuts for wealthy corporations and wealthy individuals are the way to boost growth and help the majority of Americans have good jobs and decent wages.  It&#8217;s a lie.  The way to do that is by moving to a more progressive tax system and providing more government funding for basic research (NIH, NSF, etc.) and for public infrastructure (mass transportation, rails throughout America and its inner cities, urban development). </p>

<p>Does the US Corporate Saving Rate Portend a Lower Unemployment Rate? An interesting thing happened in Q4 2011: the corporate saving rate declined following two quarters of gains. Nominal net saving by the domestic business sector fell 3%, while nominal gross fixed investment and inventories surged 6% – the two pushed the saving rate down nearly 40 bps to 2.94% of GDP. The corporate saving rate (gross saving less gross investment) has been on a downward trend since the end of 2009, a welcomed trend by the labor market.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/corporate_saving_rate_chart.jpg"><img alt="" height="382" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/03/corporate_saving_rate_chart.jpg" width="582"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There’s a very strong correlation between the corporate saving rate and the unemployment rate, 80% according to a simple bivariate OLS regression. I’ve <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/03/its-not-structural-unemployment-its.html">argued in the past</a> that there is some causation to this relationship – but that’s not the point of this post. The point here is that the trend in corporate saving has fallen sufficiently to portend some material declines in the unemployment rate in coming quarters….ALL ELSE EQUAL. For example, a simple bivariate regression would forecast a 7.5% unemployment rate if the corporate saving rate falls another 30 bps to 2.6%.</p>
<p>The all else equal is important. The primary driver of this quarter’s decline in the corporate saving rate was the 6% increase in nominal investment spending, the largest quarterly gain since 2010 Q2. Amid relatively weak manufacturing orders and the expiration of the depreciation allowance, I expect that this momentum is unlikely to be matched in coming quarters. Will firms start drawing down nominal saving to finance new hires?</p>
<p>Better put: will the unemployment rate drop to meet the saving rate? Or will the saving rate rise to meet the unemployment rate?</p>

<p>Public Transit Benefit was down, is now up again (in Senate)</p>
<p>One of the tax provisions that lapsed last year was a very popular tax expenditure supporting public transportation&#8211;a tax credit for commuters using mass transit was allowed to lapse back to a $125 monthly benefit from the stimulus level of $230 a month.  Ironically, in a time of clear importance environmentally of cutting back on cars and increasing use of public transit, Congress had given preferential treatment to support for parking (likely supporting most those commuters at the higher end of the income scale who like to drive their BMWs from Connecticut to New York City, or commuters who don&#8217;t have decent access to public transit):  the parking subsidy actually increased to $240 a month.</p>
<p>Today, the <a href="http://mobile.nationaljournal.com/congress/senate-passes-109-billion-transportation-bill-20120314">Senate passed the Surface Transporation Reauthorization Bill </a>(see summary, <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:SN01813:@@@D&#038;summ2=m&#038;">here</a>; for text and other actions, see <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:s.01813:">S.1813 </a>on Thomas).  The bill as passed included a provision, retroactive to Jan first of this year when credit lapsed to the lower level, that would restore the public transit credit at the same level as the current parking subsidy.  See PR Newswire, Senate <a href="http://m.prnewswire.com/news-releases/senate-approves-increase-to-pre-tax-benefits-for-public-transportation-commuters-142680105.html">Approves Increase to Pre-Tax Benefits for Public Transportation Commuters</a>, Commuter Benefits Work for US.org (Mar. 14, 2012).  The House may delay action on the bill though Boehner has said he would call the Senate version for a vote if the GOP majority doesn&#8217;t agree on an alternative.  See Linda Scott,  <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2012/03/senate-passes-transportation-bill.html">Senate Passes Transportation Bill</a>, PBS NewsHour (Mar. 14, 2012).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to see Congress moving to correct this.  As Sen. Lautenberg noted<br />
<blockquote><strong>“Mass transit boosts the economy, reduces dirty auto emissions and takes cars off our congested roads. We fought hard to include this provision in the bill so that transit riders can enjoy the same benefits as drivers. I&#8217;m pleased that this bill finally appears poised for Senate passage, and I urge the House to follow suit and approve this bill immediately.&#8221; Lautenberg: <a href="http://www.politickernj.com/55516/lautenberg-increased-transit-rider-tax-benefit-would-help-thousands-new-jersey-commuters">Increased transit rider tax benefit would help thousands of New Jersey commuters </a>(Mar. 13, 2012).  </strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Favoring cars over public transit didn&#8217;t make sense except as just another example of the way tax expenditures favor high income taxpayers generally&#8211;the real face of class warfare in the U.S.A. today.  <br />(Though of course, it goes to show that it is much easier to get some kind of tax break through Congress these days&#8211;in spite of the right&#8217;s whining about needing to cut spending&#8211;than it is to enact a reasonable program with expenditures specifically targeted at the purpose  intended.  This is why Obama&#8217;s corporate tax proposal provides a scattershot corporatist oriented reduction in corproate tax rates for &#8220;manufacturers&#8221;, instead of doing what we should do, which is leaving the corporate tax statutory rate where it is, and providing an incentive program for corporations that bring significant numbers of new jobs back to the US.)<br />If you don&#8217;t believe my point about <strong>class warfare</strong>, just look at the way the balance works out between beneficiaries of the various programs that the right likes to refer to as &#8220;entitlements&#8221; and wants to cut, versus the beneficiaries of numerous tax expenditures in the Code that the right seems endlessly willing to extend, increase, and rationalize. </p>
<p>The result is a general pattern of reallocation of resources in ways that amount to<strong>redistribution upwards to those already at the top of the income distribution</strong>.  Looks a lot like rewarding rich Congressional cronies while punishing the poor, the elderly and the vulnerable.  See, e.g.,  Eduardo Porter, A<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/business/a-nation-with-too-many-tax-breaks-economic-scene.html"> Nation With Too Many Tax Breaks</a>, New York Times (Mar. 14, 2012), at B1 (and, off topic but relevant given  Rush Limbaugh&#8217;s despicable slurring of the Georgetown student advocating for full coverage of contraception under the Health Care law, notice that Reagan&#8217;s signing of the 1986 tax reform act was in the middle of a slew of older white males&#8211;not a female in the picture!).  The article compares the distribution of federal benefits (programs like unemployment, Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, housing assistance, and food stamps, but not Pell grants or Veterans Benefits) to the distribution of tax expenditures (exemptions, deductions and credits like the preferential rate on capital gains, the home mortgage interest deduction, and the deduction for charitable contributions). </p>
<p>The federal benefits are much more evenly distributed, though the primary benefit does go to those in the lowest two quintiles (as intended by the nature of the programs).  The bottom 40% of taxpayer families by income group get about 60% of the program benefits.  But the tax expenditures&#8211;all those goodies built into the Code through crony capitalism&#8211;go much more disproportionately to those at the very top of the income distribution:  the top 20% get a whopping 67% of the benefit of tax expenditures, with the second highest quintile getting an additional 14%, adding up to 81% of the benefit going to the top 40% of the income distribution (and this spread may undercount, since it compensates for generally larger taxpaying units in the top income layers).  The lowest 40% get only 11% of the tax expenditures. </p>
<p>There is a good graphic for this, that you can access through <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/03/13/business/Who-Gets-the-Breaks-and-Benefits.html?ref=business">this link</a>.</p>

<blockquote>There has been an ongoing discussion in the econoblogosphere about the usefulness or lack thereof of “microfoundations” in macroeconomics, which in practice means trying to write down models in which aggregate behavior is justified in terms of the actions of utility-maximizing individuals with rational expectations.<br /> &#8230; </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>But bear in mind what we’ve actually seen in academic economics: the development of an ethos in which only microfounded models are considered “real” theory, in which it’s basically impossible to publish a paper unless it’s intertemporal optimization all the way. That’s the kind of dominance a theory is only entitled to if it produces dramatically better predictions than the theory it has crowded out<br />&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Wren-Lewis says he disagrees, but as <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/very-rude-comments.html">Robert Waldmann says</a>, his examples offer <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2012/03/what-have-microfoundations-ever-done.html">very thin gruel</a>. The failure of the commodity price shock to filter into wider inflation? Lots of people predicted this without any appeal to microfoundations, just the observation that wage contracts were no longer indexed and oil as a share of GDP was lower than in the 70s. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The basic picture is that we’ve seen a more or less complete takeover of macro by an approach that hasn’t remotely earned the right to that kind of dominance.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2012/03/thursday-roundup-3152012.html" target="_blank">Noah Smith</a> at <i>Noahpinion</i> has an impressive listing on Thursday&#8217;s Roundup of the many involved in the conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>This week in econ: A bunch of people are talking about philosophy-of-macroeconomics, which I like&#8230;things like microfoundations, rational expectations, bounded rationality, learning, and untested hypotheses. This is just my kind of nerdery! Elsewhere, people are arguing about monetary policy even more than usual. It&#8217;s another day in the ER&#8230;er&#8230;econosphere.. </p></blockquote>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Mark Thoma and Simon Wren-Lewis both responded to a complaint about the rational expectations assumption by noting that they had colleagues who study boundedly rational learning.  I see a third alternative &#8212; giving up.  That is, we might conclude that we don&#8217;t understand expectations formation and that we won&#8217;t for a long while, so we should just decide that economic agents believe the darndest things.   This implies giving up on calculating a conditional probability distribution of future outcomes.  One way to implement the just throw in the towel strategy is to say that there is a 90% probability that a model including the rational expectations hypothesis will predict the future as well as it fit the past and a 10% chance that something weird and unexpected will happen, because economic agents get some strange notion in their heads.</p>
<p>But what is my problem with boundedly rational learning ?  Well first of all actual learning is clearly monstrously complicated (especially when the learners get together and decide to teach each other).  Any model must be a gross simplification which might be a useful approximation and might not.  So we are back to maybe it will work ok and maybe not (and we don&#8217;t know the probabilities). </p>
<p>The worse problem is that the exact model of expectations formation typically matters a lot.  Equally plausible models can have extremely different implications. Equally plausible models which fit the same data equally well can have extremely different implications.  I provide an example.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>One model of boundedly rational learning is that agents choose a specification and estimate coefficients by OLS.  So far we have a really dumb model (like adaptive expectations) such that policy makers can fool all the people all the time.  But wait, the agents test their identifying restrictions &#8212; they consider alternative specifications one of which, with the right coefficients,  happens to be the optimal forecasting rule.  They switch specifications if the currently favored specification is rejected against an alternative specification at the alpha significance level.</p>
<p>This model has the desirable feature that you can&#8217;t fool all of the people all of the time, that is it has the desirable trait of the rational expectations assumption. </p>
<p>OK so an example of the example.  The monetary authority can set the inflation rate except with an iid noise term.  Agents set prices one period in advance based on their forecast of next period&#8217;s price level.  The monetary authority has an ambitious output target (wants to trick people into producing more than they would in the flexible price equilibrium).  Inflation is slightly costly. </p>
<p>If the agents have rational expectations, the best policy is to set inflation to zero.  I assume that the monetary authority can pre-commit, so it would do that.</p>
<p>Now assume agents are the pick a specification and keep it until it is rejected at level alpha against another specification (in a set including the specification which allows rational expectations).  Let&#8217;s say they start with the guess that inflation is a mean zero  white noise (so the best estimate is always 0).  So long as they stick to that specification, the old expectations un-augmented Phillips curve describes the economy.  </p>
<p>The monetary authority can hide in the noise and set inflation above zero for a while.  It will do this.  So what ?</p>
<p>Two things, one of which matters and the other of which is a mathematical joke.</p>
<p>Well first, I haven&#8217;t told you what alpha is, have I. I am sure that if such a model of boundedly rational learning is simulated alpha is set to 5%  cause that&#8217;s just the way we hang.  But what if it were ten to the minus tenth ?  In that case, the optimal policy might be to set expected output to the ambitious target for the next hundred years. The implications for policy are totally different than rational expectations for until we will all be dead.  In particular the implications for any data set we have are totally different.</p>
<p>The critique of models of expectations other than rational expectations is always based on arguments about what happens as t goes to infinity (when we will all be dead).  They don&#8217;t rule out different assumptions which have implications for all time up to 2012 or 2112 which are as different as implications can be.</p>
<p>Second, the optimal monetary policy contains a stochastic term.  The agents estimate the variance of the white noise disturbance to inflation.  If the monetary authority randomly changes it&#8217;s inflation target, it imposes second order costs.  It has a first order effect on the estimate variance of the disturbance term.  This allows it to hide longer under the noise. So the optimal amount of noise to add to inflation is positive.  </p>

                                <p>Simon Wren-Lewis gets me going again</p>
<p>He <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.com/2012/03/rational-expectations-and-phillips.html">wrote</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>Rational expectations do not prevent us understanding sustained periods of deficient demand when an inflation targeting central bank hits a lower bound. Indeed they help, because with rational expectations inflation targeting prevents inflation expectations delivering the real interest rate we need, as I have argued here.</p></blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote><p>The traditional Phillips curve has always seemed to me to be an advertisement for the dangers of not doing microfoundations. It seems plausible enough, which is why it was used routinely before the rational expectations revolution. But it contains the serious flaw noted above, which almost destroyed Keynesian economics.</p></blockquote>
<p>After the jump, two very rude comments (in anti chronological order)</p>
<p>update: welcome Krugman readers.  Oddly I kept secret the really rude comment which attempts to support the thin gruel claim as made by Krugman (I e-mailed it to myself).  I think I will try to keep it secret (but I mean how the hell did Krugman know I had written a thin gruel comment ?  ) Anyway I put a semi almost not totally utterly rude version as a comment on his post and below so now there are 3 comments in anti chronological order.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>update:<br />the very rude comments I posted are nothing like the rude comment I decided to e-mail myself instead.  In particular, they don&#8217;t contain much of the thin gruel  claim. I think I will summarize the ones I didn&#8217;t post.</p>
<p>Wren-Lewis discussed changes in Central bank independence and explicit or implicit inflation targets.</p>
<p>When claiming one has evidence, one really can&#8217;t use the word &#8220;implicit.&#8221;   Explicit inflation targets are observable variables.  The claim that, without an explicit target, the Fed targeted inflation certainly isn&#8217;t an explanatory variable (and is hard to reconcile with FOMC minutes) .  I&#8217;d guess the conclusion that there was an implicit target is based on the fact that inflation stayed at roughly the same level.  If so, the evidence is that in cases where inflation stayed at roughly the same level, inflation stayed at roughly the same level.</p>
<p>There has been no change in the legal independence of the Fed.  Yet US inflation was high in the 70s and low in the naughties.   Again there isn&#8217;t a pattern relating observable variables with outcomes.  </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t add that 1973  -1968 = only 5 years.  In many countries, workers didn&#8217;t accept that they had to live with capitalists.  Unions were more powerful and vastly more militant.    One might ask if one can explain differences in inflation rates by looking at difference in labor movements.  For example, one might as Colin Crouch.</p>
<p>End update:</p>
<p>You write (suspected typo elided) &#8220;inflation targeting &#8230; delivering the real interest rate we need.&#8221;  I note that the ECB has consistently targetted inflation (at least you are willing to give inflation targetting credit for events in 2005 and 2006.  You must conclude that the Eurozone has the real interest rate we need.  </p>
<p>But the Eurozone suffered a severe recession, currently has extremely high unemployment and appears to be headed for a second dip. </p>
<p>I think you meant to qualify the claim with &#8220;with the right inflation target, assuming (for some reason) that the target is credible &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>I too have semi defended the rational expectations assumption recently.  However, the basic advantage I see is that the assumption of rational expectations makes it more difficult (not impossible) for people to tell stories about how their preferred policies are good, because (it is assumed rather than argued) they will influence expectations in a desirable way.  </p>
<p>Briefly, I think the point is to exorcise the confidence fairy.  Less briefly, my reasoning was that, if one is not required to assume rational expectations, one can argue that cutting spending will cause increased growth by increasing business confidence.  A model in which businessmen with rational expectations increase investment and production because of a spending cut is not easy to write.  My guess is that it would be a model with sunspot equilibria, so anything can change investment.  If so the case for expansionary austerity would be identical to the case that what we need is to burn incense to the flying spaghetti monster (which claim is consistent with the rational expectations assumption on models where sunspots can matter).  </p>
<p>The key question, I think, is not rational vs irrational. It isn&#8217;t even rational vs adaptive.  It is whether we should treat expectations as a policy variable imagining that policy makers can control them as they control, say, the federal funds rate.  </p>
<p>Then I thought &#8220;same for the people who think that expected inflation is just like the federal funds rate&#8221; and here we are.  I might add, I also thought &#8220;this time I won&#8217;t be very rude in comment&#8221; really honestly.  But, as I see it, you leave me no choice.</p>
<p>Look why not just talk about a monetary authority which targets real yearly GDP.  To a million pounds per capital  You are simply assuming that a central bank can get the inflation expectations it wants.  That rational people will believe its dynamically inconsistent promises.  </p>
<p>Oddly the last time I remember defending rational expectations was when I tried to explain (to Matthew Yglesias) why Paul Krugman was skeptical about the effectiveness of monetary policy right now. </p>
<p>I note again that you have not identified one advance new Keynesians have made beyond Keynes.  The alleged examples include speculation about UK consumption some of which, you note, is not incorporated into new Keynesian models yet and none of which has yielded an improved prediction and, of course, the old Phillips curve.  The only connection between the old Phillips curve and Keynes is that he warned against believing in it as clearly as anyone could writing before Phillips.</p>
<p>You contest Krugman&#8217;s claim that those who seek microfoundations have had no successes since the critique of the old Phillips curve yet you go back to that again and again.  I see no trace of a justification for your disagreement with Krugman in this post or in any other post of yours which I have read.</p>
