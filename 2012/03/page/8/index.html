                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/03/03/rush-limbaugh-sandra-fluke-and-why-is-contraception-part-of-health-insurance-anyway/">this Forbes article</a>,  Tim Worstall says he agrees with generally available birth control, but  questions why health insurance should pay for it.    Specifically he  says:  &#8220;<i>But I really cannot see the point of trying to have health care  insurance which then covers a multitude of treatments that aren’t really  insurable matters, contraception being just one of these (regular  shots, ‘flu vaccines, general everyday low level treatments in fact).</i>&#8221;  This is after he points out that, per Wikipedia, &#8220;<i>Insurance is a form of risk management primarily used to hedge against the risk of a contingent, uncertain loss.</i>&#8220;</p>
<p>The  first question this prompts in my mind regarding insuring against  (unwanted) pregnancy is what loss does that pregnancy entail?  The  answer is large measures of personal freedom, hundreds of thousands of  dollars in unplanned child-rearing expenses, and quality of life for the  potential child resulting from the pregnancy.  These are significant  risks, with <a href="http://www.prochoiceforum.org.uk/psy_ocr2.php">ramifications for society at large</a>,  involving the employability and  productivity (in a purely economic  sense) of the involved woman, and her uses of discretionary income.   Furthermore, unwanted children, particularly if the mother is single,  are more liable to live in poverty and neglect, suffer from illness and  abuse, become delinquent, and develop into adults that are  psychologically disturbed, draw welfare, and commit crimes.</p>
<p>So, there are significant personal hardships and costly negative externalities that result form unwanted pregnancies.  </p>
<p>Is it ironic that in the past right-wingers have proposed the <a href="http://mississippiappendectomy.wordpress.com/2007/11/19/black-women-in-the-1960s-and-1970s/">forced sterilization of welfare mothers</a>?  </p>
<p>Also, the hormone therapy we call &#8220;birth control&#8221; has many other preventive medial uses, including controlling <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001913/">endometriosis</a>.  So a focus in the merely contraceptive attributes is misplaced.</p>
<p>Currently,  more than half the states mandate that hormonal birth control be  included in prescription coverage, and since 1998, this coverage has  been included for all federal employees.  There is ample precedent for  this coverage, and insurance companies are well equipped to handle it.</p>
<p>Worstall conducts this thought experiment.</p>
<blockquote><p> Just to make up some numbers, say that the preferred method costs $30 a  month. But that having the contraception covered by insurance will raise  the premium by $50 a month. The insurance company does, after all, have  certain costs associated with taking the premium then paying it  straight back out again to buy the pill. Why would anyone do this? Why  not purchase the pill for $30, stiff the insurance company bureaucrats  the $20 and spend it on a couple of cocktails at a place where you might  meet someone who thinks that your being a contraceptive user is a good  idea?</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, when you&#8217;re  just making up numbers, its easy to have them suit whatever fell purpose  you have in mind.  Suppose a much more realistic <a href="http://www.healthinsurancerates.com/56-birth-control-and-health-insurance.html">$16 per month</a>, and the whole make-believe argument  collapses.</p>
<p>Besides,  in terms of brute economics, the insurance company is better off paying  for decades of contraception in $30 increments than one avoidable  pregnancy at many thousands of dollars, if everything goes smoothly.    Let&#8217;s just say you can&#8217;t count on that.  </p>
<p>So far, this has been a basically economic argument.  Now let&#8217;s look at an issue of fairness and parity.  <a href="http://www.healthinsurancerates.com/56-birth-control-and-health-insurance.html">More than half of the prescription programs cover Viagra</a>.   Need I say more?</p>
<p>Worstall&#8217;s  argument has some logical consistency &#8211; he seems opposed to insurance  coverage of other types of preventive care.  But this is ignorant and  short-sighted.  A flu-shot is less than $25.  An office call is $90 and  up.  Prevention, in general,  is cheap, and treatment is expensive.  If  cost minimization is your goal, then the clear focus should be on  prevention.</p>
<p>Worstall&#8217;s problem, I think, is in relating  contraception to a free-market business model, though, as I have  indicated, he isn&#8217;t even understanding that properly.  The proper focus  also includes the high costs of the externalities that he conveniently  ignores.</p>
<p>The real root problem though, is in trying to  force-fit any health insurance system into a for-profit model.  There is  simply no way to reconcile the conflicting goals of profit maximization  and providing the needed services.  In fact, there are only three  avenues to profit maximization: raise premiums, deny coverage, or  emphasize prevention.</p>
<p>Whether this leads to the  conclusion that a single payer, government mandated program is the best  overall approach is left as an exercise for the interested reader.</p>
<p>UPDATE: I forgot the great positive externality of contraception &#8211; it prevents hundreds of thousands of abortions every year.</p>

<div></div>
<div>Today we are continuing to look at the historical tax tables to see how we viewed and possibly defined rich.  I introduced this idea with my post: <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/define-rich-part-iii-what-tax-tables-of.html">Defining Rich III</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I found a source for all sorts of historical data from the <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html">Census Bureau</a>.  You can down load it or the better way is to click on the PDF file which brings up the Intro and then click on any of the listings of the table of contents which takes you to that set of PDF data.  For this posting regarding income data I am using <a href="http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1937-13.pdf">this section</a>.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>The average weekly income for all manufacturing was $22.82 per week on 39.1 hours work.  The highest paid was printing/publishing newspapers/periodicals at $35.15 per week on 37 hours work.  The lowest was cotton goods at $13.80 per week on 37.5 hours of work.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>In the non-manufacturing sector the I calculated the average weekly income to be $23.76 on 40.28 hours of work.  The highest earnings were electric power/lights manufactured gas at $31.70 per week on 40.2 hours work.  The lowest was hotels at $13.97 per week on 48.3 hours of work.    For the Walmart greeter retail trade-general merchandising it was $17.51 per week on 40.8 hours work.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There were regional differences also.  The most glaring is the north/south difference.  The hourly wage ranges from 12.5 cents to 19 cents less if you worked in the south.  The greatest differences being between the East South Central and the Pacific North.  </div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>The data uses an average of 1923 to 1925 to equal 100% for comparisons.  Thus, 1936 weekly earnings were 89.7 % of that standard however they were 109.9 % adjusted for cost of living.  Things were looking up having hit their lows in 1933.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Using my <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/index.php">favorite money converter</a> and to not let the numbers become to many and thus cause one&#8217;s mind to go blank, I converted the average hourly wage for the four categories listed:</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7FzQWjwM8C8/T1OHwyv0cpI/AAAAAAAAASI/T3BmhKZ1WQM/s1600/1936+Hourly+pay+Converted.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7FzQWjwM8C8/T1OHwyv0cpI/AAAAAAAAASI/T3BmhKZ1WQM/s320/1936+Hourly+pay+Converted.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>Thus we have an annual income ranging from a high of $1827.80 per year for the newspaper worker to $717.60 per year for the cotton goods worker.   These are the numbers you need to keep in mind as we look at the 1936 tax tables.  These are the numbers that let us start to understand what we used to  </div>
<div>consider rich.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The lowest tax rate in 1936 is 4% on incomes up to $4000.   This $4000 appears to capture  the income of the vast majority of workers in the nation in 1936.    Remember, this income that is taxed is already adjusted for any deductions.  Thus, if after all your deductions you had $4000 left over, you paid 4% of that in federal income tax.  You paid $160 in taxes.    Today, using the converted average income a person would be paying up to 15% of their adjusted income for federal income taxes.  They would be paying 25% if they were receiving the equivalent share of GDP/capita.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The highest rate in 1936 is 79% on income over $5,000,000.  OH MY GOD!  Don&#8217;t panic folks.  Converted as unskilled labor, this is $188,000,000 of adjusted gross income.  That is a freakn&#8217; pile of money after all deductions are taken.  Still, I&#8217;m sure some are thinking I must be a real soak the rich kind of guy to brush off 79%.  Here&#8217;s the thing.  It&#8217;s a very big thing.  VERY BIG THING.  This person is only paying that 79% on any money above the $5,000,000 after all deductions.   They spent all the money they believed their business (s) needed, they gave all they wanted to charity, they took the housing credits, subtracted any losses on capital gains, gave to their children and any other activity that would subtract money from their gross income.  When it was all done, that person still had $5,000,000 left over to be taxed at 79% and it is only that $1 (ONE DOLLAR) which put their income at $5,000,000 that will be taxed at 79%.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>What we have forgotten, or have failed to honestly accept is that the old way of producing a tax schedule did not tax at a constant rate from the first dollar.  Each time you broke into a new “tax bracket” only that money within that tax bracket was taxed at the brackets given rate.  Thus, the higher up the tax rate ladder one was, the smaller their actual percentage of income paid for taxes became relative to the indexes specified rate.  Frankly what this means is that the only person paying the full bracketed rate is the person at the bottom of the table.  If you were in the 4% bracket, you paid a full 4% of your ADJUSTED gross income to the federal government.   How convenient for those arguing to “simplify” the tax system that a huge portion of the tax paying public pays the full indexed rate and thus when you talk to them about a 79% tax rate they are prone to interpret that rate as being paid on all the money they earned. Ouch!  How to move a populous made simple. </div>
<div></div>
<div>There were 33  brackets in 1936.  When people talked about the “complexity” of the tax system they used to be talking about how many brackets there were.  After all, the goal of the complainers is to get the “system” down to the lowest single rate they can buy.  Interestingly enough, there is a flat rate in the 1936 table.  You just had to be willing to really work hard to earn an income large enough to receive such a rate.  It&#8217;s the top rate.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>The following chart shows how this works.  It is a chart of the percentages of the marginal rate verse the actual rate paid.  Notice how there is a bulge in the middle.  Those people got the biggest built in break from the marginal rate.  I don&#8217;t know how to figure out how many people were within the bracket range of number 7 to 23, but it would be interesting to see if this was what we would consider the middle class.</div>

<div>What all this comes down to is a chart that looks as follows:</div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t_FIS6h4jFE/T1OIZ4bE8bI/AAAAAAAAASY/3vWOhS8t9CY/s1600/1936+Tax+Table+Graph.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="235" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-t_FIS6h4jFE/T1OIZ4bE8bI/AAAAAAAAASY/3vWOhS8t9CY/s320/1936+Tax+Table+Graph.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>Notice that once we get to the 25th bracket the individual is paying more than 50% of their income in taxes.  For shame people will say.  How dare We the People take so much from that person.  It&#8217;s stealing!  NOT!</div>

<div></div>
<div>First, at the 25<sup>th</sup> bracket the adjusted gross income in today&#8217;s unskilled labor value is $9,420,000 per year.  Remember, ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME.  All deductions have been taken.  There is nothing at this income that one could not have had at $7,540,000 (the converted income that taxes less than 50%) that is not just more of what they already have.</div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Second, at this level of income no one is doing it solely on their own.  What we used to understand is that there is a point of income earning that stops being do to one&#8217;s labor and moves to being simply the capture of a greater share of the income earned off the commons.  Haven&#8217;t hear that term “commons”.  Ask a person <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_commons">from Massachusetts</a>.  In the case of income, it is the money earned as a results of all the investments We the<br />People have made.  In practice if you own a business and have employees, the road you used to get to your business  is used by all the employees and thus you have received a share of their share of the use of the road.  You have received a greater share of the road&#8217;s effect on economic activity without doing any extra work.  You only had to pay your taxes&#8230;just like all your employees in order to have that road in place for your use.  I believe this is why there was a point in the 1936 tax table at which your tax paid became greater than 50% and climbed steeply until you rang the income bell at which time your were rewarded with a flat rate on everything earned beyond the bell&#8217;s posted height.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Third, at this level of income the Constitution&#8217;s prime objective kicks in: equality of power.  We are living the effects of having been taught away from this effect of money.  I refer you back to my series looking at taxation from a justice perspective.  Starting <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/01/opus-1-discussion-on-taxation.html">here</a> going on <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/01/opus-1-second-movement-on-taxation.html">here</a> and<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/02/opus-finale-discussion-on-taxation.html"> finishing here</a>.  I&#8217;ll just let what I ended that series with be my overall thoughts on why power and thus justice need to be part of the taxation discussion: </div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>As a professional, I can understand the argument to separate the two issues via 2 professions. The concept of a profession is that it is specialized. As a thinking person and a citizen, the public discussion should not allow the issue of efficiency to dominate one profession&#8217;s focus while the issue of equity dominates another profession. We have to assure both equity and efficiency are discussed and decided upon in order to stay true to the preamble of the Constitution and minimize Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s observation of the citizens response.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>There is one major point to learn from the charts above.  If you want a progressive system, you need many tax brackets.  The more steps there are the more fair and specifically addressed is any particular level of income.   To compare the charts of 1936 to 2010, you can view the<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lX4293efG5Y/Tl_Efh3ab1I/AAAAAAAAARc/W7X0lIr0Ki0/s1600/2010+Tax+table+Define+Rich+3.JPG"> 2010 table here</a> and <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OCqtKMLzE3A/Tl_Ejt_NFtI/AAAAAAAAARg/bwU8IixjaGc/s1600/2010+Tax+rate+graph+Define+Rich+3.JPG">the graph here</a>.</div>

<p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/02/wealth-and-antisocial-behavior-reverse.html">Wealth and Antisocial Behavior: Reverse Causality?</a></p>
<p>There is quite a bit of buzz about <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/02/21/1118373109.abstract">this just-prepublished article</a> in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i>. Here is the abstract:<br />
<blockquote>Seven studies using experimental and naturalistic methods reveal that upper-class individuals behave more unethically than lower-class individuals. In studies 1 and 2, upper-class individuals were more likely to break the law while driving, relative to lower-class individuals. In follow-up laboratory studies, upper-class individuals were more likely to exhibit unethical decision-making tendencies (study 3), take valued goods from others (study 4), lie in a negotiation (study 5), cheat to increase their chances of winning a prize (study 6), and endorse unethical behavior at work (study 7) than were lower-class individuals. Mediator and moderator data demonstrated that upper-class individuals’ unethical tendencies are accounted for, in part, by their more favorable attitudes toward greed.</p></blockquote>
<p>The tone of the first wave of commentary, as far as I can tell, is that we knew it all along—rich people are nasty. I would like to put in a word, however, for the other direction of causality, that dishonesty and putting one’s own interests ahead of others are conducive to wealth. I certainly don’t mean this deterministically; there are lots of stone-broke cheats and chiselers out there. Nevertheless, at many key moments of life people face a choice, whether to shade a bit and advance their own career, or remain honest and end up back in the pack. Do you take credit for someone else’s work in order to get a promotion? Do you leave out some information that would reduce the likelihood of a sale that would make you a tidy profit? And if you find yourself in a zero-sum situation where your gain is someone else’s loss (or more gain for you means less gain for them), do you push your advantage as hard as you can?  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The reason I bring this up is because there is a constant background murmur in our society that says that greater wealth <i>has</i> to be a reward for more talent, more effort or more contribution to society. When Steve Jobs died, he was a poster child for this view. Yeah, he was something of a jerk, but he gave us all those great gadgets, and that’s why he was so rich. Could it be, however, that among all those whose intelligence, creativity and obsessive toil drives progress, what separates the Steve Jobs from the Unknown Nerd is the bundle of personal traits that add up to claiming for oneself alone the contribution of everyone else? There are a lot of people who could never imagine raking in billions while those who do the physical work in China are driven to, or past, the brink of suicide. They won’t get to be CEO. Nor would the people taking in the super-bonuses at Citi, G-S, BoA and the rest be where they are if they put as much energy into making sure mortgage borrowers were treated legally and fairly as they do into squeezing a little more profit into the kitty.<br />  <br />Maybe the reason a lot of people are vulnerable in this economy is that they’re too damned decent. Between, say, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/13/business/turning-the-dialogue-from-wealth-to-values.html?pagewanted=print">Tyler Cowen</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nice_guy">Leo Durocher</a>, who do you think has a better handle on how the world really works?  </p>

<p>It&#8217;s Almost April so Tax Tips Are Flowering</p>
<p>You can tell when it is getting close to the April filing deadline for individual calendar-year taxpayers. All of the major tax firms release their &#8220;handy tax tips&#8221; to entice new clients for this tax season.<br />The <a href="http://www.aicpa.org/Pages/Default.aspx">American Institute of CPA&#8217;s</a> handy tips (released Mar.1, 2012) include some helpful reminders that taxpayers should claim deductions they are entitled too but shouldn&#8217;t be piggy and claim deductions&#8211;like the home office deduction&#8211;that they aren&#8217;t entitled to.
<ol>
<li>Expenses. &#8220;Keep a daily diary.&#8221; </li>
<li>Deductions. Take advantage of all of the deductions to which you are legally entitled. &#8220;The most common deductions for small business owners include entertainment, travel, meals, capital assets, home office and health insurance. Travel miles, meals and entertainment deductions require that you maintain a diary with daily entries that tie into receipts and other records.&#8221; </li>
<li>Traps. &#8220;[C]laiming deductions that exceed your income for more than one year is a definite red flag. The home office deduction, which is allowable only under specific circumstances, may be another red flag.&#8221; </li>

<li>Equipment. &#8220;For tax years beginning in 2011, a small business may deduct up to $500,000 in equipment purchases as long as the business spends $2 million or less for equipment for the year.&#8221; </li>
<li>Payroll. &#8220;One of the most common and costly tax-related problems for small business owners is that they use the payroll taxes withheld from employees to finance business operations. Not only does the IRS often go after a small business owner’s personal assets to collect the unpaid payroll taxes, but also it may attempt to assess significant penalties.&#8221; In other words, those taxes you&#8217;ve withheld aren&#8217;t your money to spend&#8211;you are collecting on behalf of the government and must turn them over.</li>
<li>Insurance. &#8220;If you have health insurance coverage for your employees, check to see if you are eligible for the small business health care tax credit. The <a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=223666,00.html">IRS website</a> has a page describing the credit, eligibility requirements and how to claim it. &#8221; </li>
<li>Veterans. There&#8217;s a credit for employers who hire veterans. The <a href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=253949,00.html">IRS website</a> has details. </li>
<li>Contributions. &#8220;Be sure to get a valuation for any non-cash items your business donates to charity&#8221; </li>
<li>Help. &#8220;If you are unsure about anything related to your tax obligations under the law, you should seek professional help &#8220;</li>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><img title="laffer napkin" src="http://rationalwiki.org/w/images/5/50/Laffer_napkin.jpg" alt="" width="269" height="202"><br />Anti-taxers love to haul out the legendary napkin-inscribed Laffer curve to demonstrate that lower taxes would yield more government revenue. But this ploy only works because they <em>assume</em> that we’re at or past the high point — that higher taxes would move us down the right slope. (Note the cross-marks-the-spot in the image here?)
<p>But where are we really, relative to that high point? James Kwak <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/02/27/how-much-do-taxes-matter/">gives us</a> an answer, based on a great recent <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w17860">paper</a> by Christina and David Romer (emphasis, interjections, mine):</p>
<blockquote><p>…an [income] elasticity of 0.19 [from the Romer paper] implies that <strong>tax revenues would be maximized with a tax rate of 84 percent</strong>; that is, you could raise taxes up to 84 percent before people’s reduced incentives to make money would compensate for the higher tax rates.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is obviously not to say that we should be taxing at that level — only that Laffer-curve arguments are ridiculous because we’re nowhere near the high point.</p>
<p>Kwak adds another key insight about the paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>Second, remember that <strong>this is a study of the super-rich</strong>: not the top 1%, but the top 0.05%. These are the people whom one would expect to have the highest income elasticity, precisely because they don’t need the marginal dollar. <strong>Elasticities tend to be lower for ordinary people</strong> because they need to cover their expenses.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So we’re even father from the peak than suggested by the .19 elasticity.</p>
<p>Takeaway:</p>
<blockquote><p>…<strong>when you raise taxes on the rich, they don’t stop trying to make money</strong>: they just pay their lawyers and accountants more to avoid paying taxes.</p>

                                <p>Modern Macroeconomic Methodology</p>
<p>Seems to be quite the topic <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/the-microfoundation-thing-wonkish/">yesterday</a>.  I wrote this about a week ago and maybe it&#8217;s time to post it.</p>
<p>Modern Macroeconomic Methodology (MMM) rests on two pillars:  Milton Friedman&#8217;s methodology of positive economics and the Lucas critique.  The problem is that an alternative possible title for &#8220;Econometric Policy Evaluation: A Critique&#8221; is &#8220;The Methodology of Positive Economics: A Critique.&#8221;  One of the pillars consistgs essentially of the claim that the other is unsound.  </p>
<p>How can two opposite claims both support the same theoretical edifice ?  I think it is very simple, Friedman&#8217;s methodology for me, the Lucas critique for thee.  </p>
<p>I argue my claims at boring length <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2012/03/modern-macroeconomic-methodology-modern.html">over at my personal blog</a>.</p>

                                <div>Highlights <a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2012/02/29/butt_sisters_are_safe_from_newt_and_rick">from the transcript </a>of Rush Limbaugh’s <i>uber</i>-viral Wednesday diatribe against <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/meet-sandra-fluke-the-woman-you-didnt-hear-at-congress-contraceptives-hearing/2012/02/16/gIQAJh57HR_blog.html">Sandra Fluke</a> (in case y’all missed it):
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>What does it say about the college co-ed Sandra Fluke, who goes before a congressional committee and essentially says that she must be paid to have sex, what does that make her? It makes her a slut, right? It makes her a prostitute. She wants to be paid to have sex. She&#8217;s having so much sex she can&#8217;t afford the contraception. She wants you and me and the taxpayers to pay her to have sex. What does that make us? We&#8217;re the pimps. (interruption) The johns? We would be the johns? No! We&#8217;re not the johns. (interruption) Yeah, that&#8217;s right. Pimp&#8217;s not the right word. Okay, so she&#8217;s not a slut. She&#8217;s &#8220;round heeled.&#8221; I take it back.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And:
</p>
</div>
<div>Well, I guess now we know why Bill Clinton went to Georgetown and why Hillary went to Wellesley. Well, all the sex going on at Georgetown. Sandra Fluke. So much sex going on, they can&#8217;t afford birth control pills. She said that to Nancy Pelosi yesterday. Pelosi probably said, &#8220;Have you heard what Botox costs? I can relate!&#8221; 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/rush-limbaugh-should-apologize-to-sandra-fluke/2012/03/02/gIQAo9gqmR_story.html">And</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div>So, Miss Fluke, and the rest of you feminazis, here’s the deal. If we are going to pay for your contraceptives . . . we want something for it. We want you to post the videos online so we can all watch.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Expressions of disgust by, well, everyone have flooded the news media and the general web.  But, to my knowledge, no one’s asked why Limbaugh thinks “we” will be paying for Fluke’s, or other Catholic university students’, contraceptives.  Or (presumably) why he thinks “we” will be paying for the contraceptives of employees covered under employer-provided healthcare insurance, whether at Catholic universities, hospitals and charities, or elsewhere. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>The government doesn’t pay student medical insurance premiums; the students do.  Nor does the government pay the medical insurance premiums of employees at any of the other employers who will be obligated under the ACA to provide minimum healthcare benefits; the employer and the employee together do.  <i>That</i>, of course, is what’s caused all the controversy about whether it violates freedom-of-religion guarantees of the government to require that the healthcare insurance that Catholic universities hospitals and charities provide their employees include contraception.  If the government were paying these premiums, this controversy wouldn’t exist.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>So Limbaugh’s statement directed at Sandra Fluke was vile, but it wasn’t just about Fluke and other students at Catholic colleges.  It targeted <i>all</i> women whose healthcare insurance, via premiums, covers contraception.  Limbaugh called them all sluts and prostitutes, and wants them to post videotapes of the sex lives in exchange for their school’s or employer’s, and their own, payments of premiums.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>*UPDATE: Limbaugh has now issued what he characterizes as an apology to Fluke for calling her a “slut” and a “prostate,” saying that the words were ill-advised and that he didn’t intend them as directed personally at her.  Earlier today, Fluke had said she’s considering suing him for libel.
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/limbaugh-apologizes-to-law-student-for-insult-says-he-intended-no-personal-attack/2012/03/03/gIQAz53LpR_print.html">Washington Post article</a> about Limbaugh’s statement quotes him as saying, yesterday:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Amazingly, when there is the slightest bit of opposition to this new welfare entitlement being created, then all of a sudden we hate women. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>According to the Post, his statement today, a rambling press release, says:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I personally do not agree that American citizens should pay for these social activities.  What happened to personal responsibility and accountability? Where do we draw the line? If this is accepted as the norm, what will follow? Will we be debating if taxpayers should pay for new sneakers for all students that are interested in running to keep fit?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So even as late as this evening when he released the statement, he’s claiming that <i>taxpayers</i>would be paying the part of employee and student healthcare premiums that cover contraceptives.  And that taxpayers pay for running pants, shorts and tank tops for employees and students who jog, but don’t pay for the Nikes and Reeboks. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Weird.

                                <p>Barry Ritholtz, who generally knows better, <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/03/isda-suckers-wanted/">blew a gasket at ISDA</a> for yesterday&#8217;s ruling that Greek bonds are not yet in default.  Specifically,<br />
<blockquote>
<blockquote>&#8220;The International Swaps and Derivatives Association said on Thursday that based on current evidence the Greek bailout would not prompt payments on the credit default swaps.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>></p>
<p>Here is a question for the crowd: Exactly how brain damaged, foolish and stupid must a trader be to ever buy one of these embarrassingly laughable instruments called derivatives?</p>
<p>The claim that Greece has not defaulted — despite refusing to make good on their obligations in full or on time — is utterly laughable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s sidebar the reality—that there is no true &#8220;market&#8221; for CDS in general, let alone Sovereign Debt CDS; Donald R. van Deventer of Kamakura Corporation has been all over this, both <a href="http://www.kamakuraco.com/Blog.aspx">on his blog</a> and especially <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/dvandeventer">on Twitter</a>—and just note that ISDA made the correct decision.</p>
<p>Greece has not, to borrow Barry&#8217;s phrase, &#8220;refus[ed] to make good on their obligations in full or on time.&#8221; ISDA did not declare a Default Event yesterday because there has not yet been a Default Event.</p>
<p>Default Event is a very specific term. The sample in <a href="http://www.tavakolistructuredfinance.com/index.html">Janet Tavakoli</a>&#8216;s <em><a href="http://www.booksamillion.com/product/9780471412663?id=4214424925428">Credit Derivatives and Synthetic Structures</a></em> (a book to which I <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/02/in-other-news-larry-king-is-selling.html">have</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/roubinis-not-wrong-but.html">referred</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/01/third-time-someone-will-believe.html">before</a> and undoubtedly will again) runs pretty much three full pages (pp. 88-91).  But the general concept is straightforward: there is a minimum threshold (say, 10% of an issue), the principal or interest due of which the entity explicitly refuses to pay or fails to pay that then materially impacts the buyer of Credit Protection (CDS).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Greece has not yet refused to pay anything.*</p>
<p>There is a payment due on 20 March—19 days still in the future. The financial markets—heck, everyone who runs a diner in Queens—may well believe that no payment will be made on 20 March, but that hasn&#8217;t happened yet.  And the Greek government specifically has <em>not</em> said it won&#8217;t make the payment; it has said, &#8220;Hey, take these bonds instead.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is true that, <em>cet. par.</em>, the market value of the bonds being offered is about 25% the supposed economic value of the current ones. So anyone taking the deal would have to be assuming that the <em>market</em> value of the current bonds is somewhere around 25, just as the French and German banks have them marked.</p>
<p>The market may also agree that one of the reasons people may well accept the offer is that, otherwise, they expect that the Greeks <em>will</em> default on the current bonds.  </p>
<p>But they haven&#8217;t yet, and this is not <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0181689/">Minority Report</a> (though we can all agree Phil Dick would recognize, if not approve of, the current financial world).</p>
<p>So ISDA correctly ruled—the key phrase is &#8220;based on current evidence&#8221;—that there is not yet a Default Event.  If everyone says &#8220;we will tender our securities due 20 March for the exchange offered,&#8221; there will not be a default of those bonds.</p>
<p>You, I, and Bill Gross can all agree that the likelihood of this happening is about equal to the chance that Rick Perry will be elected U.S. President this year.  But there has not been a Default Event.</p>
<p>Wait two or three weeks.</p>
<p>The thing Barry most overlooks is that yesterday&#8217;s ISDA ruling is, if anything, <em>good</em> for CDS buyers.</p>
<p>What will be the economic difference of waiting to holders of the CDSes?  I don&#8217;t know for certain, but if you&#8217;re looking at the standard ISDA CDS contract, there&#8217;s a reasonable assumption that (1) the market price of the bond will not change for the better and (2) it is a certainty that the Accrued Interest on the bond will be greater when they declare a Default Event than it is now.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: in a standard CDS, declaration of default <em>terminates the contract</em>. Accruals end, market pricing is to be determined by calling a few dealers, and the only thing left is to go through the pockets and look for loose change.**</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s ISDA ruling means the CDS buyers will be owed more Accrued Interest when (in two, or at most three, weeks) a Default Event is declared.</p>
<p>What about the principal repayment due?  Recall again that the payment due is generally the net of the current market price <em>subtracted from</em> the initial principal amount (assumed to be par—100—but in any event greater than the current market value).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m inclined to argue there is optimism in the current market that will not be there in two weeks: it&#8217;s not that liquid a market, there is a floor on the price of the economic equivalent of the new offer, and there is time value in the option to convert.***</p>
<p>If ISDA had declared default yesterday—that is, assumed that Greece wasn&#8217;t just &#8220;mostly dead&#8221;****—they would have taken the current market price [P<sub>0</sub>]. Even before the delays and roundelays, that was likely to be greater than the market price of those bonds in a week or two[P<sub>1</sub>, when default is declared.</p>
<p>That is, P<sub>0</sub> is greater than P<sub>1</sub>. And since the payment due is based on [100*****-P<sub>t</sub>], the principal amount due to CDS holders when default is declared will also be greater.</p>
<p>ISDA followed the letter of the contract: the Greeks have not yet defaulted on an obligation, nor have they stated that they intend to do so.  When they do—there are few, if any, in the market who would treat the clause as a possible &#8220;If&#8221;—a Default Event will be declared and the CDS contracts will be expected to pay as they are due. And that payment will, in all likelihood, be higher than the payment that would have been due if ISDA had ruled differently yesterday.</p>
<p>And if they don&#8217;t, then I&#8217;ll be agreeing with Barry that the whole thing was a scam from the start—though I would still argue that JPMorganChaseBear stealing more than $1,000,000,000 in customer funds from MF Global clients is a bigger one, which is something like saying that coprophagia is even worse in liquid form.</p>
<p>When the CDS contracts actually have to be paid, then the fun will begin. If potential for insolvency is your idea of fun. But that&#8217;s another story.</p>
<p>*They have seen S&#038;P downgrade their credit rating, but that&#8217;s a separate issue.</p>
<p>**Obligatory reference.  It will pay off.</p>
<p>***The Worst Case scenario is that you assume the new bonds are the only value in the transaction, and discount their value back over the cost of basically two-week money. The best case scenario is some combination of the price of the new bonds and expectations of either getting a better deal later and/or post-litigation gains.  The lattice may be ugly, but it yields an expected value higher than the Worst Case, and therefore higher than the market price of the bonds as the time to exercise approaches.</p>
<p>****See ** above.</p>
<p>*****Or the other initial contract price; in any case, a fixed value greater than P<sub>t</sub>.</p>

                                <p><strong>Health Care Thoughts: Assaults on Nurses &#8211; Celebrity Edition</strong><br /> <br />by <strong>Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt</strong><br />(updated author to clarify)</p>
<p>Assaults on nurses are a growing problem, with emergency department nurses in the most danger, followed closely by nurses caring for the mentally ill, substance abusers and elderly patients with dementia problems.    </p>
<p>It takes a Kennedy though to assault maternity department nurses.    </p>
<p>Since a spate of newborn kidnapping some years ago maternity wards are lockdown wards, often with electronic tracking bracelets on the newborns. No one, not even the mother, can move the newborn out of the ward without permission. Nurses are disciplined or fired for breaches of the rules.<br />    <br />In January Douglas Kennedy, 10th child of Robert F. Kennedy, tried to remove his newborn child from a lockdown ward without proper clearance Kennedy later claimed he was taking the newborn outside for some fresh air (a newborn? in January? in New York?).  (See <a href="http://usnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/24/10502120-rfk-son-arrested-in-ny-hospital-maternity-unit-clash-police-say">here</a> and <a href="http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/25/a-kennedy-is-arraigned-over-a-dispute-at-a-westchester-hospital/">here</a>)  </p>
<p>A confrontation ensued and Kennedy has now been indicted for assaulting two female nurses.    <br />The most shocking part of this story? Kennedy is a reporter for a <em>Fox News</em> affiliate.<br />    <br />Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt</p>
