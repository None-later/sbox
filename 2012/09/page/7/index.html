<p>UPDATE: In comments, Art raises the valid but trivial point that this graph compares <i>nominal</i> GPDI to <i>real</i> govt investment.  Oversight on my part.</p>
<p>Here is is again, with GPDI adjusted by the implicit GDP Deflator, indexed to 100 in 2005.  This brings the GPDI line down a bit relative to government investment.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>There is a perhaps strategically overstated disagreement among enthusiasts for QE III about how it might help.  Woodford et al stress the importance of QE as a signal of precommitment to expansionary future conventional monetary policy which will act through short term interest rates when the FOMC will be inclined to raise them above the zero lower bound.  Gagnon et al stress the importance of portfolio balance effects &#8212; the shift in the supply of risky assets to the private sector which can affect prices and returns without affecting expected future monetary policy.  I stress that Woodford and Gagnon agree much more than they disagree.</p>
<p>It seems to me that QE III may provide fairly strong evidence about who is more right.  First QE III is based on purchases of fairly risky MBS not very safe Treasuries.  Those who stress portfoio balance must predict a larger effect than that of QE II (not a high bar to say the least).  In contrast the news has not had a large effect on long term bond yields which should consist of expected average future short term bond yields plus a risk premium.  In fact the 10 year bond yield was roughly the only asset price which didn&#8217;t jump dramatically on the news</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-13/yen-strengthens-asian-stocks-little-changed-before-fed-decision.html">Ten-year Treasury yields slipped three basis points to 1.73 percent after rising as much as seven points earlier. </a></p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s 0.03%.  As of 16:59:46 EST Thursday  the 5 year rate dropped by a big big 0.0481%  .  </p>
<p>If  the event study approach were valid (the full effect and no more appears as soon as the news is public and pigs fly) and if the main effect of QE III works through expected future short term rates, then nothing much should happen (and this didn&#8217;t happen <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-13/yen-strengthens-asian-stocks-little-changed-before-fed-decision.html">&#8220;The Standard &#038; Poor’s 500 Index climbed 1.6 percent to 1,459.99 at 4 p.m. in New York</a><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-13/yen-strengthens-asian-stocks-little-changed-before-fed-decision.html"> &#8220;</a>).  This paragraph is based on assuming that financial markets are efficient so it&#8217;s silly.</p>
<p>update:  it is now 6:53 EST.  According to Bloomberg.com the 5 year Treasury yield is 0.707%.  According to FRED Wednesday close was 0.7 % (seems to be rounded to the nearest basis point).  Again according to Bloomberg the yield is up 0.0692 % (I assume since Thursday close so up about 0.0211% since the announcement of QE III).  I assert again that expected future short term rates should affect the 5 year rate.  Also more certainty about future short term rates should reduce the risk premium.  I conclude that the forward guidance aspect of QEIII is miniscule and, not that it matters because it is so very very tiny, has the wrong sign.</p>

<blockquote><p>To support a stronger economic recovery and to help ensure that inflation, over time, is at the rate most consistent with its dual mandate, the Committee agreed today to increase policy accommodation by purchasing additional agency mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month. The Committee also will continue through the end of the year its program to extend the average maturity of its holdings of securities as announced in June, and it is maintaining its existing policy of reinvesting principal payments from its holdings of agency debt and agency mortgage-backed securities in agency mortgage-backed securities. These actions, which together will increase the Committee’s holdings of longer-term securities by about $85 billion each month through the end of the year, should put downward pressure on longer-term interest rates, support mortgage markets, and help to make broader financial conditions more accommodative. The Committee will closely monitor incoming information on economic and financial developments in coming months. If the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially, the Committee will continue its purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities, undertake additional asset purchases, and employ its other policy tools as appropriate until such improvement is achieved in a context of price stability. In determining the size, pace, and composition of its asset purchases, the Committee will, as always, take appropriate account of the likely efficacy and costs of such purchases.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Angrybear readers know, I consider the phrase &#8220;mortgage-backed securities&#8221; by far the most important part of the announcement.  I feared that they would compromise again and implement QE III but base it on purchases of long term Treasuries. </p>
<p>My inner weasel notes that this is still not the Gagnon proposal (as amplified beyond all political possibility by yours truly).  I would advocate the purchase of all newly issued agency MBS.  That would be on the order of $100 billion a month (if the effort was a total failure and didn&#8217;t cause higher agency issue of MBS) to maybe $200 billion and month in my wildest dreams.**  So if this doesn&#8217;t work, you can&#8217;t say I was wrong.</p>
<p>* Note the English are only up to QE II and the Scots still on QE I, so they are way behind.</p>
<p>* last night said dreams included 19 running out of gas on a mountain road, putting the car in neutral by accident and falling over a cliff to my relief as it beat blocking traffic and hearing Italian curses for hours and 2) hearing that Andrei Shleifer had taken over Harvard University in a faculty coup.  Plus a nightmare about not having enough time to pack in order to catch a plane that was really scary.</p>

<div></div>
<div>At his press conference, Romney accused Obama of “having that embassy reiterate a statement effectively apologizing for the right of free speech.” Romney claimed that the embassy had said, in his paraphrase, “We stand by our comments that suggest that there&#8217;s something wrong with the right of free speech.&#8221; This, too, was a Romney lie. The embassy had declared <a href="http://egypt.usembassy.gov/pr091112.html" target="_blank"><i>five times</i></a> in <a href="https://twitter.com/usembassycairo/status/245621390626156545" target="_blank"><i>writing</i></a> that <a href="https://twitter.com/usembassycairo/status/245635156927467520" target="_blank"><i>free speech</i></a> was a <a href="https://twitter.com/usembassycairo/status/245472954052395008" target="_blank"><i>universal right</i></a>.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>What made Romney’s statement and press conference disturbing, however, was his repeated use of the words <em>sympathize</em> and <em>apology</em> to conflate three issues the Cairo embassy had carefully separated: bigotry, free speech, and violence. The embassy had <a href="https://twitter.com/usembassycairo/status/245635156927467520" target="_blank"><i>stipulated</i></a> that expressions of bigotry, while wrong, were protected by freedom of speech and didn’t warrant retaliatory violence. Romney, by accusing the embassy of “sympathizing with those who had breached” the compound, equated moral criticism of the Mohammed movie with support for violence. In so doing, Romney embraced the illiberal Islamist mindset that led to the embassy invasion: To declare a movie offensive is to authorize its suppression.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“The Embassy of the United States issued what appeared to be an apology for American principles,” Romney asserted at the press conference. “It’s a terrible course for America to stand in apology for our values. … An apology for America&#8217;s values is never the right course.” Lest anyone miss his buzzwords, Romney called the embassy’s comments “a disgraceful statement on the part of our administration to apologize for American values.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>What, exactly, does Romney mean by “American values”? The embassy never apologized for free speech or diplomatic sovereignty. The only American offense it criticized was the movie’s “bigotry” and “efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims.” Does Romney regard this criticism as an “apology for American values”? Is bigotry an American value? Is it weak or un-American to repudiate slurs against Muslims?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don’t know where you were born, Mr. Romney (<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2012/08/romney_s_birther_joke_he_isn_t_using_bigotry_against_obama_it_just_looks_that_way_.html"><i>just kidding!</i></a>), but where I come from, there’s nothing more American than recognizing the idiocy of a man’s views and, at the same time, his right to express them. If you can’t tell the difference between those two things, the main threat to our values right now isn’t President Obama, the Egyptians, the Libyans, or our diplomats in Cairo. It’s you.
</p>

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The political punditry and news media is finally catching on that Romney’s bizarre modus operandi of habitually mischaracterizing the meanings of basic statements of others (mainly, of course, of Obama) pose the question: Is Romney a habitual liar, or is he instead so dumbfoundingly stupid that he regularly misunderstands even completely clear statements and the definitions of common English-language words, and that he habitually conflates separate concepts and therefore misinterprets even the clearest of statements or comments?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’ve hoped for a long time that the Obama campaign would pretend to take Romney at his word: Rather than suggest that Romney’s a habitual liar; just point out that, taking him at his word, he’s profoundly, dangerously stupid.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I mean … good grace.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I read somewhere last night—I can’t remember where—that members of Romney’s campaign team told reporters that he was genuinely outraged on Tuesday night by the Cairo embassy’s criticism of “efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims,” and that it was phrase “hurt the religious feelings” that really set him off.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This focus by Romney on a single word or short phrase, removed from its context and redefined—this treatment by Romney of serious issues as cutesy word play—has been a real hallmark of Romney’s campaign throughout.  Hopefully, Obama and the news media will now point out truly dangerous it would be to have a president who either can’t understand and accurately interpret basic words, statements and concepts. Leave it up to Romney to protest that, no, he’s not really that dumb; he’s just playing games about the most serious of matters, presuming that a majority of voters won’t notice. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The most important aspect of what has transpired in the last two days is that now a majority of voters are likely to notice.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m pretty sure that the game&#8217;s over, and that Romney lost.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<div>UPDATE: Just to clarify, I want to repost here a comment I made in the Comments thread in response to reader PJR about whether Romney is a liar or instead just stupid.  I wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney’s a liar, PJR. A casual, habitual liar.  That’s his modus operandi; it’s what he thinks gets him the love of the Tea Party folks—his bald willingness to regularly lie as a matter of campaign strategy.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My point, though, is to encourage Obama and the media to decide to take Romney at his word—that he’s not lying; he’s just stating things as he understands them.  Which, if so, is a HUGE problem. Even George Bush wasn’t as jaw-droppingly stupid and routinely confused about the meaning of words and statements as Romney either is or feigns. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The bottom line, I think, is that Romney is a liar and is also too stupid to recognize that eventually people were going to figure that out.
</p>
</div>

                                <p>I am just catching up with some of the news this week.  <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/09/things-more-worthy-of-remembrance-than.html">Barkley Rosser</a> at <i>Econospeak</i> had a timely post on 9/11 ceremonies and reminds us about what we accept as special or inevitably normal:</p>
<p>Things More Worthy Of Remembrance Than 9/11</p>
<p>Yes, what happened 11 years ago today was awful and tragic, and there is much that can be said about and it is worthy of remembrance.  However, it seems to me that it is being way overdone.  Osama bin Laden is dead, but we are allowing both political parties to continue to use this event to justfiy an everincreasing national security and surveillance state that is taking away our liberties. </p>
<p>Numerous other nations have had more die than we did from terrorism on 9/11, but managed to keep some perspective and treat the matter as one of policing rather than national hysteria, which was already manipulated once to get us into the utterly stupid war in Iraq.  Even though the Bush admin officially admitted that Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11, Cheney kept on claiming that he did, and 64% of those voting for Bush 8 years ago believed that he did.   </p>
<p>Here are some things more worthy of remembrance than 9/11, but which will not get even remotely as much attention:    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>1)  Monday, Sept. 17 will be the 225th anniversary of the adoption of the US constitution.<br />2) That same day will also be the 150th anniversary of the Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest day in US history, with over 23,000 dead on its battlefield, which inspired President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, which freed (most of) US slaves.  Needless to say, that is a lot more dead than on 9/11 and with a much more worthy and important outcome.    <br />Then in terms of sheer numbers of pointless dead, with us arguably being possibly able to do something about them, if not all that likely:    <br />3) Between 2000 and 2009, 298,000 Americans died of gunshot wounds.  Many of those were suicides, others were homicides, others were family accidents.  We have half the world&#8217;s guns and are far ahead of any other country on this matter (with some competition from a few with war happening on their soil).    <br />4)  During the same period, 417,000 Americans died in automobile accidents.    </p>
<p>So, let us remember 9/11, but let us keep it in perspective compared to more important things, and let us not allow it to be used for evil purposes.</p>

<p>Bartlett: <em>Mitt Romney, Carried Interest and Capital Gains</em><br />New York Times:  <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/mitt-romney-carried-interest-and-capital-gains/">Mitt Romney, Carried Interest and Capital Gains</a>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bartlett">Bruce Bartlett</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A key reason for Mr. Romney’s low tax rate is that a very substantial amount of his income comes from capital gains – 51% in 2011 and 58% in 2010. Capital gains, no matter how large, are taxed at a maximum rate of 15%, whereas wage income can be taxed as much as 35% by the income tax plus taxes for Medicare and Social Security. The latter two are not assessed on capital gains.<br />The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/opinion/more-tax-tricks-private-equity-style.html">recently commented</a> in an editorial that while the carried interest loophole is unjustified, the core problem is lower tax rates on capital gains generally. Said The Times, “As long as income from investments is taxed at a lower rate than income from work, there will be no stopping the search for ways, legal or otherwise, to pay the lower rate.”<br />The view that capital gains should be treated as ordinary income for tax purposes is one that is widely shared by liberal tax reformers. They got their wish, briefly, from 1987 to 1990 because Ronald Reagan agreed to raise the tax rate on capital gains to 28% from 20% in return for a reduction in the top rate on ordinary income to 28% from 50%, as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.<br />There are three big problems, however, with taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>First, even if that were the case, capital gains would still be treated more beneficially, because the taxes only apply to realized gains. &#8230;<br />Second, there is a problem with inflation insofar as capital gains are concerned. Many <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2143878">academic studies</a> have shown that a considerable portion of realized capital gains simply represent inflation, rather than real increases in purchasing power. &#8230;<br />Third, it is a fact of life that those with great wealth are the principal beneficiaries of the capital gains tax preference, and they exercise influence in our political system far out of proportion to their numbers. &#8230;<br />[I]t is a pipe dream to believe that eliminating the capital gains preference is the key to fixing the carried interest loophole. It can and should be addressed by treating carried interest as ordinary income, without requiring that all capital gains be taxed as ordinary income.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whistleblower gets millions: good for compliance improvement (and makes us ask again&#8211;did Romney get amnesty?)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Birkenfeld">Bradley Birkenfeld</a>, the UBS whistleblower who helped jumpstart the IRS&#8217;s enforcement of foreign bank account reporting and helped catch criminal tax evaders, ended up serving a relatively short prison term (for failure to be entirely forthcoming, in the case of one of UBS&#8217;s private banking customers) but also go a significant $104 million whistleblower award.  See David Kocieniewski, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/business/whistle-blower-awarded-104-million-by-irs.html">Whistle-Blower awarded $104 Million by I.R.S</a>., New York Times (Sept. 11, 2012); <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/9/12/whistleblower_brad_birkenfeld_rewarded_record_104m">Whistleblower Brad Birkenfeld Rewarded Record $104M for Exposing How UBS Helped Rich Evade Taxes</a>, DemocracyNow.org (video available); <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/7/31/exhaustive_study_finds_global_elite_hiding">Exhaustive Study Finds Global Elite Hiding Up to $32 Trillion in Offshore Accounts</a>, DemocracyNow.org (July 12, 2012) (video or transcript available); <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/09/whistleblowing">Birkenfeld&#8217;s bonanza</a>, The Economist (Sept. 11, 2012).</p>
<p>As Birkenfeld&#8217;s attorney put it:<br />
<blockquote>“Today is a great day for all the honest Americans out there who work their job and pay their taxes. Today is a great day for tax fairness. Today is a terrible day for big-time tax cheats.”  <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/09/whistleblowing">Birkenfeld&#8217;s bonanza</a>, The Economist (Sept. 11, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>The very public and very large whistleblower award should do two things:</p>
<p>1) encourage other insiders who are aware of egregious company or individual tax-evading behavior to blow the whistle and</p>
<p>2) discourage other insiders and companies from egregious company or individual tax evading behavior.<br />There have always been anonymous brown-envelope tips to the IRS from those who know what is going on but don&#8217;t want to participate in it and don&#8217;t want their competitors to gain a competitive advantage because they do.  But whistleblowers generally have access to inside information that can break the dam on enforcement.  That certainly was the case with Birkenfeld, whose information&#8211; about smuggling diamonds for UBS&#8217;s private banking clients and other means taken to help such clients avoid reporting their assets to the US government&#8211;was instrumental in increasing awareness about tax crimes and increasing the fear of God (or rather, the fear of the &#8220;revenuer&#8221;) in sophisticated, wealthy taxpayers who had been able to hide some of their assets and wealth relatively easily before.</p>
<p><em>By the way&#8211;we still do not know whether GOP presidential candidate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-ii.html">Mitt Romney</a> participated in the amnesty program that was introduced in the wake of the UBS exposure of banking secrecy&#8217;s connection to tax evasion by wealthy Americans.  As most Americans know by now, Romney refuses to release his tax returns for the relevant years when he might have participated in the amnesty program to avoid criminal prosecution. </em><br /><em></em><br /><a name="more"></a><em><br /></em><br /><em> Until he does release his returns back to 2003 o4 so, there will continue to be questions regarding his taxes, as the wealthiest nominee ever with offshore holdings galore and his sole business experience being a hedge fund with numerous offshore entities and blocker corporations.  Specifically, Americans will wonder how his self-proclaimed patriotism and love of nation plays out in his ordinary decisions.  His hedge fund, Bain Capital, has also made the news as a participant in a claimed conspiracy of hedge funds to deflate the prices they pay for companies they acquire.  See Lichtblau &#038; Lattman, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/business/documents-depict-equity-firms-like-bain-as-colluding.html?pagewanted=all">Equity Firms Like Bain Are Depicted as Colluding</a>, New York Times (Sept. 11, 2012).   </em><br /><em><br /></em><em>Both tax evasion and price-rigging are criminal activities, so it behooves Romney to release his returns and ancillary information so Americans can assess how he practices what he preaches in terms of love of country and rule of law.  Did he report his foreign assets as required all along?  Did he invest abroad (so that any purported &#8220;job creation&#8221; activity didn&#8217;t benefit us)?  Was he still influential in Bain during the period that it began, or carried on, price-fixing agreements with other powerful hedge funds?  Americans deserve to know.</em><br /><em><br /></em>Will this lead to better compliance in the future?  One suspects that there will always be those who enjoy the game of avoiding taxes so much that they will be willing to pay to play the tax evasion games even on the harder-to-manipulate playing field created by the crackdown on banking secrecy and offshoring of funds.  But hopefully they will be fewer, and less successful! </p>

<div>After expressing sorrow about the deaths, Mr. Romney told reporters on the campaign trail that the Obama administration had tried to appease Islamic extremists who should have been condemned instead. He said a statement issued by the American Embassy in Cairo before the deaths criticizing an anti-Islamic video was “akin to an apology” and a “severe miscalculation.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">“The first response of the United States must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation, and apology for American values is never the right course,” Mr. Romney said, speaking at a campaign stop in Jacksonville, Fla. He added, “They clearly sent mixed messages to the world.”

<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/us/politics/attacks-fuel-escalation-in-presidential-race.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;pagewanted=all">Embassy Attack Fuels Escalation in U.S. Presidential Race</a></i>, Peter Baker, New York Times, today
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>For the last few days I’d thought that all Obama had to do to wrap up this election was run ads showing clips of Romney’s <a href="http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/romney-ryan-tax-loopholes.php">bizarre interview</a>on last Sunday’s Meet the Press—e.g., “Well, the specifics [of the tax plan] are these which is those principles I described are the heart of my policy.”—maybe juxtaposed with clips of Romney’s speech to the Detroit Economic Club last February in which he identified some specifics, er, principles.  (Or is it principles, er, specifics?  Hard to tell, with such specific principles.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And I still think that an ad of that sort would do the trick.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But I also now think that a precise, appropriate response by Obama to Romney’s weird statement would effectively end Romney’s election chances.  It is, after all, hard to imagine a more dangerous statement by a president, and therefore by a presidential candidate, than the pronouncement that America’s values—America’s <i>values</i>— include wanting Americans to deliberately offend the world’s Muslims. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney apparently believes that it’s fine to risk American lives overseas (including, presumably, members of our military) by appearing to support such pointlessly offensive provocation.  Obama should point this out, even if the news media doesn’t.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Obama also shouldn’t allow the detachment of those comments by Romney, which indicate pretty starkly that Romney doesn’t understand even the concept of diplomacy, from the implications of those comments in spheres beyond foreign policy and defense.  I’ve wondered for a while now why the Obama campaign hasn’t emphasized more Romney’s persistent habit of drawing conclusions based upon erroneous fact or upon no facts at all. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The very essence of Romney’s candidacy, at least originally, was his claimed cool-headed judgment and problem-solving ability.  Yet time and again he appears unable to accurately or adequately assess basic facts and understand even the most obvious implications of those facts—and of his own statements and conduct.  What has been apparent to me for nearly a year now, and what this incident should now clarify for the general public, is that Romney is not prompted to action—whether in foreign policy, defense, the economy, or anything else—by anything other than immediate opportunism and his adopted ideology.  And that, even worse, he seems unable even to <i>understand</i> the implications of what he says, what he proposes and what he does.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don’t see how his election hopes can survive his comments of yesterday and today.

                                <p>The Wall Street Journal is running an article where they suggest that sales of the new i Phone could boost US real GDP growth. </p>
<p>http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10000872396390443696604577645920875813322.html<br />ased firm</p>
<p>But the i Phone is built in China by a Taiwanese based firm.  So the consumer and business spending on the new i Phone will be offset in the GDP accounts by imports of the i Phone, making it a wash in the GDP accounts.</p>
<p>You would think that the Wall Street Journal would know this.   I guess this is just another example of how under the new ownership the low standards of the Wall Street Journal editorial page are spreading into its  news coverage.</p>

                                <p>John Quiggin writes at  <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2012/09/10/the-white-working-class/">Crooked Timber</a> on a not new discussion on what constitutes &#8220;white working class&#8221; or &#8220;whiteworkingclass&#8221; used in media descriptions.  In comments there are several who tackle the question well&#8230;.Bruce Wilder for one.  I am not sure there is a clear answer without considering geographical issues and histories, rural/city/suburb issues, and such, but has implications for who we notice as important.</p>
<blockquote><p>All became clear(or, at least, clearer) when I discovered that US political discussion uses two very different (though correlated) concepts of “working class”. The first is the more or less standard one – people who depend on wage labor (normally in manual or low-status service occupations) for their income. The second, specific to the US, and standard in most political polling, is “people without a 4-year college degree”, a class which includes such horny-handed sons and daughters of toil as Bill Gates and Paris Hilton. More prosaically, it includes lots of small business owners, and (since college graduation rates were rising until relative recently), over-represents the old.</p>
<p>Data on US voting patterns is surprisingly scarce, but Andrew Gelman has a big data set confirming the point that <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/03/23/voting-patterns-of-americas-whites-from-the-masses-to-the-elites/">Republican voting rises with income</a>&#8230;<br />&#8230;<br />As the pie chart below illustrates, the biggest group in the Republican voting base, and the group with which they do best is that of middle/high income whites without college degrees (the percentage after the group name gives the Republican share of the vote for that group). There’s nothing surprising in this, since all three variables are correlated with Republican voting. It’s the practice of calling this group “working class” that causes the confusion.</p></blockquote>
