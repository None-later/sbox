<p>(Dan here&#8230;Dale Coberly replies to this article (<a href="http://www.economics21.org/commentary/it-becoming-too-late-fix-social-securitys-finances">Is it Becoming Too Late to Fix Social Security&#8217;s Finances?</a>) by Charles Blahous). </p>
<p>Blahous,</p>
<p>You do not seem to grasp how small &#8220;4% of the tax base&#8221; is,  or how very reasonable it would be to pay that 4% for a longer, richer retirement, out of an income that will be more than twice what it is today.</p>
<p>That might be a politically difficult concept where neither side is being honest.  The &#8220;right&#8221; want to cripple Social Security for essentially ideological reasons.  And the &#8220;left&#8221; wants &#8220;the rich&#8221; to pay for Social Security&#8230; for essentially ideological reasons.  But as you note, the essense of Social Security is that the workers pay for it themselves.</p>
<p>Moreover, that 4% can be reached over a period of nearly eighty years.  To do it without ever reaching short term actuarial insolvency would require about a one tenth of one percent increase in the tax (combined) each year starting very soon,  or a one tenth of one percent increase in the tax (for each the worker and his boss) starting in about 2018 and running through abut 2033&#8230;  or some combination.</p>
<p>Further increases of one tenth of one percent (each) would be needed at a decreasing frequency, such that by the end of the 75 year actuarial window, the rate increases would be about one tenth of one percent every ten years&#8230;  again, while wage are projected to be increasing over one full percent per year.</p>
<p>And again, this would be neither a burden nor unfair to the workers.  They would get the money back over a longer retirement, and at a higher standard of living in retirement than current workers.  Moreover they would have at least twice as much money in pocket AFTER paying the tax as they have today.</p>
<p>The problem may indeed be &#8220;political,&#8221;  because neither side is honest enough to recognize this simple solution.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I am generally skeptical about the importance of further QE in the USA, but I am definitely not skeptical about the effectiveness of the the leaked European Central Bank plan to purchase unlimited amounts of European Government debt.  The reason is that there are government bonds over here which terrify investors.  That means that the amount which private investors must hold should have a fairly large effect on the price (different European government bonds are not at all close substitutes).</p>
<p>The leaked plan is a compromise between the sane and the German (two of my best friends are German) .  Importantly the ECB will not place an upper limit on yields on bonds, that is promise to buy any amount if the price falls below some level. </p>
<p>The purchased bonds must be fairly short term bonds (the aim seems to be to make the intervention as ineffective as possible).  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-05/ecb-plan-said-to-pledge-unlimited-sterilized-bond-buying.html">Jana Randow and Jeff Black&#8217;s Bloomberg report</a> that up to three year bonds will be bought.  Again this is based on leaks.  Alarmingly Il Corriere della Sera reports both this claim and the dramatically contrasting claim (from a source identified only as &#8220;German speaking&#8221;) that the bonds will be of duration only up to 1 year.  That would be almost pointless.    I can&#8217;t get the corriere link (I read the article in the dead tree version and search ilcorriere is horrible).  The key passage is &#8220;Draghi ha citato l&#8217;esempio di titoli circolante sul mercato secondario con scadenze &#8216;fino a tre anni&#8217; secondo alcune fonti, o &#8216;al di sotto di un anno&#8217;, secondo altre che parlano Tedesco.&#8221; that is &#8220;Draghi gave an example of bonds on the secondary market with maturity &#8220;up to three years&#8221; according to some source, or &#8216;less than one year&#8221; according to other sources who speak German.&#8221;</p>
<p>In comparison QE II consisted of purchases of 7 year notes and Twist of (sterilized) purchases of 30 year bonds.  My view is that QEII was totally pointless (didn&#8217;t even statisticall significantly affect the price of 7 year bonds) and Twist was at least better than QEII.  So 3 years is not long enough.  On the other hand, Spanish, Italian, Irish, Portoguese and especially Greek (PIIGS) bonds are not at all like US Treasuries.  They are not close substitutes for money at alllll (I personally will absolutely not exchange any of my money for any such bond with maturity over 3 months).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that it is important at all that the intervention will be allegedly sterilized.  That would normally mean that the ECB sells bonds of another type when it buys PIIGS bonds so the money supply doesn&#8217;t increase.  Jana Randow and Jeff Black at Bloomberg report</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;At the moment, the ECB mops up the impact of its mothballed bond-purchase program by offering banks weekly term deposits that currently return 0.01 percent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> I assume that these deposits don&#8217;t count for reserve requirements (which I doubt are binding in noted contrast to capital requirements for some (mostly Spanish) banks).  Aside from that they are very close substitutes for money.  I consider this fake sterilization. </p>
<p>To me the big issue is the 1 year vs 3 year war of leaks.</p>

<p>As the Republicans Take Tampa, Consider What a GOP Victory Would Mean for Women’s Health</p>
<p>For decades, Republicans have opposed abortion. This, we know, and so it comes as no surprise that <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/nicole-belle/mitt-romney-calls-roe-v-wade-one-dark">Mitt Romney, the Party’s presidential candidate, has called “Roe vs. Wade“ one of the darkest moments in Supreme Court history.” <strong></strong></a></p>
<p>But what some call the “war against women” is escalating. This year, the Republican platform calls for a constitutional amendment that would make abortion illegal.</p>
<p>In 1976, the GOP blueprint acknowledged that “the question of abortion is one of the most difficult and controversial of our time,” and the Party called for “a continuance of the public dialogue on abortion,” which it called a “moral and personal issue.” Just eight years ago, the preamble to the Republican platform declared: “we respect and accept that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes differing views.” But today, there is no such language in a platform that calls for “a human life amendment to the Constitution,” and declares that “abortion is detrimental to women’s health and well-being.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Ohio all have passed legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks, even though, as the Center for American Progress’ Emillie Openchowski points out “<a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2012/08/23/33841/abortion-is-the-battle-but-womens-health-is-the-war">complications are sometimes discovered after this point in a pregnancy that could cause serious harm to the woman</a>. In those states, a woman would be forced to continue the pregnancy, no matter the risk to her health.” This is frightening.</p>
<p>While Republicans parade women across their Tampa stage– and avoid talking about what they have quietly embedded in the Party platform–it seems a good time to consider what a Republican victory would mean for women’s health.</p>

<h4><strong>Turning Back the Clock: Contraception</strong></h4>
<h4>Susan Faludi’s Pulitzer-prize winning 1991 book, <em>Backlash,</em> is subtitled: “The Undeclared War Against American Women.” Twenty-one years later, it seems the war is out in the open . As a recent <em>New York Times</em> editorial observes: “Having won on abortion, social conservatives are turning to birth control.”</h4>
<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) promises women <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/07/19/conservative-media-cover-up-support-for-contrac/187250">access to contraception without co-pays, an idea which enjoys widespread popular support–at least among women. Nationwide 80% of women voters support the idea, according to a June survey by Hart Research Associates</a>. An earlier Hart poll revealed that 77% of Catholic women and 72% Republican women approved of free birth control. By contrast, just <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">sixty percent of all men embrace the proposal</a>. Still, that’s a majority.</p>
<p>Who, then, actually <em>opposes</em> making birth control available to all women, regardless of income?<br />The extreme conservatives who now run the Republican Party have made their feelings clear. In February, House Speaker John Boehner, stood on the House floor, and promised to overturn any rule requiring employers to pay for birth control for their workers:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/domesticpolicy/as-contraception-rule-goes-into-effect-unusual-silence-from-republicans-20120801">“It must not stand and it will not stand,” delcared Boehner,</a> who believes that bosses who object to birth control should not be forced to cover contraception. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, along with Senators Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; Marco Rubio;, R-Fla.; and John Thune,quickly joined in, arguing that this provision is a threat to religious freedom.</p>
<p>The right-wingers who now control the GOP seem to view contraception as a “women’s issue” that should be decided by men. Thus, at <a href="http://www.dccc.org/pages/wherearethewomen">a House Oversight Committee hearing, House Republicans convened a panel on denying access to birth control coverage with five men– and <em>no</em> women.</a></p>
<p>As for Republican presidential candidate <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/08/26/745521/romney-touts-romneycare-im-the-guy-that-got-healthcare-for-all-the-women-and-men-in-my-state">Mitt Romney, in a <em>Fox </em>interview just last Sunday, he said: “of course women have a right to use contraception”– if they can afford it. </a></p>
<p>In March Romney told a Town Hall meeting that <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/03/20/1075916/-Romney-to-Women-You-Want-Birth-Control-Vote-for-the-Other-Guy">if “a woman wants access to free birth control” she “should vote for the other guy,” </a>adding, “there are a lot of things that we have in our society that we may like,” but that government should not be paying for.” This suggests that “the Pill” is a luxury, like a $75 blouse.<br />Romney also has endorsed the “<a href="costhttp://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/03/01/435290/romney-says-he-would-oppose-blunt-bill-if-it-prevented-people-from-getting-contraception/">Blunt amendment” that would let any employer drop health insurance coverage for contraception </a>and other health services on religious or moral grounds.</p>
<p>Here we are not just talking about Catholic colleges and hospitals. President Obama is making special provisions to accommodate their concerns. But the Republican “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/31/obama-administration-sen-dems-tout-health-benefits">Blunt amendment” would go further, to include private companies such as Hercules Industries, a Denver-based heating and air conditioning company</a>.</p>
<p>Co-owner Andy Newland objects to birth control, and in July, the company obtained an injunction from a federal court, allowing it to delay complying with the law until three months after the case is decided.<br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Cost of Contraception</strong><br /><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/08/1062855/--Anybody-can-afford-birth-control-says-clueless-Greg-Gutfield-of-Fox-News">According to Fox News’ Greg Gutfield, “Anybody can afford birth control.” </a>In July, he asked his audience, “How much more affordable can you make it? . . I mean, do we–should we start up like a ‘buy the pill’ campaign? Like ‘feed the children’ where we make sure we all adopt one woman and pay for her pills?”<br />Gutfield is, of course, wrong about the cost. In recent years, <a href="http://ww.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">birth control has become extremely expensive for low-income women</a>, even if they are insured. Co-payments for pills typically range between $15 and $50 per month, and for other contraceptive devices, such as IUDs, co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses can reach into the hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>“Since the average American woman wants to have two children,” Planned Parenthood points out, “she‘ll spend approximately five years pregnant, postpartum, or trying to have children, but 30 years trying to prevent pregnancy. <a href="http://ww.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">That can add up to thousands of dollars spent on prescription birth control.” </a><br />Little wonder that, according to a recent survey, more than one-third of American women voters have struggled with the cost of prescription birth control at some point in their lives, and, as a result, have used birth control inconsistently. Planned Parenthood reports that “this number rises dramatically among younger women, with more than half (55 percent) mentioning a time when they could not afford to use birth control consistently.”</p>
<p>Thus, “<a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">In the U.S., half of all pregnancies are unintended</a>.” Inevitably, a great many uniplanned pregnancies end in abortion. “If we are serious about reducing the unacceptably high rate of unintended pregnancies in this country, we need to get at the root cause and take practical steps to increase access to affordable birth control,” Planned Parenthood observes. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Without the Affordable Care Act– What Women Would Lose</strong><br />The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/28/platform-abortion_n_1837571.html">GOP platform states that a Republican President would use his waiver authority “on his first day in office” to halt progress in carrying out the Affordable Care Act</a>. Romney has pledged to repeal health reform during his first 100 days in the White House.</p>
<p>This means that <a href="http://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2012/04/28/health-reform-a-huge-victory-for-women/">insurers selling policies in the individual market would be able to continue charging a women at least 30 percent more than they would charge a man for exactly the same policy–</a>even if the coverage did not include maternity benefits.</p>
<p>Women also would lose free access to a list of preventive services that the ACA requires that insurers offer without co-pays, and without applying deductibles.</p>
<p>For women, the essential preventive services include: free screening for cervical and breast cancer; breastfeeding support, supplies, and counseling; well-women visits, prenatal care, screening and counseling for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV; screening for gestational diabetes; and screening and counseling for domestic partner violence.</p>
<p><strong>Planned Parenthood and Title X </strong><br />Mitt Romney has pledged that he will “get rid of” Planned Parenthood, an organization that operates nearly 800 health centers throughout the United States, offering sexual and reproductive health care for the nearly three million women and men who visit these centers each years. While helping women avoid unintended pregnancies, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/planned-parenthood-glance-5552.htm">Planned Parenthood also provides roughly 770,000 Pap tests and nearly 750,000 breast exams annually</a>, along with more than four million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections. At sometime in their lives, one in five American women have found help at Planned Parenthood.<br />During his Sunday interview on Fox, Mitt Romney reiterated his desire to defund the organization, arguing that taxpayer dollars should not fund abortion.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/04/08/157196/jon-kyl-90-percent-planned-parenthood-abortion">the truth: abortion constitutes only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services </a>and abortion is covered by private funds. Federal dollars are not used.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney’s fiscal plan also proposes eliminating Title X—the main federal family-planning program supported by President Nixon and then-Congressman George Bush Sr. at its creation in 1970. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/us/texas-womens-clinics-retreat-as-finances-are-cut.html">Title X does not pay for abortions, but it prevents abortions and unintended pregnancies by the hundreds of thousands each year</a>. It also pays for cancer screening and some abstinence counseling for teenagers.<br />In Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry already has rejected Title X money, assuring that countless poor women in his state will be denied access to all reproductive health care, from birth-control pills to Pap smears.</p>
<p><strong>Misogyny: The Elephant in the Room </strong><br />That both Bush and Nixon supported Title X serves as a reminder of how much the Republican party has changed. As <em>New York Magazine’s</em> Frank Rich points out in a marvelous piece titled “Stag Party”: <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">“For much of its history, misogyny was not the style of the party of Lincoln</a>. For most of the twentieth century, the GOP was ahead of the curve in bestowing women’s rights</p>
<p>Today, many Americans under 40 have no idea how different the GOP (not the mention the country as a whole) was 25 or 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Rich takes us back, reminding us that Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater (who in 1964 was considered ultra-conservative) was married to a woman who had been “inspired by birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger.” Thus, Peggy Goldwater “would help build one of the nation’s largest Planned Parenthood affiliates.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">Barry Goldwater favored abortion rights</a>. “‘I think the average woman feels, My God, that’s my business,’ and that’s the way we should keep it,” he said late in his career.<br />Rich goes on to reveal that “Prescott Bush, the Connecticut senator who sired a presidential dynasty, was another Sanger enthusiast and treasurer for the first national Planned Parenthood fund-raising campaign. His son, <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">George when a congressman in the sixties, was an ardent birth-control advocate and the principal Republican author of the trailblazing Family Planning Act of 1970. </a>”</p>
<p>“Capitol Hill colleagues jokingly nicknamed him ‘Rubbers.’”</p>
<p>Even Richard Nixon, that much misunderstood liberal Republican, favored the Equal Rights Amendment and in 1972 signed the Equal Employment Opportunity Act to strengthen the policing of workplace discrimination.”</p>
<p>But Nixon was nothing if not a study in anguished contradictions<a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">. “At the tail end of the Nixon presidency,” Rich notes, “the GOP started backing away from its traditional beneficence on women’s issues</a>.” In a telling shift, “Nixon vetoed a bipartisan bill enabling child care for the millions of mothers then rapidly joining the workforce.”</p>
<p>Looking back, the timing makes sense. Both Watergate and Nixon’s “enemies’ list” foreshadowed the deepening parenoia that would lead to a purge with the Republican party itself.<br />Granted, it would be two decades before the GOP’s “Big Tent” collapsed. The liberal and moderate Republicans who I had admired in the 1970s and 1980s (Nelson Rockefeller, Lowell Weicker, and Charles Mathias, to name a few) would disappear. But it was not until the 1990 that the long knives came out, and moderates began to be sliced out of the party. Some gave up and retired.</p>
<p>Why did Nixon kill the childcare bill? Rich explains: “His veto was accompanied by a jarring statement that child care would threaten American families by encouraging women to work,” <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">The inspiration for this unexpected reactionary broadside came . . . from political strategists eager to exploit the growing backlash against the sixties feminist movement.”</a></p>
<p><strong>Backlash–As Male “Influence and Power” Declines </strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>What we are seeing in the GOP today is a continuation of the pay-back that Susan Faludi described in her 1991 book, <em>Backlash</em><strong><em>.</em> </strong><br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong>Conservatives like to claim that “The War Against Women” is a metaphor manufactured by Democrats as they prepared for the 2012 election. This simply is not true. Long ago, women such as Faludi saw that herd of elephants coming our way.</p>
<p>In fact, as Rich points out, in 1996 “Tanya Melich, the daughter of a state senator in ultraconservative Utah” who grew up “to be a stalwart New York Republican and a 1992 Bush convention delegate, wrote a book titled <em>The Republican War Against Women</em>. “These days,” he writes, “her eyewitness account of her party’s transformation seems more pertinent and prescient than ever.”</p>
<p>The anger that Republicans direct toward women that can be traced to the “women’s movement” of the 1960s. Men feared that women would take their jobs. Husbands were threatened; once their wives had some financial independence, they might decide to strike out on their own. Fathers realized that the “Pill” would give their daughters sexual freedom: marriage could become a choice, not a necessity.</p>
<p>Worst of all, as women gained power, both in the workplace and in government, this could mean that men would find themselves having to answer to the likes of Elizabeth Warren. (In 2009, when Warren, who is now running to recapture Ted Kennedy’s Senate seat for the Democrats, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz7ruJw6byQ">questioned Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner about 13 billion dollars Goldman Sachs got out the back door of AIG –“Do you know where the money went?”</a> — her tough, probing questions made jaws drop– including Geithner’s. Geithner would later express opposition to her possible nomination to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.)</p>
<p>In <em>Backlash</em>, Faludi quotes Seymour Martin Lipset and Earl Raab, two political scientists who have explored the “politics of backlash”: “The reaction” is driven by “groups which are declining in a felt sense of importance, influence and power,” they explain, “Unlike classic conservatives” Faludi adds, “these ‘pseudo conservatives,’ as Theodore Adorno dubbed them…are not so much defending a prevailing order as resurrecting an outmoded or imagined one.”</p>
<p>She also quotes the historian Richard Hofstadter: “‘America has largely been taken away from them and their kind, though they are determined to try to repossess it and to prevent the final destructive act of subversion.’”</p>
<p>In other words, they are afraid, and when people are “on the run,” some turn mean.<br />Conservative white men know that the demographics are against them. Before long, they will be outnumbered, and in future years, more and more African Americans, Latinos, Asians and women of all races will be in positions of power.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: I am not talking about majority of white men. My husband, his brother, my son, his father (my ex-husband), and a great many men who I know either personally or professionally do not fit this mold.<br />But, without question, some white conservative men saw Barack Obama’s election in 2008 as a sign that the country “was being taken away from them.” To Mitch McConnell, Obama’s re-election would constitute what Hofstadter terms “the final destructive act of subversion.”</p>
<p>In a sense, those who feared the rise of feminism in the 1960s were right. The women’s movement would never be snuffed out. Instead, it became part of our culture. Today many fewer women call themselves “feminists.” The vast majority of younger women simply assume that they have a right to work, to assume positions of power in the larger world, to control what happens to their bodies. This is the legacy of the Sixties.<br />
<h4><strong>The Violence against Women Act </strong></h4>
<p>Women also take it for granted that they have a right to protection against the rage that sometimes threatens them–and their children– in their own homes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this year, House Republicans felt free to block renewal and expansion of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a 20 -year-old law that offers shelter and counseling to women who have been beaten or sexually assaulted by spouses or partners.</p>
<p>In the past, renewal was not even in question. But today, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/us/politics/senate-votes-to-renew-violence-against-women-act.html">Some conservative groups view the Violence Against Women Act as “a slush fund for feminist causes that harms men unfairly and encourages the dissolution of marriages</a>,” the <em>New York Times</em> reported .</p>
<p>Last week, I wrote about <a href="http://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2012/08/26/what-would-a-gop-victory-mean-for-womens-health/">how and why Republicans were able to block the VAWA on HealthInsurance.Org</a>. Conseratives claim that Democrats “politicized” the issue by turning it into a fight over illegal immigrants, Gays and Lesbians. I do not buy that argument. Nor did all seven Republican women in the Senate. They voted to renew the bill.</p>
<p>That post also explains why it is so important that, in November, women–and men who like women–come out to vote. The turnout, not just in the Presidential contest, but in many Congressional races, will determine who takes over Washington.</p>

                                <p>Okay, more jargon. But important jargon because the policy proposals are starting from different baselines themselves defined by this jargon. So while some of the following is basic, it is equally a rhetorical (in the classical definition) baseline.</p>
<p>Under current Social Security law future benefits are set by a formula. For a given individual this formula starts from income history but if we take total benefit payouts in the aggregate we have cost totals primarily driven by employment numbers, Real Wage, and CPI. And this aggregate number represents 99% or so of the category that the Report Tables label as &#8220;Cost&#8221;. These projected future benefits are in turn offset by projected income deriving from one main and two minor sources, that is FICA payroll tax, tax on certain benefits, and interest on Trust Fund assets, with the totals being labeled in the Tables as &#8220;Income&#8221;. In an ideal world the trend of projected Income would exceed projected Cost in just the amount needed to maintain a specific, relative level of reserves. This state of affairs for any given year or set of years is called &#8220;actuarial balance&#8221; and if projected to continue beyond the 75 year actuarial window, and with an upward trend is called &#8220;sustainable solvency&#8221;.</p>
<p>As it turns out current mid-range projections of future employment, Real Wage, CPI, payroll income, tax on benefits, and interest on Trust Fund assets do not project &#8220;sustainable solvency&#8221;, instead there is a projected gap between total income and accumulated assets available to pay out future benefits and total projected costs. That is if we simply assume ALL mid-range projections, something that is labeled in the Reports &#8220;Intermediate Cost&#8221;  and follow current law that requires payment of full &#8220;scheduled benefits&#8221; as long as total income and assets allow those benefits to be &#8220;payable&#8221;, at some point the latter level falls below the former. The state in which &#8220;scheduled benefits&#8221; exceeds &#8220;payable&#8221;  can be called &#8220;insolvency&#8221;, or working up the shrillness index &#8220;crisis&#8221; or even &#8220;bankruptcy&#8221;.</p>
<p>But before we start hyperventilating it would be useful to slow down and actually examine the financial and legal implications for actual beneficiaries at this &#8220;crisis&#8221; point. Because one thing we know for sure the end result will NOT be &#8220;no check&#8221;. Maybe not the SAME check on the SAME day, but the system won&#8217;t grind to a complete halt. To see what is likely to happen under current law and realistic political projections you will need to follow under the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />(Lucky you, a computer crash wiped out a bunch of text. So a shorter version.) The takeaway most readers of the Social Security Report would have is that at the point at which projected &#8220;Income&#8221; (which defines &#8220;payable benefit&#8221;) falls below &#8220;Cost&#8221; (which defines &#8220;scheduled benefit&#8221;) current law simply reduces the latter to the former overnight resulting in around an immediate 22-25% cut in benefit checks.</p>
<p>But this is where the two groups I will call fairly neutrally Social Security &#8220;Defenders&#8221; vs &#8220;Reformers&#8221; start talking past each other. While each sees this cut as tremendously disruptive &#8220;Defenders&#8221; see that disruption in the form of Gramma spending her remaining shopping dollars in the Catfood Aisle, while &#8220;Reformers&#8221; see armies of Greedy Geezers storming Capitol Hill in their Lexus&#8217;s demanding their God-given right to pay Country Club dues with their full scheduled Social Security check.</p>
<p>As such their definitions of &#8220;Fix&#8221; and even &#8220;Preserve&#8221; take very different forms.  I like to think of this in the logicians terms of &#8220;direction of fit&#8221;. &#8220;Defenders&#8221; want to &#8220;fix&#8221; Social Security by ensuring that &#8220;payable&#8221; is fitted to &#8220;scheduled&#8221; while reformers prefer fixes that will defuse the crisis by fitting &#8220;scheduled&#8221; to &#8220;payable&#8221;. Both sides would argue that their respective fixes avoid the dreaded &#8220;slash&#8221; in benefits in the interest of &#8220;preserving&#8221; Social Security, it is just that &#8220;Defenders&#8221; are preserving a particular projected standard of living while &#8220;Reformers&#8221; are seeking to preserve a certain political peace, in their terms an avoidance of &#8220;intergenerational warfare&#8221;.</p>
<p>And as a &#8220;Defender&#8221; I am even willing to concede that certain &#8220;Reformers&#8221; are actually sincere. Where I see a perfectly fixable case of &#8220;under funded&#8221; they see an equally fixable case of &#8220;over promised&#8221;.  Which is one of many reasons why the Social Security debate is not really one of numbers, but is really at root one of values and perceived equity. Which is not an argument for civility, just a suggestion that not all &#8220;Reformers&#8221; are liars or fools. Heartless sociopaths willing to use whatever tactics and number twisting they can to keep Greedy Geezers at bay? Sure. Fools? Well not ALL of them. And given a generous interpretation of whether &#8220;scheduled&#8221; or &#8220;payable&#8221; is the correct baseline to build your analysis even liar is too harsh. For some. Who simply consider themselves hard-headed realists.  </p>

<p> Romney and Private Equity&#8217;s Questionable Schemes for Paying Very Little Tax</p>
<p> Presumably any American who wants to be informed is aware that GOP presidential candidate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/-private-equity-magic-trick-equity-managers-gain-taxpayers-losses-reich-video.html">Mitt Romney</a>&#8216;s claim to business acumen resides in his experience at a <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/-private-equity-magic-trick-equity-managers-gain-taxpayers-losses-reich-video.html">private equity firm</a> that made much of its money by ramping up debt at purchased firms and using that debt to repay whatever (usually relatively small) investment the equity firm partners made in what has come to be known as &#8220;LBO&#8221; deals (for &#8220;leveraged buyout&#8221;).  In LBOs, the equity firm investors almost always do well to exceedingly well, using mostly other people&#8217;s money. </p>
<p>Not so generally for the workers in the bought-out company.  The &#8220;rent&#8221; profits of the equity firm are often on the back of the workers, who may get fired in favor of outsourcing their jobs or get stuck in a rut, as productivity gains go to the new managers and owners and not to the workers.  At the least, the high debt load makes it very difficult for the company to succeed and certainly difficult for it to give its workers a fair shake.   Remember that one of Romney&#8217;s gaffs was to admit that he enjoys firing workers.<br />Why anybody thinks this kind of winner-take-all, leverage-&#8217;em-up mentality of private equity firms suggests the kind of leader desirable for a democracy that purports to provide genuine opportunity for all classes of citizens to live a decent life is beyond me. </p>
<p>But even if the very nature of the business and the common tools of over-leverage and &#8220;rent&#8221; profits for a very few already at the top don&#8217;t give voters cause for pause, then there are the many ways that private equity firm partners manage to avoid paying their fair share of taxes, which ensures that more of the tax burden falls on the less-well-off, that are worthy of consideration, even if candidate Romney has not (as his campaign claims) benefited from them personally.  That is because if Romney is elected president, his views on the acceptability of aggressive tax strategies of questionable legality will matter.  We should know what kinds of tax schemes are routine in the business that he touts as good evidence of his ability to serve as president of this nation&#8211;especially if some of them are obviously poor policy (the carried interest treatment) or highly questionable tax avoidance schemes (the management fee conversion waiver scheme).</p>
<p>1. Carried Interest   (More after the jump)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The best known way private equity firm partners reduce taxes is by earning their compensation in the form of &#8220;carried interest&#8221; and claiming that such profits should be treated the same way a real capital investment in a partnership is treated, even though it is awarded as compensation for their purported management expertise and work and not as a return on an actual investment made.   That is, they claim they are profits partners in the firm and that their compensation is a distribution of the partnership&#8217;s profits (usually from gains on sales, and hence eligible for preferential capital gains) to them rather than compensation income.  As such they benefit from the extraordinarily preferential rate for capital gains in the current law as enacted under the Bush administration (generally 15%).  Carried interest is the primary reason that candidate Romney has to pay such a very low rate of taxes on his income from his business.</p>
<p>The Internal Revenue Code (the codification of the federal statutes governing the federal income tax) does not include a specific provision governing profits interests and indicating that such &#8220;profits&#8221; partners should be treated as actual partners in a partnership (without that partnership interest itself being subject to tax as compensation) entitled to receive capital gains distributions.  Accordingly, as one partnership tax treatise puts it, the tax treatment of a transfer to a &#8220;service partner&#8221; of a &#8220;profits interest&#8221; for services &#8220;has been uncertain&#8221; because &#8220;[n]o provision of the Code specifically exempts from taxation the receipt of any partnership interest in exchange for services.&#8221;  Willis &#038; Postlewaite, Partnership Taxation, 6th ed, at 4-124.    There is some case law about profits interests, but those cases made it even less clear how and when such interests should be taxed. </p>
<p>Finally, the Service resolved the issue with administrative authority (heavily lobbied for in the interests of equity partners and real estate profit partners, in particular) in Rev. Proc. 93-27 (and later proposed regs and other items) that does not treat the issuance of a compensatory &#8220;profits interest&#8221; as  a taxable event in most instances.  The main reason for the treatment may well be the so-called &#8220;Wall Street Rule&#8221;&#8211;once incredibly wealthy taxpayers hire sophisticated, high-priced lawyers to produce opinons supportive of a taxpayer-favorable interpretation and then operate as though the Code blesses a particular activity, it is hard for tax administrators to issue regulatory authority that treats that activity differently.</p>
<p>2, Management Fee Conversion Waivers<br />But there is another lesser-known aspect to the compensation that private equity fund partners earn for their services in their private equity firms&#8211;the management fee.  Most explanations describe this as  compensation paid for services that is subject to taxation at the ordinary rate (just like a secretary&#8217;s wages would be).  But that disregards a practice that exists among a significant number of equity firms (the Times article linked below says about 40% in 2009) that are willing to take aggressive positions to avoid paying taxes and can afford to pay the tax professionals to provide a way to do it&#8211;the management fee waiver conversion scheme. </p>
<p>The conversion of management fees from ordinary income to capital gains is purportedly accomplished by &#8220;waiving&#8221; the fees (not necessarily across-the-board throughout the life of the firm, but often selectively and on a quarter-by-quarter basis),  Instead of getting fees, the partner claims they are &#8220;converted&#8221; to a share of related profits &#8211;i.e., they become an additional carried interest&#8211;and hence eligible for treatment as (deferred) capital gains from the firm.  </p>
<p>Some tax professionals think this conversion waiver works.  Much of this is again the &#8220;Wall Street Rule&#8221;&#8211;the claim that lots do it, the IRS has known about it, and oh it should be justifiable because now the &#8220;fee&#8221; is (sort of, maybe, kinda) at risk.  It is not really at risk in the way we ordinarily think of investment risk, since these are pre-tax dollars &#8212; the managers are not putting after-tax dollars at risk like any other investor is doing.  And as Vic Fleischer commented to the Gothamist blog, &#8220;there is a tension between economic risk and tax risk &#8230;. The way Bain set it up there&#8217;s not much risk at all, so it&#8217;s hard to see how this income should receive capital gains treatment.&#8221;  Christopher Robbins, <a href="http://gothamist.com/2012/09/02/ny_ag_bain_capital_others_may_have.php">NY AG: Bain Capital and others may have skirted tax law</a>, the Gothamist (Sept. 2, 2012).  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d guess  that most professionals do not think the conversion scheme works, at least not in most instances.  This would be especially true for those who consider that interpretations of the law should further coherent bodies of law that work as fairly as possible.  And even more tax professionals likely think that the partnership rules should be adjusted to ensure that it doesn&#8217;t work, since otherwise we are perpetuating inequities in the tax system that favor the already incredibly rich.</p>
<p>The conversion waiver issue has come to the attention of the public now because the New York State attorney general is investigating private equity firms who may have engaged in this conversion waiver practice.  See Nichnolas Confessore et al, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/business/inquiry-on-tax-strategy-adds-to-scrutiny-of-finance-firms.html">Inquiry on Tax Strategy Adds to Scrutiny of Finance Firms</a>, New York Times (Sept. 1, 2012) (noting that the AG&#8217;s subpoenas, issued by the AG&#8217;s Taxpayer Protection Bureau, cover firms like Kohlberg Kravis, TPG Capital, Apollo Global, Silver Lake and Bain, and that Bain partners may have saved more than $200 million in federal income taxes, $20 million in Medicare taxes). <br />It&#8217;s not clear on what grounds the New York AG is investigating this issue, which appears on the surface to be primarily a federal income tax issue.  It could be some sort of state-law fraud claim but it could also be a claim that underpayment of state taxes routinely results from the filing posture taken,  Equity partners in firms using the conversion waiver would presumably be able to save on state income taxes through either rate preferences and/or deferral, depending on the state and how much the state&#8217;s laws build on the federal filing.  Though New York State does not have a preferential rate for capital gains, if the timing of reporting the income is set by the conversion waiver, the deferral would amount to a significant state tax savings that deprives New York of needed revenues. </p>
<p>[<em>Aside:  By the way, some of the information about the management fee conversion waiver first came to broad public attention in connection with Bain and the trove of documents released at Gawker.com.  See John Cook, <a href="http://gawker.com/5936394">The Bain Files: Inside Mitt Romney&#8217;s Tax-Dodging Cayman Schemes</a>, Gawker.com (Aug. 23, 2012) (noting that the huge cache of Bain financial documents &#8220;shed a great deal of light on those finances, and on the tax-dodging tricks available to the hyper-rich that [Romney] has used to keep his effective tax rate at roughly 13% over the last decade&#8221;).   These documents, and the further analysis articles available at the Gawker.com site, are worth considering for their own revelation of what Romney&#8217;s real business is like and how that does (or doesn&#8217;t) suggest he can help our economy as president&#8211;it is a business where &#8220;opaque complexity&#8221; allows the &#8220;preposterously wealthy&#8221; to engage in &#8220;exotic tax-avoidance schemes&#8221;, according to the Gawker.com article.  (I have not yet personally perused much of the 950 page trove on Gawker.)  That said, Romney&#8217;s campaign issued a statement indicating that the candidate has not benefited from the conversion waiver practice.  We have not, of course, seen enough of Romney&#8217;s tax returns and supporting information to be able to judge this matter independently.  The focus on the conversion waiver thus provides yet another reason why candidate Romney should release 10 years of tax returns as other candidates have done</em>.]</p>
<p>There are two additional readable pieces on this conversion waiver issue, plus a scholarly article that anyone wanting to better understand the details can peruse.  Vic Fleischer, a tax prof at Colorado who made his original contribution to academe by writing about carried interest, has an article that sets out the issues well, with an example contrasting the significant difference in after-tax results for a real investor compared to a profits-interest purported investor.  See Victor Fleischer,<a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/whats-at-issue-in-the-private-equity-tax-inquiry/?nl=business&#038;emc=edit_dlbkpm_20120904">What&#8217;s at issue in the private equity tax inquiry</a>, DealBook, New York Times (Sept. 4, 2012). See also Brian Beutler, <a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/did-bain-capital-execs-break-the-law-using-a-common-tax-avoidance-strategy.php">Did Bain Capital Execs Break the Law Using a Common Tax Avoidance Strategy? </a>Talkingpointsmemo.com (Sept. 3, 2012). The academic piece is Gregg Polsky, <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1295443">Private Equity Management Fee Conversions </a>(Nov. 4, 2008).  The following two paragraphs are from the conclusion to that piece.</p>
<p>In fact, there are strong arguments that it is not. While managers argue that the safe harbor in Rev. Proc. 93-27 applies to the additional carried interest, there are both technical and conceptual claims to the contrary. Without the protection afforded by Rev. Proc. 93-27, the additional carried interest would be taxable upon receipt if it has a market value capable of determination. Both the context in which the additional carried interest is issued and the specific design features of the typical additional carried interest support the view that additional carried interests are significantly easier to value than prototypical profits interests.Under existing case law, this would mean that the additional carried interest is taxable upon receipt as ordinary income to the extent of its fair market value.</p>
<p>The IRS also has strong arguments under section 707(a)(2)(A), which recasts transactions that are artificially designed as partnership transactions in order to obtain tax benefits, such as character conversion. In the context of fee conversions, the most critical fact that favors section 707(a)(2)(A) re-characterization is the manager’s very limited exposure to risk. As a result, section 707(a)(2)(A) likely applies to fee conversions. If so, the manager’s attempt to convert the character of their management fee income would be thwarted.<br />

<p>Payroll Employment by Presidential Administrations</p>
<p>Ryan is saying that Obama&#8217;s record is like Jimmy Carter&#8217;s record.</p>
<p>When it comes to employment we should hope so.</p>
<p>During Carter&#8217;s four years in office payroll employment expanded some 10 million,<br />or 12.5%.  or at an average annual rate of 3.1%   This is the second best employment record of<br />any post WW II Presidential administration.  It is almost a full percentage point stronger than<br />Reagan&#8217;s average gain of 2.2%.</p>

<p>I would think the better comparison would be against Bush  where over eight years payroll employment only expanded some 308,000.   Interestingly, in three and a half years under Obama payroll employment  has expanded more that it did over eight years under Bush.</p>

<p>You would think that someone in the press would call the Republicans on their claims.</p>
<p>In modern times every Democratic presidential administration left office with a lower unemployment rate than when they took office.  But only one Republican Administration has managed this accomplishment.</p>

                                <p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a></p>
<p>Policy transmission mechanism: Broken in Italy, better in Spain<br />Yesterday, <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/60ae47cc-f5e5-11e1-a6c2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz25VANEnVy">the Financial Times </a>reported that borrowing costs for small businesses in the periphery were rising relative to the core using the ECB’s release of July MFI interest rate data. <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2012/08/01/evidence-on-clogged-transmission-channel-of-monetary-policy-in-the-euro-area/">I highlighted this point exactly on August 1</a> following Draghi’s now famous London speech, where he cautioned that monetary transmission mechanism is ‘hampered’.</p>
<p>As opposed to the FT, though, I would argue that the transmission mechanism is at least not getting worse in Spain and Portugal, and worsening in Italy. Italy is the only periphery economy (where data is made available) where the corporate borrowing costs are higher since the peak of corporate lending rates in the Euro area in July 2011.</p>
<p>The FT is wrong. It takes Spain as the case study and uses the incorrect corporate lending rate information. Specifically, <a href="http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/60ae47cc-f5e5-11e1-a6c2-00144feabdc0.html#axzz25VANEnVy">according to the FT</a> (bolded by RW):<br />
<blockquote><em>The interest rate charged by banks on a<strong> corporate loan of up to €1m lasting between one and five years – which would typically be taken out by a small business</strong> – was 6.5 per cent in July in Spain, according to the ECB figures.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>True, the rate on new business loans up to and including €1 mn with maturity of 1-5 years did see an average <a href="http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_KEY=124.MIR.M.ES.B.A2A.I.R.0.2240.EUR.N">borrowing rate of 6.5%</a> in July. However, corporate loans up to and including €1 mn with maturity of greater than 5 years saw a <a href="http://sdw.ecb.europa.eu/quickview.do?SERIES_KEY=124.MIR.M.ES.B.A2A.J.R.0.2240.EUR.N">drop in borrowing costs of 1.4% in July to 5.17%</a> . The 5.17% rate is the rate that should be quoted, rather than the 6.5% rate.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The 2012 Euro area stock of outstanding debt shows clearly that 57% of corporate loans had been made with maturity of greater than 5 years – the ECB provides no breakdown of loan data by maturity at the country level, so the FT must have been referring to the ECB’s Euro area data as the ‘typical loan’.<br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/stock_loans.jpg"><img alt="" height="291" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/stock_loans.jpg" width="483"></a><br />As demonstrated in the chart below, the story is much more complicated than the FT curtly portrays – it’s not just ‘Spain’ versus ‘Germany’. French corporate borrowing costs barely budged since July 2011. Furthermore, the corporate borrowing rates in Spain are improving rather materially compared to those in Italy and Portugal.<br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/nfc_rate_bar.jpg"><img alt="" height="379" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/nfc_rate_bar.jpg" width="476"></a><br />Italian corporate borrowing are up 0.67% since the peak of EA corporate lending rates in July 2011 (the <a href="http://www.ecb.int/stats/monetary/rates/html/index.en.html">ECB hiked its policy rate on July 13</a>). Spanish corporates, on the other hand, saw corporate borrowing costs fall the most of all the periphery economies, -1.35% since July 2011.<br />As demonstrated in the illustration below, the core is benefiting largely from ECB rate cuts compared to the periphery (chart 1 below). However, on a 3-month moving average (the rates moves are pretty choppy in Spain), the transmission mechanism in Spain is improving relative to that Italy and Portugal (chart 2 below). Using the correct data, the FT should have included this information in their article.<br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/time_series_1.jpg"><img alt="" height="338" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/time_series_1.jpg" width="507"></a><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/time_series_2.jpg"><img alt="" height="338" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/09/time_series_2.jpg" width="507"></a><br /><em><strong>Rebecca Wilder</strong></em><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2012/09/04/policy-transmission-mechanism-broken-in-italy-better-in-spain">The Wilder View&#8230;Economonitors</a></p>

<p> The Matrix: The Intersection of War, Economic Theory, and the Economy</p>
<p> Vincent Portillo and I are working on a new book, The Matrix: The Intersection of War, Economic Theory, and the Economy.  So far it is still remains an exploration rather than a finished research project.  We intend to post our progress from time to time, hoping to initiate some comments and conversation.</p>

<div><span lang="EN">Krugman and the league of reality based economists like to stress points 1 and 2, but point 3 is just as solid.  No possible forward guidance can get the 5 year rate under 0.

<div><span lang="EN">The Krugman/Woodford/Eggertsson/(apologies to those I missed) point always was that even if the monetary authority can&#8217;t get the safe short term rate lower, it *might* be able to influence the safe short term rate expected to hold a few years in the future.   But how much lower can that expected rate go?  The 5 year rate was 0.66% the last time I checked.  It is hard to imagine that Bernanke can make credible promises about policy after the end of his current term.  A negative real federal funds rate is very very far from normal (I&#8217;d say normal is about 2 % real). There is every sign that the Fed has given about all the forward guidance to bond traders that can be given.

<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">OK my thoughts on Woodfords thoughts and empirical work on forward guidance.  First I will refer to figures but not cut and paste them (not respect for copyright but laziness). Please click the links.  My only real point is that all of the shifts in interest rates are tiny.  The largest is on the order of 0.15%.  Even if interpreted as a shift in predicted short rates due to a shift in beliefs about the monetary authorities future policy, this just can’t be a big deal.  The results are consistent with important additional benefits from a 15 or maybe a 10 year commitment to extremely low interest rates.  But the current monetary authorities just can’t do that, because they probably won’t be in office.

<div><span lang="EN">But the part which really bothers me is the discussion of empirical evidence of effects of forward policy guidance.  Section 1.2.1 “Does Central Bank Speech Matter” (which really should be titled “does central Bank Speech other than explicit forward guidance matter”) concludes
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i><span lang="EN">“one cannot say that these results provide clear
</p>
<p></i><i>evidence of an ability to change beliefs about the reaction function.”</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">The next section on explicit forward guidance includes the disclaimer
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i><span lang="EN">“It is therefore of interest to consider what has happened on these occasions, even if one cannot do formal hypothesis tests with such a small sample of events, each rather unique.”</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">I’m not sure I agree.  The number of data points is equal to the number of transactions in financial markets.  Figure 1 seems to show statistically significant evidence of a drop of expected future overnight interest rates of about 10 to 15 whole basis points.  Wow.  This could be expected to have uh not much effect on anything anyone cares about because 15 basis points sure aint a lot. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN"> Woodford is a very smart guy but when he writes </div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<blockquote><p><i><span lang="EN">“It is useful to note not only that OIS rates for maturities as long as six to twelve months fall, but that the longer maturities fall more; that is, not only does the OIS yield curve fall in response to the announcement, but it flattens.”</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">He uses <span lang="EN">bold face type<span lang="EN"> to discuss a difference of 2 or 3 basis points.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">But wait, there’s more.  The 10-15 percent decline at the time of the announcement on April 21 2009 didn’t last
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">“One also observes from Figure 2 that, during the first week of June the forward rate shot up again, to a level greater than 50 basis points (and higher than in the period before the “conditional commitment”).
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">This is evidence presented by someone who concludes that forward guidance is important – that an extraordinary (perhaps unprecedented) announcement managed to get 12 month rates to decline by up to 15 basis points for about 40 days and 40 nights. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Woodford goes on to discuss Fed announcements.   First he notes a decrease of about 10 basis points again. Then he stresses in Figure 4 a decline of around 5 basis points (cheating on the timing one can get it up to around 10 basis points).  Figure 4 has a scale from 5 to 25 basis points.  The legend  includes the note that instead of the 5 year rate, the graph shows the 5 year rate minus 50 basis points.  I can’t make decent figures to save my life, but that’s unusual.  Almost substantively it may be Kosher but is not Kosher for passover to make a tiny change look large by graphing comparable variables on different scales.  Also really Five (<span lang="EN">5<span lang="EN">) basis points. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Woodford also discusses evidence other than event studies and then writes </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i>while market movements during a very short time window around an announcement can reasonably be attributed to news contained in the announcement, developments since 2010 of the kind shown in Figures 5 through 8 might alternatively be attributed simply to market participants’ increasing doubts that conditions would warrant an increase in the funds rate target anytime soon, for reasons unrelated to the FOMC’s statements.</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">In other words nothing much to see in figures 5 through 8.  He does however note that the median blue chip forecaster made a forecast of the duration of extremely low federal funds rate which corresponded to the FOMCs prediction.  That evidence in figure 5 tends to suggest (just using the median as the only summary statistic) very little room for a larger effect on forecasts of policy based on a (cross my heart and hope to die and if I break my word all shall know that I am no gentleman and should feel free to spit on me) promise not a hedged conditional prediction.  The evidence presented in figure 5 has no effect whatsoever on Woodford’s concluding section in which he discusses how the Fed could give more effective forward guidance.  There is so far in the paper at most a few basis points of evidence that Canadian or US forward guidance could possibly be more convincing.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Oh noooo it seems I am disagreeing with Lars Svensson too
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i>In a review of Sweden’s experience, Deputy Governor Lars Svensson (2010) argues that, through December 2008, the Riksbank had been relatively successful at “managing expectations” through its policy.</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">So what about evidence ? Case 1
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i>The result is that an announcement that was intended to shift down the anticipated
</p>
<p></i><i>forward path of rates, by announcing that a low rate would be maintained until</i><i>the beginning of 2011, and so to immediately lower longer-term interest rates, had</i><i>exactly the opposite effect: long rates rose, because the entire anticipated forward path of rates shifted up. </i><i>What went wrong? </i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Figure 10 shows a shift in the wrong direction of roughly a big big 15 basis points.  The average shift in the event studies is no longer around 0.1% but rather more like 0.05%
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Next
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>Svensson (2010) argues instead that survey data on traders’ forecasts of inflation and growth indicate that they were no more optimistic than the Riksbank, and hence that market participants simply did not accept the Riksbank’s forecasts about <i>its own future approach to policy.</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">So now I feel less bad about disagreeing with Svensson too, since Svensson too disputes the claim made by Svensson.  Also Woodford seems to dispute Svensson’s claim
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>If so, it would seem that the attempt to use forward guidance more aggressively after April 2009 has been associated with a loss of market confidence in the informativeness of the Riksbank’s projections. Whether it will return once macroeconomic conditions have normalized remains to be seen.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">But in any case all of the interest rate shifts discussed in the empirical section are so tiny as to matter little. So three out of four have the desired sign.  Wow. 
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">And this in a speech on the importance of forward guidance !  What could a skeptic add ?</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">OK the standard 2 disclaimers.  Woodford also discusses the direct effect of purchases of risky assets on the risk that private investors feel they are bearing so on asset prices and so on the economy.  He advocates the purchase of more MBS.  I absolutely agree with that.</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Also, of course, it is better to light one small candle that curse against the darkness.  If indeed more vigorous efforts to influenc forecasts of future monetary policy will have only a small positive effect, then they definitely should be made.  </div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">A very strange aspect of the discussion is that people who are sure that it would be easy for monetary authorities to get economies back to full employment quickly are de facto allies of people who expect the effects of shifts in monetary policy to be small but of the right sign.  Both agree on what is to be done, so almost no one stresses the huge scientific disagreements.</div>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>
<div>I like <a href="http://truth-out.org/">Truthout</a>.  I’m on its email list and so I receive daily notices about newly posted articles on the site.  I don’t read them all, but the ones I read usually are worth the time.  And I was deeply flattered when, two years ago, on the basis of two lengthy articles I posted here on AB on complicated legal issues, I was invited to blog for them, mainly on legal issues, through a new forum they were at the time planning for a small set of invited bloggers. (The forum never got off the ground, much to my disappointment.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So I suppose that this is, in a sense, a family quarrel.  But earlier today Dan emailed me with a link to a Truthout article and asked my opinion of it, and I obliged.  And hours after I first read the article, I’m still seething enough to repost those comments here.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The article is titled <a href="http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/11264-john-cusack-and-jonathan-turley-on-obamas-constitution"><i>John Cusack Interviews Law Professor Jonathan Turley About Obama Administration’s War On the Constitution</i></a>.  Turley is the Someone and Someone Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington Law School. Good for him.  He’s also the Director of the Environmental Law Advocacy Center there.  And the Executive Director of the Project for Older Prisoners.  <i>Very</i>good for him.  And he’s one of those omnipresent law-prof. presences whose byline is everywhere, or seems to be, and whose quotes also regularly appear in articles under other people’s bylines because, I think, his contact information comes already printed on the Rolodexes of legal-issues journalists when purchased.  This is especially so in recent years, because, as <a href="http://www.law.gwu.edu/Faculty/profile.aspx?id=1738">his GW faculty page</a> says, “[h]e has served as a consultant on homeland security and constitutional issues, and is a frequent witness before the House and Senate on constitutional and statutory issues as well as tort reform legislation.”  <i>Very, very</i> good for him.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It also says, “He also is a nationally recognized legal commentator; he ranked 38th in the top 100 most cited ‘public intellectuals’ in a recent study by Judge Richard Posner and was found to be the second most cited law professor in the country.”  I know. That’s my point.  He’s eminent.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>John Cusack, the article’s actual author and Turley’s interviewer, is, well, a movie star.  Star, being the operative word here.  As it is with Turley himself.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The point of the interview was to elicit Turley’s assertion that it is the obligation of principled liberals to not vote for Obama this time, because of Obama’s stances and actions on Patriot Act and other War on Terror questions and in Afghanistan. Which Cusack did, bracketed and interspersed between Cusack’s own musings on the subject.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hyperventilating after reading the article, I responded to Dan (OK, slightly edited here):
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Wow. I don’t even know where to begin.  I too have been baffled and stunned by the Obama administration’s positions on Patriot Act-related and other War on Terror prisoner civil rights issues. And on some lower-profile civil liberties issues unrelated to war or to Patriot Act matters, too—particularly certain positions as <i>amicus</i> at the Supreme Court, from time to time; cases in which the federal government is not actually a party but in which the Court has asked the Solicitor General’s office to way in anyway, or in which the administration has decided on its own to way in.  And on Afghanistan, well, the situation speaks for itself.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But only liberals like John Cusack and Jonathan Turley—people who can, literally, afford the luxury of putting “principle” above the realities of the effect of Romney/Ryan vs. Obama on so many, many, many <i>other</i> critically important public-policy and legal issues—are anything but <i>insane</i> to engage in the absurd conceit that they are principled in helping elect Romney/Ryan.  Anyone else who takes that &#8220;principled&#8221; stance is crazy.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I know all too well the specifics of the profound harm done by the Federalist Society judges—at <i>all three</i> levels of the federal bench, not just the Supreme Court.  And the courts are only one of so many parts of this.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is, truly, almost <i>nothing</i> that makes me angrier than reading this kind of garbage from people who themselves will never actually be directly impacted by the outcome of this election.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Japan’s kamikaze pilots during WWII were principled, too—or at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_T%C5%8Dj%C5%8D">their prime minister</a> and military commanders were. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>To people of that ilk, I say: Drop dead.  Or vote for Ralph Nader.  And then drop dead.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Romney campaign should have put Cusack on that stage last Thursday instead of Clint Eastwood.
