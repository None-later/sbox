<div>[A]n unusually high foreign tax credit in 2008 raises questions about the size and source of Mr. Romney’s foreign income that year and how it was treated for tax purposes. </div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/25/business/in-romneys-tax-return-clues-in-foreign-taxes.html?pagewanted=all&#038;gwh=2EA44D8EF70AEE179F919EB469FBAC40">Tax Credits Shed Light on Romney</a></i>,* James B. Stewart, New York Times, Aug, 24</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don’t follow finance-industry news very closely, and the only technical knowledge I have about U.S. tax law for foreign income is what I’ve read in the last few months concerning the foreign bank accounts that Romney’s 2010 income tax return shows he had in 2009.  Including his UBS account, which was opened in (if I recall correctly) 2003 and had $3 million in it at the end of 2009.  That account was managed by a trustee, a Boston lawyer and close friend of the Romney’s, who apparently closed the account in 2010; the account doesn’t appear in Romney’s 2011 tax-return estimate. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So it is only because of the controversy surrounding Romney’s tax returns and offshore bank accounts that I even know about the 2009 IRS amnesty program for Americans who evaded U.S. income taxes by hiding income in foreign bank accounts, and that why the program was initiated: UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank had been forced to identify thousands of U.S. citizens who had accounts there, many of whom, the IRS presumed accurately, had used the bank to evade payment of U.S. taxes.  The large number of identified evaders would make it difficult to prosecute them all; thus the temporary amnesty program.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’d wondered how this all had come about so suddenly, but hadn’t bothered to research it.  But I learned <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/jailed-banker-helped-crack-swiss-142921849.html">the answer today</a>.  An American-born UBS banker named Bradley Birkenfeld decided in 2007 to try to cash in on a newly-enacted whistleblower statute that would garner him 30% of the taxes that the IRS recouped as a result of the information he provided.  He hoped also to trade his information for immunity from criminal prosecution.  Only the monetary goal succeeded.  He was released last month from prison after serving a more-than-three-year sentence. And he was just awarded $104 million under that whistleblower statute.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>According to Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Birkenfeld">Birkenfeld</a>, who was among UBS employees whose job it was, beginning in 2001, to solicit American customers to use the bank to evade U.S. taxes, pled guilty in June 2008 to a single count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, but he was not sentenced until August 2009.  He spent the intervening 14 months earning the $104 million that he will now be paid, most of it the result of the amnesty program, which reportedly was <i>very</i>successful.  “In February 2009, UBS paid $780 million to resolve a criminal tax avoidance investigation. It also admitted to assisting 17,000 clients evade their taxes through the use of offshore accounts between 2000 and 2007,” Wikipedia says.  “In July 2009, to avoid additional fines, UBS agreed to provide the names of 5,000 Americans who had offshore accounts with UBS.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The New York Times article from which I quote above was published on the Saturday before the start of the Republican convention and best as I can tell received little attention.  So let me give it some.  All with the caveat that I probably don’t know what I’m talking about when I conclude that the information in the article seems to suggest, if I understand it correctly, that in 2008, when the U.S. and European economies were collapsing, Romney suddenly paid a seemingly inexplicable $800,000 in foreign income taxes, “far more than any other year,” as indicated in the 2010 tax returns.  Stewart writes that Romney “reported <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/25/business/25stewart-doc.html#document/p1/a69311" title="Related line from Form 1040 of Romney tax return.">more than $800,000 in taxable refunds</a> from 2009, which seems very high.” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stewart wondered how Romney’s blind trust could have earned such amounts in foreign countries and generated such large tax credits,” and so he consulted to experts,  <a href="https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/profile.cfm?section=bio&#038;personID=20283" title="Professor’s biography on N.Y.U. Web site.">Daniel Shaviro</a>, professor of taxation at New York University School of Law, and <a href="http://web.law.umich.edu/_facultybiopage/facultybiopagenew.asp?id=337" title="Professor’s biography on university Web site.">James R. Hines Jr.</a>, a professor of international taxation at the University of Michigan Law School. “One possibility,” Stewart says, “is that the financial crisis and resulting bleak economic outlook caused Mr. Romney’s trustee to cash in long-held, appreciated foreign assets. Another possibility is that they resulted from some kind of more elaborate tax shelter, or some combination of the two.”  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Might one other possibility be that Romney suddenly paid several years’ back taxes to foreign governments in 2008 or 2009?  After all, although people like me were unaware of the Birkenfeld matter, people like Romney and like the trustee of the Swiss account of course were.  (Is Romney trying to protect the reputation of his friend, the trustee?)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The large foreign tax credit for 2009, Shaviro told Stewart, “has baffled tax experts.”  It “makes no sense to me at all’.” But, Shaviro said, the IRS has challenged many tax-shelter “deals intended to generate foreign tax credits.”  And Hines said, “Lots of people are speculating about the source of this tax credit, but at this point it’s just conjecture.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Conjecture, yes.  And I’m not even an expert.  But conjecture about this sure is fun.

<p>Romer&#8217;s deficit reduction suggestions worth a read</p>
<p>Christina Romer&#8217;s recent piece in the New York Times is worth reading.  See C.D. Romer, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/09/business/cutting-the-deficit-compassionately-economic-view.html">Cutting the Deficit, with Compassion</a>, New York Times at BU5 (Sept. 9, 2012).</p>
<p>Now, I generally have found Romer too willing to advocate austerity economics and too unwilling to support progressive tax policies.  But nonetheless, this piece hits some good notes.  For example, while arguing that reducing the deficit needs to be a priority, she acknowledges that it must be done &#8220;in a way that does as little harm as possible to people, jobs and economic opportunity.&#8221;  Similarly, she recognizes that requires going slowly&#8211;&#8221; a comprehensive, aggressive deficit reduction plan [should be passed] as soon as possible, but the actual spending cuts and tax increases should be phased in as the economy recovers.&#8221;  Why?  Because &#8220;[a] crude rule of thumb is that every $100 billion of deficit reduction will cost close to a million jobs in the near term.&#8221;  A big price to pay that makes it reasonable to consider not only LONG-TERM deficit reduction plans but also SHORT-TERM job creation measures.</p>
<p>(Linda here<em>&#8230;  And in case you wonder, tax cuts for the wealthiest amongst us, as advocated by the Romney-Ryan team&#8211;are NOT job creation measures.  The Romney-Ryan budget proposes to achieve revenue neutrality, huge tax cuts for the rich, and no tax cuts for the middle class by not proposing any specifics.  The reality is that the Romney-Ryan plan is just politico-wishspeaking:  there is no plan that will do what they claim, because they depend on the now-well-disproven idea that huge tax cuts for the wealthy will generate more tax revenues while creating more jobs.  Nope.  Neither likely nor even possible.  And by not specifying what they&#8217;d cut, they are merely trying to fool the people.)</em><br /><em><br /></em> Here are what Romer proposes in italics, with some commentary after:</p>
<p>1) <i>tax credits for businesses that actually increase employment</i></p>
<p>Not a bad idea to replace the endless suggestions of business tax cuts, but any accountability will have to be long-term&#8211;i.e., payroll will have to increase over a period of 2 years and the particular jobs created will have to stay in place for at least 2 years before any tax reward should be available</p>
<p>2) <i>&#8220;well-designed tax reform that raises at least some additional revenue&#8221; and &#8220;let[s] the <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/senate-votes-at-4-today-725-on-obama-tax-cut-proposal.html">Bush tax cuts</a> expire for those earning more than $250,000 a year [while] [i]ncreasing rates on top earners&#8221; and &#8220;lowering tax expenditures&#8221; including &#8220;the low tax rate on capital gains and dividends&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Hmmmm.The clarion call for tax reform has consistently been used by DC lobbyists to push for <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/senate-votes-at-4-today-725-on-obama-tax-cut-proposal.html">tax CUTS</a> for the wealthy and big business.  It is not so clear that we need a huge tax reform.  What is usually meant by tax reform is &#8220;simplification,&#8221; which is just another way to justify unneeded tax cuts  .We do not need to cut the corporate tax rate.  We do not need to reduce tax regulations. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But I do agree with Romer&#8217;s notion that we need some tax increases.  My preference would be to allow the entire panoply of Bush tax cuts&#8211;passed by a Congress that unfortunately and wrongly believed the Laffer lie that cutting taxes would increase revenues&#8211;to expire as the Republicans originally purported to intend.  Let the sunset happen.  And then come next year, think about what, if any, of the cuts make sense. Perhaps a cut to the income tax rates of those who make less than $100,000 a year.  But an increase for those that make more than that, and a significant increase for the top two quintiles, would be in order.  We should raise rates on the wealthiest by creating additional tax brackets for those making 500,000 to a million, 1-2 million, 2-10 million, and above 10 million.   We could reasonably examine the many tax expenditures/subsidies in the Code and begin to cut back on them&#8211;starting with the capital gains rate preference, and moving through the exorbitant support for wealthy mortgages (limit it to an interest deduction on the first $250,000 of mortgage interest and phase that out for anyone with an income above $500,000) and including the R&#038;D credit (rather than deduction), the &#8220;active financing exception&#8221; and the subsidy for moving active businesses offshore (and along with that, eliminating any idea that there is such a thing as a &#8220;profits&#8221; partner who isn&#8217;t taxed on a &#8220;transfer&#8221; of a partnership interest at the time the interest is provided).</p>
<p>3)<i> slowing spending growth for government health care spending- by reducing overpayments to health care providers (as the $716 billion cut misrepresented by the GOP does); by increasing those cost-cutting reforms to find other ways that we are inefficient; by &#8220;making the wealthy pay a larger share of their Medicare costs and gradually raising the Medicare eligibility age&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Here we see the problem that no one in government dares to say what must be said&#8211;that until we move to a single-payer system like the rest of the advanced world, we will see private parties continuing to rip off rent profits from providing health care.  We must eventually expand to &#8220;medicare for all&#8221;&#8211;and we should do that soon.  In the transition, it would be reasonable to have a means-adjusted payment scale, so that the Medicare tax is higher for those with more income (corresponding to the increased brackets for the income tax).  And it might be reasonable to have a few major categories of jobs for determining base retirement age&#8211;workers in steel plants who work in 115 degree interiors when it is 90+ degrees outside likely should retire earlier than workers in academia who work at their desks in air-conditioned offices.  But that won&#8217;t be easy and will need to be developed by consensus over some reasonable time, rather than through partisan, anti-worker politics.</p>
<p>4) <i>cut other spending&#8211;protecting children, displaced workers, and wounded veterans in the process,as well as money for education (including <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell_Grant">Pell grants</a>) and infrastructure and scientific research&#8211;but cutting &#8220;agricultural price supports and subsidized crop insurance programs that mainly benefit large commercial farmers,&#8221; the Pentagon&#8217;s budget, and high-speed rail.</i><br /><i><br /></i> We certainly can cut a lot of waste and warmongering out of the Pentagon&#8217;s budget, which is one reason that I&#8217;m all for letting the sequester approved by Republicans go through.  We could save a great deal there that could be used for infrastructure and other spending that builds opportunities and jobs instead of supporting the military-industrial complex.  I&#8217;d also support  cutting most of the agricultural subsidies, which primarily support Agribusiness that produces tasteless food at a high environmental cost.  But I disagree strongly on high-speed rail.  If we don&#8217;t as a nation invest in transportation infrastructure that moves us beyond the costly highways (costly in human lives, dollars to build and maintain, and environmental degradation), we will not advance our economy as we must.</p>

                                <div>From the <a href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2012-08-22/news/33326609_1_brooklyn-residents-borough-president-marty-markowitz-fort-greene">NY Daily News</a> comes a <i>Tale of Two Cities </i>(and does not include rural poverty):</div>
<p>
<blockquote>We have more poor people in Brooklyn than the entire population of Detroit; we have more people on food stamps than the entire population of Washington, D.C.,” Gelber said. “Yet there are more wealthy people than in Greenwich, Conn.”</p>
<p>The Daily News scoured Brooklyn for telling statistics about the extremes of grimness and glamor gripping the split-personality borough, and found:</p>
<p>-Sixty-nine people have been shot this year in Brownsville. Four miles away, a mansion at 70 Willow St. in Brooklyn Heights sold for the borough’s highest-ever home price of $12.5 million. -Brooklyn sent five athletes to the Olympics but one in four borough residents is obese. -Brooklyn has 113 colleges and universities but only 29% of borough residents have college degrees.</p>
<p>“It’s absolutely a tale of two Brooklyns, right out of Dickens,” said Joel Berg, executive director of the New York City Coalition Against Hunger. “The divide is getting wider every year.”</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Waves of gentrification that started in the 1980s have brought an influx of mega-bucks and turned once-grimy neighborhoods like Williamsburg into magnets for the rich and trendy.</p>
<p>A big crime reduction in the 1990s was a main driver of moneyed people into Brooklyn, said Jonathan Bowles, director of the Center for an Urban Future. Several years ago, the well-heeled stopped seeing Brooklyn as a bargain-priced alternative to Manhattan — but kept coming anyway.</p>
<p>“It’s an increasingly difficult borough to be middle class,” said Bowles, citing Windsor Terrace and Kensington as neighborhoods where rising real estate prices are displacing moderate-income residents.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Part III &#8211; How to think about time series data.</p>
<p>For reference:<br />Part II  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/why-spendinggdp-is-terrible-horrible-no.html">Federal Spending as a Fraction of GDP</a></p>
<p>Part I  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/a-quick-look-at-federal-spending.html">Federal Spending Growth</a></p>
<p>Some  commentors to the previous posts have rightly concluded that I consider  spending under Obama in the context of historical trends.  In fact, if  you don&#8217;t consider historical trends, you are ignoring the most  important element of context that is available.  I only mentioned trends  briefly in Part II, but the directional changes in the graphs of Parts I  and II implicitly suggest them.</p>
<p>Time series data that  relate to the size of the population, the government, or the economy  generally follow a quasi-exponential growth pattern.  I say <i>quasi-</i> because a perfect exponential growth pattern  results from a continuous  constant rate of growth, while real world growth rates vary from year.   Graph 3 of Part II shows how these variations have occurred over  several decades.  Usually this does not result in a large or permanent  deformation in the shape of a quasi-exponential curve, since the growth  rate typically oscillates irregularly around a mean value that only  changes slowly over time.</p>
<p>Graph 2 in Part II shows that  the spending and GDP growth curves stay close to exponential tracks  over long time spans.  It also illustrates that the recent recession was  one of those rare times when growth rates deviated substantially.</p>
<p>Human  eye-brain coordination doesn&#8217;t deal well with exponential curve  shapes.  Straight lines are much easier to comprehend and extrapolate.   Graphing quasi-exponential data on a log scale reduces the curve to a  quasi-straight line that is much easier to use and understand.</p>
<p>Graph  1 shows Federal Spending and GDP, since 1995, plotted on a log scale.   Constant growth results in a straight line segment, and a higher growth  rate causes a steeper slope.  Zero growth shows up as a horizontal  line.   I&#8217;ve again included a line for 5 times spending, to get a close  overlay with the GDP line.</p>

<p>There  is an upward bend in the spending line in 2000.  This is most easily  seen in the blue line.  During the 90&#8217;s, we can see that GDP grew faster  than spending.  In 2001-2, GDP growth flat-lined, as expected during a  recession. Then, from 20002 to 2008, the growth rates for GDP and  spending were close to identical.  Both lines twist during the most  recent recession.  Curiously, spending growth was flat for a large  portion of 2008.</p>
<p>Since the recession, the spending lines are very close to flat, and GDP growth has been anemic.  Here is a close up.</p>

<p>Graph 3 provides context, all the way back to 1947.  Ponder the inflection points and slope changes at your leisure.</p>

<p>Note  that there are only two flat-ish spots in the spending lines: now, and  during the Eisenhower administration. The current administration has, at  least temporarily, broken the decades-long trend in continuous spending  increases.  </p>
<p>To emphasize the obvious, spending growth  is now very close to zero.  In context, this is remarkable.  Saying  Obama is a profligate spender is a lie.  </p>
<p>In this post, I am not suggesting that the rate of spending growth under any president is good, bad, appropriate or inappropriate.  I am only pointing out what was and is.  </p>
<p>So, this is how you think about time series data.<br />0)  Forget your preconceived notions.    (Frex:I had no idea that spending  growth has essentially stopped until I looked at the data.)<br />1) Identify trends. The history of time series data provides meaningful context.<br />2) Identify break points and trend changes.  These are key data points.<br />3) Note the directions of these changes.<br />4) Think hard about what these observations are actually telling you, not what you want them to say.<br />5) Double down on 4) if you are looking at a ratio.  Ponder that denominator. <br />6) Don&#8217;t cherry pick.  It&#8217;s dishonest.</p>
<p>There  are a lot of ways to look at a data set: linear and log scales, rate of  change, etc.  Chose the one that gives the clearest picture of the data  you want to analyze, or simplifies the analysis, or makes it easier to  understand.  Studying different views can be informative, as can a  comparison of different data sets.  </p>
<p><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=ara">Here is the working page at FRED for the graphs in this post</a>.  I encourage the interested reader to spend some time working with the capabilities of this very powerful tool.</p>
<p>Editorial Comment:<br />In  case it&#8217;s not obvious, I&#8217;ll tell you that I write these posts because  they interest me and I think they generate some knowledge, or at least  information, that is worth sharing.  I have virtually no interest in the  fool&#8217;s errand of convincing anybody that I am right &#8211; either the data  analysis convinces you or it doesn&#8217;t.  So unless you have better data,  or can point out some specific flaw in my reasoning [and then tell me  specifically and in detail how to get it right] don&#8217;t bother arguing  with me.</p>
<p>I appreciate rational discourse, and am always  willing to engage thoughtful readers. I&#8217;m also willing to be proven  wrong by a cogent argument.  That said, though, I don&#8217;t really care if  anyone comments.  At this point, I&#8217;d <i>almost</i> rather nobody  did.  But if you chose to, please do me the courtesy of having your  comment be somewhere in the general vicinity of on-topic.  And &#8211; fair  warning: naked assertions and unsubstantiated ideologically approved  talking points will be scoffed at, so please check that nonsense at the  door.</p>

                                <p>I overheard a conversation at a local restaurant on the impact of the US being dependent on China buying US bonds to finance federal debt.  Usullay missing from such conversations is the % of money involved, whether that is a lot, and what effect it has on federal debt and trade (and some kind of political or &#8216;war&#8217; value?)  Then via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/09/fear-of-china-syndrome.html">Mark Thoma</a> came the Krugman piece on bonds and how the market works in Fear of China syndrome, so thought I would post the Krugman piece and some comment by Mark Sadowski from the post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paul Krugman tries, once again, to explain why there&#8217;s no reason to fear that &#8220;terrible things will happen&#8221; if China stops purchasing our government bonds:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/wicksell-goes-to-china/">Wicksell Goes To China, by Paul Krugman</a>: </p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>The idea that we are at the mercy of the Chinese — that terrible things would happen if they stopped buying our bonds — is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/opinion/its-mitts-world.html?_r=1&#038;hp">very influential</a>. Yet it’s <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/30/fear-of-china-syndrome/">just wrong</a>.<br />Think of it this way: the argument that interest rates would soar if the Chinese bought fewer bonds is the same as the argument that interest rates would soar when the U.S. government sold more bonds — which, as you may recall, was the subject of <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/liquidity-preference-loanable-funds-and-niall-ferguson-wonkish/">fierce debate</a> more than three years ago — and you know how that turned out. </p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>Again, you can think of this in terms <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/natural-born-recovery-killers/">Wicksell</a>: we’re in a situation in which the incipient supply of savings — the amount that people would save at full employment — is greater than the incipient demand for investment. And this excess supply of savings leads to a depressed economy. </p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote><blockquote>What China does by buying bonds is add to the excess savings — which makes our situation worse. (This is just another way of saying that the artificial trade surplus hurts our economy — just another way of stating the same thing). And we want them to do less of it; far from fearing that they will stop, we should welcome the prospect.</p>

<p> This is old news. FYI QE2 ended in June of 2011.</p>
<p>On June 30, 2011 the Fed held $1,617 billion worth of Treasuries:<br />http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20110630/</p>
<p>According to the most recent release (August 30) the Fed now holds $1,639 billion worth of Treasuries.<br />http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/08/31/1140881/if-qe3-is-so-close-why-is-the-feds-balance-sheet-shrinking/</p>
<p>According to SIFMA:<br />http://www.sifma.org/research/statistics.aspx</p>
<p>$1,274 billion in Treasuries were issued between the end of June 2011 and the end of July 2012, meaning the Fed has bought less than 2% of all Treasuries issued in that time.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Fed&#8217;s balance sheet has actually been shrinking since December. That&#8217;s why there are tons of stories such as this if you bother to do the google:<br />http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2012/08/31/1140881/if-qe3-is-so-close-why-is-the-feds-balance-sheet-shrinking/<br />..<br /><i>Correct current release lin</i>k:<br />http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/Current/</p>
<p>Matt C asked:<br />Even if QE2 is old news, what is the big change in the financial landscape since 2011?</p>
<p>Was it not bad in 2011 for China to be buying bonds then? If China was depressing the economy by buying bonds then, why wasn&#8217;t QE2 doing the same thing?</p>
<p>Mark A. Sadowski answers:<br />It makes a big difference who&#8217;s buying the bonds.</p>
<p>Krugman describes the situation as an excess of savings over desired investment. But another way of looking at it is as an excess demand for money over its supply.</p>
<p>When the Chinese buy US Treasury bonds they increase the demand for US dollars and drive up the dollar&#8217;s value (they were of course doing this intentionally to increase their net exports). When the Fed buys bonds they&#8217;re adding to the supply of dollars. This of course drives down the value of the dollar.</p>
<p>Increased demand for dollars is depressing. Increased supply of dollars is stimulative.</p>

<p> US wages trail 10 OECD countries, but with higher unemployment than 9 of them</p>
<p> Contra <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/09/new_labor.php">Eric Cantor</a>, Labor Day celebrates the importance of labor and the labor movement in American history. But the bluster of Cantor, where he celebrates the so-called job creators, does illustrate that organized labor has been in decline in this country for quite some time.    </p>
<p>One result of having a <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/labor-day-us-has-fifth-lowest-union.html">weak labor movement</a> is that average wages in the United States have fallen behind those of 10 other industrialized democracies that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). What is most confounding, for Republicans at least, is that nine of these countries also have lower unemployment, which contradicts their view that high wages (and <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/labor-day-of-nine-oecd-members-with.html">high minimum wages</a>) harm employment.     </p>
<p>The table below below is constructed from data at OECD StatExtracts, showing the average earnings of all wage and salary workers in each country, as well as its most recent unemployment rate (usually July 2012).<br />Source: <a href="http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx#">OECD StatExtracts</a>.</p>

<p>For average wages, select data by theme, then labour, then earnings, then average annual wages, and use &#8220;2011 USD exchange rates and 2011 constant prices&#8221; for each country. For unemployment, select data by theme, then labour, then labour force statistics, then short-term statistics, then short-term labour market statistics, then harmonized unemployment rates.<br />    <br />This table does not make use of purchasing power parity (PPP) conversions to wages (and the U.S. in fact has the highest wages when adjusted for PPP), for a very important reason. Essentially, the PPP calculation adjusts actual exchange rates for differences in the cost of living between countries. In practice, this means downward adjustments for expensive countries like Norway (where I had a personal pan pizza for $25 on my honeymoon six years ago; the <i>New York Times</i> recently published <a href="http://frugaltraveler.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/24/scandinavia-on-125-a-day/?ref=travel">more examples</a>) and upward adjustments for developing countries and even Eastern European countries. As I note in <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/investmentincentivesandtheglobalcompetitionforcapital/KennethPThomas"><i>Investment Incentives and the Global Competition for Capital</i></a>, gross national income per capita for the Czech Republic in 2006 was $12,680 at actual exchange rates, but $21,470 at PPP (page 99).<br />    <br />The reason we should ignore PPP when dealing with wages and jobs is that a company deciding to invest in one place rather than another has to pay the wages using the actual exchange rate and is not affected by PPP. Thus, if there is an effect of wages on employment, that will be a response to what an employer actually has to pay to hire someone, not a hypothetical measure of how well off the worker is in terms of PPP-adjusted dollars. The data here does not show any negative effect of wages on unemployment.<br />    <br />Moreover, I would argue that living in a high-wage, high-cost location has distinct advantages over living in a low-wage, low cost location, even if after adjusting for cost of living (via PPP or within a single country) the lower wage location has &#8220;higher&#8221; pay. One important reason is that having extra cash gives you extra options. You will have a higher retirement benefit and will keep it if you move to a lower-cost area, whereas the reverse is not possible. You will have better quality services on average, particularly health care. It is far easier for you to vacation in a low-cost location than it will be for someone in a low-cost location to vacation to a high-cost location ($25 personal pan pizzas!).</p>
<p>Your high salary will be the benchmark if you take a job in a lower-cost location. If you economize from the standard basket of goods used to measure cost of living, your benefit will be higher in the high-cost area. Of course, a full treatment of this issue requires another post, but the big point is that high wages do not necessarily create unemployment and reducing wages is not the route to middle class prosperity.</p>

<p>New Report on Getting the Best Care</p>
<p>Both Matthew Yglesias at Slate and Sarah Kliff at WonkBlog and a host of other sites have posted some interesting results coming out of a recent study by the Institute of Medicine  <a href="http://iom.edu/~/media/Files/Report%20Files/2012/Best-Care/Best%20Care%20at%20Lower%20Cost_Recs.pdf">Best Care at Lower Cost: The Path to Continuously Learning Health Care in America</a>. </p>
<p>Unfortunately as a lowly and unpaid (99% of the time) blogger, I do not have access to the entire report. What I do have is a abstract of what the report is about and some of the charts placed on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/07/we-spend-750-billion-on-unnecessary-health-care-two-charts-explain-why/">Wonkblog</a>.</p>
<p>We spend $750 billion on unnecessary health care. Two charts explain why. This report documents much of the whys to a much needed Healthcare Reform in the numeric of it. Phillip Longman in his book  <i>The Best Care Anywhere</i>  touches upon a similar transition in the VA administration and the experiences of his and Timothy Noah&#8217;s wives in being treated for cancer. Unfortunately, the best named hospitals and the best insurance does not guarantee the best care. Too much is spent inefficiently on the wrong type of care.</p>
<p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-nmEYytaUnt4/UEyU4-02oYI/AAAAAAAABAQ/NZ5WB2Ry20o/s1600-h/clip_image002%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="clip_image002" border="0" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-gWO_1R8_LwQ/UEyU5MOIJII/AAAAAAAABAY/DhgNPBzveDo/clip_image002_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" title="clip_image002"></a></p>
<p>The second series of chart is an accounting of how some of these expenditures are made within the system. Again, this is something which Phillip Longman touched upon with his book on the VA and how they overcame the inefficiencies. Sarah Kliff at Wonkblog calls it creating an environment in which it is easy to create waste. When healthcare and its associated industries were not the monsters in cost, no one paid attention to the cost, loss of efficiency, and the lack of quality outcome in treating patients. We spent for the services and not the outcome with the results being a higher cost.</p>
<p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-t6BCYKvXfgQ/UEyU5v2z9uI/AAAAAAAABAg/Ip6xXZHa_RM/s1600-h/clip_image004%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="clip_image004" border="0" height="150" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-WVkHKxG-csU/UEyU5_8NAGI/AAAAAAAABAo/P2jJ3KfoqJw/clip_image004_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" title="clip_image004" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Constantly targeted within today&#8217;s healthcare system is the cost of treating the elderly. While it is true as we grow older, the costs of treating us increase due to our aging and failure to care for ourselves. Within the system it is easy to have increased waste as treatments and records may not be logged to computer leading to duplicate treatments and a lack of coordination amongst way to many doctors in treating patients. It has happened where a group of consulting doctors can be describing treatments when the oncologist knows there is little more to be done.</p>
<p>What does the IOM recommend? I will leave you with Sarah Kliff&#8217;s post on Wonk Blog to find out. <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/07/we-spend-750-billion-on-unnecessary-health-care-two-charts-explain-why/"><i>What&#8217;s Possible for Healthcare</i></a></p>
<p>Getting back to today&#8217;s politics between Romney and Ryan vs Obama, would you want more of the same? More of today&#8217;s private market with its rising healthcare cost is precisely what is being advocated by Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan. More to come.</p>
