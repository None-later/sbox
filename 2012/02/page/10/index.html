                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This article caught my attention mainly because I hadn&#8217;t heard much about the court battles on <a href="http://www.dodbuzz.com/2010/09/28/supreme-court-takes-up-a-12-case/">terminating funding for the A-12</a> because I thought it was done.  But the inability of DOD to submit documentation that might justify that the A-12 was not viable due to classified and secret information and specs made an impression on me as a catch-22 of funding for non-viable projects&#8230;making it horribly difficult to &#8216;learn from mistakes&#8217; so to speak.     </p>
<p>Here is a response from ilsm to my sending him the link:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dan,</p>
<p>The A-12 a blast from the past!     </p>
<p>I believe the Supreme Court last year decided the Navy/US Government would not be paid back “progress payments” paid prior to the termination of the A-12 sometime in the early 1990’s.     Here is an article form Feb 1999 about the case as it stood then, it kept going until 2010!     </p>
<p><a href="http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1999-02/12-legacy-it-wasnt-airplane-it-was-train-wreck">http://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/1999-02/12-legacy-it-wasnt-airplane-it-was-train-wreck</a></p>
<p>I had read the linked article years ago and am surprised to find it.  In the past 8 or so years I have only kept up with the A-12 headlines, when I saw them.     The A-12 was a stealthy fighter concept, a carrier based version much different [of course] to the already retired F-117.  Purportedly, the free world depends on things like the A-12.        </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />The interesting issue to me is why then Sec Def Cheney terminated the contract for “convenience”, a termination used when the service decides it does not need the equipment.     The Navy’s acquisition approach was to have Mc Donald Douglas (now owned by Boeing) build 12 of the A-12’s for test and evaluation.  The technology was risky and the specifications challenging, for example they had to keep the weight under 80,000 pounds which was the limits of the elevators on aircraft carriers and likely a big deal to beef them up (maybe the decks cannot handle the load of the landings either).</p>
<p>I am neither an expert in stealth nor an expert in aircraft carriers, mostly Air Force.  The contract type for this risky development was “fixed price”, which means Mc Donald Douglas signed up to deliver the 12 airplanes at a specification at a set time and contract price.  In order words the contractors assumed al the risk.     </p>
<p>As it happens today, and then Mc Donald Douglas promised to “name the song in 5 notes”, but needed about 20 special notes not on contract, they kept the Navy at bay, who would have done some insider contracting “magic” to raise the price until a contract auditor discovered the A-12 would not get any airplanes in the time and money Mc Donald Douglas had entered into the contract to deliver.</p>
<p>   George HW Bush was president and his advisors had some interest in cutting DoD spending [FY 91 spending had declined to 475B from 553B in 1989 a decline which was disrupted by the first Gulf war, but hit $400B in 2011 dollars in 1999] and finding new ways to do acquisition which was as much a mess as today.  </p>
<p>So, through a fair amount of trading and evading it was decided to <em>terminate for convenience</em>.  The better <em>termination was for default</em>, and I do not know why Cheney directed the type of termination, nor why a Navy contracting authority would not set him straight.     </p>
<p>Cheney could have done three things, one being convenience.  He could have terminated for “default”, which they were doing, or he could have called Mc Donald Douglas in and said:  “a contract is a bond, do the job [which is impossible given the traditional ineptitude of defense contractors].     The point in Fensler’s article, which is valid today, is that the Navy needed Mc Donald Douglas and would have (without the publicity) kept shoveling good money after bad for  the A-12, (like the AF did F-22 and now F-35).     The good thing is despite the fact the government does not get its progress payments back, the Navy has not been saddled for twenty years and likely $200B in costs to try and make the A-12 fly, a burden the USAF has successfully held up so their generals could have good jobs…</p>
<p>…     Bottom line from the Supremes:  the military industrial complex does not get real contracts, as in common law, they get paid whether they meet their promises or not.</p></blockquote>

                                <div>
<div>Updated: Renewable Germany bailing out Nuclear France</div>
<p>  <br />I just read the following in an <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/view/2012/02/07-2">article by a Mr. Bill McKibben</a> and thought it to be an interesting perspective on why climate change/global warming is being so vigorously denied.   </div>
<blockquote><div>If we spew 565 gigatons more carbon into the atmosphere, we’ll quite possibly go right past that reddest of red lines. But the oil companies, private and state-owned, have current reserves on the books equivalent to 2,795 gigatons &#8212; five times more than we can ever safely burn. It has to stay in the ground.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Put another way, in ecological terms it would be extremely prudent to write off $20 trillion worth of those reserves. In economic terms, of course, it would be a disaster, first and foremost for shareholders and executives of companies like ExxonMobil (and people in places like Venezuela).</div>
<div></div>
<div><i>If you run an oil company, this sort of write-off is the disastrous future staring you in the face as soon as climate change is taken as seriously as it should be, and that’s far scarier than drought and flood. It’s why you’ll do anything &#8212; including fund an endless campaigns of lies &#8212; to avoid coming to terms with its reality.</i></div>
</blockquote>
<div>Never thought of the resistance to moving away from carbon fuels as an issue of having to write off company value in order to save the planet.  As shown with the housing bubble, writing off inflated value (inflated for what ever reason) is a rather difficult thing to do.  I mean, when you have so much down stream of that artificial value dependent on it (think currency based on oil), the engineering challenge is like playing Jenga only no one will be laughing if you fail and the tower falls.  Also, you have a timer running in this version of Jenga.</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>I believe Mr. McKibben refers to the issue as a bubble in that the current price of raw carbon fuel is based on the idea that fuel in general is becoming less available.  But fuel or energy is not less available. It is only one source of fuel that is becoming less in quantity.  The only means to keep this conflation of less carbon based energy means less energy fuel in total is to deny the application of science in the energy market place as it relates to a competitor product.   It is artificial price manipulation via psych-ops.</div>
<div></div>
<div>In other words, the only way to keep the carbon energy market alive is to not have a free energy market.  Part of assuring not having a free energy market is to deny the need for a free energy market, thus, deny climate change do to human extraction of carbon from the ground and it&#8217;s ever increasing rate of conversion to a gas of CO2.  It is artificial price manipulation via psych-ops.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s take the write off issue one step further.  How does the value of a company such as Exxon/Mobil which is based on ever rising price do to ever declining product with ever increasing demand keep this model for valuing the company if the product becomes essentially limitless?  Now we&#8217;re up against our entire paradigm as to how we understand free market value and thus construct value.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Carbon based energy is currently view as land.  No new land is being made and demand is rising thus ever increasing value.  The proper model for carbon fuel is that of a market where over time the product becomes obsolete.  This I think is the fault in thinking that has created the aberrant paradigm which lead to the bubble Mr. McKibben sees. Our entire energy market, viewed in this way is a complete illusion as seen from the owners side of the energy equation and a complete delusion as seen from the market economist side of the energy equation, though I would say the economist delusion has lead the owners to create their illusion.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Just one more problem with running an economy based on the efficiency of money as oppose to the efficiency of people.</p>
<p>Update:</p>
<div>From <a href="http://real-economics.blogspot.com/2012/02/cold-snap-triggers-renewables-milestone.html">Real Economics</a> I read an article from Der Spiegel regarding France struggling with electricity shortages do to the cold spell.  Seem France, not normally experiencing cold winters uses electricity for heating homes.  This year they needed 7000 megawatts per hour more power.  100 gigawatts one evening was need, the equivalent of 80 nuclear power plants.  Germany was sending them a net 3000 megawatts/hour because:   </div>
<blockquote><div>It is interesting, said the federal environment minister, that Germany, especially in these days with a very high demand, can even export power—thanks to photovoltaic and wind energy. &#8220;We had in the last days a capacity of up to 10,000 megawatts of solar power, which corresponds to the output of ten nuclear power plants, and up to 11,000 megawatts of wind power,&#8221; said Röttgen.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Read another take here at <a href="http://k.lenz.name/LB/?p=6144">Lenz Blog</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is significant, because back in May of 2011 all the rage was how France was bailing out Germany after Germany announced its nuclear generation shut down.  As with Jonathan Larson at Real Economics, no one is saying this means we can scrap all other power generation tomorrow as <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,809439,00.html">this Spiegel article</a> notes the lack of solar generated power in Germany during a spell this winter and the need to import electricity. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The January article (not pro solar at all) notes:</div>
<blockquote><div>Until now, Merkel had consistently touted the environmental sector&#8217;s &#8220;opportunities for exports, development, technology and jobs.&#8221; But now even members of her own staff are calling it a massive money pit.</div>

All the more reason to view carbon based energy in the energy market as a product that can be made obsolescent.  You know, a true free market with competition which purpose is to serves the efficiency of people and not money. Maybe then even Germany would not be so reactionary when their plan stumbles.  Heck, it took the Wright Brothers over a 1000 flights, just to learn how to fly!  Over 200 wings and airfoils!  They did not concern themselves with the issue of scaling it up for use by a planet of 6 billion people.</p></div>

<div>Stick to your plan Germany because you have the correct intention. </div>

                                <p><strong><em>Or:</em> It’s The Velocity, Stupid.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><strong></strong>I got quite a bit of blowback on my recent post suggesting that <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/why-economists-dont-understand-accounting-or-business.html">economists don’t understand accounting</a>.</p>
<p>In response I give you Exhibit A: the almost-ubiquitous notion that more saving increases the supply of “loanable funds” — hence that more saving <em>causes</em> or at least allows more investment. (The absolute classic fallacy of the S=I accounting identity.)</p>
<p>On casual consideration, it seems like it would be right, right? You spend less than your income, so you have more money (stuffed in your mattress?), and you can lend it out.</p>
<p>Or more likely: you “put money in the bank” – deposit more than you withdraw — so the bank has more money; it can lend more.</p>
<p>It’s A Wonderful Life.</p>
<p>Here’s <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=B-iNoOEoSnkC&#038;lpg=PA61&#038;dq=saving%20%22loanable%20funds%22&#038;pg=PA60#v=onepage&#038;q=saving%20%22loanable%20funds%22&#038;f=false">Mankiw in his textbook</a>, saying exactly that:<br />
<blockquote>Saving is the supply of loanable funds — households lend their saving to investors or deposit their saving in a bank that then loans the funds out.</p></blockquote>
<p>But:</p>
<p>1. A little careful consideration shows that this casual consideration is logically incoherent — just plain wrong, by accounting identity.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>2. Economists are not supposed to be thinking, giving their sage advice, or corrupting our youth based on casual consideration.</p>
<p>Think about it:</p>
<div>You get $100,000 in wages. Your employers’ bank account is debited, and yours is credited. Your bank can lend against your higher balance; your employer’s bank can’t. Net zero.*</div>
<div>You spend $75,000. It’s transferred from your account to other people’s/businesses’ bank accounts. Their banks can lend more, yours can lend less.</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Is the total stock of loanable funds affected by whether the money is on deposit at your bank, your employer’s bank, or the banks of people you bought stuff from? No.</p>
<p>Meantime, you <em>don’t</em> spend $25,000. You “save” it. The money sits there in your checking account. If the action of spending — transferring money from one account to another — doesn’t change the total stock, how could <em>not</em> transferring money do so? Your bank still has the money, which it can lend out. Other banks still don’t, and can’t.</p>
<p>It may help to think about this as if there was only one bank. (Which is not so far off. Bank deposits all consolidate back to accounts at the Fed.) Every person and business has an account. All the spending/transfers (or non-transfers, a.k.a. “saving”) just shift deposits between accounts, with no change in the (single) bank’s total deposits.</p>
<p>So the saving/spending mix has no effect on the stock of loanable funds. Shifting (or not shifting) those stocks around has no aggregate effect on the total stock.</p>
<p>But what about the flow — <em>new</em> loans from banks? Again: no.</p>
<p>Here’s a behavioral, rather than accounting-based assertion — not a controversial one, I think: In any period, banks in aggregate lend more — “print” more new money and deposit it in people’s/businesses’ accounts — because they think they can make money doing it at current interest rates. They think that for one primary reason: they are confidently optimistic about future prosperity — borrowers’ future income streams. If they’re less confidently optimistic they lend less, or ask for higher interest rates — which has the same effect: less lending.</p>
<p>Likewise borrowers: they borrow because they think future conditions will be good, and they’ll be able to service their loans at the asking rate out of strong income streams (and/including rising financial asset values).</p>
<p>Likewise spenders: they spend (that new) money because they think it will yield good returns from investment, and/or because they think they can consume today and be able to earn more money to pay for it (repay the loans) in the future.</p>
<p>So how does the saving/spending mix affect those expectations? Another behavioral assertion: Those expectations are set, to a great degree, by current conditions, because they’re the best predictor we’ve got. It’s difficult at best to predict future “shocks” that will change those conditions. Or as the Eight Ball says: “The future is … unclear.” Life is uncertain.</p>
<p>So how does a higher proportion of saving to spending affect current conditions?</p>
<p>It makes them worse. GDP <em>is</em> spending. Less spending (as a proportion of either income or wealth) means less economic activity. Less velocity. Less transactions. Less surplus from trade. Lower GDP. People, businesses, and banks, borrowers and lenders, are less prosperous, and less optimistic. So banks lend less, borrowers borrow less, and (in a potential downward spiral) spenders spend less.</p>
<p>Takeaway: An increased saving/spending proportion has no effect on the stock of loanable funds (it can’t), and it has only a second-order, expectation-driven behavioral effect on flows — it decreases them.</p>
<p>You really have to wonder sometimes where economists get this stuff that they put in their textbooks.</p>
<p>Nick Rowe attempted to save this conceptual situation recently in a comment posted <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/an-mmt-thought-experiment-the-arithmetic-and-political-mechanics-of-net-financial-assets.html#comment-3472">hereabouts</a> (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Suppose there’s an increased demand for financial assets by households</strong> (a rightward shift in the demand curve). Will that increased demand lead to an increased quantity of investment by firms and an increased quantity of financial assets sold to households (a movement along a supply curve)? It may do. That depends on the model. <strong>It’s a behavioural question, not an accounting question.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>His questions in the middle, and the last statement, are completely on the money. But his explanation begins right in the midst of the conceptual confusion, putting the modeling cart before the behavioral horse. The behavior doesn’t “depend on the model”; the model’s accuracy and usefulness depends on its <em>assumed</em> human response to incentives and constraints.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, rather, he’s climbed aboard the wrong behavioral horse — one that is wandering off rather aimlessly.</p>
<p>The “desire to save” is a conceptual representation, a mini-model, if you will, of one aspect of the economic situation. I’m suggesting that that construct is outside of, peripheral and irrelevant to, the behavioral chain of cause and effect.</p>
<p>People might want to save more/spend less in aggregate for various reasons:</p>
<p>• Times are tough — GDP and employment are weak — and they’re worried about future ability to consumption.</p>
<p>• Times are good, and they’re satisfying all their consumption desires.</p>
<p>• Rich people have a larger proportion of income and wealth, and their lower marginal propensity to consume drags down aggregate spending, relative to income and wealth.</p>
<p>Or some other scenario. (As Keynes said — not looking up the exact quote here – <em>all</em> economic activity is driven by the desire to consume.)</p>
<p>In the second scenario banks will want to lend more — but <em>not </em>because people and businesses (want to) save more. If that were true, banks would also want to lend more in the first scenario — which is completely contrary to what actually happens. (The results in the third scenario seem uncertain.)</p>
<p>Here’s a syllogism to make this widespread confusion clearer:</p>
<div>More investment results in more prosperity.</p>
</div>
<div>More saving results in more investment.</p>
</div>
<div>More pessimism (or less-confident optimism) results in more saving. (I think monetarists will stipulate to this.)</p>
</div>
<div>So more pessimism results in more prosperity!</p>
</div>
<p>Mankiw’s conceptual confusion is inevitable, and arises from two causes:</p>
<p>1. He’s starting with snaky (and conceptually confused) assumptions about the sources of human behavior, and:</p>
<p>2. New but related subject: He’s trying to think about flows (and get tender young minds to think about flows) using static, of-an-instant models like the standard S/D and IS-LM diagrams. The problem, when you’re trying to think about “supply,” is that a flow <em>can’t exist</em> in an instant (only stocks can); it’s a meaningless, impossible concept. And since stocks in our discussion here are unaffected by saving, he’s in a pickle, cause it’s all about flows. (And no: “comparative-static” methods don’t solve the conceptual confusion; they arguably only contribute to it because they impart the illusion of time and dynamism.)</p>
<p>The only way (that I know of) to model “flow supply” in a conceptually coherent way – or even think or talk about it really, which is mental modeling — is using a <a href="http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2011/05/16/a-dynamic-monetary-multi-sectoral-model-of-production/">dynamic simulation model</a>. Of late I’ve been quite taken with the power grid as a good metaphor for a dynamic model of the economy — one that I’ll expand and expound upon in a future post.</p>
<p>For now I’ll leave you with this: <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1907357">Clower/Burshaw</a> on the difference between “stock supply” and “flow supply,” or peruse the literature <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&#038;q=%22stock+supply%22+%22flow+supply%22">here</a>. Nick also <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;ion=1#sclient=psy-ab&#038;hl=en&#038;prmdo=1&#038;site=webhp&#038;tbm=blg&#038;source=hp&#038;q=%22Nick+rowe%22+(%22nominal+supply%22+OR+%22nominal+demand%22)&#038;pbx=1&#038;oq=%22Nick+rowe%22+(%22nominal+supply%22+OR+%22nominal+demand%22)&#038;aq=f&#038;aqi=&#038;aql=&#038;gs_sm=e&#038;gs_upl=609l8992l1l9318l16l16l0l0l0l0l150l1034l14.2l16l0&#038;prmdo=1&#038;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&#038;fp=862141011cc102a&#038;ion=1&#038;biw=1269&#038;bih=634">talks quite a bit</a> about the largely forgotten old 70s notion of “nominal” (roughly: “potential”) supply and demand — though mainly regarding money, not real goods.</p>
<p>I almost never see any consideration of these seemingly crucial concepts in economic discussions — much less cogent analysis, or incorporation of said concepts.</p>
<p>Which leads me to ask a question of economists:</p>
<div>Are you sure that you’re <em>perfectly clear</em> on what you mean when you use the words “supply” and “demand”?</div>
<p>Are we?</p>
<p>* I won’t even touch here on the widespread misconception among economists regarding bank lending, except to say that in practice <a href="https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;ion=1#sclient=psy-ab&#038;hl=en&#038;site=webhp&#038;source=hp&#038;q=%22banks%20are%20not%20reserve%20constrained%22&#038;pbx=1&#038;oq=&#038;aq=&#038;aqi=&#038;aql=&#038;gs_sm=&#038;gs_upl=&#038;fp=cd966fbc5ee5cb60&#038;ion=1&#038;ion=1&#038;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.,cf.osb&#038;fp=cd966fbc5ee5cb60&#038;biw=1269&#038;bih=634&#038;ion=1">bank lending is not constrained by deposits</a> — banks lend most of their deposits then lend (much) more based on their excess capital (times X) — which, thus, is their effective constraint on lending. Not deposits.<br /><em>Cross-posted at <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=4792">Asymptosis</a>.</em></p>

                                <p>Let&#8217;s ignore that three of his four wins (including two last night) have come in non-binding caucuses and take a quick look at The Size of the Santorum Surge.</p>
<p>Over at <a href="http://xnerg.blogspot.com/">Skippy</a>, Our Leader posted a link to a discussion of whether &#8220;Romney&#8217;s strengths&#8221; could beat Obama. I wisecracked, without looking at the data, that the total Republican votes in all three states were lower than the daily NYC subway ridership.</p>
<p>My bad.  That&#8217;s not even a ballpark comparison.  On its lowest day, the NYC subway <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_Subway">averages more than 2,350,000 riders</a>. (That&#8217;s a lot of elitists, Newt.)  It averages more than three million (3,000,000) on Saturdays, more than four million (4,000,000) riders a day, and more than five million (5,000,000) every weekday.</p>
<p>By comparison, here are <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/07/map-caucus-primary-2012-results_n_1260890.html">the number of votes cast yesterday in Republican primaries/caucuses</a>:
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2pDstK_WsPk/TzKcWZ0gCGI/AAAAAAAAAug/q6Ce9gc-KCg/s1600/20120207%2BRepublican%2BVoters.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2pDstK_WsPk/TzKcWZ0gCGI/AAAAAAAAAug/q6Ce9gc-KCg/s320/20120207%2BRepublican%2BVoters.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Clearly, we need a smaller comparative to make the turnout appear more impressive. So let&#8217;s look at one of my favorite demographic measures, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_United_States_Metropolitan_Statistical_Areas">Metropolitan Statistical Areas</a> (MSAs).</p>
<p>Keeping in mind that the MSA includes the areas around the cities named, the total voters in the three Republican elections yesterday would occupy&#8230;the 144th largest MSA,* just behind Eugene-Springfield, Oregon (351,715).</p>
<p>The Santorum Surge: Smaller than Peoria (#135), bigger than Kalamazoo (#148).  </p>
<p>*I resist saying &#8220;Gross!&#8221; at this point.</p>

<p><strong>LES MISERABLES:   SOCIAL SECURITY</strong><br />Javert And Evil</p>
<p>From a message from the <em><strong>National Consumer Law Center</strong></em> (reference <a href="mailto:msaunders@nclc.org">msaunders@nclc.org</a>):  <br />
<blockquote><strong>&#8220;</strong>It’s perfectly fine for a person who failed to pay their child support to end up penniless and living in their car, and to die that way.<strong>”</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>– High Ranking U.S. Treasury Official, in response to a request for help with Treasury’s rules which allow 100% of Social Security benefits to be taken to pay for decades-old child support.  February 3, 2012.           As the result of the concurrence of two new Treasury rules, elderly and disabled Social Security recipients will soon lose all of their benefits to old child support orders.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>•   As of March, 2013, all recipients of federal benefits must receive benefits through electronic deposit, either through deposit directly into a bank account, or using the Treasury authorized Direct Express Card. (31 CFR § 208.4.) </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><strong>·</strong>  Treasury’s new garnishment rule, intended to protect benefits in bank accounts from garnishment allows child support orders to garnish all of the funds in the accounts. (31 CFR 221.4.)   </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>As a result,  65% of the recipient’s benefits will be withheld pursuant to administrative seizures and paid directly to the child support office.  <u>The remaining 35% will be deposited into the beneficiary’s bank account, where it will be seized in full through a bank garnishment.</u></p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Most SS recipients who owe child support are old and or disabled.  Their children are grown and the child  support is owed to the state.  The amounts of the orders have ballooned to tens of thousands because of annual 10 or 12% interest rates applied.<br /><a name="more"></a><strong>·</strong>    Although blind and elderly, Mr. W.  found a legal services lawyer in September 2010 when the Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) ordered Treasury to take $217 from his Social Security check (which normally is $775).  Five weeks after the legal services lawyer filed papers, the OCSE stopped the garnishment as it was required to do under New York State law.  But in January 2011, the OCSE&#8217;s computer matched and froze Mr. W. &#8216;s bank account, depriving him of his entire Social Security payment.  Again the legal services lawyer interceded, and after several weeks, the OCSE returned Mr. W. &#8216;s Social Security.  But in July 2011, the OCSE&#8217;s computer froze Mr. W. &#8216;s account again.  South Brooklyn Legal Services fought to retrieve  his Social Security payment so Mr. W.  could pay his rent. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><strong>·</strong>    Mr. R.  is sixty two years old, homebound, and lives entirely off of his $780 Social Security payment. In June 2011, the OCSE ordered the U.S. Treasury to garnish 65% of Mr. R.  Social Security check for child support arrears owed to his adult children.  This reduced his check to $273.  Unable to pay his rent or feed himself for an entire month, R.  protested to the OCSE.  After reviewing evidence in July 2011 showing Mr. R.  lived below the poverty line, the OCSE stopped the garnishment as New York law requires.  But the OCSE did not reprogram its computers.  On August 5, 2011, Mr. Richard&#8217;s bank account containing his restored, direct deposit Social Security check was matched and seized by the OCSE&#8217;s computer.  Although a legal services lawyer sent Mr. R.&#8217;s bank records to the OSCE, the account remains restrained.  So desperate remains Mr. R.  that he went by access-a-ride in his wheelchair to the local OSCE office in person, begging for money for rent.  An  indifferent bureaucrat told him to come back with an award letter form Social Security and perhaps he would do something.  Mr. R.  called Social Security and was told he would receive an award letter in seven to ten business days.  And because the Social Security Administration could not switch his electronic check to paper until 6 weeks later, his next month’s check sailed electronically into his frozen account where it was also unreachable to him.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have argued in this space that Social Security is the only way ordinary workers have to save their own money for retirement in a way that is protected from inflation and market losses. People of a Libertarian Persuasion have argued that the money is NOT safe from “the government.” In general that has not been the case&#8230;  only one person has lost his Social Security money because of “the government,”  and he was a deported communist. that is, someone we the people, though our government, are perfectly willing to cheat and cause great harm.  I have thought the government would not be able to cheat and harm the entire population of Social Security contributors and recipients.   </p>
<p>But “the government”  appears to be embarked on a course to give aid and comfort to those who say “you can’t trust the government.”   </p>
<p>Well, you can’t.  Unless WE have the decency to protect “the least of these” against the evil that can and does appear from time to time in “our government,” we can expect the time will come when we are among that select minority which the government can cheat and harm with impunity because “we the people” don’t give a damn.</p>
<p>It’s not Social Security that is at fault here.  It is us.   </p>
<p>Let it be understood that I am not arguing that folks should not be required to pay their child support.  But hitting someone old or disabled with a decades old bill, with accrued interest, that takes everything they have to live on, and saying, “It’s perfectly fine for a person who failed to pay their child support to end up penniless and living in their car, and to die that way,&#8221;  &#8230;is evil.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is part of an ongoing &#8220;conspiracy&#8221; to discredit Social Security, or if it is just the random evil that can occur at all times&#8230; in government or out of it.  But it is evil.  And we should stop it.</p>

<blockquote><p>The reason is not a recount based on the 2010 census, nor is it purely demographics, nor is it Obamanomics. The reason is severe and sustained fundamental economic weakness, coupled with existing purposely-distorted definitions of what constitutes &#8220;unemployment&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>These days, I probably spend more time speaking to reporters (from as far away as Brazil and Italy) about Super PACs than about any other election law subject.  There is a lot of misinformation floating out there about what Super PACs are, where they came from, the relationship to Citizens United, and the ability of super PACs to coordinate with candidates without running afoul of the FEC disclosure rules.  For those looking for basic information from what I’ve written, I point reporters to my <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/09/opinion/hasen-super-pacs/index.html?eref=rss_topstories&#038;utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20rss%2Fcnn_topstories%20%28RSS%3A%20Top%20Stories%29">recent CNN oped</a>, <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=28207">this blog post</a> on whether <em>Citizens United</em> created Super PACs, and t<a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=28617">his blog post</a> which highlights the kinds of coordination which are currently permissible under FEC rules.<br /><strong>&#8230;</strong><br /><strong>. The Secret Money is Shifting to 501c4s, and It Demands a Legislative Response. </strong>Last night ace election lawyer Rob Kelner <a href="https://twitter.com/#">tweeted</a>: “Biggest story today: Crossroads’ c4 raised more than its Super PAC. Confirming that media is missing the boat by focusing on Super PACs.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote> My big concern before yesterday was that we would see a lot of transfers of money from 501c4s to affiliated Super PACs to shield the identity of donors to Super PACs. I’m still trying to get a handle on how much of this took place (apparently less than I thought). But the reason these transfers are not taking place is that it appears the 501c4s are engaging in much more <em>direct </em>election-related activity than they have in the past. That is, we are seeing some 501c4s becoming pure election vehicles. The relation of 501c4s to super pacs is now like the past relation between 527s and pacs—these are now the vehicles of questionable legality to influence elections. While <a href="http://www.mediteerenian.salon.com/2012/01/31/congress_can_fix_the_super_pac_problem/singleton/">Adam Skaggs</a> is rightly focused on fixing the coordination rules for Super PACs, this seems to be fighting yesterday’s war already. The key is to stop 501c4s from becoming shadow super PACs. Yes, campaign finance reform community, it has become this bad: I want <em>more</em> super PACs, because the 501c4 alternative is worse&#8230;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>By <strong>Noni Mausa</strong></p>
<p><strong>Double Double &#8212;  The Absolute Simplest Look at Wages and Pensions  </strong><br />     <br />One of the best loved Canadian drinks is the famed Double-Double, a   <br />big coffee with two creams and two sugars from the Tim Horton’s coffee    <br />shop chain.  Millions of double-doubles warm grateful workers hands    <br />and wake up their brains on the way to work each morning.  Want to    <br />raise a cheer from a Canadian crowd?  Just toast the double-double.<br />But Canadian workers need more than coffee to see them through.  They   <br />need wages and pensions.  How big do they need to be?  In a time of    <br />drooping wages and wavering pensions, we need to know.  Let’s approach    <br />the wages, retirement and pension discussion by simplifying it as much    <br />as possible.</p>
<p>Let’s assume that the work life extends from age 20 to 60.  The work   <br />that people do before and after those ages is balanced by people who    <br />are not able to work at all, for whatever reason.  We’re talking    <br />averages here, spread across 33 million Canadians.<br />So for half your life you work, and for half (birth to 20, and 60 to   <br />80) you don’t.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />As you can see, on average every person working must earn double what   <br />it costs him to live.  That extra money pays for the child the worker    <br />is before he goes to work, and the senior he is afterwards.  For the    <br />population of Canada to stay level, each Canadian must raise one    <br />child, and he must support himself once he retires.  What it costs to    <br />do that is the “lifetime wage.”</p>
<p>How can we calculate that?</p>
<p>Well, to start we can set a lower limit.  Each individual must earn or   <br />somehow acquire no less than what he needs to stay alive.  A rough    <br />guess for that number is around $800/month.  That’s in the range of    <br />what single welfare recipients receive.  I have no idea how they live    <br />on that, but thousands of them do.</p>
<p>Full time minimum wage is roughly double that, about $1600/month   <br />before taxes, about $1350 after. (Manitoba minimum wage currently    <br />$10/hour.)   This is still not enough to be a lifetime wage.  Also,    <br />most minimum wage jobs are not full time or continuous employment, so    <br />the effective income from minimum wage employment is closer to welfare    <br />rates.</p>
<p>Canadians are being exhorted to live responsibly, only bearing   <br />children if they can afford to raise them, saving for their education    <br />and also for the their own retirement.  The smallest sufficient income    <br />to accomplish this seems to be about double current minimum wages, or    <br />about $20/hour in Manitoba, $35,000 to $45,000 per year averaged over    <br />a working life.</p>
<p>Business won’t pay such wages if they aren’t forced to.  But somebody   <br />must.  Why?  Not for moral reasons, we’re not dealing with morality    <br />here, just practicality.  Whatever way you try to jig the numbers,    <br />half the population depends on the other half just to live.  In a    <br />nation, these life-stages overlap so the burden levels out over time,    <br />but effectively one half is always supporting the other.<br />Paying out to each worker less than double the bare cost of living in   <br />a closed system will result in collapse or shrinkage of the system.<br />But suppose you don’t treat your nation as a closed system?  Maybe you   <br />can outsource some of the cost at the two “nonproductive” ends of the    <br />lifespan.  If you want to cut your costs to the bone so your workers    <br />can be paid only their immediate costs of living, you have to tackle    <br />the problem at the child end and the senior end.</p>
<p>At the child end, you can outsource the production of new workers to   <br />other, poorer countries – i.e. depend on immigration for population    <br />growth.  That’s one thing Canada is doing.</p>
<p>StatsCan tells us “In 2006, international migration accounted for   <br />two-thirds of Canadian population growth… in the mid-1990s, a reversal    <br />occurred: the migratory component became the main engine of Canadian    <br />growth, particularly because of low fertility and the aging of the    <br />population… Around 2030, deaths are expected to start outnumbering    <br />births. From that point forward, immigration would be the only growth    <br />factor for the Canadian population…”</p>
<p>In Canada in 2010, of the 280,000 immigrants, 60% were “economic”   <br />(adults ready to work.)  Another 28% were classed as “family.” The    <br />hard lifting of childbirth and childrearing and child mortality was    <br />done by other countries with no cost to Canada. In fact, immigrants    <br />pay a small but significant landing fee, $500 to $1000 depending on    <br />entry class.   We further maximized the value of the outsourced new    <br />citizens by selecting capable applicants free of serious medical    <br />problems.</p>
<p>At the senior end of the lifespan, you can cut elder supports as much   <br />as possible.  This is harder to do because elders are aware of the    <br />process and often have younger relatives to advocate for them, but    <br />though it’s going slowly, it is a work in progress.<br />A maximally efficient economy in a non-closed system would be one   <br />where you import all your workers, keep them as long as you need them,    <br />and repatriate them afterwards.  But that is not a nation.  Nations    <br />grow their own people, they don’t rent them.</p>
<p>Canada-the-nation may not need to support home-grown population   <br />growth, because we are a nation that encourages many cultures.   The    <br />fact that our immigration policy skims good citizens from poorer    <br />nations doesn’t bother anyone except, I suppose, the poorer nations.    <br />But Canada-the-nation must support seniors.  Business won’t pay enough    <br />in wages for workers to save money for retirement, and for many people    <br />saving or investing isn’t a reliable strategy.  Private business    <br />pensions are becoming quaint luxuries (unless you’re in the government    <br />or you’re a CEO.)</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on being a secure, stable nation.  The chaotic,   <br />competitive and short term business community won’t and probably can’t    <br />supply that stability; only a government has the ability over    <br />generations to ensure stability.</p>
<p>A centralized, national fixed-benefit pension, solid and boring and   <br />guaranteed by the government, is the only practical approach for most    <br />Canadians.  Additional savings are fine, for people who can afford    <br />them, but millions cannot.  Cutting and privatizing senior supports    <br />(Canadian Pension Plan, Old Age Security, and for the very poorest,    <br />the Guaranteed Income Supplement) is the opposite of what    <br />Canada-the-nation needs to be doing.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />(This was written in the Canadian context, where our right-wing prime   <br />minister is in the fast lane to transform Canada to conform more    <br />closely to US antisocial policy.)</p>

<p><strong>I Still Don’t Get Why the ECB Hiked Rates</strong></p>
<p>I still don’t get why the <a href="http://www.ecb.int/stats/monetary/rates/html/index.en.html">ECB hiked rates </a>in April and July of 2011. <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2011/08/malicious-ecb-rate-hikes.html">I questioned this </a>using bond market pricing back in August 2011. Now I question it once more using the ex post trajectory of mortgage rates.</p>
<p>Across the Euro area, 43% of total home loans are made on a variable rate basis – this means that mortgage rates are highly elastic to ECB rate setting policy.<br />Average mortgage rates started rising well before the ECB actually hiked rates. The bottom in mortgage rates was seen in June 2010 and hit a local peak in August 2011 when rate cut expectations started to pass through. But the high correlation between ECB policy and average mortgage rates was to be expected and very harmful to those economies with a rising household desire to save.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/rates_vs_policy_chart3.jpg"><img alt="" height="550" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/rates_vs_policy_chart3.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />It would be one thing if the variable mortgages were concentrated in the core countries; but they’re not. The Periphery economies drive up the average share of variable rate mortgages. In the most extreme case, Portugal, 99% of all home loans are made at a variable interest rate. It doesn’t take a PhD to figure out the speed at which tighter monetary policy will pass through to the real economy when 99% of all loans are made at a variable rate.</p>

<p>Like I said, I still don’t get why the ECB hiked rates.<br />Source data: ECB for <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pdf/mfi/mir1202.pdf">current rate data</a>, and <a href="http://www.ecb.int/pub/pdf/other/housingfinanceeuroarea0309en.pdf">an ECB structural issues report</a> on EA housing for the variable rate shares.</p>

<p>***The Norris quote above begins:<br />
<blockquote>We believe that the correction must come about through reduced production, reduced inventories, the gradual reduction of consumer credit, the liquidation of security loans, and the accumulation of savings through the exercise of thrift. These are slow and simple remedies, but just as there is no &#8220;royal road to knowledge,&#8221; we believe there is no short cut or panacea for the rectification of existing conditions.</p></blockquote>
