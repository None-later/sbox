<p>U.S. Chamber and corporations fighting for low preferential capital gains rates</p>
<p>  A coalition of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and large multinational corporations such as Altria Group Inc. and Excel Energy Inc. is trying to pressure Congress to retain the extraordinarily low current tax rates on unearned income that will expire at the end of 2012 without action. </p>
<p>The alliance sponsored a report by Robert Carroll and Gerald Prante of Ernst &#038; Young that develops the idea of an &#8220;integrated tax rate on dividends&#8221; that includes the taxes paid by the dividend-paying corporation, the federal income taxes paid by the recipient, and the state taxes paid by the recipient. See Carroll &#038; Prante, <a href="http://www.theasi.org/assets/EY_ASI_Dividend_and_Capital_Gains_International_Comparison_Report_2012-02-03.pdf">Corporate Dividend and Capital Gains Taxation: A Comparison of the United States to other developed nations </a>(Feb. 9, 2012), Higher <a href="http://www.theasi.org/in-the-news/new-study.html">Capital Gains and Dividend Taxes Would Put U.S. Further Behind International Competitors</a>, Alliance press release (Feb. 9, 2012); Richard Rubin, <a href="http://www.theasi.org/in-the-news/corporate-coalition-says-obama-investement-taxes-near-world-high.html">Corporate Coalition Says Obama investment taxes Near World High</a>, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 9, 2012)(republished on the Alliance website). The report claims that the U.S. has an &#8220;integrated&#8221; rate of 50.8%. The report claims that such a rate &#8220;discourages capital investment, particularly in the corporate sector, reducing capital formation and, ultimately, living standards.&#8221; Richard Rubin, Corporate Coalition Says Obama Investment Taxes Near World High, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 9, 2012).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Robert Carroll is a former Bush administration official who regularly presents on behalf of corporatism&#8217;s Holy Grail of lower corporate taxes, lower dividend rates, and/or change to a territorial tax system for U.S. corporations. See, e.g., <a href="http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/CTP_Territorial_Article_02Jan2012/%24FILE/CTP_Territorial_Article_02Jan2012.pdf">Charting a Course for Tax Reform&#8211;Moving the U.S. Towards a Territorial Tax System</a> (Jan. 2012); <a href="http://vatinfo.org/2011/07/carroll-robert-ernst-young-llcs-center-for-tax-policy-considerations-for-a-value-added-tax-in-the-united-states-testimony-before-the-ways-and-means-committee-july-26-2011/">Considerations for a Value-Added Tax </a>(July 26, 2011) (arguing that a VAT-type consumption tax could permit lowering corporate tax rates). Carroll&#8217;s VAT article makes the same argument as here&#8211;that taxes hurt investment and therefore jobs.<br />
<blockquote>Greater reliance on value-added taxes, or other consumption-type taxes, to fund government can help improve economic performance because consumption taxes do not tax the return to saving and investment. By not taxing the return to saving and investment, these taxes reduce the cost of capital and lead to greater investment. Greater investment means more capital formation, and, ultimately, higher labor productivity and living standards than otherwise. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>But these arguments ignore the distributional impact of shifting taxes from corporations and wealthy stock traders to everyday Americans who make 30,000 or 50,000 or 75,000. The drive by the GOP and big corporations to save the wealthy from paying much in taxes shows no concern at all for the fact that the tax burden would be shifted to low-income Americans. <br />Not surprisingly, the tax rate analysis in this &#8220;for hire&#8221; E&#038;Y report is highly misleading. Let&#8217;s note the reasons, yet again.
<ul>
<li>The report assumes that shareholders bear the full brunt of the corporate income tax. Yet there is no conclusive evidence about the incidence of corporate tax. Many shareholders such as pension funds are tax exempt and pay no tax on the corporate dividends. </li>
<li>The report assumes that corporate income is taxed at the federal statutory rate of 35%, whereas in reality the vast majority of corporations pay zero federal income tax and those that pay tax pay an average around 24% effective tax rate (with many lower). Aggressive tax planning, cross-border tax credits, and various deductions (including greatly accelerated depreciation and expensing compared to actual economic wear and tear) allow corporations to reduce their tax liabilities much below the nominal statutory rate. While a chart on page 4 (showing a $100 income amount suffering the 35% corporate rate, an average state corporate rate, a 15% shareholder federal tax and a 4% assumed average shareholder state tax) indicates this is the &#8220;top&#8221; rate, most of the report discusses this &#8220;integrated&#8221; rate as though it were the actual rate paid. </li>
<li>The report disregards the fact that capital gains are also earned outside of corporations (as Dan Shaviro noted in the Bloomberg piece). It suggests that the corporate level tax will impact &#8220;each worker&#8221;:</li>
</ul>
<p>With less capital available for each worker to work with, labor productivity is lowered, which reduces the wages of workers, and ultimately, Americans’ standard of living. Report at 5.<br />Yet much of the work done in this country is not done for major corporations. There are partnerships and S corporations and sole proprietorships all operating businesses and providing capital gains in appropriate contexts. (And of course most of the capital gains that are being taxed aren&#8217;t earned from money that was invested in corporations but rather from corporate stock bought in the secondary market. All this talk about capital for workers is irrelevant to those secondary market trades. See this point below.)
<ul>
<li>The conclusions disregard the fact that investors can defer taxation of capital gains indefinitely by choosing when to sell, and that many gains are never taxed at all over multiple generations, since heirs receive corporate stock (and other assets) with a step-up in basis. (Text accompanying footnote 5 merely mentions that the effective rate &#8220;might&#8221; be lowered by this fact; the footnote notes that &#8220;common practice&#8221; for determining the impact would give an integrated tax rate of 43.1%.) </li>
<li>Chuck Marr, at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, also indicated that &#8220;the report also ignores the total tax burden around the world. In 2009, U.S. tax revenue of 24.1 percent of gross domestic product was 9.7 percentage points below the unweighted average of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.&#8221; As a result, &#8220;the United States is actually a very low-tax country compared to all these other countries.&#8221; Richard Rubin, Corporate Coalition Says Obama Investment Taxes Near World High, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 9, 2012). </li>
<li>The report purportedly compares top integrated tax rates among the developed countries. But does it really include all the relevant taxes for other countries? It is not clear that the VAT, for example, has been included in countries where a VAT is a significant addition to regular income taxes: the report mentions only corporate income tax rates and dividend tax rates in discussing other countries&#8217; &#8220;integrated&#8221; rates. </li>
<li>The report ignores the fact that there is at best a very slim correlation between the transfer of funds to a business entity for use in running the business and capital gains taxation. Most corporate stock is purchased in the secondary markets, not at IPOs. Most of the gains that are taxed are therefore just accretions in value as corporate stock changes hands from one investor to another. There is no benefit of capital formation for the corporation from the trade&#8211;the money goes into the pockets of the one who sells, possibly to be reinvested offshore in an emerging market economy or to purchase the stock of another U.S. MNE. </li>
<li>The report assumes that half of any increase in dividend taxes is absorbed into share value but the other half &#8220;influences investment decisions&#8221;. n.12. This is one of those &#8220;anything goes&#8221; assumptions that is so annoying about supposedly empirical work that tries to &#8220;predict&#8221; how behavior will be affected by taxes. </li>
<li>The report discusses a &#8220;marginal effective tax rate&#8221; and suggests that corporate capital will be reduced by that rate, resulting in less expansion and less job creation. But that rate as shown here includes the statutory tax rate on the corporation&#8217;s profits and the shareholders&#8217; tax rate on its unearned income from holding corporate stock. Even if one thought that using the statutory rate to discuss corporate tax burdens was reasonable (which I do not), this mingled rate is not the relevant rate that the corporation would consider in determining whether it was profitable and could expand and add on workers or jobs. The corporation may retain its profits and use them to expand or provide working capital, and not pay dividends to shareholders. Many corporations have in fact foregone dividends and instead invested in share buybacks, which give a perceived benefit from reducing the total number of outstanding shares. Interestingly, while the report uses this mingled rate to argue that taxes are bad because it will keep corporations from investing and hiring (pp5-6), it also argues that taxes on unearned income of shareholders from corporations will mean corporations will retain those earnings and &#8220;overinvest&#8221; in the corporation (p7). Talk about trying to have your pie and eat it too. </li>
<li>The argument that fungible investor capital will necessarily flee the country if capital gains rates are allowed to go back to at least the level they were under Clinton, as GOP representative Peter Roskam from Illinois suggests, id., simply misundersands what drives investment decisions and the way our tax system works. </li>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Many other factors drive investors to purchase stock, whether in IPOs or in the secondary market, including the stability of a country&#8217;s markets, the vigorousness of economic growth, the price-earnings ratios of corporate stocks, the economic outlook for particular industrial sectors, etc. </li>
<li>Americans are taxed on their worldwide income, so they don&#8217;t avoid the US tax on capital gains unless they expatriate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Taxes are just one factor, and in fact corporate stocks traded quite well when capital gains taxes and dividends taxes were much higher than they are now. Many experts think that removing the preferential rate for capital gains would be the most reasonable way to level the playing field for workers and managers/owners, while raising billions to offset the federal deficit. </li>
<li>The distributional effects of very low capital gains tax rates are detrimental. Most of those who benefit from the preferential capital gains are the wealthy who own most of the financial assets, with about 2/3 of the benefit going to millionaires, according to the Tax Policy Center. Id.</li>
</ul>
<p>Taxes on earned income&#8211;salary and wages&#8211;are graduated, rising to a maximum of 35% for top income earners. Taxes on unearned income, such as dividends from qualifying corporations or gains from sales of corporate shares, are only 15%. This significant disparity in rates (35% compared to 15%) means that the wealthy who own most of the financial assets and have most of the capital gain income enjoy an extraordinarily preferential tax rate. The result is that wealthy individuals like Mitt Romney can end up paying a significantly lower tax rate than construction workers, firefighters and schoolteachers. That&#8217;s unreasonable: the nation would be better served by eliminating the capital gains preference and using those funds to rebuild public infrastructure.</p>

<blockquote><p>Estimates of potential GDP are not simple extrapolations of actual GDP from the peak of the last business cycles. They are estimates of the maximum sustainable output given fully employed resources.  The backbone of the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/30xx/doc3020/PotentialOutput.pdf">CBO&#8217;s estimates is a Solow Growth model</a>.  So I don&#8217;t think that <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/jim-bullard-chucks-solow-growth-model.html">Noah Smith is quite accurate when he says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, basically, what we have here is Bullard saying that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_growth_model">neoclassical (Solow) growth model</a> &#8211; and all models like it &#8211; are wrong. He&#8217;s saying that a change in asset prices can cause a permanent change in the equilibrium capital/labor ratio. </p></blockquote>
<p>Bullard can&#8217;t be saying the Solow growth model is wrong because he doesn&#8217;t realize that such a model is the basis for the estimates he is criticizing. [first and last link in the original; Noah Smith link copied from elsewhere in the original post]</p></blockquote>
<p>Go <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/2012/02/its-worse-than-you-think.html">Read the Whole Thing</a>.  For those of you too lazy to do that without incentive, here&#8217;s the conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>Bottom Line:  Bullard really went down an intellectual dead end last week.  He criticized the focus on potential output, but revealed that he doesn&#8217;t really understand the concept of potential output either empirically or theoretically.  He then compounds that error by arguing against the current stance of monetary policy, but fails to provide an alternative policy path.  And the presumed policy path, tighter policy, looks likely to only worsen the distortions he argues the Fed is creating.  I just don&#8217;t see where Bullard thinks he is taking us.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Bruce Wilder had an excellent <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2011/09/06/neo-liberalism-again/#comment-377147">comment</a> recently in the Crooked Timber thread on markets, economic rents, and the constraints on economic actors, excerpted by Dan <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/02/discussion-at-crooked-timber-on-what.html">here</a>, and more with comments by Jazzbumpah <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/02/more-on-markets-and-neoliberalism-from.html">here</a>.

<p>The emphasis on constraints prompts me to revisit a <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/?p=313">post</a> I made a few years back, pointing out that constraints, not innovation, are the shaping forces of economies:</p>
<p><strong>Lane Kenworthy’s Big Idea</strong><br /><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/02/age-of-milton-friedman.html">Attributing</a> the robust state of modern economies to the “free” market is like saying that Arabian stallions, champion Rottweilers, and freshly-picked sweet corn are the result of mutation.</p>

<p>That’s the thought I come away with after reading <a href="http://lanekenworthy.net/" title="Consider the Evidence">Lane Kenworthy</a>’s chapter on “The Efficiency of Constraints” in his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Search-National-Economic-Success-Competition/dp/0803971605/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1204398077&#038;sr=8-1"><em>In Search of National Economic Success: Balancing Competition and Cooperation</em></a> (1995).</p>
<p>After quoting Smith’s seminal “invisible hand” passage, Kenworthy says (emphasis mine):<br />
<blockquote><strong>The reason actors engage in economically beneficial behavior</strong>, according to the [neoclassical] theory, is not that they have unlimited freedom of choice, but that <strong>they must choose within a particular set of constraints </strong>– the constraints imposed by market competition. … <strong>It is this constraint</strong>, rather than freedom of choice, <strong>that is the crucial efficiency-generating mechanism</strong> in a capitalist economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, extolling the “free” part of free markets is <strong>like getting all drippy about mutation without selection</strong>. More Kenworthy:</p>
<blockquote><p>The issue is not free choice versus constraints, but what type of constraints produce economically productive activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Natural selection — in this case the constraints imposed by the natural and human environment and by other free-market agents — is a powerful force. But Kenworthy asks, quite reasonably, whether it is always more efficiency-producing than artificial selection (a.k.a. human-directed selection, a.k.a….breeding). In many cases, the visible hand of government creates more efficient markets.</p>
<p>Free-market advocates tend to ignore the reality that market-generated constraints often act directly against the formation of efficient markets. To choose what is perhaps the most obvious example: competition creates huge incentives for market participants to make sure that all information <em>is not</em> known. Disclosure regulations address that inefficiency, and result in the kind of robust open markets we see today in prosperous countries. Kenworthy gives three more (detailed and well-analyzed) examples in his chapter.</p>
<p>Even Adam Smith doesn’t assert that market constraints have some <em>a priori</em> claim to superiority. Says Kenworthy, quoting Smith,</p>
<blockquote><p>…an individual who “intends only his own gain” is “led by an invsible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention. <strong>Nor is it always the worse for the society</strong> that it was no part of it. By pursuing his own interest <strong>he frequently promotes </strong>that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>“Nor is it always.” “Frequently.” Cherry-picked, at least, it verges on a mealy-mouthed endorsement. Smith, in his wisdom, is not nearly so categorical as his latter-day disciples.</p>
<p>Kenworthy’s attention to constraints — market-imposed and otherwise — strikes me as a profound insight, cutting straight to the heart of the <em>laissez faire</em> philosophy of neoclassical economics. But the idea — at least in this form — has not been taken up much by mainstream economists. A notable exception is Kenworthy’s colleague Wolfgang Streeck (who Kenworthy credits with inspiring his chapter in the first place).*</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Kenworthy has a lot more than one good idea. <em>National Economic Success</em> has a boatload. Ditto his latest, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Egalitarian-Capitalism-Incomes-Affluent-Countries/dp/0871544520"><em>Egalitarian Capitalism: Jobs, Income and Growth in Affluent Countries</em></a> (2007). This post is already altogether too long, so I’ll leave it to other posts — and other posters — to delve into those ideas.</p>

<p><strong>The 1% are the only beneficiaries of Greek austerity, not ordinary Greeks</strong></p>
<p>  An interesting post over on Naked Capitalism on the Greek austerity measures being demanded by the EU leaders (Germany, mostly) and the IMF: <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2012/02/marshall-auerback-greece-and-the-rape-by-the-rentiers.html">Marshal Auerback: Greece and the Rape by the Rentiers </a>(Feb. 10, 2012).</p>
<p>The austerity demands, in order for a sovereign nation to pay back its debt to mostly big banks that lent money recklessly in the leadup to the financial crisis, make no sense at all. If you impose austerity, you clamp down on the economy. If you clamp down on the economy, the poor and near-poor who are already struggling will struggle even more. Unemployment will increase. Desperation will set in and crime or revolution will follow. The 1% at the top do okay at least for a while&#8211;after all, they&#8217;ve been hogging all the good stuff for a decade at least, and many of them (if the scofflaw wealthy in this country are any guide) will have sequestered funds away in hidden offshore bank accounts to bide them through the rough times or even support them if they expatriate to avoid the mayhem.   When austerity measures include privatization of public assets, that same top 1% is able to acquire very valuable assets for a song and then charge &#8220;rentier&#8221; rewards for the public to use their own assets.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />That&#8217;s the story that Auerbach tells for Greece, as he wonders why they don&#8217;t just get the hell out of the Euro zone and go back to their own currency. They probably will default anyway. But they will have paid a high price for trying to avoid default&#8211;the huge cut in wages, increase in unemployment and suffering going on now, and the privatization of even more of their public goods. Greece plans to sell six national companies&#8211;energy companies and refineries are included. The banks must be shitting in their pants in excitement.  </p>

<p>Rent Control, Redux</p>
<p> There&#8217;s been a small dustup on rent control lately on the blogosphere.   Peter Dorman has been pointing out <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/02/little-more-on-rent-control.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+espeak+%28EconoSpeak%29">that the theory everyone knows may not fit the facts</a>.   I myself covered the topic before <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/look-at-incredibly-silly-story.html">here</a>.  Its worth a read, I think, but here&#8217;s the takeaway   <br />
<blockquote>Now, I haven&#8217;t been in NYC in decades, but I do know this. After a few decades, there&#8217;s time for a market to adjust. If it doesn&#8217;t pay to be a landlord, expect fewer people to want to be landlords – the supply of dwellings for rent relative to dwellings for sale will dwindle. If it doesn&#8217;t pay to be a renter, expect fewer people to want to be renters – the demand for dwellings for rent relative to dwellings for sale will dwindle. Either way, if rent control &#8220;ruined New York City real estate markets&#8221; and has been doing so since 1943, one thing we should expect is that the percent of occupied housing units that are owner-occupied (as opposed to renter occupied) in NYC is much higher than in places where the real estate markets were not ruined by rent control.</p></blockquote>
<p>Following a look at the data:   <br />
<blockquote>Put another way, in NYC, where generations of rent control has destroyed the rental market, two thirds of all occupied dwellings are rentals. In the rest of the US, two thirds of all occupied dwellings are not rentals. By the numbers, it seems the rental market is extremely healthy in NYC relative to the rest of the country. And BTW… the bottom three slots of the national ranking of states and the District of Columbia, the three locations with the lowest percentage of owner occupied housing as a percentage of total occupied housing, were taken up by the Washington DC, New York, and California. It just so happens that when I hear people talk about how rent control has destroyed a market, driving out landlords and renters alike, the story is usually about DC, NYC, or San Francisco. Funny, huh?   </p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Two more points… fourth from the bottom of the list, right above California, is Hawaii, while at the other end (i.e., at the top of the list) we find we find Minnesota, West Virginia, Michigan and New Hampshire. Also, if you work your way through the data, you&#8217;ll find that big cities like Boston, LA and Houston all tend to have relatively low homeownership rates. I&#8217;m guessing anyone whose mouth isn&#8217;t automatically programmed to say &#8220;rent control&#8221; can noodle out for him/herself exactly what is going on here. </p></blockquote>
<p>The saddest thing about the economics profession today is not the number of economists who believe things that make little sense and who refuse to look at data that is so readily available.  The saddest thing, frankly, is that the fairy tales told in the profession make their way out into the real world and affect real decisions.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <div>A good friend and I got into an email debate.  He sent me the latest message regarding how wonderful it is that Florida is going to be drug testing welfare recipients.  I responded that I&#8217;ll consider the policy when we start testing all the CEO&#8217;s who get welfare for their sector of the economy, the lawyers, judges and all country club members.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I also noted welfare is not the problem  He noted it&#8217;s not “the” problem, but it is “a” problem and he knows this from talking to people.  I know of welfare too.  I have served on two nonprofit boards, one for substance abuse and the other The Providence Center.  My family adopted a family when I was in junior high.  We had foster children.  I was a day counselor for 2 weeks in the summer of &#8217;73 for 7 to 12 year olds from 3 of the most horrible housing developments in the city of Providence.  We had the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchman_Institute">“Institute”</a> literally right around the corner from where I lived.  My daughter is doing a year with <a href="http://www.nw.org/network/index.asp">NeighborWorks America</a>.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Welfare is not the problem.  But, my friend is a very smart person and an engineer, so I needed some numbers.  Using <a href="http://www.usgovernmentdebt.us/year_spending_2008USbn_13bs1n_40#usgs302">this site</a> I checked out what the ratio of spending on Family and Children and Housing is to our GDP. I used GDP and not the overall budget because hey, we all worked to earn that money and it might as well be used for something that is heart warming.  The following numbers are total national spending (Fed, State, Local).</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The year 1962 is the first year that there is spending listed for both Family and Children and Housing.  Prior to that only Housing is listed as having spending. For 1962, the combined total ratio was 0.0027.  That is 0.27% of our GDP was spend on families, children and housing.  I started with 1970 and went forward using the endings of the presidential terms starting with 1980.</div>
<div>1970:   0.0035</div>
<div>1980:   0.0092</div>
<div>1988:   0.0093</div>
<div>1992:   0.0134</div>
<div>2000:   0.0092</div>
<div>2008:   0.0097</div>
<div>2010:   0.0141</div>
<div></div>
<div>First of all, these are miniscule percentages of our GDP.  Second, it sure looks to me like the best way to solve the “welfare problem” is to solve the economic problem.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course, this means nothing if we don&#8217;t have other government spending patterns to compare too.  I mean, how do we know if welfare is “out of control” if we can&#8217;t compare it to other spending?  The same data set has two other categories: General Government and Other Spending.  You can click on each to see the sub categories.  But, just so you know General Government consists of Executive and Legislative organ, Financial and General services.  Other does not include: Pensions, Education, Health, Defense, Protection, Transportation or interest.  Other is just that: Other.  Here is how the numbers look.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P_hSs7IusGU/TziVaARYHFI/AAAAAAAAAR4/OaEyKcOa2n0/s1600/Welfare+chart+post+2-12-12.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P_hSs7IusGU/TziVaARYHFI/AAAAAAAAAR4/OaEyKcOa2n0/s320/Welfare+chart+post+2-12-12.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>  </div>
<div>This is how the numbers flow as log function.</div>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q_Ww0EO90A8/TziVdkLMeTI/AAAAAAAAASA/vycHbhD4Ud0/s1600/Welfare+graph+post+2-12-12.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="245" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q_Ww0EO90A8/TziVdkLMeTI/AAAAAAAAASA/vycHbhD4Ud0/s320/Welfare+graph+post+2-12-12.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div></div>
<p>  
<div>Call me stupid, but it looks to me like what we spend on welfare is not much more than what the  government is spending on just doing the government thingy, unless of course people can&#8217;t get a job.  Interestingly enough, the share of GDP spent on welfare in 1992 and 2010 is the same.  In fact, at the peak of unemployment of the 2001 recession which was 2003, we spent just 0.0098 on welfare.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is another comparison.  In 2009 we spent $167 billion on Family/Children and Housing.  That year, we also spent $161 billion in the Other category of “Economic Affairs”.  I don&#8217;t know what that is, but if it has anything to do with what we are experiencing I don&#8217;t think we got our money&#8217;s worth.  This item went from -7.0 in 1997 to 7.8 in 2002 to 17.5 in 2005 to 1.3 in 2007 back to 17.7 in 2008.  It landed at -79.7 in 2010.  Hummmmmmmmm.  I think Glen Beck would like this category.  You know, who&#8217;s been playing with the money in the cookie jar?  In fact, why did we not know that a cookie jar exists?  </div>
<div></div>
<div>It doesn&#8217;t make me feel good to think that we spend about as much on the top office operations of this country as we spend on helping people.  Think about it.  What percentage of the “welfare problem” do</div>
<div></div>
<div>you believe is a problem? You know those drug addled lazy moochers who are preventing all us moral and hardworking folks from living the good life of our congress persons.  Be careful now.  This is a trick question.  See, it won&#8217;t take much of a “problem” subtracted from what we spend to find ourselves spending less to take care of families and their children than we spend on the top office operations in this nation.  That&#8217;s just plain being cheap.  Down right, out and out cheap SOB&#8217;s even if we leave in all of the &#8220;problem&#8221;.     </div>

<blockquote>Actual markets in the American economy are extremely rare and unusual  beasts.  <i>An economics of markets ought to be regarded as generally  useful as a biology of cephalopods, amid the living world of bones and  shells</i>.  But, somehow the idealized, metaphoric market is substituted as  an analytic mask, laid across a vast variety of economic relations and  relationships, obscuring every important feature of what actually is.   And, then we wonder why the “thinking” and policy debates that result  are stupid and corrupt.<br />&#8212;  <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2011/09/26/colin-crouch-the-strange-non-death-of-neo-liberalism/#comment-379317">Bruce Wilder </a></p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis added.   This is in the context of a critique of neoloberalism, here described by <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2011/09/26/colin-crouch-the-strange-non-death-of-neo-liberalism/#comment-379312">Henry Farrell</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In fact, it is not free markets with vigorous competition among  producers, but instead, a mixture of big firm oligopoly and cosy and  frequently corrupt relationships between state officials, who have been  told to subcontract out parts of government, and the businesses which  supply these new services, in what is at best a murky approximation to a  real marketplace. You can read this as a statement that classical  liberalism has some good points as well as some bad ones. You can  equally well read it as saying (and this is the more fundamental point),  that regardless of whether or not classical realism had some good  arguments, these don’t have anything much to do with  actually-existing-neoliberalism which is a crony capitalist fantasy.</p></blockquote>
<p>This  lays bare the greed, dishonesty, corruption and manipulation inherent  to neoliberalism, and simultaneously exposes the concept of &#8220;the market&#8221;  as an absurd quirk of the typical economist&#8217;s imagination.</p>
<p>Each  of these meaty comments is highly worthy of recognition.  The  cephalopod reference made the first one utterly irresistible, and prompted this post.</p>
<p>The bad news is that there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any way out.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Here, <a href="http://johnquiggin.com/2008/09/27/neoliberalism-defined/">John Quiggin provides</a> a good functional definition of neolibealism &#8211; the first I&#8217;ve ever seen  &#8211; and a very thoughtful critique of neoliberalism as a political cum  economic ideology.</p>
<blockquote><p>The core of the neoliberal program is<br />(i) to remove the state altogether from ‘non-core’ functions such as the provision of infrastructure services<br />(ii) to minimise the state role in core functions (health, education,  income security) through contracting out, voucher schemes and so on<br />(iii) to reject redistribution of income except insofar as it is implied by the provision of a basic ‘safety net’.</p></blockquote>
<p>Quiggin  judges neoliberaism to be a failure, for different reasons in different  places.  I&#8217;m going to quibble with his definition of failure, type iii,  though: <i>a failure to deliver the promised outcomes</i>.  With  a focus in the inherent dishonesty and corruption inherent to  neoliberalism, I can only view it as highly successful in the U.S.  This  is because there is a real hidden agenda lurking behind the false  public agenda.<br />  <br />Wilder describes how it works in a <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2011/09/26/colin-crouch-the-strange-non-death-of-neo-liberalism/#comment-379361">follow-up comment</a>: (Be sure to read the whole thing.)</p>
<blockquote><p>Neoliberalism, it seems to me, uses the myth of the market, to  rationalize rule-making, which serves the rentiers (is dynamically  inefficient) and which promotes authoritarian, and therefore unfair,  resolution of conflict.</p></blockquote>
<p>Quiggin describes the type iii failure in the U.S:  &#8220;<i>The basic problem is that, given high levels of inequality, very strong  economic performance is required to match the levels of economic  security and social services delivered under social democracy even with  mediocre growth outcomes.</i>&#8221;  Of course, no such strong economic  performance is forthcoming.</p>
<p>However, the real agenda is not general  economic security.  Quite to the contrary, it is to maximize and  maintain a high level of inequality, such that the small, elite minority  has absolute control over the impoverished majority, precisely because  their economic security is severely limited.  I cite as evidence the  extreme form of 21st Century Republican party neoliberalism, which even attacks the  existence of a basic safety net.  Note also their ongoing attacks  against labor unions, health care reform, and education at all levels.</p>
<p>The job is not yet complete, but I have to view the record of neoliberalism in the U.S., to date, as a smashing success.</p>
<p>I posted this on my blog in slightly different form as a <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2012/02/quotes-of-day-markets.html">Quote of the Day</a> entry.  But it makes such a fitting companion piece to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/02/discussion-at-crooked-timber-on-what.html">Dan&#8217;s from earlier today</a> that I decided to put it up here, as well.</p>

<p>Lifted from comments at <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2845094/posts" target="_blank">Free Republic</a> website regarding Newt&#8217;s speech at CPAC earlier this week (and a spirited debate of advocates for Santorum and Romney) comes this note from a Newt admirer regarding Newt&#8217;s downsizing the &#8216;federal government&#8217; in the 1990&#8217;s (and to his credit linked appropriately).  He uses one of Mike&#8217;s early charts on executive branch civilian employment measures of compararing Presidents:  <br />
<blockquote>To: American Constitutionalist  </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>Chart of federal civilian employees&#8230;big decline under the Newtster, even while the economy was booming. The decline leveled off post-Newtster. We can see the Carter/Bush eras saw declines in their recessions but Newt kept it going in good economic times.  </div>

<p>I am not proposing cosmic signigicance here, but a scratch of the head and a &#8216;WTF&#8217;.   As a leftie I suppose the conclusion could be that President Clinton found Newt&#8217;s tenure as Speaker so less than challenging he decided that he didn&#8217;t need the staff.  Aside from all the other business.  Thanks Ken for the idea.   🙂</p>

<blockquote>Outside groups are spending nearly 1,300 percent more on broadcast advertising for the 2012 election than they did in 2008, according to an <a href="http://mediaproject.wesleyan.edu/2012/01/30/group-involvement-skyrockets/">analysis</a> released on Jan. 30. This is the clearest demonstration yet that <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-205.ZS.html"><i>Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission</i></a> has fundamentally rewritten the rules for political spending.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />The Jan. 31 disclosure reports filed by independent expenditure-only political action committees – typically referred to as “super PACs” – contained few surprises: super PACs have been raising, and spending, dizzying amounts of money in an attempt to influence the 2012 elections. In fact, these more than 300 &#8220;independent&#8221; (that is, &#8220;not coordinated&#8221; with a candidate or political party) groups have accounted for more than 40 percent of all the broadcast ads aired during the Republican presidential primaries, as compared to only three percent of the 2008 ads.</p>
<p>While candidates are vying to attract the support of a broad swath of voters, the super PACs endorsing them are funded almost entirely by very few, very wealthy donors. For example, more than 80 percent of the $17.9 million dollars collected by the super PAC supporting (but not connected to or coordinated with) Mitt Romney&#8217;s campaign came via six-figure contributions. Five other super PACs supporting Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, Rick Santorum, Rick Perry, and Jon Huntsman <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/02/the_100k_club_presidential_super_pacs_almost_entirely_funded_by_six_figure_contributions.php?ref=fpblg">showed a similar pattern</a>. Winning Our Future, a pro-Gingrich super PAC, received $10 million from just one couple.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Well, sort of on markets.<br />There is an interesting conversation going on at <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2011/09/06/neo-liberalism-again">Crooked Timber</a> our public debate in the econosphere and political rhetoric .   Henry posts on the use of arguments over the term neo-liberalism and finishes with:</p>
<blockquote><p>For what it’s worth, I think that the open information agenda, and the political inequality agenda have a lot more in common than most people think (I have been planning for some time to do more writing on this over the next year). I think it would be a lot more useful to frame the argument as one between different ways of restructuring markets so as to tackle problems of inequality at their source than as one between neo-liberalism and its critics</p></blockquote>
<p>Lifted from comments,  <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Bruce Wilder</a> offers this observation:</p>
<dd>To a large extent, we are all intellectual victims of economists, dead and otherwise, who really do not know what they are talking about. The main problem with the standard analysis of the “market economy”, as well as many variants, is that we do not live in a “<i>market</i> economy”. Except for financial markets and a few related commodity markets, markets are rare beasts in the modern economy. The actual economy is dominated by formal, hierarchical, administrative organization and transactions are governed by incomplete contracts, explicit and implied. “Markets” are, at best, metaphors.</dd>
<dd><a name="more"></a><br />The elaborate theory of market price gives us an abstract ideal of <i>allocative</i> efficiency, in the absence of any firm or household behaving strategically (aka perfect competition). In real life, allocative efficiency is far less important than achieving technical efficiency, and, of course, everyone behaves strategically.<br />In a world of genuine uncertainty and limitations to knowledge, incentives in the distribution of income are tied directly to the distribution of risk. Economic rents are pervasive, but potentially beneficial, in that they provide a means of stable structure, around which investments can be made and production processes managed to achieve technical efficiency.<br />In the imaginary world of complete information of Econ 101, where markets are the dominant form of economic organizations, and allocative efficiency is the focus of attention, firms are able to maximize their profits, because they know what “maximum” means. They are unconstrained by anything.<br />In the actual, uncertain world, with limited information and knowledge, only <i>constrained</i> maximization is possible. All firms, instead of being profit-maximizers (not possible in a world of uncertainty), are rent-seekers, responding to instituted constraints: the institutional rules of the game, so to speak. Economic rents are what they have to lose in this game, and protecting those rents, orients their behavior within the institutional constraints. Those constraints are in the nature of a public good, and if that public good is well-provided, the behavior is socially beneficial and technically efficient.<br />It is within this context, that risk and innovation (aka, changing institutional structure) can pay off.<br />So, yes, licensing barbers can make perfect sense. It creates a small economic rent, and if that rent is tied effectively to barbers being scrupulous about safe and healthy technical practice, that’s a economic benefit. The gain is in technical efficiency, not allocative efficiency.</dd>
