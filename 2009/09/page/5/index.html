<p>“Nobody else gets hurt if you buy a lousy mortgage pool,” Cochrane said. “The government doesn’t need to write a new rule every time someone buys a rotten tomato. Investors will demand the right amount of transparency, complexity, and risk-sharing – or monitoring of mortgage pools – unless they all get bailed out and learn to count on a bailout instead.”  &#8212; <a href="http://www.chicagobooth.edu/news/2007-10-08_scholes.aspx">John Cochrane 2007</a></p>
<p>via Matt Yglesias</p>
<p>Now I don&#8217;t plan to obsess about Prof Cochrane, but he does express a widespread view very briefly and clearly here.  I discuss his thoughts after the jump.</p>
<p>Brief and clear before the jump.  Long and rambling after.  Sorry.</p>
<p>in 2 sentences Cochrane made 2 quite different arguments in favor of laissez faire.</p>
<p>1a. Consenting adults should be allowed to do whatever they want so long as they don&#8217;t hurt anyone else <br />1b  Market transactions do not typically cause any externalities (pollution is a special case not relevant here)</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>2.  Market transactions will be Pareto efficient for the contracting parties, because the world must be in Nash equilbibrium or maybe will get there soon as people learn from their mistakes.</p>
<p>1a is implicit.  I agree with 1a.  2 is a common argument (especially at Chicago Business School).  I don&#8217;t agree with 2, but I don&#8217;t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>My point in this post is that 1b is plainly false.  This is an argument which I have made again and again at this blog, and I&#8217;m still trying to get it right.</p>
<p>Market transactions typically (I mean generically, that is, for an open and dense set of economies) cause externalities through prices (pecuniary externalities).  If you buy an apple, I can&#8217;t buy that apple.  I might have wanted to buy it, so your transaction reduces my welfare.  This is obvious and so what.  For the purposes of our beliefs in freedom (statement 1a) it doesn&#8217;t matter, because I don&#8217;t have the exclusive right to the apple.  &#8220;gets hurt&#8221; means something like &#8220;is worse off than he or she would be if the contracting parties didn&#8217;t exist.  My not being able to contract with one of them is for me to lose something which isn&#8217;t mine and isn&#8217;t harm of the sort that justifies bringing in the state.&#8221;</p>
<p>It just isn&#8217;t true that banning or allowing a transaction between agents has no effects on the welfare of other agents. It is true that it doesn&#8217;t &#8220;harm&#8221; them in the legal sense, since the benefits of banning the transaction to the third party are not something to which the third party has a right.</p>
<p>The 2 paragraphs above are blindingly obvious.  However, Cochrane really needs to assume they false.  </p>
<p>The standard result in economic theory which supports laissez faire is the first welfare theorem which states that the free market equilibrium is Pareto efficient, so you can&#8217;t make everyone better off by restricting free market transactions.  The theorem does not say the market outcome is the best possible for everyone, just that interventions will help some people and hurt others.</p>
<p>This happens, because there can&#8217;t be a change in market prices which helps everyone.  Total sales equal total purchases, so the effect of a change in prices on the sum of the wealth of all agents (measured in numeraire good) must be zero.  Some gain and some lose.  The sum of welfare in utils can increase or decrease, but money metric welfare must stay the same, so it can&#8217;t be that everyone is better off.</p>
<p>This is true under the assumptions of the first welfare theorem.  </p>
<p>One key assumption is that there are complete markets so that all conceivable financial assets exist and ar traded.  Clearly it makes no sense to study financial innovation starting with the assumption of complete markets.  The financial sector is assumed.  Different financial possibilities are not allowed.  </p>
<p>Cocrane&#8217;s argument against restrictions on new financial instruments is based on the assumption that markets are complete.  Such an argument makes no possible sense.  If markets were complete, then new financial instruments couldn&#8217;t possibly make any difference (they would be identical to a portfolio of existing instruments).</p>
<p>As proven by Geanakoplos and Polimarchakis, if markets are incomplete, except for somem amazing coincidence, there is a restriction on voluntary transactions of financial instruments whcih makes everyone better off than they would be under laissez faire.</p>
<p>The reason is the pecuniary externalities which I mentioned above.  Trade in financial assets will affect future prices.  Even in the simplest model with financial assets all sold in just one period and which last just one more period, the financial transactions will affect people&#8217;s wealth and that will affect demand for goods unless everyone has identical homothetic preferences (that&#8217;s one of the possible amazing coincidences).  </p>
<p>For each possible outcome, the effect on prices will help some people and hurt others.  The sum of the value of the gains in losses in dollars (or apples or whatever) will be zero.  The sum of the change in happiness in utils will not be zero unless everyone always has the same marginal utility of income (or apples).  </p>
<p>Crucially, chicago economists accept that agents maximize expected utility.  Thus, to them (and to me) an agents interests are described by the sum of happiness in different states times the probability of that state occuring.  </p>
<p>Now restrictions on financial transactions will help some people and hurt others.  There is no result at all that the benefit and harm must add up to zero or that the same people are helped by a restriction or anything like that. </p>
<p>Basically fiddling with purchases and sales of financial assets, a meddling state can fiddle with welfare in many different ways.  Except if these different ways happen by pure coincidence to have exactly proportional effects on agents* the meddling state can manage pretty much any vector it wants with a linear combination of restrictions on transactions.  </p>
<p>*(or something like that &#8212; formally except if by pure coincidence the matrix of changes in welfare has rank lower than it&#8217;s order up untill order equals population) </p>
<p>This means that, except for an amazing coincidence, the state can manage a vector of changes in welfare with all positive elements &#8212; that is a Pareto improvement achieved entirely by meddling with voluntary transactions between free rational agents.</p>
<p>OK so why is the market outcome Pareto efficient if there are complete markets ?  Well the reason is that, if there are complete markets, then the marginal utility of income (or apples) in different states of agent A and of agent B must be proportional.  Otherwise they eould gain from a further transaction.  That the vectors of changes in welfare are exactly proportional is not an amazing coincidence, it is a property of equilibrium with complete markets.</p>
<p>The idea that pecuniary transactions don&#8217;t count is based on two ideas.  First it is a violation of natural liberty to count them and second that, while they help some and hurt others, it balances out some how. </p>
<p>The second argument only makes any sense at all if there are complete markets.  Now since a regulation can make everyone better off, everyone would support the regulation.  That means that enacting it doesn&#8217;t violate anyone&#8217;s liberty.</p>
<p>Bascially there is a very common argument that </p>
<p>1) our approach to the regulation of new financial instruments should be based on economic theory and, in particular, general equilibrium theory<br />2) General equilibrium theory says if and (generically) only if, there is no remaining possibility of profitable introduction of new financial instruments, then the best regulation is no regulation.<br />3) therefore the best regulation of new financial instruments is no regulation. </p>

                                <p>Via the must-read <a target="_blank" href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/">Susan of Texas</a>, Ezra Klein <a target="_blank" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/09/ignoring_innovation.html">finally comes to some of his senses</a>:<br />
<blockquote> couldn&#8217;t get an answer to a very simple question: What level of spending on health care was optimal for innovation? Should we double spending? Triple it? Cut it by 10 percent? Simply give a larger portion of it to drug and device manufacturers? I&#8217;d be interested in a proposal meant to maximize medical innovation. I&#8217;ve not yet seen one.</p>
<p>It turned out that concerns about innovation weren&#8217;t really about innovation at all. They were just about attacking universal health care ideas of a certain sort. Which is why I stopped taking them seriously. As it is, I&#8217;m less worried about squeezing out medical innovation than I am about rising medical costs squeezing out innovation in every other sector of society.</p></blockquote>
<p>The final point is a key one; if you&#8217;re talking trade-offs and DSGE Models, you better not be looking at an area in isolation.  (Or, <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/09/quote-of-day.html">as I noted earlier</a>, if you&#8217;re looking at an area in isolation, you need to be able to explain what &#8220;equilibrium&#8221; means in context: quadrupling the amount diverted from the alleged business does <strong>not</strong> count.</p>

<blockquote>Unlike for-profit firms, a public plan has no incentive to cut corners and prevent providers from giving their patients quality evidence-based care, because its ultimate goal is public health, not private profit. Nor does it have any interest in sideswiping regulations and shortchanging consumers.  Free market proponents argue that private health insurers should be lightly regulated to give Americans the best value. We have seen the results of that sort of regulatory neglect in many industries in the past eight years; the harm to all Americans, businesses and the overall economy could not be more profound.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read <a target="_blank" href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2009/09/17/why-a-public-health-insurance-option-is-essential/">the Whole Thing</a>, since you probably won&#8217;t find it being cited at <em>The Atlantic</em>.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  Bonus quote, since it gets to the core of the matter:<br />
<blockquote>[Health insurance is an] oligopoly [market] with high entry barriers in which prices and profits have escalated rapidly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Traditional economic theory holds that there are no economic profits in a true market.* That the Health Insurance industry has realised higher profits while spending a lower portion of each dollar received on claims over the past twenty years is, economics tells us, an indication of market failure.  Strangely, the mass of economists don&#8217;t seem to be saying this.  Which is a market failure of another type.</p>
<p>*There is, of course, a fair Return on Investment embedded in the equation, but that is assumed to be the stable risk-adjusted return, not increasing in an equilibrium state.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>by Bruce Webb (Update. A tech problem currently prevents me from responding to comments, though not from updating the post. Keep those questions coming and maybe I can address them in a later post.)</p>
<p>With the release of the Baucus Chairman&#8217;s Mark it became apparent that there are some profound misconceptions floating around the existing legislation represented by HR3200 and the HELP Bill in relation to the scope of the Exchanges and the Public Option. So profound that some people are claiming the Baucus Markup, no matter egregious its faults is at least on this front an advance. Well not on my reading.</p>
<p>One misconception out there is that the Public Option is only available to those without insurance. The other which got highlighted Wednesday by Ezra Klein was that the Exchanges themelves, within which the Public Option resides are only open to individuals and employers with less than 20 employees. Either if true would eliminate the ability of the PO to develop in the direction of Universal Coverage.</p>
<p>Starting with Ezra. He put up the following on Wednesday <a target="_blank" href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/09/the_baucus_plan_and_the_exchan.html">The Baucus Plan and the Exchanges</a> he starts off with:<br />
<blockquote>Color me impressed. I&#8217;ve argued before that the Health Insurance Exchanges are the most important piece of health-care reform, and they&#8217;re being unacceptably weakened and constrained. The House bill, for instance, specifically allows businesses with only 20 or fewer people to join.</p>
<p>Baucus goes quite a bit further. He begins by mandating that businesses with up to 50 employees be allowed to buy into the exchanges. If states want, they can expand that to businesses with 100 employees.</p></blockquote>
<p> After a couple of sentences about risk adjustment he closes with this:<br />
<blockquote>So far, so good. This, however, is where the Baucus plan takes that crucial next step: &#8220;In 2017, states must develop and submit to the Secretary a phase-in schedule (not to exceed five years), including applicable rating rules, for incorporating firms with 50 or more (or 100 or more for those states that already included firms with 51-100 employees) into the state exchanges.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, by 2022, the Health Insurance Exchanges will be open to all businesses of all sizes. That&#8217;s a huge deal. And the first place where I&#8217;ve seen the Baucus bill go substantially further than the other bills</p></blockquote>
<p>Well I can only draw three possible conclusions from this. One Ezra just biffed in his reading of Sec 202 of the bill. Or I did. Or that it was inexplicably changed in all three House Committee markups.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll let you all be the judge. Relevant text under the fold.</p>
<p>The following is a direct cut and paste from my comment to Ezra, with some formatting that the WaPo site strips out.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The House bill, for instance, specifically allows businesses with only 20 or fewer people to join.&#8221;</p>
<p>It does? Where? I am working from the Ed&#038;Labor version, which I believe represents the Tri-Committee Bill PRIOR to markup. So maybe something got taken out. I don&#8217;t see why that would be, but on a plain reading the above assertion is simply a misreading.</p>
<p>The relevant section is: SEC. 202. EXCHANGE-ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS. starting on pg. 73. &#8216;Employers&#8217; are categorized in 202 (e)(1-3) starting on pg. 79 into &#8216;Smallest&#8217; or 10 employees or fewer, &#8216;Smaller&#8217; or 20 employees or fewer, and &#8220;Larger&#8217;. The rules for these latter are spelled out in 202 (e) (3) as follows:</p>
<p>(3) LARGER EMPLOYERS.— <br />(A) IN GENERAL.—Beginning with Y3, the Commissioner may permit employers not described in paragraph (1) or (2) to be Exchange eligible employers. <br />(B) PHASE-IN.—In applying subparagraph (A), the Commissioner may phase-in the application of such subparagraph based on the number of full-time employees of an employer and such other considerations as the Commissioner deems appropriate.</p>
<p>This last bit seems to mean that mega-employers can&#8217;t dump all their workers on Exchange Plans all at once.</p>
<p>The confusion may come from Sec 202 (c) starting on pg. 74<br />(c) TRANSITION.—Individuals and employers shall only be eligible to enroll or participate in the Health Insurance Exchange in accordance with the following transition schedule: <br />(1) FIRSTYEAR.—In Y1 (as defined in section 100(c))— {i.e. 2013}<br />(A) individuals described in subsection (d)(1), including individuals described in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (d); and <br />(B) smallest employers described in subsection (e)(1). <br />(2) SECOND YEAR.—In Y2— {2014}<br />(A) individuals and employers described in paragraph (1); and <br />(B) smaller employers described in subsection (e)(2). <br />(3) THIRD AND SUBSEQUENT YEARS.—In Y3 {2015} and subsequent years— <br />(A) individuals and employers described in paragraph (2); and <br />(B) larger employers as permitted by the Commissioner under subsection (e)(3).</p>
<p>Unless 202 (c)(3) and 202 (e)(3) were deleted during markup in all three Committees it would appear that all employers will become Exchange Eligible starting on Jan 1, 2015 subject only to phasing requirements for the largest companies. A process that surely would be accomplished well before the 2022 in the Baucus markup.</p>
<p>What did I miss?</p></blockquote>
<p>A plain reading (or as plain as you can get reading legislative language) is that the Exchanges will be open to employers of all sizes starting on Jan 1, 2015 or seven years EARLIER than the date touted by Ezra as a &#8220;huge deal&#8221;.</p>
<p>The related assertion that only people who are uninsured are eligible for the Public Option is similarly misguided. There are fairly strict limits on who can opt out of an employer paid plan, and for good reason (a discussion for another time) but there are no barriers for someone currently in the individual market cancelling their private plan or letting it expire and signing up in the PO. In fairness there is a tiny bit of ambiguity in the language.</p>
<blockquote><p>SEC. 202. EXCHANGE-ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS AND EMPLOYERS. </p>
<p>(a) ACCESS TO COVERAGE.—In accordance with this section, all individuals are eligible to obtain coverage through enrollment in an Exchange-participating health benefits plan offered through the Health Insurance Exchange unless such individuals are enrolled in another qualified health benefits plan or other acceptable coverage.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8216;acceptable coverage&#8217; mostly means another government run and paid for plan such as Medicare, Medicaid, VA, Tri-Care. And almost everyone in &#8216;another qualified health benefits plan&#8217; would be in one offered by an employer. I don&#8217;t read this to mean that individuals dissatisfied with current private insurance cannot shift to another insurer in the exchange which includes the Public Option. But in general I am going with &#8220;all individuals are eligible to obtain coverage&#8221;.</p>
<p>Getting this right is crucially important. If the Exchanges and the Public Option were in fact crippled in the way Ezra and others  on the Left think they are there is no wonder that they think the whole thing is a sham and a simple give-away to the insurers rather than the Public Option being a very real alternative and potential replacement to private insurance for individuals and most medium to small employers.</p>
<p>So to repeat my question to Ezra. What did I miss?</p>

<p>Quarterly private sector debt growth, households + nonfinancial business + finance, has been slowing or negative since the second half of 2007. In contrast, federal and state and local governments are selling debt like it&#8217;s going out of style, with 28.2% and 8.3% annualized debt growth in the second quarter of 2009.</p>
<p>It is no secret that the private sector is unwinding debt, but to what end? 100% of income? &#8211; 110%? &#8211; Or 65%?</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SrOOTMrXfKI/AAAAAAAACi4/yZtdr4U1B-8/s1600-h/private_debt_chart.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SrOOTMrXfKI/AAAAAAAACi4/yZtdr4U1B-8/s320/private_debt_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>According to <a href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2009/el2009-16.html">Reuven Glick and Kevin  J. Lansing at the San Francisco Fed</a>, Japanese households dropped their debt burden to 95% of disposable income. If US households were to follow a similar path, then the debt cycle would be complete in 2018.<a href="http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2009/el2009-16.html"> An excerpt from the article</a>:<br />
<blockquote>After Japan&#8217;s bubbles burst, private nonfinancial firms undertook a massive deleveraging, reducing their collective debt-to-GDP ratio from 125% in 1991 to 95% in 2001. By reducing spending on investment, the firms changed from being net borrowers to net savers. If U.S. households were to undertake a similar deleveraging, their collective debt-to-income ratio would need to drop to around 100% by year-end 2018, returning to the level that prevailed in 2002.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is deleveraging still left in the pipeline, but one cannot say that the Japanese experience foretells the path of US debt. The economic agents, their propensities to save, and underlying economic fundamentals are different: 100% debt to disposable income in Japan may not be the equilibrium level in the US. Unfortunately, though, nobody can tell you what the level is&#8230;just something less than 125%.</p>
<p>The path of saving (paying down debt)</p>
<p>The US economy has suffered a precipitous drop in consumer demand, as the marginal saving rate surged. Going forward, higher saving (the average saving rate) does not preclude income and economic growth per se, but increasing saving (the marginal saving effect) can.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SrOEp1FtaKI/AAAAAAAACiw/xJbJ0BQX2Js/s1600-h/wealth-effect+chart.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SrOEp1FtaKI/AAAAAAAACiw/xJbJ0BQX2Js/s320/wealth-effect+chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>As wealth effect ratios stabilize &#8211; the chart to the left features the wealth effect as household net worth/personal disposable income &#8211; I believe that household saving will stabilize and consumer spending will grow with income.</p>
<p>Admittedly, though, the lag structure of the recent anomalous wealth effect is not known, and the strong marginal effect on saving might continue (i.e., the saving rate grows, as in the San Francisco Fed paper). To be sure, the labor market has dropped wage growth to record lows (see Mark Thoma&#8217;s <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/09/wages-are-barely-growing.html">post here</a>), and Q2 &#8217;09 annual disposable income growth was negative (a first<a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?chart_type=line&#038;s%5B1%5D%5Bid%5D=DPI&#038;s%5B1%5D%5Btransformation%5D=pc1"> since 1951</a>). Not good for contemporaneous saving and spending growth.</p>
<p>The next four quarters, or the early period of recovery, will be critical in setting the stage for income growth. The recovery is expected to be weak, with the consensus GDP growth forecast around <a href="http://online.barrons.com/article/SB125270874685404827.html?mod=BOL_hpp_mag">2.4% in Q4 2009</a>. But given the precipitous decline in output, even a <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?chart_type=line&#038;s%5B1%5D%5Bid%5D=GDPC1&#038;s%5B1%5D%5Btransformation%5D=pca">5% annualized quarterly growth rate during the early recovery</a> would be rather &#8220;weak&#8221;. There&#8217;s room for an upside surprise as financial and housing markets stabilize.</p>

<p>Unless the economy-market is on the verge of a major unforeseen calamity S&#038;P 500 earnings per share growth will turn positive in the fourth quarter. Generally analysts are positive on the market because they expect very strong earnings growth in 2010. This will be the twelfth time since 1950 that earnings growth has turned positive.</p>
<p>Even if you make extremely conservative projections, EPS growth in 2009 will be very strong. In the first two quarters already reported EPS was in the $14-$15 range. If you assume that EPS will be in this same range in the second half of the year it generates an estimated EPS growth for 2009 on the order of 50%.</p>
<p>On average, in the previous eleven times, the market was virtually flat. But this flat average was a product of six significant declines or bear market and five rising or bull markets. The average contains almost 25% drops in 1961 and 1987 and a 20% rise in 1968.</p>
<p>I guess this is the time to talk about the 6&#8242; economist who drowned fording a stream where the average depth was 3&#8242;.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SrJpk18EBEI/AAAAAAAAA3s/vr_CGlajzh4/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SrJpk18EBEI/AAAAAAAAA3s/vr_CGlajzh4/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" border="0"></a><br />Since 1950 the market has been above its year ago level some 72.5% of the time. But in the first year after earnings growth turned positive, the market is only up 45% of the time. So one of the most dangerous times in the market is in the first year after earnings growth turns positive. It is another consequence of the point that the correlation between the change in earnings and the change in the market is essentially zero.</p>
<p>The difference between rising and falling markets was not earnings growth. On average, in the six years the market fell earnings rose 19% and in the five years the market rose earnings rose 16%.</p>
<p>Rather, the difference was between valuation and the impact of rising interest rates.When the market fell, bond yields rose while when the market rose, yields fell. In general the relationship between the market PE and bond yields is roughly one-to-one. That is, a 100 basis point rise in yields generates roughly a 100 basis point fall in the market PE.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SrJpzaXT-0I/AAAAAAAAA38/ltbyhUq672E/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SrJpzaXT-0I/AAAAAAAAA38/ltbyhUq672E/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" border="0"></a><br />But when the market is overvalued, as it is now, rising interest rates can have a much more severe impact as the market quickly eliminates its&#8217; overvaluation as it did in 1961 and 1987.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SrJp7Xdg6vI/AAAAAAAAA4E/2REZ_8-7LoE/s1600-h/Clipboard04.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SrJp7Xdg6vI/AAAAAAAAA4E/2REZ_8-7LoE/s320/Clipboard04.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The current rally is being driven by the liquidity the Fed has flooded the system with over the past year. But in 2010, if the economy is rebounding, and particularly if growth is stronger than expected, the Fed will be under intense pressure to drain this liquidity. Some Fed spokesmen are already warnings that rates could rise rapidly over the next year.</p>

<p>Michigan&#8217;s Carl Levin gave the keynote address at the Washington conference of the Task Force on Financial Integrity and Economic Development. (For information on the organization, visit its website at http://www.financialtaskforce.org. Levin&#8217;s remarks, and soon a YouTube of the conference, are available <a target="_blank" href="http://www.financialtaskforce.org/2009/09/16/senator-levin-addresses-the-task-force-conference/">here</a>.). His theme&#8211;offshore tax abuse&#8211;is described with spy-novel aplumb.<br />
<blockquote>[W]hat&#8217;s been happening in the offshore tax haven world reads like the stuff of a novel. It involves billions of dollars in hidden assets, secret documents, clandestine meetings, and scheming in cities around the world. It involves conflict among some of the world&#8217;s richest nations. And in recent months, political events have caused a near earthquake in the offshore world that has shaken the marbled headquarters of some of the world&#8217;s richest private banks serving some of the world&#8217;s wealthiest people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Levin is right-on as to the importance of this effort. As he says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tax evaders reap enormous benefits from civil society &#8211; they enjoy the security our military and law enforcement agencies provide; they invest and prosper thanks to the rule of law and sanctity of contract which our regulators and court system enforce; and they build their economic future on the financial, communications, and transportation infrastructure that taxpayers finance. What we ask in return is that all members of society pay that share of their income that they owe, so that governments can continue to protect fundamental rights and provide basic services. If that social contract breaks down and some refuse to pay their share, the effects on civil society are caustic. Ending offshore tax abuse is about more than money; it is about protecting the principles upon which our economic and political systems are built.</p></blockquote>
<p>Levin provides a chronology of our progress in ferreting out, and acting to reduce, the offshore tax evasion schemes aided and abetted by multinational enterprises like Enron, KPMG, and the UBS banking conglomerate that the investigative committee thinks has cost the US about $100 billion a year in tax revenues:</p>
<p>1991: US banks offering private banking services to foreign heads of states that helped them hide illicit funds</p>
<p>2001: use of US banks by small offshore banks to move drug trafficking funds</p>
<p>2002: Enron&#8217;s use of phony offshore transactions to inflate revenues/minimize taxes (440 shell companies in the Caymans, among other entities used)</p>
<p>2003: tax scams developed and marketed by major accounting firm KPMG</p>
<p>2004: US banking assistance to Augusto Pinochet</p>
<p>2006: US taxpayers using tax havens to dodge US taxes</p>
<p>2008-9: LGT bank of Lichtenstein and UBS bank of Switzerland using banking secrecy laws to help wealthy US residents conceal assets and evade taxes</p>
<p>Part of the story is the way the US finally was able to start prosecuting some of the most egregious US tax evaders who had hidden their assets in this way. Two whistleblowers&#8211;one at the Lichtenstein bank and one at UBS&#8211;sacrificed their normal lives to reveal names and the entrenched and accepted customs of the banks of taking exhaustive steps to get around US laws to &#8220;service&#8221; wealthy clients&#8217; tax evasion wants (secret codes, encrypted computers, pay phones, transfers of money in and out of accounts to block audit trails, secret visits to US clients, counter-surveillance training, smuggling diamonds in tubes of toothpaste). </p>
<p>Levin claims that the recent &#8220;wins&#8221; against Switzerland and Liechtenstein means that the good guys are &#8220;on the march&#8221; with &#8220;more progress in the last year than [in] the previous ten years combined.&#8221; The theme is that the OECD model agreement on tax information sharing will essentially end the use of bank secrecy laws for tax evasion. </p>
<p>(I hope so, though I remain unconvinced, without further changes. Even if the Swiss expand the exception from &#8220;tax fraud&#8221; to &#8220;tax evasion&#8221;, it still appears that far too much must be known by the US before it can seek specific account information from the Swiss, when the secrecy of the Swiss information will preevent the US from having enough information to seek more information. We&#8217;ll have to see as the facts come out. Even Levin admitted that: &#8220;the model agreement has traditionally been interpreted as requiring a country to supply information only when a requesting jurisdction has the name of a specific, suspect taxpayer. Most governments take the psotion that if the requesting jursidction doesn&#8217;t have the taxpayer&#8217;s name, no information can be shared, even if the bank secrecy laws make obtaining that taxpayer&#8217;s name difficult or impossible. That has to change.&#8221; (emphasis added).)</p>
<p>As Levin notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, the battle to end offshore tax abuse is far from over. And I am concerned that in our spy story, the good guys may declare victory and relax before the villains are vanquished. We need to take action now to ensure we get a happy ending.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the actions recommended seems like a great idea, if countries only have the willpower to do it: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;having all G-20 countries adopt rules that require their financial institutions from doing business with an offending bank or jurisdiction-, thus essentially locking them out of the financial system of the G-20 countries.</p></blockquote>
<p>Levin urges the passage of the &#8220;Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act S 506&#8221;. (I&#8217;ve commented on it before.) Many of the provisions should clearly be passed because they represent workable measures to combat offshre tax abuse, such as taking steps against the banks or jurisdictions, heightening reporting requirements, expanding the statute of limitations so there is more time to track the money, and toughening penalties. </p>
<p>Levin also argued for the &#8220;Incoporation Transparency and Law Enforcement Assistance Act&#8221; S 569, which would require reporting of beneficial ownership when corporations and limited liabilities companies are created in the United States. As he notes, <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;[t]his corporate secrecy frustrates law enforcement &#8230; and undermines U.S. efforts to persuade offshore jurisdictions to identify the beneficial owners of the companies they form.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Norman Borlaug, Michael Jackson, and the Invisible Hand</p>
<p>When Adam Smith described the concept of laissez-faire capitalism, he argued that it was not just efficient but moral.  As long as everyone acted in their own self-interest and the government did not interfere, the Invisible Hand would guide market forces toward the best possible outcome for society.  Its generally accepted that this doesn&#8217;t always work in the presence of externalities; someone (i.e., government) has to be there to ensure that people don&#8217;t exercise their right to swing their fist beyond the start of other people&#8217;s noses.  </p>
<p>But there is another problem which seems to be less highly recognized, namely that the whole concept of the Invisible Hand itself is bull$#^&#038;.  As an example, I&#8217;m writing this a few minutes after reading about the death of Norman Borlaug.  He was a Nobel Laureate who developed disease-resistant and fast growing crops.  Depending on who you ask, his work saved the lives of somewhere between a quarter of a billion and a billion people.  So far.  If we don&#8217;t all die in some sort of cataclysm in the next fifteen minutes, that number will only grow.  </p>
<p>Now consider another person recently deceased &#8211; Michael Jackson.  I believe Jackson was finally buried some time last week.  Aside from being known the world over, Jackson was very wealthy, despite his clear incompetence with money.  He probably made at least one dollar for every life saved by Norman Borlaug, so far.  Norman Borlaug, on the other hand, to the best of my knowledge, did not.  Furthermore, this discrepancy in income is very, very, very hard to attribute to government interference.  </p>
<p>Which means, there are two possible alternatives:</p>
<p>1.  Michael Jackson did more positive things for the world than Norman Borlaug.  <br />2.  Michael Jackson did less positive things for the world than Norman Borlaug. </p>
<p>There is no third option.  None.  Now, I think very, very few people, even die-hard Michael Jackson fans, when presented with numbers like &#8220;a quarter of a billion lives saved so far&#8221; would agree with option 1.  Which leaves option 2.  And if option 2, then the Invisible Hand is bull$#^&#038;.  Which means capitalism doesn&#8217;t work or is immoral.  That does not imply any other philosophical system would work better, mind you, but trusting the market to do its thing provides perverse results. <br />_______________________________________<br />by cactus</p>
<p>UPDATE by Ken:</p>
<p>I mentioned this in comments, but I think it&#8217;s worth embedding here, too, as context for Norman Borlaug:

<blockquote>The Court observes that the President defeated seven opponents in a grueling campaign for his party’s nomination that lasted more than eighteen months and cost those opponents well over $300 million. Then the President faced a formidable opponent in the general election who received $84 million to conduct his general election campaign against the President.</p>
<p>It would appear that ample opportunity existed for discovery of evidence that would support any contention that the President was not eligible for the office he sought. To press her &#8220;birther agenda,&#8221; Plaintiff’s counsel has filed the present action on behalf of Captain Rhodes&#8230;.</p>
<p>The American taxpayers paid for her third and fourth years of medical school and financially supported her during her subsequent medical internship and residency program. In exchange for this valuable free medical education, Captain Rhodes agreed to serve two years in active service in the Army. She began that term of active service in July of 2008 and had no concerns about fulfilling her military obligation until she received orders notifying her that she would be deployed to Iraq in September of 2009.</p>
<p>Captain Rhodes does not seek a discharge from the Army; nor does she wish to be relieved entirely from her two year active service obligation. She has not previously made any official complaints regarding any orders or assignments that she has received, including orders that have been issued since President Obama became Commander in Chief. But she does not want to go to Iraq (or to any other destination where she may be in harm’s way, for that matter). Her &#8220;conscientious objections&#8221; to serving under the current Commander in Chief apparently can be accommodated as long as she is permitted to remain on American soil.</p></blockquote>
