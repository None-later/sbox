<p>Even with an individual mandate which comes with a substantial fine for non-compliance 6% of the legal non-elderly population end up still uninsured and a total of 25 million uninsured total, most of whom would be legal. And people above 300% of poverty getting no help at all.</p>
<p>Change we can count on? Sheesh.</p>

<p>There is always an agenda when a central banker declares the recession is over &#8211; and <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/events/2009/0915_financial_crisis.aspx">Bernanke is no different</a>. The following facts remain: US GDP contracted at a 1% annualized pace in the second quarter of 2009 (its fourth consecutive drop), industrial output grew just two consecutive months after declining every month (except one) since January 2008, employment is still falling, retail sales are improving somewhat, and real personal income has formed no discernible upward trend.</p>
<p>In that light, the most accurate description of Bernanke&#8217;s declaration is that he &#8220;thinks&#8221; the recession is over, rather than it &#8220;is&#8221; over. His strategic announcement plays on market expectations to the upside, just as announcing that the recession is underway would play on expectations to the downside.</p>
<p>Are central bankers generally more apt to declare the end of a recession sooner that the beginning? I bet that they are. Will an AB reader do a little investigative reporting to find the first time that Bernanke acknowledged the onset of the 07-09 recession? My money&#8217;s on 12/08, the date when the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/dec2008.html">NBER declared it as such</a> and a year after it began.</p>
<p>To his credit, much of Bernanke&#8217;s <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/events/2009/0915_financial_crisis.aspx">Brookings address</a> was spent highlighting the weak recovery that is expected. Bernanke is brilliant and surrounds himself with likewise brilliant economists &#8211; but data is data; and he sees what I see, which is a murky bottom and expected positive growth.</p>
<p>The charts below illustrate the key monthly macroeconomic variables used by the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">National Bureau of Economic Research</a> to date the recession peak and trough by month: <a href="http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/pi/pinewsrelease.htm">real income</a> (I use personal income through July), <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.toc.htm">employment</a> (through August), <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/">industrial production </a>(through August), and wholesale-<a href="http://www.census.gov/retail/">retail sales</a> (through August). </p>

<p>George Cooper is on to something in his book &#8220;The Origin of Financial Crises&#8221; (highly recommended). He criticizes central banking for adhering to efficient markets thinking, which leads to lax policy on the upside of the business cycle, i.e., allowing aggregate demand to outpace underlying fundamentals, and overly aggressive policy on the way down.</p>
<p>In this light, central bankers might be quicker to face the end of the recession and slower to conclude the onset of one. It is akin to policy mistakes being made on the way up and a triumph on the way down.</p>

<blockquote>Government bureaucrats don&#8217;t reduce costs.  Market competition reduces costs.  The challenge for health care reform is to get the market competition into the places where we want it &#8212; providers and insurers competing to deliver better services at lower prices &#8212; and out of the places where we don&#8217;t want it &#8212; insurers competing to insure only the lowest risks and providers gaming the government reimbursement systems to earn the highest profits.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Government might possibly keep [one] safe and therefore the billions wasted are money well-spent. [One] graciously permits the government to police [one&#8217;s] bar-hopping, repair the roads [one] drives on, clean [one&#8217;s] water and deliver it to [one&#8217;s] door, remove [one&#8217;s] bodily waste, treat it, and release it far from [one&#8217;s] view.</p>
<p>The government hauls away [one&#8217;s] garbage, keeps [one&#8217;s] lights on, pumps natural gas into [one&#8217;s] water heater, <em>for far less money than it would cost if [one] had to do it on [one&#8217;s] own</em>. It keeps food manufacturers from poisoning [one], and inspects the restaurants [one] visits, the buildings [one] lives and works in, the cars that whizz by [one] on the freeway.

It educated most of the people who fix [one&#8217;s] dishwasher, [one&#8217;s] car, [one&#8217;s] hair, [one&#8217;s] dog. All of that is perfectly okay. But health care for people drowning in rising premiums?&#8230;[T]here the benefits must stop, there the line must be drawn.[emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>

<p>For the last two months much of the talk around Health Care Reform has been about the Gang of Six of the Senate Finance Commitee to the point that some people think the Gang and the Committee are one and the same. But this is not true at all, this week Chairman Baucus will release the Chairman&#8217;s Mark, shaped as it is by contributions from other members of the Gang, and will be faced with getting it through the full Finance Committee, itself largely shut out from the process to date. So for at least the moment the math changes, instead of crafting a bill that could potentially get 60 votes in the full Senate, Baucus is now face with pushing a bill out of the Committee with majority support, which in this case means 12 of 23 votes. The following names are in Committee seniority order with members of the Sub-Committee on Health Care marked with an &#8216;H&#8217; and members of the Gang of Six marked with a &#8216;G&#8217;</p>
<p>Democrats<br />MAX BAUCUS, MT (G)<br />JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER IV, WV (H-Sub-Committee Chair)<br />KENT CONRAD, ND (G)<br />JEFF BINGAMAN, NM (G) (H)<br />JOHN F. KERRY, MA (H)<br />BLANCHE L. LINCOLN, AR (H)<br />RON WYDEN, OR (H)<br />CHARLES E. SCHUMER, NY (H)<br />DEBBIE STABENOW, MI (H)<br />MARIA CANTWELL, WA (H)<br />BILL NELSON, FL (H)<br />ROBERT MENENDEZ, NJ (H)<br />THOMAS CARPER, DE (H)</p>
<p>Republicans<br />CHUCK GRASSLEY, IA (G)<br />ORRIN G. HATCH, UT (H-Ranking Member)<br />OLYMPIA J. SNOWE, ME (G) (H)<br />JON KYL, AZ (H)<br />JIM BUNNING, KY (H)<br />MIKE CRAPO, ID (H)<br />PAT ROBERTS, KS <br />JOHN ENSIGN, NV (H)<br />MIKE ENZI, WY (G) (H)<br />JOHN CORNYN, TX  (H)</p>
<p>First thing to note is that Health is a big Sub-Committee that includes all but four members of the full Committee which might explain why Baucus chose to take it to a smaller group. But inspection of the list shows a curious thing, the Gang of Six managed to include three out of the four members who are NOT on the Finance Health Sub-Committee and so would include those people not committed enough to Health Care to even request a seat.</p>
<p>Second thing is that while Sub-Committee Ranking Member Hatch was originally included in what was then a Gang of Seven, he dropped out early, and Sub-Committee Chair Jay Rockefeller, the person you would expect a priori to have the biggest interest in this topic, was frozen out altogether. Nor did the Gang respect seniority, as noted it jumped over the number two Democrat on the full Committee roster in Rockefeller but also dipped deep on the Republican bench to pick up Enzi.</p>
<p>Third is the arithmetic. In order to get marked up legislation out of Committee Chairman Baucus needs twelve of twenty-three votes. We know from news reports that he has no support from nine Republicans, although he continues negotiation with the Gang of Six both Grassley and Enzi are on record that they will not vote for the final version. Which means that even if he retains the support of remaining Republican Gang member Snowe he needs the support of ten of the remaining Democrats to get to the magic number of twelve to achieve a majority. Without Snowe he can only afford to lose a single Democrat. Which at this point means the side-lined Chair of the Finance Subcommittee who the New Republic reports came out firmly against the Baucus Plan on Tuesday afternoon <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-treatment/breaking-rockefeller-says-no-way-support-baucus-bill-present-form">Breaking: Rockefeller Says &#8220;No Way&#8221; on Baucus Framework</a><br />
<blockquote>I have sat besides Max Baucus for 22 years on the Finance Committee. &#8230; I&#8217;m probably one of his best friend among Democrats. But I cannot agree with him on this bill. &#8230; There is no way in present form I will vote for it. Therefore, I will not vote for it unless it changes during the amendment process by vast amounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conventional wisdom was that the bill that would supply the framework for the bill on the Senate floor was going to be that of the Finance Committee and that moreover that bill would be fundamentally the work product of Baucus&#8217;s Gang of Six. But while Baucus asserts that the work of the Gang will continue, the fate of the bill over the next week will be determined by who can get twelve votes.</p>
<p>In a battle between full Committee Chair Baucus and Health Sub-Committee Chair Rockefeller who holds the strongest hand? We&#8217;ll see. But Rockefeller only needs to hold Kerry and Wyden to keep Baucus from an outright win, and one would think at a minimum he can hold Schumer and Stabenow, each of whom&#8217;s states look to be big winners from near universal health care.</p>
<p>My inbox tells me the Baucus Plan was just released so I expect to be back with some links and discussion. In the meanwhile: any early thoughts?</p>
<p>(Update one) SWEET. The NYT has the PDF of the Chairman&#8217;s mark in a navigable form on their site.<br />http://documents.nytimes.com/baucus-proposal-to-overhaul-health-care#p=1</p>

<p>Industrial output rose 0.8 percent in August, following an upwardly revised increase of 1.0 percent in July. Production in manufacturing expanded 0.6 percent in August, and the index excluding motor vehicles and parts increased 0.4 percent. The gain in July for manufacturing was revised up 0.4 percentage point, to1.4 percent; in addition, factory output for April through June is now somewhat less weak than reportedpreviously.</p>
<p>Compared to other cycles the first two months rebound appears normal, neither weak nor strong.</p>

Of course, the US no longer has the<br />capacity to build that many cars and trucks.</p>
<p>With hours worked in manufacturing unchanged last month this implies that the recently reported surge in manufacturing productivity is continuing.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I am not questioning Senator Olympia Snowe&#8217;s integrity.  The Snowe job in question was my attempt to convince myself that Senator Snowe agrees with me.  When reflecting on the question I discover that she strongly disagrees with Senator Snowe.  I can see that the problem of health care reform has caused her to struggle intellecutally, but I don&#8217;t know if she is wrestling desperately or Grassling* brilliantly.</p>
<p>thoughts after the jump.</p>
<p>OK first the Snowe job.  <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/58929-democrats-to-go-it-alone">Snowe has two objections to the Baucus proposal</a> (<a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_09/019962.php">via Steve Benen</a>) .  One is that financing subsidies by taxing expensive insurance policies will hurt Maine, since insurance premia are high in Maine (note it takes a sort of inverted political genius to insist on a financing mechanism which is bad for Maine).  The second is that the subsidies are too stingy.  On the second point Snowe agrees with most Democrats who are not Baucus.  The 3 other plans have more generous subsidies.</p>
<p>So, I thought, maybe she supports a bill with more generous subsidies and a different financing mechanism.  The alternative which has been discussed is a tax on rich people.  Maybe she supports the House Energy and Commerce Committee bill.</p>
<p>But she worries about the total gross spending increases (generally called &#8220;costs&#8221; in the press).  Hmm well they could be cut if there were a public option so maybe &#8230;</p>
<p>Then I realised that I was dreaming.  She has also asked for the public option to be taken off the table.  </p>
<p>The costs are the costs of subsidies and medicaid expansion.  Snowe has said the subsidies and medicaid expansion are too stingy and that the costs are too high.  Her implied proposal is not just impractical, it violates arithmetic.  She has definitely and specifically called the exact same outlays too large and too small.  </p>
<p>Given the definition of &#8220;costs&#8221; they can&#8217;t be reduced by cutting spending except for spending on subsidies and medicaid expansion.  &#8220;Costs&#8221; are the sum of spending increases not spending increases minus spending cuts.  I determine the definition of this strange new technical term from the fact that the reduction of medicare advantage giveaways to insurance companies doesn&#8217;t reduce &#8220;costs.&#8221; </p>
<p>On financing, the fact that she opposes the tax on expensive insurance doesn&#8217;t mean that she supports a tax on the rich, any other tax increase or more deficit spending.   </p>
<p>It almost looks as if she is deliberately imposing conditions each of which sounds good to the uninformed, but which can&#8217;t all be satisfied because they are logically inconsistent.  I still Snowe myself into thinking she is honestly struggling, but honestly, it&#8217;s beginning to be a struggle.</p>
<p>*To Grassle<br />Verb.  To sabotage negotiations by demanding secrecy, privately promising that one is close to saying yes, publicly promise nothing and constantly make new objections each of which seems to require concessions which aren&#8217;t extreme enough to be deal breakers.</p>
<p>This is a very common diplomatic technique.  I don&#8217;t want to violate al Goodwin&#8217;s law, but one extreme case was Saddam Hussein in 1991.  One international statesman after another communicated the demand that he take his army out of Kuwait.  Each emerged smiling assuring the world that they were close to a diplomatic solution, but not quite there yet.</p>
<p>Generally one does not hope to block and delay *and* win concessions even after it becomes clear that one will never say yes.  The current Baucus plan makes me wonder how the world would have reacted if Bush Sr had driven the Iraqi army out of Kuwait and then forced the Kuwaiti&#8217;s to stop pumping so much oil from oil fields which straddled the Iraq Kuwait border.</p>
<p>The point of Grassling is to take a lot of time.  People who waste time debaiting the details of a proposal that they want to block (that is filibuster intelligentl) can be said to act grassly the adverb that corresponds to the verb to Grassle.  They congressman who shouted &#8220;you lie&#8221; acted crassly but not grassly.</p>

<p>“Great Benefit is like a Giant Slot Machine that never pays off”. The RainMaker, John Grisham</p>
<p>Private Healthcare Insurance companies paid off for those from whom they can profit. The rest of us who are costly because of age, disorders, or illness are bound to find ourselves without private insurance and too young or high in income for government insurance. Private healthcare insurance is not insurance, it is speculation, a gamble upon your health and the returns from your premium. Those who have healthcare insurance are those insured by the government.</p>
<p>“This builds into another favorite Grisham premise &#8212; that the idea that the courts are jammed with nuisance lawsuits is backward. Average people haven&#8217;t a clue as to their rights because the law has become as removed and alien as another planet, Grisham suggests.” <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/04/13/DD22445.DTL">“Grisham Is Back In Court”</a></p>
<p>The push to reform medical malpractice laws focuses on lawsuits being the cause for higher insurance costs for doctors, driving doctors out of practice, and as a major contributor to overall healthcare cost. In the past, I have answered on the question of medical malpractice lawsuits and the impact on healthcare costs. Not having a degree in law, I can not answer for the legality of lawsuits; but, I can continue to point out the insignificance of medical malpractice lawsuit cost on the overall healthcare cost. I will add, it would make sense to modify medical malpractice law if people did not have to pay out $thousands to care for themselves or someone else who has suffered temporary or permanent debilitating injury as a result of a doctor, hospital, corporation, or medical practice’s negligence. If universal healthcare were in place, the need for a major component of malpractice law suits, awards for hospitalization or nursing care, could potentially be nullified. Today without such a plan in place, it is inconceivable to eliminate the only manner in which an individual can recoup expenses from a hospital, a corporation, or a doctor’s practice/business when nothing exists to take care of the victim. </p>
<p>In 2004 Bush claimed; &#8220;The health care system looks like a giant lottery. That is what it looks like these days with these lawsuits and somehow the trial lawyers are always holding the winning ticket.&#8221; Again in 2006 President Bush cited Medical Malpractice Lawsuits as the biggest issue driving doctors out of business; however, the numbers of physicians are rising at a ratio faster than the population and at the same time as profits for malpractice insurance companies. 15 malpractice insurers in Florida had profits increase by ~$800 million in 2005. While insurance premiums may be rising for doctors and profits are rising for insurance companies, the numbers of malpractice suits resulting in payment have been declining. From 2001 to 2005, the numbers of payments decreased from 16,588 to 14,033 and are reflected in payments/awards per 100,000 made on behalf of doctors going from 5.82 to 4.73. When adjusted for inflation, total malpractice payments over the 14 years have gone from $2.11 billion in 1991 to $2.14 billion in 2005 or an increase of ½ of 1%.   <a target="_blank" href="http://www.citizen.org/documents/NPDB%20Report_Final.pdf">“The Medical Tort Reform Debate”</a> Public Citizen 2007</p>
<p>In the seventies, Tom Baker (Univ. of PA Prof. of Law and Health Sciences) recalled similar issues being discussed by his father around the dinner table accusing medical malpractice lawsuits of driving up the cost of healthcare, insurance premiums, and driving doctors out of business. In the mid 1970s, the California Hospital and Medical Associations sponsored a study on the “exploding” frequency of medical malpractice suits. The investigation found thousands of people injured by malpractice; but, few of the injured actually sued. The study was never brought to the forefront in California until the passage of restrictive malpractice lawsuit reforms in California. The study then emerged from the background it was placed in and published in an association report and failed to get the public acknowledgement it deserved. </p>
<p>Since the seventies, the topic of malpractice lawsuits surfaced again in the eighties, at the turn of the century, and again now. Other studies since the seventies California study have confirmed what was found then in California in the seventies: too much medical malpractice with little malpractice litigation; the actual costs of medical malpractice having little to do with the litigation; medical malpractice insurance premiums being cyclical and having little to do with litigation or runaway juries; and many undeserving malpractice suits being brought forth because people can not find out what happened. What can be counted on is continued pressure to draw the attention away from the ~100,000 cases of malpractice yearly and rising insurance premiums until such time as premiums decline for doctors. Little if nothing has been done to lower the incidence of malpractice by doctors, which are mostly mistakes. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/036480.html">“The Medical Malpractice Myth,”</a> Tom Baker.</p>
<p>August 2009, “<a href="http://prescriptions.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/08/31/would-tort-reform-lower-health-care-costs/">Would Tort Reform Lower Healthcare Costs?</a>” Tom Baker answers questions in the NYT Health Section. Tom Baker made the following observation on medical malpractice reform:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Because it’s (tort reform) a red herring. It’s become a talking point for those who want to obstruct change. But [tort reform] doesn’t accomplish the goal of bringing down costs.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It is claimed the vast number of malpractice lawsuits drive up healthcare costs at a rate of 10 &#8211; 15% per year. The reality with malpractice suits is an increase in the cost of healthcare of ~1.5% or ~ $31 billion (2007) against a $2 trillion healthcare economy. What is driving up the cost of healthcare and healthcare insurance are overhead and administrative costs, an aging population, chronic illness, a growing population of people with poor life style habits, fragmentation of the industry, technological advances, poor planning, and the wealth of the populace who have more disposable income.</p>
<p>Comments on how doctors are practicing increased defensive medicine because of potentially being sued are not as true as some would have us believe. What has been found are doctors practicing medicine consistent within the standards and practices of the region in which the doctors are located. A 1996 Florida study did find a potential 5-7% increase in costs as a result of Florida’s doctors practicing defense healthcare with regard to heart disease. After a few years, the same authors rechecked the percentages and found the potential cost increases dropped to 2.5 – 3.5% with this drop coming about after managed healthcare came into being. </p>
<p>As are the plaintiffs bringing medical malpractice lawsuits, lawsuits are an easy target to vilify. It gives most people and critics vision of $millions in “sugar plums” being unjustly awarded for little or no reason. Medical malpractice lawsuits are the poster child for the rising costs of healthcare and insurance even when they have little impact. In any case, the elimination of malpractice suits will do little to slow the rising cost of healthcare or insurance and as Prof Baker points out a “red herring used to obstruct change.” Many states already have caps on malpractice awards ranging from $250,000 to $500,000 for pain and suffering and these caps do not index for inflation. The visions of $millions being recouped do not exist for most plaintiffs. </p>
<p>In the period of 1991 – 2005 82% of malpractice rewards went to injuries such as death (~32%), significant permanent injury (~19%), major permanent injury (~19%), and quadriplegic, brain, and lifelong care (~13%). The average medical malpractice award in 1991 was ~$281,000 and grew to ~$486,000 in 2005. When adjusted for inflation, the average for 2005 decreases to ~$260,000 or a decrease of ~8% in the size of malpractice awards when compared to 1991. The false premise of being awarded $millions typically does not happen. ~2.4% of payments in 2005 were > $1 million and ½ of 1% were > $1 million over the 1991-2005 period.

<p>Michael Mandel at Businessweek had a post on the subject of where are health care costs rising the fastest.</p>
<p>http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2009/09/where_are_healt.htm</p>
<p>In the post he posted this table and used it as the basis for making comparisons of the growth of health care spending in various countries.</p>
<p><img alt="healthiness_3584_image001.gif" src="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/healthiness_3584_image001.gif" height="615" width="491"></p>
<p>But the analysis is flawed.  Note it is in terms of Purchasing Power Parity (PPP).</p>
<p>If you calculate a country&#8217;s growth in medical spending from this the results are meaningless.</p>
<p>Take Korea for example.  The table shows that health care spending  rose 9.6%.  But this rise could stems from several different causes.  It might be because domestic spending on health care rose 9.6% and the exchange rate used to calculate the PPP terms  was unchanged.</p>
<p>Alternatively, it could mean that spending in the domestic currency was unchanged and the exchange rate used to calculate it in PPP terms changed by 9.6%.</p>
<p>Because of this these growth rate comparisons are meaningless.</p>
<p>It may be a valid exercise to use PPP terms to compare the level of spending on health care between two countries.  But you can not use it to calculate meaningful comparisons of the growth in health care spending in different countries.</p>
<p>This posting by Mandel is being cited by numerous blogs yesterday and today and they are all making this same fundamental error.</p>

No pun intended&#8230;much.  Mark Thoma carries the video.  Few bloggers write extensive comments (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/sep/14/lehmans-one-year-after1">Stiglitz</a> an exception) except appear to be saying good bye to meaningful regulation.  Barney Frank says regulation can happen by the end of November.</p>
<p>Let me point people to this link from <a href="http://www.tradersmagazine.com/news/fsa-sec-compensation-financial-stability-board-104372-1.html?ET=tradersmagazine:e390:55932a:&#038;st=email">Tradersmagazine</a> on the European and British take on compensation aspect of financial stability reform <a target="_blank" href="http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/policy/ps09_15.pdf">Final Rules</a> from the Financial Stability Reform program in Britain:</p>
<blockquote><p>In mid-August, the Financial Services Authority in London released its final rules regarding compensation practices by the financial services firms it regulates. The rules must be implemented by Jan. 1, 2010.</p>
<p>The final rules followed a &#8220;consultation&#8221; on earlier proposals, much like the SEC&#8217;s &#8220;notice and comment&#8221; procedures, which were discussed in our earlier article published on March 17, entitled &#8220;Compensation in the New Regulatory Environment.&#8221; As expected, the proposal received extensive comments, including some strident criticism from financial services firms. As a result, the final rules were watered down a bit. The rules now exempt smaller firms, and the compensation rules generally apply only to senior executives and managers who are important to the firm&#8217;s business.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the note from the Tradersmagazine&#8217;s author ends this way:</p>
<blockquote><p>Critics of these regulatory changes have correctly pointed out that the financial services industry will have difficulty attracting the same caliber of employee that it did in the past. But, they haven&#8217;t done a very good job of explaining why this is a bad thing. Whether or not this is good or bad for the country as a whole, or for that matter the global economy, depends on where all of this creative energy ends up being employed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back to physics and math?  Pays less, but has the correct context.  Of course, now we should read the proposals from overseas&#8230;  </p>
<p>I suppose the big question is&#8230; for market people: how does pay day reflect the time frames of risks taken, and/or more basic who defines risk, riskier, riskiest anymore?  Is it still to be rating firms and sales pitches&#8230;will that remain as our basic source of information?</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I am trying to read John Cochrane&#8217;s comments on Paul Krugman&#8217;s article on why economists got it so wrong. I tend to get upset while reading. I have managed to get through the first paragraph in which Cochrane compares Krugman to someone who denies that HIV causes AIDS and compares developments in economics to progress in the natural sciences. Now in the natural sciences, there are counter intuitive models which are consistent with all available data and have withstood many tests. Also there are once mysterious facts which are explained by theories to the satisfaction of all people familiar with the theories. </p>
<p>So I wondered what puzzles have ceased to be puzzling due to work by macroeconomists in my lifetime (November 9 1960 &#8211; present). I especially wonder if any mysteries were explained by macroeconomists not named Milton Friedman. After the jump and some more throat clearing, I will get to examples.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m counting growth theory as another field. </p>
<p>I have often written about the fact that economists (especially but not only fresh water economists) are unperturbed by regection of their theories by data. They identify &#8220;theory&#8221; with &#8220;a set of models&#8221; and note that models are false by definition. This is not at all true of theories in the natural sciences. It is very likely that all existing theories are false, but they are not false by definition and the discovery that they are inconsistent with data shocks scientists when it occurs. It also causes them to, first try to modify the theory to fit the new data and second (and very often) to abandon the theory. This is not the approach taken by economists. Models of say labor markets or financial markets which are rejected by the data are, nonetheless, used in macro models, based on the argument that if it is false therefore it is a useful approximation.</p>
<p>But what about mysteries resolved. There was a mystery &#8212; why were so many gay men in New York dying following a collapse of their immune system. Almost all scientists familiar with the data agree that an explanation has been found. AIDS remains horrible, but it is not mysterious.</p>
<p>So what macroeconomic mysteries were resolved ? And were any resolved by anyone but Milton Friedman ? </p>
<p>1) in a cross section consumption increases less than proportionally with income. As a result, many brilliant and famous economists (yes one was named Keynes) expected that as average income rises, the ratio of consumption to GNP would fall. This didn&#8217;t happen. The two facts are no longer mysterious at all. They are both implications of the permanent income hypothesis (PIH) or of a model in which part of consumption is according the the PIH and part is by liquidity constrained consumers who live paycheck to paycheck. The PIH explained many strange facts in the cross section of consumption. Just for example African Americans consume less than White Americans with the same income. Why ? Seems an odd fact, but it follows since average African American income is lower so if you have Black and White with the same income it is probabally an unusually good year for the Black family and/or a bad year for the White family.</p>
<p>Mysteries resolved.</p>
<p>2) why the hell is there a Phillips curve which related unemployment and inflation in the USA and UK ? How could this happen ? Well it would happen if expected inflation were about constant because there had not been persistent shifts in inflation. So Friedman predicted that the relationship would disappear if there were persistent inflation. And so it did. Now this wasn&#8217;t exactly a new insight. Everyone knew there is no Phillips curve during hyperinflations. </p>
<p>As a matter of fact Keynes specifically warned that economists shouldn&#8217;t hope to find a simple stable relationship between increased nominal demand and nominal wages which would imply a relationship between inflation and unemployment. Discussing the hope of finding, well something like a robust valid Phillips curve he wrote &#8220;they do not readily lend themselves to theoretical generalisations.&#8221; (General Theory Chapter 21 section VII paragraph 2) and, after deriving a Phillips curve from implausible assumtions </p>
<blockquote><p>I do not myself attach much value to manipulations of this kind; and I would repeat the warning, which I have given above, that they involve just as much tacit assumption as to what variables are taken as independent (partial differentials being ignored throughout) as does ordinary discourse, whilst I doubt if they carry us any further than ordinary discourse can. Perhaps the best purpose served by writing them down is to exhibit the extreme complexity of the relationship between prices and the quantity of money,</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh in chapter 21, Keynes also noted that the Phillips curve is vertical during hyperinflations but I won&#8217;t look up the paragraph.</p>
<p>chapter 21 section VI third paragraph from last. Keynesian economists were warned and ignored the warning. </p>
<p>Friedman and Phelps didn&#8217;t really go fundamentally beyond Keynes on that one. </p>
<p>3) The Peso problem. Why are mexican peso interest rates higher than US dollar interest rates when the exchange rate is fixed ? Answer, people consider a peso devaluation more probable than a dollar devaluation. One only concludes that one can make useful predictions from a finite data set if one is willing to make assumptions about the distribution of random variables. To assume that all variables are normally distributed is to make a gross mistake. Some, like the Peso dollar exchange rate have distributions so that asymptotic results only tell us what will happen when we are all dead.</p>
<p>OK so 2.5 mysteries resolved before I graduated from junior high school (1973). And since then ? hmmm. </p>
<p>Maybe Hall on how Solow&#8217;s residual is positive when there is an increase in demand if price is greater than marginal cost (competition is imperfect).</p>
<p>Over near the great lakes there was, for a while, great interest in working out the implications of </p>
<p>&#8220;(1) For a time at least, rising prices may delude entrepreneurs into increasing employment beyond the level which maximises their individual profits measured in terms of the product.&#8221; </p>
<p>The General Theory &#8230; Chapter 20 section III paragraph 4. For some reason this is called the Lucas supply function.</p>
<p>Also they worked out at great length the implications of assuming perfect competition and perfect labor and capital markets and technological progress which is often negative and which is not persistent. Last I checked (which was long ago) the idea was that with great effort one could fit some summary statistics. I don&#8217;t think anything mysterious was explained. Actually, I think basically all noticible patterns other than those that fit the PIH (or thePIH with some liquidity constrained households) are anomalies which they will explain asymptotically.</p>
<p>Back near Oceans, there was work on putting some nominal rigidity in dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models. The aim was to show that the assumptions of rational expectations and perfect capital markets didn&#8217;t imply that the market outcome was optimal or that policy was irrelevant. When I was a graduate student in the very dead sea of saltiness, no one explained to me why this was the aim. It does seem to be a strikingly irrelevant project at the moment doesn&#8217;t it ?</p>
<p>The line isn&#8217;t &#8220;if you accept these assumptions, then this mystery is resolved&#8221; but rather &#8220;you must make these assumptions so this fact which seems totally unsurprising to you is a mystery.&#8221;</p>
<p>update:  Thanks to a suggestion by Rob in comments, another possible case of actual explanation</p>
<p>An idea which explains things might be the dynamic inconsistency of optimal monetary policy (Kydland and Prescott).  The strange facts that it explains include the moralistic, almost religious, tone of support for tight monetary policy.  I&#8217;m not really sure how new the idea was, but someone I know says he personally knows that K and P were surprised by the mathematical result.  Then a related idea is that it can be rational to delegate monetary policy making to an anti inflation zealot.  This helps explain why apparently  sane people appoint apparently insane people as central bankers (I think the argument is due to Runkle).</p>
