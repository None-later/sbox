<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/apr/05/useconomy-regulators">The Guardian</a> reports that Elizabeth Warren will be recommending startling actions.  Any confirmation?</p>
<blockquote><p>Elizabeth Warren, chief watchdog of America&#8217;s $700bn (£472bn) bank bailout plan, will this week call for the removal of top executives from Citigroup, AIG and other institutions that have received government funds in a damning report that will question the administration&#8217;s approach to saving the financial system from collapse. </p>
<p>Warren, a Harvard law professor and chair of the congressional oversight committee monitoring the government&#8217;s Troubled Asset Relief Program (Tarp), is also set to call for shareholders in those institutions to be &#8220;wiped out&#8221;. &#8220;It is crucial for these things to happen,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Japan tried to avoid them and just offered subsidy with little or no consequences for management or equity investors, and this is why Japan suffered a lost decade.&#8221; She declined to give more detail but confirmed that she would refer to insurance group AIG, which has received $173bn in bailout money, and banking giant Citigroup, which has had $45bn in funds and more than $316bn of loan guarantees. </p>
<p>Warren also believes there are &#8220;dangers inherent&#8221; in the approach taken by treasury secretary Tim Geithner, who she says has offered &#8220;open-ended subsidies&#8221; to some of the world&#8217;s biggest financial institutions without adequately weighing potential pitfalls. &#8220;We want to ensure that the treasury gives the public an alternative approach,&#8221; she said, adding that she was worried that banks would not recover while they were being fed subsidies. &#8220;When are they going to say, enough?&#8221; she said. </p>
<p>She said she did not want to be too hard on Geithner but that he must address the issues in the report. &#8220;The very notion that anyone would infuse money into a financially troubled entity without demanding changes in management is preposterous.&#8221;</p>
<p>The report will also look at how earlier crises were overcome &#8211; the Swedish and Japanese problems of the 1990s, the US savings and loan crisis of the 1980s and the 30s Depression. &#8220;Three things had to happen,&#8221; Warren said. &#8220;Firstly, the banks must have confidence that the valuation of the troubled assets in question is accurate; then the management of the institutions receiving subsidies from the government must be replaced; and thirdly, the equity investors are always wiped out.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-poll-ncpssm-americans-support.html">New poll: NCPSSM: Americans Support Protecting Social Security Benefits</a>. Andrew Biggs links us to good news for those supporters of Social Security who oppose addressing the problem through benefit cuts. He comments on this and rightly points out that the poll is expressly limited to Boomers and current retirees, but still issues a caution to the benefit cuts first crowd.<br />
<blockquote>The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare released the results of a new poll of Baby Boomers and older Americans regarding the future of Social Security. While the results show greater concern for Social Security&#8217;s future than the National Committee generally projects – 14 percent say it is in crisis and an additional 49 percent say it has major problems, while the National Committee tends to downplay the problem – nevertheless the results regarding policy solutions appear favorable to the left.</p>
<p>The survey asked, &#8220;Which of these four ways to insure the future of Social Security would you be most in favor of?&#8221;</p>
<p>Raise the earnings cap on wages subject to payroll taxes: 31%<br />Expand funding sources to include federal income and estate taxes: 27%<br />Raise the retirement age: 14%<br />Reduce benefits for future retirees: 6%<br />Don&#8217;t know or refused: 22%<br />While I would have phrased the questions differently – I have seen polls showing that progressive benefit reductions rank higher than all policy options other than increasing the wage cap – and would have included younger respondents, who are most likely to be affected by Social Security reform, these results do pose a challenge to those who would wish to fix Social Security finances entirely on the benefit end.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have put my comment to Biggs&#8217; post below the fold, but first let me make some observations. First Boomers by and large are not buying into benefit cut based solutions. At least not before some combination of raising the cap or using income or estate tax revenue which in practice means taxing people in the top two quintiles (58% vs 20%). Given that for at least the next two decades this combination of Boomers and their elders are a very powerful political force simply by their propensity to vote this presents an uphill challenge to reformers, there still being some juice in the Third Rail of American Politics. Second I suspect they would have been more open to this in the mid 90&#8217;s when the date of projected Trust Fund Depletion was getting ever closer and ultimately back to 2029, which is the point of maximum Boomer impact on Social Security. Now that TF Depletion has moved to 2041 a combination of using a calender and a calculator and the mortality tables shows that on this topic for this demographic the Fierce Urgency of Now has dissipated.</p>
<p>More importantly that move from TF depletion in 2029 to 2041 equally changes the calender for Gen-X, benefit cut proposals that originated when their impact would fall on Boomers starting retirement are losing their force as the heaviest incidence starts falling on Gen-X instead.</p>
<p>Bruce to Andrew:<br />
<blockquote>Yes I think the challenge for reformers is that they view &#8216;crisis&#8217;  amongst themselves as one of sustainability which is largely defined as minimizing claims on the General Fund going forward. This builds in the somewhat silent assumption that the response to TF Depletion in 2041 will be demands that benefits be kept at the current schedule come what may. Which requires the premise that retirees at that time will have the political clout to make that happen.</p>
<p>This narrative made perfect sense in the early 90s when it appeared that Trust Fund depletion would coincide with the period of peak impact of Boomers on the system. That is under projections that TF depletion would come around 2029 Boomers would be aged from 65 to 83. At that point the mortality tables suggest that half of the oldest Boomers would still be alive and voting with that percentage going up as you moved down through the cohort. This dovetailed with a prevailing popular image of the Boomers being naturally selfish, the &#8216;Me Generation&#8217; (subject of a bazillion magazine cover stories) and an understanding that seniors tend to vote at higher rates. The combination of selfishness and voting demographics was thought to be powerful enough to just swamp the Gen-Xers push back. Moreover this basic narrative was supplemented by one that holds that taxes will have to be increased at the time of TF shortfall or programs slashed  to pay for Boomer Retirement only to see Social Security go &#8216;bankrupt&#8217; or &#8216;flat broke&#8217; at TF depletion which younger workers have translated into &#8216;No check for me&#8217;.</p>
<p>And this isn&#8217;t just theoretical. I have been blog commenting on this since there first were political blogs and the sense of resentment from younger workers is palpable, they really do believe they are going to get screwed two ways, paying extra taxes first and then getting nothing latter.</p>
<p>Under this scenario a reform proposal that included some immediate package of benefit cuts and tax increases that could be phased in in time to make the Selfish Boomers share the pain while making sure that some benefits would be in place for Gen-X made sense. If we were still sitting in 1994 watching the solvency of the TF erode in the way it was.</p>
<p>But by 2000 the calculus had changed considerably. Instead of the TF projecting to go to depletion at the point of maximum Boomer impact on Social Security and the ballot box it was now set for 2037 when Boomers would be aged 73 to 91. Moreover this meant that just about half of Gen-X would be eligible for benefits themselves. Under these circumstances a policy of starting phased in benefit cuts in 2009 largely gives Boomers a pass (it being accepted dogma among reformers that people in retirement or approaching it should not have their retirement options curtailed when they don&#8217;t have an opportunity to build up their PRAs in time) while guaranteeing that Gen-X gets their baseline benefit cut. In effect they are being asked to gore their own ox. And this became even more true as TF depletion pushed out from 2037 to 2041 over Bush&#8217;s first term.</p>
<p>Now given that crisis at TF depletion is really just a matter of taking a smaller benefit in 2042 than some of these Gen-X retirees were getting in 2040, and that <s>timing and needed cut</s> <i>the timing and size of the needed cut</i> being contingent of actual economic performance, it might not be as bad as expected, selling an across the board guaranteed cut in benefits offset by whatever gains you would get from your PRA (after clawback) naturally gets harder to sell.</p>
<p>After all for workers making under the median &#8216;crisis&#8217; is defined as a future benefit cut. Arguments that lifting the cap wouldn&#8217;t backfill the entire gap lose their power when those workers realize that the rest of the gap will require benefit cuts anyway. Nor are they likely to be moved by arguments that crisis should be measured not by TF balances but instead by the time transfers from the General Fund need to start. After all the General Fund is mostly funded by a tax that many of them (and particularly those with children) don&#8217;t have to pay to start with.</p>
<p>So yes indeed the &#8216;benefit end&#8217; only people really do have a challenge. They have been hemmed in by the calender calculus.</p></blockquote>
<p>To which I would add that this largely explains why the reformers are still trying to make the argument that now is the time to move on creating a bi-partisan commission. Because the calender continues to work against them. It has pretty been the consensus among reformers right since 1983 that it would be unfair to cut benefits for people in retirement or approaching it because those people simply don&#8217;t have time to replace that income via a new Personal Retirement Account system. Instead benefit cuts should be restricted to those eight or more years from full retirement age and even then phased in. For example a change in calculating initial benefits from real wage to price increase doesn&#8217;t effect anyone actually drawing benefits, their check being adjusted to prices already. Similarly a shift from shifting from CPI to some measure taking into account a lower price for the typical basket of goods for seniors has a very modest effect over the first decade or two but starts to bite deep as the decades go on. And by that time most Boomers will have shuffled off to Buffalo and points beyond (or up and down depending on your belief system).</p>
<p>Every year that reformers fail to sell their message that we have to start with benefit cuts is a year when Gen-X is being invited to shoot themselves in the foot while giving Boomers a pass. In 2009 if Social Security is left alone &#8216;crisis&#8217; will be defined as a cut in benefits in 2041. If we define Gen-X as the eighteen year cohort of people born 1965 to 1983 (and it doesn&#8217;t matter what we call them) we are talking about people currently aged 26 to 44 who will be 58 to 76 in 2041. Meaning that a phased in benefit cut now or an increase in retirement guarantees at least half of them being absolute losers in their first years of retirement. Whereas an increase in taxes via a cap increase or a cross the board payroll tax increase simply means that people making over the median and particularly people earning over the cap have to divert funds from other retirement options. And the calculus only gets tighter as the years go on. Reformers who think they can just bide their time until some hypothetical Republican electoral sweep in 2012 or 2016 need to check their calenders. Gen-Xers then being all that closer to that key date of being 50, a point when people realistically can estimate their retirement outcomes and more mindful of what a repeat of a 2008-2010 event would have on their retirement fund.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/">Hilzoy</a> has a way with words.  And sometimes she nails complex ideas concisely, clearly, and incredibly to the point.  I think <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_04/017605.php">this</a> could be a manifesto of sorts for much of the center-left in this country:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like a lot of conservatives, I am very worried about the deficits. Unlike some of them, I was also worried about it several years ago.  Also unlike them, I am at present more worried about getting out of the recession, and I am willing to run deficits in the short run to accomplish that. But because I am worried about the deficit, I want these deficits to be well targeted and stimulative.</p>
<p>That means that I am much, much happier about spending money on investments that will pay dividends into the future, or on like deferred maintenance that we will need to do eventually, than on things we don&#8217;t need, like the war in Iraq. It also means that I think that any tax cuts we pass now ought to go to people who will actually spend all the money they get, rather than to people who will not: i.e., the rich.</p>
<p>Spending money on things we need tends to be a better stimulus than tax cuts. Tax cuts for the poor and middle class tend to be better stimuli than tax cuts for the rich. </p></blockquote>
<p>But because conservatives can also write manifestos, I would add one a paragraph to make it clear this is more than opinion pulled out of the air:</p>
<p>We know this because we&#8217;ve learned from history.  We&#8217;ve seen it all before.  We&#8217;ve had administrations that cut taxes.  We&#8217;ve had administrations that raised taxes.  We&#8217;ve had administrations that targeted tax cuts on the poor, and we&#8217;ve had administrations that targeted tax cuts on the wealthy.  We&#8217;ve had administrations that focused spending on things we&#8217;ve needed, and administrations that focused spending on things we didn&#8217;t.  In fact, just about every administration we&#8217;ve had since National Accounts have been tracked beginning in the 1930s has engaged in all of the above to some degree or other.  But there are degrees, and liberals and conservatives have different champions.  And  the historical has been clear and unambiguous to anyone who will do the math.  Reagan, the conservative champion, and all other conservative presidents, turned in lower <a href="http://bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=253&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2008&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaBox=no#Mid">growth rates</a> than liberals like FDR, LBJ, JFK, and Clinton.<br />________________________________<br />by cactus (updated)</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I consider plain old mortgage bonds (MBS) the last clearly socially useful innovative financial product.  Here I will argue contra MBS basically in an attempt to understand Krugman&#8217;s not so recent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/27/opinion/27krugman.html?scp=1&#038;sq=krugman%20mystique&#038;st=cse">root and branch denunciation of securitization</a>.</p>
<p>First the case for the original MBS (which I actually believe).  Securitized claims on the cash flow from mortgages make it possible to diversify regional risk.  Banks mortgage portfolio&#8217;s are concentrated geographically, so, without securitization, a local down turn can bankrupt a local bank.  There is no need for anyone to bear this risk &#8212; it can be diversified away.</p>
<p>So what could be wrong with this argument ?  I try to counter argue after the jump.</p>
<p>1. Banks will go bankrupt.  If the risk of bankruptcy is zero, bank managers and shareholders can do better by taking a bearing a little more risk.  This is like the principle that, if you have never missed an airplane, you are going to the airport too soon (a view expressed by one Lawrence Summers).</p>
<p>For the rest of us, it is vital that they not all go bankrupt at once.  This means that we should force banks to bear idiosyncratic risk.  If they can hedge all idiosyncratic risk, then they will bear systemic risk until we have a total collapse every few decades.  </p>
<p>2. There will be real estate bubbles that burst.  If the system is protected from local bubbles (&#8220;froth&#8221; according to Greenspan) then there will be a national bubble.  Financial innovation made it safe to loan so long as national average home prices didn&#8217;t collapse.  Bankers believed (or pretended to believe until they received their bonus checks) that such a collapse was impossible, because it had never happened before (not counting the great depression which happened so long ago that it never happened).  This made a national bubble and national collapse necessary.</p>
<p>Both 1 and 2 argue that there is conservation of risk.  Any risk diversification strategy will lead to more leverage and equal risk.  The good old fashion diversifiable risk is costly, but less socially costly that common risk.  Improved risk management (really genuine improved risk management which, other things equal would really reduce risk) is therefore socially undesirable.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not convinced, but the argument isn&#8217;t crazy.</p>

                                <p>Suppose I told you that there was a crisis with a stock, say, GE.  That the price of the stock had dropped <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=GE&#038;t=1y&#038;l=on&#038;z=m&#038;q=l&#038;c=">around 75% in the past year</a>.  And you responded, &#8220;But the problem is solved; the prices of long-term Call Options (say, <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=GE&#038;m=2011-01">the January 2011 20s</a>) has gone up, as has their Open Interest.</p>
<p>You will (rightly) point out that this won&#8217;t revitalise the assets themselves and I will (rightly) note that option markets rather saved the equity markets in 1987, for instance.  You will note that I am too optimistic, and I will agree, holding up a <a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/03/tim-geithner-is-not-a-tool-of-wall-street.html">Brad</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/03/matthew-richardson-and-nouriel-roubini.html">DeLong</a> mask (since I&#8217;d rather have DeLong&#8217;s [relative to mine] abundant hair than Geithner&#8217;s abundant forehead).</p>
<p>Then I will drop the other shoe and say that the toxic (&#8220;legacy&#8221;) assets should be priced as if the Fed-supported trades were options, with the underlying current price worked out by Black-Scholes. (As I&#8217;ve noted before, B-S is specifically <strong>IN</strong>appropriate for this exercise, as it will overvalue the option. And therefore anyone suggesting the toxic [&#8220;legacy&#8221;] assets should be priced—or carried on their books—at a level higher than that model will clearly be insane.)</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to The TARP Solution.  Details beneath the fold.</p>
<p>TARP is the Treasury Department&#8217;s attempt to confront two realities: (1) it isn&#8217;t a &#8220;market&#8221; in any reasonable sense of the word if the Fed is putting up 85% of the cash. (People who tell us that this means firms are committing a &#8220;large amount&#8221; to the process either do not understand the English language,or are <a target="_blank" href="http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2009/04/little-bit-of-careful-thinking-and-why.html">hedge fund managers trying to sell something</a>.)  So let&#8217;s put some random numbers together.</p>
<p>Those &#8220;legacy&#8221; assets are trading in the market around 30.  The Big C and others are carrying them on their books around 80.  Several people who should know better (Summers, Geithner, DeLong) have conflated &#8220;the market is underpricing the assets&#8221; with &#8220;the true price of the assets will make the banks solvent again.&#8221;*</p>
<p>So we know three things.  (1) People are willing to pay 30% of their own money to buy these assets, (2) the Fed is only requiring them to pay 15%, and (3) the fair value is between 30 (the current market price) and 80, and probably closer to the former than the later.</p>
<p>So again, using back-of-the-envelope principles, let&#8217;s pretend that we think the recovery will be soon, that the defaults will slow (or at least that resales will be quick and frictionless), and that the market reaches that consensus quickly.  And so fair value should be around 50.**</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s say the Fed offers to buy a MBS for 50.  How, as an investor, do I make money off this?  Three possible ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I own securities for which I paid </li>
<li>If I own securities for which I paid >50, and which I cannot sell for 50 without revealing myself to be insolvent, I buy securities at 50 along with the Fed and &#8220;average in.&#8221;  (This is the &#8220;how to stay solvent longer than the market can be rational&#8221; act.)</li>
<li>If the Fed is buying securities at 50 so that I can no longer buy them at 30—I buy a LONG-dated Call Option on the security.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is that last that explains TARP. Effectively, the co-investors with the Fed will be buying a Call option at 7.5 on the security at 50.***</p>
<p>Of course, it may not be an at-the-money Call option.  More likely, the hedge fund effectively will be buying an out-of-the-money option (say, a 49.5 Call for 8) where some portion of the purchase is put up by the government.</p>
<p>Now you will note that, technically, TARP requires the hedge fund to buy the asset.  So you might argue that this is not an option.  But let&#8217;s look at the generic payoff diagram to the hedge fund of the two scenarios.
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Sdlq9tDeBdI/AAAAAAAAARY/L5WRVc8T6Xw/s1600-h/tarp+v+call.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Sdlq9tDeBdI/AAAAAAAAARY/L5WRVc8T6Xw/s400/tarp+v+call.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Amazingly, you can&#8217;t tell the difference on the payoff diagram as the security gains.****  In both cases, the hedge fund manager has just gone long volatility.</p>
<p>Expect that to have a ripple effect—I&#8217;m guessing dampening, cet. par.—on other option volatility trades.</p>
<p>All that is left is to back out what actual value of the security was assumed by the hedge fund when they bought the option.  Which I will also leave as an exercise to the reader, while suggesting that a fair indication is min[x, TotalFedContribution] s.t. x a.s. approaches TotalFedContribution.</p>
<p>Will this bring the markets back, or make bank balance sheets more stable? I&#8217;m still saying &#8220;No,&#8221; and hoping to be proved wrong.</p>
<p>But what it should do is reduce volatility buying, especially in the other debt markets, for the foreseeable future.  So if any of those <s>Bankrupt</s> &#8220;legacy asset constrained&#8221; institutions has a long volatility position, there will be even more &#8220;Unintended Consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>*In fairness to Brad DeLong, I don&#8217;t believe he believes this. As <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2009/03/politics-is-weird.html">Dr. Black noted</a>, George Voinovich &#8220;wants to see a pile of money in flames before he&#8217;s willing to vote for what&#8217;s necessary,&#8221; and DeLong therefore sees this as a necessary evil.  Having seen no evidence from the Obama Administration that they Have a Clue, I am naturally suspicious that this particular idiocy will do anything other than waste time and money—both of which are in increasingly short supply—but, since Larry Summers has shown <a target="_blank" href="http://thismodernworld.com/4731">his brilliant foresight before</a> and clear has <a target="_blank" href="http://thismodernworld.com/4736">no skin in the game</a>, I am reassured that there is no Principal-Agent problem at work here, as they was when Christopher &#8220;I never saw a regulation I like&#8221; Cox was named head of the SEC by the Previous Administration.</p>
<p>**While we&#8217;re at it, can we pretend that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&#038;search-type=ss&#038;index=books&#038;field-author=Amber%20Benson">Amber Benson</a> will be my next wife, which is probably very little less likely than those other possibilities (especially since I&#8217;m already married to an sf-writing actress/director)?  (Amazingly, even without those conditions, we would be using a BotE number of 50: though there is a legitimate argument that 60 would be easier to work with, I&#8217;m assuming no one is that stupid.)</p>
<p>***This is why 60 would have been easier; 15% of 60 is 9, so I wouldn&#8217;t have to pay attention to decimal places.  40 would also have been easier—and both certainly more realistic than 60 and arguably more realistic than 50, but I want to maintain the pretense of the U.S. Treasury that this is a liquidity, not a solvency, crisis.  (They&#8217;re wrong, but it&#8217;s their game.)</p>
<p>****The reason we can tell the difference on the losses is the possibility that the hedge fund treats the position as if it were an in-the-money Call option for which the Fed paid the in-the-money portion; the real returns to the hedge fund of the position in a TARP security are the same in both cases; there would be differences in the way the rest of the portfolio was managed, though, which are left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

<p>Articles this week by Kevin Hassett and Lori Montgomery sought to make the claim that deficits scheduled for 2017 had been moved up to today as a reason to immediately convene a bi-partisan Commission to Reform Social Security (with &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; meaning dominated by Blue Dog Dems and Conservative Republicans). Well first of all Social Security surpluses don&#8217;t disappear in 2017, at least &#8216;surplus&#8217; as defined by CBO and second of all it really doesn&#8217;t matter that cash surpluses (Income excluding Interest) are projected to fall behind cost in that year. Understanding why requires some understanding of how Social Security manages the Trust Funds. The following shows assets in the OASI Trust Fund at year end 2006 and 2007 (the latest data available). Click on the image to get an enlarged version.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjQj4NL9rI/AAAAAAAAAJE/SDfH8ZDHgDw/s1600-h/OASDI.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjQj4NL9rI/AAAAAAAAAJE/SDfH8ZDHgDw/s400/OASDI.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Discussion below the fold.</p>
<p>Generally when talking about Social Security we talk about THE Social Security Trust Fund having a current balance of $2.4 trillion and a shortfall date of 2017, a depletion date of 2041 and a payroll gap of 1.7%. And this includes the Trustees, most of the Tables in the Annual Reports talking about the OASDI Trust Fund. But in law and in actual operation there is no such thing as an OASDI Trust Fund, instead there is an OASI Trust Fund for the Old Age/Survivors Insurance program and a totally separate DI Trust Fund for the Disability Insurance program. Which means among other things that each Trust Fund has different dates for shortfall and depletion and different payroll gaps. Moreover they have different degrees of uncertainty, the range of outcomes for DI being much wider than that of OAS. Plus DI is much smaller being about 10% of the size of OAS. All of this has some implications for policy, which I will describe in a later post.  (In fact until I took a closer look at the following figure I didn&#8217;t realize how big those implications were.)<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjW7gVkCkI/AAAAAAAAAJM/9FBvyBvicH8/s1600-h/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdjW7gVkCkI/AAAAAAAAAJM/9FBvyBvicH8/s400/OAS+and+DI+long+term+ratios.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />But for now I want to concentrate on the assets in and the interest on the OAS Trust Fund. The Trustees explain it like this.<br />
<blockquote>Another source of income to the trust funds is interest received on investments held by the trust funds. That portion of each trust fund which is not required to meet the current cost of benefits and administration is invested, on a daily basis, primarily in interest-bearing obligations of the U.S. Government (including special public-debt obligations described below). Investments may also be made in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States, including certain Federally sponsored agency obligations that are designated in the laws authorizing their issuance as lawful investments for fiduciary and trust funds under the control and authority of the United States or any officer of the United States. These obligations may be acquired on original issue at the issue price or by purchase of outstanding obligations at their market price. <br />The Social Security Act authorizes the issuance of special public-debt obligations for purchase exclusively by the trust funds. The Act provides that the interest rate on new special obligations will be the average market yield, as of the last business day of a month, on all of the outstanding marketable U.S. obligations that are due or callable more than 4 years in the future. The rate so calculated is rounded to the nearest one-eighth of one percent and applies to new issues in the following month. Beginning January 1999, in calculating the average market yield rate for this purpose, the Treasury incorporates the yield to the call date when a callable bond’s market price is above par.<br />Although the special issues cannot be bought or sold in the open market, <u>they are nonetheless redeemable at any time at par value and thus bear no risk of fluctuations in principal value due to changes in market yield rates</u>. Just as in the case of marketable Treasury securities held by the public, all of the investments held by the trust funds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government.</p></blockquote>
<p>The first thing to note is that the Trust Fund is not a unitary account subject to the current interest rate. Instead it is a portfolio of specific certificates and bonds with specific rates and maturity dates.  As noted by the Trustees the bonds are not affected by current interest rates, the $27 billion in 2009  bonds yielding 7.25% are going to add $1.95 billion to the Trust Fund no matter what happens to rates this year. Meaning the total portfolio is going to add interest to the TF of around $110 billion. At year end the OAS Trust Fund will have a net increase in assets over the year, that  people don&#8217;t want to call that increase a &#8216;surplus&#8217; is their problem.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that the Trust Funds are immune to changes in current interest rates, the higher yields of the bonds maturing in 2009 will be replaced by new lower yielding ones, but this only effects a fraction of the portfolio. If we examine the Table we can see that the $290 billion in new issues in 2007 have yields of 5.0%. About a third of that represented by new issues due to interest, a third on rolling over maturing bonds earning less than 5.0% (though not by much) and a third rolling over maturing bonds earning more than 5.0%, the total effect was a near wash. The 2008 Report will likely see a bigger effect and the 2009 even more on projected balances but those $290 billion in 2007 issues will continue to yield 5% until their respective maturity dates.</p>
<p>Which leads us to 2017. Currently the dollar amounts of cash surpluses (tax revenue over total cost) are dropping even faster than projected and on the OAS side may be down by half or more. Which may move the date that those cash surpluses vanish up from 2017, but if OMB and CBO are right not by much, and in any case the total increase in assets that year will be more than $200 billion and probably pretty close to the $243 billion projected by CBO last August. Now under current projection none of this increase will be the result of excess contributions from FICA which will fall $24 billion below the amount needed to cover projected cost. All of it will be due to interest earned on the portfolio, which has led some to argue that the response of Congress will just be to punt the ball down the field by cutting benefits rather than having to cut spending or increase borrowing or taxes on the General Fund side. But this ignores the fact that there will be specific bond issues maturing in 2017 including $77.3 billion yielding 5.250%. Now some in Congress will take a lead from Hassett and AEI and claim that we shouldn&#8217;t count interest on the Trust Fund as real, but they are going to have a lot harder time saying the same thing about the maturing principal. Now not all of that $77.3 billion was the result of excess FICA taxes, up to half of it comprised of interest earned on the portfolio at the time of the issue of the bond. Meaning they are put in the position of issuing new Special Treasuries to roll over that $77.3 billion, insisting they are still fully backed by Full Faith and Credit while denying they have the cash to even pay down some of the maturing principal.</p>
<p>Sitting here in 2009 and thinking about the Trust Fund as a unified whole where 2017 marks the time you start drawing on interest and having exhausted that start drawing on principal in 2023 is to ignore the operational reality of the Trust Fund. In actual practice a portion of that principal comes to maturity every year and has to be either redeemed or rolled over. If we examine the right hand (2007) column we can see that every dash represents a bond issue that has been retired and replaced by a new Special Treasury, in doing so the Treasury has shown it still stands behind Full Faith and Credit. But the instant it refuses to recognize a valid claim for repayment of the portion of the bond that represents actual excess contributions they have effectively abrogated the entire Trust Fund. You can play fancy games with accrued interest and insist that it shouldn&#8217;t count, but you have a lot harder time doing that with maturing principal.</p>
<p>Only if you regard the Trust Fund as an undifferentiated lump where no principal payment is due until 2023 is it possible to sell the idea that the date that Income excluding Interest falling behind Total Cost is significant. But in practice we redeem some of the principal every year even now. Back in the late eighties there was hardly a suggestion that Shortfall was a significant date, main because Trust Fund depletion was reasonably close and coming closer. And Trust Fund depletion had real fall-out, it presented the direct tradeoff of either just taking a benefit cut or increasing taxes. And when and if we get fifteen years from projected depletion we will be able to make a good faith argument that something needs to be done, the looming benefit cut coming not from a failure to stand behind Full Faith and Credit, indeed the whole concept of Trust Fund Depletion assumes that Full Faith operates all the way down just as it did in the late seventies.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a>. In 1971 Social Security went to Shortfall as tax revenues fell below cost. Our response? We honored the interest and maintained full benefits. In 1975 Social Security hit &#8216;peak&#8217; as all accrued interest was needed to pay benefits and we were no longer able to just roll over the principal. Our response? We honored the remaining interest and the principal and maintained the necessary transfers from the General Fund needed to pay benefit. Plus we put in place the Carter 1977 Amendment which pushed the problem out by 50 years. Unfortunately it didn&#8217;t totally work and by 1982 Trust Fund depletion was imminent. Which led to the 1983 Reform which required a combination of tax increases and benefit cuts. But at no point did anyone suggest that somehow the interest and principal in the Trust Funds were not a real and binding obligation.</p>
<p>2017 doesn&#8217;t matter because the people who insist it does are making a dishonest argument that implicitly claims that Full Faith and Credit is something selective and elective, and that Congress can effectively wave it away by legislative action, and claim that a Supreme Court ruling that people don&#8217;t have ownership rights to the Trust Funds supports that. Well I don&#8217;t think that is what the Court really had in mind. That Congress is free to change the benefit schedule in response to Trust Fund balances dropping below acceptable ratios (i.e. current law sets a trigger at a TF ratio of 100) does not mean they are free to simply change it out of an attempt to avoid payment when that TF ratio is projected to be at 385 by effectively denying that legally owed interest falls under Full Faith and Credit. That claim may survive encounter with the Courts, but I don&#8217;t think it survives its encounter with the ballot box. I just don&#8217;t see &#8220;Yes you have $4.4 trillion in the bank, and yes it is earning interest, but no you are not allowed to actually draw on it&#8221; as a winning argument in the 2018 mid-terms.</p>
<p>Basically AEI is hoping to pull a fast one before anyone notices what their plan actually does. </p>

<p>Salon has a short note and a voting widget for whether newspapers should charge for on-line content as a way to increase revenue and I assume stay in business as part of a conversational piece.<a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/tech/giga_om/tech_insider/2009/04/03/open_thread_should_newspapers_charge_for_online_content/index.html">Charging for on-line information</a>.</p>
<p>Locally, whether the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/04/05/threat_to_globe_triggers_flood_of_feelings/">Boston Globe stays in business</a> is a major concern.  Also, it is also an example of how the distribution of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.boston.com/ae/media/articles/2009/04/05/union_employees_open_to_concessions_but_demand_management_cuts_as_well/">&#8216;needed sacrifice&#8217;</a> is being played out so far.</p>
<p>(This gave me an idea that I might pursue.  How does the stimulus impact local school systems, and how are decisions made depending on the management philosophy of a particular system.  Usually we follow private companies&#8230;perhaps it is time to look at a significant portion of dollars spent in the public sector.</p>
<p>Certainly the series on TBI and PTSD became valuable from an &#8216;economics&#8217; point of view as well.)</p>

<p>A quick reminder with no analysis for a Sunday afternoon on greed is good meme:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_of_Credit_and_Commerce_International">Wikipedia</a> provides a memory jog for twenty years ago.  </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI)</strong> was a major international bank founded in Karachi, Pakistan in 1972 by Agha Hasan Abedi, a Pakistani financier. The company was registered in Luxembourg. At its peak, it operated in 78 countries, had over 400 branches, and had assets in excess of US$ 20 billion making it the 7th largest private bank in the world by assets.[1][2]</p>
<p>BCCI came under the radar of regulatory bodies and intelligence agencies in the 1980s due to its perceived avoidance of falling under one regulatory banking authority. A fact that was later,after extensive investigations, proven to be true. BCCI became the focus of a massive regulatory battle in 1991 and was described as a &#8220;$20-billion-plus heist&#8221;.</p>
<p>Investigators in the U.S. and the UK revealed that BCCI had been &#8220;set up deliberately to avoid centralized regulatory review, and operated extensively in bank secrecy jurisdictions. Its affairs were extraordinarily complex. Its officers were sophisticated international bankers whose apparent objective was to keep their affairs secret, to commit fraud on a massive scale, and to avoid detection.&#8221; BCCI organized its own intelligence network, diplomatic corps and shipping &#038; trading companies.</p>
<p>The liquidators, Deloitte &#038; Touche, filed a lawsuit against Price Waterhouse and Ernst &#038; Young &#8211; the bank&#8217;s auditors &#8211; which was settled for $175 million in 1998. A further lawsuit against the Emir of Abu Dhabi, a major shareholder, was launched in 1999 for approximately $400 million. BCCI creditors also instituted a $1 billion suit against the Bank of England as a regulatory body. After a nine-year struggle, due to the Bank&#8217;s statutory immunity, the case went to trial in January 2004. However, in November 2005, Deloitte dropped its action against the Bank of England as contrary to creditors&#8217; interests.[citation needed][vague][which?] To date liquidators have recovered about 90% of the creditors&#8217; lost money.[3]</p></blockquote>

<p>What is now the top line is total government debt.  The bottom line in Publicly-Held Government Debt.  <s>The lines become bold as of</s>There is now a dividing line at FY 1984, which began  <s>the year</s> after the Greenspan Commission put a regressive tax on low- and mid-level wage earners which was supposed to prefund their (our) retirement needs.</p>
<p>The difference between the two lines is the money that has been contributed to the Social Security Trust Fund in order to &#8220;save&#8221; it.*</p>
<p>*The Greenspan Commission was clear on this, requiring that, as of 1993, the President&#8217;s Budget Proposal note both the real (i.e., ex-SocSec overpayment) deficit as well as the nominal one, precisely <em>because</em> they did not want the system to be gamed.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>As Krugman would say: Wonkish. Last Wednesday I put up a post <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-tactics-in-old-war-vanishing-social.html">Vanishing the Social Security Surplus</a> which got some push back in comments by Andrew Biggs. So let me back up a little.</p>
<p>Social Security surplus is defined in two ways. One is &#8216;Income less Interest &#8211; Cost&#8217;. The other is more simply &#8216;Income &#8211; Cost&#8217;. I would argue that the standard definition is the latter and would support it two ways. First the Social Security Trustees implicitly define it as the second, for example we could examine Table Vi.C6 from the 2008 Report.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcFlv3w14I/AAAAAAAAAIM/o7zUtbpN2y4/s1600-h/2008-Table-VI.C6.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcFlv3w14I/AAAAAAAAAIM/o7zUtbpN2y4/s400/2008-Table-VI.C6.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Note that there is no column corresponding to &#8216;Income less Interest &#8211; Cost&#8217;, you have to derive it. On the other hand there is a column equating to &#8216;Income &#8211; Cost&#8217; which is labeled &#8216;Net increase during the Year&#8217;. Now the Trustees don&#8217;t label this as &#8216;Surplus&#8217; but there is little doubt that most people think of it as such, generally the current Trust Fund balance of $2.4 trillion is thought of as an accumulation of &#8216;surpluses&#8217;. Indeed a lot of people on both sides of the debate insist that the government &#8216;borrowed&#8217; (or alternatively &#8216;stole&#8217; &#8216;spent&#8217; &#8216;diverted&#8217;) all of the Trust Fund balance to other uses over the years. As we will see this is not right but back to the point.</p>
<p>It is perfectly clear that CBO is not so reticent. They clearly equate Income &#8211; Cost as equalling &#8216;Surplus&#8217;. For example in their August 2008 Report <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/89xx/doc8917/01-23-2008_BudgetOutlook.pdf">The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2008 to 2018</a> they put it as follows: <br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcM1ScoNWI/AAAAAAAAAIU/W4NGC0FgB5E/s1600-h/CBO-Aug-2008-Table-1.1.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcM1ScoNWI/AAAAAAAAAIU/W4NGC0FgB5E/s400/CBO-Aug-2008-Table-1.1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />So total Unified Budget surplus/deficit is defined as the combination of on-budget surplus/deficit and off-budget surplus/deficit. And for all practical purposes  off-budget surplus equates to Social Security surplus. Meaning  there is a practical equation between &#8216;off-budget surplus&#8217; and &#8216;social security surplus&#8217; and &#8216;net increase during the year&#8217; and &#8216;income (including interest) &#8211; cost&#8217;. For budgeting purposes they are all the same.  And an examination of SSA&#8217;s Table  VI.C6 shows that by 2017 all of that surplus is comprised of interest on the Trust Fund.</p>
<p>Now in an article on Tuesday in the WaPo by Lori Montgomery titled called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/30/AR2009033003291.html">Recession Puts a Major Strain On Social Security Trust Fund</a> we get the following claim:<br />
<blockquote>Last August, the CBO predicted that surplus would exceed $80 billion this year and next, then rise to around $90 billion before slowly evaporating by 2020. But the rapidly deteriorating economy &#8212; particularly the loss of more than 4 million jobs &#8212; has driven those numbers much lower much faster, with the surplus expected to hit $16 billion this year and only $3 billion next year, then vanish entirely by 2017.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh? CBO in August 2008 predicted a Socials Security surplus in 2009 of  $199 billion and in 2010 of $210 billion. And far from evaporating by 2020 showed a surplus of $253 billion in 2017.  SSA has somewhat lower numbers or 2017 at $213 billion and $169 billion by 2020 (Table VI.F8). How do we get from there to $80 billion for 2009 and &#8216;evaporating by 2020&#8217;? Answer is below the fold.<br />(Update. Coberly found the main cause of the problem. Like all 10-year Treasuries interest on the vast bulk of the Trust Fund that is invested in Special Treasuries is payable twice a year in June and December. So the actual monthly Fund Balance Sheet for any other month won&#8217;t show it since it is not yet actually in the Trust Fund, while on the overall SS Balance Sheet it shows up as a receivable and hence as an asset.)</p>
<p>Simple, you just take definition number one for &#8216;surplus&#8217; which is &#8216;income excluding interest &#8211; cost&#8217; and abandon the standard CBO definition of &#8216;income including interest&#8217;. In effect you just assume that the interest on the Trust Fund is just not real, which in turn requires assuming that the principal in the Trust Fund is not a real interest earning obligation of the United States government.</p>
<p>Note that there is no hint in the Montgomery&#8217;s piece that she is using a different definition of &#8216;surplus&#8217; than that in CBO&#8217;s Table 1-1. Plus in order to find the distinction she is stating here you have to go deep into the Report.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcgAOOJuYI/AAAAAAAAAIc/vqL4cy-KBUA/s1600-h/CBO-Aug-SS-Surpluses.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcgAOOJuYI/AAAAAAAAAIc/vqL4cy-KBUA/s400/CBO-Aug-SS-Surpluses.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Given that this is page 121 and the usual standards of the WaPo you don&#8217;t have to be a genius to tell that this is the product of some feeding of Steno Lori by the usual suspects, in this case from AEI.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s have a subtotal. Using the standard definition of &#8216;surplus&#8217; as used by CBO and SSA, that is &#8216;total income excluding cost&#8217; it is clear that it didn&#8217;t vanish in February, the roughly $2.4 trillion TF balance earning interest at a nominal rate of 5.0% was returning around $120 billion which for a short month like February means something like $8 billion. From that accrued interest we would have to subtract any gap between revenue from taxation and cost for the month, amounts that are supplied by Andrew Biggs in his post <a target="_blank" href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2009/03/slowdown-slashes-social-security.html">Slowdown Slashes Social Security Surplus</a>. Biggs introduces us to a new tool from Social Security&#8217;s office of the Chief Actuary which gives us results by month <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/allOps.html">Financial Data for a Selected Time Period</a>. If we punch in Feb 2009 we see OAS with a surplus of $525 million and Di with a deficit of $1.779 billion for a combined deficit of $1.255 billion hence &#8216;vanished surplus&#8217;. Now this number is basically legit in that if you go to the Treasury&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/tfmp/tfmp.htm">Monthly Trust Fund Report</a> and select the OAS January version you find the following results on page 3.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcrVQQU_GI/AAAAAAAAAIs/geMTwD5qPhc/s1600-h/Jan09-OAS+Balance.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcrVQQU_GI/AAAAAAAAAIs/geMTwD5qPhc/s400/Jan09-OAS+Balance.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />And similarly the February<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcrVC_fCVI/AAAAAAAAAIk/0dsi-TEaHX8/s1600-h/Feb09-OAS+balance.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdcrVC_fCVI/AAAAAAAAAIk/0dsi-TEaHX8/s400/Feb09-OAS+balance.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />So the number is legit, we have a TF balance for OAS up from $2,219.314 billion to $2,219.964 billion which is close enough to $525 million not to matter in context. But what are we to make of this?<br />January 2009<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sdcv-_k958I/AAAAAAAAAI0/rfAod9kV8Yg/s1600-h/Jan09-Interest.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sdcv-_k958I/AAAAAAAAAI0/rfAod9kV8Yg/s400/Jan09-Interest.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />February 2009<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sdcv_E9AbCI/AAAAAAAAAI8/7K9XU3Z5gXM/s1600-h/Feb09-Interest.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/Sdcv_E9AbCI/AAAAAAAAAI8/7K9XU3Z5gXM/s400/Feb09-Interest.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />In January the Trust Fund earned $20 million in interest for a total yearly total of $52.978 billion.<br />In February the Trust Fund earned $75 million in interest for a total yearly total of $53.053 billion<br />But we are talking a $2.2 trillion dollar Trust Fund at a nominal 5%, shouldn&#8217;t interest be more like $9 billion a month? Well yes it should. So lets take a look at page five from the same Reports.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHaSpDOhI/AAAAAAAAAHs/_AeGGxs5dUs/s1600-h/OAS-Jan.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHaSpDOhI/AAAAAAAAAHs/_AeGGxs5dUs/s400/OAS-Jan.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHaVRwmGI/AAAAAAAAAH0/cZEddTniJBw/s1600-h/OAS-Feb.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SdPHaVRwmGI/AAAAAAAAAH0/cZEddTniJBw/s400/OAS-Feb.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Whoah! January assets that totalled $2.193 trillion and moved up to February assets of $2.196 trillion on page 3 transform to assets totaling $2.228 for January on page 5 and $2.237 trillion for February. Somehow the approximately $525 million February  surplus for OAS cited by Biggs, admittedly based on totally official information from the Treasury, transforms to a $9 billion surplus between between page 3 and 5 of the same report. And if we repeated the exercise for DI we would see a deficit transform from $1.7 billion to $900 million.</p>
<p>Why the difference? Well it turns on a category called &#8220;Interest Receivable&#8221;. For whatever reason interest accrued on the Trust Fund in January and February of this year was not counted as an asset on page 3 of the monthly TF Report from Treasury or on the Web application of the Office of the Actuary. On the other hand it was so credited on page 5 of the monthly TF Report. Maybe someone with actual accounting skills can explain why we should claim with Biggs, Hassett and Montgomery why Social Security surpluses vanished in February even as assets increased by a net $8 billion dollars. To me that can only be done by claiming that the Trust Funds don&#8217;t really exist and that all excess contributions since 1983 and interest on them should be discounted to zero.</p>
<p>In other words &#8216;sorry suckers! we got the money and we are not paying it back!&#8217;.</p>
<p>(There are a lot of numbers here, if I have missed something please correct me in comments.)</p>
