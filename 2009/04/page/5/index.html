<p>In the course of a post called the <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/04/vanishing-surplus-revealed.html">The Vanishing Surplus-Revealed</a> there arose a semantic dispute about what &#8216;surplus&#8217; means. Well I maintain that the answer to that question is not in authorial intent but instead on audience reception. If you are writing for a popular audience you have an obligation to write in a way that is in accord with their normal understanding. In the course of that discussion I was directed to the following paper by Michael Boskin. But I took away from it totally the opposite message from that of the commenter. (Bolding mine).  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/siepr/cgi-bin/siepr/?q=system/files/shared/pubs/papers/briefs/policybrief_nov04.pdf">Sense and Nonsense About Federal Deficits <br />and Debt</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;To make sense of these issues, economists employ several related measures in addition to the traditional nominal cash budget balance (see Table 1).&#8221;  </p>
<p>Table 1  <br />Alternative Budget Surplus/Deficit Concepts  </p>
<p>1. Unified nominal surplus/deficit = nominal revenues – nominal outlays; “headline” numbers  <br /> 2. Operating surplus/deficit = unified deficit – net investment (public capital investment &#8211; depreciation of public capital)  <br />   3. Primary surplus/deficit = unified deficit – interest outlays on inherited debt  <br />   4. Cyclically adjusted surplus/deficit: unified deficit adjusted to “high employment,” i.e., removes effect (+ and – ) of business cycle on revenues and outlays; i.e., removes effect of “automatic stabilizers”  <br />   5. Standardized surplus/deficit: adjusts unified deficit for business cycle and some other transitory items, e.g., the inflation component of interest, receipts from allies for Desert Storm, deposit insurance outlays for failed S&#038;Ls, that are unlikely to affect real income</p></blockquote>
<p> I would agree with Boskin that when people hear the word &#8216;surplus&#8217; unqualified they will understand it in the &#8216;traditional&#8217; &#8216;headline&#8217; sense, which is to say as a product of the Unified Budget surplus/deficit.</p>
<p>I say this not to just refight the stale battle (though comments are welcome) but instead to take the &#8216;headline&#8217; characterization from Boskin and apply it to debt. What then would &#8216;headline debt&#8217; be? Discussion below the fold</p>
<p>I suggest that when people hear the term &#8216;federal debt&#8217; they normally understand that to be total Public Debt as portrayed on such things as the  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brillig.com/debt_clock/">U.S. National Debt Clock</a> whose most famous version is seen in Times Square. This version summarizes the debt situation as follows<br />
<blockquote>The Outstanding Public Debt as of 15 Apr 2009 at 05:13:40 PM GMT is:  $11,176,896,295,826.53<br />The estimated population of the United States is 306,006,590<br />so each citizen&#8217;s share of this debt is $36,525.02.<br />The National Debt has continued to increase an average of $3.84 billion per day since September 28, 2007!<br />Concerned? Then tell Congress and the White House</p></blockquote>
<p> A search on &#8216;Obama $11 trillion debt&#8217; returns 108,000 hits and many quite literally using this in their headline. For example a CBS online piece from March 17th is quite explicit. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/03/17/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry4872310.shtml">National Debt Hits Record $11 Trillion</a> and reports it as follows:<br />
<blockquote>The Federal Government’s flood of red ink hit another high-water mark as the Treasury Department quietly reported today that the National Debt hit $11-trillion for the first time ever. <br />To be exact, the Debt now stands at $11,033,157,578,669.78. Divide it by the U.S. population and it comes up to over $36,000 in debt for every man, woman and child among us.</p>
<p>And the government is running up mountains of debt with increasing speed. It took just over 5 ½ months for Uncle Sam to go another trillion dollars deeper in debt since hitting $10-trillion last September 30th. It’s the fastest jump in U.S. history. <br />The hundreds of billions of dollars being spent as part of the federal bailout of the financial markets is a leading factor in the rapid increase. Over $400-billion in debt has been accrued in the 57 days since President Obama took office.</p>
<p>And the federal budget he unveiled last month projects even faster increases in the National Debt. It’ll hit $12.7-trillion by the end of the fiscal year on September 30th. The Administration’s four year estimate shows that by the end of September 2012, the Debt will have soared to $16.2-trillion – which amounts to nearly 100% of the projected Gross Domestic Product that year.</p></blockquote>
<p> I don&#8217;t even think that there is any dispute that in popular discussion that &#8216;debt&#8217; is heard to mean what is more technically known as total Public Debt.</p>
<p> On the other hand if you go to the Treasury&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">Debt to the Penny</a> you will get a more complex view. At the close of business April 13th, total Public Debt stood at $11,169,978,555,115.48. But this breaks down to two components, Debt held by the Public at $6.893 trillion and Intragovernmental Holdings at $4.276 trillion. This in turn breaks down as follows. (chart from Wiki)<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SeYckQHuSJI/AAAAAAAAAKM/DAtKwabVBHM/s1600-h/Holders_of_the_National_Debt_Dec08.gif"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SeYckQHuSJI/AAAAAAAAAKM/DAtKwabVBHM/s400/Holders_of_the_National_Debt_Dec08.gif" border="0" alt=""></a><br />First thing of note, the OAS, DI, HI, SMI Trust Funds all are treated separately. Second note interest on those Trust Funds ARE counted as Public Debt, the $2.203 trillion shown as OAS debt in the chart above equating exactly to the year end balance and assets respectively in the following two balance sheet from the Dec. 2008 Montly Trust Fund Report.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SeYgWvLb48I/AAAAAAAAAKU/kUOD4FiaZcU/s1600-h/Dec+08+Trust+Fund.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SeYgWvLb48I/AAAAAAAAAKU/kUOD4FiaZcU/s400/Dec+08+Trust+Fund.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SeYgWlsUb6I/AAAAAAAAAKc/e1pAqni3yEs/s1600-h/Monthly+TF+Balance+Dec+08.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SeYgWlsUb6I/AAAAAAAAAKc/e1pAqni3yEs/s400/Monthly+TF+Balance+Dec+08.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />(Note too that the second balance sheet showed $0 in &#8220;Interest receivable&#8221; while the second showed that of $52.95 billion in interest earned year-to-date fully $52.85 billion was credited in December leaving only $100 million credited in Oct and Nov. Meaning you can&#8217;t just pick any month of the year and draw conclusions, in total context only June and Dec are meaningful.)</p>
<p>So &#8216;Public Debt&#8217; as reported on the Debt Clock includes total Trust Fund balances including interest earned as of Dec 2008. The Trust Funds&#8217; interest are thus included in what I am calling &#8216;Headline debt&#8217;. And those totals assume that we are accounting on Boskin&#8217;s definition 1 of surplus/deficit, which in turn makes &#8216;headline surplus/deficit&#8217; equate to  Unified Budget surplus/deficit.</p>
<p>Now you can argue that this is not the right way for policy makers to think about debt. For example OMB Director Orszag argues as follows:<br />
<blockquote>How much does the federal government owe?  It might seem like a simple question to ask those of us wearing the green eyeshades, but there are lots of different concepts used to answer it.  For example, at the end of fiscal year 2008:<br />Debt held by the public net of financial assets— the measure I find to be most meaningful — stood at $5.3 trillion (37 percent of GDP).<br />Debt held by the public was equal to about $5.8 trillion (41 percent of GDP).<br />Gross debt equaled $10.0 trillion (70 percent of GDP).<br />What do each of these concepts represent?</p>
<p>Let me proceed in reverse order, and begin with gross debt.  Gross debt has two components: debt held by the public—which I will discuss more in a moment— and intragovernmental debt.   Intragovernmental debt is, essentially, debt that the government owes to itself—as of the end of last year, it totaled $4.2 trillion.  The majority of this debt is issued to the Social Security Trust Fund, and most of the remainder is issued to other trust funds, such as the Civil Service Retirement and Medicare Trust Funds.  These trust funds are required to invest their surpluses in government bonds.  While the federal government will certainly make good on the IOUs issued to these trust funds, they should not be counted when assessing the financial state of the federal government as a whole.</p></blockquote>
<p>. Yet most commenters do use Gross debt as the proper measure. Orszag again (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>One branch of the government issuing debt to another branch may make one branch poorer relative to the other branch—but it does not affect the overall financial state of the government.   For example, when I tell my daughter and son that I owe them each $10 for their allowances, I am poorer, and they are richer—as a family, though, there is no change in our overall finances. That’s why the Congressional Budget Office, the Office of Management and Budget (including under the prior administration), and the Government Accountability Office all agree that gross debt is not a meaningful metric for assessing the government’s current fiscal position.   Yet, the world being what it is, this number is quoted often.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those who argue that interest earned on the Trust Fund should not be considered in deciding Social Security policy (in effect abrogating the Trust Fund) cannot use total Public Debt when criticizing Obama budgets, not at least without being intellectually inconsistent. Because by 2019 about $2.5 trillion in total outstanding Public Debt will be the product of Social Security TF interest and interest on that interest</p>
<p>Which makes the  CBO&#8217;s March 2009 OASDI Baseline cut both ways. <br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SeW-nYq1_tI/AAAAAAAAAKE/D3893JRbfZ4/s1600-h/OASDI+March+2009+CBO.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SeW-nYq1_tI/AAAAAAAAAKE/D3893JRbfZ4/s400/OASDI+March+2009+CBO.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />If you want to argue that the key for policy making is really &#8216;Primary Surplus&#8217; and not Unified Budget &#8216;Surplus&#8217; then you need to subtract out TF interest from your Obama budget forecasted additions to Public Debt. Which is to say to move in Orszag&#8217;s direction. Of course many people will try to have it both ways as is convenient instead of using an honest oranges to oranges approach.</p>

                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>Citizens in Granite, Ill noticed a flatbed train, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/16/business/economy/16pipe.html?_r=1&#038;hpw" target="_blank">loaded with steel pipes</a> labeled “Made in India.” All might have been well if not for the fact that Granite’s 140-year-old steel mill had closed in December for lack of orders. Cries of unfair foreign subsidies both in developing countries such as India and China filled the air. (See <a href="http://www.americanmanufacturing.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2008/01/energy-subsidies-in-china-jan-8-08.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> for one study.)</p>
<p>Foreign subsidies are only part of the problem. Equally important are cheap overseas labor and weak environmental regulations. In 2005, for example, the Attorney General brought suit against the Granite mill for air pollution. Developing countries have used weak environmental standards and weak labor laws to leverage rapidly their own industrial base.</p>
<p>Whenever I complain about tax, labor, or environmental arbitrage in developing countries and subsidies&#8211;direct or indirect&#8211;for cheap imported goods, someone will usually remind me that cheap, imported goods, however or wherever they originate are really a boon to someone in the U.S. economy.</p>
<p>This is quite true, undeniably so. Someone in the U.S. or Canada has purchased those pipes, saving money.</p>
<p>The problem is: We have a dog chasing its tail problem, an ever-downward spiral of wages, living conditions, and standard of living. The downward spiral of wages affects everyone, here and abroad, collecting everyone in its vortex.</p>
<p>When developing nations run out of cash—or credit&#8211;, everyone everywhere suffers.</p>
<p>Developing nations, anxious to have their share of the pie, will resort to more extreme measures: More subsidies, greater downward pressure on their own meager pay scales, a tighter grip on currency exchanges. Citizens in mature economies must compete with impossibly cheap labor abroad while living in an expensive environment. The middle class, once touted as the crowning jewel of mature economies, is now seriously in peril.</p>
<p>Escaping this downward spiral is very difficult. Rich individuals at the top, of course, have benefited handsomely. Whether these individuals will continue to benefit should give them second thoughts. Deeper levels of poverty and the thickening stench of a decaying environment will surround them, not exactly a recipe for raising shiny, bright-eyed pampered children ready to learn at prestigious private schools either here or in Asia.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I wonder if a vast scam has been played. At first, economists and global leaders told us that globalization as structured was a win-win game.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usembassy-israel.org.il/publish/press/treasure/archive/2000/may/dt30508.htm" target="_blank">Here</a> is Treasury Secretary Summers in 2000 on the brink of China’s entry into the WTO:<br />
<blockquote>The agreement with China is a one-way street,&#8221; Summers said.<br />&#8220;China opens its markets to an unprecedented degree, while in return the United States simply maintains its current market access policies,&#8221; he said.<br />It is difficult, Summers added, &#8220;to discern any disadvantage to the United States in passing this legislation.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/89aac4dc-6777-11db-8ea5-0000779e2340.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is Summers in 2006. (Note: He makes no mention of the impending credit crash.)<br />
<blockquote>it has been a golden age for those who already own valuable assets. Owners of scarce commodities have seen their returns rise prodigiously. People running businesses that can take advantage of globalisation to source labour less expensively and sell to larger markets have seen their incomes rise far faster than incomes generally. Certainly those in the financial sector in a position to benefit from the asset revaluations associated with globalisation have prospered.<br />Everyone else has not fared nearly as well.</p>
<p>As the great corporate engines of efficiency succeed by using cutting-edge technology with low-cost labour, ordinary, middle-class workers and their employers – whether they live in the American midwest, the Ruhr valley, Latin America or eastern Europe – are left out. This is the essential reason why median family incomes lag far behind productivity growth in the US, why average family incomes in Mexico have barely grown in the 13 years since the North American Free Trade Agreement passed, and why middle-income countries without natural resources struggle to define an area of comparative advantage.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 2006, he started to pull back the curtain on this sorry drama, a bit late, alas.</p>
<p>I do not mean to pick on Summers; he has certainly not been alone in promoting the present structure of globalization. Many economists have been part of the celebratory chorus. He just happens to be leading our economic recovery team.</p>
<p>Escaping from this downward spiral will be, as I said, very, very difficult. I have listened closely to remarks in the present administration. I have not heard a real answer. Most are simply Clinton hangovers or hand-me-downs. The Bush administration was all too eager push the game even further.</p>
<p>The Nature of the Problem</p>
<p>This kind of dangerous spiral is avoided when economies are closely matched, when nations are at a relatively equal level of development. Currency exchange rates, along with carefully monitored rules, often solve the problem, a bumpy arrangement, but it works.</p>
<p>The problem is similarly manageable if a small, impoverished nation tries to play industrial catch-up among a cluster of more mature economies. The cost of its rapid industrialization can be absorbed.</p>
<p>But now we have two huge underdeveloped nations (one democratic, the other repressively autocratic)—along with an ever-growing flotilla of smaller impoverished nations—suddenly and energetically entering global commerce. Among the leading economists in the Clinton and Bush administration, I never heard any cautionary mention of this kind of problem. Free trade was the mantra; fast tracked trade agreements were the candles to light the way.</p>
<p>The latest pitch is that the mature economies must now invest in and create new technologies.</p>
<p>That is easier said then done.</p>
<p>What, for example, is to stop nascent industries in mature economies from chasing cheaper labor abroad? What is to stop them from seeking benefits from currency exchanges or better subsidies? Already, many multinationals are setting up Research and Development centers third world countries—cheaper labor, cheaper hidden costs such as environmental and energy.</p>
<p>For these reasons, I have to grimace at this latest bromide. To many, it seems such a marvelous answer is simple, direct, and understandable. Politicians and economists who tout it are praised for their insight and acumen. The public buys it; the press celebrates it. All those who utter it are clearly wise beyond their years. Some of us in the balcony sits know it for what it is.</p>
<p>The fact is: Given the way commerce has been structured, developing nations offer inducements that are simply irresistible. If energy can be made cheaper at cost to the environment, what factory in China does not benefit? Granite, Ill, had to pay those costs. Granite, Ill, had no hope of ever being competitive given the rules governing globalization. It&#8217;s fate was sealed a decade ago.</p>
<p>The Solution?</p>
<p>Going forward, I can see only one path. And, honestly, I do not think it will happen.</p>
<p>First, labor rights to bargain collectively must be enforced globally. Doing so will of course raise the price of all those cheap imports. But, it will also more rapidly diminish the vast pay scale differences between impoverished and mature economies. Additionally, it will force rich corporations to release a greater share of the pie to all the have-nots.</p>
<p>If a country refuses to enforce labor standards or it refuses to allow grass roots bargaining, then it should be a pariah among nations.</p>
<p>Second, environmental standards must be global. Cap and trade will not do it. Cap and trade is designed to placate environmental concerns and climate change within a free market context. It does not address the kind of problem I have outlined: The downward spiral of wages and standard of living. Simply put, we must accept the full cost of all production everywhere&#8211;here and abroad.</p>
<p>In the West, we have air standards that significantly raise the cost of production of such items as steel. (Those standards have been under increasing pressure.)</p>
<p>Additionally, those air and other environmental standards affect the cost of energy. Simply passing off these kinds of concerns as extraneous variables does not past muster. Environmental standards affect the cost of every good that is produced. Those countries that leverage environmental costs for commercial advantage should be considered pariahs. Environmental standards have to be global.</p>
<p>As I said, I have few hopes that any of these changes will happen until our collective backs are truly against the wall.</p>
<p>Nothing focuses the mind better than looking over the precipice. We are not there yet. The present system will be band aided, patched, and protected until the very last minute. Too many scholarly careers are at stake; too much wealth and power is at risk; too many countries—in the East and the West—have placed their bets on the present global arrangement. The old bugaboo, protectionism, will be trotted forth to scare those without the sophistication to know that protectionism was never the issue. Rules of the road were the issues.</p>
<p>We will hear more and more disclosures similar to the one Summers made in 2006. Well, NAFTA did not turn out so well. Hmmm…cheap labor is a problem with no easy solution…and on it will go. But remember: These are the same people that said the road to the now looming precipice was strewn with flowers and quick wealth, a &#8220;one-way&#8221; street to global prosperity. There will be no winners. This has been a lose-lose proposition.</p>

                                <p>Ken Houghton lowers the level of discourse at AB by discussing the career of a porn star other than Adam West.</p>
<p>One of the primary tenets of economic theory is that corporations believe in nothing other than profits.  Well, it&#8217;s not quite that stark—we use phrases such as &#8220;utility maximization,&#8221; &#8220;cost minimization,&#8221; and the like—but the basic idea is that corporations, even more than individuals (silly humans!), have as their sole target maximizing profits.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m a bit confused <a target="_blank" href="http://www.vancouversun.com/business/Interracial+porn+pioneer+Marilyn+Chambers+dead/1492289/story.html">by the Vancouver Sun&#8217;s poorly-edited* obituary for Marilyn Chambers</a>.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put the timeline together:
<ol>
<li>Chambers &#8220;began her onscreen career as an Ivory Snow detergent model.&#8221;</p>
</li>
<li>Chambers made <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0068260/">Behind the Green Door</a>, released in 1972.
</li>
<li>The movie &#8220;prompted a run on boxes of Ivory Snow, which featured a photo of Chambers.&#8221;
<p>So far I follow this: actress tries a different role, reaches a whole new audience, and sales of her previous works soar. (Think Kristin Chenoweth <a target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0259145/">going from Broadway to television</a>. Or maybe not.)  What I don&#8217;t understand is the reaction:</p>
</li>
<li>[T]he scandal produced &#8220;a Marilyn Chambers clause in all modeling contracts, saying that you can never have posed topless or nude or been in any kind of adult film or Playboy or anything like that.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Let&#8217;s review. M<s>K</s>arilyn Chambers (h/t Tony C.) causes a major spike in sales of Ivory Snow detergent.  Better yet, some of those people probably aren&#8217;t even going to open the box, so they&#8217;re going to have to buy another detergent as well—<strong>and</strong>, even time they have to go shopping, they&#8217;re going to see that Ivory Snow detergent and, if they need detergent, they&#8217;ll have an identification with it.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Robert, <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/4640988825698905261/">in comments</a>, notes that this may be a rational act, if we assume normal market segmentation and a lack of loyalty on the part of the spurt of buying.</p>
<p>I believe this is what economists refer to as a &#8220;win-win&#8221; situation.</p>
<p>So why would the result be a &#8220;business decision&#8221; specifically banning the possibility  of developing such cross-marketing potential in the future?</p>
<p>*I say poorly edited because on things such as that the last sentence of paragraph three is &#8220;The L.A. County coroner is examining the cause of death, but a spokesman said foul play is not suspected.&#8221; and the closing of paragraph four is &#8220;The cause of death is under investigation but foul play was not suspected and an autopsy is pending,&#8221; which strikes as the equivalent of giving the reader a sense of deja vu through stereotomy glasses.</p>

<p>Industrial production fell 1.5% in March, the same as in February.</p>
<p>From the peak industrial production has now fallen 13.4%.  This makes it worse than the 13.0% fall in the 1974 and 1958 recessions and the 9.3% drop in the 1982 recessions.  This measure says this is now the deepest post WW II recession.</p>

<p>The good news is the rebound in productivity that began last month continued this month.  The three month growth in implied manufacturing productivity is now above the year over year change.  Historically, productivity leads output and it would be really unusual to see output bottom before productivity bottoms.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SeX3YECg9pI/AAAAAAAAAvM/p_auMI5lk9w/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SeX3YECg9pI/AAAAAAAAAvM/p_auMI5lk9w/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The first quarter real GDP and productivity numbers will be interesting.  Hours worked fell more in the first quarter than in the fourth quarter.  But business output should not fall as much in the first quarter as it did in the fourth quarter.  Consequently, first quarter productivity should show a nice bounce and productivity growth generally leads real GDP growth by two quarters..</p>

<p>WILLIAM D. COHAN has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/opinion/15cohan.html?_r=1">rather harsh op-ed in the New York Times </a>about Goldman Sachs&#8217;s reported $ 1.8 billion in profits in the first quarter.  Ah op-eds about accounting in the New York Times.  He notes, as many have on the web, that Goldman Sachs lost December 2008 when they switched from a fiscal year ending November 30 2008 to a new year starting January 1 2009.  Ooops.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Part of the answer lies in a little sleight of hand. One consequence of Goldman’s becoming a bank holding company last year was that it had to switch its fiscal year to the calendar year. Previously, Goldman’s fiscal year had ended on Nov. 30. Now it ends Dec. 31. </p>
<p>As a result, December 2008 was not included in Goldman’s rosy first-quarter 2009 numbers. In that month, Goldman lost a little more than $1 billion, after a $1 billion writedown related to “non-investment-grade credit origination activities” and a further $625 million related to commercial real estate loans and securities. All told, in the last seven months, Goldman has lost $1.5 billion. But that number didn’t come up on Monday. How convenient. </p></blockquote>
<p>Quite but wouldn&#8217;t the more natural number to compare with the profit of 1.8 billion in the past three months be the profit of around 800 million in the past four months ?  That would be total profit (not loss) since the last quarterly profit and loss statement.  The loss in the September-October-November 2008 has already been reported.  Why re-report it ?  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d say Mr Cohan knows a little bit about sleight of hand no ?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2215897/">William Saletan</a> covers new bold, to him alarmingly extreme, frontiers of public policy.  Here he shows he hasn&#8217;t quite figured out Smith&#8217;s insights on public finance and that he considers &#8220;On Liberty&#8221; by John Stuart Mill to flirt dangerously with paternalism.  Saletan is unique (thank God).</p>
<blockquote><p>New York City&#8217;s health commissioner, Thomas Frieden, &#8230; and Kelly Brownell, the director of Yale&#8217;s Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity, propose a penny-per-ounce excise tax on &#8220;sugared beverages.&#8221; That&#8217;s nearly $3 per case.</p></blockquote>
<p>And who else is on board ? Any tax on sugar or beverages or beverages made with sugar ever been discussed in the history of economic analysis of public finance.</p>
<p>You guessed it, they quote Adam Smith &#8220;Sugar, rum, and tobacco are commodities which are nowhere necessaries of life, which are become objects of almost universal consumption, and which are therefore extremely proper subjects of taxation.&#8221;</p>
<p>more after the jump.</p>
<p>Oh my taxation and &#8220;necessaries&#8221; remind me of something.  Yep its from the same page which anticipated <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/inequality-infant-mortality-and-adam.html">an idea which I considered heterodox 216 years later</a>.  Which comes after the page which, Sen noted, contained his idea of &#8220;functionings.&#8221;  Doesn&#8217;t it make you want to read the whole book ?</p>
<p>In fact, Adam Smith&#8217;s thought on this subject is coincidentally contemporary.  He advocates taxing rum, sugar and tobacco because taxing them will not reduce labor supply.  Adam Smith assumed labor supply depended on demographics where fertility is fixed and increased infant and child mortality cause lower labor supply.  A good is not a necessary if &#8220;sober industrious&#8221; people will reduce consumption of it rather than endanger their childrens&#8217; lives.  Smith had just noted that shirts and shoes were necessities for his purposes (he asserted that the poor of his day would rather skimp on food and increase the risk of a child dying that shame oneself by walking around without a shirt).  Anyone who wouldn&#8217;t cut back on sugar and tobacco must be an unfit parent anyway and so their kids are doomed (or if they survive will be delinquents).  Don&#8217;t get mad at me, I am just paraphrasing Smith. </p>
<p>Saletan adopts a skeptical tone.  He considers the revenue a side benefit of a paternalistic policy. He compares the soft drink tax to no soft drink tax with no other tax or spending cuts to make up for the lost revenues.  I think he considers this the philosophically correct way to focus on the issue.  In sum, he seems to think the policy might improve welfare but is inconsistent with classical liberal principles of consumer sovereignty.</p>
<p>That is, he is not only more in favor of free markets than Smith but more of a classical liberal that Mill.  I quote from <a href="http://www.serendipity.li/jsmill/on_liberty_chapter_5.htm">&#8220;On Liberty&#8221;</a></p>
<blockquote><p>It is hence the duty of the State to consider, in the imposition of taxes, what commodities the consumers can best spare; and a fortiori, to select in preference those of which it deems the use, beyond a very moderate quantity, to be positively injurious. Taxation, therefore, of stimulants, up to the point which produces the largest amount of revenue (supposing that the State needs all the revenue which it yields) is not only admissible, but to be approved of. </p></blockquote>
<p>OK he was thinking of alchoholic not caffeinated beverages but only because he didn&#8217;t know that consumption of sugar (and high fructose corn syrup) beyond a &#8230; quantity are positively injurious.  However, here we have it, Saletan considers the choice of taxing something which is positively injurious to be illiberal.  He doesn&#8217;t seem to understand that his argument would ban all consideration of incentive effects of taxes.</p>
<p>Back to Smith and his concidental contemporary relevance.</p>
<p>Totally aside from his interesting thoughts on &#8220;necessaries,&#8221; his theory of labor supply seems bizarre to us now.  However, it fits the data he was analyzing according to noted economic historian Greg Clarke.</p>
<p>Ok so now we have contraceptives and infant and child mortality rates which are tragic but not a major determinant of the number of working age adults.  When we talk about the effect of taxes on labor supply we tend to mean the effect on the choice of working age adults to seek work.  Oddly (coincidence really) the soda tax won&#8217;t affect labor supply on this dimension much either.  Non employed people drink soda too.  Many taxes on consumption goods might shift incentives away from paid work as non employed people don&#8217;t consume the good, but soda consumption is pretty flat all the way down the income scale.</p>
<p>Amusingly soft drinks are my one personal second favorite guess for foolish consumption choices (by parents) which leads to infant deaths in developing countries.  Number 1 is baby formula mixed with unsafe drinking water of course.  So I have a soft drinks and health hypothesis related to those pages by Smith.  (Hey this is after the jump to so I don&#8217;t have to write comprehensibly).</p>
<p>Update:  Smart guys think alike.  <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/04/how_to_think_about_public_health_taxes.php">Matthew Yglesias agrees with Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill.  </a><br />I corrected the update from &#8220;Great minds think alike.&#8221;  Such a judgment would be premature in the case of Yglesias.  However, he is very very smart.  Not original of course. I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s read &#8220;On Liberty&#8221; (assigned reading for a course I&#8217;m sure he took which I took (pass/fail)).  The argument is well known and, as yet, unrefuted.  Salaten is noting it in passing and not engaging it because he is Salaten not because he is ignorant.</p>
<p>Many commenters on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/04/soak-rich-non-lesson-from-europe.html">a post below </a>criticizing a specific argument made by Yglesias (and Ezra Klein) made more general criticisms of them &#8212; noting for example their lack of credentials.  So what ?  Yglesias has a BA in philosophy and an excellent understanding of economics.  Klein is half my age and knows 200 times as much about health care policy.  Credentials are for people who don&#8217;t have the time energy or ability to look at the quality of arguments and the supporting evidence.</p>

<p>This is getting alarming.  Two very smart bloggers &#8212; Matthew Yglesias and Ezra Klein argue (using the term broadly) against soaking the rich.  The bizarre thing is that they don&#8217;t present an argument that it would be bad policy and they certainly don&#8217;t present the argument that it is politically impossible.  My good faith effort to detect a pragmatic argument in their posts is that they assume that not enough revenue can be raised by raising taxes on the rich.   Note the word assume.  They don&#8217;t say anything specific about the amount of revenue they think should be raised by taxes or the definition of &#8220;the rich&#8221; or how much money can be raised by this or that tax increase on the rich or anything.  </p>
<p>I think the motivation of both posts is the observation that European taxes are, if anything, slightly less progressive than US taxes, but the European tax and transfer system is much much more equalizing than the US tax and transfer system (even if you don&#8217;t count services provided in kind like free medical care in income).  Thus the argument seems to be: The USA should turn into Europe.  Europe doesn&#8217;t have extremely progressive taxes.  We shouldn&#8217;t soak the rich.</p>
<p>Support for my accusation that this is the argument and a counterargument after the jump.</p>
<p>Partly Klein and Yglesias are presenting a valid simple mathimatical (arithmetical really) point &#8212; progressivity is not a measure of the effect of the fiscal system on the distribution of income.</p>
<p>In fact, the point of both posts is that a tax and transfer system can reduce inequality even if the tax is not progressive.  Obviously so long as the transfers (or publicly provided services) are directly more equally than pre-tax income. You don&#8217;t have to give more to the poor than the non poor, you don&#8217;t even have to give as much to the poor as the non poor, you just need that the poor&#8217;s share of the benefits is higher than the poor&#8217;s share of income (and so on up the distribution).  Since the standard redistributive policy considered by economists is a flat tax used to fund equal grants to everyone, this is not news to me.</p>
<p>This is correct arithmetic but it is not of any practical interest to people in the USA.  Increased transfers funded by increased taxes on the upper middle class might be good for the USA, but they are probably politically impossible.  Increased taxes on the rich have overwhelming popular support.  Klein and Yglesias don&#8217;t ever argue that it is better to tax the upper middle class than the rich, they just argue that it would be good too.  So what ?  It&#8217;s politically impossible and not (according to their arguments) as good as something that is politically possible).</p>
<p>The only quantitative argument in either post is an observation about taxes in the USA and Europe (hence my claim that their argument amounts to saying Europe is perfect).</p>
<p>&#8220;You could easily imagine a somewhat more regressive tax structure that leads to a more progressive country.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Look Ezra imagining something and even observing it on the other side of the Atlantic is very different from finding 60 votes for it in the senate.  And one could also imagine a somewhat more progressive tax structure that leads to a more progressive country *and* maybe make it happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the case in Europe where more regressive taxes fund a much more progressive welfare state. The middle class pays more in health care taxes but gets much more in services.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yet Klein doesn&#8217;t investigate the origens of European tax policy *or* European outcomes at all. Surely he knows that Europe has had low employment growth compared to the USA. Has he heard of people who argue that the key issue is that European taxes are too regressive ? One, Romano Prodi, was prime minister of Italy until recently. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m another. When I present the argument to students, I have to laugh at myself for saying something so kackneyed. I mean Italians have been making the case for decades and they don&#8217;t have to pay me a salary to explain it to them.</p>
<p>Also why don&#8217;t Europeans soak the rich ? To a great extent it&#8217;s because they can&#8217;t. In Italy the rich are mostly self employed. It is just not possible to enforce high tax rates on them. In the USA the vaster majority of people are employees including the vast majority of the super rich. Plain old tax evasion is very difficult in the USA. This makes the optimal tax rate different there than here (in Italy) </p>
<p>Look at taxes in European countries where a similar fraction of people are self employed. Otherwise you are comparing apples and oranges which is silly totally aside from the fact that Klein assumes that oranges are perfect by definition.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>IN a comment to a post a while ago, someone asked me to explain the phrase &#8220;money metric welfare&#8221; and why I hate it so much.  It is, in fact, the element of economic theory which I like least, at that is saying something.</p>
<p>A good explanation is given by a <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/04/hoisted-from-the-archives-a-non-socratic-dialogue-on-social-welfare-functions.html">non Socratic dialogue </a>reposted by Brad DeLong.  He calls it &#8220;The Market&#8217;s Social Welfare Function.&#8221;  This means he assumes the standard assumptions sufficient to make market outcomes Pareto efficient, rationality, perfect competition, market clearing, no externalities, symmetric information and complete markets.</p>
<p>My effort at explanation after the jump.</p>
<p>The idea is to choose a starting point A then evaluate changes from that starting point to a new point B in terms of the dollar (or numeraire) good value of the change to each individual and then add up these amounts.  The advantage is that this gives a number so that if the number is positive one might have some reason to claim that B is better than A.  The disadvantage is that no one who understands what is going on can seriously believe that claim.</p>
<p>The points A and B are social outcomes &#8212; complete descriptions of the world from now until forever.  The sort of change one might assess would be say taxing CO2 emissions and dividing the proceeds equally among all citizens.  </p>
<p>For each person one can imagine calculating (or eliciting) an equivilant variation EV_i an amount of cash such that the individual is indifferent between the reform (moving to state B) and receiving EV_i in cash.  The is the money metric benefit of the reform.  Obviously EV_i can be negative.  If so the absolute value of EV_i is the amount of money metric cost to i of the reform.</p>
<p>Then the total money metric effect of the reform EV is the sum over all citizens i of EV_i.</p>
<p>It is clear that the choice of the initial state A is critical to this calculation.  It is just not true that if the EV of a change from A to B is negative, then the EV of a change from B to A is positive.  The choice of the initial state A is critical and always made very casually when attempting to calculate EVs.</p>
<p>EV is not a change in a function which depends only on preferences and technology.  Only once an initial state is chosen is there anything like a social welfare function.  We can say that state A gives the maximum money metric utility for initial state A if the EV for the change to all possible other states is negative.</p>
<p>We can understand EV by comparing it to another hypothetical function.  Imagine that everyone has a utility function which describes how happy they are as a function of outcomes. EV_i says they are equally happy in state A and in (state B plus they get EV_i in cash).  </p>
<p>If we thought that utility functions exist, a natural social welfare function would be just add up the utility functions to get to total happiness.   This corresponds very closely (but not exactly) to the voice of my personal concience (I am very nearly a hard core add em up utilitarian).  It does not correspond at all to money metric welfare.</p>
<p>If, as mentioned above, state A gives maximimum money metric welfare (for initial state A) then A maximizes a weighted sum of utility functions.  The weights are the inverses of the marginal utlity of cash (the increase in happiness due to one more cent say).  This implies a huge weight on the happiness of a rich person compared to the weight on the happiness of a poor person.  It has no moral appeal.</p>
<p>One reason it is of some theoretical interest to economists is that if state A gives maximimum money metric welfare (for initial state A) then state A is Pareto efficient, that is, it is impossible to make everyone better off by changing to B.  If such a Pareto improvement were possible, every EV_i would be positive so the sum would be positive .  Also the free market outcome must be such a state such a state given the standard assumptions of rationality, perfect competition, market clearing, no externalities, symmetric information and complete markets, which imply that the result would be of no practical relevance (since all the assumptions are false statements about the real world) even if &#8220;money metric welfare&#8221; meant &#8220;welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>One way of seeing this is to consider a change which has nothing to do with money or private consumption.   Say we are deciding about whether to paint the Washington Monument pink (the paint and labor are both free by assumption).  I&#8217;d guess this has a negative EV, but, in principle some people might like that. </p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s imagine a national lottery with a prize of say 100 billion (not optional) and use the state before the painting but after the lottery ticket is picked as our initial state A.  If the winner is one of hte few people who wants a pink Washington moneument, it is entirely possible that painting it pink will have a positive EV.  Someone with over 100 billion will be willing to spend billions on a whim and most people don&#8217;t care much.  On the other hand, if the winner is someone who doesn&#8217;t want it pink, then the EV of painting it will be negative. </p>
<p>OK the right thing for society to do, the social welfare maximizing color of the Washington monument, can&#8217;t really depend on the blind chance of a lottery can it ?  <br />I don&#8217;t think so, and so I consider the concept of money metric utility idiotic.<br />No one defends the claim that EV is social welfare.  </p>
<p>Many people, however, pull a sneaky trick.  They argue that social welfare and the right choice to make etc are inherently normative choices, statements about our values as well as about facts.  EV sure isn&#8217;t a statement of anyone&#8217;s values (unless that person has deep respect for the God of chance).  Therefore it is a positive statement.</p>
<p>So we can separate statements of fact and value as statements about EV and other statements about how things are good or bad.  We can call EV efficiency and note that we also care about equity.  All of this is based on the fact that a change can have positive EV even though it only helps a few super rich people and hurts everyone else.</p>
<p>OK just because something isn&#8217;t the function we should maximize and the guide to right choice that doesn&#8217;t mean it is a measure of efficiency.  I can make as many arbitrary functions as I want all of which have any desirable property which EV with initial state A has.  </p>
<p>The argument is, as always, look at this, it is not what we wish we had.  Therefore it is a useful approximation to what we wish we had.  I assert the argument is really just that, that I have left out nothing and been totally fair to the advocates of EV.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I think very few people have ever been convinced. </p>
