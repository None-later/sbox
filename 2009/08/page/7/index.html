<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/health/policy/27insure.html?_r=1">NYT</a> reports on $40,000/year health plans as we discuss health payment options for health care.</p>
<blockquote><p>Goldman Sachs is one of the nation’s richest banks, and hundreds of top Goldman employees have a health care package to match — one of the “gold-plated Cadillac” plans cited by those involved in the health care debate in Washington. </p>
<p>Reach of Subsidies Is Critical Issue for Health Plan (July 27, 2009) Goldman’s 400 or so managing directors and its top executive officers participate in the bank’s executive medical and dental program as part of their benefits, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The program generally costs the bank $40,543 in premiums annually for each participant’s family.</p>
<p>Those taking part in the plan include the company’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, and four other top officers, as well as managing directors, whose base salary is $600,000. </p>
<p>Goldman’s medical coverage entered the health care discussion on Sunday when David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Obama, cited the Goldman program as an example of the expensive benefits the administration might consider taxing to help pay for its health care program. </p>
<p>“The president actually was asked this the other day by Jim Lehrer, and what he said was that this was an intriguing idea to put an excise tax on high-end health care policies like the ones that the executives at Goldman Sachs have, the $40,000 policies,” Mr. Axelrod said. </p>
<p>Goldman did not return messages on Sunday to comment about Mr. Axelrod’s comments. </p>
<p>A proposal by Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, would impose an excise tax on the insurers that issue policies like Goldman’s, with the expectation that the insurers would pass along most, if not all, of the cost to employers who buy the plans.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, which is working on bipartisan version of the health care legislation in Congress, had long expressed interest in taxing some employer-provided benefits — a move many budget experts say would help slow the steep rise in health costs. </p>
<p>A number of Democrats opposed the plan, so negotiators began looking for other ways to cover the roughly $1 trillion, 10-year cost of the bill. </p>
<p>Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and an author of the Finance Committee’s health bill, endorsed taxing rich plans during an appearance Sunday on “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” on ABC.</p>
<p>Asked if Congress would tax high-end plans, Mr. Conrad said: “I think we’ve got to. Again, virtually every economist that’s come before us has said you’ve got to reduce that tax subsidy as part of an overall strategy to really contain costs.” </p>
<p>An aide to Republicans involved in the Finance Committee negotiations said the idea was “on the table in discussions as a serious effort by Senator Kerry to restart the conversation on bending down the cost curve.” Aides to Senator Max Baucus confirmed that he, too, was considering the proposal, and House leaders said they were as well. </p>
<p>Negotiators have not yet determined the value of the plans that would set off a tax on the insurance companies; the numbers under discussion range from $20,000 to $40,000 annually, a senior administration official said.</p></blockquote>

<p>Summary from Director&#8217;s Blog <a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=342">CBO’s Long-Term Projections for Social Security: 2009 Update</a><br />Full Report: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/104xx/doc10457/08-07-SocialSecurity_Update.pdf">Long-Term Projections for Social Security: 2009 Update</a></p>
<p>This newest report on the long-range health of Social Security shows a shape not much changed from last year&#8217;s but with some changes in the detailed dates and numbers. Per this report Social Security will be able to pay out &#8220;scheduled benefits&#8221; until Trust Fund exhaustion in 2043 and thereafter will be able to pay out &#8220;payable benefits&#8221; at a rate starting at 83% of scheduled benefits and then gradually sinking to 78% by 2083. Even after adjusting for inflation benefits after 2043 will be better than retirees get today in real terms even though they will be a smaller replacement percentage. That is our children&#8217;s retirement will be materially better than that of their grandparents if not quite keeping up with the working life gains of their own grandchildren. And this even if we don&#8217;t fix Social Security along lines suggested by the <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/05/nw-plan-for-real-social-security-fix.html">Northwest Plan for a Real Social Security Fix</a>.</p>
<p>If we did decide to fix Social Security on the revenue side we are faced with a gap scored by CBO of 1.3% of payroll compared to the 2.0% SSA score. That is where the NW Plan, based as it is on the more conservative SSA number, would have a year two increased tax of around $1.50 per week for the median income household, under CBO numbers that would be down to just around a $1.00. (If anyone is interested in seeing why CBO and SSA come up with these different scores please consult App. B on pages 33-34.)</p>
<p>Important note. CBO figures typically show the 80% probability band, meaning there is a 10% chance that outcomes will be more positive and an equal chance they will be more negative. That is when examining Figure 1 above note that there is a small chance that Social Security will actually self-fund without changes even within the 80% band (the medium blue area of overlap) plus a small chance that it would even be overfunded once you add in the upper 10%. Also note that this distribution is somewhat stricter than many where a 90% band would be more typical.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>By Spencer,</p>
<p>Yesterday in describing the employment report I said:<br />
<blockquote>Moreover, the manufacturing work week rose from 39.5 to 39.8 hours and overtime hours were 2.9 hours versus 2.8 in the second quarter. Much of this was auto and confirms the other reports that at least auto output is rebounding.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was criticized and accused of political bias because I was placing too much emphasis on the auto industry. According to my critics the increase in the auto hours worked should be ignored because it was due to government interference and did not reflect what was really happening in the economy.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was implied that the auto industry was atypical and was not representative of the rest of the economy. The BLS publishes the hours worked for ten sub industries of durable manufacturing. So what happened to them? In nine of the ten industries the work week expanded last month and four industries switched from falling hours worked to rising hours worked.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Sn26Nh2GCvI/AAAAAAAAA1k/5wImwN_aBLQ/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Sn26Nh2GCvI/AAAAAAAAA1k/5wImwN_aBLQ/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Moreover, in the private service providing industries,  hours worked expanded 0.3%, the first monthly increase since August, 2008. Just to put this in perspective, employment in the private service providing industries is 112,788,000 or roughly ten times employment of 11,817,000 in all manufacturing:</p>
<p>So the criticism that the hours worked just reflected the impact of the cash for clunkers on the working of the economy is obviously completely wrong.</p>
<p>Yes, as I pointed out the hours worked increase was impacted by the auto sector, but it was widespread through out the economy. The improvement in the service sector was particularly significant and that had nothing to do with the auto sector.</p>
<p>Moreover, I specifically pointed out that hours worked is a leading indicator of future employment. At no time did I say that the recession was over. That was the reason I characterized the employment report as encouraging. Compared to many other private<br />analysts, especially on Wall Street, I thought my analysis was very tempered.</p>
<p>I do not see where it was politically biased, and the argument that hours worked expanded only because of the auto sector just reflects ignorance.</p>

<p>Those of us with a passing knowledge of the development of Communism and Fascism within the larger context of the Popular Revolution vs Reaction tend to scratch our heads when people accuse Obama and his whole program of being both. After all in Europe, the historical cradle of each, the movements have seen to be the Left and Right anchors of a political spectrum that has various democratic flavors in between: Social Democrats, Liberal Democrats, Christian Democrats and the like. But that is the result of looking at his through a narrow lens focussing on who is in or out of political power and/or which party is holding the balance.  There are alternative analytical schema that break this down in very different ways. To illustrate the mind-set that animates some, but by no means all, of the fervent opposition to Obama I would like to give you this from a review of Friedrich Hayek&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://mises.org/store/Road-to-Serfdom-The-P252C0.aspx">The Road to Serfdom</a></p>
<blockquote><p>This spell-binding book is a classic in the history of liberal ideas. It was singularly responsible for launching an important debate on the relationship between political and economic freedom. It made the author a world-famous intellectual. It set a new standard for what it means to be a dissident intellectual. It warned of a new form of despotism enacted in the name of liberation. And though it appeared in 1944, it continues to have a remarkable impact. No one can consider himself well-schooled in modern political ideas without having absorbed its lessons.</p>
<p>What F.A. Hayek saw, and what most all his contemporaries missed, was that every step away from the free market and toward government planning represented a compromise of human freedom generally and a step toward a form of dictatorship&#8211;and this is true in all times and places. He demonstrated this against every claim that government control was really only a means of increasing social well-being. Hayek said that government planning would make society less liveable, more brutal, more despotic. Socialism in all its forms is contrary to freedom.</p>
<p>Nazism, he wrote, is not different in kind from Communism. Further, he showed that the very forms of government that England and America were supposedly fighting abroad were being enacted at home, if under a different guise. Further steps down this road, he said, can only end in the abolition of effective liberty for everyone.</p>
<p>Capitalism, he wrote, is the only system of economics compatible with human dignity, prosperity, and liberty. To the extent we move away from that system, we empower the worst people in society to manage what they do not understand.</p></blockquote>
<p>For followers of Hayek&#8217;s tradition the enemy is statism and their bulwark, their strength is capitalism. To argue as many leftists do that opponents of health care reform or of increases in minimum wage or any other intevention by the State to improve social or economic justice are just arguing against their own material interests, and that in doing so they are just siding with the bosses fall on deaf ears. Once you have internalized the twin equations Capitalism=Freedom &#038; Statism=Tyranny you can well understand why Movement Conservatives first rejected the Eisenhower and Rockefeller Republicans who espoused Goo-Goo approaches (&#8216;Goo-Goo&#8217; being an old, somewhat derisive term for the Good Government movement). For people who followed Hayek the Interstate Highway System was not an instrument for good, the fact that it was government initiated, funded and maintained made it more like a Superhighway to Serfdom.</p>
<p>Not all the fury being exhibited has its total roots in this Hayek-Friedman-Libertarian soil, there are clearly cultural and racial roots to much of it as well. But if you think that somewhere behind that shouting face is the committment to one of the original rallying cries of Movement Conservatism, that of Barry Goldwater in his acceptance speech in 1964: &#8216;I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue!</p>
<p>Not my own cup of tea, I kind of believe in steady pursuit of justice. I just want to point out that this is not just mindless anger, there is at least some coherentness behind it. An insurance claims rep is an agent of capitalism and so an ally of Freedom. A government health care bureaucrat is an agent of statism and so an enemy of Freedom. Making an operational argument that either one is getting between you and your doctor doesn&#8217;t cut any ice. Either you are for Freedom or against Freedom, if that comes with some personal sacrifice sobeit.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I hate to type that headline given the health care reform debate, but I am alarmed by Karen DeYoung&#8217;s article in the Washington Post about new efforts to get Afghans to stop producing opium &#8212; all new this time with carrots.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/07/AR2009080703678_2.html?hpid=topnews&#038;sid=ST2009080703797">problem is that the price of wheat is too low</a>.  <br />
<blockquote>The average Helmand farmer cultivates less than an acre of land, with about half an acre planted in poppy yielding a gross income of about $2,000. After paying 45 percent of that in production costs, and 10 percent in local taxes, he nets about $900, more than twice what he would earn from wheat at current, albeit rising, prices. </p></blockquote>
<p>OK if there is one thing the US government can do it is drive up the price of wheat to subsidize wheat farmers.  So what&#8217;s happening ?  Check after the jump.</p>
<p>First, the program is funded at $300 million out of the total Afghan effort of <br /><a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/afghanistan_/2009/08/solving_the_poverty_problem_in_afghanistan_by_handing_out_money.php">$65 billion.</a>  Odd proportion there.</p>
<p>Still that&#8217;s a lot of money given that Afghan farmers don&#8217;t make much growing opium<br />
<blockquote>More than 365,000 Afghan farm households earned about $730 million from poppy last year </p></blockquote>
<p>Hmmm and they grow opium because they would make half as much growing wheat so buying wheat forward at twice the world price would mean paying 730 million for about 365 million in wheat costing oh about 365 million so what the hell is the problem ?  Now obviously this will also involve buying wheat from people who currently grow wheat (smaller crop than opium by value so even if no targeting is possible this will less than double the cost so it is still chicken feed compared to the cost of the war).  I guess the people smuggling opium out of Afghanistan will maybe smuggle wheat on the way back, but, you know, at twice the world price a kilo of wheat is still not worth much.</p>
<p>My proposal is to buy wheat forward at a high enough price that farmers will be busy growing it and not have time for opium.</p>
<p>The problem is that that would be welfare and not for US farmers.  So we must have no &#8220;subsidies&#8221; and instead sell fertilizer for one tenth of its market price (good think poppies just hate fertilizer) plus low interest loans which do no good at all to opium farmers (except that they do). The program is complicated (sounds like it was designed by Ira Magaziner) the key point is that it is based on vouchers.  Huh?<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The way [the assistance] is offered is important,&#8221; said the senior U.S. military official, one of several who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the program on the record. &#8220;We are not providing subsidies . . . we are not just handing out cash.&#8221; Farmers will have a &#8220;stake&#8221; in the program, he said, buying vouchers for seeds and fertilizers for about 10 percent of their value. Cash will be distributed only as credit or for work performed, the official added. </p></blockquote>
<p>Unsurprisingly </p>
<p>The timeline is daunting. A planned &#8220;civilian surge&#8221; of hundreds of U.S. aid officials and agriculture experts has been slow to arrive. A micro-finance loan program is in the planning stages, and although $300 million in aid has been set aside for &#8220;rapid response&#8221; initiatives, including voucher programs for seeds and fertilizer, distribution has been sluggish. Mohammad Gulab Mangal, the governor of Helmand, whom U.S. officials have praised for encouraging local communities to turn away from poppy, held the first of eight scheduled outreach meetings only last week. </p>
<p>US policy is damaged by the strangely different rules for military operations and for aid. Killing people is urgent and collateral damage is acceptable, but giving money to people uh oohhhh we have to worry about creating dependency (which is, you know, the whole point of the operation).</p>
<p>in conclusion<br />
<blockquote>Wages in Helmand for lancing, $15 a day, are the highest in the country.</p>
<p>&#8220;What we&#8217;re looking for is a way to compete with that,&#8221; the senior military official said of the opium economy. &#8220;This is not easy. . . . There is no silver bullet.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The US government can&#8217;t afford to compete with people who pay $15 a day?!?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say a less pathetically low amount of silver is the silver bullet.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/conason/2009/08/07/clinton/?source=newsletter">Joe Conason of Salon</a> gets this one right.</p>
<blockquote><p>Here was an effort that exemplified the best of America &#8212; a society that values the lives of its citizens enough to send a former head of state, with all the power of government behind him, to the aid of two women in distress. Here was a happy reunion, bringing wives home to their husbands and a mother back to her little girl, that surely uplifted the spirit of anyone who actually believes in family values. Here was a moment of pride and joy.</p>
<p>But not for Gordon Liddy, the demented felon and radio bigot who <a target="_blank" href="http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200908050002">cackled about &#8220;Ling Ling and Wee Wee being locked up for nine hours in an airplane with Bill Clinton.&#8221;</a> Not for Rush Limbaugh, the obsessive guttersnipe who wondered aloud whether Clinton &#8220;hit on those two female journalists on the long flight home.&#8221; Not for Andrea Peyser, the curdled tabloid columnist who insisted that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/08062009/news/columnists/homecoming_drama_is_all_about_bubba_183219.htm">&#8220;the whole shebang was nakedly scripted and staged as a device to help rehabilitate the image of former President Bill Clinton&#8221;</a>(and who neglected to mention that Clinton did not speak to the eagerly waiting press corps and has given not a single interview on the North Korea mission). Not for Times columnist Maureen Dowd, who predictably seized on Clinton&#8217;s mission as an opportunity for gratuitous and ugly insults to his wife, weirdly imagining that the prisoner release was &#8220;some clever North Korean revenge plot, giving the limelight to Daddy to punish Mommy.&#8221; And not for the editors of the Huffington Post, who posted <a target="_blank" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0809/HuffPo_blogger_appalled_by_HuffPo_headline.html">a very strange headline</a> &#8212; &#8220;Bill Upstages Hillary &#8230; Once Again&#8221; &#8212; on an Associated Press story that didn’t mention her at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course the visit was scripted-it probably took a lot of negotiation. Such ex-presidential forays into particular situations has precedent for those who negotiate. But crude innuendo at the expense of these two women and their families is wrong.  And to be thinking that the visit was done without Department of State input and approval strikes me as stupid.  Let it be folks, your ratings are okay.</p>

                                <p>By Spencer,</p>
<p>The employment report was very encouraging.</p>
<p>Most importantly, aggregate hours worked were unchanged at 91.1 as compared to 104.1, 101.7 and 99.7 over the last three quarters.  An unchanged reading is a massive improvement from the 8% to 9% rate of decline over the past three quarters. With positive productivity this impies that thrird quarter real GDP growth could easily be positive..</p>
<p>Moreover, the manufacturing work week rose from 39.5 to 39.8 hours and overtime hours were 2.9 hours versus 2.8 in the second quarter.  Much of this was auto and confirms the other reports that at least auto output is rebounding.  The hours worked together with productivity strongly impies that manufacturing output rose in July &#8212; to be reported about mid-month. Moreover, the average workweek and overtime hours are traditional leading indicators.</p>

<p>With hours worked stable and hourly earnings rising average private weekly earnings rose from $611.49 to 614.34.  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SnwzmIutatI/AAAAAAAAA0s/AVTAeP60Igo/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SnwzmIutatI/AAAAAAAAA0s/AVTAeP60Igo/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The improvement in weekly earnings is a welcome sign for what I consider the greatest risk to the recovery, the unprecedented  decline in nominal, repeat nominal, income so far this year. For a sustained recovery nominal and real income growth has to improve at some point.  Normally, real income growth is a lagging indicator at bottoms but it also kicks in soon after the bottom. Tax cuts are offsetting some of this weakness but a sustained recovery requires growth in real income.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Snw5XRBm_hI/AAAAAAAAA1U/APDtGMIZSwI/s1600-h/Clipboard04.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/Snw5XRBm_hI/AAAAAAAAA1U/APDtGMIZSwI/s320/Clipboard04.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The consensus forecast is for a very weak recovery.  But the consensus forecast is always for a weak recovery.  The actual historic record is for recoveries to be proportional to the recession. That is, severe recessions have strong recoveries and mild recessions have weak recoveries.<br />I&#8217;m not making a forecast or taking a position that  the consensus is wrong, or that those who expect no recovery are wrong either. But at every bottom economists always have a long list of reasons why this recovery will be weak.  And they are usually wrong. In 1981, I won the National Association of Business Economists annual forecasting contest  by forecasting an average or normal recovery from the 1980 recession. It was the strongest forecast in the competition.</p>

<p>Footnote. Despite the increase in the minimum wage the teenage unemployment rate actually fell.</p>
