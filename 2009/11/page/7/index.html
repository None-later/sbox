                                <p>First, David Leonhardt <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/one-of-these-things-is-not-like-others.html">argued that <strong>this</strong> recession was good for workers</a>.  </p>
<p>Now, Floyd Norris apparently has decided <a target="_blank" href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/09/did-unemployment-really-rise/">to mix and match data</a>.  (I wonder if the fact many NYT employees who are looking at their 45-day severance offers is having an effect on its economic coverage.)</p>
<p>One of the standard &#8220;economist jokes&#8221; is about the one who died because he forgot to &#8220;seasonally adjust&#8221; his pool.  In that tradition, Norris declares:<br />
<blockquote>The adjustments are for seasonality. For some reason, October is the month with the largest seasonal adjustment down in jobs. So the increase in the unemployment rate does not reflect people actually losing jobs. It reflects the belief that seasonal factors should have added more jobs than they did.</p>
<p>All this may be very reasonable, and there is no way I can think of to test whether the seasonal adjustments are reliable. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Gosh, I wonder why October would have a larger seasonal adjustment, and whether there is any BLS data to support that adjustment?
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Svn9JVRXILI/AAAAAAAAATo/CxomfaTxGHg/s1600-h/NFPHiresNSA.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Svn9JVRXILI/AAAAAAAAATo/CxomfaTxGHg/s400/NFPHiresNSA.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SvoA0dU-MvI/AAAAAAAAATw/tybifsn0E6M/s1600-h/October+Effect.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SvoA0dU-MvI/AAAAAAAAATw/tybifsn0E6M/s400/October+Effect.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Apparently, employers traditionally hire a lot of people in October for &#8220;the Holiday Season.&#8221;  And while it&#8217;s possible that they will be doing all that hiring in November this year, it hasn&#8217;t been the way to bet during this millennium.</p>
<p>Norris continues:</p>
<blockquote><p> But I suspect seasonal factors are less important this year, when the economy may be changing directions, than they normally are.</p></blockquote>
<p>It was with such optimism that Napoleon went to Russia, people bought VA Linux at $100 a share, and the Bush/Cheney/Rumsfeld axis decided to run a two-front war in Afghanistan and Iraq. With statements similar to Norris&#8217;s:<br />
<blockquote>In reality, the government report says unemployment rates remained steady at 9.5 percent. And the number of jobs actually rose, by 80,000. And the number of jobs for college-educated Americans rose more than in any month in the last six years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, the number of jobs rose (as one would expect, given the Holiday Sales push) but Table B-1 is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t14.htm">closer to 40,000 than 80,000</a>:
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SvoKWlS2vkI/AAAAAAAAAUI/JvKse9yHeHs/s1600-h/B1.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SvoKWlS2vkI/AAAAAAAAAUI/JvKse9yHeHs/s400/B1.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Where we do see an 80,000 job increase is in the <em>private</em> sector, which is more than 500,000 workers lower than it was in August. If you want to play a non-seasonally adjusted, private-sector only game with the data, you should at least be honest about it.</p>
<p>More vitriol and data below the break.</p>
<p>The details of that 80,000 look even worse: declines in all Goods-producing areas (except about 200 new jobs in primary metals, 300 in &#8220;miscellaneous manufacturing,&#8221; and 1,100 in motor vehicles and parts; <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/evaluating-cash-for-clunkers-case-of.html">cash for clunkers</a>, anyone?) which are balanced by the Service sector, most notably the 63,500 new Retail jobs.  Can you say &#8220;seasonal employment&#8221;?  Floyd Norris apparently cannot.</p>
<p>The rest of the Non-Seasonally Adjusted figures are even less encouraging. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t08.htm">Table A-8</a> of the report shows more than 100,000 people added to &#8220;not on temporary layoff&#8221;:
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SvoEd3atwLI/AAAAAAAAAT4/baCQPJrYzEw/s1600-h/SepOctTableNSA.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SvoEd3atwLI/AAAAAAAAAT4/baCQPJrYzEw/s400/SepOctTableNSA.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>while <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t09.htm">Table A-9</a> is depressing: a larger number of unemployed at all durations, with the median duration of unemployment increased by more than one month (in a month):</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SvoGr_Eq91I/AAAAAAAAAUA/FNr4rg57xrk/s1600-h/A9.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SvoGr_Eq91I/AAAAAAAAAUA/FNr4rg57xrk/s400/A9.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And while the BLS has not updated their Job Openings data for October, the graphic through September isn&#8217;t exactly pointing to a decline in that median (or a robust recovery):</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SvoPdb5U_TI/AAAAAAAAAUQ/3Ybxod5D_aM/s1600-h/NFPOpeningsNSA.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SvoPdb5U_TI/AAAAAAAAAUQ/3Ybxod5D_aM/s400/NFPOpeningsNSA.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Is there a recovery in process? Maybe, though I&#8217;m not convinced, since most of the positive data seems, as <a target="_blank" href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/the-plural-of-anecdote-is-data/">Paul Krugman noted</a>, &#8220;unrepresentative.&#8221;</p>
<p>But things are not so good as Floyd Norris wants to pretend, even (or especially) using the data he chooses to highlight.</p></p>

<blockquote>Everyone,</p>
<p>    Over the weekend, eight of us who worked on the Greenspan commission drafted a joint written statement (attached and pasted below.)<br />We have just submitted it to the Budget Committee.  We are hoping it gets as wide a distribution as possible.  In that regard, if any of you are able to post it on your web sites, and get it in the hands of bloggers, reporters, etc., I and the other signatories would really appreciate it.</p>

<p>(Update: the below now available as an linkable online Doc: http://docs.google.com/View?id=dc36qc9g_1crqqnpdt )<br />STATEMENT OF<br />STAFF TO THE 1981-83 NATIONAL COMMISSION<br />ON SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM</p>
<p>HEARING ON BIPARTISAN PROCESS PROPOSALS<br />FOR LONG-TERM FISCAL STABILITY</p>
<p>THE BUDGET COMMITTEE<br />U.S. SENATE</p>
<p>NOVEMBER 10, 2009</p>
<p>Chairman Conrad, Ranking Member Gregg, and Members of the Committee:</p>
<p>This statement represents the views of eight individuals who helped craft and secure the enactment of the Social Security Amendments of 1983.[1]  Those amendments, which followed the recommendations of the National Commission on Social Security Reform (the so-called Greenspan commission), eliminated Social Security’s then-projected short-range and long-range shortfalls.  Our involvement with the Commission’s work may provide useful insights into the advisability of using a commission or task force to eliminate, as part of an effort to control the overall federal deficit, the long-range shortfall now being projected for Social Security.  Social Security’s current projected shortfall, it should be noted, is much less immediate and severe than the shortfall Congress eliminated twenty-six years ago.    </p>
<p>Fast-Tracking Social Security Legislation Is Unprecedented</p>
<p>An expedited procedure, which limits debate and prohibits all amendments, would be unprecedented: Since its enactment in 1935, Social Security legislation has always had the benefit of (1) full hearings before the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee; (2) executive sessions which provided all members the opportunity to offer amendments; (3) unlimited debate and opportunity for amendments in the Senate; and (4) debate and amendment in the House of Representatives, consistent with its rules.  This was the procedure that was followed in the enactment of the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which eliminated the then-projected Social Security deficit. </p>
<p> Throughout Social Security’s long history, advisory councils have been used frequently to recommend changes.  Congress has always used the normal legislative process when considering those recommendations.  The normal legislative process was followed in 1983, when Congress considered the Greenspan commission recommendations.   Indeed, the decision to raise the retirement age was the result not of a commission recommendation, but of an amendment offered by Representative J.J. “Jake” Pickle (D-TX) during consideration of the legislation on the floor of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p>The Greenspan Commission Succeeded Because of its Broad, Diverse Composition</p>
<p>In addition to recommending that the normal legislative process be employed, we advise that any task force or commission that is established with respect to Social Security be broadly representative, including members from business, labor, and the general public.  This was the composition of successful Social Security advisory councils and commissions of the past, including the Greenspan commission.    </p>
<p>Part of the success of the Greenspan commission was its diverse membership, which included the then-President of the AFL-CIO, Lane Kirkland; four business leaders, including the then-President of the National Association of Manufacturers, Alexander Trowbridge; a leading advocate for the elderly, then-Congressman Claude Pepper (D-FL); and a leading women’s advocate, former Congresswoman Martha Keys (D-KS).   We believe that good public policymaking demands that any Social Security task force or commission be broadly representative of labor, business, seniors, women, and other groups vitally affected by Social Security.</p>
<p>Base Closure and Realignment Commission Analogy Overlooks Fundamental Differences  <br />Those who advocate a fast-tracked procedure for reform of Social Security and other entitlements frequently invoke the example of the Base Closure and Realignment Commission (“BRAC”).  The political context and constitutional structure of BRAC, however, are completely different.   Because the national interest in closing unnecessary bases was in sharp tension with preventing the adverse and localized economic consequences of closing a particular base, success depended on all members agreeing to elevate national interest over local interest   This posed a classic prisoner’s dilemma: If only some members acted in the national interest and against the localized interest of those they represented, while others acted solely in defense of their localized interest, the ones acting in the national interest would “lose,” because the national interest would be defeated but their local interest would not be protected.   Consequently, without a mechanism to require everyone to act in the national interest, the natural tendency would be to engage in logrolling, forming alliances to prevent one’s own base from being closed, and the obvious result would have been that no base would be closed.  BRAC provided a mechanism which permitted escape from this prisoner’s dilemma.  An impartial expert panel determined which bases to close and Congress agreed in advance to accept the entire package of recommendations unless a majority of both Houses objected in a single up-or-down vote.    </p>
<p>In stark contrast to base closings, where local and national interests may diverge, local and national interests are aligned perfectly with respect to Social Security, because every state and every district includes beneficiaries and FICA-paying workers.  Consequently, every member of Congress has comparable interests and concerns, though, of course, they may differ on principles and preferences.  Those principles and preferences should be open to full unrestricted deliberation in the Congress.  Members have been elected to apply their principles and preferences to hard decisions; a commission with responsibility over Social Security, where its recommendations are considered under expedited procedures with no power to amend, improperly shifts responsibility and shields members from accountability.</p>
<p>In the case of the base closings, Congress could have simply provided guidelines and delegated the decision to the Department of Defense.  Instead, Congress chose to retain greater control and accountability by establishing a commission and preserving the power to reject, on an all-or-nothing basis, its determination.   Unlike the decision about which specific bases to close, Congress lacks the constitutional authority simply to delegate the decision to change Social Security’s income or outgo.  Exercise of the power to tax and spend under Article I of the Constitution requires that Congress itself, not a delegate of Congress, make the relevant decisions and take full constitutional responsibility for them, together with full accountability.    </p>
<p>Establishing a commission and considering its recommendations under expedited, extraordinary rules blurs accountability and therefore breaches the spirit of that basic principle of constitutional accountability.  History shows that Social Security reform can take place through the normal legislative process, without recourse to extraordinary arrangements.  We witnessed it in 1983. </p>
<p>Social Security’s Vital Importance to the Nation Requires Public Accountability</p>
<p>Because Americans in the last year have lost trillions of dollars in home equity and retirement savings, it is more important than ever that Social Security reform be addressed in the sunshine.   Social Security today provides an economic lifeline more crucial than ever to the millions who receive its benefits and the millions more who are insured in the event they, or workers on whom they depend, lose wages as a result of disability, premature death, or old-age.  In 2009, more than 52 million people are receiving monthly benefits, including 33 million retired workers, 2.4 million spouses or divorced spouses of retired workers, 4.4 million aged widow(er)s, 7.7 million disabled workers, and 4.1 million children of deceased, disabled or retired workers. </p>
<p>Our brave soldiers wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan receive Social Security benefits, as do their spouses and children, and so do the families of soldiers who have given their lives in defense of the nation.  Though little noted, Social Security continues to provide benefits to the families of those who lost their lives in the 9/11 attacks.   Its benefits &#8212; which are crucial to the vast majority of its beneficiaries and the communities in which they live and spend &#8212; are modest by any measure.  Indeed, average benefits are less than what is paid for full-time minimum-wage work.  Nor is there waste: the program is efficient, returning in benefits more than 99 cents of every dollar collected in income. </p>
<p>The importance of Social Security demands that proposals for change receive careful consideration, with public participation through its representative groups, so that the implications of all changes are closely examined and clearly understood.  Any kind of expedited procedure would be a disservice to the American people.</p>
<p>Social Security, Currently in Surplus,  Is Not Part of the Deficit Problem</p>
<p>Moreover, there is no need for hasty action with respect to the program.  Social Security is currently in surplus.  According to the 2009 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees, published May 12, 2009, Social Security ran a surplus of $180 billion last year and had accumulated a reserve of $2.4 trillion.   (Even excluding the interest income, there was still a surplus of $64 billion.) [2]    The Trustees’ Report projects that Social Security’s accumulated reserve will continue to grow until about 2024,[3] and, the program can continue to pay full benefits until 2037 to the millions of children, disabled workers, retired workers, and spouses (including widowed and divorced spouses) dependent on those benefits.  Indeed, the most recent projections of the Congressional Budget Office, published in August, forecast that full benefits can continue to be paid until 2043.  Consequently, Congress has the time to undertake careful, deliberate action through the normal legislative process.</p>
<p>Social Security Is Already Prohibited under Current Law from Deficit Spending</p>
<p>Though few realize it, Social Security already contains an automatic built-in trigger to restore it to balance, if it should ever have insufficient assets to cover scheduled benefits.   The law prohibits Social Security from paying any benefits with respect to which it has insufficient revenue.  Consequently, if at any point in the future, it has insufficient revenue to cover the costs of benefits, those benefits will be automatically reduced, without any action by Congress.</p>
<p>Social Security Helped the Country Avoid a 1930s-Style Depression</p>
<p>The recession that almost turned into a depression holds lessons for the future.  The banking and financial systems almost collapsed, requiring unprecedented federal help.  Millions of Americans lost trillions of dollars in private pension wealth.  In fortunate contrast, Social Security proved rock solid, providing guaranteed benefits that help offset lost earnings and stimulate the economy by maintaining purchasing power.   Hidden in the shadows of the unemployment and foreclosure statistics of the 1930s were elderly parents dependent on and living with adult workers.    That added suffering has been largely avoided today, thanks to Social Security.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, while we support efforts to bring the federal deficit under control, we urge members of this Committee and all members of Congress to refrain from employing a fast-tracked procedure for Social Security, and instead allow Congress to consider Social Security legislation through the normal procedure which has resulted in successful legislation in the past.[4]</p>

<p>[1] Seven of the eight signatories of this statement served on the staff of the Greenspan commission.  Nancy J. Altman, J.D. served as executive assistant to Alan Greenspan, who chaired the Commission;  Merton C. Bernstein, LL.B.., Coles Professor of Law Emeritus, Washington University, served as principal consultant to the Commission; Suzanne M. Blouin served as executive assistant to Robert J. Myers who was executive director of the Commission; Elizabeth T. Duskin served as Senior Staff Adviser to the Commission; Lori L. Hansen served as technical adviser to Commission Member Robert M. Ball; Eric Kingson, Ph.D., Professor of Social Work, Syracuse University, served as policy advisor to the Commission; and Bruce D. Schobel, FSA, served as staff actuary to the Commission.  The eighth signatory of this statement is Patricia E. Dilley, J.D., LL.M, Professor of Law, University of Florida, who served as professional staff to the Subcommittee on Social Security of the Ways and Means Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives from 1981 to 1987, and worked closely with the staff of the Greenspan commission.</p>
<p>[2] While Social Security is in surplus with or without inclusion of its investment income, we believe that the investment income should be treated identically to all other sources of income.  Some have argued that Social Security’s investment income should be ignored because it involves inter-fund transfers which are not shown when the federal budget is displayed on a unitary basis and are irrelevant for the limited exercise of macroeconomic analysis.  In contrast, we believe that in determining the financial status of Social Security, it is illogical to exclude its investment income, which has been a source of Social Security revenue starting in 1937, and is dedicated, by law, to the exclusive use of its beneficiaries.<br />[3] See footnote 2.<br />[4] We have limited our statement to Social Security, but many of the same arguments apply to other programs, such as Medicare.   It too is vitally important to the nation, has lower administrative costs than private insurance despite its coverage of the most expensive part of the population, and has rising costs primarily as a result of the same pressures that are driving up the nation’s health care costs, private as well as public.  Like Social Security, it has never been subject to an expedited fast-track procedure.  The only reason to subject it to one seems to be simple avoidance of accountability.</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>An AP story (via <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2009/11/09/cash-for-clunkers-datapoint-of-the-day/">Felix Salmon</a>) based on an analysis of &#8220;Cash for Clunkers&#8221; transactions is circulating with the non-news that a number of the transactions involved trades of gas-guzzling trucks for only modestely less gas-guzzling trucks.  Here&#8217;s the lede:<br />
<blockquote>The most common deals under the government&#8217;s $3 billion Cash for Clunkers program, aimed at putting more fuel-efficient cars on the road, replaced old Ford or Chevrolet pickups with new ones that got only marginally better gas mileage, according to an analysis of new federal data by The Associated Press&#8230;</p>
<p>The single most common swap — which occurred more than 8,200 times — involved Ford F-150 pickup owners who&#8230; trade[d] their old trucks for new Ford F-150s. They were 17 times more likely to buy a new F-150 than, say, a Toyota Prius&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoa now.  It isn&#8217;t until the 6th paragraph that readers are told the analysis involves more than 677,000 transactions, so the most common swap accounts for just 1.2 percent of cash-for-clunkers transactions.  The seventh paragraph finally deigns to mention the average fuel economy statistics: 15.8 mpg for the traded clunkers, 24.9 mpg for the purchased vehicles — if you invert the mpgs, that&#8217;s a 36.5% reduction in fuel consumption at the means.</p>
<p>Salmon for whatever reason reckons this makes cash-for-clunkers the administration&#8217;s worst policy initiative yet, which brings a <a href="http://blog.internetnews.com/apatrizio/orly_owl.html">lolcritter</a> to mind.  Even William Buiter granted in an <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/03/please-torch-my-car/">otherwise cranky post </a>that, under conditions clearly met by the program (i.e. a temporary incentive that&#8217;s big enough),  the programs  are &#8220;bound to work&#8221; as Keynesian stimulus which arguably the administration hasn&#8217;t pursued in sufficient quantity.  [*]</p>
<p>More below the jump.</p>
<p>None of this is news because the ability to trade old trucks for slightly more fuel-efficient new trucks was a widely reported feature of the enacted program design, which was biased towards the stimulus end of things, given the truck-heavy product lines of the domestic three.  Participants could get $3,500 for a 1 mpg improvement in a light truck-for-light truck trade.   Still, program participants generally used the credits for something better than 2 mpg improvements.

<p>The distribution is a bit bimodal, with peaks at 6 and 11 mpg improvements; the latter is the most common swap in mpg improvement terms, or to borrow the AP article&#8217;s reporting style, that&#8217;s around 9 times more common than F-150 for F-150 trades.  Fuel economy improvements of more than 30 mpg over the trade-in vehicle (roughly, trading a very large truck for a Prius) are more common than F-150 for F-150 trades.  The 1 mpg minimum improvement likewise was not overly common at 1.51 percent of transactions.<br /><br />In addition, fuel consumption reductions and stimulus aren&#8217;t the only potential benefits from the program.  While current emissions regulations hold light trucks to the same standard as cars for regulated pollutants (as of 2009, in fact, though notably not [yet] including carbon dioxide), trucks previously were allowed to meet lower emissions standards.  All cars and light trucks have been held to higher standards since the mid-1990s as <a href="http://www.epa.gov/air/caa/caaa_overview.html#titleII">stricter emissions regulations</a> have phased in.  Indeed, as the following table shows, fully 30 percent of trades predate the 1994 start of the phase-in for the Tier 1 emissions regulations.  New <a href="http://www.epa.gov/tier2/basicinfo.htm">Tier 2</a> vehicles are much cleaner than pre-MY2003 vehicles, which account for 99 percent of Clunkers trades.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also a cautionary lesson in here investigating large databases.  In a 677,000-record dataset, there will be hundreds or thousands of errors unless the data are meticulously cleaned.  The AP report takes note of the 145 transactions listed above where the mileage of the trade was no worse than that of the new vehicle, which could indicate frauds against the program if correct.  Among the putative horror stories:<br />
<blockquote>A driver in Negaunee, Mich., traded a 1987 Suburban that got 18 mpg for $3,500 toward a new Silverado pickup that got only 15 mpg. An Indianapolis driver traded a 1985 Mercedes 190 that got 27 mpg for $3,500 toward a new Volkswagen Rabbit that got only 24 mpg.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article is correct based on the mpg for the trades as coded in the database.  However, other information in the database suggests that the transactions actually may have involved valid fuel economy improvements.   The database includes the vehicle identification number (VIN) of the trade, which provides important eligibility information on the cars when decoded.</p>
<p>In the case of the 1987 Suburban, to get 18 mpg it would need to be a RWD model equipped with a 6.2-liter diesel engine.  That&#8217;s what the database record says, but according to the VIN, the Suburban was a 13 mpg gas-engined model.  Likewise, the VIN of the 1985 Mercedes is consistent with the car being an eligible 18 mpg gas-engined 190 rather than a 27 mpg diesel 190.  In both cases, the database is ambiguous as to the validity of the transactions; if the VINs are correct, then they were allowable.</p>
<p>The Cash for Clunkers program pretty clearly was not designed as an efficient environmental program, and there have been questions as to its efficiency as stimulus, too.  However, as its costs are spread over aims of stimulus, reducing fuel consumption (which has costs external to car owners), and reducing emissions pollutants other than fuel consumption-related GHGs, it doesn&#8217;t have to be. To call it the Worst Obama Program Ever is to go overboard.</p>
<p>[*] Buiter, who takes the line that it&#8217;s crazy per se to destroy a portion of the capital stock, doesn&#8217;t carefully consider that automobiles don&#8217;t just magically produce transportation services; they consume other inputs and emit various wastes doing so.</p>

<p>Martin Ford continues his theme in the following post, on comparative advantage:</p>
<p>More on the Looming Structural Unemployment Crisis, and on Comparative Advantage</p>
<p>In my <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/could-advancing-job-automation.html">previous post</a>, I suggested that job automation technology might someday advance to the point where most routine or repetitive jobs will be performed by machines or software, and that, as a result, we may end up with a serious structural unemployment problem. I’d like to respond to some of the objections that were raised regarding that idea. </p>
<p>I thought I would start with a response at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/11/rethinking_the_luddites.cfm"> Economist’s Free Exchange</a> blog, which said:</p>
<blockquote><p>… in general I am pretty sanguine about the long-term prospects for continued voluntary employment of humans. Technology isn&#8217;t free, and even if we arrive at a world where some pieces of technology are better at everything than humans, the principle of comparative advantage nonetheless suggests that people will find work.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea is that, since everyone has a comparative advantage in something, just about everyone should be able to find some sort of a job. Thus we can be “sanguine.” Nearly every explanation of comparative advantage I have seen involves either individual people or countries. I haven’t seen examples where machines or automation technology come into play, so I thought I’d take a shot at it here.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a tractor and a team of oxen. Both can be used to plow fields, pull wagons or do other things around the farm. Clearly, the tractor out-performs the oxen in every task. Still, there ought to be some area in which the oxen don’t perform quite so badly relative to the tractor. Maybe the tractor is a little less efficient at plowing smaller fields since it has to make many turns. Or maybe fuel for the tractor is much more expensive in some regions, and so the oxen ought, in those cases, to have some sort of comparative advantage. So why have oxen been completely put out of work in developed countries like the United States?</p>
<p>It seems to me that there are two reasons. First, there is the magnitude of the absolute advantage that the tractor has. A tractor is a disruptive technology relative to the oxen. In order to have a meaningful comparative advantage, it’s probably helpful if you can get fairly close to the competition in at least one area. </p>
<p>The second reason is, perhaps, even more important: tractors, being machines, can be replicated on demand. If we imagine that a shortage of tractors existed, then comparative advantage would work. The available tractors would be deployed in their most productive uses, and the remaining work might well go to the oxen. But, in reality, the farmer can acquire as many tractors as he needs to do all his work, and in fact, he has no choice but to do so in order to remain competitive with other farmers. </p>
<p>As another example, suppose you are a brain surgeon who is also an excellent cook. Now, you might choose to employ a cook who is not quite as good as you are because doing so would free up your time and energy to do more brain surgery. So comparative advantage works there. But suppose you develop a machine (or two machines) with a dramatic absolute advantage in both cooking and brain surgery. Then, you could  replicate your machine, and pretty soon there would be no jobs for cooks or brain surgeons. </p>
<p>So it seems like that might be a rule: If an affordable machine (or software algorithm) achieves a dramatic absolute advantage in a job or task, it will most likely be replicated and deployed until all competitors are eliminated. Comparative advantage is not much of a defense against that.</p>
<p>It seems to me that over time (not next week, but over years and decades), machines and software automation applications are likely to achieve that type of dominance in a great many areas, and they will be replicated until they consume all the available work. Any enterprise that failed to deploy this new technology would be less competitive.</p>
<p>All of this, of course, really amounts to nothing more than a restatement of the principle of obsolescence: in the long run, disruptive new technologies don’t find an equilibrium with old technologies. Old technologies get replaced. This applies equally to biological technologies like oxen—and perhaps it will someday even apply to human workers. </p>
<p>That’s an idea that economics is probably not ready to accept. Interestingly, other disciplines like biology or physics don’t give any special status to people. We are assumed to be subject to the same overall rules of nature as anything else. No so, with economics. For economists, people are very special; people are labor, and people get a special “L” in all the equations. Economists assume that people—and not just a few people but the vast majority of available workers—are indispensable to the production process. That has been true historically, but <a target="_blank" href="http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2009/10/23/how-will-technology-affect-society-in-the-future/">will it always be true</a>?</p>
<p>Then again, maybe I’ve missed something. Maybe there is an area where human workers will always have an absolute advantage: in jobs that require uniquely human qualities or creativity, artistic ability and so forth. A lot of the conventional wisdom seems to suggest that we simply need to retrain, re-educate and redeploy workers into these areas, and everything will be fine. Is that likely to be the case? I’ll look at that idea in my next post.<br />__________________________<br />Martin Ford is the author of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thelightsinthetunnel.com/">The Lights in the Tunnel: Automation, Accelerating Technology and the Economy of the Future</a> and has a blog at <a target="_blank" href="http://econfuture.wordpress.com/">Econfuture</a></p>

<p>The Changing Face of Health Care Fraud</p>
<p>Every President since Gerald Ford has campaigned against Medicare and Medicaid “waste, fraud and abuse.” Ditto many people campaigning for Congress.</p>
<p>The primary fraud prevention systems are aimed at providers, with the Office of Inspector General  (DHHS – CMS) and the FBI taking the lead on large fraud cases. States are also very active in Medicaid fraud investigations. Providers spend vast sums every year to prevent fraud, usually in the form of compliance plan activity.</p>
<p>The leading presumption is fraud will be perpetrated by providers via double billing, upcoding, kickbacks, and etc., but the face of  health care fraud is changing.</p>
<p>Exact numbers are hard to find, but by monitoring several sources it appears non-providers (some mobbed up and some immigrant groups) are combining ID theft and computer driven fraud to suck funds out of Medicare and Medicaid.</p>
<p>60 Minutes did a program recently on phony pharmacies and DME* shops in Miami, and one informant guessed there may be 2000 phony shops in the Miami area alone. Wow.</p>
<p>The key is to do a real credentialing process before issuing a provider ID number. Physicians jump many hurdles to get a number, despite piles of  credentialing paperwork, but apparently phony suppliers can begin billing almost immediately.</p>
<p>The feds are still aiming at legitimate providers with the Revenue Audit Contractor (RAC) program. Likely the contractors will find some billing errors at every single provider, sweeping up crumbs while real criminals are abusing the treasury.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>by cactus</p>
<p>Recently the ex-GF and I were traveling, and we ended up flying on United.  I haven’t flown on United in recent years, as it hasn’t been a major carrier in a number of the places I’ve lived recently.  Now maybe things have changed since the previous time I was in a plane (a month earlier, Delta Airlines) but it seems to me that United is taking a la carte pricing a bit further than other airlines.</p>
<p>When we went through automatic check-in, we were offered two different choices for upgraded leg-room.  We were also charged $20 buck for checking one bag.  It wasn’t overweight, it is just that now there is a charge for luggage.</p>
<p>It seems most people on that flight were aware of the $20 charge; overhead compartments were filled up completely, mostly with “carry-on” bags significantly larger than the one piece of luggage we had checked.   As a result, a number of people had to check bags at the gate.  Now here is the interesting thing…  because so many people had to check bags at the gate, and those bags had to be available upon deplaning, none of us were allowed to exit the aircraft until after the bags that had been gate checked were brought up.   Because so many people were trying to avoid a) waiting at the baggage carousel and b) paying twenty bucks for a piece of luggage, everyone had to wait longer.   Perverse incentives lead to undesirable outcomes.</p>
<p>I don’t think the a la carte pricing is working so well in other ways either.  See, on the flight back, I had the seat with the most leg room in the entire plane – I was sitting in the emergency row.  And I wasn’t charged extra for it either.  See, we had the opportunity to leave early, which means we flew standby.  We were literally assigned the last two seats on the entire plane…  and nobody who had the opportunity to do so had paid for the upgrade, so the emergency row was all that was available.</p>
<p>My guess is that the perennial problems of the airline industry are self-inflicted, and date back to the period when the industry was deregulated.  Until deregulation occurred, prices were set by government fiat, and airlines could only differentiate themselves on quality.  After deregulation, they began competing on price.  Companies that had previously trained their passengers to believe that flying was a special occasion that merited wearing formal attire retrained their passengers to think about price alone.   When you make your product or service into a commodity, prices drop to marginal cost and that means if you have the kind of fixed costs the airline industry does, profits have to go negative.</p>
<p>So…  if you were an executive at an airline, what would you do to change the passenger mindset?  What can you convince the <strikethrough>cattle</strikethrough> passengers to pay for, and how?  For what it is worth, I can’t imagine how any airline executive should earn more than minimum wage if they can’t come up with a credible answer to those questions.  Slowly taking their companies bankrupt is something anyone can do.<br />____________________________________________<br />by cactus</p>
<p>(Rdan here&#8230;leaving for Chicago this week, and Southwest has an option for $10/person to upgrade to the A line so to speak from B and C lines, which determines when you can board.  There is <i>no limit to who can purchase the upgrade</i> to the A line, so there is no guarantee the A line won&#8217;t include everyone if everyone upgrades, which is allowed to date.  It presents an interesting pricing dilemma as well.)</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I try to like the NYTimes Economics Reporting.  I really do.  Heck, any place that publishes <a target="_blank" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/author/uwe-e-reinhardt/">Uwe Reinhardt</a> can&#8217;t be all bad.</p>
<p>But David Leonhardt, as he does often enough that I hesitate to read his work, again <a target="_blank" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/06/wages-a-comparison-with-past-recessions/">goes beyond the pale today, and clearly does so deliberately</a>.  The offending paragraph:<br />
<blockquote>Twenty-two months after the start of the mid-1970s recession, real weekly pay was down 7 percent. For the early 1980s recession, the decline was 4 percent. Today, thanks to moderate pay growth and scant inflation, pay is 1 percent higher than when the Great Recession began in December 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s (1) remember that wages are sticky and (2) look at this declaration.</p>
<p>Both of the previous recessions are cited as being about 16 months.  The current one probably ran 18 for economists&#8217;s purposes, and is in its 23rd month for the rest of us.  But let&#8217;s give him a pass on that.</p>
<p>Note, however, the careful phrasing at the end of the paragraph: &#8220;thanks to moderate pay growth and scant inflation.&#8221;  What does that mean? Well, let&#8217;s look at the Annual inflation Rate (CPI) for the actual recessions under discussion:
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Svcx-spMdCI/AAAAAAAAATg/Jbsg4TmMNI0/s1600-h/CPIsLeonhardt.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Svcx-spMdCI/AAAAAAAAATg/Jbsg4TmMNI0/s400/CPIsLeonhardt.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Gosh; quite a difference!  I wonder if Leonhardt is aware of it.</p>
<p>A finger exercise below the fold.</p>
<p>Just for fun, let&#8217;s look at the wage changes over those periods. Now, unlike Leonhardt, I&#8217;m not going to use real wages.  Let&#8217;s see if we can figure out what the <em>nominal</em> change in wages is for each of those periods.*</p>
<p>1973-1975  Average Inflation Rate: 10.75.  Real wage loss: 7% Wage increase in period: 3.75% (including the residual effects of wage and price controls)</p>
<p>1980-1982:  Average Inflation Rate: 7.5%  Real wage loss:  4%  Wage increase in period: 3.5%</p>
<p>2007-present: Average Inflation Rate:  1.8%  Real wage gain: 1%  Wage increase in period: 2.8%</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about anyone else, but I wouldn&#8217;t be celebrating the wage &#8220;gains&#8221; of the current era.  (And let&#8217;s not even talk about actual wages received, since <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2009/11/nfpunemployment-charts-get-fugly/">Barry Ritholz has that territory well-covered</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2009/11/even-more-unemployment-charts/">and then some</a>).</p>
<p>*If you want to make the case that I should be using real wages, as Leonhardt does, please demonstrate (a) that all wages are renegotiated during a period of inflation, (b) that all parties are able to estimate inflation—even when at relatively unprecedented levels—accurately, and (c) that such negotiations were legally and commercially allowed during the period.</p>
