<p>Martin Ford offers one man&#8217;s look into the future of a world in the USA of the results of continued increasing productivity, increasing income inequality, declining wage compensation, and consumption supported by debt.</p>
<p>Robert touched on the issue <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/vague-thoughts-on-theory-of-firm.html">recently</a>, and Sandwichman has developed a range of thoughts on labor at Econospeak.  One post cannot handle the complexities, but here is a start to the conversation.</p>
<blockquote><p>Could Advancing Job Automation Technology Cause Structural Unemployment?</p>
<p>The unemployment situation is looking increasingly dismal. Is it possible that there&#8217;s something going on that no one wants to acknowledge? </p>
<p>There can be little doubt that computers, robotic technologies and other forms of job automation have been getting far more capable and that as this trend continues, more workers are certain to be displaced in the relatively near future. Most economists dismiss any concern that this might lead to long-term structural unemployment. At the risk of being labeled a &#8220;neo-Luddite,&#8221; I&#8217;d like to explore this issue a little further. </p>
<p>I think I can make a fairly strong argument that a very large percentage of jobs are, on some level, essentially routine and repetitive in nature. In other words, the job can be broken down into a discrete set of tasks that tend to get repeated on a regular basis. It seems likely that, as both hardware and software continue to advance, a large fraction of these job types are ultimately going to be susceptible to machine or software automation. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not talking about far fetched science fiction-level technology here: this is really a simple extrapolation of the expert systems and specialized algorithms that can currently land jet airplanes, trade autonomously on Wall Street, or beat nearly any human being at a game of chess. As technology progresses, I think there is little doubt that these systems will begin to match or exceed the capability of human workers in many routine job categories&#8211;and this includes a lot of workers with college degrees or other significant training. Many workers will also be increasingly threatened by the continuing trend toward self-service technologies that push tasks onto consumers. </p>
<p>One of the most extreme historical examples of technologically induced job losses is, of course, the mechanization of agriculture. In the late 1800s, about three quarters of workers in the U.S. were employed in agriculture. Today, the number is around 2-3%. Advancing technology irreversibly eliminated millions of jobs. </p>
<p>Obviously, when agriculture mechanized, we did not end up with long-term structural unemployment. Workers were absorbed by other industries, and average wages and overall prosperity increased dramatically. The historical experience with agriculture is, in fact, an excellent illustration of the so-called &#8220;Luddite fallacy.&#8221; This is the idea&#8211;and I think it is generally accepted by economists&#8211;that technological progress will never lead to massive, long-term unemployment.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind the Luddite fallacy goes roughly like this: As labor-saving technologies improve, some workers lose their jobs in the short run, but production also becomes more efficient. That leads to lower prices for the goods and services produced, and that, in turn, leaves consumers with more money to spend on other things. When they do so, demand increases across nearly all industries&#8211;and that means more jobs. That seems to be exactly what happened with agriculture: food prices fell as efficiency increased, and then consumers went out and spent their extra money elsewhere, driving increased employment in the manufacturing and service sectors. </p>
<p>The question we have to ask is whether or not that same scenario is likely to play out again. The problem is that this time we are not talking about a single industry being automated: these technologies are going to penetrate across the board. When agriculture mechanized, there were clearly other labor intensive sectors capable of absorbing the workers. There&#8217;s little evidence to suggest that&#8217;s going to be the case this time around. </p>
<p>It seems to me that, as automation penetrates nearly everywhere, there must come a &#8220;tipping point,&#8221; beyond which the overall economy is simply not labor intensive enough to continue absorbing workers who lose their jobs due to automation (or globalization). Beyond this point, businesses will be able to ramp up production primarily by employing machines and software&#8211;and structural unemployment then becomes inevitable.</p>
<p>If we reach that point, then I think we also have a serious problem with consumer demand. If automation is relentless, then the basic mechanism that gets purchasing power into the hands of consumers begins to break down.  As a thought experiment, imagine a fully automated economy. Virtually no one would have a job (or an income); machines would do everything. So where would consumption come from? If we&#8217;re still considering a market (rather than a planned) economy, why would production continue if there weren&#8217;t any viable consumers to purchase the output? Long before we reached that extreme point of full automation, it seems pretty clear that mass-market business models would become unsustainable. </p>
<p>One of the things that concerns me the most about this scenario is the potential influence of consumer psychology. If at some point in the future consumers look out the window and see a landscape where jobs are relentlessly getting automated away, and if it appears that getting additional education or training provides little protection, there&#8217;s likely to be a significant negative impact on consumer sentiment and discretionary spending. If we someday get into a reinforcing cycle driven by fear of automation, a very dark scenario could ensue. It&#8217;s difficult to see how traditional policies like stimulus spending or tax cuts would be effective because they wouldn&#8217;t address consumers&#8217; concerns about long-term income continuity.</p>
<p>Most economists will likely object to my arguments here as speculative and lacking in objective data. I think that if you look at issues like stagnating or declining wages for average workers, growing income inequality, increasing productivity, and consumption supported by debt rather than income, you can certainly find evidence that generally suggests we might be approaching that &#8220;tipping point&#8221; where structural unemployment is going to become a problem. However, it seems unlikely that an econometric analysis of past data is going offer clear support for this theory&#8211;and if it ever does, it will be very late in the game. </p>
<p>I wonder about the wisdom of the extreme emphasis on quantitative data analysis that seems to characterize economics. Should we really steer the ship exclusively by focusing our telescope on the wake? There might be an iceberg ahead.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Bruce Webb put up a post titled &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/10/health-care-exchange-eligibility-vs.html">Health Care Exchange: Eligibility vs. Enrollment</a>&#8220;.  I have gained some clarification on the subject and have shared it with Bruce.  I have asked him to comment also.</p>
<p>There is a concern as to whether access to the Public Option (PO) was limited.  Bruce&#8217;s reading of the bill was that everyone has access to the PO based on section 411(3) which reads:<br />
<blockquote>3) CONTRIBUTION IN LIEU OF COVERAGE.— <br />Beginning with Y2, if an employee declines such offer but otherwise obtains coverage in an Exchange- participating health benefits plan (other than by reason of being covered by family coverage as a spouse or dependent of the primary insured), the employer shall make a timely contribution to the Health Insurance Exchange with respect to each such employee in accordance with section 413.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, the PO is not as restricted as people thought and in the future the possibility is that it could grow and be what people are saying it would be; a force for controlling costs, especially regarding insurance premiums.  Sounds good, no?</p>
<p>My reading was that section 411(3) was tied in some way to whether your employer was &#8220;exchange eligible&#8221; or not.  There are provisions that would allow all employers in the future to be exchange eligible but it is dependent on a report or two being produced and then the &#8220;commissioner&#8221; acting on the report or congress acting on the report.  To me, this leaves too much political wiggle room.  </p>
<p>I think we both assumed that exchange eligible or not, if the employee chose the PO, the employer would have to pay for the choice by paying into the exchange, the result being that the cost to the employee would be the same regardless of what decision said employee makes.</p>
<p>Well, Bruce was correct.  Everyone has the option to choose the PO.  Though there is a financial barrier.  A big financial barrier that in my opinion makes this bill crap.  I&#8217;ll post my thoughts more on this later.</p>
<p>I contacted my congress person&#8217;s office.  They put me in touch with their legislative person.  I asked this person (via email) which of us were correct.  </p>
<p>Turns out, as noted, Bruce is correct that everyone has the option for the PO.  However, if you make this choice in lieu of  accepting one of the employer provided options you, my friend are on your own.  You are on your own and will have to accept the total cost of the PO plan because the payment your employer makes into the exchange does not follow you.</p>
<p>The reason given for such a set up in the house bill is that there is concern that the employers would push their employees into the exchange.  The legislative person noted that HR 3962 specifically is attempting to discourage this.  </p>
<p>This is the essential two responses by the legislative person:<br />
<blockquote>Any individual (but not any employer) can participate in the Exchange and therefore could sign up for the public option.  BUT, to do so, they would have to dis-enroll in their qualifying coverage and meet the other requirements necessary to participate in the Exchange.  However, there is zero incentive for anyone to do this since they’d be responsible for 100% of the cost of the care they chose in the Exchange.  If they stuck with their employer sponsored or other qualifying care, the vast majority of the cost of coverage is picked up by someone other than the individual.  That’s why so few people are projected to enter into the public option.  Additionally, access to the Exchange, and the public option, IS restricted for employers.  Only the smallest businesses can use it at first, and later slightly larger businesses.  The Secretary can then choose to open it up to all employers if she feels the Exchange has the capacity to handle that.  The goal is to do so.  </p></blockquote>
<p>I then asked: <em>411(3) notes that the employer has to make a contribution to the exchange following the rules of section 413 if the employee chooses to get health care via such.  How does this square with your statement that the employee would be 100% responsible for the cost of the exchange coverage?  Is the employer contribution not tied to their employee&#8217;s choice?  That is, the employer is just simply being charged as a participate in the over all exchange pool to provide the exchange money and thus the payment is not an offset of the cost incurred by the employee to purchase coverage from the exchange?</em><br />There response:<br />
<blockquote> Exactly—money does not follow the person in the House bill.  The Senate Finance bill does attempt to have the money the money follow the person I believe, but that gets complicated and provides a potential incentive for employers to try and push employees into the Exchange, which is expressly discouraged in HR 3269.  </p></blockquote>

<p>Third quarter nonfarm productivity rose at a 9.5% annual rate as output rose 4.0% and hours worked fell at a 5.0% rate.  Historically, productivity has been a very good leading indicator of real GDP growth lagged two quarters.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvLv9AWXR-I/AAAAAAAAA8U/cQqV9JlW0yE/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvLv9AWXR-I/AAAAAAAAA8U/cQqV9JlW0yE/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Productivity is also highly cyclical and the first year of a recovery typically experiences the strongest productivity growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvLuoNF_yuI/AAAAAAAAA8E/0daJUAfPQ-U/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvLuoNF_yuI/AAAAAAAAA8E/0daJUAfPQ-U/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Compensation jumped to a 3.8% annual rate, but on a year over year basis it is only up 0.5%.<br />Consequently, the year over year change in unit labor cost was -5.2%, the largest drop in recent years.  With productivity growth this strong and such weak compensation growth it is hard to see how anyone can be seriously concerned about a resurgence of inflation.  Except for oil, even surging commodity prices would not have a significant impact on the overall price level since they account for such a small share of final prices.  Moreover, since potential GDP is a function of productivity growth and labor force growth the argument that the very large GDP gap is overstated does not seem to hold much weight as long as productivity growth is so strong.</p>

<p>Last evening the <a target="_blanks" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=414">CBO Director Blog</a> announced the release of a score of the Boehner amendment: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/107xx/doc10705/hr3962amendmentBoehner.pdf">A Preliminary Analysis of a Substitute Amendment to H.R. 3962, the Affordable Health Care for America Act</a>. The results are not impressive: (as always click to enlarge)<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmiuzmBI/AAAAAAAAAVM/lr71klquZjg/s1600-h/Boehner-dollars.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmiuzmBI/AAAAAAAAAVM/lr71klquZjg/s400/Boehner-dollars.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmBBmA_I/AAAAAAAAAVE/08X3_2AgUss/s1600-h/Boehner-coverage.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SvLsmBBmA_I/AAAAAAAAAVE/08X3_2AgUss/s400/Boehner-coverage.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The amendment is scored at reducing the deficit by $68 billion over ten years. I can&#8217;t get the breakdown to add up (see page 4) but most of the savings is in the form of malpractice reform at $54 billion with further savings from some administrative changes relating to electronic transfers and adoption of the Eschoo Biologics Amendment all of which offsets a whopping $8 billion net actually spent to expand coverage. So what do we get from spending an average of just around $800 million a year? Essentially nothing, CBO projects that the percentage of the legal non-elderly population without health insurance will stay right at 83%.</p>
<p>I suggest the words &#8216;Epic fail&#8217; apply here.

<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nasi.org/usr_doc/Fixing_Social_Security.pdf">National Academy of Social Insurance</a> report on options for Social Security is public and now available in pdf form. &#8220;The purpose of this report is to help analysts and policymakers consider options to bring Social Security into long-term balance in ways that also address concerns about benefit adequacy.&#8221; </p>
<p>One cannot simply glance through such dense material and numbers, but I did find the following on page 14 (or actually page 20 of 44 pdf form). (the exact numbers have been changed from the proposal by NASI, but are faithful to the process):  </p>
<p>From page 14:<br />
<blockquote>Option #7c: Schedule a Very Gradual Contribution Rate Increase Over 20 Years. To avoid abrupt changes in Social Security contribution rates, this option would schedule very gradual increases in the Social Security contribution rate (one-twentieth of one percent per year over 20 years for employees and employers, each), beginning in 2015. By 2035, the Social Security rate would be 7.2 percent for both workers and employers. In 2015, the increase for an average earner making $53,085 then would be $26.50 a year, or about 50 cents a week. It would reduce the 75-year deficit by 1.39 percent of taxable payroll or by about 69 percent. Dale Coberly, a frequent commenter on Social Security, recommended a gradual tax increase of this sort (Coberly, Larson and Webb 2009).11</p></blockquote>
<p>Footnote also on page 14 of the NASI report:<br />
<blockquote>11 Dale Coberly is a student of Social Security policy and frequent commenter on Social Security via the blog Angry Bear. Angry Bear was named one of the top 25 independent economic blogs on the Internet by the Wall Street Journal and TimeCNN. Coberly, Arne Larson and Bruce Webb collaborated on a modified version of this option in their Northwest Plan. For details of the Northwest Plan, see “The Angry Bear Social Security Series” at http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/08/angry-bear-social-security-series.html.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like many contributors not in the spotlight the hours devoted to creating material to even be noticed, then evaluated, and then published is a testimony to hard work, due diligence, and a non-profit motive. The weekend hours and midnight oil burned by NASI personnel and contributors is rarely noticed by media, nor appreciated by recipients.  Many of us talk about &#8216;they&#8217;&#8230;.well, meet three.  Best to Bruce, Dale, and Arne.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/11/curious-meeting-at-treasury-department.html">Yves Smith</a> describes a meeting she attended at Treasury in D.C. Read at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/11/curious-meeting-at-treasury-department.html">her place</a> or the rest under the fold.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Treasury invited a small group of bloggers for a “discussion” with senior officials on Monday. Initially, the meeting was to be background, which is a sort of journalistic “FYI but you can’t use it” but we were told at the meeting that we could discuss the meeting as long as remarks were not attributed to particular individuals. </p>
<p>None of us knew in advance how many attendees there would be; there were eight of us at a two-hour session, Interfluidity, Marginal Revolution, Kid Dynamite’s World, Across the Curve, Financial Armageddon, Accrued Interest, and Aleph (and of course, others may have been invited who had scheduling conflicts). There was a place card for Megan McArdle as well. </p>
<p>I was surprised that the powers that be would bother with financial bloggers, and I wondered at the decision rule behind the selection (besides wanting a mix, particularly from a political standpoint). This was also not an anonymous briefing of the sort that has come under criticism (but the anonymity request is still peculiar; is this a Team Obama fixation?) Given that the efforts have Administration has been made efforts to bring critics from the left into the fold, I was wary of attending (I’m not keen about the idea of being propagandized) and expected a higher control format (10-15 people, which would have limited the opportunity to interact). </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>It wasn’t obvious what the objective of the meeting was (aside the obvious idea that if they were nice to us we might reciprocate. Unfortunately, some of us are not housebroken). I will give them credit for having the session be almost entirely a Q&#038;A, not much in the way of presentation. One official made some remarks about the state of financial institutions; later another said a few things about regulatory reform. The funniest moment was when, right after the spiel on regulatory reform, Steve Waldman said, “I’ve read your bill and I think it’s terrible.” They did offer to go over it with him. It will be interesting to see if that happens.</p>
<p>Four of us had a drink afterward and none of us felt that we learned anything (not that we expected to per se; if the ground rules are “not for attribution” in an official setting, we are certainly not going to be told anything new or juicy). But my feeling, and it seemed to be shared, was that we bloggers and the government officials kept talking past each other, in that one of us would ask a question, the reply would leave the questioner or someone in the audience unsatisfied, there might be a follow up question (either same person or someone interested), get another responsive-sounding but not really answer, and then another person would get the floor. The fact that the social convention of no individual hogging air time meant that no one could follow a particular line of inquiry very far.</p>
<p>My bottom line is that the people we met are very cognitively captured, assuming one can take their remarks at face value. Although they kept stressing all the things that had changed or they were planning to change, the polite pushback from pretty all the attendees was that what Treasury thought of as major progress was insufficient. It was instructive to observe that Tyler Cowen, who is on the other side of the ideological page from yours truly, had pretty much the same concerns as your humble blogger does.</p>
<p>It was also striking to see that the Treasury officials lacked a vision for a banking system for the 21st century that was materially different that the one we have now. The flip side is if they did, articulating that publicly might get them accused of doing Communist central planning, but I didn’t hear second level arguments that said they had considered the issue in a serious way, save not winding the clock back to much more on balance sheet intermediation, aka traditional banking, as opposed to “market based credit”. Nevertheless, at a McKinsey alumni meeting months ago, a partner who has been advising the Treasury and Fed told the group that the Administration wants to make being systemically important very costly to force firms to do what is necessary to get out of that category. That of course is structural reform, but we got no acknowledgment of that as an aim. And aside from raising capital requirements more for big firms than smaller ones, it is not clear how far Treasury could go down that path on its own (and strictly regulatory measures can be rolled back by a new Adminisitration).</p>
<p>Several of us raised questions about whether what their vision for the industry’s structure was and that the objective seemed to be to restore the financial system that got us in trouble in the first place. The answers instead focused on more stringent regulations, higher capital levels, and of course the derivatives regulation bill. I tried twice to engage them on how the bill has so many loopholes that it is not going to make any difference as far as the real problem is concerned (the out for customized derivatives, in the Administration proposal, gave the industry an easy and obvious way to evade the rules; the House pretty much gutted what was left) but I was not specific enough in saying what “loophole” constituted and was basically deflected (and was also told the derivatives on balance sheet would be subject to tougher capital requirements, and the industry was complaining that the bill would make things more costly for them. Ahem, it has become standard practice of all the powerful lobbies to make a great deal of noise about any change on principle, so the level of complaining is not a valid indicator of the efficacy of reform). </p>
<p>I also asked about the size of the financial services industry (as in one of the distortions that resulted from deregulation and rates being too low was that the financial sector had grown too large, which by implication means it needed to shrink. I was told it had shrunk and that the Fed was winding down its programs. Yes, but the expectation is that as the Fed winds down, the private markets will step into be breach, which means more credit private credit extension. There was no acknowledgment of the issue raised by Joseph Stiglitz, that if credit intermediaries are making too much money, the banking system tail is wagging the economic dog. </p>
<p>They also defended the stress tests as being serious, and again did not seem to win converts.</p>
<p>One area that we didn’t get into was the special resolution regime, which is receiving considerable pushback from Congress. Treasury has asked for open-ended authority to resolve large financial institutions, which is pretty much a blank check. That’s a breathtaking power grab by the Executive and should not be acceptable in a democracy. It wasn’t surprising that post the TARP that Congress would be completely unwilling to go there. Any decision to wind up a large bank is going to require Congressional authorization; the amounts at stake are too large for this not to be a political decision. The Resolution Trust Corporation working capital needs ($50 billion, if I recall correctly) were authorized by Congress, and Congress also became impatient and called for it to be wrapped up sooner than Treasury wanted (some studies have argued that the faster sales that resulted gave the taxpayer a lower return than the RTC would have gotten otherwise). And even if you could solve the political impasse (remember, Bear failed in ten days; think Congress could agree to a big backstop in that short a period of time?) I am not certain this change will be salutary in the absence of trading counterparties knowing exactly what would happen to them while an organization was being wound down. One of the things that makes securities firms decay quickly is that no one wants to have their accounts frozen, as happens now in a bankruptcy. You need considerable detail on mechanics, and it does not appear to have been disclosed yet (my buddies at the Roosevelt Institute conference on Monday said Rodgin Cohen, who was presenting and advocating the Administration plans, was also scarce on details).</p>
<p>But the other fact is that these guys are very smooth, very smart, and seemed quite sincere, which made it difficult to discern how much they really did believe and how much of what they said they had to say because they need to defend official policy and maintain confidence. Let’s face it, they get prodded and roughed up by big dogs with some frequency. There was nothing we asked that would be new. They’ve covered this ground with other people of more consequence and therefore have answers ready. We are a pretty unimportant audience (yes, they did bother making time for us, but let us not kid ourselves on how far down the food chain bloggers are) and we cannot argue from a position of advantaged information, so it was inevitable that we would not get beyond standard responses. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Linda Beale</p>
<p>Part of the reason for our ongoing Great Recession is that we have had so many measures in the tax code to favor home ownership that (i) banks started to think of mortgage securitization business as money growing on trees and (ii) homeowners started to think of their homes as money-growing trees.  The bubble burst when the whole house of cards almost came tumbling down&#8211;it was revealed that banks had lent money through sub-prime mortgages to people who couldn&#8217;t afford to make the payments, that people were hoodwinked into getting subprime mortgages (at higher costs) that could have afforded a regular mortgage, that house prices could not just keeping climbing. </p>
<p>Nobody liked the way the &#8220;market correction&#8221; worked&#8211;foreclosures, evictions, job losses and home losses heaped on top of each other.  Made especially bad when banks foreclosed on individuals for falling short on payments, refused to accept &#8220;short sales&#8221;, and then ended up letting the houses deteriorate and selling them for much less in foreclosure sales.  Made worse when we watched the bailout drama unfold, with investment banks and companies like AIG (investment banks&#8217; friendly insurer and credit default contract counterparty) saved with trillions of dollars of federal tax money on the line, while home foreclosures for ordinary people continued.</p>
<p>Congress couldn&#8217;t get the will to pass a bill to permit modification of home loans in bankruptcy&#8211;the one bill that would have done the most to save current homeowners from losing their homes and the social/economic disruption such a loss causes.</p>
<p>But somehow it managed, as part of the economic stimulus bill, to pass a tax cuts to encourage people to buy homes who hadn&#8217;t owned one before.  I thought that bill was problematic from the beginning.  First, it was not an ineffective stimulus, in that it was not as effective as, and much more costly than, permitting mortgage loans to be modified (i.e., principal to be reduced) in bankruptcy.  Second, it was not fair&#8211;those who&#8217;d bought homes earlier and were now struggling with underwater mortgages got no help, but someone who managed to put together a deal made possible by the many foreclosed properties would also get a boost from tax funding. </p>
<p>At least, I thought, it&#8217;s temporary&#8211;so we won&#8217;t be saddled with another one of those monster tax expenditures that gets built into the Code and pricing expectations and is well nigh impossible to repeal, like the home mortgage interest deduction and the home gain exclusion provisions that permanently distort investment decisions in favor of housing over many other valuable capital expenditures&#8211;such as college and post-graduate education.</p>
<p>Well, it looks like that was wrong.  Congress is close to enacting an extension and expansion, trying to save the crisis caused in part by the housing bubble by creating incentives to invest in more housing.  Today (Nov. 2), the Senate voted 85-2 to invoke cloture on H.R. 3548, the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Act.  It will extend the deadline for the $8000 credit through the end of April 2010.  But it will also provide a new credit to existing homeowners to help them buy a different house.  See BNA Daily Tax RealTime (nov. 2, 2009 at 7:20pm).   Presumably that&#8217;s aimed at those who&#8217;ve relocated and have to sell and maybe have rented for a few years but are still unable to sell for full price.  See <a href="http://www.beachcondos.com/blog/8000-tax-credit-new-deal/">this blog </a>for more info, which also notes that the expansion will also raise income limits to $225,000 for married couples. </p>
<p>Egads!  I can see why real estate professionals and people who will get the windfall would support this.  But it is hard to believe that it makes sense to provide more tax breaks for housing, especially when it is only to a select group that just happens to be in a position to purchase this year, who are already likely to get pretty darned good deals anyway, and especially if it includes well-off couples who make almost a quarter million annually (the current credit phases out starting at $150,000 for couples)?   Especially when this extension alone will cost us another $17 billion or so.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re also extending and expanding the provision allowing carrybacks of business losses.  Before, it was just open to small businesses.  Now, there will be an NOL carryback for five years for all businesses, so long as they had losses in either 2008 or 2009.  </p>
<p>The only good thing in this bill, as far as I can see, is the provision for extension of unemployment benefits.</p>
