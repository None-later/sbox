<p>For the sake of argument, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/feature/2009/11/02/healthcare_employment/index.html">jobs in our future</a> over the next few years or so appear to be in the health care industry and education.  Jobs needing less education than a BA are among the fastest growing. <br />
<blockquote>Where are tomorrow&#8217;s jobs going to come from? The question is more urgent than ever, with official unemployment hovering around 10 percent and with nearly one in five Americans unemployed, if you count part-time workers who want full-time jobs and people so desperate that they have given up looking for work entirely.</p>
<p>Most popular discussion about jobs focuses on the effects of offshoring of manufacturing jobs to China and other countries, many of which, like China, manipulate exchange rates and use subsidies to promote their industries. Combating predatory trade practices and rebalancing global trade by means of higher U.S. exports is important, in the short and medium term. But in the long run technologically driven productivity growth is the most important factor in shaping employment in the U.S. and every country in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Productivity and innovation are the catch words, and examples demonstrate how this has worked in the last century. But if policy makers need to craft a response to mitigate the changes, and re-training happens, what is it going to be?  <br />
<blockquote>The emptying of the cubicles won&#8217;t result in permanent mass unemployment, the present prolonged crisis notwithstanding. As it has always done in the past, labor will shift from more mechanized to less mechanized sectors. But what will those jobs be?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The aging of the boomers accounts for only 10 percent of the growth. The rest comes from increasing demand. That&#8217;s because productivity growth in agriculture, construction and manufacturing has greatly reduced the cost of food, shelter and appliances. In the U.S. and similar nations, the freed-up income tends to be used on quality-of-life goods, of which healthcare is the most important.</p>
<p>&#8230;the economist Robert Fogel, &#8220;Just as electricity and manufacturing were the industries that stimulated the growth of the rest of the economy at the beginning of the 20th century, healthcare is the growth industry of the 21st century. It is a leading sector, which means that expenditures on healthcare will pull forward a wide array of other industries, including manufacturing, education, financial services, communications and construction.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Another widespread myth holds that most Americans need to go to college in the future. In reality, most of the fastest-growing jobs, including those in healthcare, do not require a four-year bachelor&#8217;s degree. According to the Council of Economic Advisers: &#8220;The categories with some education required beyond high school are growing faster than those not requiring post-secondary schooling.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>None of this means that we don&#8217;t need world-class scientists and engineers, or that we don&#8217;t need to rebuild our manufacturing export industries, or that we don&#8217;t need to hire people to design and build up-to-date infrastructure and energy systems. High-tech agriculture, manufacturing and infrastructure and related business and professional services will remain essential to economic dynamism. But thanks to ever smarter machines, fewer and fewer people will work in the primary (field), secondary (factory) and tertiary (office) sectors. Most of the job growth will be in the &#8220;quaternary&#8221; sector of healthcare and other qualify-of-life services.</p></blockquote>

<p>Larry Summers, who is very very good at provoking debate,  said <br />“It may be desirable to have a given amount of work shared among more people. But that’s not as desirable as expanding the total amount of work.” </p>
<p>Paul Krugman responds <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/13/opinion/13krugman.html">here</a>  </p>
<p>True. But we are not, in fact, expanding the total amount of work — and Congress doesn’t seem willing to spend enough on stimulus to change that unfortunate fact. So shouldn’t we be considering other measures, if only as a stopgap?”  </p>
<p>Please click the link and read Krugman&#8217;s op-ed if you haven&#8217;t already.  It is excellent but limited to 700 words.  Unlimited reflections on the topic after the jump.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to start with my proposal.  I think that there should be a combination of subsidies for new hires funded by revenues from cap and trade (I&#8217;m a member of the Pigou club) and an increase in the progressivity of the tax system (not just because I always want to increase the progressivity of the tax system).  </p>
<p>Second, Krugman suggests that US unemployment is not just high, but much higher than it need be given the large recession and small stimulus.  Note that the evidence he presents is the change in employment and unemployment in the US and Germany.  One might suspect that this amounts to the US unemployment rate rising to a level similar to the German unemployment rate – that in effect Krugman is proposing that we don&#8217;t accept unemployment that suddenly rises to around 10% in a recession but rather insist on such levels all the time.</p>
<p>One would be wrong (I admit I was such a one, I haven&#8217;t been following German unemployment).  The OECD standardized US unemployment rate <a target="_blank" href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/12/6/43860143.pdf">surpassed the Euro area unemployment rate in August 2009</a> (warning pdf)  (figures for September are in the mail the August figures were released October 12).  The OECD standardized US unemployment rate 9.7% was significantly higher than the German rate 7.7% in August.  The decline in German GDP was, if anything, slightly larger.  I find this stunning.</p>
<p>So how did they do it and should we do what they did?  </p>
<p>First all Euro area countries have strong restrictions on layoffs.  At least two Italy and Spain have decided not to apply the restrictions to many newly hired workers starting, in the case of Spain, almost 30 years ago.  The Spanish increase in unemployment is even huger than the US increase.</p>
<p>It was already clear in 1980  that employment protection protected employment in recessions.  It is also notable that, before their reforms relaxing restrictions, Italy and Spain managed decades with no employment growth.  I very much like employment protection legislation as it changes the balance of power between workers and employers.   I don&#8217;t like zero employment growth for decades.  In any case, it isn&#8217;t going to happen there (in the USA).  </p>
<p>The effect of employment protection legislation is a confounding factor not relevant to the US policy debate and  a major part of the explanation of the especially bad experiences of the US, Spain and Ireland.  </p>
<p>Second job sharing.  Germans have been doing this for decades.  The idea is that there is a fixed number of hours of work demanded and it is better if everyone works part time than if some are unemployed.  This reasoning is like a red flag to a bull to almost all economists certainly including Larry Summers (and including Paul Krugman in the past).  Krugman considers it a third best approach imposed by political limitations.  I&#8217;d note that the simplest way to do this would be to make the payroll tax progressive so that less has to be paid by firms and workers if there are  more workers each of whom is paid less .  Also a progressive payroll tax implies increased revenues in the future even if marginal rates are a function of real wages (so inflation doesn&#8217;t cause bracket creep). </p>
<p>In one of my favorite papers of all time <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1803472">MacDonald and Solow </a>argue that employment will be increased by a progressive payroll tax for fixed revenues (zero in their model).  They consider a unionized firm (the paper is very old) but evidence on wages suggests that similar things happen without formal unions.  The point is that it doesn&#8217;t really matter why a firm is spending the same money to pay 3 people a lot or 4 people a little.  Whether the 3 are paid a lot because they work longer hours or because they have higher hourly wages, hiring them is still 3 jobs for the price of 4.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see any value added from applying the benefit only in cases in which one can document the splitting of a set of tasks to share jobs.  This would be complicated and I don&#8217;t think there is anything especially desirable about that.</p>
<p>Note a historical example, the Clinton tax increase of 1993.  Not all taxes were increased as the bill also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit.  Taxes were higher on average and much more progressive.  The tax changes were followed  not only by a huge increase in employment but also a downward shift of the Phillips curve.  Theory and evidence correspond in this case.  Also the proposal is wildly popular according to dozens of polls.</p>
<p>OK aside from that Krugman mentions hiring subsidies.  Now most such subsidies would go to employers who would have hired without a subsidy.  One would expect much of that money to go to the workers who would have been hired anyway (how much depends on assumptions about labor markets and/or bargaining).  So ?  It&#8217;s an excuse to pump more money into the economy which would be good policy.  </p>
<p>Also such subsidies have been <a target="_blank" href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119465893/abstract?CRETRY&#038;CRETRY=1&#038;SRETRY=0">shown to affect employment</a>.  In particular a deadline to get the subsidy (only paid if one hires before oh say November 2 2010 just to pick a date) would have a large effect on the speed of the increase in employment.    Following Greg Mankiw, I&#8217;d add it on to cap and trade as part of where the revenues go.    As noted by Mankiw, this is also an excuse to start subsidizing before CO2 permits are actually sold as it takes time to set up a cap and trade system.</p>
<p>So I propose the Greg Mankiw/soak the rich plan to help US employment.</p>

<p>Apropos Angry Bear exploration of &#8220;structural unemployment&#8221;, Mark writes on the topic of unemployment:</p>
<blockquote><p>The types of unemployment</p>
<p>Economists define three types of unemployment: frictional, structural, and cyclical. Frictional unemployment is defined as the unemployment that occurs because of people moving or changing occupations. Demographic change can also play a role in this type of unemployment since young or first-time workers tend to have higher-than-normal turnover rates as they settle into a long-term occupation. An important distinguishing feature of this type of unemployment, unlike the two that follow it, is that it is voluntary on the part of the worker.</p>
<p>Structural unemployment is defined as unemployment arising from technical change such as automation, or from changes in the composition of output due to variations in the types of products people demand. For example, a decline in the demand for typewriters would lead to structurally unemployed workers in the typewriter industry.</p>
<p>Cyclical unemployment is defined as workers losing their jobs due to business cycle fluctuations in output, i.e. the normal up and down movements in the economy as it cycles through booms and recessions over time.</p>
<p>What is normal unemployment?</p>
<p>Cyclical unemployment is the main worry of policymakers such as the Fed, and they attempt to minimize this type of unemployment through policy changes such as lowering interest rates in recessions. We are currently seeing this in action. Frictional and structural unemployment are considered normal and necessary. When these are the only two types of unemployment that exist, i.e. when cyclical unemployment has been eliminated, the economy is considered to be at full employment.</p>
<p>Why are frictional and structural unemployment considered normal and necessary? Frictional unemployment promotes efficient matching of workers and jobs. It allows workers to leave jobs they don’t like or aren’t good at and then find new jobs to which they are better suited. If there were never any vacancies, finding a better matching job would be much more difficult if not impossible. It would require trading jobs with someone who has the job you want and wants the job you have (and both employers would have to agree to make the hires). This means that some degree of frictional unemployment is desirable.</p>
<p>Structural unemployment allows the economy to implement new technology such as robots on assembly lines, and to respond to changes in demand for various products. If we didn’t allow this type of technological change, we’d be using outdated production methods and always be consuming exactly the same mix of goods at every point in time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once defined, and probably needing several posts as AB is finding, is the call for retraining, workers moving to where the jobs are, and incentives for US firms to locate in areas of the US needing development.</p>
<blockquote><p>The change in the structural component could, however, be significant. I expect structural unemployment to be higher than it was, particularly in the next few years. We had too many resources in housing, finance, and automobile production, and it will take time for the economy to make the necessary structural adjustments. When this is combined with continuing globalization, as well as the higher savings rate and correspondingly lower consumption expected from households in the future, both of which cause structural change within the economy, the expectation is that the new target rate of unemployment will rise above the 4 percent level it was at before the recession.</p>
<p>Exactly how much it will rise and for how long is hard to say. A 5 or 6 percent rate, or even somewhat higher is certainly imaginable, but getting it right is important. If policymakers target an unemployment rate that is too low, they risk causing inflation (one reason for the high rate of inflation in the 1970s is that the Fed targeted a 4 percent unemployment rate when the actual rate of normal unemployment was much higher due to structural and demographic change). If they target a rate that is too high, then they risk having people be unnecessarily unemployed in the economy.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean we are completely powerless. There are ways to help with structural unemployment, though the tools for doing so aren’t as powerful as we’d like. In essence, structural unemployment arises from a mismatch between the supply of jobs in various industries and geographical locations, and the workers available to meet those needs. Thus, job training that promotes a better match of worker skills with available jobs, programs that help workers move to places where jobs exist, and programs to induce firms to locate where there is an oversupply of workers, e.g. Detroit, can mitigate some of the impact. Extended unemployment compensation can also cushion the blow for workers during the adjustment period. But the history of these programs indicates that we shouldn’t expect miracles for workers, and some degree of higher unemployment will need to be tolerated while the economy undergoes the necessary structural adjustments.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>As I am arguing <a target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703574604574501632123501814.html">on the same side as Henry Kaufman</a>, and against the <a target="_blank" href="http://moneywatch.bnet.com/economic-news/blog/maximum-utility/the-importance-of-fed-independence/151/">kind-hearted Mark Thoma</a>, does the phrase &#8220;left-of-center&#8221; at the top of this blog have as much Memory Meaning as the Suzanne Vega song from <em><a target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0091790/">Pretty in Pink</a></em>?</p>
<p>Kaufman:<br />
<blockquote>During the Greenspan years (1987-2006), the Fed clearly failed to recognize the significance of the many structural changes in the financial markets—such as the rapid growth of securitization and derivatives—on economic and financial behavior and thus for its monetary policy. The Fed also failed to foresee how the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which had separated commercial from investment banking since 1933, would sharply accelerate financial concentration through mergers and acquisitions and thus contribute to the &#8220;too-big-to-fail&#8221; phenomenon.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thoma:<br />
<blockquote>The hope is that an independent Fed can overcome the temptation to use monetary policy to influence elections, and also overcome the temptation to monetize the debt, and that it will do what’s best for the economy in the long-run rather than adopting the policy that maximizes the chances of politicians being reelected.</p></blockquote>
<p>On of those people lives in reality.  The other, apparently, is a good econometrician.

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c111:2:./temp/~c1113ofzd6::">H.R.3962:<br />Affordable Health Care for America Act (Engrossed as Agreed to or Passed by House)</a>.</p>
<p>Back in July I singled out what I thought was the single most important provision of the House Tri-Committee Bill in a post called <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/07/hr3200-sec-116-golden-bullet-or-smoking.html">Sec 116: Golden Bullet or Smoking Gun</a>. Yesterday I followed up with a new post here called <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/11/still-most-important-sentence-in-house.html">STILL the Most Important Sentence in the House HR Bill</a> which cited the ALMOST identical language between Sec 116 of the Tri-Committee Bill and Sec 102 of the bill as brought to the floor and posted similar material in diaries at dKos, MyDD, and Open Left. Only to find out from  commenter Gerald Weinand, who actually read the bill with close attention to detail, that there were significant changes in wording that drastically changed the impact of this language by shifting it forward in time and then sunsetting it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what to make of this change, but it is the subject of a LONG piece at the BruceWeb <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/11/read-bill-part-3-and-possible-reading.html">Read the Bill Part 3; and a possible reading error</a>. In any event going forward I think it is vital that everyone be reading off the same page. The above link to the bill as passed may not be stable, if not you can search it pretty easily from the Thomas.gov site or use the pdf version published by the GPO:  http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&#038;docid=f:h3962eh.txt.pdf<br />(Update: MG supplies a better Thomas link: http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:h.r.03962 Thanx)</p>
<p>My personal belief and a hope is that a mistake has been made and that this provision was not meant to sunset when the Exchange starts operation, and that a fix will be made, it would be a true shame if the best regulatory control of insurance company profits just ended up on the cutting floor, either deliberately or by accident.</p>

<p>More on the Estate Tax&#8211;the Heritage Foundation speaks gobbledygook<br />hat tip to Tax Prof and its commenters</p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve concluded, is not a &#8220;think tank&#8221; at all&#8211;it&#8217;s a propaganda tank.  And the propaganda it spews tends to be in support of ideas that may sound sort of okay if you don&#8217;t probe them very deeply but are apparently intended to further the benefits of society for the elites who already enjoy most of the benefits of society.</p>
<p>Look at their most recent take on the estate tax.  Beach, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/wm2688.cfm">Seven Reasons Why Congress Should Repeal, Not Fix, the [Estate] Tax (Nov. 9, 2009)</a>.  (Yes, I &#8220;corrected&#8221; the title&#8211;after all, the use of &#8220;death tax&#8221; is an attempt to use emotions about death to move people to hold particular positions about the tax.  And there&#8217;s no such thing as a tax on death&#8211;death is not taxable income.  What is taxed is the estate left by the decedent to heirs or beneficiaries who did nothing to earn it.  So estate tax is the correct name, and death tax is a manipulative play on words.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve argued here, of course, that the current fiscal crisis (brought on by many of those people, by the way, whose estates will likely be big enough to be subject to the estate tax if we are not so foolhardy as to repeal it before they die) calls for rethinking the &#8220;tax cuts are always good&#8221; mentality that was set in motion with Ronald Reagan&#8217;s &#8220;privatization, deregulation, militarization, and tax cut&#8221; dogma.  We do need to rebalance our budget once we are through this crisis, and a good place to begin is by getting rid of tax loopholes that don&#8217;t make sense and retaining or even increasing taxes that make a lot of sense.  The estate tax is a tax that makes a lot of sense and should probably be increased, not eliminated.</p>
<p>(ASIDE:  Reagan is often treated as though he was a great philosopher.  What he was was a master of sound bites and a person with rigid views that were self-contradictory.  You can&#8217;t increase military spending, privatize government function at great costs to the government, and cut taxes to pay for those new subsidies for private business and the military-industrial lobby without running up huge deficits.  So he had a big tax cut, and then tried to make up for it with a bunch of tax increases.)</p>
<p>So how does the Heritage Foundation seek to justify its proposal for repeal of the estate tax?  It provides seven arguments:</p>
<p>1) <i>the estate tax discourages savings and investments</i></p>
<p>True, to some extent, but probably much less so than proponents of repeal would have us believe.  Any tax discourages what is taxed, so labor taxes discourage labor and taxes on capital income discourage savings.  But much less so in the case of the estate tax (compared to a tax on wealth as it is accumulated).  The estate tax doesn&#8217;t have much effect on living accumulators, because their goal is to accumulate ever more&#8211;if anything, the estate tax may encourage saving so that they will have &#8220;enough&#8221; to leave.  So while the Heritage Foundation says that the estate tax sends a signal in favor of consumption, the fact is that estates are continuing to grow at phenomenol rates. IN fact, we might well want to encourage the wealthy to consume more and even say that this might be a very positive incentive effect of the estate tax, if only it were true.  Wealthy consumption would reduce the size of the estate and limit the windfall power of plutocracies.</p>
<p>Of course, the estate tax doesn&#8217;t have any effect once the one who gathered the estate dies&#8211;the decedent can no longer be incentivized to save or not.  The estate tax doesn&#8217;t have any incentive effect on the people who acquire the estate (heirs, beneficiaries) since they are getting a pure windfall, whatever they receive.</p>
<p>2. <i>The estate tax undermines job creation.<br /></i><br />The Heritage foundation is claiming that the tax money is kept out of the investment stream and therefore undermines job creation.  This is just a restatement of the same argument in item one.</p>
<p>Again, no empirical evidence here, of course.  Right-wing economists consistently claim that the wealth in estates would be the source of powerful job creation entrepreneurialism if only we would leave that tax money as well to heirs, so they could invest to create jobs, but there&#8217;s no evidence to support that claim.  Entreprenuerialism doesn&#8217;t ordinarily come from wealthy heirs to estates sitting in their effortlessly acquired empires.  In fact, again, it is more likely that dispersal of big estates would do more for job creation than letting heirs continue to horde the wealth set aside by their benefactors in hidden overseas bank accounts or invested in emerging markets or in other ways passively collecting income as most capital assets do.  Even if letting heirs receive that tax money to invest rather than giving it to the federal government might create a few jobs, it is equally true that government spending with the same money creates jobs and perhaps does it better.  Heritage&#8217;s argument here just amounts to the same old saw that government is less efficient at using money than the private sector is.  And again, this is simply not an established fact.  In fact, we have evidence to the contrary in many instances&#8211;there are numerous examples that privatization is less efficient/more costly at getting the same job done.  Take subsidized student loans compared to direct student loans without banks as intermediaries.  The first costs the government money (to subsidize the banks) while the latter makes money for the government.  Take Blackwater (now Xe Company).  It&#8217;s employees are paid 2 to 6 times what soldiers are paid for doing the same job.  Not more efficient, and in fact more costly. and fewer jobs because each job is paid so much.  There are numerous examples that privatization is less efficient at getting the job done and that government may in some, maybe many, instances be better at job creation than rich guys hording wealth or buttressing up under-utilized family ranch empires.</p>
<p>3.  <i>Estate taxes suppress productivity and wage growth</i></p>
<p>This is just another version of two which was another version of one, since what the Heritage Foundation says is that productivity and wage growth are suppressed because there is less investment that keeps businesses from buying tools and equipment that keeps them from hiring new employees.   As noted, maybe some investment isn&#8217;t made that would have been made, but also government spending takes place that wouldn&#8217;t have taken place.  Hard to be sure where the tradeoff is in terms of productivity and wage growth.  To the extent that the estate tax repeal amount would be horded in unproductive, locked in investments, releasing it to the government, which spends it back out into the main stream of the economy might well multiply the productivty much faster.  </p>
<p>4. <i>Estate taxes contradict the central promise of American life&#8211;wealth creation.<br /></i><br />Folderol.  The central promise of American life is not plutocracy&#8211;it is the promise that everyone has opportunity to live a decent life&#8211;to acquire life&#8217;s necessities and to live secure in their homes.  There is in fact a conflict between that true conception of the central promise of American life and the conception forwarded by the Heritage Foundation, because if the wealthy elite is able to continue consolidating their stranglehold over the wealth of this country without contributing to the common good through taxation (as the capital gains preference, nontaxation until realization, and repeal of estate tax would mean), we will end up with a have and have-not society, with the haves living in gated communities and the have-nots left to struggle in a very rigid and immobile class structure without opportunities for advancement.  </p>
<p>5. <i>Estate taxes hurt those who have tied their savings up in land</i></p>
<p>This is the same old canard that the estate tax causes the loss of family farms and ranches.  It&#8217;s simply not even true, as has been explained countless times (there are special provisions to provide an installment payment so that the limited taxes due can be paid out of the income).  </p>
<p>Then the Heritage Foundation seems to suggest we should pity those wealthy farmers and ranchers whose land value has increased astronomically so that their immensely grown wealth means they do have some tax to pay and  they might end up deciding to sell some small part to pay whatever taxes are due.  So?  just because they own it in the form of land, we are supposed to say&#8211;don&#8217;t ever pay any taxes, just continue to accumulate immense wealth, and pass it on to your heirs so that they can become a plutocracy?  I don&#8217;t think so.</p>
<p>6. <i>Estate taxes hurt African American business owners</i></p>
<p>The Heritage Foundation only talks about African Americans when it is attempting to co-opt a group and get them to support something against interest.  This is not about African Americans but about businessmen&#8211;an argument that people who have businesses ought to be able to pass them along without being taxed.</p>
<p>7.  <i>Estate taxes hurt women business owners</i></p>
<p>Again, this hasn&#8217;t got anything to do with women.  It&#8217;s about business owners, just like number 6.  A</p>
<p>nd there is no real showing, by the way, that the estate tax hurts small business owners.  The estates of small business owners are almost always below the exemption level.  The estate tax gets the Bill Gates (Microsoft) and Waltons (WalMart) type business owners. And they can clearly afford to pay some tax.  The Heritage Foundation in items 6 and 7 is simply trying to pull on heart strings.  In fact, there is no reason at all to let the Walton billions accumulate and consolidate power once Sam Walton is gone.  </p>
<p>This is pretty much a garbage piece.  Although Beach, the author, has a title with the terms &#8220;data analysis&#8221; in it, there is no data analysis in this opinion piece. There are three footnotes. One presents a very incomplete picture about the politics behind the Bush Congress&#8217;s ridiculous bill dealing with estate tax (gradual decrease in the amount of tax collected until 2010, when the tax would be repealed for one year, but then the tax would spring back into life as it was pre-2001 when all of the Bush Congress&#8217;s tax cuts died their natural planned death).  One is a quote to the author&#8217;s own work claiming that estate taxes &#8220;kill the economy&#8221; (hardly credible, since the economy actually has done much better in periods of history when it was much higher than it is now, and performed only weakly under the Bush tax cuts).  One is work by Holtz-Eaken and Cameron Smith where they &#8220;present an argument&#8221; that repealing the estate tax&#8211;ie &#8220;investing&#8221; (if it was invested) the taxes saved&#8211;would create 1.5 million jobs.  That&#8217;s a very weak piece itself.</p>
<p>For more comments, look at the commenters on tax prof.  I particularly like an anonymous posting, where he notes (again substituting the correct term and providing only part of his comment) that:</p>
<blockquote><p>1) lack of [estate] taxes encourages investment lock-in and inhibits efficient allocation of investments</p>
<p>2) lack of [estate] taxes inhibits job creation (see 1)</p>
<p>3) lack of [estate] taxes discourages the real central promise of American life&#8211;that hard work and smarts, and not being born lucky, are to be rewarded</p>
<p>4) lack of [estate] taxes discourages the 19th century view that wealth comes from holding huge tracts of under-utilized land&#8230;..</p></blockquote>
<p>And there&#8217;s Chet Hardy&#8217;s statement (an excerpt only here):</p>
<blockquote><p>Its just amazing that the same people who decry deficit spending (Sen. Jon Kyl) turn on a dime and advocate repealing the estate tax. That&#8217;s $20 billion per year folks. To put that in perspective, that&#8217;s enough to provide health care to every child who doesn&#8217;t have it. Its enough to build a new High Speed Rail line every single year.</p></blockquote>

<p>Much of the criticism about the House Health Care Bill coming from the left revolves around the &#8216;fact&#8217; that it has no meaningful premium and so profit controls. Moreover most of those same people are promoting HR676 as an alternative. Frankly those people simply haven&#8217;t read either bill with attention to detail. And this includes a lot of people sporting the title &#8216;Dr.&#8217;</p>
<p>In both cases the key language comes right up front. In HR3962 it is as follows:<br />
<blockquote>SEC. 102. ENSURING VALUE AND LOWER PREMIUMS. <br />(a) GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE.—Title XXVII of the Public Health Service Act is amended by inserting after section 2713 the following new section: <br />‘‘SEC. 2714. ENSURING VALUE AND LOWER PREMIUMS. <br />‘‘(a) IN GENERAL.—Each health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the small or large group market shall provide that for any plan year in which the coverage has a medical loss ratio below a level specified by the Secretary (but not less than 85 percent), the issuer shall provide in a manner specified by the Secretary for rebates to enrollees of the amount by which the issuer’s medical loss ratio is less than the level so specified. </p></blockquote>
<p>That final sentence simply guts the insurance companies current business which involves widening the spread between premium dollars collected and medical care actually provided. This sentence sets a hard limit on raising premiums while managing the risk pool to exclude those actually being likely to make claims. The tighter you manage your enrollment the harder it is to actually hit your mandated MLR, and every time you raise premiums you have to demonstrate that you have increased payouts to that same degree. Or else you have to rebate the difference.</p>
<p>In the original House Tri-Committee Bill this language was included in Sec. 116 and a site search on that term will pull up a series of posts on this dating back to July. And I have diaried on this elsewhere, yet somehow almost everyone has simply missed the significance of this. Or maybe I have overstated the case. If so explain it to me in comments. I will post a parallel post on the paragraphs that show HR676 to be a ridiculous piece of legislation, a case of a wolfish socialization program hidden in a Medicare for All sheep&#8217;s clothing, but for the moment I don&#8217;t want to distract from this key provision.</p>
