<p>Well, here is what I&#8217;m doing to support the US of A&#8217;s economy.  It&#8217;s a lesson in the real model of economics.  It is a scaled version of the concept of stimulus.  I  even did it by using financing just to make the model as close to real as possible.  (OK, I had to finance it but&#8230;I used my credit union.)  Yes, I&#8217;m driving up the debt, but  I&#8217;m creating jobs and  I&#8217;m build wealth.  </p>
<p>I purchased locally to assure my bank supplied money (debt) is multiplied as much as possible.  When this garage is done, I will have created over a dozen or more jobs directly and who knows how many as the debt money goes from the first exchange of hands (me to who ever) to the second exchange (whoever to whoever&#8217;s whoever).  Notice, that this is all happening via a producer economy not a financial economy.  Any rescuing of  banks is taking place by moving money into the hands of people first.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m even adapting to these hard economic times.  I&#8217;m looking else where to earn a living.  Actually, I&#8217;m looking to reduce my expenses by improving the effectiveness of my time.  The practice (yes, health care has taken a hit) and the flower shop are slow so I will be honing my mechanic skills and fixing my vehicles my self. <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SvYxGLNYdlI/AAAAAAAAAOg/Ty3Cfk8EPCM/s1600-h/Imported+Photos+00004.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SvYxGLNYdlI/AAAAAAAAAOg/Ty3Cfk8EPCM/s400/Imported+Photos+00004.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SvYxAEGX_SI/AAAAAAAAAOY/xE0xzvJ9Mg4/s1600-h/Imported+Photos+00001.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SvYxAEGX_SI/AAAAAAAAAOY/xE0xzvJ9Mg4/s400/Imported+Photos+00001.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Alas, there is a down side.

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://aguanomics.com/2009/11/political-economy-of-lobbying.html">David Zetland</a> at Aguanomics had some fun with a lecture and thought exercise.</p>
<blockquote><p>02 November 2009<br />The Political Economy of Lobbying </p>
<p>Last week, I taught my students about different auction techniques. After I auctioned four books under different rules, I auctioned $1.00 for $3.75.</p>
<p>Now before you say &#8220;WTF?&#8221; (or perhaps I am too late!), let me explain.</p>
<p>First, it was an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-pay_auction">all-pay auction</a>, which requires that all bidders pay their highest bid to the auctioneer, even if they do not &#8220;win.&#8221;</p>
<p>Second, watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN_kt97w7Wg">this video</a> of the auction (4 minutes! drama! laughter!): (rdan&#8230;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN_kt97w7Wg">use this link</a>)</p>
<p>Third, what happened? There were four bidders. Mr. A bid $0.25; Ms. B bid $0.50; Ms. C bid $0.75; Mr. D bid $1.00. Then Ms. B raised her bid to $1.25 before Mr. D won the auction with a $1.50 bid. Mr. D got $1.00, and I got $3.75 ($2.75 net). </p>
<p>Nice money maker, that all-in-auction :), which is why you should see five, below.</p>
<p>Fourth, why did this happen? Consider this:</p>
<p>1.If you bid $0.25 for $1.00, you stand to make $0.75.<br />2.If someone raises you (to $0.50), you lose that $0.25.<br />3.If you bid $0.75, then you still make (net) $0.25.</p>
<p>This set of incentives (&#8220;on the margin&#8221;) makes it rational to keep raising the stakes given that you have bid because winning always has a higher payoff than losing. The &#8220;right strategy&#8221; is, of course to not bid at all. (As Joshua, the computer, says in Wargames: &#8220;Strange game. The only winning move is not to play.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Fifth, all-pay auctions reproduce the dynamics of political lobbying in which the politician is auctioning the wording to some law, and lobbyists from both (many?) sides are contributing money, perks and attention to get their version of the law. All of the lobbyists pay, but only the politician wins.</p>
<p>Oh, and we lose as well. A politician who represented &#8220;the People&#8221; would write a law that maximized the positive change in social welfare, regardless of lobbying.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Politicians benefit from lobbying; lobbyists compete to receive our money and rights; and citizens suffer. [I could soften this language to &#8220;some politicians&#8221; or &#8220;sometimes,&#8221; but I these are structural institutionalized flaws.]</p></blockquote>

<p>I am eager to learn from this blog again.  A problem with solar and wind generation of electricity is the sun isn&#8217;t always shining and the wind isn&#8217;t always blowing and it is costly to store energy.  I don&#8217;t see why energy can&#8217;t be stored using hydroelectric dams.  They store huge amounts of energy in lakes.  So what&#8217;s the problem.  More thoughts after the jump.</p>
<p>OK problem number one is that the hydroelectric plants are where they are not where we want electricity.  This means that a national power grid which doesn&#8217;t waste energy would be needed.  I think that means very high tension direct current.  </p>
<p>Such capacity would also be needed to use wind power much at all as the windy states are sparsely populated.  I assume the problem is solvable and that the cost is not prohibitive.</p>
<p>A second problem is that the peak capacity of hydroelectric power plants would have to be increased.  If they build up water during the day and release it at night, then they have to be able to convert the large flow to electricity.  Dynamos would have to be added in some way.  Now I Imagine that this can&#8217;t be all that costly.  I think of a huge siphon or a tunnel or a channel.  Am I demonstrating my ignorance of engineering.</p>

<p>DOLB and I now agree that employees can opt-out of employer paid coverage and enroll in the Public Option. The key to entry to the PO is to not be ENROLLED in an employer plan. Now clearly there are ways to decline or drop employer paid coverage today. For example if you are retired military and covered under Tri-Care you don&#8217;t need to accept coverage, or if you get married to someone with a family plan you can drop coverage, at worst you would have to wait until the annual Open Enrollment period. There is nothing in ether current law or this proposed legislation that binds you to the employer plan. On the other hand the system is set up as &#8216;opt-out&#8217; rather than &#8216;opt-in&#8217;, if you accept a job with employer coverage and for whatever reason (perhaps you are a Christian Scientist) refuse to sign up for a plan option the employer is authorized to auto-enroll you in the lowest cost plan. But you can, if you choose take positive steps to opt-out of such coverage. So why does CBO project that so few people will choose to opt-out of employer coverage and into the Public Option? Well you would have to ask them, generally CBO doesn&#8217;t discuss its specific methodology, but the answer seems to be that on their calculations such a choice would not be financially advantageous to the worker. This was explained in a response of a congressional staffer to DOLBs email question:<br />
<blockquote>Any individual (but not any employer) can participate in the Exchange and therefore could sign up for the public option. BUT, to do so, they would have to dis-enroll in their qualifying coverage and meet the other requirements necessary to participate in the Exchange. However, there is zero incentive for anyone to do this since they’d be responsible for 100% of the cost of the care they chose in the Exchange. If they stuck with their employer sponsored or other qualifying care, the vast majority of the cost of coverage is picked up by someone other than the individual. That’s why so few people are projected to enter into the public option. Additionally, access to the Exchange, and the public option, IS restricted for employers. Only the smallest businesses can use it at first, and later slightly larger businesses. The Secretary can then choose to open it up to all employers if she feels the Exchange has the capacity to handle that. The goal is to do so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Under Sec 411(3) Employers whose employees opt-out of coverage and enroll in an exchange plan, including the PO, have to pay a fee, but according to the congressional staffer the money does not explicitly follow the employee. So where does it go? What does it pay for? And there seems to be only one answer, one discussed below the fold.</p>
<p>The flat fee paid by employers for each opt-out employee goes into the general pot that funds individual affordability credits for Exchange Eligible employees which in this case includes the opt-outs. The rules governing affordability credits are laid out in Title III Subtitle C based on Income Determinations set out in Sec 345. Under the bill if you make more than 400% of Federal Poverty Level you are not eligible for affordability credits. Which means that any opt-out in this category would indeed be stuck with 100% of the cost of an Exchange Plan. But people earning between 150% and 400% of FPL would be eligible for affordability credits on a sliding scale. The question would be whether there are any circumstances under which the value of those credits exceed the value of the employer contribution to the employer plan. CBO seems to be calculating that in most cases the answer is no, the premium limits on those employer plans established in the bill being enough to maintain a rough parity between out of pocket costs between and individual plan under the Exchange and an employer group plan with enough advantage to the latter to keep employees from jumping ship. And maybe they have the balance right.</p>
<p>So when the staffer said that opt-out employees are stuck with 100% of the cost I think it was not quite right, if you are an Exchange Eligible Individual you are eligible for sustainability credits which reduce your cost. But per CBO not enough to actively induce large-scale opting out. Meaning that while everyone is theoretically ELIGIBLE for the Exchange, relatively few people will choose to ENROLL.</p>

                                <p>It took me many years to understand the phrase &#8220;moral hazard.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a fundamental tenet of economics, usually used to explain that, since consumers are untrustworthy, businesses need to charge them more.*</p>
<p>It was finally cleared up for me in the midst of a presentation last year about how it&#8217;s a &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; issue that divorce rates go up as more women work outside of the house/family business. So I asked the presenter, &#8220;You mean it&#8217;s a moral hazard issue that women who have an independent income can now get out of an abusive relationship?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, one of the best Labor Economists in the world was in the room.  He just looked up and said, &#8220;Or guys start leaving their wives because the wife can go to work now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aha!  The light dawns: moral hazard is, indeed, about power relationships: it allows arseholes to be even greater arseholes.  (One step further, and you start spouting Ayn Rand.)</p>
<p>Preceding is preamble to correcting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.philly.com/dailynews/local/20091104_Pension___seen_as_ticket_to_end_SEPTA_picket.html">an error made by a worker in today&#8217;s <em>Phialdelphia Daily News</em></a> (h/t Dr. Black, of course):<br />
<blockquote>Yesterday, Local 234 President Willie Brown said that the wage package was acceptable but that he was worried about the underfunded pension fund, funded only 52 percent. He said he believed that SEPTA had not contributed to it for 10 to 12 years&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could wake up and our pension could be completely gone,&#8221; [Brown] said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to end up like AIG,&#8221; referring to the international insurance giant who got $173 billion since last fall in a U.S. government bailout.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Brown should not worry about that.  AIG&#8217;s creditors (e.g., The Great Vampire Squid) were paid in full, because Tim Geithner and Larry Summers want a veto-proof Republican majority by 2012, if not 2010.**</p>
<p>Pensioners, otoh, are subject to &#8220;moral hazard.&#8221;  Believing their contracts were viable, reasonable, and negotiated by people who were working in the best interest of the firm—that is, people who were not writing a check with their mouth that their pockets couldn&#8217;t cash—clearly causes them not to do enough to save.  Because they don&#8217;t understand that mismanagement of their pension is <em>their fault</em>, and that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will only ensure that their pensions will be paid &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pbgc.gov/workers-retirees/auto-sector.html">up to certain limits</a>,&#8221; no matter how much extra Roger Smith or Michael Eisner or Jack Welch took from the company for <a target="_blank" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/jack-welch-and-the-lone-ranger-theory/?apage=2">performing almost as well as the rest of the stock market</a>.</p>
<p>So, let us say to Mr. Brown and the rest of the workers who depend on their pensions being funded: Don&#8217;t worry about being treated the way AIG was.  You&#8217;re going to be dealt with as a &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; problem for believing that the contract you negotiated will be enforced.</p>
<p>Why, if those workers were at all sensible, they would have taken the money upfront the way those Captains of Industry did, instead of gotten a false sense of security (&#8220;moral hazard&#8221;) from contractual negotiations about future payments.</p>
<p>As noted by Dr. Black, while management claims that they are fulfilling their legal obligations, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/20091106_How_the_pension_fund_figures_in_SEPTA_strike.html">management&#8217;s pension fund is almost 25% better funded than the workers fund</a> (53% v 65%).</p>
<p>This is, of course, A Good Thing.  After all, we wouldn&#8217;t want workers to believe that what they think of as Contractual Obligations is anything other than a case of &#8220;moral hazard.&#8221;</p>
<p>UPDATE: I see, via David Wessel&#8217;s Twitter feed, that <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/11/05/economy-had-a-heart-attack-and-defibrillators-are-scarce/#">Ricardo Caballero puts forth standard Economics Reasoning</a>:<br />
<blockquote>His idea is likely to give heartburn to many economists and policy makers, who worry about “moral hazard” — the idea that if financial institutions know they’ll be saved in an emergency, they’ll take even greater risks that will inevitably lead to greater disasters.</p>
<p>Don’t fret, says Mr. Caballero: “this moral hazard perspective is the equivalent of discouraging the placement of defibrillators in public places because of the concern that, upon seeing them, people would have a sudden urge to consume cheeseburgers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>After all, we just have to acknowledge that &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; exemptions are the rule, not the exception, for mismanaged businesses.  After all, paying out more in bonuses than you make in a year is a <a target="_blank" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/banker-bonus-rain/?scp=1&#038;sq=bonus&#038;st=cse">Perfectly Reasonable Business Strategy</a>.</p>
<p>*Seriously. The standard example is that people &#8220;don&#8217;t tell the whole truth&#8221; on health insurance applications, so companies <strong>need</strong> to charge them more.  The logical extension of this is that people who tell the whole truth are leaving money on the table, since no insurance company would <em>ever</em> take an <em>ex poste</em> action against people who omit or forget that sprained ankle from thirty years ago.  For an alternate view, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829fa_fact">Malcolm Gladwell</a>.</p>
<p>**There <em>may</em> be an alternate explanation, but this one requires the fewest outlandish assumptions.</p>

<p>The unemployment rate jumped to 10.2%. Except for the peak rate of 10.8% after the 1982 recession this is the highest in the post WW II era.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvQ6SxDF12I/AAAAAAAAA9k/npY7Q9utprY/s1600-h/Clipboard05.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SvQ6SxDF12I/AAAAAAAAA9k/npY7Q9utprY/s320/Clipboard05.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The overall tenor of the report was very similar to the past three months reports and sent the message that the economy is no longer collapsing as it was earlier this year, but it is still in a recession. The encouraging news in the report was that temporary employment improved and that manufacturing hours worked and averge work week improved. This implies that the recession may be over in the manufacturing sector, but not in the service sector.</p>

<p>Because service employment is about 112.5 million versus 11.7 million in manufacturing the improvement in manufacturing was swamped by the continued fall in services. Consequently, aggregate hours worked fell 0.2%. This is similar to the numbers in yesterday&#8217;s productivity report and implies that fourth quarter productivity will also be strong with all that implies for<br />weak employment.</p>

But with oil up about $10 last month this is unlikely to generate an improvement in real wages or income. On the encouraging side, maybe the past years actual decline in nominal personal income growth may be ending.</p>

                                <p>lifted from comments by run 75441</p>
<p>These are comments that I found interesting describing change to manufacturing processes over tha last few decades.  It made for a foil next to Martin ford&#8217;s projections and our understanding of past events.  It is not a post but I learned a few things.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The key example is stamps for bashing metal which shape metal into one form.&#8221;  from Robert&#8217;s post on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/"></a><br />&#8230;..made me smile.</p>
<p>No one buys a stamping press that will make only one part. Stamping companies do buy stamping tooling (that die going into the stamping press) for a particular part. It is very possible to dedicate a stamping press to one part given the capacity of the machine and the volume of the part; however, different tooling can still be inserted into the stamping press dependent upon the machine&#8217;s bed. There is flexibility to buying a stamping press and it can be used for various parts, even in Henry Ford&#8217;s days. There is also flexibility to the stamping tooling by buying progressive dies which will do multiple operations in one press.  </p>
<p>There has also been an evolution from manual machines and automatics to NC and CNC machines over the years. Let’s talk about throughput first though. Everyone is familiar with Henry Ford&#8217;s assembly line were the vehicle in some form of assembly moves down the line. At each station, another part is added until the end when the car is complete. This type of assembly is still being used. What most people didn&#8217;t see was the departments of machines (annealing, stamping, grinding, deburring, welding, turret lathes, automatics, drill presses, etc.) dedicated by function and not by flow of parts to supporting that assembly line These departments were not dedicated to the flow of a part through the plant the same as one might see in the assembly of a car. Each of the departments could be located in the corners of the building creating distances of transportation, requiring multiples of forklifts and labor to move parts from one operation to another, to stock eventually, and then from stock to final assembly (not including the multiple amounts of part inspections).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Magnify this by economic order quantities determined by Demand (months or weeks), Machine Setup (manuals and automatics setups were frequently measured in shifts), etc. It was used to determine a hopefully optimum inventory manufacturing lot based upon constants such as purchasing cost, carrying cost, fixed lead times, demand; which all of them at one time never were constant. The supply chain from customer order, to 100% of the Lot order, and going out the door could be months long . . . i.e. a casting having a 12 week lead time, through, 8 weeks long, etc. There was also a constant battle between Manufacturing, who wished to optimize setup, and typically Materials hoping to optimize inventory (unless they were into build it to be safe mode).</p>
<p>You have a factory setup by machine function rather than throughput and the functions scattered through the plant. Is it is any wonder why, there was a huge requirement for Labor to move parts, to operate each of the machines by function, have excessive transit distances, and manufacturing times plus lead times??? A part processing spaghetti farm. Using Pareto analysis of the flow of parts through a factory from the routing of operations to make a part, it is, and was entirely possible to achieve a much more efficient layout of a factory by eliminating machine departments by function, layout the shop floor by major part flows from receiving to shipping, and in the end reduce internal transit time and labor required, improve throughput and delivery, and reduce EOQ for a part until manufacturing whined about &#8220;setups.&#8221; All of this could be achieved without buying one CNC machine. It is the process of manufacturing that can make a huge difference.</p>
<p>So what did the CNC and or NC machine do for manufacturing? It combined operations such as drill, threading, boring, and lathe. No longer did a company need a drill press, lathe, etc functionality except for alternative runs,  because all of those operations were resident to one machine. With tooling for each function resident to the machine; setups were reduced, and again there was a reduction of setup, machine, and forklift operators. It also cut down on the size of the plant needed as all of the operations were resident to one machine instead of taking up valuable floor space. The only thing it didn&#8217;t impact was inventory as people like that “feelie-feelie” type of safety in it rather than rely upon capacity and speed of throughput.</p>
<p>I am going to disagree a little with your take on implementing new product or new parts. I would suggest it happened consecutively with the running of old product. While it is true that brown field analysis and change over of the shop floor might be disruptive, it was typically planned for and the necessary inventory laid aside to handle demand. In turn the plant people were used to move machinery around. In the end, the changes were implemented on weekends, holidays, Christmas shutdown, Summer shutdowns, etc. </p>
<p>Is it capital equipment or is it a process called kanban impacting throughput? Kanban doesn&#8217;t have an outlay for its implementation other than to change the way we think about making parts and product, one part or product at a time, in the smallest increment of inventory possible, and correctly each time. It doesn&#8217;t even require computerization (internally) to implement as it is a pull type system rather than a push or build to forecasted demand system. In each operation, the inventory, wait time, operation time, and transit time is minimized. Is the success of Toyota based upon CNC equipment or is it in the process of manufacture itself? You give way to much credit to computerization of machines. There is something else a brewing and I liked Spencer&#8217;s explanation.  </p>
<p>There was a time when one spent a lot of time as an apprentice to operate a lathe or to be a tool and dye maker. You are right; this is a vanishing &#8220;skilled&#8221; capability. Instead we rely upon computer cad cam to image parts and then apply the correct operations needed to shape the part in a Mazak or Cincinnati Milacron CNC. It does not occur quite a quick as you state does; but, it certainly is another consolidation point of various operations.</p>
<p>I consulted at a company called Miami Industries (taken over) in the glorious town of Piqua. I lived in MadCity WI and spent much of my time consulting in Ohio. They were meeting much of their customer order lead times when demanded of them; but, they had difficulties doing so. The process was simple (as I recall): slit and cut flat stock (came in rolls), draw over mandrill and weld, burnish outside to eliminate welding burr, cut to size, bend to shape, plate or coat. The company wanted to know how to improve delivery.  </p>
<p>At 30-someting and looking like doogie-howser, I got no respect and always had an older consultant with me (colonel sanders this time). I went on the plant tour and listen to their spiel. They ran monthly lot sizes (20 day, 5 days/week) and wanted to improve deliver to weekly from whatever it was  . . .  </p>
<p>I looked at the VP of Manufacturing and said; with a 20 day manufacturing lot size, you are averaging 10 day deliveries on any order. &#8220;Oh no, we can get then out in 5 days if needed.&#8221; Yes, but the average is 10 days. Given the size of the Manufacturing Lots planned from the customer orders accumulated, the company having an average throughput of 10 days made sense. If they wanted to improve delivery, than cut the lot sizes to 10 days from 20 days which would increase the turns of the orders on the shop floor. It would be a start towards a much quicker throughput, less inventory on the floor and in stock on either end, and improved delivery.  </p>
<p>&#8220;We can&#8217;t do that because of the setup.&#8221; Change your setup by making it more efficient with tooling resident to the machine, handles instead of nuts and wrenches, and look at the costs of inventory as opposed to setup, etc. The excuses for not doing something were endless and this change did not involve one new piece of capital equipment. I have another word for them; but for now I will settle for  . . . &#8220;whims.&#8221;  Oliver Wight used to call them “cement heads.”</p>
<p>The whole issue revolved around lot sizing. I set out to prove how silly they were and that my average of 10 days was spot-on. They had a shop floor system that collected data on each operation. I was able to look at each Mandrel and ascertain the amount of time for a lot to clear it, the setup times involved, the start of the next operation and total time, and transit times between operations. 75% was sit around time waiting for the operation, 8% was transit time, 10% was setup time and the balance was actual operational time making parts. Oh, an average lead time varied from 9.3 to 10.1 days for an order. Not only was my quoted average correct; but, there was adequate cost savings to be had in inventory reduction to also justify the change. I was hated . . . the life of a throughput analyst!  Don’t chase technology for technology sake.</p></blockquote>
