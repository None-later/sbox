                                <p>by Bruce Webb.  Sorry for two posts in a day. But the raw data is important.<br />OAS (Old Age Survivor) starting 2008 balance $2.023 trillion<br />Intermediate Cost projection for year end $2.216 trillion<br />Low Cost projection for year end  $2.221 trillion<br />Preliminary year end balance $2.203 trillion or up $180 billion for the year.</p>
<p>DI (Disability) starting 2008 balance $214.9 billion<br />Intermediate Cost projection for year end $218.7 billion<br />Low Cost projection for year end $221.3 billion<br />Preliminary year end balance $215.8 billion or up just under $1 billion</p>
<p>Total OASDI surplus for 2008: $180.9 billion<br />Intermediate Cost projection: $196.2 billion<br />Low Cost Projection: $204.0 billion</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll take a program that is spinning off $181 billion surpluses. But I have to say the glass is half empty here. We can expect this to translate to some deterioration in the dates for shortfall and depletion with the release of the Report this spring</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Parts of the blogosphere are in an uproar over some Q&#038;A the other day that some interpreted as Obama putting Social Security &#8216;reform&#8217; on the table. Well for reasons outlined by Barkley Rosser (and posted below by Dan) I don&#8217;t think we have much to worry about to begin with. But even if the Obama team takes a look at Social Security and even if they end up tinkering with it, we still don&#8217;t need to worry. Because there is a big difference between Social Security &#8216;Transformers&#8217; and Social Security &#8216;Fixers&#8217;. Obama is a Fixer.</p>
<p>SS Transformers want to fundamentally change the system, most often into some set of Personal Retirement Accounts (PRAs). The motives of Transformers vary, you have one group whose intellectual leader was Milton Friedman and which drew its original inspiration from some combination of Ayn Rand and F. Hayek. For these people Social Security was either fundamentally immoral (Friedman&#8217;s word) or a dangerous step down the road to serfdom/socialism. Then you have a second group centered on Wall Street that simply saw fees and commissions to be had from a transformed system and a third group whose main motivation seems to be avoiding future claims by Social Security on the General Fund. These latter want to stabilize Social Security at a more or less stable share of GDP under the slogan of &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217;. Now all three groups generally share a belief in the superior efficiency of free markets, that is most may sincerely believe that on balance PRAs will give superior results over the very long term (once you get some transition/legacy costs out of the way), but it really wouldn&#8217;t matter. Each would transform Social Security no matter what the actual outlook for the system as currently configured. Which is why supporters of Social Security cannot allow Transformers to even get their nose under the tent. Because before you know it we have the whole PRA camel inside and no easy way to get him out.</p>
<p>But we can listen to Fixers. Even if like me we really don&#8217;t think there is anything to fix. And I&#8217;ll tell you why under the fold.<br /> This post was originally meant to be the conclusion of <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/01/social-security-crisis-and-reform.html">Social Security: &#8216;Crisis&#8217; and &#8216;Reform&#8217;</a> a post that got so long and tedious that I decided to spare AB readers and instead put it up at the BruceWeb where only diehards and/or the unlucky will stumble on it. In it I discuss the two types of &#8216;crisis&#8217;, that is &#8216;crisis at depletion&#8217; or the date that the Trust Fund goes to zero and &#8216;crisis at shortfall&#8217;, the date that revenue from taxation falls behind cost.</p>
<p>Taking the latter first. &#8216;Crisis&#8217; at shortfall is totally bogus. It implicitly denies that the Trust Fund is a binding obligation and vastly exaggerates what it would take to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xxxvii-financing-shortfall.html">Finance Shortfall</a>. People who push this brand of &#8216;crisis&#8217; knowingly or not are simply pawns of the Transformers. Now unfortunately the Obama plan even as modified falls into this camp. It proposes a solution consisting of directing more money at Social Security in 2019 for a problem which legally and numerically doesn&#8217;t actually manifest itself until about 2030, if it manifests at all. So that is not so good.</p>
<p>On the other hand this proposed solution actually would address the more real &#8216;crisis at depletion&#8217;. Under current projections Social Security will only be able to pay out 78% of the scheduled benefit starting sometime in 2041. Now opinions vary about whether this is really a crisis given that the reduction would still give a real benefit about 25% better than similarly situated retirees get today, but if that cut can be made smaller and/or more distant and done so in a progressive way that doesn&#8217;t reduce opportunities to advance the larger agenda we at least ought to listen. Because a cap increase would serve to reduce the needed benefit cut and move it out in time. So that is not at all all bad. But in any event it is not Transformation.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t believe that Obama is a Transformer. For that matter I don&#8217;t think that anyone on his team, including Jeffrey Liebman (co-author of LMS-a Transforming plan), is committed to Transformation for its own sake. While your true Transformer will never be convinced by arguments from Solvency, that being at best a secondary consideration for them, a Fixer can be so convinced.</p>
<p>But, and this is the important point, as long as you can keep Fixers from incorporating aspects of Transformation into their plans then nothing they do can do much in the way of permanent harm to Social Security, because the end goal of the Fixer is to fix something, and that something can only be the projected benefit reduction at TF depletion. Now there are two ways of tackling that 22% cut. One you can put in place measures that mitigate it. For example you could adjust the schedule in ways that reduce the benefit somewhat in the medium term so as to pay out maybe 90% of the benefit over the long run and so avoid the discontinuity in 2041. Or you could raise the benefit cap in a way that accomplishes much of the same outcome. Or tinker with retirement age. Now personally I am on record opposing benefit cuts and changes in retirement age. And equally am leery at any suggestion that we target taxes in ways that move Social Security away from its insurance model and towards a welfare model. I believe in &#8216;Nothing&#8217;, the proven plan for Social Security. But Fixes are not as likely to be permanent as Transformations. Moreover the practicalities suggest that any proposed fixes will have to be phased in, it being a constant theme that we cannot and should not change the rules for people on the immediate verge of retirement. Even Transformers accept this as an operating political reality, you see this adopted in Butler and Germanis from 1983, in Bush&#8217;s speeches in 2004 and in the subsequent Commission Report.</p>
<p>We saw exactly this with the 1983 Reform, the tax increase was phased in as was the gradual increase in retirement age, (for example my age for full retirement was set at 66 years, four months even though that retirement was at the time forty years away). Meaning we should expect any package of fixes that might be proposed by Obama to be equally phased in and as such subject to change depending on actual outcomes.</p>
<p>For example Obama&#8217;s only defined proposal thus far is for a cap increase. But even that has been deferred to 2019, which is to say right around the time of projected shortfall. We can expect that if the numbers come in in a way that pushes the date of shortfall back then we should expect the date of the tax increase to be pushed back. If part of the package changes the benefit formula in ways that threaten to produce a worse result than the 78% we are faced with today, then the new formula can be scrapped in favor of the old one. If increases in retirement age beyond the ones already scheduled are seen to be unneeded they too can go on the scrap heap. And of course the same goes for tax increases. If for example someone proposed to phase in a .2% a year increase in FICA for ten years and it was clear by year five that we had overcorrected then really not much harm has been done, we can halt or roll back the increases</p>
<p>So we don&#8217;t really need to worry about the Fixers. Certainly we need to keep an eye on them and continually point out the actual data projections and critique the assumptions that underly them, but as long as we keep them from wandering over to Transformer territory all should be well in the long run.</p>

<blockquote><p>Work crews were criticized for spending days moving leaf piles from one side of the street to the other. Unions went on strike to protest the program&#8217;s refusal to pay wages equal to those of the private sector. President Ronald Reagan, a staunch critic of large-scale government programs, was one of the WPA&#8217;s defenders, however. &#8220;Some people,&#8221; he said, &#8220;have called it boondoggle and everything else. But having lived through that era and seen it, no, it was probably one of the social programs that was most practical in those New Deal days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Approximately five percent of its budget was devoted to the arts. WPA alumni include writers Saul Bellow, John Cheever, Ralph Ellison, and Richard Wright, the artist Jackson Pollack, and actor and director Orson Welles.</p>
<p>The WPA was not especially efficient. In Washington, D.C., construction costs typically ran three-to-four times the cost of private work. Although, this was intentional. The WPA avoided cost-saving machinery in order to hire more workers. At its peak, the WPA spent $2.2 billion a year, or approximately $30 billion annually in current dollars.</p></blockquote>
<p> (Total was an equivalent of $170 billion&#8230;rdan)</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>is back to his CDS obsession.</p>
<p>Imagine I&#8217;m a banker and I have this problem that they tell me I have to mark assets to market.  I don&#8217;t like that because it makes my stated profits vary and my bonus depends on accounting profits and I don&#8217;t like the risk.  How can I get around this ?</p>
<p>Well I can set up a special purpose entity and have it write me a CDS on some instrument I hold (<a href="http://theamericanscene.com/2008/12/23/ahi-quanto-a-dir-qual-era-e-cosa-dura-esta-selva-selvaggia-e-aspra-e-forte-che-nel-pensier-rinova-la-paura">they certainly have done this</a>).  </p>
<p>Now this doesn&#8217;t protect me from the risk that my instrument will default, because my special purpose entity won&#8217;t be able to pay up in case of default.  However, it does remove my irritating mark to market problem.  </p>
<p>How ?  Now I have more assets to mark to market &#8211; the original instrument and the CDS that my SPE wrote me.  Well fortunately AA rated AIG has also written CDSs on the same instrument and people are buying and selling AIG-CDSs on the instrument.</p>
<p>So I book my SPE-CDS as equal in value to the AIG-CDS.  Huh ? That&#8217;s crazy.  They are totally different instruments with totally different counterparty risk.  In my example, the SPE has almost no assets, so its CDS is really worthless.  However, the most similar asset which is bought and sold on a market is the AIG-CDS so the mark to market standards tell me to mark the value of my worthless CDS to the value of the AIG-CDS.</p>
<p>I am Enroning.  Enron&#8217;s main scam was to set up special purpose entities and to book Enron&#8217;s claims on the SPEs as assets even though the SPEs were never ever going to pay up.  </p>
<p>Now the scam as I&#8217;ve described it wouldn&#8217;t work &#8212; certainly not after the Enron bankruptcy.  The transaction with my SPE is anything but arms length.  I can&#8217;t pretend the price I chose as both parties in the CDS is a market price.  </p>
<p>However, I think a similar scam can work if I have a friend at another bank who owns the same instruments.  We each set up an SPE to write CDSs for each other.  This transaction is still not arms length (I mean this is a scam) but it looks OK.</p>
<p>I think a lot of this was done, that is, a lot of CDSs were totally fake CDSs which everyone knew wouldn&#8217;t pay as promised if the insured instruments defaulted.  I strongly suspect that a lot of CDSs were really MRSs, that is, a swap of mark to market risk, where one agent buys insurance against changes in the perceived probability of default on an instrument which hasn&#8217;t defaulted yet, but not against actual default.  </p>
<p>It seems to me that such CDSs are not socially useful.  They are useful as an accounting trick so that bankers, traders and hedge fund managers can hide their losses from investing in instruments whose value has declined by fake profits from instruments whose value is falsely marked to the value of a quite different instrument.</p>
<p>Does anyone doubt that people were doing this ?  The question is whether a CDS was ever booked as equal to value to another CDS written by a different entity with different counterparty risk.  Does anyone doubt that the answer is yes ?</p>

<blockquote><p>A few days ago Obama was quoted as saying that &#8220;getting entitlement spending under control&#8221; would be part of the effort to deal with budgetary problems. Most think he is focusing on getting rising medical care costs under control, which was part of his platform. But the question of maybe he might do something with or to social security has arisen, and with Larry Summers whispering in his ear, who wanted to go after the program under Bill Clinton, this may be worrisome. As it is during the campaign, Obama opposed any cuts in benefits or moves to privatization, with his only proposal being to possibly implement fica taxes on those making more than $250,000 per year starting in 2019, if the program needs financial shoring up at that time, with the widely publicized mid-range forecast of the system having that being a year or so after the program is scheduled to start running annual deficits rather than the (large) surpluses it has been running, and will continue to run forever if the very unpublicized low-cost scenario comes to pass.</p>
<p>This is where Bruce Webb and I came in last spring. While the system did not do so last year and certainly will not this year, in a majority of years over the past decade it has done better than that low cost scenario, raising the likelihood that the system may in fact never run a deficit. It may not need any fixing ever, and is just fine as it is. Ain&#8217;t broke and don&#8217;t need no fixin&#8217;. Initially Obama was proposing to implement his added fica tax immediately after taking office. At a certain point, Bruce and I composed a memo laying out the above facts and some others that was sent through channels I shall not discuss to the highest levels of the Obama campaign. Soon thereafter came the change in position to move this proposed change off to 2019, although this decision may have had little to nothing to do with our memo. But I still hold to the position of that memo and hope that Obama is not listening too closely to Summers now on this matter. The system is doing just fine and should be left alone as it is for the duration of his presidency, however long it proves to be.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>These estimates show that all components of the program make important contributions to job creation. The direct spending programs have the largest job bang for the buck. State fiscal relief also has important direct and indirect effects on jobs, and  so very strong job bang for the buck. Tax cuts, though they have no direct jobs effect and generally affect consumer and firm spending only gradually, also have important job creation benefits by the end of the two-year window.2</p>
<p>It is important to note that the jobs effects of temporary broad-based tax cuts would probably be considerably smaller. Large proportions of temporary tax cuts are saved, blunting their stimulatory impact on output and employment. The prototypical recovery package only provides for the first two years of the Making Work Pay tax cut.

<p>This is a side issue.  The outline has few details, but includes little caveats and assumptions that are different from grand announcements of certainty to the public.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.armytimes.com/news/2009/01/military_ptsd_discharge_010709w/">Army Times reports this</a> on the ongoing dilemma of how we treat servicemen from the ME conflicts:</p>
<blockquote><p>In October, a medical evaluation board physician at Bragg recommended that Boyle go through the military disability retirement process for chronic post-traumatic stress disorder — which is supposed to automatically earn him at least a 50 percent disability retirement rating — as well as for chronic headaches. The doctor also diagnosed Boyle with alcohol abuse and said he was probably missing formations due to the medications doctors put him on to treat his PTSD.</p>
<p>But in December, Lt. Gen. John Mulholland, commanding general of the U.S. Army Special Operations Command, signed an order forcing Boyle out on an administrative discharge for a “pattern of misconduct,” and ordering that the soldier pay back his re-enlistment bonus.</p>
<p>Last year, after a number of troops diagnosed with PTSD were administratively forced out for “personality disorders” following combat deployments, the Defense Department changed its rules: The pertinent service surgeon general now must sign off on any personality-disorder discharge if a service member has been diagnosed with PTSD.</p>
<p>“Not even a year later, they’re pushing them out administratively for ‘pattern of misconduct,’ ” said Carissa Picard, an attorney and founder of Military Spouses for Change, a group created in response to the personality-disorder cases. “I’m so angry. We’re seeing it all the time. And it’s for petty stuff.”<br />&#8230;.<br />But counseling at Fort Bragg was also difficult, he said, because there were not enough doctors for more than one counseling session a month, and because he had to explain his story to seven different therapists over two years.<br />&#8230;<br />Paul Sullivan, executive director of Veterans for Common Sense, said the Army should have provided Boyle with legal representation; that Boyle should remain in military therapy until VA processes his claim; that he should get an honorable discharge and go through the disability retirement process; and that the military needs to apply the same rules to “pattern of misconduct” as it does to personality disorders.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Tx1 can put more context on this new angle of what is a chronic dilemma.  Police in the region where I live are asking for training to help deal with the particulars of servicemen discharged with PTSD, as they did twenty years ago with domestic violence cases (considered some of the more dangerous to responding police then).</p>

<p>A Question About Gaza</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to understand the situation in Gaza.  I understand that Israel manages to exert some control over Gaza&#8217;s borders and airspace.  Israel has also tried to choke off the flow of weapons into Gaza and this embargo is being blamed for much of the hardship that residents of Gaza have suffered over the past few years.  Apparently, a significant part of the Gaza population depends on humanitarian aid from the UN, the EU, and even, apparently, Israel.  Additionally, part of the hardship is magnified whenever Israel stops supplying electricity or ceases flows of fuel into the region.</p>
<p>I contrast that with the situation in Israel after its independence.  While Israel now receives a lot of aid from the US, that state of affairs basically began around the 1967, and was largely a relic of the fact that our arch-enemy was helping its client states wipe out the Israelis, and had been for quite a while.  (And yes, wipe out is an accurate choice of words.)  From the beginning, the country was embargoed by its neighbors, and they sure as heck weren&#8217;t about to provide Israel with electricity or fuel or humanitarian aid.  Much of the region&#8217;s shipping lanes were essentially closed to Israeli vessels for many years (sometimes off and on), and the country was subjected to a number of wars for its very survival from the beginning.  Despite this, it managed to first survive, then succeed, then thrive.  </p>
<p>Regardless of one&#8217;s views on the conflict, the question does arise &#8211; why the difference in outcomes?  What would it take for the Palestinians to become the current equivalent of Israel in the mid 1960s, say, given they face a similar, if less daunting, set of circumstances than Israel did?  Heck, what would it take for Egypt or Syria or Lebanon or Jordan to produce a similar set of outcomes?<br />________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>Krugman worries about deflation.  </p>
<p>He performs a simple calculation </p>
<blockquote><p>Now here’s the thing: the slump of the early 1980s produced the Great Disinflation, which brought the core inflation rate down from about 10 to about 4.</p>
<p>This time, however, we entered the slump with a core inflation rate of about 2.5 percent. If we experienced a disinflation comparable to that of the 1980s, that would mean ending up with deflation at a rate of -3.5 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two thoughts</p>
<p>First: the argument is based on the assumption that the change in the inflation rate doesn’t depend on the current inflation rate. If I redid the calculation looking at the change in the log of the inflation rate in the Volker disinflation I sure wouldn’t get to a prediction of a negative inflation rate. That would be a silly calculation, since negative inflation is clearly possible. My point is just that an assumption about functional forms is critical and Krugman&#8217;s calculation is extrapolating linearly far out of sample.</p>
<p>Second: It is possible that a factor in the Volker disinflation was the huge appreciation of the dollar. This made imports cheaper and a decline in the price charged by competitors might have more of an effect than a decline in demand for other reasons (I mean who knows what kind of demand curves price setters imagine).</p>

<p>dares comment on Paul Krugman&#8217;s <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/29/optimal-fiscal-policy-in-a-liquidity-trap-ultra-wonkish/">Optimal Fiscal Policy in a Liquidity Trap.</a>  Krugman argues that, when we are in a liquidity trap, the fiscal authority should use expansionary fiscal policy to keep the unemployment rate exactly at the NAIRU.  Since writing the post, Krugman has been wondering why Obama is so much less ambitious.  </p>
<p>I try to explain after the jump.</p>
<p>Krugman gives one answer.  The strong result requires the assumption that the government uses non-distortionary taxes.  If there are deadweight losses from taxes which are convex in tax rates then one wishes to smooth the path of taxes which might imply less dramatic optimal fiscal policy.</p>
<p>There is something very odd in the model.  Krugman seems to assume that private consumption is exogenous.  He has an Euler equation in which consumption now is a function of consumption in the future, but neither is affected by Government consumption if there is other than full employment.  This is odd.  He clearly assumes that the government has a budget constraint so it isn&#8217;t completely clear to me how he avoids Ricardian equivalence.  I think he just assumes that it is silly, but it is very odd to have an intertemporal model without intertemporal budget constraints.  I think that explaining Ricardian non equivalence might help explain the appeal of relatively cautious fiscal policy.*  </p>
<p>An easy way to get non equivalence is to have new consumers born who don&#8217;t get the benefits of current government consumption but do have to pay for it.  This can mean that private consumption of the currently living is unaffected by the policy now and increased later when we get income on government bonds from the poor young (and their consumption is reduced).  This seems unfair.  Certainly the idea that deficits are a burden on future generations is widespread.  If, pre-crisis, we had optimal intergenerational distribution, the cost of redistribution to the living from the unborn would be second order in the stimulus &#8212; that is a constant times huge squared given the size of the stimulus.  I don&#8217;t see how you can have Ricardian non equivalence, intertemporal optimization and no problem with distribution (I also don&#8217;t see how he gets a multiplier of exactly 1).</p>
<p>In particular to have no crowding out of investment (which is not in the model) the fiscal policy has to jump back to neutral as soon as the economy gets out of the liquidity trap.  I think that means paying back the debt immediately, which would be hard on the young.</p>
<p>However, I think the real reason is that policy makers are convinced that the pre and post liquidity trap policy is wrong wrong wrong with taxes which are too low and government spending which is too high so the public debt is too high.  And, most importantly, they know there isn&#8217;t a fiscal authority &#8212; that fiscal power is divided and Obama sure doesn&#8217;t have all of it.  </p>
<p>What that means is that however quickly the national debt should be retired, it will be retired more slowly.  Krugman&#8217;s model doesn&#8217;t include investment so it doesn&#8217;t have feature that the loose fiscal and tight monetary policy gives full employment with excessive consumption and insufficient investment.</p>
<p>Basically, I think the issue is that<br />1) in the real world, debt built up during the crisis will affect consumption until it is retired which means for a long long time.<br />2) given Pre and post crisis fiscal policy, we are consuming too much and investing too little in normal non liquidity trap periods.</p>
<p>Heyyyy, wait that&#8217;s just the yakker conventional wisdom ?  Can it be that it is an advance on a formal new Keynesian model ?  Can it be that ordinary chit chat is like formal economic modelling except more sophisticated ?  Do you really honestly still doubt that the answers to all of those questions are yes ?</p>
<p>update: * Ooops the model has Ricardian equivalence.  Either the government runs a balanced budget while stimulating the economy (this works fine in the model) or runs up a deficit and then pays it back when the economy exits the liquidity trap.  Tax timeing doesn&#8217;t matter at all, because uhm the model has Ricardian equivalence. Unanticipated government spending is still a stimulus whether or not the it is financed by a deficit (which doesn&#8217;t have any effect because of Ricardian equivalence and the use of lump sum taxes).   Government spending doesn&#8217;t crowd out private spending as agents are eager to supply more at the given fixed price (which is lower than marginal cost because of imperfect competition).  The present value of the stream of C+G can increase so long as the present value of the stream of leisure decreases. </p>
<p>Of course, in the real world, there isn&#8217;t Ricardian equivalence, so the rest of my argument is OK.  It&#8217;s just a &#8220;face reality, national savings decline when the government runs a deficit; look at the data&#8221; argument not an argument required to make the model consistent.   </p>
<p>Sorry for my confusion.  Part of the problem is that Krugman wrote &#8220;The Keynesian thing about the model is the assumption that (3) holds only in expectation&#8221; when he should have written &#8220;The Keynesian thing about the model is the assumption that (5) holds only in expectation&#8221;.  (3) is money demand.  The right hand side of (3) depends on consumption and the nominal interest rate both of which are free variables (in particular i goes to infinity makes money demand go to zero and i goes to zero makes it go to infinity so for any M,P and C there is an i such that (3) holds).  Equation (5) is aggregate supply and it holds only in expectation due to price stickiness even though prices don&#8217;t appear explicitly in (5).  I think the (3) in the quote is just a typo.  </p>
<p>In any case, I don&#8217;t think Obama or Romer or Summers believes in Ricardian equivalence so they have a choice between driving the economy to full employment without increasing the deficit  (possible with a huge tax increase which is politically impossible) or crowding out investment not now, but when the economy emerges from the liquidity trap.</p>
