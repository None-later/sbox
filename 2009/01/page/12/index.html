                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Brad DeLong boldly attempts to exhaustively list the factors which can affect the value of a fixed income asset.   This is some Mac generated i document and I can&#8217;t cut and paste. Go <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/01/delong-what-has-happened-to-milton-friedmans-chicago-school-draft.html#comments">here</a> and search for &#8220;there are four&#8221;. </p>
<p>The four are called &#8220;default&#8221;, &#8220;the safe real interest rate&#8221;, &#8220;risk&#8221;, and adverse selection.</p>
<p>I view the assertion that &#8220;there are four&#8221; as a challenge and quibble after the jump.</p>
<p>First the instruments in question promise nominal payments so the safe interest rate in question is the safe nominal interest rate not the safe real interest rate.  The word &#8220;real&#8221; is essentially a typo.</p>
<p>Second &#8220;default&#8221; and &#8220;risk&#8221; are the same things for fixed income instruments (clearly what Brad is discussing).  By &#8220;risk&#8221; I assume he means &#8220;risk bearing capacity&#8221; or &#8220;risk aversion&#8221;.  However, default is a much broader problem than Brad seems willing to admit.  He counts exactly two sources of default risk &#8212; 1 trillion in housing related defaults and 3 more trillion from defaults caused by the recession.  This leaves out other sources of changes in estimated default risk (not risk aversion or risk bearing caspacity but risk).</p>
<p>That is, I see a fifth cause of the decline in asset values.  I think many assets were over-valued in the past, because the ratings agencies were tricked or cashing in on their late lamented excellent reputations (or both).  The loss of confidence in said agencies causes an increase in estimated risk not because risk has increased or risk aversion has increased but because the old estimates are now known to be bogus.</p>
<p>More generally, risk modeling by traders was similarly complete nonsense.  I don&#8217;t know to what extent the traders were tricked and to what extent they were in on the scam (nor I suspect do they).  </p>
<p>Structured finance created a huge illusion of wealth by creating an illusion of safety.  The financial engineers knew how the agencies rated (the agencies explained for a consulting fee) and how traders estimate &#8220;value at risk&#8221;.  They knew people assumed (or pretended to assume) that all stochastic variables are normally distributed.  Thus it was profitable to sell instruments with skewed returns (fat lower tails) unless the rare negative event occurred during the testing period (in which case the instruments could be re-engineered).  A senior tranche of a pool of moderately risky assets has a skewed distribution. </p>
<p>Similarly money could be made by reducing own variance for a given beta by pooling assets and issuing claims on the pool.  The variance of an average is less than the average variance.  The covariance of an average and the market portfolio is the average covariance.  <a href="http://theamericanscene.com/2008/12/23/ahi-quanto-a-dir-qual-era-e-cosa-dura-esta-selva-selvaggia-e-aspra-e-forte-che-nel-pensier-rinova-la-paura">Thus a claim on a pool of BBB rated corporate bonds was rated AAA</a>.  Turning BBB to AAA is worth a lot of money except for the fact that it was a scam (investors could pool themselves &#8212; they don&#8217;t seem to have understood that pre-pooling reduces the benefit to them of their own pooling &#8212; or they were in on the scam).</p>
<p>That is there were trillions of fantasy dollars created out of nothing by financial engineering (on top of whatever real wealth had been created by financial engineering which genuinely made better insurance and diversification possible).  The loss of that illusion can&#8217;t be estimated easily as  &#8220;housing related defaults&#8221; (and note my example has nothing to do with housing or recessions).  </p>
<p>The risk of a nationwide decline in house prices was estimated at 0 by S&#038;P (I am not exaggerating).  Now there has been such a decline, and they must admit that there is the risk of another such decline in the future.  Even if the current decline costs just $ 1 trillion, the future possible declines also cost money.</p>
<p>So much of the wealth was an illusion which won&#8217;t come back soon.  This end of systematic miss-estimation of risk is not on your list.</p>
<p>Also institutions took huge gigantic bets against each other (as in AIG lost writing CDSs).  This increases counter party risk.  No one knows if a counter party is solvent.  That reduces the value of a huge number of instruments.  The damage could have been done without involving the housing industry or the stock market if, say, investment bank CEOs played a really high stakes poker game and all claimed to have won money.  Also bankruptcy is costly.  Even if the CEOs had played hundred billion ante poker on camera, wealth would have been destroyed and more wealth would have been shifted from investors to lawyers.  This is another item not on your list.</p>
<p>Finally, much of the strange new finance was designed to help agents avoid prudential rules and regulations which they considered to be costly.  Now they have learned two things.  First that the regulations weren&#8217;t so pointless so they will have to pay that cost to avoid bankruptcy.  Second they will be audited by banking regulators, trustees etc and found wanting.   This last point is semi redundant as it amounts to an increase in perceived risk or a reduction in perceived capacity to bear risk (default or risk in Brad&#8217;s terms).  However, it explains why I keep speculating that this that or the other operator was in on the scam.</p>

<p>It is hard to find anything positive about this employment report.  Maybe the best news is the nominal weekly earnings only fell by 0.3%.</p>
<p>Since the peak in employment in November household employment has fallen to 97.7% and is<br />now worse than the declines in the 1974 and 1981 recessions.</p>

Even assuming decent productivity growth this implies that fourth quarter real GDP growth will be worse than<br />the -4% to -5% consensus expectations.</p>

Yet our Republican friends say we should continue the policies that generated this record.  Just do not learn do they?</p>

<p>One of the advantages of participating in a blog community is to read the variety of voices that also participate.  This blog not only has a stable of writers (which has changed over the years), but it also has a number of regulars who leave comments (or send e-mail to the writers now and again!) and rarely, if ever send in a &#8220;main post.&#8221;  In many ways, these people are the heart and soul of the blog community; if those regulars, through their comments, keep the writers honest and enforce intellectual rigor, the blog&#8217;s output improves, and it becomes a place worth visiting.  If there are no such regulars, or they are willing to tolerate nonsense, often the result will be garbage.</p>
<p>Angry Bear is a very good blog, in my opinion, and if my opinion is correct, it is because we have those regulars who keep the rest of us (and I admit &#8211; I&#8217;m not as active these days as I was a year or so ago) honest and rigorous.  We at Angry Bear have lost one such regular, with the passing, not long ago, of OldVet.  His name will be familiar to you if you&#8217;re a long time reader; he contributed comments for years, and also produced a number of guest posts.</p>
<p>OldVet passed away on October 11 from liver cancer, a relic of the hepatitis he picked up while serving his country in Vietnam.  His wife, Emily, wrote that he</p>
<blockquote><p>kept his sense of humor to the end, and did not really suffer.  He also got to vote absentee 2 days before he died.  Of course it&#8217;s very sad he&#8217;s not here to see Obama inaugurated, and had missed all the market turmoil the last few months.  He would so have enjoyed following these markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Emily also wrote the next few paragraphs.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<blockquote><p>In Memoriam for OldVet:  Donald Paul Trader</p>
<p>NPR recently quoted Lincoln as saying “And in the end it&#8217;s not the years in your life that count. It&#8217;s the life in your years.”  Donald Trader, aka “OldVet” died of liver cancer at the age of 62 on 11 October 2008 in Columbia, Tennessee.  Donald was a frequent contributor to AngryBear after his retirement, but his years were filled with life.</p>
<p>Ever precocious &#8212; he graduated high school at 16 in Savannah Georgia.  He was a military intelligence officer during the Vietnam war, earned an international degree at Georgia State University and studied at the London School of Economics.  Later he was a Sky Marshall in the government’s skyjacking prevention program.  From there, his varied career took him to the State Department and the Department of Commerce as a Foreign Service Officer and Commercial Counselor.  He would serve in Haiti, Germany, the Netherlands, Saudi Arabia and the Philippines.</p>
<p>He had a falling out with Reagan administration over supporting dictators (he didn’t) and enjoyed the Flower Power Revolution of 1986 in Manila, after which he was kicked out of the U.S. government.  He would return after several years as a marketing consultant. Donald spent his final career years as a Senior Economist with the Department of the Treasury where he saved taxpayers many millions of dollars before retiring in 2006.</p>
<p>His wide experiences and keen intellect gave him a unique perspective on life and those around him.  Donald was an artist and a writer.  He loved his family, his country, good books, the arts, the sea, and stimulating conversation.  He did not suffer fools.  In his quiet moments he enjoyed sitting on his porch admiring the 200 trees he and Emily planted.  Donald&#8217;s generosity, wry sense of humor, and his ability to create excitement and consternation everywhere he went will be greatly missed by those who knew him. </p>
<p>In closing I leave you a Don quote: </p>
<p>“When you bring your head up out of your computer and quit yakking on the phone, you find life happening all around you.  Change is good.”  Bella, the subject, tried to “kill him” last summer (I’ll spare the details), but also “stole his fucking chicken”.  The chicken story is good.  Don was not supposed to have fried foods or salty foods.  I was out of town at a convention.  Don had honchoed the replacement of our kitchen floor with wood floors – workmen hammering, singing (different songs), and radio for days.  When it ended he drove the 12 miles and back to get a 2 piece dinner at KFC.  He fixed a plate, glass of tea, and set it on the sofa end table while he went to get in his lounge/PJs to be comfortable. When he came back his chicken breast was gone – and he saw Bella had it.  He chased her (and she is elusive) until he got the breast away.</p></blockquote>
<p>To this I would add:  OldVet could discuss all sorts of things, from details of transfer pricing regulations to Brazilian literature.  And when he was writing about something I knew something about, I could tell you with certainty &#8211; he knew what he was writing.  I imagine the same must be true of when he wrote about other topics.</p>
<p>I’d also like to add something <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/03/oldvet-on-pessimist-view-of-us-economy.html">OldVet wrote</a> almost two years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>While neither an alarmist nor a pessimist by outlook when it comes to the US economy, I&#8217;ve been reading a whole host of warnings lately. (Disclosure: There are many places to turn for opinions and you can always find some that agree with your beliefs. I&#8217;m frankly very concerned and very &#8220;short&#8221; all equity markets for now.) These warnings either focus on (1) how the changed nature of mortgage lending in the last several years is leading to a mortgage market contraction, (2) to warnings that risk generally has become mis-priced by investors in broader markets. I&#8217;ve been disturbed to note that some $57 billion was quietly flung into the financial markets by the Fed and the Treasury Department in the last two days of last week through short term lending operations. </p></blockquote>
<p>I’d also like to share this cartoon OldVet drew.  Regular readers may recall that when he provided a main post to Angry Bear, he usually also provided some artwork to go along with the narrative.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SWVM6l3PONI/AAAAAAAAAcY/15oNXQGi4_c/s1600-h/Donald_Arte_de_Bella.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SWVM6l3PONI/AAAAAAAAAcY/15oNXQGi4_c/s320/Donald_Arte_de_Bella.JPG" alt="" border="0"></a>Emily tells me the story behind the cartoon is this:</p>
<p>The post goes on, giving a lot reason for concern, concern that it is a pity many people who should have known better and had more information at their disposal apparently didn&#8217;t feel.</p>
<p>OldVet helped make Angry Bear feel like a community for me, and that at a time that I really needed Angry Bear to serve such a role in my life.  Conversely, the blog gave me a connection to this man who I never met, but who, I am glad was my friend.</p>
<p>Finally, Emily was kind enough to send a few pictures.</p>
<p>This one comes from a day that OldVet always thought of as one of the happiest of his life:</p>

<p>This one is from about six months ago, when his health was already failing:</p>

I thought it would take a Japanese style depression scenario for yields to fall to the solid line glide path. That now appears to be happening.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/08/AR2009010804109.html?hpid=topnews">The Washington Post</a> reports a set of guiding principles for the rescue is in the works:</p>
<blockquote><p>Geithner has been working night and day on the eighth floor of the transition team office in downtown Washington with Lawrence H. Summers and other senior economic advisers to hash out a new approach that would expand the program&#8217;s aid to municipalities, small businesses, homeowners and other consumers. With lawmakers stewing over how Bush administration officials spent the first $350 billion, Geithner has little chance of winning congressional approval for the second half without retooling the program, the sources added.</p>
<p>That challenge is underscored by a report from a congressional oversight panel scheduled to be released today that hammers the outgoing Treasury Department for its handling of the financial rescue, including &#8220;what appear to be significant gaps in Treasury&#8217;s monitoring of the use of taxpayer money.&#8221; The report, moreover, faults the Treasury for failing to properly measure the success of the program or establish an overall strategy and skewers the department for not using any of the funds on foreclosure relief as Congress had directed.</p>
<p>Much of the work by Obama&#8217;s team has focused on establishing principles that would clearly define the program&#8217;s course and the conditions of government aid to financial firms. </p></blockquote>

He begins by acknowledging the effect of Hamas rockets into southern Israel:</p>
<blockquote><p>After visiting Sderot last April and seeing the serious psychological damage caused by the rockets that had fallen in that area, my wife, Rosalynn, and I declared their launching from Gaza to be inexcusable and an act of terrorism. Although casualties were rare (three deaths in seven years), the town was traumatized by the unpredictable explosions.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then puts things into context, something the likes of Harry Reid and other U.S. leaders simply do not have the moral spine to do.</p>
<blockquote><p>We knew that the 1.5 million inhabitants of Gaza were being starved, as the U.N. special rapporteur on the right to food had found that acute malnutrition in Gaza was on the same scale as in the poorest nations in the southern Sahara, with more than half of all Palestinian families eating only one meal a day.</p>
<p>Palestinian leaders from Gaza were noncommittal on all issues, claiming that rockets were the only way to respond to their imprisonment and to dramatize their humanitarian plight. The top Hamas leaders in Damascus, however, agreed to consider a cease-fire in Gaza only, provided Israel would not attack Gaza and would permit normal humanitarian supplies to be delivered to Palestinian citizens.</p>
<p>After extended discussions with those from Gaza, these Hamas leaders also agreed to accept any peace agreement that might be negotiated between the Israelis and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, who also heads the PLO, provided it was approved by a majority vote of Palestinians in a referendum or by an elected unity government. </p></blockquote>
<p>Carter passed this message to the Egyptians, who, in all likelihood, passed it on to the Israelis.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>After about a month, the Egyptians and Hamas informed us that all military action by both sides and all rocket firing would stop on June 19, for a period of six months, and that humanitarian supplies would be restored to the normal level that had existed before Israel&#8217;s withdrawal in 2005 (about 700 trucks daily). </p></blockquote>
<p>Note: the increase was to an &#8220;average of about 20 percent of normal levels. Imagine yourselves walled inside of Gaza.</p>
<p>And what happened next?</p>
<p>
<blockquote>I made an effort for the impending six-month deadline to be extended. It was clear that the preeminent issue was opening the crossings into Gaza. Representatives from the Carter Center visited Jerusalem, met with Israeli officials and asked if this was possible in exchange for a cessation of rocket fire. The Israeli government informally proposed that 15 percent of normal supplies might be possible if Hamas first stopped all rocket fire for 48 hours. This was unacceptable to Hamas, and hostilities erupted</p></blockquote>
<p>Fifteen percent of normal supplies?  You have to be kidding.  As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/09/world/middleeast/09vatican.html?_r=1" targe="_blank">Cardinal Martino</a> said,</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Look at the conditions in Gaza: more and more, it resembles a big concentration camp.”</p></blockquote>
<p>We all have read of the horrors the invasion has visited on Gaza: starving children huddled around a dead mother; Israeli forces <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/09/world/middleeast/09mideast.html?hp" target="_blank">attacking humanitarian</a> relief efforts even when those efforts signal in every possible way their movements in Gaza.</p>
<p>This moral horror seems to be a popular election platform for Barak. But there are voices inside Israel, indeed, inside southern Israel, in one of those very towns that have received Hamas rockets that do understand. While the moral compass of the U.S. and official Israel is off the charts,  <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2009/1/5/israeli_professor_neve_gordon_condemns_israeli" target="_blank">Neve Gordon</a>, chair of the Department of Politics and Government, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Israel states the problem precisely:<br />
<blockquote>Well, we just had a rocket about an hour ago not far from our house. My two children have been sleeping in a bomb shelter for the past week. And yet, I think what Israel is doing is outrageous, as opposed to what Meagan said before. We have here a situation where actually Israel did leave the Gaza Strip three years ago, but it maintains sovereignty in any political science sense of the term. We’ve controlled all the borders. We’ve basically had an economic boycott on the Gaza Strip. And the people there have been living in what one should probably call as a prison. And they’ve been reacting with rockets, because probably that’s the only way that they can react. </p></blockquote>
<p>They have been &#8220;living in a prison&#8230;reacting with rockets.&#8221; Cardinal Martino had it right: More and more it resembles a big concentration camp.</p>
<p>I need not tell you the U.S. media take on all this. You hear it everyday. Hear it enough and you will believe it.</p>
<p>And where is Obama in all this? Silence. Not a word. Now that may seem politically astute. It is not. I leave that last assertion for the more astute of you to argue. For those of you who want to sling mud at Carter, I would suggest, politely, that attacking the messenger and not the message is a weak rhetorical device. For those of you who wish to be outraged by Martino&#8217;s or Gordon&#8217;s assessment, I suggest you look at the facts. Israel has lost its way&#8211;and is dragging the U.S. down with it.</p>
