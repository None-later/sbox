Each drawing his particular hope and fear from this WaPo article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/15/AR2009011504114.html?wprss=rss_business">Obama Pledges Entitlement Reform: President-Elect Says He&#8217;ll Reshape Social Security, Medicare Programs</a> Well I am STILL not worried because the two (Bush and Obama) are coming at this from very different starting points.</p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s position is outlined pretty clearly on the Obama 2008 website<br />
<blockquote>Obama and Biden are committed to ensuring Social Security is solvent and viable for the American people, now and in the future. Obama and Biden will be honest with the American people about the long-term solvency of Social Security and the ways we can address the shortfall. Obama and Biden will protect Social Security benefits for current and future beneficiaries alike. And they do not believe it is necessary or fair to hardworking seniors to raise the retirement age. Obama and Biden are strongly opposed to privatizing Social Security. As part of a bipartisan plan that would be phased in over many years, they will ask those making over $250,000 to contribute a bit more to Social Security to keep it sound.<br />Obama does not support uncapping the full payroll tax of 12.4 percent rate. Instead, he and Joe Biden are considering plans that would ask those making over $250,000 to pay in the range of 2 to 4 percent more in total (combined employer and employee).</p></blockquote>
<p>No increase in retirement age, no privatization. I just don&#8217;t see enough in this from the WaPo to suggest he has fundamentally moved away from his previously stated position.<br />
<blockquote>Five days before taking office, Obama was careful not to outline specific fixes for Social Security and Medicare, refusing to endorse either a new blue-ribbon commission or the concept of submitting an overhaul plan to Congress that would be subject only to an up-or-down vote, similar to the one used to reach agreement on the closure of military bases. But the president-elect exuded confidence that his economic team will succeed where others have not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Social Security, we can solve,&#8221; he said, waving his left hand. &#8220;The big problem is Medicare, which is unsustainable. . . . We can&#8217;t solve Medicare in isolation from the broader problems of the health-care system.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Which translates to me as &#8220;(SS) small problem down the road&#8221; vs &#8220;(Medicare) big issue needing action now&#8221;. That is on Social Security Obama is by temperament a Fixer. In contrast Bush started as a Transformer. To see the difference we need to start with the mission statement of the 2001 Commission. Which is below the fold.<br />A link to their full (13 MB PDF) report can be found on the home page of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csss.gov/">President&#8217;s Commission to Strengthen Social Security</a> but pretty much all you need to know is outlined in the &#8216;Guiding Principles&#8217;<br />
<blockquote>Guiding Principles<br />The Commission was asked to make recommendations to modernize and restore fiscal soundness to Social Security, using six guiding principles:<br />•Modernization must not change Social Security benefits for retirees or near-retirees.<br />•The entire Social Security surplus must be dedicated only to Social Security.<br />•Social Security payroll taxes must not be increased.<br />•The government must not invest Social Security funds in the stock market.<br />•Modernization must preserve Social Security`s disability and survivors insurance programs.<br />•Modernization must include individually controlled, voluntary personal retirement accounts, which will augment Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is the Commission was not tasked with studying Social Security in the larger financial context of Medicare and the General Fund deficit. It wasn&#8217;t even tasked with studying Social Security in isolation and coming back with recommendations on how to fix it. Instead certain categories of fix are ruled out right from the start. No direct investment by Social Security in the stock market (which would capture the much touted equity premium). No increase in payroll taxes (sorry Coberly, the Commission was not even allowed to discuss it). Nope the Commission was given perfect freedom to come up with a plan. As long as the plan included individually controlled, voluntary personal retirement accounts. Meaning that when Bush was claiming in 2004 that &#8220;all options are on the table&#8221; he was pretty much fibbing. He knew what he wanted and what he wanted was Transformation.</p>
<p>Andrew Biggs can hear all the echoes he wants, I just am not convinced Obama has drank any kind of Kool-Aid here.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://tradeandtaxes.blogspot.com/2009/01/levy-economics-institute-of-bard.html">Real Keynesians understand imbalanced trade</a></p>
<p>by Howard Richman</p>
<p>The United States is being run by pseudo-Keynesians who probably learned their Keynesian economics from an introductory economics textbook. Unlike real Keynesians they do not understand trade deficits.</p>
<p>For example, Obama&#8217;s primary economic advisors Lawrence Summers and Timothy Geithner think that one of the biggest challenges facing American policy makers is to persuade the American public not to do anything about the trade deficits. Summers&#8217; and Geithner&#8217;s strategy is to first solve the recession through a Keynesian stimulus package and only after that address Chinese currency manipulations.</p>
<p>Real Keynesians don&#8217;t think like these incompetents. Real Keynesians understand that the US trade deficit lies at the heart of our current problems. In past postings, I&#8217;ve already cited two examples of what real Keynesians say:</p>
<p>    * Richard Duncan predicted this global depression in his 2003 book. He argued that global aggregate supply is beginning to outrun global aggregate demand as the countries pursuing export-oriented growth are producing more and more goods without a corresponding increase in income among worldwide consumers. In other words, the excess of savings over investment in the export-oriented countries will drive the world economy into a depression. Eventually, he predicted, US consumers will not be able to borrow more for consumption. Like other debtors they will be forced to pullback, causing the depression.<br />    * George Manbiot pointed out that, according to Keynes, trade deficits in debtor countries cause financial crises. Keynes, himself advocated that the international economic system be built in a way that would guarantee that trade would stay in balance.</p>
<p>The latest evidence of what Keynesians think comes from the December 2008 Strategic Analysis put together by the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College. I learned about their analysis from a commentary by William Greider that will appear in the February 2 edition of The Nation. He wrote:</p>
<p>    While Washington debates the terms of Obama&#8217;s stimulus package, others see disappointment ahead. The Levy Economics Institute of Bard College, an outpost of Keynesian thinking, expresses its doubts in emotional language that professional economists seldom use. &#8220;The prospects for the US economy have become uniquely dreadful, if not frightening,&#8221; Levy analysts reported. The institute&#8217;s updated strategic analysis warns that the magnitude of negative forces&#8211;the virtual collapse of bank lending, private spending, consumer incomes and demand&#8211;&#8220;will make it impossible for US authorities to apply a fiscal and monetary stimulus large enough to return output and unemployment to tolerable levels within the next two years.&#8221; Instead, the unemployment rate is likely to rise to 10 percent by 2010. Obama&#8217;s package amounts only to around 3 percent, annually, of GDP in a $13 trillion economy. Levy&#8217;s analysis calculates that it would require federal deficits of 8 to 10 percent of GDP&#8211;$2 trillion or more&#8211;to reverse the economic contraction. And yet, the institute observed, it is inconceivable that this level &#8220;could be tolerated for purely political reasons&#8221; or that the United States could sustain the rising indebtedness without terrifying our leading creditors, like China.</p>
<p>The Strategic Analysis, authored by Wynne Godley, Dimitri B. Papadimitriou and Genarro Zezza, can be read online. They begin with the trade deficit, pointing out that the private borrowing that sustained the trade deficit during the early part of this decade could not continue. Here is how they put it:</p>
<p>    The balance of payments [i.e, the trade balance] (which had been zero in 1992) then moved even further into deficit, on a scale never seen before, reaching over 6 percent of GDP in 2006. Despite the growing subtraction from aggregate demand as a result of this adverse trend, the U.S. economy continued to grow at a satisfactory rate because the balance of payments deficit was offset by a large and growing fall in personal net saving that was fed by a renewed rise in net lending to the private sector, the counterpart to the disgraceful boom in subprime and other ending.</p>
<p>    It should again have been obvious that these trends could not continue for long. As early as 2004, in a Strategic Analysis subtitled Why Net Exports Must Now Be the Motor for U.S. Growth, we argued that continued growth in net lending to the private sector was an impossibility, and that at some stage there would have to be a collapse both in lending and in private expenditure relative to income. It would not be possible to save the situation by applying another fiscal stimulus as in 2001, because that would increase the budget deficit to about 8 percent of GDP, implying that the public debt would then be hurtling toward 100 percent of GDP, with more to come. As these processes were nevertheless allowed to continue, we perforce had to bring the short-term prospect into sharper focus. As the turnaround in net lending eventually became manifest, we predicted in our November 2007 Analysis — without being too precise about timing — that, as a result, there would be a recession in 2008. At that time we entertained the possibility that, with the dollar so low, net exports might save the day, after an uncomfortable period of recession.</p>
<p>    The processes by which U.S. output was sustained through the long period of growing imbalances could not have occurred if China and other Asian countries had not run huge current account surpluses, with an accompanying “saving glut” and a growing accumulation of foreign exchange reserves that prevented their exchange rates from falling enough, flooding U.S. financial markets with dollars and thereby helping to finance the lending boom. Some economists have gone so far as to suggest that the growing imbalance problem was entirely the consequence of the saving glut in Asian and other surplus countries. In our view, there was an interdependent process in which all parties played an active role. The United States could not have maintained growth unless it had been happy to sponsor, or at least permit, private sector (particularly personal sector) borrowing on such an unprecedented scale&#8230;.</p>
<p>They predict that private borrowing in the United States will fall by 14% of GDP between the 4th quarter of 2008 and 1st quarter of 2009, specifically:</p>
<p>    The implication of these assumptions is that net lending to the private sector falls by about 14 percent of GDP between the first quarter of 2008 and the first quarter of 2009—a drop that has already largely occurred—and that net lending continues negative for a long time after that.</p>
<p>    In our view, the unprecedented drop in interest rates recently engineered by the Federal Reserve may not be effective in reactivating standard lending practices, unless confidence in future profits and income growth is restored. However, low interest rates will keep mortgage payments low, sustaining disposable income and helping the economy to recover.</p>
<p>They continue with predictions for the next few years. Their main prediction: &#8220;GDP will fall about 12 percent below trend between now and 2010, while unemployment will rise to about 10 percent.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although they advocate stimulus packages, they also note that balanced trade must be part of the solution. Specifically:</p>
<p>    It is a central contention of this report that the virtual collapse of private spending will make it impossible for U.S. authorities to apply a fiscal and monetary stimulus large enough to return output and unemployment to tolerable levels within the next two years&#8230;.</p>
<p>    Fiscal policy alone cannot, therefore, resolve the current crisis. A large enough stimulus will help counter the drop in private expenditure, reducing unemployment, but it will bring back a large and growing external imbalance [trade deficit], which will keep world growth on an unsustainable path.</p>
<p>    At the moment, the recovery plans under consideration by the United States and many other countries seem to be concentrated on the possibility of using expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. But, however well coordinated, this approach will not be sufficient.</p>
<p>    What must come to pass, perhaps obviously, is a worldwide recovery of output, combined with sustainable balances in international trade.</p>
<p>Their predictions for the size of the trade deficit depend upon the size of the stimulus package. If GDP is allowed to collapse the trade deficit will disappear. The larger the stimulus package, the larger the trade deficit (which they call the &#8220;balance of payments deficit&#8221;):</p>
<p>    By our reckoning (which is put forward with great diffidence), if the United States now attempts to restore full employment by fiscal and monetary means alone, the balance of payments deficit will rise over the next, say, three to four years to 6 percent of GDP or more—that is, to a level that could not possibly be sustained for a long period, let alone indefinitely. Yet, for trade to begin expanding sufficiently would require exports to grow faster than we are at present expecting, implying that in three to four years the level of exports would be 25 percent higher than it would have been with no adjustment.</p>
<p>In his commentary in The Nation, Greider makes a similar point:</p>
<p>    To put it crudely, Obama&#8217;s stimulus program might restart factories in China while leaving US unemployment painfully high. In fact, some leakage may occur via the very banks or industrial corporations that taxpayers have generously assisted. What prevents Citigroup and General Motors from using their fresh capital to enhance overseas operations rather than investing at home? The new administration will therefore have to rethink the terms of globalization before its domestic initiatives can succeed&#8230;.</p>
<p>In other words, trying to stimulate the economy without fixing the trade deficit is like trying to pump up a tire without fixing the leak. Both the Levy Economics Institute and William Greider see the same problem that we do. THE STIMULUS PACKAGE WON&#8217;T WORK UNLESS TRADE IS BROUGHT TOWARD BALANCE AT THE SAME TIME! Here is Greider&#8217;s solution:</p>
<p>    A global recovery compact would require extremely difficult diplomacy but could be possible because it is in everyone&#8217;s self-interest. The United States could propose the outlines with one crucial condition: if the trading partners are unwilling to act jointly, Washington will have to proceed unilaterally. A grand bargain could start with US agreement to serve once again as the main engine that pulls the global economy out of the ditch. That is, the United States will have to continue as the buyer of last resort for the next few years, and China and other nations will have to bail us out with still more lending. In the short run, this would dig us into a deeper hole, but the United States could insist on a genuinely reformed system and mutually agreed return to balanced trade, once global recovery is under way.</p>
<p>    Congress can enact the terms now&#8211;a ceiling on US trade deficits that will decline steadily to tolerable levels, as well as new rules for US multinational enterprises that redefine their obligations to the home economy. Unlike in other advanced nations, US companies get a free ride from their home government when they relocate production abroad. That has to change if the United States is to reverse its weakening world position. Tax penalties plus national economic policy can drive US multinationals to keep more of their value-added production at home. These measures can be enforced through the tax code and, if necessary, a general tariff that puts a cap on imports. Formulating these provisions now for application later, once the worst of the crisis is over, would give every player the time to adjust investment strategies gradually.</p>
<p>Greider&#8217;s solution would definitely be a great improvement over what we have now. But it would take cooperation from all the parties involved, including the other countries in the world and American corporations.</p>
<p>In contrast, the solution that we present in our book Trading Away Our Future would work without requiring anything more than US government action. For example, if you plug one of the Import Certificate plans we recommend into the Levi Economics analysis you discover that it instantly causes a recovery:</p>
<p>    * American exports increase because they earn Import Certificates.<br />    * Investment in American factories increases because American production becomes profitable.<br />    * American consumer spending increases because American income increases.<br />    * Import Certficates by a trade deficit country don&#8217;t cause a trade war. They tie imports to exports. Any trade-surplus country that tries to counter the certificates by reducing its own imports of American goods finds that it is thereby reducing its exports.</p>
<p>The Levi Economics Institute and William Greider deserve a lot of credit for facing the problems honestly. But we are still the only ones with a simple solution that could be immediately put into practice.<br />Posted by Howard Richman at 12:01 AM <br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />lifted from Trade and Taxes</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>What can we learn from really bad arguments ?  </p>
<p>I think it is useful to examine plainly invalid arguments, because the error in thought which they grossly manifest might contaminate less obviously idiotic contributions to the discussion.</p>
<p>A few arguments are so dumb that they have remained fixed in my mind.  Most of them are not due to Mickey Kaus, but two are.  They illustrate the same fallacy.  I discuss one <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2009/01/can-mickey-kaus-count-to-four-i-have.html">here</a>.  </p>
<p>The other is Mickey Kaus&#8217;s argument that liberals should not concern themselves with inequality of income.  After the jump, I will critique my recollection of this argument.</p>
<p>Update:  I appear to have inadvertantly slandered St Bonaventura (more often spelled Bonaventure by people who don&#8217;t live in Italy) when I compared his reasoning to Kaus&#8217;s.  St B might thank mALACLYPSE in comments.</p>
<p>IIRC Kaus argued that there is clearly an increasing trend in income inequality in developed countries.  He was struck, in particular, by the fact, that inequality had increased in Sweden so the change in income inequality over the preceding 10 years had been positive in both Sweden and the USA, which have notably different approaches to dealing with inequality.  </p>
<p>Then Kaus implicitly assumed that all positive numbers are approximately equal and concluded that the evidence proved that there was nothing much to be done about increasing income inequality and that we should just accept it as inevitable.  </p>
<p>Anyone who <a href="http://emlab.berkeley.edu/users/saez/piketty-saezAEAPP06.pdf">reads this paper (warning pdf)</a>, must notice that the argument is, shall we say, not proven by evidence which became available after Kaus made his argument and implicit prediction.  There aren&#8217;t developed countries in which inequality has declined much in recent decades, but there are developed countries in which measured inequality hasn&#8217;t increased noticeably.  The increase in the USA is clearly extraordinary.</p>
<p>In any case, an argument based on the assumption that all positive numbers are approximately equal is worthless (note I resisted the temptation to write &#8220;approximately worthless&#8221;).  </p>
<p>The total worthlessness of Kaus&#8217;s argument becomes, if possible, more obvious, if we consider how he might have argued if the data had been different.  Equally valid (that is worthless) arguments can be made for not trying to do anything about income inequality if it is clearly trending up, clearly trending down or has no clear trend.   In fact, the argument for not bothering based on the clear widespread downward trend (up until the 70&#8217;s roughly) was much more convincing that Kaus&#8217;s.  If inequality in market economies trends down, then we might hope that it will more or less vanish (it can&#8217;t be less than zero).  So why worry ?  </p>
<p>The argument based on the absence of a clear trend actually has a noble pedigree.  Pareto argued, based on the fact that he found no clear trend in inequality, that it is a social constant and will always be about the same.  Therefore he concluded there wasn&#8217;t much point trying to do anything about it.</p>
<p>Now if there are three possibilities and they all imply the same highly controversial conclusion via arguments of clearly similar validity, we should guess that all three are of roughly zero validity.</p>
<p>The more recent example of an clearly invalid argument from Kaus, teaches us nothing new about reasoning.  It just shows that Kaus still relies on the assumption that all positive numbers are approximately equal.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t actually read many arguments made by Kaus (after the first I encountered which is the one discussed above, I decided it wasn&#8217;t good for my health).  So, I&#8217;ve read a few, certainly less than 10 (my honest guess is at most 3) and, it seems to me, that two of them develop the implications of the assumption that all postive numbers are approximately equal.</p>
<p>I conclude that Kaus really thinks that way, and sees nothing wrong with the assumption.</p>
<p>I am not exaggerating.  This is my sincere opinion, expressed without hyperbole, and held with considerable confidence.</p>
<p>For another example, 30 years ago, I tried to figure out what was wrong with the ontological proof of the existence of God made by Saint <strike>Bonaventura </strike> Anselm based on a possibly unfair translation which begins with a definition of the word &#8220;God&#8221;</p>
<p>God n. A being more sublime than any other conceivable being.</p>
<p>Then proceeds to note that if God did not exist, then it would be possible to conceive of a being which had all of God&#8217;s other sublime characteristics and further more had the characteristic of &#8220;existence&#8221;.  This contradicts the definition of God.  Therefore God exists.</p>
<p>Now even assuming for the sake of argument, that God does in fact exist, there is clearly something wrong with this argument.  One has to wonder whether the same thing is also wrong with arguments that have convinced one.  I didn&#8217;t get very far in my effort to figure out what was wrong with the argument, but there was this guy named Willard Quine who did and wrote the arguments down in this little book &#8220;From a Logical Point of View.&#8221;</p>
<p>There are two problems.  First, the general rule of debate is that people are allowed to define terms.  At most, they may be prevented from redefining an existing word and forced to define a neologism (so <strike>Bonaventura</strike> St. Anselm would only prove the existence of the most sublime conceivable being God2 if the word &#8220;God&#8221; was taken).  This general rule is no good, as definitions are not necessarily &#8220;innocent&#8221;.  We can&#8217;t allow people the authority to just state a definition, because such a statement may have implications which are false.  Here <strike>Bonaventura</strike> St. Anselm is defining &#8220;God&#8221; and defining &#8220;sublime&#8221; so that &#8220;existence&#8221; is one form of sublimity. </p>
<p>Instead, we might hope to make rules for defining terms such that only innocent definitions &#8212; definitions which can&#8217;t be false statements &#8212; are allowed.  Quine&#8217;s main point (I&#8217;m told) is to conclude that this effort had failed and we&#8217;d just have to risk falling for <strike>Bonaventur</strike>Anselmian arguments.</p>
<p>The other problem is that &#8220;existence&#8221; is not a characteristic like other characteristics.  &#8220;Pegasus exists&#8221; is not a statement like &#8220;Pegasus flies.&#8221;  The grammatic similarity hides a fundamental difference.  Pegasus can&#8217;t fly without existing.  All statements about mythical or hypothetical entities (including statements which are true by definition including uhm definitions) must be phrased in the form &#8220;if Pegasus were to exist then Pegasus would be a winged horse.&#8221;  A simpler rule, which works just as well, is to require all definitions to be of that form so we can define &#8220;Life&#8221; by &#8220;If life exists it would be the notional trait shared by all things that grow and reproduce&#8221; without expressing a view as to the existence or non existence of at least one living thing.  </p>
<p>Why that works rather well.  Bonaventura would be rewritten as having proven &#8220;If God exists then God exists&#8221;.</p>

                                <p>As I have said repeatedly, we need a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/16/business/16banking.html" target="_blank">a national bank</a>, not bottomless cavities of financial wonder that do nothing more than suck in endless dollars.<br />
<blockquote>“We are down a path that this country has not seen since Andrew Jackson shut down the Second National Bank of the United States,” said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “We are going to go back to a time when the government controlled the banking system.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Citibank and Bank of America are &#8220;buckling&#8221; under. More useless billions will be poured into Bank of America. It&#8217;s time to think outside the cavities. No more fancy rescue tricks.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Instead of investing tens of billions of taxpayer dollars in exchange for preferred shares in the banks, which has been the Treasury Department’s approach so far with its capital infusions, the government essentially liberated the banks from some of their most threatening assets. </p>
<p>The trouble with the new approach, analysts say, is that it is likely to conceal the amount of risk that taxpayers are taking on. If the government-guaranteed securities turn out to be worthless, the cost of the insurance would be much higher than if the Treasury Department had simply bailed out the banks with cash in the first place. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Christopher Whalen, a managing partner at Institutional Risk Analytics, said the approach also covers up the underlying reality that the government is already essentially the majority shareholder in Citigroup. </p>
<p>“There’s nobody else out there to invest in them,” Mr. Whalen said. “We already own them.” </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we own them, run them. But Bernanke, like some junky who never knows when to quit, just keeps on trucking:<br />
<blockquote>Speaking to the London School of Economics, but addressing American audiences as much as European ones, Mr. Bernanke warned that the federal government had no choice but to put more money into banks and other financial institutions if it had any hope of reviving the paralyzed credit markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Choice? There are always choices. Try thinking outside the cavity.</p>
<p>Like a superstitious Easter Islander, Bernanke, through education and training, keeps wasting his wood on more and more stone statues. If this is an example of our best thinking, then we are hopeless.</p>

                                <p>By Spencer</p>
<p>In December industrial production fell 2.0% and manufacturing output fell 2.3% to a level almost 10% below year ago levels .</p>
<p>From a level of 100 at the peak industrial production has now fallen to 92.0, or  roughly at the average trough level for the 10 post WW II recessions of 92.3%.  Three recessions were more severe. In 1958 the peak to trough drop was to 86.6%, in 1974 it was 86.9%, and in 1981-82 it was to 90.7.  Despite all of the improvements in inventory control and other factors behind the great moderation there is little doubt that by the time this recession is over it will have been among the worse post WW II recessions. If you rely on nothing else, the current level of inventories very strongly implies that manufacturing output has yet to bottom.</p>

As a component of the lagging indicator the conference board makes an estimate of monthly manufacturing unit labor cost.  They estimated that in November the six month growth rate at annual rates for manufacturing unit labor cost was at double digit rates.<br />If this is accurate, the spread between falling prices as measured by the PPI and unit labor cost implies that corporate  and/or S&#038;P 500 profit margins  are now falling at post WW II record rates.  Together with sharply falling output and write-offs in the financial sector it clearly looks like the drop in corporate profits and/or S&#038;P 500 earnings will set a post WW II record decline  this cycle.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SXCz6eoJOZI/AAAAAAAAAnI/A_oqQ-GLzIQ/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SXCz6eoJOZI/AAAAAAAAAnI/A_oqQ-GLzIQ/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />One difference this cycle is how small the drop in capacity utilization at the crude level has been.</p>
<p>This stem from the growing role of energy production in the industrial production data as output of other metals and minerals has declined in importance. In todays world the bulk of the drop in domestic energy consumption shows up in falling imports rather than falling output.</p>

Low Cost until 2007 meant fully funded but not overfunded Social Security through the 75 year actuarial window. No matter what had happened in the year before, or even the several years before, the output never varies. In shape anyway, a close look shows that the ultimate Trust Fund Ratios differ, but for operational purposes we get the same result: Baby Bear and porridge just right.</p>

<p>THE CHOICE </p>
<p>The reason for offering this post is that it has become very fashionable among Serious People to propose that raising the retirement age is the &#8220;obvious&#8221; solution to the &#8220;Social Security Crisis.&#8221; </p>
<p>In a recent exchange I accused an otherwise intelligent and decent person of cruelty by stupidity for proposing an increase in the retirement age. </p>
<p>That person replied:</p>
<p>“I think we need to ask that poor old lady who scrubs floors whether she would rather have her payroll tax raised or work one extra year so that she can be retired for three extra years. Would she rather work harder for 40 years or the same for 41? As you said elsewhere, she is going to have to pay for it one way or another. If she is already working two (or three) jobs, she may feel that coberly is the one being cruel.” </p>
<p>I think the reply is incoherent on a number of counts: I cannot see how the old lady is going to be asked to work harder for forty years. Or how working an extra year magically turns into three extra years of retirement. Or why working two or three jobs for an extra year or two or three should be counted as an argument in FAVOR of increasing the retirement age. But what about asking that poor old lady about her choices? </p>
<p>In the first place she would not understand her choices unless someone patiently explained them to her. </p>
<p>More important: she will not be given the choice. It will be made for her by lazy minded intellectuals who have done the aggregate math, without a thought about what it means in human terms. </p>
<p>Here is the choice: </p>
<p>An increase in the payroll tax of twenty dollars per week for the average worker will pay for the projected extra six years of life expectancy. That means each “extra” year of retirement will cost the average worker about three dollars per week. That average worker would be making 1000 dollars per week at the time we are talking about. (The extra payroll tax would cost the low income worker about a dollar and a half.) </p>
<p>Rough check: 3 dollars times 52 equals about 150 dollars <br />  Bosses contribution doubles that to 300 dollars per year <br />  times 40 working years equals about 12,000 dollars <br />  which is a little more than one year of Social Security benefits. </p>
<p>So our intellectual is supposing that given the choice of saving an extra three dollars a week in order to be able to retire one year earlier, the average working person would say, “no thank you. i need the three bucks this week.&#8221; </p>
<p>This might well be what a poor person would say at the age of twenty. It is most definitely not what she would say at the age of 60. </p>
<p>The very intelligent and decent people who are going to decide this question forget several things: </p>
<p>The old lady is paying for her own retirement. Not “the government”. </p>
<p>The average life expectancy will not be the same as the actual life span of any particular individual. If the average span increases by six years, something like ten percent of the people will still die in the first year. In the traces, if our “on the average” experts have their way. </p>
<p>No one knows for sure that the average life expectency WILL rise. Nor that if it does, peple will remain healthy and &#8220;young&#8221; enough to work. Think about 70 year old saw mill workers, or policemen&#8230;.or school teachers&#8230; or your boss. </p>
<p>No one who has a job he likes can imagine the hell people face who have the jobs that poor people have. </p>
<p>No well off person can say what a poor person should be allowed to do with the last few years of her life if she has paid for the costs of retirement. She may want to see her grandchildren, or write a book, or just live life for herself for a few years instead of having to make money just to survive. </p>
<p>If thepeople can save enough of their own money over 40 years, and will, if given the chance, pay for the full 20 years of post-retirement life expectancy, why should some &#8220;non partisan expert&#8221; say, “No. You can’t do that. We have determined that it is against God’s law for poor people to be allowed to pay for their own retirement. Retirement is a privilege of the rich.&#8221; </p>
<p>Because some clever intellectual has had the brilliant thought “Gee, we could count backward from average life expectancy to determine a “fair” retirement age. And that will save the worker 3 dollars a week for every year he is not allowed to retire.&#8221;<br />___________________________________<br />by reader coberly</p>

<p>Dean Baker on Autoworkers Pay&#8230; Plus Helping Banks</p>
<p>One flaw in this blog, if you ask me, is that we don&#8217;t link to Dean Baker enough.  He generally covers a lot of material in a short amount of space, and is right more often than he&#8217;s wrong.  So if y&#8217;all keep your mouths shut, I&#8217;m just gonna <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=differences_in_executive_compe#comments">steal one of his posts, outright</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>The Washington Post has repeatedly editorialized that auto workers at the Big Three companies should be forced to take pay cuts because they earn $57,000 a year, which is more than workers get at the foreign-owned plants in the United States. Consistent with this editorial position, the paper has <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=differences_in_executive_compe#comments">an article today</a> about efforts to lower the compensation packages of union workers.</p>
<p>The Post has virtually ignored the much larger gap between executive compensation at the Big Three and at the transplants. While top executives at Japanese manufacturers like Toyota only earn around $2 million a year, executives at the Big Three can earn 10 times this amount.This would seem to be a reasonable focus for those concerned about making the U.S. industry competitive.</p></blockquote>
<p>And since I&#8217;m blatantly ripping him off in this post, I had been planning on taking <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=the_money_to_save_homeowners_i">this one</a> earlier in the week:</p>
<blockquote><p>NPR reported on Representative Barney Frank&#8217;s effort to ensure that a substantial portion of the money from the second $350 billion in the TARP go toward helping homeowners. The proposals that purport to save homeowners would in fact hand large amounts of money to banks. They involve paying banks far above market prices for underwater mortgages. The benefit to homeowners is that they would be allowed to stay in their homes, possibly with zero equity. (Some proposals also give the homeowner a small equity cushion.)</p>
<p>NPR and other news outlets should be reporting who gets the money under these proposals. In many cases, banks may be paid tens of thousands of dollars to leave a homeowner in a home in which they have no equity. At a time when Congress is debating extending the State Children&#8217;s Health Insurance Program at a cost of $3,000 per kid, it is not clear how many kids&#8217; health care they or the public would be willing to sacrifice to pay a bank to leave someone in a home in which they have no equity.</p></blockquote>
