<p>[This is an important post. Please read the bit after my comment and please do respond/critique in the comments.]</p>
<p>Angrybear has a post on the TVA fuckup (a retaining wall collapsed, letting loose a huge flood of flyash &#8212; the stuff left after burning coal &#8212; that buried houses, killed people AND left a huge environmental mess).</p>
<p>I left this comment:</p>
<p>    TVA, like most utilities (public and private), has low incentives to maintain capital stock. Spending leads to hearings over rate increases, lowers cash flow that bond buyers like to see (as noted), and reduces &#8220;performance&#8221;-related bonuses.</p>
<p>    Ex-post clean up and rate increases are always easier to justify (they MUST occur), and they are counted as special items &#8212; accidents that are not the CEO&#8217;s fault.</p>
<p>    The most important factor is that TVA, like other monopolistic utilities, will not go out of business for making such a stupid move (compare that to how asbestos companies got treated).</p>
<p>    I am betting that TVA will also get gov&#8217;t aid since it, like Fannie Mae, has a &#8220;privatize profits, socialize losses&#8221; incentive structure.</p>
<p>    The only One way to prevent a future occurrence is to put people in jail since fines would be paid by rateholders anyway. The problem with that is that future execs &#8212; everywhere &#8212; would gold-plate everything [i.e., build capital stock to such a high (and expensive) standard that nothing would ever fail].</p>
<p>    Another way to do that is to prohibit self-insurance against environmental damage. Instead have independent companies insure against risk, which will mean that they will also monitor the monopoly. (Insurance against water shortages would make it more likely that water rates would stay in the &#8220;right&#8221; range. Hmmm..)</p>
<p>So that last comment got me to thinking.</p>
<p>The problem with monopolies is that they don&#8217;t face competition. On way to make them compete is by rewarding/punishing those that preform better/worse than a benchmark.</p>
<p>Another way is to chip away at the monopoly by subjecting &#8220;business lines&#8221; to competition (as the USPS was forced to do with packages and water utilities are involuntarily experiencing with bottled water).</p>
<p>A third way would force the monopoly to purchase from a competitive market at prices that would fall if they were well-run and rise if their operations were shoddy (e.g., TVA). So my new idea is this: Require that water monopolies (private and public) purchase insurance against outages, shortages, toxic spills, etc. Such a requirement would produce two good results:</p>
<p>   1. Current practices would immediately improve with oversight &#8212; solving the free-rider/coordination problem (in principal-agent jargon) of monitoring utilities.<br />   2. Insurance companies would pay for future problems, which reduces the problem with ex-post rate increases to fix them. </p>
<p>Current water rates would rise, but future rates would not spike, so rates would be actuarially identical over the long run.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: Sometimes we must have monopolies; that doesn&#8217;t mean they should be badly-run.</p>
<p>Addendum: Kevin Dick had a great idea (use prediction markets) in the comments. I had assumed that monopolies&#8217; insurance rates would be made public, but prediction markets would allow outsiders to bet if the rates were right or wrong. SUPER!</p>
<p>Addendum 2: It would cost $1-5 billion/year to bring coal waste sites (ponds and landfills) up to EPA specs. That&#8217;s disaster (or profit!) waiting to happen. </p>

<p>Via <a href="http://www.trafficworld.com/newssection/government.asp?id=49276">TrafficWorld</a>:<br />
<blockquote>According to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, 50 percent of funds provided to states will be required to be obligated within 90 days. </p>
<p>Within 180 days of enactment, states must submit a program of projects outlining how the remaining 50 percent of the projects will be obligated within one year of enactment, according to the committee&#8217;s proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the face of it, this looks good for projects that are in advanced stages of planning but not quite spade-ready — which may answer how to quickly obligate big bucks (by U.S. standards) for transit, passenger rail, and other projects more complicated than road repairs.  It also suggests that the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/infrastructure-stimulus-amounts.html">$85 billion amount being floated</a> is an amount to be obligated in one calendar year rather than two (or the next one-and-a-half fiscal years).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, John Boehner rounded up his merry band of <a href="http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=108190">economists against the stimulus</a>.  When the <a href="http://republicanleader.house.gov/UploadedFiles/stimulusskeptics.pdf">#2 commenter</a> on the (rather low-wattage*) list of skeptics is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=luskin+stupidest+man+alive">Donald Luskin</a>, you&#8217;re in trouble.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>* And as a low-wattage economist myself, I use the term advisedly.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb<br />What does it take? A stake through the heart? A bullet through the brain? Baker and Krugman do some pushback.<br />Dean Baker in his post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=01&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=the_posts_jihad_against_social">The Post&#8217;s Jihad against Social Security</a> points to this article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/06/AR2009010602849.html">Obama Predicts Years of Deficits over $1 trillion</a> and notes that they don&#8217;t hesitate to single out the usual suspect. Is it the cost of the war? The cost of the bailout? The cost of the stimulus package? Nope apparently those are just short term problems. Instead as always the first stop for deficit reform is Social Security.<br />
<blockquote>WaPo: The mounting debt has raised an alarm on Capitol Hill, where some Republicans and moderate Democrats are pressing Obama to tackle the looming challenge of skyrocketing Medicare and Social Security spending, and to adopt tough new budget rules to prevent future deficits from ballooning.</p></blockquote>
<p> Which leads Dean to reply with some exasperation:<br />
<blockquote>The article includes a comment about &#8220;the looming challenge of skyrocketing Medicare and Social Security spending. &#8221; Of course Social Security spending is not projected to skyrocket. It is projected to increase gradually, and its costs are fully covered by its own tax stream until 2048, according to the Congressional Budget Office&#8217;s latest projections.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a related note Paul Krugman poses the question in a Jan 5 post <a target="_blank" href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/a-bullet-dodged/">A Bullet Dodged</a><br />
<blockquote>What would have happened if George W. Bush had actually succeeded in his plan to privatize Social Security?</p></blockquote>
<p> and suggests an answer &#8216;Ask the Italians&#8217; <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&#038;sid=aty4gEh9wups&#038;refer=home">Bloomberg News: Italian Pensions Sapped by Private Funds Bush Backed</a></p>
<p>In my view it is practically criminal for policy makers to be wasting a second talking about Social Security given the very real possiblity we are headed for a new Great Depression. And so equally criminal for opinion makers to be twisting current events to pursue this old vendetta. It is a shame that people like Baker and Krugman still have to keep a vigilant eye out for the zombies intent on eating the flesh of Social Security. Maybe we can make a deal. If the Right will simply stop taking every possible opportunity to take a bite at Social Security then I promise to shut up. And then maybe we can let Krugman and Baker continue the really important discussion.</p>

<p>A Look at What the Next President&#8217;s Chief Economic Advisor Wrote About Tax Policy</p>
<p>Since Christina Romer is gonna be Obama&#8217;s Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, its worth revisiting her work.  Now, I&#8217;m not an academic, so I don&#8217;t read all that many papers.  But I remember reading the March 2007 <a target="_blank" href="http://www.econ.berkeley.edu/~cromer/RomerDraft307.pdf">Romer and Romer</a> paper as it made quite a spash at the time.  (There&#8217;s a Nov 2008 <a target="_blank" href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/draft1108.pdf">update</a> of the paper up now, but a quick skim indicates it doesn&#8217;t seem to address the problem I have with the paper which I&#8217;ll be getting to in a moment.)</p>
<p>The paper finds that at least some tax increases are highly contractionary.  Now, when I read a paper with an empirical component, I pay extra attention to the data used in the analysis.  Especially if the results contradict my intuition, and even more so if the results don&#8217;t match what I myself have found.  Sometimes, I learn I was wrong.  Sometimes I learn I wasn&#8217;t.  Either way, looking at the data teaches me something important.</p>
<p>Now, I hesitate to criticize, because Romer and Romer are very accomplished individuals, and I am, quite frankly, a nobody who has gotten into a lot of trouble a few times for questioning my betters.  But sometimes my curiosity gets the better of me, and in this instance, the first sign of trouble, to me, is the fact that the paper doesn&#8217;t actually provide the data &#8211; instead, it makes reference to a narrative record.  And this graph (insert figure please!)<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SWWWdhqxlvI/AAAAAAAAADI/7prOz-UKBFo/s1600-h/Romer_1a.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SWWWdhqxlvI/AAAAAAAAADI/7prOz-UKBFo/s320/Romer_1a.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a> has a few data points that just don&#8217;t match my recollection.  If you want to play along at home, I suggest you start with the most recent change in the figure.  Anyone remember the great tax hike of 2005?  In the graph, it is bigger than the tax increase in 1993 which most of us do remember, and its a lot more recent, so it should be right there, in the forefront of your brain, right?  Well, to be honest, I don&#8217;t remember the great tax hike of 2005 either.</p>
<p>So its off to see the <strike>wizard</strike> narrative record which hopefully will clear up the mystery of the great tax hike of 2005.   And Christina Romer&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/index.shtml">website at Berkeley</a> does have a November 2008 version of the &#8220;narrative record&#8221; up, so I took me a gander.  It seems a large part of the effect of a law, according to this narrative record, is what the President and the Congress told us it would be around the time the law was passed or the policy was implemented.  Well, I got news for the Romers &#8211; by that standard, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">the national debt has been plummeting since GW took office</a>.  And as I recall, the magic of the Laffer curve was supposed to make Reagan look fiscally responsible too.</p>
<p>But back to the great tax hike of 2005.    2005Q1 seems to be, according to Romer and Romer, an effect of the 2003 Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.  And while they assign that act a big reduction in liabilities in 2003 (i.e., a tax cut), they assign it an increase in liabilities in 2005.  (i.e., A tax hike.  Read the thing yourself &#8211; its on page 88.)  With all due respect, this, to me, is gobbledygook.  One can assign all sorts of things to all sorts of things, but here&#8217;s the way I would approach 2005:  there were no changes to the marginal income tax rates or the capital gains rates between 2003 and the present, so there were no marginal tax rate changes in 2005.  I believe the estate tax fell a bit as a result of the earlier in the decade GW Hearts Paris Hilton and Himself Act of 2001&#8230; and will continue falling until it hits zero in 2010.  But as far as I know, the only &#8220;major&#8221; new piece of legislation to hit in 2005 was the &#8220;American Jobs Creation Act of 2004.&#8221;   That was a tax cut, pure and simple &#8211; the more closely the title of a law hews to &#8220;Mom and Apple Pie&#8221; the less taxes someone is gonna be paying and faster debt is gonna pile up on future generations&#8217; tab.</p>
<p>Going back a bit further, the narrative points to a tax hike in 1982.  Big sucker too! (Check out the graph again.)  Once again, the Romer and Romer narrative doesn&#8217;t fit with how I remember things.  I remember the bottom marginal income tax rate dropping from 14% to 12% from 81 to 82, and again to 11% in 83.  As I remember things, the top marginal rate going from 69% in 81 to 50% in 82, and the top cap gains tax dropping from 35.6% to 27.3% to 27% from 81 to 82 to 83.   In terms of GDP, tax collections also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/sheets/hist01z3.xls">fell substantially</a>, going from 19.6% in 1981 to 19.1% in 1982 to 17.5% in 1983 and even a smidge further down in 1984.  </p>
<p>Now, Romer and Romer go on to tell us a lot about this tax increase (E.g.,  &#8220;The motivation for this tax increase was deficit reduction and fairness.  The fiscal action was clearly not taken because policymakers felt the economy was overheating.&#8221;) but to me it reads like so much verisimilitude.  Whether there were bones thrown to the concept of fiscal responsibility, and regardless of whatever our esteemed leaders were peddling when they sold this thing to the public, the simple fact of the matter remains:  1982 and 1983 were tax cut years.  Romer and Romer can tell me taxes were hiked all they want, but I&#8217;m also free to go around saying the Loch Ness Monster was stealing lollipops from children in Central Park at the time.  The fact is, nobody remembers either episode because neither one happened.  (And to forestall one line of BS I expect to otherwise see in comments:  reducing an anticipated tax cut of X% to Y%, where Y = X &#8211; epsilon, does not make for a tax hike.)  </p>
<p>Anyway, I can go on, but I think its obvious that either I&#8217;ve completely misread these two papers, or there&#8217;s something seriously wrong with the data that went the work.  I would also add that with the &#8220;right&#8221; data I can prove the earth is flat, not to mention that the Loch Ness Monster has a thing for lollipops.  Furthermore, Christina Romer will be advising the next President (preview:  tax cuts are the shiznit) so let&#8217;s hope we can chalk this up to a major misunderstanding on my part.  But I&#8217;m kinda worried the problem isn&#8217;t that I&#8217;m displaying some latent feeble-mindedness &#8211;  Greg Mankiw thinks Christina Romer is <a target="_blank" href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/11/christy-romer-to-cea.html">&#8220;an excellent choice.&#8221;</a><br />__________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>Gail the Actuary on the OilDrum <a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4915#more" target="_blank">presents</a> a thoughtful, well-organized piece on economic prospects for 2009. She outlines levels of debt resting on actual income. The economic outlook is not rosy. Below is her opening figure:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SWPAlY5xvvI/AAAAAAAAADg/XM8KAuKI6IU/s1600-h/Tower+of+Debt.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SWPAlY5xvvI/AAAAAAAAADg/XM8KAuKI6IU/s400/Tower+of+Debt.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>She points out that<br />
<blockquote>It is only when the system is under stress, and shortfalls in income of the ordinary citizen start shaking the system, that these connections becomes clearer.</p></blockquote>
<p>She notes that there are &#8220;many feedback loops&#8221; in the tower.<br />
<blockquote>When things are very good, the feedback loops tend to make things look very, very good (higher wages-> higher spending -> profitable businesses -> more hiring -> rising home prices -> less need for government programs). These same feedback loops work the opposite direction when things are bad (layoffs, for example), making a bad economic scenario truly terrible. The huge tower is also expensive to maintain, and takes resources from productive uses, like building infrastructure and new factories. As more and more layers are added to the tower (like TARP), the tower becomes more and more unstable, and more and more likely to have big reactions to small events.</p></blockquote>
<p>To drive her point home, she presents the following graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SWPBBzG0BQI/AAAAAAAAADo/SyfE8w3-4hE/s1600-h/Why_Households+Arent+Buying.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SWPBBzG0BQI/AAAAAAAAADo/SyfE8w3-4hE/s400/Why_Households+Arent+Buying.jpg" border="0"></a></p>
<p>I would add one graph of my own:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SWPBSjiBCcI/AAAAAAAAADw/nUcIV-v5klo/s1600-h/Balance+on+Current+Account+as+Percentage.gif"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SWPBSjiBCcI/AAAAAAAAADw/nUcIV-v5klo/s400/Balance+on+Current+Account+as+Percentage.gif" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Unless root causes, not symptoms, are addressed, then there is little hope that the future will be very bright. We move blindly from one crisis to another, trying to staunch the latest wound with another expensive band-aid. </p>
<p>We have become incapable of holding more than one idea at a time. </p>
<p>Does the lobby wheel cater only to special interests that have led us into the health care morass and other disasters as well? Will the vulture-lobbyists-politicians be there to guide the latest stimulus package? You betcha. But forget about them. We need the stimulus package.</p>
<p>Have banks refused to loosen up credit after being given loads of money? You betcha. But forget about them. We failed there. Let&#8217;s try something else. Bring on the latest stimulus package. </p>
<p>Is our trade deficit and current account balance dangerous? You betcha. Forget about that. We need the stimulus package. Besides, only a handful of economists&#8211;Peter Morici among others&#8211;have complained. We should be glad we are getting cheap goods. Well, to keep its export machine going, Asia will certainly do its best to make that export machine alive. Goods will be even cheaper. Deflation is on the prowl. </p>
<p>Are the massive and dangerous trade imbalances a result Asian currency manipulation, export tax rebates, cheap labor&#8211;and a flood of FDI into these countries trying to cash in on the export machine to the U.S. You betcha. But forget about all that. Get the stimulus package going. We can&#8217;t let their export machines collapse. Globalization, as structured, needs to be rescued.</p>
<p>Always the latest crisis; always the latest short-term solution. Is there any vision? Hardly. We are watching a parade of the thoughtless, the foolish, and the dangerous. </p>
<p>I am reminded of Eugène Ionesco&#8217;s <i>Rhinoceros</i> where crowds of people morph into dangerous, thoughtless rhinos, blindly following each other in one rampage after another. </p>
<p>And where were the economists, even those we most admire?</p>
<p>With Nouriel Roubini at the academic helm, a year ago the World Economic Forum issued its 2008 Financial Development Report. Guess what? <em><strong>The U.S. was rated number 1 in financial sophistication and maturity.</strong></em> </p>
<p>Talk about squaring the circle! The <a href="http://www.weforum.org/pdf/FinancialDevelopmentReport/2008.pdf" target="_blank">link</a> to this report has been put on this site a number of times. (I did once or twice; Movie Guy did once.) You can lead a rhino to water&#8230;.</p>
<p>One year later, we are on the verge of the next Great Depression, so says Krugman&#8230;and I agree. Did the economists for that Financial Development report take a vote, after polling numerous well-heeled CEO&#8217;s and fellow economists? Damned if I know. </p>
<p>But consider all the glowing predictions and all the glowing congratulations that have been made and offered in the past six years. The world is on the path to a new millennium, the hey-day of free trade as orchestrated by the WTO and the globalization zealots, who cared not a whit that global imbalances were growing ever more precarious. It will all right itself in the end, they said. Just keep the party going. </p>
<p>Gail sets her grim picture against resource depletion as world population increases. I depair of even thinking about that problem, along with that nameless other (global warming. Forget I even mentioned it.)</p>

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0106/p25s04-wome.html">Symbolism Writ Large</a>, in a manner to shame <a target="_blank" href="http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/">Christo</a> himself:<br />
<blockquote>US opens world&#8217;s largest foreign mission in Iraq</p>
<p>The $592 million, 104-acre compound that was dedicated in Baghdad&#8217;s fortified Green Zone on Monday is meant to symbolize a long-term commitment to Iraq. </p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of &#8220;symbolizing.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Tell me again why we need to be cautious in investing in domestic infrastructure. (Yes, I get that it&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/infrastructure-stimulus-amounts.html">incrementally larger</a>. So was the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aid_Highway_Act_of_1956">Federal-Aid Highway Transportation Act of 1956</a>. Nu?)</p>
<p>*Since Rick Warren was the driving force behind the PEPFAR initiative, discussed by cactus <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/12/bush-as-great-man-new-meme.html">here</a>, response for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oew-clement21feb21,0,3690830.story">tens of thousands of African illnesses and deaths</a>, and so discredited that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1201/p04s01-woaf.html">even popular television shows</a> are lambasting it, the idea that he will Just Go Away on 20 January 2009 around 2:00pm is even more absurd than usual.</p>

<p>Around election time, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee had identified $45 billion in ready-to-go infrastructure projects a stimulus package.  Now <a href="http://www.trafficworld.com/newssection/government.asp?id=49234">TrafficWorld reports</a> that the Committee now is looking at $85 billion:<br />
<blockquote>The recommendations, outlined in a Dec. 12 memo, include $30 billion for highways and bridges, $12 billion for transit, $4.9 billion for passenger rail, $5 billion for airports, $14.3 billion for environmental infrastructure, $7 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and $10 billion for federal buildings, according to the committee.</p></blockquote>
<p>To put this amount in perspective, under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAFETEA-LU">SAFETEA-LU</a>, the highway and transit funding bill in effect through FY09, federal highway and transit expenditures run around $60 billion/year ($284 billion for FY05-FY09), so $42 billion on highways and transit is a pretty big increment.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that $100 billion/year is necessarily a large amount of money to spend in the less-short term, especially if we want things like vastly improved transit and passenger rail systems and considering some of the things $100B/year were spent on during the Bush administration.  Politically, it seems to me that it would be better to fund the medium-term projects outside the stimulus package in a FY10+ infrastructure bill to follow SAFETEA-LU, which just so happens to be due this year.  If the projects are valuable — and many are or will be — then then they should not be funded only in case of economic emergency.</p>

<p>is amazed at the reaction of leading figures in the left blogiverse to the W$J&#8217;s &#8220;news&#8221; that there will be tax cuts as part of the stimulus.  See <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Americablog/~3/2kCzoJFbdyk/bush-obama-now-talking-300-bn-in-tax.html">Aravosis</a>, <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/stimulating-debate-by-digby-democrats.html">Digby</a>, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/is-obama-relying-too-much-on-tax-cuts/">Krugman</a>, <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Talking-Points-Memo/~3/bwuTLArZFec/collaborative_j.php">Marshall</a>.</p>
<p>Can we cancel the circular firing squad?</p>
<p>As far as I can tell from the Journal&#8217;s reporting, the main tax elements are largely indistinguishable from what Obama was promoting in the fall.  Here, for instance, is a snippet of the <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/10/debate-transcri.html">third debate</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[Bob Schieffer:] Senator Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs&#8230;</p>
<p>[TB Note: The $60 billion mentioned by Schieffer is an annual figure, while the $300B reported by the W$J is over two years.]</p>
<p>[Sen. Obama:] Number one, let&#8217;s focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that&#8217;s creating a job right here in America.</p>
<p>Number two, let&#8217;s help families right away by providing them a tax cut &#8212; a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let&#8217;s allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they&#8217;re experiencing a crisis. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now Prof. Krugman&#8217;s analysis actually is pretty solid on the economics of stimulating via a combination of tax cuts and public expenditures, and he seems to detect the underlying politics.  That is, use a spoonful of tax cuts that the Obama camp was going to push anyway to peel off enough Republican votes to advance a lot of stuff that the Senate Republicans&#8217; paleolithic caucus won&#8217;t like (and, let&#8217;s face it, can&#8217;t stop, whatever Mitch McConnell might say about wanting to lend rather than grant money to the states and such).  If the &#8216;carrot&#8217; approach is followed by capitulation rather than by aggressive pressure to promote the plan a la Obama, then the political observers may have something to gripe about.</p>
<p>On the economics, I don&#8217;t especially care for the business tax cut components, which in the absence of a general loophole-closure program I&#8217;d expect would as likely as not stimulate the tax law sector of the economy while the Tax Foundation still gets to gripe about high statutory corporate rates.  And it&#8217;s a matter both of Our Stupid Discourse and government accounting methods that fail to distinguish between government consumption and investment spending that tax cuts are less controversial than appropriately targeted spending.  But anyone who&#8217;s surprised by this part of the stimulus package wasn&#8217;t paying attention during the campaign.</p>

<div>The End of the Recession: A Prediction</div>
<div></div>
<div>Back in March, I noted we were in recession, and that the recession was somewhat different from previous recessions in that it <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20href=" com="" html="">had not been preceded</a> by a nice sized cut in the real money supply.  Put another way &#8211; an error by the Fed wasn&#8217;t the immediate cause of this recession.</div>
<div></div>
<div>While the money supply is usually what precipitates a recession, the face of a recession, so to speak, are job losses.  The economy slows down, less stuff gets made and bought, and people lose their jobs.  Sometimes these job losses continue for a while after the recession ends (think the 2001 recession), but generally, the end of the recession and the end of the job losses tend to come at more or less the same point.</div>
<div></div>
<div>All this is prologue for me going out on a limb:  I think the end of the recession is coming sooner rather than later.  Specifically, I expect it before the second half of next year.  I&#8217;m actually hedging my bets here &#8211; my gut tells me that it will come before the second quarter of next year.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Here&#8217;s why&#8230;  I pulled <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20target=">monthly employment to population ratio figures</a> from FRED, the invaluable database maintained by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Data goes back to the murky depths of pre-history, specifically January 1948.  Consider all ten previous recessions that have occurred since 1948 and before the current mess.  If you look at the average reduction in the employment to population ratio from the high point within the twelve months preceding a recession and the end of a recession, you get a figure of 1.8.  By contrast, the high point in the twelve months leading up the recession that began in December of 07 came in December of 06 &#8211; and employment to population ratio of 63.4%.  November figures were at 61.4, so there&#8217;s already been a drop of 2, a bit higher than the average.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, the employment to population ratio happens to be higher now than ever before, so a drop of 2 is easier to achieve.  However, the percentage drop of 3.15% also exceeds the average percentage drop (3.11%) observed in previous recessions.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, I wouldn&#8217;t be a good economist if I didn&#8217;t leave myself some ways to weasel out of my prediction, so here they go.   First is that this assumes the current recession behaves a bit like previous recessions.  As I noted back in March, this one seems to be different from the previous ones we&#8217;ve seen as it didn&#8217;t arise from the Fed inadvertently choking off the economy.   If you ask me, the current situation is most similar to the 87 &#8211; 91 mess, which came when excessive financial deregulation led to the S&#038;L crisis, which in turn only officially became a recession in Nov 90 and lasted through March of 91.  To a large extent, even if it wasn&#8217;t all a recession, that mess went on for four years or so.  Things are happening more quickly here.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Another issue is the difficulty in predicting the behavior of the big players, especially the Fed and the Federal Government.  So far, as far as I can tell, they&#8217;ve just made things worse.  Much worse.  Both seem to be doing their best to ensure that the financial sector continues to be unstable by keeping the lousiest banks afloat  &#8211; and who wants to deal with a lousy bank knowing that unless you&#8217;re one of the favored few, if there&#8217;s a bad to hold you&#8217;re the one whose gonna be doing the holding.  And there&#8217;s no guarantee that the next President isn&#8217;t going to do some really <a href="http://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20target=">stupid things</a>too.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, here&#8217;s the final issue&#8230; this is kinda numerology.  After all, I don&#8217;t really have fundamental reasons why job losses won&#8217;t continue to accelerate for the next year.  But that said, and maybe I&#8217;m missing something, I don&#8217;t see any particular reason why things will be so much worse than, say, 1973-1975.  Sure, there are some structural changes that need to be made to the economy, but learning to live without Goldman&#8217;s financial crack pipe can&#8217;t possibly be as difficult as learning to live with OPEC squeezing our collective testicles.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>BTW &#8211; the data and the analysis are <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILh9YfE58a4VUQ">here.</a></div>
