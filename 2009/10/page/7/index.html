<p>has definitely not been spending enough time in bars.  Nation food correspondent Calvin Trillin met a guy in a bar who explained why the financial system collapsed.<br />I nominate some guy in a bar for the Nobel memorial prize in economics.</p>
<p>The explanation ?  “The financial system nearly collapsed,” he said, “because smart guys had started working on Wall Street.” </p>
<p>Proof beyond reasonable doubt <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/opinion/14trillin.html?_r=1&#038;em">here</a> (via <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2009/10/tab_dump_91.html">Ezra Klein</a> who also sent me to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P9dpTTpjymE">this video </a>which is why I am <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/">here</a> and which shows that when they put their minds to it, smart guys can do other things than destroy financial systems).</p>

<p>Doug Elmendorf says that the costs of cap and trade will be miniscule and does not try to estimate the benefits. Juliet Eilperin of the Washington Post demonstrates that she is the second most innumerate person on the planat, the most innumerate is the** guy who wrote the headline <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/10/14/AR2009101404054.html?hpid%3Dmoreheadlines&#038;sub=AR">&#8220;Cap-and-Trade Would Slow Economy, CBO Chief Says&#8221;</a></p>
<p>The headline supposed to be justified by </p>
<blockquote><p>Elmendorf testified before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that the cap-and-trade provisions of the House bill &#8212; in which emitters of greenhouse gases would be able to buy and sell pollution credits &#8212; would cut the nation&#8217;s gross domestic product by 0.25 to 0.75 percent in 2020 compared with &#8220;what it would otherwise have been,&#8221; and by 1 to 3.5 percent in 2050.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now the standard way of describing GDP growth is the annual rate. As the cost of health insurance subsidies and medicaid advantage is the 10 year cost not the yearly cost, so the effect of cap and trade on growth is the effect after 10 years or 40 years not the effect on the growth rate.  Elperin doesn&#8217;t say when the CBO assumes cap and trade will be introduced (the bill they scored did but I haven&#8217;t read it relying as I do on newspapers to report the news).  I guess it would start in 2010, so Elmendorf said the growth rate of GDP would be reduced by 0.025 % to 0.075 %percent for ten years and 0.025 % to 0.0875 % percent for 40 years.  </p>
<p>These are tiny tiny numbers compared to the average growth rate and compared to the standard deviation of the annual growth rate and compared to anything.</p>
<p>In a standard Solow type growth model with perfect competition and no spillovers, you can&#8217;t get something for nothing.  The CBO calculates that we will get a cooler climate for as close to nothing as the result of any such calculation has ever been.</p>
<p>But numbers don&#8217;t matter at the Washington Post &#8212; they only care about the sign of the number which follows directly and immediately from standard (and false) assumptions.</p>
<p>Scheduled flight WP0085* lowered it&#8217;s cruising speed from 600 to 599.975 mph and therefore stalled, crashed and burned.</p>
<p>*The flight number 85 is not to be interpreted as extremely rude and unfounded speculation about anyone&#8217;s IQ.</p>
<p>** update: typo corrected.</p>
<p>Letters matter too.  The calculation is of GDP.  We might care more about GNP.  Other things equal GNP -GDP will be reduced by the interest on the money we send overseas to buy petroleum.  This is not a miniscule sum.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.indexmundi.com/trade/imports/?division=33">in 2005 US oil imports were around $ 200 billion.</a>  Ignore the fact that US petroleum production will decline and assume that the relative price of petroleum will be equal to that in 2005.  That is, very roughly, 1.4% of GNP.  Over 10 years the cumulated value of petroleum imports will amount to very very roughly 13% of GNP (here I assume we pay interest lower than the growth rate of GNP as foreign suckers buy T-bills).  According to the CBO, cap and trade would cause higher GNP in 2020 if we pay 2% on the debt, that cuts 0.026 % of GDP from GNP-GDP.  </p>
<p>With totally absurd assumptions about how little we will import and how cheap it will be and that foreign suckers will keep loaning to us at low rates, I get a cost of interest on petroleum imports of the same order as the estimated effect of cap and trade on GDP.  With semi realistic assumptions about the volume of imports and the relative price of petroleum (note the dollar value of imports roughly doubled from 2000 to 2005) I can easily get that cap and trade will pay for itself if it significantly reduces importation of petroleum.</p>
<p>That is not counting the value of coal still in the ground let alone the value of reduced global warming which is, you know, the point of the whole exercize.</p>
<p>update:  Coal still in the ground.  GNP and GDP count the value added by mining as the value of the product, not the value added by digging it up.  This is a measurement error.  US coal production is about half a billion tons.  The price differs *a lot* depending on quality and bounces around a lot, but is roughly around maybe $ 40/ ton so coal &#8220;production&#8221; is about 0.15% of GDP (why can&#8217;t I find this number on the web).  Just guessing really, I&#8217;d say that amounts to measurement error of well over 0.1% of GDP (0.1% corresonds to say that one third of the value of coal is created by digging it up which is absurdly high).  OK so measurement error in coal mining value added is smaller than the effect of cap and trade on measured GDP.  The reduction in the over estimate of production is only about 10% of the estimated reduction in measured production.  </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I once spent a couple of weeks asking myself, &#8220;How can a nation, or even just a city, cheaply deal with a scarcity of food for the poor, together with a plenitude of cheapbad food (whether fast or home-made) which harms ones health?&#8221;  I came up with the Streetfood Initiative (still in planning, I am sorry to say.)</p>
<p>Up here in the great white north we have plenty of poorly fed, obese, and diabetic people.  We&#8217;re good &#8212; but not perfect.  Our local food bank alone fed about 36,000 people four years ago when I last looked up the data, and the numbers have risen since then.</p>
<p>I proposed that a network of carts and tiny kiosks be set up to give away Streetfood to anyone who asks.</p>
<p>It would not infringe on the fast food industry because it would not be the sort of addictive mix of fat-sugar-salt-starch that they specialize in.  All offerings would be vegetarian, though spicy and nutritionally balanced.  Rice, lentils, curry, stews, and stir-fry type recipes, each serving handed over in an edible container, like a hollowed breadroll or a unsweetened ice cream cone type cup, using a minimum of wrapping.  Recipes would be public, on the net, and available at the cart for the asking.<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MSuZ1riS9qU/StYxUvwwPMI/AAAAAAAAAXI/6A9RoL3dq_g/s1600-h/bread+bowl+bean+stew.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_MSuZ1riS9qU/StYxUvwwPMI/AAAAAAAAAXI/6A9RoL3dq_g/s320/bread+bowl+bean+stew.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The carts and kiosks would be funded through general revenue, with the understanding that savings and benefits would show up elsewhere:  less diabetes, better performance in the schools, fewer malnourished drunks taking up hospital beds, fewer proud starving seniors, and so on.</p>
<p>How much rice, lentils and beans can you buy for what it costs to care for one blind, amputee diabetic?  Lots and lots, I bet.</p>
<p>Another effect I hoped for (perhaps the core effect) would be to alter people&#8217;s ideas of what &#8220;food&#8221; is.</p>
<p>We generally consider the food we grew up with to be real food, and stuff encountered later as foreign, peculiar or even non-food.  Diet is partly choice, true &#8212; but much of what we consider choice comes down to imprinting.</p>
<p>Jared Diamon, in his book &#8220;Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed&#8221;: wrote about why the Norse settlements on Greenland failed. He said<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Looking back on these settlements from our vantage point today, we can observe that the Norse were imperceptibly following practices which weren’t sustainable in their environment in Greenland. These practices were as follows:<br />•Chopped down forests to use wood for fuel, furniture and houses<br />•Used cleared land for grazing cows<br />•Built houses out of 6-foot slabs of turf which meant a home consumed about 10 acres of grassland<br />These practices weren’t sustainable&#8230; Looking back the Norse Greenlanders should have learned from the Inuit to hunt seals as the most reliable food source in winter. But they preferred beef and didn’t like seal. The Norse also should have eaten fish. If they had, they may have survived.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I consider canned mushroom soup to be a staple, along with bananas, potato chips, and frozen pizza.  My grandmother, born in the late 1800s, most likely would never have seen these when she was growing up.</p>
<p>But what if a generation of children grew up eating delicious street food?  Presented correctly, it could become the circus and state-fair finger food for a whole population of youngsters, and help introduce people to a diet that doesn&#8217;t subvert their health.</p>
<p>As for the free rider problem &#8212; bring &#8217;em on.  In an inversion of the old saw, we could be a culture where &#8220;the wealthy, as well as the poor, are permitted to eat Streetfood all they wish.&#8221;</p>
<p>Up here, a person generally has to be below 37% of our poverty line before they will go to a food bank.  People who need the food still won&#8217;t go until truly desperate.  I think the potential for free riders is less than one might imagine, and meanwhile &#8212; they will learn different tastes.</p>

<p>I live in a city of with less than a quarter million people.  (The greater metropolitan area is larger, of course &#8211; there are well over half a million people in the surrounding area.)  Since we moved here a year and change ago, its hard to avoid noticing that in this city, politics is a tough sport.  The mayor apparently has a pretty strong machine going, and that&#8217;s generated a lot of opposition &#8211; there was even a recall election last year though the mayor survived.</p>
<p>There were elections for the city council over a month ago.  At the time of the election, there were lawn signs for the various candidates all over the place.   Within days of the election, the lawn signs for the losing candidates disappeared.  However, the lawn signs for the winning candidates are still up&#8230;  and as I noted above, its been well over a month since the last election.  </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember seeing this phenomenon at play in other places I&#8217;ve lived (assorted cities and towns in Brazil, California, and Arkansas).  I remember something a bit different, in fact, when it comes to presidential elections &#8211; sure, you still the occasional Obama bumper sticker, but you also still see McCain Palin stickers too.  In fact, every so often I come upon a car with a Kerry or a Bush/Cheney 04 sticker.  But stickers can be a pain in the butt to get off a car, whereas lawn signs require no effort at all to remove.</p>
<p>So what gives?  Is the town small enough that this constitutes signaling to the winning candidates (&#8220;you got a supporter in this home, don&#8217;t forget us!&#8221;).  Is this a way of denoting membership in a favored group &#8211; supporters of a winning candidate?<br />_________________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>A Year and Counting: re-regulation of Wall Street</p>
<p>On Monday night, I participated in a symposium on the Financial Crisis: One Year Later, sponsored by the Center for the Study of Citizenship and others. With me were Larry Ingrassia, Business Editor of the New York Times, and Chip Dickson, CFO of W2Freedom, a private equity fund that purchases community banks. We talked about the causes and potential solutions to the financial crisis and the Great Recession that it had spawned. Much of our focus was on the way financial institutions had grown &#8220;too big to fail&#8221;, creating a &#8220;casino mentality&#8221; that assumed that the government would come to the rescue if needed, thus socializing losses while privatizing gains.</p>
<p>As Amity, <a href="http://letters.salon.com/tech/htww/2009/10/08/cocaine_and_the_financial_crisis/permalink/9d6db439b7859f2604245fc647d11aa6.html" target="_blank">a commenter on Salon&#8217;s post by Andrew Leonard on Wall Street&#8217;s risk-taking</a>, noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>The whole point of society is to moderate and channel wild animal impulses into productive forms. In keeping with that purpose, we as a civilization once saw fit to impose on high finance a series of regulatory restrictions and frameworks for oversight so as to moderate and channel the risk-taking behaviors of financiers.</p>
<p>Then we as a civilization saw fit to remove those restrictions and oversight. The result was as foregone, and as predictable, as if we were stalling an aircraft and letting gravity take over.</p></blockquote>
<p>I kicked off the discussion session of the symposium with the following question:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s been a year now since we were hit with a financial system tsunami, and recognized that we had let banks get “too big to fail” and speculation in derivatives explode. Yet here we are, one year later—we’ve actually encouraged banks to grow larger; we have not yet enacted any regulation of derivatives; we have not yet enacted any tighter regulation of hedge funds and private equity funds or the &#8220;shadow banking&#8221; system generally, we have not yet formed a consumer financial protection agency—in fact, we’ve done essentially nothing to change the conditions that apply. What does this mean, in terms of the stability of the financial system?</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure that there is a satisfactory answer to that question. Because it suggests that our political processes are now so beholden to the corrupting influence of the financial behemoths that we will not be able to find the will to rein them in. See, e.g., Robert Reich, so much happening in D.C., so little to show for it, Salon.com (Oct. 9, 2009) (lamenting the fact that &#8220;Congress is overwhelmed with corporate and Wall Street lobbyists&#8221;).<br />(cross posted from <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2009/10/a-year-and-counting-reregulation-of-wall-street.html">ataxingmatter</a> 10/09/2009)</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/10/13/senate.health.care/index.html?iref=mpstoryview">Key Senate committee passes health care plan</a><br />
<blockquote>The Senate Finance Committee passed a long-awaited $829 billion health care bill Tuesday by a 14-9 vote.  Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, was the lone committee member to cross party lines, breaking with other Republicans to vote for the measure. All the committee&#8217;s Democrats supported the bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>The MSM will lead with Snowe, but the real story to follow is that last sentence. Neither Conrad nor Lincoln left the fold. Meaning that at first glance there is no chance they would vote to keep the merged bill from at least coming to the floor for debate (which was a possibility if they had defected on the SFC bill itself) and I would think little chance they would back a filibuster on final passage.</p>
<p>TPM liveblogged the vote here: <a target="_blank" href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/10/senate-finance-committee-votes-on-health-care-reform-bill.php">LIVEBLOG: Senate Finance Committee Votes On Health Care Reform Bill</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be following this story all day and night but mostly not be able to comment. So consider this an open Health Care thread. I would throw one question out for discussion: Did AHIP overplay its hand by releasing the PWC Report? Because I certainly would not have predicted the Conservadems falling into line the way they did, something got them off the fence.</p>

                                <p>rdan<br />Child Labor Through the Strange Filter of Orthodox Economics</p>
<p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2009/10/child-labor-through-strange-filter-of.html" target="_blank">Peter Dorman</a> at Econospeak notes that our official line concerning child labor in international trade has little research to back it up, and tends to always say &#8216;don&#8217;t mess with trade&#8217;:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is much to endorse in the innards of the argument made by Matthias Doepke and Fabrizio Zilibotti <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/4075">in their recent post on Vox EU</a>. Yes, consumer boycotts and trade sanctions are a poor way to address the blight of child labor, and double yes, income transfer programs that pull poor families out of poverty and keep their kids in school are a proven remedy. But why is it that, whatever the question, the economically correct answer is always “Don’t mess with trade”?</p>
<p>Actually, the fundamental problem with consumer activism around child labor is that very few of the world’s child laborers work in the export sector, and even fewer are part of the value chain for branded products. The sad truth is that first world consumers who obsess about what to buy are mainly assuaging their own conscience and not doing a whole lot for the downtrodden. Whether such activism has more costs than benefits is dubious, however, despite the authors’ assumption-laden modeling exercise.</p></blockquote>
<p>[snip]</p>
<blockquote><p>This crisis has many causes, but none has been more fundamental than the unsustainable imbalances engendered by the very trading system we are instructed not to mess with. It turned out that flooding western markets with goods produced by extremely cheap labor depended on western consumers piling up a mountain of debt. These imbalances have now collapsed, and they will not be rebuilt. If we are to put globalization on a sustainable footing, we will most definitely have to mess with trade, so that it can grow on the basis of a more equitable pattern of demand.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>One other item jumped out at me. The core argument of Doepke/Zilibotti turns out to be this:</p>
<p>&#8220;<em>In our analysis, we find that international interventions weaken domestic support for child-labour restrictions because they reduce competition between children and unskilled adult workers in the labour market. Unskilled workers then have less incentive to push for child-labour regulation.</em><br /><em><br /></em><br /><em>When effective, trade sanctions or consumer boycotts move child workers from formal employment in the export sector to informal production, often in family-based agriculture. In the export sector, particularly in factories, children and adults perform similar tasks and therefore compete directly for jobs. In the informal sector, children and adults usually have different work responsibilities.</em>&#8220;</p>
<p>As it happens, I have <a href="http://www.ilo.org/ipecinfo/product/download.do;jsessionid=0a038009ce94fc4a615bea54960a0c4d4d3d9a793a3.hkzFngTDp6WImQuUaNaKbhD3lN4K-xaIah8S-xyIn3uKmAiN-AnwbQbxaNvzaAmI-huKa30xgx95fjWTa3eIpkzFngTDp6WImQuxb3eKbhyTchyT8OexhOaOgzX9i4j38QfznA5Pp7ftolbGmkTy?type=document&#038;id=7065">actually conducted research</a> into the potential competitive effects of child labor on adult markets. As far as I know, no one else has investigated this empirically. It turns out that children do not always offer higher profits to employers, but they often do, and this situation is not confined to production for export. Let’s not let a little evidence get in the way of their nice, neat theorems, however.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Trying to recover from past mistakes, the Pentagon has initiated a third competition for a new Air Force midair refueling tanker. After two bungled attempts, defense officials, contractors and Congress really need to get it right this time.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>Another unresolved competition is definitely not in the country’s interest. </p>
<p>The new tankers are needed to replace the current Eisenhower-era planes. With the United States engaged in two wars and countless other missions around the globe, the Obama administration, Congress and defense contractors must ensure that, this time, a fair and open bidding process produces the best tanker at the best price to meet the Air Force’s needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why must the Air Force: &#8220;replace the current Eisenhower-era planes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The world is a totally different place than 1951. The &#8220;threats&#8221; are greatly reduced and the implied &#8220;replacing&#8221; avoids treating with the question of why have new expensive hard to maintain tankers to replace Eisenhower era airplanes. My answer is to create a fiction, a reason to spend huge sums of money which make the PAC&#8217;s happy?</p>
<p>One of the defects in DoD weapon system acquisition is the disconnect between what is needed to provide for the common defense and what is bought under the auspices of national security. The Joint Chiefs don&#8217;t identify gaps, and then the non capability gaps are not transformed into technical needs that can be delivered. A perfect circular loop with a logic vacuum. </p>
<p>The KC 135 was designed to complement the B 52, long before buffpilot&#8217;s time. In that mission a huge number of B 52&#8217;s would be refueled enroute to letting Slim Pickens ride his A bomb down on some important Soviet target.</p>
<p>In Vietnam a small number of the total KC 135&#8217;s was sent to make light, short range fighter aircraft into heavily loaded bombers to engage in an expensive and fruitless long range bombing campaign in an unwinnable war.</p>
<p>Later, Air Force spending planners recognized that huge a KC 10 aircraft could be mixed as a tanker and cargo plane. First they bought 40, then they added another 20 to make 60 huge refuelers which could also carry cargo and people, and which never found a mission.</p>
<p>The problem with the Air Force is they want a huge tanker to do all three unnecessary, too expensive and low chance of providing for the common defense missions.</p>
<p>And so their acceptance criteria are 388 issues all not related to the common defense, however they make it possible to debate endlessly the merits of a selection that should not be made. But for the PACs&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>Update:  by ilsm..How many hugely costly air tankers are needed to make up for bad (no or untested) specifications?  </p>
<p>Planning to maintain a level of industry profits is not national security.</p>

<blockquote>[W]hen the New York Times came and offered [Ross Douhat] a column, he did not turn it down saying &#8220;no, I clearly do not deserve this honour, others are far more qualified for it that me&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>The NYT thinks Douhat&#8217;s important because people link to him.  They neither realize—nor care—that you&#8217;re laughing at him.  They just count the links and think he&#8217;s Valuable.</p>
<p>Stop linking.  Please.  Even the thorough destructions (e.g., <a target="_blank" href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/10/concern-trolling-at-its-finest.html">Dave Noon</a>) include the trackback.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t include a link to Douhat.  Think of the children.</p>
