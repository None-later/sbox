<p>I think that a popular approach to welfare economics requires simultaneously holding two contradictory beliefs.</p>
<p>1) Utility is not comparable across individuals so we can only say whether an outcome is Pareto efficient or not.<br />2) Models which are not reality but which approximate reality are useful.</p>
<p>Both are really central to many policy recommendations made by many economists. They don&#8217;t fit together. </p>
<p>Long argument after the jump.</p>
<p>If we accept principle 1) we ask if a proposed reform will achieve a Pareto improvement help some people while hurting none. If we consider a standard economic model, it is often possible to find situations in which a Pareto improvement, that is to say, in which the current situation is Pareto inefficient. </p>
<p>For example, imagine a standard neoclassical general equilibrium model in which all people are equal with equal wealth and income and tastes and &#8230; Then moving from any other tax to a lump sum poll tax will cause a Pareto improvement. It removes distortions to incentives and, with such a tax, everyone is perfectly equal. This gives a Pareto efficient outcome. Also it is the outcome which gives maximum possible total happiness given tastes and technology.</p>
<p>The above paragraph is obviously pointless. We don&#8217;t like poll taxes, because they would impose unreasonable suffering on the poor. We can&#8217;t talk about them sensibly if we start out by assuming there are no rich and no poor.</p>
<p>I think this is a universal problem. When Pareto wrote his book on political economy some (possibly mythical) reviewer said it was a good book but that it contained this silly idea that some reforms might help someone and not hurt anyone. Now for many economists that idea is all that remains of Pareto&#8217;s life work. I think the (possibly mythical) reviewer was right.</p>
<p>Pareto improvements can be found in economic models because they are models. They are simpler than reality. The constraint that the reform hurt no one is much less complicated, because the model is simpler than reality. If the key question is &#8220;is there a Pareto improvement&#8221; then the assumptions made for clarity and tractability are directly related to the answer.</p>
<p>Think of a real world example. How about the holocaust. That sure seems to have been a suboptimal policy. But if Hitler enjoyed it, then preventing it would not have been a Pareto improvement. </p>
<p>If we consider the real world, a Pareto improvement must satisfy 7 billion constraints, actually many more as the reform can&#8217;t hurt the unborn. Simplifying assumptions can&#8217;t be innocent if we are interested in Pareto efficiency.</p>
<p>OK, now consider statement 2. Everyone agrees that economic theory is a set of models, that the models are not reality, and that, at best, they are useful approximations to reality. So we hope that, while things won&#8217;t be exactly as the model predicts, they will be similar. So, for example, if the model says a reform helps people and harms 0% of people, we hope that in the real world it harms a tiny percent of people, say 0.1%. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s enough that it isn&#8217;t a Pareto improvement, so if economists really thought that the only thing we can say about welfare is that this or that is or isn&#8217;t a Pareto improvement, then they should conclude that basing policy on models is a silly mistake.</p>
<p>Needless to say the approach to welfare analysis based on contradictory assumptions is the Fresh Water School&#8217;s approach to welfare analysis. To be frank, I think the post, by itself, shows that everything they have ever said about policy is nonsense.</p>
<p>By the way, I made this argument once in front of Andreu Mas Colell and he nodded (I don&#8217;t claim he has any recollection of this event or even that he definitely nodded in agreement). He, uhm, was highly regarded at the University of Minnesota where he was the resident math genius/general equilibrium theorist. Now he has never been a Republican (his political development was communist, having been jailed 3 times by the Fascists, socialist (I think) at the time I made that argument and now Catalan nationalist. But he sure knows economic theory.</p>

<p>Spare Us From the Invisible Hand </p>
<p>Patrick Kilbride writes in Chamber Post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chamberpost.com/2009/10/free-people-free-minds-free-markets.html">HERE</a>:</p>
<p>“Free People, Free Minds, Free Markets”</p>
<p>‘In the 18th-century, Adam Smith left us with the indelible image of markets producing desirable social outcomes through the work of an &#8220;invisible hand.&#8221; ’</p>
<p>Comment<br />In an otherwise neat argument for both liberty and free markets, Patrick Kilbride spoils his case with modern nonsense about Adam Smith and his use of the metaphor of “an invisible hand”.</p>
<p>Smith did not use the metaphor when explaining either how markets work generally (Books I and II, Wealth Of Nations) or how some, but not all, merchant traders preferred to invest locally following their concerns about the higher risks of investing abroad or in shipping (Book IV.ii, Wealth Of Nations). </p>
<p>In fact, a close reading of the only place in Wealth Of Nations where he used the metaphor of an invisible hand, shows that he first explains in detail the circumstances leading some, but not all, merchant traders to behave as they did (paragraphs 1 to 8, chapter 2, Book IV), and only then deploys the metaphor for the consequences of their specific behaviour (“intending their own security”), conforming to the arithmetic rule that the whole (the national annual output of wealth, including local employment) is the sum of its parts – the more merchant traders who are risk averse, despite the high profits from foreign and colonial trade, the greater the total annual wealth, including domestic employment.</p>
<p>Modern economists have invented a whole new meaning to Smith’s singular use of the metaphor, giving it the characteristics of a “law” of markets, though it was never stated as such by Adam Smith.</p>
<p>The modern invented meaning is commonly taught in first year economics courses and textbooks, and such is the effect of it on modern economists, it is extremely difficult to dislodge it – they seldom actually read Wealth Of Nations or even the relevant paragraphs (1 thru 8) and, by relying on a truncated extract from paragraph 9 only, they remain solidly convinced that Adam Smith explicitly stated what their tutors told them he wrote.</p>
<p>This gives succour to hostile critics of markets who throw the “invisible hand” back at them (“invisible fist” or, as seen recently, “invisible middle finger”, and such like). But there is no actual “invisible hand”, it does not exist and never did. The metaphor is just that, a metaphor, and one that was popular in literature, sermons, and poems in the 17th and 18th centuries – I have a list of 59 examples of its uses, besides Smith’s.</p>
<p>Mathematicians called it into being when “proving” that general equilibrium in an imaginary market, loaded with assumptions that removed all semblances of real world economies, was a theoretical possibility (Debreu, Arrow). Others (Samuelson, Freidman) and among them propagandists against Soviet communist planning, used the metaphor to good effect – Stalin needed the gulags to enforce planning, but free markets had an “invisible hand” that did its work without menace. </p>
<p>Editors of Time, Newsweek, Wall Street Journal, Financial Times and assorted media journalists loved the “invisible hand”, Nobel Prize winners sang it praises, and the epigones believed in its miraculous powers with the passionate certainties of Jihadists.</p>
<p>Worse, the invisible hand became an alibi of last resort, flaunted all round as if it existed. When it “failed”, the invisible hand was dumped among wails and the gnashing of teeth in wholesale “confessionals” (Alan Greenspan). </p>
<p>Markets suddenly became naked – they always were naked, but the veil of the invisible hand obscured their nakedness. It never was the answer to everything that could go awry in the normal condition of disequilibrium in all economies, much of it excited to crises by public policy interventions by legislators and those who influenced them.</p>
<p>Smith was right about them and the damage they could inflict – fortunately “there is a lot of ruin” in an economy, as he might have put it in another context&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s becoming more and more obvious why the first book described John Lott as &#8220;an economist&#8221; and Paul Krugman as a &#8220;Bush critic and NYT columnist.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <del>G7</del> G20 Leader&#8217;s statement, number 20., regarding the <a href="http://www.pittsburghsummit.gov/mediacenter/129639.htm">IMF&#8217;s mission and governance</a> (bold font by yours truly):<br />
<blockquote>The IMF should continue to strengthen its capacity to help its members cope with financial volatility, reducing the economic disruption from sudden swings in capital flows and the perceived need for excessive reserve accumulation. As recovery takes hold, we will work together to strengthen the Fund’s ability to provide even-handed, candid and independent surveillance of the risks facing the global economy and the international financial system.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last week I was in New York talking with Emerging Market strategists and economists. Most of them attended the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/am/2009/index.htm">IMF meetings in Istanbul, Turkey</a> &#8211; according to them, the monster takeaway from the meetings was that the sky&#8217;s the limit in terms of FX reserve accumulation (in EM economies). Put this way, the IMF is unlikely to be successful in its aforementioned goal of preventing the &#8220;need&#8221; of excess reserves, at least over the near term.</p>
<p>Key markets in Asia (China, or South Korea) and Latin America (Brazil) remained rather resilient to the credit crunch late in 2008 due to sufficient (even excessive) reserves holdings. Brazil, for example, was able to supply private-sector financing needs by draining FX ($USD) reserve holdings. South Korea and other Asian economies, too.</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates reserve holdings across key countries in LATAM (Latin America) and Asia &#8211; notice the sharp drop at the end of 2008.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/Stsnv6ASEWI/AAAAAAAACno/e5zuKpHMT2k/s1600-h/LATAM_reserves.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/Stsnv6ASEWI/AAAAAAAACno/e5zuKpHMT2k/s320/LATAM_reserves.png" alt="" border="0"></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/StsnvuFT0qI/AAAAAAAACng/XmOGnwFGlw0/s1600-h/asia_reserves.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/StsnvuFT0qI/AAAAAAAACng/XmOGnwFGlw0/s320/asia_reserves.png" alt="" border="0"></a><br />It&#8217;s an incredulous thought: that policy makers in EM countries &#8211; whether the reserve accumulation was for precautionary reasons (LATAM) or stemming from export-led growth (Asia) &#8211; won&#8217;t be filling the reserve coffers at increasing rates; the process is already underway.</p>
<p>Reserves in Brazil are now 230% higher than they were in 2007 (January), 197% in China, 190% in Thailand, and 163% in Hong Kong. Hong Kong is interesting; amid their strict dollar peg, the <a href="http://www.info.gov.hk/hkma/">Hong Kong Monetary Authority</a> is accumulating reserves faster than most countries (Hong Kong will be the country to watch as the peg against the dollar is sure to result in some inflationary pressures, given that Hong Kong&#8217;s economic fundamentals are stronger than those in the US at this time &#8211; another post).</p>
<p>Record inflows of late into EM financial markets (bonds and equities) are providing plenty of liquidity and contributing to reserve accumulation of late. However, having sufficient FX reserves has proven to be the best insurance out there against a stoppage in external financing. And as long as inflation pressures remain muted, acquiring reserves is not too costly economically (there are administrative costs, though, from sterilization when US Treasury rates are near zero).</p>

<blockquote>Although China’s overall policies played an important role in anchoring the global economy in 2009 and promoting a reduction in its current account surplus, the recent lack of flexibility of the renminbi exchange rate and China’s renewed accumulation of foreign exchange reserves risk unwinding some of the progress made in reducing imbalances as stimulus policies are eventually withdrawn and demand by China’s trading partners recovers.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s farcical to think that the G7 can browbeat EM countries into curtailing excessive reserve accumulation. To be sure, <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2009/wp09172.pdf">export growth is simply not going to grow</a> China at rates sufficient to maintain jobs growth (9% or so) and reserve balances are likely to be increasingly focused inward domestically (supporting the financial system, local governments, etc.). However, what seems to be very real is that targeted reserve accumulation, in whatever currency but still heavily weighted in $US, buffered EM countries from catastrophe and is not going away.</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>So I check my mail today, 10/17 (been attending continuing ed this weekend) and find that as a member of the National Association of the Self-Employed (150K strong) I will now receive a news letter of sorts from a John Mauldin by receiving his latest: Muddle Through, R.I.P?   Muddle Through is some interpretation of his from 2002 as to what the economy was.  In a word the economy was: Yawn.  Slow growth, jobless recovery.</p>
<p>He then gets into his real message: Deficits as far as you can see thus, we&#8217;re screwed.  Here we come Japan, “Japanese Disease”, unless we can get savings and there is a way to do it. (Can you guess where he&#8217;s going?)</p>
<p>Mr. Mauldin starts off with some math and explanation to make his case:<br />
<blockquote>GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is defined as Consumption (C) plus Investment (I) plus Government Spending (G) plus [Exports (E) minus Imports (I)] or: <br />GDP = C + I + G + (E-I)<br />(For the wonks out there, GDP is usually termed &#8220;Y&#8221;.)</p>
<p>This equation is known as an identity. An identity is an equality that remains true regardless of the values of any variables that appear within it. That means it is not a guess or an approximation. It is simple reality.</p>
<p>Thus, if there is a government deficit, there must be savings by both consumers and businesses, plus capital flows from outside the country, to offset that deficit in order for there to be any money left over for investments&#8230; There must be savings in order for there to be investment. And without investment, you do not get job growth or economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>During his Japanese Disease part of the argument we get to the bottom line:<br />
<blockquote>Since government deficit spending has no long-term multiplier effect, growth has been nonexistent. (By the way, that research about multiplier effects has also been done by Christina Romer, the chairman of the current President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisors, and further explored by European economists. There is general agreement on these facts.)</p></blockquote>
<p>He then quotes Professor Barro (do you see now where he&#8217;s going?):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230;The government problem is complicated by the fact that the tax multiplier is 3, meaning that a 1% change in taxes will change GDP by about 3% over time. More recent research (Barro &#038; Redlick, September 2009, &#8220;NBER Working Paper 15369&#8243;) suggests that a 1% cut in the marginal tax rate would raise GDP in the ensuing year by 0.6%. With the deficit rising due to a zero spending multiplier, the tendency will be to try to raise taxes to pay for this higher level of expenditures, which will further depress aggregate spending and output.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there it is, some Romer interpretation.  But, we&#8217;re not fully there as to the solution.  The banks are missing in this presentation until Mr. Mauldin asks who will buy this debt?   <em>“I think that the buyers of the debt could be US banks for quite some time&#8230;”</em> then notes that banks are not lending and asks:<br />
<blockquote>So where do banks put their cash and reserves they are not lending? At the Fed and in Treasury debt. If you can leverage capital at ten to one (as banks can) and if you get 2% (for longer-term debt) and if you only have costs of, say, 50 basis points (or 0.5%), you can make a return on equity of 15% with no risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, they are not lending because there is no need to in order to make money which has hurt small and medium businesses by cutting off their “life blood” resulting in no job creation.</p>
<p>Oh, another thing, banks are taking a hit on commercial real estate so they need to save (his words are “raise capital”).  Poor banks are just trying to survive and the lowly job seekers are just the collateral damage. So sorry.</p>
<p>Are you following?  Massive government deficit is causing the banks to park their government created money in the government and it&#8217;s killing our jobs because the small and medium business can&#8217;t  get a loan because the banks need to save in order to cover the commercial real estate losses.  <br />
<blockquote>Large government deficits choke off the very investment that we need to create jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>So just what would the banks do about the commercial real estate losses if the government didn&#8217;t have this massive debt to make money off of?  How would they save?  Does this part of his argument not suggest that the deficit is good if the goal is to save the banks?  That has been the goal after all.</p>
<p>This get&#8217;s us to the Romers specifically.  At the end of the debt bad (but good for the banks), we&#8217;re contracting Japanese Disease, banks are being banks (being savings institutions) and it is all killing the jobs we get this:<br />Given that the current Congress is hell bent on massively raising taxes in 2011, we are likely to dip back into recession by then, if not before. Remember, taxes have a multiplier effect of three. That means tax cuts increase GDP (over time) by three times their amount. But tax increases reduce GDP by three times the increase. That will make deficits worse, and unemployment will again start to rise from already high levels. Twenty states have already raised sales taxes, and more are raising other taxes. It is a vicious spiral.</p>
<p>You know what is missing from his argument which, because it is missing makes it a bastard argument?  It is this: <br />http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/draft1108.pdf<br />Panel (d) shows that the point estimates for the effect of a deficit-driven tax increase of 1% of GDP on GDP are consistently positive. However, there are too few tax changes of this type for the effects to be estimated precisely. <strong>The maximum impact is a rise in GDP of 2.48%</strong> (t = 1.03). While one should be very cautious in reading anything into such imprecise estimates, <strong>the results are suggestive that tax increases to reduce an inherited deficit may be less costly than other tax increases.</strong></p>
<p>You know what is another example of a bastard argument?  It is the one made by the person that took some medical well baby guidelines and implemented a policy that prevented a 4 month old from getting health insurance coverage for being too fat!  </p>
<p>Bastardization of research happens all the time by the health insurance industry.  I hope there are other doc&#8217;s on Mr. Mauldin&#8217;s email list that make the same recognition of his argument.  I don&#8217;t see how they can&#8217;t.  We deal with it every day.   </p>

<p>Not the intertubes, 18 mile long tubes held up by helium baloons releasing S02 into the stratosphere.</p>
<p>Daniel Davies writes </p>
<blockquote><p>if you find yourself writing, in all seriousness, as a practical proposal, the phrase &#8220;pumping large quantities of sulphur dioxide into the Earth’s stratosphere through an 18-mile-long hose, held up by helium balloons&#8221;, it is probably time to take a step back and ask yourself if something has gone a little bit wrong with your life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok so I asked myself and I still think that pumping large quantities of sulphur dioxide into the Earth’s stratosphere through an 18-mile-long hose, held up by helium balloons would be excellent.</p>
<p>Davies is one of many many people who criticize the chapter on global warming of &#8220;Superfreakonomics&#8221; by Steves Levitt and Dubner.  The most quoted takedowns were written by <a href="http://climateprogress.org/2009/10/12/superfreakonomics-errors-levitt-caldeira-myhrvold/">Joe Romm </a>and by <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/deltoid/2009/10/why_everything_in_superfreakon.php">Tim Lambert</a>.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, they really don&#8217;t have very much to say against the acid rain tubes idea.  Rather they mainly object to the Steves proposal that we use the tubes as an alternative to cap and trade. The argument against doing both seems fairly weak to me. </p>
<p>There is the Leninist argument that the worse it is the better it is so any way to ameliorate global warming other than reducing emissions is bad, because it wil reduce pressure for reduced emissions.  No one feels obliged to paint their roof black to increase pressure for emissions reductions and I don&#8217;t see the difference.</p>
<p>Now there are clearly problems with the acid in the stratosphere approach.  The S02 won&#8217;t stay there forever.  It seems to me that the best way to defend the tubes proposal is to lye &#8212; that is dump something alkaline in the oceans (this is both to deal with sulfuric acid from the tubes and carbonic acid from C02).  Now if one aimed to do that in a way which wouldn&#8217;t create extremely alkaline areas and kill marine life, it would cost a lot.  I think that cost should be added to the tubes cost.</p>
<p>Also it might not work.  A case for not relying on the tubes but not, as far as I can see, a case for not trying them.</p>
<p>Joe Romm stresses the importance of positive feedback in global warming &#8212; he notes ways in which a hotter climate causes more emissions due to more forest fires and more bark beetles.  Others have discussed the possibility that methane released from melting arctic tundra will cook us.  To me, this describes ways in which the tubes approach will reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses (seems to follow no ?).  It seems to me conceivable that the most cost effective way to reduce emissions of greenhouse gasses is the 19 mile long tubes approach.  </p>
<p>Both Romm and Lambert argue that if we send up S02, then stop, then the temperature will soon be the same as it would have been with no S02.  This seems to me to be inconsistent with the limits of bark beetle reproduction and mobility and the way forest fires really happen and all that.  There argument seems to be high temperatures cause high emissions *and* keeping the temperature low means just the same emissions waiting in the atmosphere for us to drop our S02 guard.  I don&#8217;t see how they can believe both claims at the same time.</p>

                                <p>The tax code seems to foster one boondoggle after another.  The ones getting my attention this week are the alternative fuel tax credits enacted in the 2005 highway bill.  This was intended as a credit to encourage the development of alternative fuels for vehicles to cut our reliance on global warming-causing fossil fuels. See Natural Gas Vehicles for America, &#8220;<a href="http://www.ngvc.org/pdfs/Notice2006-92RegSum2.pdf">Regulatory Summary: Alternative Fuel Credit-IRS Notice 2006-92&#8243;</a> (Sept. 30, 2006) (discussing the alternative fuel credit of 50 cents a gallon under section 11113 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users). But it was modified in 2007 , and as a result the paper mills discovered a credit for a process the industry had been using since the 1930s &#8211;it just had to add (in some cases) enough diesel fuel to qualify.</p>
<p>The paper industry essentially cooks wood pulp to turn it into paper, and a byproduct of that process is a dark sludge called &#8220;black liquor&#8221;. The companies use the black liquor as a fuel to generate steam for electricity. And by adding just a small amount of real diesel fuel to the mix, they qualify for the alternative fuel mixture tax credit. And, not surprisingly, they love the &#8220;extra cash flow and income.&#8221; See Sharon, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105004252">Paper Industry: Don&#8217;t Kill Fuel Credit</a>, NPR (June 6, 2009) (reporting a $10 million savings from the credit in the past year for one company).</p>
<p>Sen. Bingaman suggested that the paper industries discovery of this black gold hasn&#8217;t got much to do with the development of alternative fuels.<br />
<blockquote>The alternative fuel mixture credit was originally intended to encourage<br />the development and use of alternative fuels as a way to decrease global warming<br />pollution. But by adding fossil fuel to their black liquor mix, Bingaman<br />says, paper companies are rewarded 50 cents a gallon for doing the<br />opposite. Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bingaman wasn&#8217;t the only critic. Canada joined with other countries to demand that the US end the paper industry subsidy, threatening a trade action because of the way the credit had distorted global pulp markets. <a href="http://schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/11/black-liquor/">Schott&#8217;s Vocab: Black Liquor</a>, NY Times, June 11, 2009.</p>
<p>Some companies had in fact used diesel all along in their effort to burn their own byproduct to produce energy, while others had changed the fuel blend to benefit from the tax credit. Companies claimed that they are doing exactly what the law intended. The Natural Resources Defense Council disagreed, calling it a &#8220;travesty&#8221; because it has meant reduced reliance on biomass fuels and increased consumption of fossil fuels &#8220;in order to rip off the American taxpayer.&#8221; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/18/business/energy-environment/18sludge.html">Lawmakers May Limt Paper Mills&#8217; Windfall</a>, NY Times (Apr. 17, 2009).</p>
<p>This particular credit is supposed to sunset at the end of 2009, but companies wanted it continued. Let&#8217;s face it, few corporations that have found a piece of corporate welfare in the Code are interested at all in seeing that &#8220;entitlement&#8221; turned off. The amounts are significant&#8211;for International Paper, $71.6 million for just one month from mid-November to mid-December last year. See <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/27/AR2009032703116.html">Papermakers Dig Deep in Highway Bill to Hit Gold</a>, Washington Post, Mar. 28, 2009. Not surprisingly, representatives of pulp mill states  seem to think the credit is great&#8211;Republican Olympia Snowe called it a &#8220;critical lifeline to thousands of paper mills&#8221;. Snowe, <a href="http://www.magic-city-news.com/Olympia_Snowe/What_the_Black_Liquor_Tax_Credit_Means_for_Maine11876.shtml">What the Black Liquor Tax Credit Means for Maine</a>, Apr. 25, 2009.</p>
<p>The Obama administration wanted to stop the billions flowing under this provision to the paper industry, we were told in May. See <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/08/AR2009050803776.html">Obama Seeks to Halt Alternative Fuel Tax Credit for Paper Industry</a>, Washington Post, May 9, 2006.  At $6 billion a year, eliminating the credit&#8211;even retroactively for 2009 (it expires in December, unless extended)&#8211; for the paper industry could generate some revenue and at least some in Congress were considering just that.  See <a href="http://www.accuval.net/insights/featuredarticle/detail.php?ID=49">Black Liquor Tax Credits: A Closing Loophole for the Pulp &#038; Paper Industries</a>, Accuval, Sept. 2009.  Of course, the companies lobbied for maintaining it through 2009 and in fact for extending it for at least three years.  See Appleton Papers et al, <a href="http://finance.senate.gov/press/Bpress/Alternative%20Fuels%20Documents/Alt_Fuels_Commentary/Appleton%20Papers_et_al.pdf">Comments to the Senate Finance Committee on the Alternative Fuel Mixture Tax Credit </a>(July 9, 2009).</p>
<p>Now, it turns out that there is another biofuel tax credit that already extends through 2013, passed as part of the 2008 Farm Bill.  See Voegele, <a href="http://www.biomassmagazine.com/article.jsp?article_id=2322">IRS: Cellulosic biofuels are eligible for tax credit</a>, BioMass Magazine (Dec. 29, 2008) (describing <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-08-110.pdf">Notice 2008-110</a>, which describes the tax credits under sections 40A, 6426, and 6427(e) for biodiesel and cellulosic biofuels, enacted in the 2008 Farm Bill for the years 2010-2013).  See Committee on Finance, <a href="http://finance.senate.gov/press/Bpress/2008press/prb041408.pdf">Finance Committee Leaders Detail Elements of Farm Bill Tax Package</a>, page 3, Apr. 14, 2008. </p>
<p>Black Liquor is certainly cellulosic, so the mills may have something even better to replace the expiring black liquor alternative fuels tax credit&#8211;instead of 50 cents a gallon, they may qualify for the cellulosic biofuel credit amounting to $1.01 a gallon! Let&#8217;s see.  That&#8217;d apparently mean a subsidy double the current one invested in &#8220;incentivizing&#8221; paper mills into doing what they&#8217;ve already been doing since 1930&#8211;converting wood waste into a source of energy to power the mills.  See Donville, U.S. Paper Makers&#8217; Black-Liquor Tax Break May Reach $25 Billion, Bloomburg.com (Oct. 15, 2009) (quoting Mark Connelly that we should &#8220;Think of this as a potential black-liquor II&#8221; and Marty Sullivan as forecasting &#8220;$25 billion in tax reductions for pulp producers claiming the cellulosic biofuel tax credit over the next three years&#8221;).</p>
<p>This credit for the paper industry is of slightly smaller magnitude than the bailout we gave the auto industry.  In both cases, the argument is that these industries employ many who would otherwise lose their jobs, and who but the government will be willing to help them through these extraordinarily tough times.  Yet both industries produce a product that we ought to learn to do without&#8211;the gas guzzlers that Detroit was producing pollute the air, require the destruction of vast land for roads, and use enormous amounts of energy in the process, while pulp mills chew up world forests at a frightening rate producing tons of waste that must be absorbed.</p>
<p>I wish it were as easy to get Congress to increase the taxes owed by the superrich as it is to get them to add boondoggles for one industry or another in the form of a tax break in the tax code.  I want to see alternative energy succeed, but I&#8217;m not sure these tax credits are targeted sufficiently at the new technologies that we should be encouraging.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.miller-mccune.com/news/stereotypes-loom-larger-as-our-brains-age-1505">Stereotypes and the brain</a> suggests that older folk (over 60-88) are more susceptible to stereotypical thinking than younger people (age 18-25).</p>
<blockquote><p>A decade ago, a research team led by William von Hippel of the University of Queensland challenged that assumption. The psychologists proposed that older people may exhibit greater prejudice because they have difficulty inhibiting (bolding mine) the stereotypes that regularly get activated in all of our brains. They suggested an aging brain is not as effective in suppressing unwanted information — including stereotypes.</p>
<p>In two recently published papers, von Hippel and Gabriel Radvansky of the University of Notre Dame provide compelling support for this concept. In the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, they describe a series of experiments designed to assess whether older adults were relatively more likely to draw and remember stereotypic inferences.</p>
<p>Forty-eight older adults (age 60 to 88) and 71 younger adults (age 18 to 25), read four stories, each of which &#8220;allowed for stereotypic inferences.&#8221; Two of the tales featured African Americans, one dealt with people from Appalachia, and one involved Jews. After finishing the stories, the participants were shown a series of statements relevant to the tale, and asked to rate them as true or false. Some of these statements were strictly factual, while others contained inferences of stereotypes.</p>
<p>The results revealed &#8220;significantly greater memory strength among older adults for stereotype-consistent situation models,&#8221; the researchers write. &#8220;This finding supports our suggestion that older adults are more likely to make stereotypic inferences during comprehension, and that this stereotyping carries over into their later memory for that information.&#8221;</p>
<p>This process &#8220;appears to be a more general phenomenon of aging,&#8221; they note, adding that some older adults &#8220;may be relying on stereotypes despite their best intentions to the contrary.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second paper, published earlier this year in the journal Aging, Neuropsychology and Cognition, contains a way around this problem. It describes a study in which older and younger adults read a story in which a central character was employed in a sex-stereotyped profession. In half the stories, the character&#8217;s gender was consistent with the stereotype (a male plumber), while in the other half it was inconsistent (a female plumber).</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Results revealed that with explicit labeling, older adults were able to discount their stereotypes and avoid processing difficulties when subsequent stereotype-inconsistent information was encountered,&#8221; the researchers write. &#8220;These data suggest that when counter-stereotypical information is explicitly provided at encoding (that is, the first stage of the memory process, in which stimuli are initially registered), older adults are no more likely than younger adults to rely on stereotypes, and are similarly capable of altering their interpretation of a situation when information suggests that information is incorrect.&#8221;</p>
<p>In real life, of course, no one is pointing out biased statements as they emerge from the mouths or friends, family members or talk-show hosts. So for older adults, the best advice might be to avoid acquaintances who speak in stereotypes. This research suggests prejudice can be contagious, and we become more susceptible as our brains age.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have not read the protocols nor the material, but several thoughts occur:</p>
<p>1.) Since the age gap is so wide, can one measure the common thread of stereotypical thinking from only one set of examples?  Can you fashion a story that is common to both generations and isolate from socialization?</p>
<p>2.) Part of the theory involves brain based cognition, as the brain enters a more fluid phase of brain cell connections during the teens to early twenties. However, connections in older adults might be fewer overall but can be more complex in connections.  What that means is not clear.</p>
<p>Sort of like blonde jokes, you know.  Substitute brunette and the joke isn&#8217;t funny anymore.</p>
