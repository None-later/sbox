<p>In my childhood and teens I counted on The Washington Post (motto &#8220;All the President&#8217;s Men.  If you liked the movie, you&#8217;ll love the newspaper,&#8221;  so now I guess I will have to relearn mathematics to adapt to the fact that 500,000 = 0.</p>

<p>In defense of George Will&#8217;s claim &#8220;According to the University of Illinois&#8217; Arctic Climate Research Center, global sea ice levels now equal those of 1979.&#8221;  Post ombudsman Andy Alexander provided this link <a href="http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/global.sea.ice.area.pdf">http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/global.sea.ice.area.pdf</a>** to a *one page* document which includes the text</p>
<p>&#8220;However, observed N. Hemisphere sea ice area is almost one million sq. km below values seen in late 1979 and S. Hemisphere sea ice area is about 0.5 million sq. km above that seen in late 1979, partly offsetting the N.Hemisphere reduction.&#8221;  Now I thought that 1 million &#8211; 0.5 million = -500,000 != 0.</p>
<p>update: notes added and link made clickable.  also one zpelling correction.</p>
<p>* There is an engraved bronze bell in the Washington Post building which refers in bronze to the post and it&#8217;s editor or something.</p>
<p>** The link is now clickable thanks to cursed in comments.</p>
<p>update II pulled back from comments</p>
<p>2slugbaits says:<br />Yesterday, 5:53:58 PM<br />“George Will has a problem getting basic facts right.  This isn&#8217;t the first time.  For example, a few months ago he had a column about government salaries.  He got the numbers wrong.  A simple fact to verify.  I sent him a link to the Office of Personnel Management site that showed government wages and salaries by region.  He never corrected his post.  He never even sent a private thank you.  He just collected his paycheck from the WaPo and went about writing even more fact challenged editorials.</p>
<p>See also <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200902200022?f=h_column">this mediamatters article on Will.  <br /></a> <br />update III: Washington post ombudsman Andrew Alexander has withdrawn his claim that 1,000,000 = 500,000.  More after the jump.</p>
<p>I explain the arithmetic subtleties of whether 0 = 500,000,000 after the jump.</p>
<p>The Washington Post is resting it&#8217;s* credibility on the claim that 500,000 = 0, that is, that one half is approximately one &#8212; the difference between the magnitude of estimated changes in the North and the South, which the Post asserts is zero, is equal to the estimated change in the South, which is Will&#8217;s only point.  This means the Post is saying both that 500,000 sq miles is insignificant and negligible and that it is important evidence.</p>
<p>In context the cited document argues that, even if, global sea ice areas were constant, the decrease in the Northern Hemisphere would be strong evidence of global warming and the increase in the Southern Hemisphere would be what is predictedy by some models of global warming (presumably not all models and presumably those some models were written after the fact was noted).  That is, the cited publication argued that world wide sea ice levels are neither a useful statistic to test models of global warming against the alternative that climatologists are full of it nor a useful statistic to test the null that the climate isn&#8217;t warming.  A clause from that argument, taken out of context, was used by Will to falsely assert &#8220;According to the University of Illinois&#8217; Arctic Climate Research Center, global sea ice levels now equal those of 1979&#8221; even though that specific claim of fact is inconsistent with text in the cited document.</p>
<p>Now I understand that the cited document is a whole page long (with only one picture) but couldn&#8217;t Mssrs Alexander and Will have read it before claiming that it said the opposite of what it said ?</p>
<p>update III:  Andrew Alexander has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/27/AR2009022702334_2.html?sub=AR&#038;sid=ST2009022702494">a new column on the controversy</a>.</p>
<p>In this column he revises his original conclusion and concludes that 500,000 <br />
<blockquote>The editors who checked the Arctic Research Climate Center Web site believe it did not, on balance, run counter to Will&#8217;s assertion that global sea ice levels &#8220;now equal those of 1979.&#8221; I reviewed the same Web citation and reached a different conclusion. </p></blockquote>
<p>This time Anderson provided a link to the <a href="http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/">home page of the center</a>  not the pdf which contained the numbers 1 million and 0.5 million.  In fact he still doesn&#8217;t mention the number 0.5 million or note that it is less than one million.  My original post noted that he had claimed that this document confirmed Will&#8217;s claim, that is, that 500,000 = 1,000,000.  Now he tells us he has changed his mind, but, it seems, makes it difficult for us to understand why &#8212; that is he doesn&#8217;t note that earlier column implied that 500,000 = 1,000,000.  </p>
<p>Like <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/02/washington-post-crashed-and-burned-watch-the-post-needs-a-new-ombudsman.html">Brad DeLong,</a> I am unable to doubt that he posted the link to the one page document without reading the document.  Still better late than never.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;There is no such thing as a neoconservative foreign policy,&#8221; Perle informed the gathering, hosted by National Interest magazine. &#8220;It is a left critique of what is believed by the commentator to be a right-wing policy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>&#8220;I see a number of people here who believe and have expressed themselves abundantly that there is a neoconservative foreign policy and it was the policy that dominated the Bush administration, and they ascribe to it responsibility for the deplorable state of the world,&#8221; Perle told the foreign policy luminaries at yesterday&#8217;s lunch. &#8220;None of that is true, of course.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Sorry this can&#8217;t be allowed to stand. The Neo-Conservatives openly and jointed outlined their principles in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/statementofprinciples.htm">Project for a New American Century: Statement of Principles</a> and then signed it. Their website disappeared before so I will put a full copy of the statement and its signatories below the fold so that people can decide for themselves whether Perle is deluded or lying here. Because I don&#8217;t see a third alternative.Bolding is mine. June 3rd 1997<br />
<blockquote>American foreign and defense policy is adrift. Conservatives have criticized the incoherent policies of the Clinton Administration. They have also resisted isolationist impulses from within their own ranks. But conservatives have not confidently advanced a strategic vision of America&#8217;s role in the world. They have not set forth guiding principles for American foreign policy. They have allowed differences over tactics to obscure potential agreement on strategic objectives. And they have not fought for a defense budget that would maintain American security and advance American interests in the new century.</p>
<p>We aim to change this. We aim to make the case and rally support for American global leadership.</p>
<p>As the 20th century draws to a close, the United States stands as the world&#8217;s preeminent power. Having led the West to victory in the Cold War, America faces an opportunity and a challenge: Does the United States have the vision to build upon the achievements of past decades? Does the United States have the resolve to shape a new century favorable to American principles and interests?</p>
<p>We are in danger of squandering the opportunity and failing the challenge. We are living off the capital &#8212; both the military investments and the foreign policy achievements &#8212; built up by past administrations. Cuts in foreign affairs and defense spending, inattention to the tools of statecraft, and inconstant leadership are making it increasingly difficult to sustain American influence around the world. And the promise of short-term commercial benefits threatens to override strategic considerations. As a consequence, we are jeopardizing the nation&#8217;s ability to meet present threats and to deal with potentially greater challenges that lie ahead.</p>
<p>We seem to have forgotten the essential elements of the Reagan Administration&#8217;s success: a military that is strong and ready to meet both present and future challenges; a foreign policy that boldly and purposefully promotes American principles abroad; and national leadership that accepts the United States&#8217; global responsibilities.</p>
<p>Of course, the United States must be prudent in how it exercises its power. But we cannot safely avoid the responsibilities of global leadership or the costs that are associated with its exercise. America has a vital role in maintaining peace and security in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. If we shirk our responsibilities, we invite challenges to our fundamental interests. The history of the 20th century should have taught us that it is important to shape circumstances before crises emerge, and to meet threats before they become dire. The history of this century should have taught us to embrace the cause of American leadership.</p>
<p>Our aim is to remind Americans of these lessons and to draw their consequences for today. Here are four consequences:</p>
<p>• we need to increase defense spending significantly if we are to carry out our global <br />responsibilities today and modernize our armed forces for the future;</p>
<p>• we need to strengthen our ties to democratic allies and to challenge regimes hostile to our interests and values;</p>
<p>• we need to promote the cause of political and economic freedom abroad;</p>
<p>• we need to accept responsibility for America&#8217;s unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security, our prosperity, and our principles.</p>
<p>Such a Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity may not be fashionable today. But it is necessary if the United States is to build on the successes of this past century and to ensure our security and our greatness in the next.</p>

<p> Sorry Dick that is a Neo-Conservative foreign policy and signed by what would be the top national security officials of the Bush White House and Pentagon. But where is Dick? Well his name shows up in another document, this one the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/iraqclintonletter.htm">Letter to President Clinton on Iraq</a><br />Jan 28, 1998<br />
<blockquote>The Honorable William J. Clinton<br />President of the United States<br />Washington, DC</p>
<p>Dear Mr. President:</p>
<p>We are writing you because we are convinced that current American policy toward Iraq is not succeeding, and that we may soon face a threat in the Middle East more serious than any we have known since the end of the Cold War.  In your upcoming State of the Union Address, you have an opportunity to chart a clear and determined course for meeting this threat.  We urge you to seize that opportunity, and to enunciate a new strategy that would secure the interests of the U.S. and our friends and allies around the world.  That strategy should aim, above all, at the removal of Saddam Hussein’s regime from power.  We stand ready to offer our full support in this difficult but necessary endeavor.</p>
<p>The policy of “containment” of Saddam Hussein has been steadily eroding over the past several months.  As recent events have demonstrated, we can no longer depend on our partners in the Gulf War coalition to continue to uphold the sanctions or to punish Saddam when he blocks or evades UN inspections.  Our ability to ensure that Saddam Hussein is not producing weapons of mass destruction, therefore, has substantially diminished.  Even if full inspections were eventually to resume, which now seems highly unlikely, experience has shown that it is difficult if not impossible to monitor Iraq’s chemical and biological weapons production.  The lengthy period during which the inspectors will have been unable to enter many Iraqi facilities has made it even less likely that they will be able to uncover all of Saddam’s secrets.  As a result, in the not-too-distant future we will be unable to determine with any reasonable level of confidence whether Iraq does or does not possess such weapons.</p>
<p>Such uncertainty will, by itself, have a seriously destabilizing effect on the entire Middle East.  It hardly needs to be added that if Saddam does acquire the capability to deliver weapons of mass destruction, as he is almost certain to do if we continue along the present course, the safety of American troops in the region, of our friends and allies like Israel and the moderate Arab states, and a significant portion of the world’s supply of oil will all be put at hazard.  As you have rightly declared, Mr. President, the security of the world in the first part of the 21st century will be determined largely by how we handle this threat.</p>
<p>Given the magnitude of the threat, the current policy, which depends for its success upon the steadfastness of our coalition partners and upon the cooperation of Saddam Hussein, is dangerously inadequate. The only acceptable strategy is one that eliminates the possibility that Iraq will be able to use or threaten to use weapons of mass destruction. In the near term, this means a willingness to undertake military action as diplomacy is clearly failing. In the long term, it means removing Saddam Hussein and his regime from power. That now needs to become the aim of American foreign policy.</p>
<p>We urge you to articulate this aim, and to turn your Administration&#8217;s attention to implementing a strategy for removing Saddam&#8217;s regime from power. This will require a full complement of diplomatic, political and military efforts. Although we are fully aware of the dangers and difficulties in implementing this policy, we believe the dangers of failing to do so are far greater. We believe the U.S. has the authority under existing UN resolutions to take the necessary steps, including military steps, to protect our vital interests in the Gulf. <u>In any case</u>, American policy cannot continue to be crippled by a misguided insistence on unanimity in the UN Security Council.</p>
<p>We urge you to act decisively. If you act now to end the threat of weapons of mass destruction against the U.S. or its allies, you will be acting in the most fundamental national security interests of the country. If we accept a course of weakness and drift, we put our interests and our future at risk.</p>

<p>I could have bolded more names. But what really can&#8217;t be denied is that with the notable exceptions of Rice and Powell (who were largely side-lined by the people around Cheney) pretty much the entirety of what would become the Bush National Security team had already banded together and formulated a plan to invade Iraq. In 1997.</p>
<p>Sorry Dick. Neo-Conservatives can try to write themselves and their role in Bush Administration policy out of history. But maybe you should have taken the PNAC website down first. You wanted a war, you got a war, too bad it didn&#8217;t work out for you. But man up here.</p>

<blockquote><p>The world is now in a period of epic economic chaos. People are disoriented and unsure of what it will take to restore their economies. Many serious economists, financiers, and executives are loath to even forecast when an economic recovery might begin. It&#8217;s easier for me now to understand how my parents and grandparents must have felt during the 1930s.<br />&#8230;<br />But the peak oil problem has not gone away. World liquid fuels production reached a plateau in mid-2004 and has fluctuated within a relatively narrow range in spite of mighty efforts to increase world production. In mid-2008, benefitting from the work of Campbell, Laherrere, Skrebowski, Aleklett, Simmons, Robelius, Gilbert, Bentley, Al Husseini, Deffeyes, Koppelaar, Birol, and others, I came to believe that world liquids production might stay on the existing plateau for the next 2-5 years and then go into a 3-5% per year decline.<br />&#8230;<br />Recently, OPEC cut back oil production in an attempt to stem the oil price decline. How much might their cutbacks delay the onset of world liquid fuels production decline? Assuming the plateau model and five years to the onset of decline, each million barrels per day of oil production withholding buys roughly three weeks delay, so a steady, continuing reduction of say four million barrels per day over five years might result in a delay in the onset of world oil production decline by maybe three months. That&#8217;s not very much. We&#8217;ve now in a period of major human disorientation, but geology does not become disoriented on the human timescale.</p></blockquote>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://bostonreview.net/BR34.1/baker.php#c5t_form">Boston Review</a> carries an article by Dean Baker that frames regulation in a much more interesting way than is typical to media and political punditry.  In my opinion, of course.  But it makes talking to my conservative friends much easier when we discuss reality.</p>
<p>Dean Baker says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The extraordinary financial collapse of recent months has been commonly described as a testament to the failure of deregulation. The events are indeed testament to a failure—a failure of public policy. Blaming deregulation is misleading.</p>
<p>In general, political debates over regulation have been wrongly cast as disputes over the extent of regulation, with conservatives assumed to prefer less regulation, while liberals prefer more. In fact conservatives do not necessarily desire less regulation, nor do liberals necessarily desire more. Conservatives support regulatory structures that cause income to flow upward, while liberals support regulatory structures that promote equality. “Less” regulation does not imply greater inequality, nor is the reverse true.</p>
<p>Framing regulation debates in terms of more and less is not only inaccurate; it hugely biases the argument toward conservative positions by characterizing an extremely intrusive structure of, for example, patent and copyright rules, as the free market. In the realm of insurance and finance over the last two decades, calls for deregulation have been cover for rules tilted starkly toward corporate interests. And the recent change in bankruptcy law, hailed by conservatives, requires much greater government involvement in the economy.</p>
<p>False ideological claims have circumscribed the public debate over regulation and blinded us to the wide range of choices we can make. Without these claims, what would guide regulatory policy? What kinds of choices would we have?</p></blockquote>

<p>A few years ago the Social Security Trustees began publishing a warning that went something like this: &#8220;After the year 2040 Social Security will only be able to meet 75% of promised benefits.&#8221; </p>
<p>You may have gotten this message in the mail, or heard it while waiting to talk to Social Security on the telephone. But look at what it really says. </p>
<p>If Social Security can meet 3/4 of promised benefits with the existing tax, it could meet ALL promised benefits with a 33% tax raise. 3/4 times 4/3 equals One. </p>
<p>But the current tax is 6.2% of payroll. 33% of 6.2 is 2.1. So a 2% raise in the payroll tax would enable Social Security to meet all promised benefits. </p>
<p>Current average income is 700 dollars per week. 2% of 700 is 14 dollars. (For a low wage worker, the tax increase would be about 7 dollars per week.) </p>
<p>Projected average income in 2040 is 1000 dollars per week. 2% of 1000 is 20 dollars per week. </p>
<p>So Social Security can be &#8220;saved&#8221; by a 20 dollar increase in tax on an income that has increased by 300 dollars by the time the raise is needed. The reason the raise will be needed is to pay for the six extra years of life expectancy those future tax payers will have compared to us. The 20 dollar raise will preserve their benefits at current replacement value and allow them to retire at the normal age. </p>
<p>This is not a crisis. </p>
<p>I can say a great deal more about this. But this is enough for lesson one. Except to point out that Peter Peterson has convinced everyone, including some bi-partisan experts and possibly Barack Obama that 20 dollars times 2 (boss&#8217;s share) times 52 weeks times 200 million taxpayers times 75 years is an &#8220;Unfunded Deficit of 31 Trillion Dollars!!&#8221; Which of course it is. He hopes you will not do the arithmetic and realize it is still only 20 dollars a week. Or realize that it is &#8220;unfunded&#8221; because we don&#8217;t need to pay for it in advance. <br />__________________________<br />guest post by Coberly.</p>

<p>Fiscal conservatives that involve two parties is bi-partisan, not non-partisan.  And David Walker is hardly objective at this point.  A new religion emerges on fiscal responsibility that hardly peeped over the last decade, and appears to be mainly obstructionist instead of responsible.  </p>
<p>Looks to be the time the battle intensifies.  Dean Baker, Bruce Webb, Barkley Rosser, PGL, Arne, and others need to pull together on this one for Social Security.  I will join the Republican Party to make it a bi-partisan group. (sarcasm?)</p>

<p>Fiscal conservatives begin push over entitlements</p>
<blockquote><p>(CNN) – As the Senate debates spending measures in President Obama’s stimulus bill, a non-partisan group launched a million-dollar ad campaign Wednesday to urge the new administration to create a task force to tackle rising entitlements costs.</p>
<p>The Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an institution dedicated to fighting wasteful government spending, printed ads in the Washington Post and Roll Call on Wednesday calling the current financial crisis “just the tip of the iceberg.”</p>
<p>“We must also focus on a much larger yet less visible threat: the $56 trillion in liabilities and unfunded retirement and health care obligations (that’s $483,000 per U.S. household), and the dangerous reliance on foreign lenders, that threaten our ship of state,” says the ad.</p>
<p>The group is asking Obama to appoint a bipartisan task force to deal with the current financial crisis and to fix structural problems with the economy overall. Congressional Democrats like Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota and Rep. Jim Cooper of Tennessee and Republicans like Sen. George Voinovich of Ohio and Rep. Frank Wolf of Virginia will join the group’s president and CEO David Walker for a press conference on Capitol Hill on Thursday to talk about the mission and ad campaign.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the foundation said the group is planning to spend a minimum of a million dollars on the ad campaign launched Wednesday, which will include an ad in the New York Times this week as well as television spots in the near future.</p></blockquote>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2009/02/stimulus-and-auto-bailout-perils-of.html">Robert Reich</a> gets it right.  Here is the post.</p>
<blockquote><p>Do not confuse American companies with American jobs.</p>
<p>The new stimulus bill, for example, requires that the money be used for production in the United States. Foreign governments, along with large U.S. multinationals concerned about possible foreign retaliation, charge this favors American-based companies. That&#8217;s not quite true. Foreign companies are eligible to receive stimulus money for things they make here (as long as the nations where they&#8217;re headquartered have signed the WTO procurement agreement). For example, Alstom, the French engineering company, is eligible to receive stimulus funds for the power turbines it produces in Tennessee; Japan’s Sanyo, for the solar cell parts it makes in Oregon; and French-owned Lucent Technologies, for the high-speed internet components it produces here, as well as the research it does here through its research arm, Bell Labs. On the other hand, U.S. Steel may not be eligible for stimulus money for the steel slabs it casts in Ontario, Canada.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not defending the &#8220;buy American&#8221; provisions of the stimulus bill. I&#8217;m just saying they&#8217;re not the same as &#8220;buy from American companies.&#8221; And although these provisions skate close to protectionism and risk foreign retaliation, at least a case can be made that if American taxpayers are footing the bill in order to create American jobs, the jobs should be created, well, here in America.</p>
<p>The same confusion haunts the debate over the auto bailout. Advocates of bailing out GM and Chrysler, and most likely Ford, say America can’t afford to lose &#8220;its&#8221; auto industry. But this argument leaves out the fact that foreign-owned automakers, already producing cars here in the United States, employ – directly or indirectly – hundreds of thousands of Americans. And at the rate the Big Three are shrinking, and plan to shrink even further &#8212; even if they get bailed out &#8211;foreign automakers may soon be employing more Americans than the Big Three.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Big Three themselves are global. A Pontiac G8 shipped by GM from Australia has less American content than a BMW X5 assembled in the United States. General Motors’ European subsidiaries include Opel and Saab; Ford’s include Volvo.</p>
<p>I’m not arguing against an auto bailout. But it ought to be focused on helping American auto workers rather than helping global auto companies headquartered in America. Why pay the Big Three billions of taxpayer dollars to stay afloat when, even after being bailed out, they cut tens of thousands of American jobs, slash wages, and shrink their American operations into small fractions of what they used to be?</p>
<p>That’s backwards. The auto bailout should help American autoworkers keep their jobs or get new ones that pay almost as well.</p>
<p>Whether it’s stimulus or bailout, policy makers must remember that American companies aren’t the same as American workers – and our first responsibility is to the latter.</p></blockquote>

<p>Reader Laurie sent this note from an NPR Morning Edition.  The following quoted section caught her attention, and she wondered what was wrong with the explanation.  It made me wonder if other readers had similar questions, even though we have covered part of the question of nationalization (as have Roubini and Krugman) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/commonwealth-bank-of-united-states.html%20-">here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/brief-obama-watch.htm">here</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/nationalize-banks-stiglitz-says-yes.html">here</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/spoonful-of-sugar-and-tarp-part-2.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Update:  I also suggest Laurie go <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/02/greg-mankiw-in-favor-of-nationalization.html">here</a> for a thoughtful context on the word &#8216;nationalization&#8217;.</p>
<p>Update 2:  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=02&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=npr_misrepresents_bank_nationa">Dean Baker</a> addresses the issue on NPR rather directly as well. (hat tip reader JLundell)</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100786812">Morning Edition, February 18, 2009</a>·</p>
<blockquote><p>NPR&#8217;s Ari Shapiro asked economist <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chicagogsb.edu/faculty/bio.aspx?person_id=12825569280">Raghuram Rajan</a> of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business what determines whether a bank falls into the category of &#8220;dead men walking.&#8221;</p>
<p>Or should the government just say, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to buy you up so we don&#8217;t have to keep dumping money into you&#8221;?</p>
<p>There is this question of nationalization that keeps coming up. When the government actually owns these banks, it becomes responsible for all the liabilities of the banks. Supposing the government goes in and replaces the equity holders and says now these are government-owned banks. Then the government becomes responsible to all the debt holders who otherwise have made losses. In other words, with a nationalization, what you get is a transfer of wealth from the taxpayer to all the bondholders who earlier were dependent on the private bank to repay them. Now [they] can depend on the full faith and credit of the government to repay them.</p>
<p>Why do so many economists think we should do this now?</p>
<p>Well, I think some of it is driven by the sense that if we don&#8217;t nationalize, then these equity holders in the banks are getting a free ride where the bank can be run with government protection — where the debt of the banks is insured, the equity holders get all the upside, the government gets nothing for it.</p></blockquote>
