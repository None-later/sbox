<p>During a recession, what happens to huge country that depended upon exports for its great leap forward? Massive unemployment&#8230;and riots. TimesOnLine recently did <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article5627687.ece" target="_blank">research</a> on the kind of violent spasm now hitting China: &#8220;Violent Unrest Rocks China.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>
<p>The research was conducted for The Sunday Times over the last two months in three provinces vital to Chinese trade – Guangdong, Zhejiang and Jiangsu. It found that the global economic crisis has scythed through exports and set off dozens of protests that are never mentioned by the state media. </p>
<p>While troubling for the Chinese government, this should strengthen the argument of Premier Wen Jiabao, who will say on a visit to London this week that his country faces enormous problems and cannot let its currency rise in response to American demands.</p></blockquote>
<p>More of the hair that bit the dog.</p>
<p>Having used a peg currency to help it build its export-oriented economy, China, like an old drunk, now is taking another sip to ward off the disastrous hangover. Not healthy, but understandable. As I have said on this blog repeatedly, global growth has to be organic.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yasheng Huang, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said corruption and a deeply flawed model of economic reform had led to a collapse in personal income growth and a wealth gap that could leave China looking like a Latin American economy.</p>
<p>Richard Duncan, a partner at Blackhorse Asset Management in Singapore, has argued that the only way to create consumers is to raise wages to a legal minimum of $5 (£3.50) a day across Asia – a “trickle up” theory. </p></blockquote>
<p>Below is just a sample of the kinds of events occurring throughout the &#8220;three provinces vital to Chinese trade – Guangdong, Zhejiang and Jiangsu.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>Hundreds of workers protested outside the city government so we ordered the boss to settle the back pay and sent police armed with machine-guns to take him to the bank and deliver the money to his workforce that very night,” the official said.</p>
<p>On January 15 there were pitched battles at a textile factory in the nearby city of Dongguan between striking workers and security guards.</p>
<p>On January 16, about 100 auxiliary security officers, known in Chinese as Bao An, staged a street protest after they were sacked by a state-owned firm in Shenzhen, a boom town adjoining Hong Kong.</p>
<p>About 1,000 teachers confronted police on the streets of Yangjiang on January 5, demanding their wages from the local authorities.</p>
<p>In one sample week in late December, 2,000 workers at a Singapore-owned firm in Shanghai held a wage protest and thousands of farmers staged 12 days of mass demonstrations over economic problems outside the city.</p>
<p>All along the coast, angry workers besieged labour offices and government buildings after dozens of factories closed their doors without paying wages and their owners went back to Hong Kong, Taiwan or South Korea. </p></blockquote>
<p>Global growth on both sides of the planet has been ill formed and ill-conceived, a point I have repeatedly made in every way I know how.</p>

                                <p>Megan McArdle <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/02/all_stimulus_all_the_time.php">concludes from &#8220;lowly MBA&#8221; analysis</a> that it is impossible to get a net surplus from public investment.  If lowly MBAs think this, then lowly MBAs faked their way through Introduction to Microeconomics which IIRC was in fact designated Econ 101 at my lowly public university:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;I do not think of spending money to build the bridge as a net increase in the country&#8217;s wealth.  We exchanged money for a bridge worth the money we spent (or so we light-heartedly hope).  One could argue that the bridge would generate more economic value than it cost in taxes and deadweight loss; one could also argue that it will generate less (and Japan has quite a few bridges of this description).  But this is an argument for the bridge, not for bridge-as-stimulus.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>[Added excerpt &#8212; TB:] Assuming that the real interest rate approximates the time preference of said American Taxpayer, and that the bridge is worth exactly what we paid for it, the net economic benefit is zero.  [Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>I will grant that public investment demand curves may not always slope downwards, but let&#8217;s assume arguendo that they can.  That is, you can in principle be a good technocrat, take the set of available public investment projects, and order them by decreasing return on investment.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s consider what projects should be pursued.  If you consider funding only the most beneficial project, the good technocrat may find that the project returns, say, 30 percent annually, while someone may be willing to lend the government money for almost nothing.  [Added TB:] This project is, in effect, worth more than society paid for it.  So the project is approved and we move on to the next project.  That project is by construction less beneficial, and if the supply curve for funds slopes upwards, the funding will cost more, too.  Still, chances are the next project will pass muster, too.  We go on and eventually come to a project where the rate of return is just equal to the cost of funds.  So the marginal project indeed has no (or minimal) net benefit, but all of those &#8220;inframarginal&#8221; projects have positive net benefits even at the interest rate that equates marginal benefits and marginal costs.</p>
<p>The &#8220;economic surplus&#8221; is in fact the whole area between the demand and supply curve to the left of the point where marginal benefit equals marginal costs.  The public benefits to the tune the returns on the inframarginal projects above the interest rate, and lenders benefit as a group because most of them would have been willing to lend money for less than the market interest rate.  This is one of the fundamental results you should learn in introductory micro.  The graph McArdle should have seen at some point is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Economic-surpluses.svg">e.g. here</a>.</p>
<p>Now the advanced economics point, and a practical policy consideration behind <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/crowding-out-and-perils-of.html">this post</a>, is that the bridge-as-stimulus to fill an <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/blogspot/Hzoh/~3/524676849/another-reason-to-avoid-handwringing.html">output gap</a> can be justifiable as a pure helicoptering of money on firms and individuals involved in building the bridge.  Greg Mankiw said so! (*) The bridge as bridge is icing on the cake.</p>
<p>(*) Possibly to his current regret.</p>

                                <p>Those of you who want to argue that something being &#8220;just symbolism&#8221; are invited to consider the fate of &#8220;Aid to Families with Dependent Children.&#8221;</p>
<p>AFDC is clear and precise.  It tells us that we are helping a specific set of people: Families with Dependent Children.  Not just the father and the mother, but the next generation of human capital as well.  The people who are supposed to be the cogs in the engine of capitalism.</p>
<p>A funny thing happened on the way out of &#8220;welfare reform&#8221; (discussed by Robert <a target="blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/welfare-reform-not-disaster.html">here</a> and <a target="blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/welfare-reform-not-disaster-part-ii.html">here</a>): the program got renamed to &#8220;Temporary Assistance for Needy Families.&#8221;  Note that the emphasis is now on the transience of the assistance, and the families are described as &#8220;needy&#8221; before they are families. No mention of children at all; might well be great-grandma and a bunch of septagenerians living on their Social Security checks and whatever they stuffed under the mattress in the manner of <a target="blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/07/02/070702crbo_books_updike?currentPage=all">John Updike&#8217;s father</a>.*</p>
<p>Another &#8220;funny&#8221; thing that happens on the way through welfare reform is that state block grants lead to strange allocations.</p>
<p>There is a version of this in international development; let&#8217;s call it the Easterly Paradox.**  Generally, what you do is look at the aid a country officially received over the past X number of years (X generally >20) and declared with a Harumph! that, if the people had been given that money directly, they would have $XX,XXX each.</p>
<p>What you don&#8217;t bother mentioning is that 85-90% of that money—75% if the country is extremely lucky—went to domestic supppliers of &#8220;intellectual property.&#8221;  That is, it went to U.S. management consulting teams (generally at full retail) who &#8220;taught&#8221; people their method of irrigation or record-keeping or something else that was essential.***</p>
<p>Short version: our foreign aid budget subsidizes domestic firms significantly more than it produces actual foreign aid.</p>
<p>You would think, though, that the same thing would not happen domestically.  But it appears you would be wrong.</p>
<p>Using the recently-released <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab2006_2009.html">Statistical Abstract data</a>, following are graphic displays of the amount of money allocated to TANF that was actually spent as aid from 2003 to 2006. (Click individual graphics to enlarge.)</p>

<p>Note: The following graphic is accurate.  The state of Mississippi in 2004 spent a <em>negative</em> US$7MM on TANF aid.</p>

<p>In summary, for the four years of most recent data, the U.S. has averaged spending less than 50% of the monies allocated to TANF on providing actual Assistance to Needy Families.</p>
<p>The next time someone tells you we spend too much money on helping people, point out that most of that money goes to people who are employed as administrators, counselor, and finance officers.</p>

<p>I argued that the conventional view that welfare reform was a success is based on the coincidence that the economy boomed right after welfare war reformed, the journalists stopped paying attention, not noticing the following increase in severe poverty during the Bush non boom.</p>
<p>Now we are in a severe recession.  How is the reformed welfare system working ?  According to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/02/us/02welfare.html?_r=1">Jason DeParle&#8217;s article in the New York Times</a> it is a disaster.</p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON — Despite soaring unemployment and the worst economic crisis in decades, 18 states cut their welfare rolls last year, and nationally the number of people receiving cash assistance remained at or near the lowest in more than 40 years.</p>
<p>The trends, based on an analysis of new state data collected by The New York Times, raise questions about how well a revamped welfare system with great state discretion is responding to growing hardships.</p></blockquote>
<p>DeParle doesn&#8217;t theorize, but I can&#8217;t help guessing that states are tossing people off welfare, because they are under budgetary pressure and the very poor are very politically weak.  Some might believe that TANF should be eliminated, but I don&#8217;t see how anyone can defend the present system which gives less assistance when there is more need and presses people harder to get jobs when it is much more nearly impossible for them to find them.</p>
<p>DeParle does note that &#8220;The economic stimulus bills pending in Congress would provide matching grants — estimated at $2.5 billion over two years — to states with caseload expansions.&#8221;  Oh wow, if matched by state funds that would be even more than $600 per year per recipient.  Time to open a cadillac dealership.</p>

<p>Wow an argument in favor of protection from Paul Krugman.  I never expected to read that.  Now he&#8217;s against protection all the same, but he does admit that there is a good argument that right now a bit of protection would be good for the world.  </p>
<p>The argument, basically, is that governments aren&#8217;t coordinating macro policy and that, if stimuli spill out, then they won&#8217;t stimulate enough so everyone will be better off if every country keeps its stimulus to itself.  He concludes however, that protection would be a bad policy, because once countries start they don&#8217;t stop so a little bit of protection right now is not an option.  Anyway it&#8217;s brief so <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/protectionism-and-stimulus-wonkish/">read it.</a></p>
<p>Nick Rowe has <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2009/02/paul-krugman-implicitly-assumes-fixed-exchange-rates.html">an interesting counter argument</a>.  He argues that if all countries are in a liquidity trap, then fiscal stimuli don&#8217;t spill over.  </p>
<p>According to Krugman &#8220;His argument is based on the proposition that since interest rates are fixed under a liquidity trap, capital flows are fixed, and the exchange rate will adjust to offset any change in the trade balance.&#8221;  I will comment on this alleged argument.  Rowe&#8217;s post refers to a paper which I haven&#8217;t read.  Actually the post seems less sophisticated than Krugman&#8217;s presentation, as Rowe seems to argue that flexible exchange rates always imply balanced trade. He can&#8217;t be arguing that, and I haven&#8217;t read the paper.</p>
<p>The argument that this is true specifically if we are in a liquidity trap seems to be specific to Rowe as presented by Krugman.</p>
<p>Rowe&#8217;s argument as presented by Krugman seems backward to me (from now on &#8220;he&#8221; means Rowe as presented by Krugman).  Basically he seems to be arguing that demand for say 3 month t-bills is very elastic and so the price of 3 month t-bills won&#8217;t change and so the amount of 3 month t-bills in investors&#8217; portfolios won&#8217;t change &#8212; that is he is going from the assumption  people are willing to shift huge amounts of wealth into 3 month t-bills to the conclusion that people won&#8217;t shift any wealth into t-bills.  </p>
<p>I repeat this argument in various ways after the jump.</p>
<p>The evidence that we are in a liquidity trap is simply that short safe rates are approximately zero.  However, the application in macro models is the assumption that, therefore, safe short term interest rates won&#8217;t increase if more short term public bonds are issued.  That seems to me to be the same as the assumption that people and firms are willing to buy much more of them.  </p>
<p>For some reason, Rowe assumes that this applies only to domestic people and firms and that whatever makes investors so eager to buy short term public debt is confined nation by nation.  Not to put to fine a point on it, this strikes me as absolutely absurd given, for example the fact that UBS is endangered by the US real estate bubble and that AIG was brought down by its London office.  </p>
<p>The argument is interest rates are fixed because a miniscule change in interest rates would cause a huge flow therefore changes in interest rates will be miniscule therefore flows will be miniscule.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d say this is  a case of the dear old Mundell Fleming model overcoming common sense as if it were an RBC model.</p>
<p>The same goes for the anchoring model.  </p>
<p>s = sbar + (i*-i)/k</p>
<p>s is the exchange rate, sbar a steady state exchange rate determined long after the recession and stimulus are over, i domestic interest, i* foreign interest rate and k a constant.  </p>
<p> Krugman assumes that k is constant which, for one thing, implies  that capital flows are linear in interest rates.  Does that assumption seem reasonable right now ?  seems to me that an interest rate fluctuating between 0 and 10 basis points is a strong time that k is a bit low right now.</p>
<p>However I guess k doesn&#8217;t matter to Krugman.  I guess that Krugman&#8217;s argument amounts to saying that with constant interest rates, bonds become perfect substitutes so the amounts of different bonds that people will hold (tried to avoid writing &#8220;stock of bonds&#8221; there) can change a lot and balance large trade deficits at a fixed relative price.  That is Krugman is ahead of me as <strike>usual</strike> always so far.</p>

<p>Which pot is calling which kettle black? The &#8220;Made in America&#8221; has caused quite a stir among vested interest groups, among them China and a number of our industries now profiting from Chinese steel, i.e., Caterpillar.</p>
<p>The whole mess is quite a chuckle. Trade war? Well, in case you haven&#8217;t notice, the trade war has been waging from some time now. And, if you do not know how a command economy works, now is the time to don your reading hat, pull out your pipe, and settle down before a cozy winter fire.</p>
<p>A U.S. president has finally recognized the fact, even if many in Congress do not, i.e., those now receiving considerable financial support from American companies now profiting from that war. (Lobbies are such a tangled web.)</p>
<p>Before we jump too quickly into the fray, we should look the ways in which China subsidizes its own steel industry. The U.S. steel industry has put out an interesting <a href="http://www.sfsa.org/sfsa/news/2006/Chinese%20Steel%20Subsidies%20Paper.pdf" target="_blank">document</a> on how China subsidizes its own steel industry. Whoa, you say&#8230;obviously this document is not to be trusted.</p>
<p>Well, maybe. Some of its assertions should be scutinzed.</p>
<blockquote><p>China has the world’s largest steel industry. Indeed, in 2005, China made more steel than the next four largest producers combined. From 2000 to 2005, China’s steel production increased by over 170 percent, as the Chinese industry added capacity at a furious rate. Between 1998 and 2005, China’s steel exports more than quadrupled, as China established itself as one of the world’s leading exporters. This explosive growth in both production and exports would not have been possible without the support of the Chinese government.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now for the lessons in how a command economy works.</p>
<p>Lesson 1: A command economy actually owns many of the industries that it considers critical not only to its development but also to its control of the market place. Does that give those government own entities an edge over foreign rivals? Indeed it does. On to Lesson 2.</p>
<p>Lesson 2: Laws can be easily fashioned to give not only direct subsidies, cash and land grants, but also prefrential tax treat to all steel companies inside China. These can be in the form of export tax rebates and discounted interest rates in loans, debt to equity swaps, preferential loas&#8230;to name only a few. In short, China can write the laws governing those industries. And, wildly enough, because those laws apply to steel industriesinside China, those laws do not violate WTO principles! The question to ask now is: Can foreign steel manufacturers set up shop in China&#8211;or can they have a controlling interest in any steel making industry inside China. On to Lesson 3.</p>
<p>Lesson 3: As of 2005, China <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-07/14/content_460123.htm" target="_blank">prohibited</a>any foreign company from having a controlling stake in domestic steel companies.<br />
<blockquote>The nation will forbid foreign steel producers from taking controlling stakes in domestic steel companies, Qi Xiangdong, deputy secretary general of China Iron and Steel Association, said yesterday.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, you say, did not we do the same in the Dubai Ports flap? Steel is not quite the same as a port of entry, but if you wish to push this point, so be it. Here is the tricky part, however. China will allow foreign companies to have some interest in its domestic firms, but there is a catch. They must have independent technologies for the production of steel. &#8220;Come into my trap,&#8221; said the cat, &#8220;and bring your own cheese. Oh, you have much nicer cheese! Can we use that, too?&#8221;</p>
<p>There are numerous other ways in which a command economy can give advantages to its state-own firms. While the U.S. steel document enumerates many, I would like to settle on a few, so that we can see how a command economy works.</p>
<p>Lesson 4:: Export restrictions can be placed on key materials so that the cost of making a product&#8211;for example, steel&#8211;can be kept low. China has placed <a href="http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200506/24/eng20050624_192076.html" target="_blank">export restrictions</a> on coke, a critical product for the making of steel.</p>
<p>Lesson 5:Through <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/bizchina/2008-12/12/content_7299463.htm" target="_blank">export tax rebates</a>, a command economy can give significant advantage to those industries it wishes grow globally:</p>
<blockquote><p>China is considering increasing export tax rebates on certain steel products to help the industry, which is one of the worst hit by the growing international financial turmoil.<br />Minister of Industry and Information Technology Li Yizhong today told a press conference that the ministry is considering encouraging exports of high-end steel products by increasing export tax rebates. However, the ministry will continue limiting exports of high energy-intensive steel products.<br />At the same time, the government will also help steel enterprises upgrade technologies with discounted loans next year. China&#8217;s steel makers are suffering both from high prices for raw materials and from falling product prices.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, Virginia, there is a trade war.</p>
<p>Lesson 6: Be careful when you hear different pots call different kettles black. And I never even mentioned currency manipulation. Or energy subsidies! Think of that!</p>

                                <p>Well the true colors are beginning to show. Navarrette is a San Diego columnist whose work appears on CNN.com. His stimulus piece is called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/02/navarrette.stimulus/index.html">Ridiculous Items in Stimulus Plan</a> Out of the whole plan which items stood out for our man Ruben?<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;d settle for removing more of the ridiculous items that House Democrats slipped into the legislation to advance their sociopolitical agenda. Like $350 million for child care on military bases. Or $335 million to prevent sexually transmitted diseases.</p>
<p>In normal economic times, there might not be anything wrong with this. But these aren&#8217;t normal times. And these politically motivated giveaways do nothing to fight the recession.</p>
<p>Another such item, which was removed from the bill, was a plan to spend more than $200 million on birth control funding as a way of stimulating the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p> Now I don&#8217;t agree with his economic argument and I&#8217;ll get to that component after the jump. But first lets do some addition: $350 million + $335 million + $200 million = $885 million. Or about <s>1%</s> .1% of the bill emerging from the Senate. Even if we accepted the idea that these programs were just Democratic pork (and I don&#8217;t not even in the context of stimulus) are there really people out there who would just walk away from the deal because a relatively small of money goes to child care, or to prevent STD, or to fund family planning?</p>
<p>This is not an economic argument, the success or failure of the stimulus package is not going to ride on less than a billion dollars either way. Instead it seems purely focused on achieving the right&#8217;s ideological agenda. Because really what he is mainly bitching about is the condoms. If it comes to a choice of you preventing transmission of an incurable viral infection by using a condom or you risking everything by going unprotected Ruben would chose the latter. Or just urge you not to have sex at all.</p>
<p>And yet they argue that it is Democrats who are inserting ideology into this? Bollocks. Plus his economic argument is stupid. Details on that below the fold.</p>
<p>Most working families struggle with the issue of child care. Sometimes the work schedules are such that responsibilities can be passed off between the spouses. Say with work from home dad taking over during the day while mom is at work. Or sometimes there are relatives available to pick up some of the slack, say if the work/commute hours overlap somewhat. But often as not the options reduce themselves to child care or not working at all. And paying for quality child care is likely to make a lot of workers net pay go to sub-minimum wage level.</p>
<p>Okay if I wanted to pick an example of a single spouse who was not able to trade parental responsibilities off, was far from relatives, had a lot of difficulty living on the relatively small paycheck of the working spouse and so needed to get a job to maintain an acceptable family life-style whose face would I see on the poster? Well the wife of a junior enlisted service member living on a military base far from home whose husband just left for Iraq or Afghanistan. And what single thing would prevent her from going out and getting that job? Lack of available child care.</p>
<p>Would the government net out ahead on taxes by freeing up this labor pool? Maybe not though certainly they would get some back. Moreover these new workers would be piling up quarters in the Social Security system and buying stuff at the Post Exchange (where the profits largely go to recreation and family welfare anyway). I am not sure why Navarrette focused in on this line item in the first place. Not only is his argument economically dubious he is basically spitting in the face of the military itself. It is hard to put this down as anything other than adversion to government social spending in general.</p>
<p>So lets look at family planning. Does the nation need future workers? Well yes. Do those kids add to national productivity or family income in the meantime? Well no, it takes a lot of money to feed, clothe and educate a kid for a couple of decades. Moreover it takes people out of the labor pool for months and years. So how did Navarrette respond when Nancy Pelosi made this case in a reasonable way?<br />
<blockquote>When ABC&#8217;s George Stephanopolous asked Pelosi to explain how birth control helps the economy, here&#8217;s what the speaker said: &#8220;The family planning services reduce cost. They reduce cost. The states are in terrible fiscal budget crises now, and part of what we do for children&#8217;s health, education and some of those elements are to help the states meet their financial needs. One of those &#8212; one of the initiatives you mentioned, the contraception, will reduce costs to the states and to the federal government.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Navarrette turned around and tried to connect her to the Eugenics movement of the early 20th century<br />
<blockquote>For a minute, it sounded as if the House speaker was channeling the ghost of Margaret Sanger. The 20th-century birth control advocate is a hero to those who worship at the altar of reproductive freedom. She even founded the American Birth Control League, which became Planned Parenthood.</p>
<p>But there is more. Sanger also embraced birth control as a means of social engineering. She was a leader in the eugenics movement, which had a number of influential supporters.</p>
<p>Many in that school of thought considered immigrant groups like Jews, Italians and Irish to be inferior genetically, and they felt that these groups were having too many children, a trend they believed needed to be stopped &#8212; by forced sterilization if necessary.</p></blockquote>
<p> Yep that Nancy Pelosi, just a racist wanting to keep the browns down. This is kind of a sick play of the race card by Senor Navarrette (who writes very often on minority issues) and seems to have been done with malice aforethought.</p>
<p>As to the remaining piece of &#8216;ridiculous&#8217; spending, it is not clear if his opposition to preventing STDs is just his Catholicism talking (because he is pretty open about his faith) or just based on some uncomfort about &#8216;teh gay&#8217;. But either way claiming that infectious diseases are not a direct drag on productivity is to me nonsense. And even if you believed they were not why not oppose the substantial amounts in the bill to prevent bird flu?</p>
<p>I suspect there are some AB readers who are thinking in exasperation &#8216;He is just one columnist&#8217;. Well he is a fairly prominent one and a good example of how the arguments against the stimulus bill are despite protestations largely not economic at all. Some people just don&#8217;t like their government spending money on social programs.</p>

                                <p>Paul Krugman writes about &#8220;Vanishing Dark Matter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Robert Waldmann waxes nostalgic.</p>
<p>Ah memories.  Brad DeLong and I recall an impromptu debate on dark matter at 1050 Mass ave (NBER) featuring Paul Krugman and Larry Summers (apparently just back from advising Dukakis &#8212; some memories aren&#8217;t as pleasant as others).</p>
<p>googling (krugman, summers, nber, &#8230; &#8220;anything at all&#8221;) at Brad&#8217;s blog is totally pointless.  I can only hope that in my whole life I write as much as Brad has written on (krugman, summers, nber, &#8230; &#8220;anything at all&#8221;) .</p>
<p>The scene is that, according to the official statistics, the US has just become a net debtor (or the world&#8217;s number 1 net debtor, the US went from 0 to deeper in the hole than any nation had ever been so fast that my head spun (was net debtor see below)).  Summers argued that the book value net position was irrelevant since net US capital income was still positive.</p>
<p>Krugman said (and I quote from memory) &#8220;well you have to consider that the reason that we have a higher return on our assets is that many of them are FDI so it&#8217;s not clear if it is really capital income or fees for insurance and management services.  And if people are smart enough to understand that, then they are smart enough to know that zero isn&#8217;t an especially important number.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ah yes.  &#8220;zero isn&#8217;t an especially important number&#8221; up there with &#8220;accidental theorist&#8221; as a demolition of people who don&#8217;t want to bother with math (including arithmetic).  </p>
<p>Other good lines.   On the other side of the discussion </p>
<p>Larry Summers &#8212; &#8220;Real analysis &#8212; isn&#8217;t that mostly about the difference between less than and less than or equal to ?&#8221;</p>
<p>Larry Summers &#8212; &#8220;You do know about the concept of present value and its implications&#8221; (subtle but it means that knowing dynamic programming is just knowing what &#8220;present value&#8221; means).</p>
<p>Robert Barro &#8212; &#8220;Sometimes a negative cite is more useful than a positive cite &#8212; just speaking from casual empiricisms&#8221; (means I was <a href="http://www.google.it/search?hl=it&#038;q=fukayaming&#038;btnG=Cerca+con+Google&#038;meta=&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=">Fukayaming</a> when I wrote &#8220;Are government bonds net wealth&#8221;)</p>
<p>Robert Barro &#8212; &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there an existence result that there is a second best argument for everything.&#8221;  (means we should assume that the market outcome is the first best or we would have to admit that economic theory will not be useful to policy makers until it is empirically grounded.  That is, better bad advice than no advice.  Also a true statement.  The proof is trivial).</p>
<p>By popular demand by commenter<strike>s</strike> I try to slow it down by farking the Profs after the jump.</p>

<p>[sounds pretty clear to me.   It is hard to tell if profits sent to the USA from a foreign subsidiary are return on capital or the fruit of the brilliant guidance coming from the US CEO (this was a longggg time ago).  In general risky returns are higher, but they are risky.  The US has been getting net income from the rest of the world, because our investments are risky.  Krugman recently quotes one Gian Maria Milesi-Feretti (who had the dubious pleasure of being a TA along with me once) who claims the USA just took a 2 trillion net capital loss.  You can think you are doing fine if you are bearing risk and lucky so far.  The point was that returns on US investments abroad are highe than on foreign investments in the USA for a reason and it isn&#8217;t that they love us so much that they are throwing money at us]</p>
<p>And if people are smart enough to understand that, then they are smart enough to know that zero isn&#8217;t an especially important number.&#8221;</p>
<p>[Many people think they can get away with thinking of quanties as &#8220;Positive negative and zero&#8221;  in this case net debtor, net creditor or neither.  Sometimes the difference between -1 and 1 is about as important as the difference between 1,000,000 and 1,000,002.  This is very confusing to people who don&#8217;t like numbers.  I discuss an extreme example here</p>
<p>http://tinyurl.com/cuecq6.  very very often &#8220;zero isn&#8217;t an especially important number&#8221; is a devastating counter argument to an innumerate argument.</p>
<p>Ah yes. &#8220;zero isn&#8217;t an especially important number&#8221; up there with &#8220;accidental theorist&#8221; as a demolition of people who don&#8217;t want to bother with math (including arithmetic).</p>
<p>Other good lines. On the other side of the discussion</p>
<p>Larry Summers &#8212; &#8220;Real analysis &#8212; isn&#8217;t that mostly about the difference between less than and less than or equal to ?&#8221;</p>
<p>[the difference between open and closed sets is very important in real analysis.  An example of an open set is the set of real numbers less than zero.  An example of a closed set is the set of real numbers less than or equal to zero.  That difference is of very little importance if the number in question (here zero to remind people of Krugman) is really important for some reason.  However, the concepts are very useful in doing math which is very useful to physicists, chemists and Engineers and which has had a huge influence on economists.]</p>
<p>Larry Summers &#8212; &#8220;You do know about the concept of present value and its implications&#8221; (subtle but it means that knowing dynamic programming is just knowing what &#8220;present value&#8221; means).</p>
<p>[I said it was subtle.  The point is that Fresh Water macroeconmists think that a mathematical technique called dyanmic programming is the belly button of the universe or at least of macroeconomics.  They think the point of the first semester of a graduate macro course is to teach about this technique (and complain if they have to teach the second semester and I taught the first).  The key idea is the &#8220;value function&#8221; which gives the maximum present value of some stream of income or pleasure or whatever you want as a function of the state (or maximum expected present value if there is uncertainty).</p>
<p>So one can argue that if you know about present value, you can handle dynamic programming.</p>
<p>Frankly, I didn&#8217;t notice any difficulty in dynamic programming when I first encountered it.  In fact the hard part is proving the existence of a value function and the natural thing to do is to just assume one exists.  This works for all problems which can be solved by dynamic programming.</p>
<p>Robert Barro &#8212; &#8220;Sometimes a negative cite is more useful than a positive cite &#8212; just speaking from casual empiricisms&#8221; (means I was Fukayaming when I wrote &#8220;Are government bonds net wealth&#8221;)</p>
<p>The &#8220;casual empiricism&#8221; means look at me, I&#8217;m a superstar because so many people lined up to criticize my papers.  Also I am hinting that I knew that they would and wrote the papers to make sure that famous people would feel obliged to criticize me and I would get lots of citations.  This is called Fukayaming because the most successful effort ever was Francis Fukayama&#8217;s &#8220;The End of History&#8221; which made everything historic that happened everywhere a refutation of Fukayama who was cited continuously and became very famous.</p>
<p>OK Barro wrote that paper on Ricardian equivalence.  The paper included 10 or so footnotes explaining why Ricardian equivalence is not likely.  For each footnote there was at least one paper in a top journal presented as a counter argument to Barro.  He got a citation and could note that he had already said that. </p>
<p>When someone praises you, it might mean your friend has cited you.  When someone criticizes you it means you have scared your adversaries. </p>
<p>A reasonable scam is for two friends to stage a furious academic debate citing each other along the way. ]</p>
<p>Robert Barro &#8212; &#8220;Isn&#8217;t there an existence result that there is a second best argument for everything.&#8221; (means we should assume that the market outcome is the first best or we would have to admit that economic theory will not be useful to policy makers until it is empirically grounded. That is, better bad advice than no advice. Also a true statement. The proof is trivial).</p>
<p>[in fact the core asumptions of economics like say rational utility maximisation can&#8217;t have any implications without some assumptions about utility functions.  The trivial proof is insane policy would be optimal if people are made very very happy by the knoweledge that it was implimented (not the effects just knowing it was done).  Barro&#8217;s point, which is also valid is that there are people like Stiglitz who can basically always fit the assumptions around the policy so the fact that they can write a model where it is optimal tells us nothing.  I agree, but I also think that the mathematical result that lump sum transfers then laissez faire is optimal in a general equilibrium model with asymmetric information complete markets perfect competition and no spillovers is optimal is equally worthless.]</p>

<p>Things to Do About Taxes When You&#8217;re President</p>
<p>Every time we have a new President, we are treated to a new spectacle of people nominated to high office who have made questionable decisions.  The new administration is not any different than its predecessors in this regard. </p>
<p>Often, the questionable decisions involve taxes, more specifically non-payment of taxes owed.  I&#8217;ve had a few posts indicating that you can&#8217;t trust the IRS&#8217; Statistics of Income very far because people at the top rungs of the income scale can easily hide that income from the IRS, and of course, it doesn&#8217;t seem like anyone nominated to an exalted position comes from anything other than the top rungs of the income scale.   Best and the brightest and all that, but many of the best and the brightest are, in fact, corrupt.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s call it like it is:  neither Geithner nor Daschle would have ever &#8220;realized&#8221; that they owed taxes if they hadn&#8217;t been nominated to &#8220;serve&#8221; in Obama&#8217;s cabinet.  And of course, Obama doesn&#8217;t care that they are, ahem, forgetful, cough cough, or they&#8217;d already have been booted.  But the fact that this kind of thing seems to come up so often should at least be a tip-off to anyone who might care that tax evasion is a big industry.  </p>
<p>At a time of record deficits, at a time when faith in the sort of people who have the wherewithal to engage in this sort of behavior is low, at a time when financial shenanigans have brought the country down, perhaps this could suggest something to our new President:  its long past time to crack down on this sort of behavior. </p>
<p>Improved tax enforcement, particularly aimed the type of folks from whom we&#8217;ve seen tax evasion in the past  (i.e., those who either don&#8217;t get a W-2, or who get some sort of interesting and oddball perks) could raise a lot of money.  It might even increase the public&#8217;s faith in government.  Finding scofflaws is probably not difficult; I imagine if Obama had the IRS take a quick look at folks on the short list for his administration and those of his predecessors, he&#8217;ll find a bunch of them.  </p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not holding my breath.  <br />____________________________________<br />by cactus</p>
