                                <p>I was pontificating earlier today about how many of the now-unemployed Financial Services workers were, in a previous life, engineers of one stripe or another, and if we&#8217;re going to be doing things with the stimulus bill such as re-engineer the power grid, some of them may well decide to return to their previous life. And with a 60% increase in the number of people unemployed since May of 2007, there should be some decent competition.</p>
<p>Leave it to my old friend <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/opinion/l05econ.html?_r=1&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=Bisson&#038;st=cse">Terry Bisson to completely undermine that argument</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I think the big Wall Street bonuses are a fine idea.</p>
<p>Without them, Wall Streeters will all look for other jobs. Do we really want these greedy incompetent clowns building our houses, teaching our children or driving our cabs?</p></blockquote>

<p>Especially like this:</p>
<p>Mankiw: The CEA website should also post a notice about CEA internships, as we had during my tenure as CEA chair, so students can find out how to apply.</p>
<p>DeLong: &#8220;Let me, for one, state that I am very glad that Christie Romer has been too busy since her confirmation a week ago Wednesday night to set up procedures for hiring interns. When setting up and posting procedures on the hiring of interns is the most valuable first use of a CEA chair&#8217;s time, there is indeed cause for alarm: it would be a sign that the president is like George W. Bush, who would rather not have had any economic advice at all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I note for the record that the CBO sent out their Summer Internship application notice on January 27th.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By now, it&#8217;s clear to everyone that we have inherited an economic crisis as deep and dire as any since the days of the Great Depression. Millions of jobs that Americans relied on just a year ago are gone; millions more of the nest eggs families worked so hard to build have vanished. People everywhere are worried about what tomorrow will bring. </p>
<p>What Americans expect from Washington is action that matches the urgency they feel in their daily lives &#8212; action that&#8217;s swift, bold and wise enough for us to climb out of this crisis. </p>
<p>Because each day we wait to begin the work of turning our economy around, more people lose their jobs, their savings and their homes. And if nothing is done, this recession might linger for years. Our economy will lose 5 million more jobs. Unemployment will approach double digits. Our nation will sink deeper into a crisis that, at some point, we may not be able to reverse. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I feel such a sense of urgency about the recovery plan before Congress. With it, we will create or save more than 3 million jobs over the next two years, provide immediate tax relief to 95 percent of American workers, ignite spending by businesses and consumers alike, and take steps to strengthen our country for years to come. </p>
<p>This plan is more than a prescription for short-term spending &#8212; it&#8217;s a strategy for America&#8217;s long-term growth and opportunity in areas such as renewable energy, health care and education. And it&#8217;s a strategy that will be implemented with unprecedented transparency and accountability, so Americans know where their tax dollars are going and how they are being spent. </p>
<p>In recent days, there have been misguided criticisms of this plan that echo the failed theories that helped lead us into this crisis &#8212; the notion that tax cuts alone will solve all our problems; that we can meet our enormous tests with half-steps and piecemeal measures; that we can ignore fundamental challenges such as energy independence and the high cost of health care and still expect our economy and our country to thrive. </p>
<p>I reject these theories, and so did the American people when they went to the polls in November and voted resoundingly for change. They know that we have tried it those ways for too long. And because we have, our health-care costs still rise faster than inflation. Our dependence on foreign oil still threatens our economy and our security. Our children still study in schools that put them at a disadvantage. We&#8217;ve seen the tragic consequences when our bridges crumble and our levees fail. </p>
<p>Every day, our economy gets sicker &#8212; and the time for a remedy that puts Americans back to work, jump-starts our economy and invests in lasting growth is now. </p>
<p>Now is the time to protect health insurance for the more than 8 million Americans at risk of losing their coverage and to computerize the health-care records of every American within five years, saving billions of dollars and countless lives in the process. </p>
<p>Now is the time to save billions by making 2 million homes and 75 percent of federal buildings more energy-efficient, and to double our capacity to generate alternative sources of energy within three years. </p>
<p>Now is the time to give our children every advantage they need to compete by upgrading 10,000 schools with state-of-the-art classrooms, libraries and labs; by training our teachers in math and science; and by bringing the dream of a college education within reach for millions of Americans. </p>
<p>And now is the time to create the jobs that remake America for the 21st century by rebuilding aging roads, bridges and levees; designing a smart electrical grid; and connecting every corner of the country to the information superhighway.</p>
<p>These are the actions Americans expect us to take without delay. They&#8217;re patient enough to know that our economic recovery will be measured in years, not months. But they have no patience for the same old partisan gridlock that stands in the way of action while our economy continues to slide. </p>
<p>So we have a choice to make. We can once again let Washington&#8217;s bad habits stand in the way of progress. Or we can pull together and say that in America, our destiny isn&#8217;t written for us but by us. We can place good ideas ahead of old ideological battles, and a sense of purpose above the same narrow partisanship. We can act boldly to turn crisis into opportunity and, together, write the next great chapter in our history and meet the test of our time. </p>
<p>The writer is president of the United States. </p>

                                <p>Up to now most of the numbers used in the Pick your Pork series have been drawn from the initial House version of the bill. But now the action has moved to the Senate and it is time to shift our ground in response. So lets develop some links.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=205">CBO Director&#8217;s Blog: Macroeconomic Effects of the Senate Stimulus Legislation</a><br />
<blockquote>CBO estimates that the Senate legislation would raise output by between 1.4 percent and 4.1 percent by the fourth quarter of 2009; by between 1.2 percent and 3.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2010; and by between 0.4 percent and 1.2 percent by the fourth quarter of 2011. CBO estimates that the legislation would raise employment by 0.9 million to 2.5 million at the end of 2009; 1.3 million to 3.9 million at the end of 2010; and 0.6 million to 1.9 million at the end of 2011.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=204">CBO Cost Estimate: Summary</a><br />
<blockquote>CBO estimates that if enacted in mid-February, H.R. 1 as amended would increase outlays by $132 billion during the remaining several months of fiscal year 2009, by $242 billion in fiscal year 2010, by $145 billion in 2011, and by a total of $632 billion over the 2009-2019 period. In addition, CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that enacting the proposed Senate amendment to H.R. 1 would reduce revenues by $101 billion in fiscal year 2009, by $219 billion in fiscal year 2010, and by a net amount of $253 billion over the 2009-2019 period. (Approximately $96 billion of the estimated revenue change is attributable to the proposed tax credit for wage earners and $70 billion to the proposed changes in the AMT.)</p>
<p>Combining those effects, CBO estimates that enacting the Senate amendment would increase federal budget deficits by $233 billion over the remaining months of fiscal year 2009, by $461 billion in 2010, by $142 billion in 2011, and by about $884 billion over over the 2009-2019 period.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the meanwhile: Pick your Pork!</p>
<p>(Update. Though it should be clear enough from the formatting none of these numbers are mine. The text in blockquotes has just been cut and pasted right from the original CBO documents.)</p>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s time to reread the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html">World Bank report</a> on what creates wealth because it seems that the arguments against the stimulus are from a mind-set of very narrow thinking about what creates wealth.  They all seem focused on what the World Bank report calls “Produced Capital”.   Unfortunately, focusing on just that aspect of capital reduces our nation to growth based on 18% of our economic power.  And, as far as I have understood the arguments for tax cuts, they are based on effecting this small aspect of what produces wealth in a developed economy like ours.  <br />
<blockquote>“The rest of the story is intangible capital. <strong>That encompasses raw labor; human capital, which includes the sum of a population&#8217;s knowledge and skills; and the level of trust in a society and the quality of its formal and informal institutions.</strong> Worldwide, the study finds, &#8220;natural capital accounts for 5 percent of total wealth, produced capital for 18 percent, and intangible capital 77 percent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You know what that is?  Democratic traditional spending priorities.  <br />
<blockquote>“Rich countries are largely rich because of the skills of their populations and the quality of the institutions supporting economic activity,&#8221; the study concludes. According to Hamilton&#8217;s figures, the rule of law explains 57 percent of countries&#8217; intangible capital. Education accounts for 36 percent.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Get that?  It means tax cuts are just stupid policy if the goal is to stimulate a developed economy as strongly as possible such that the stimulus creates lasting wealth.  Is that not the complaint by the republicans and blue dogs, the lack of lasting wealth which means jobs as the stimulus is written?  What the World Bank report means is, if you want the biggest bang for your greenback, you have to weigh the heavy side of the stimulus to  invest in <em>“human capital, which includes the sum of a population&#8217;s knowledge and skills; and the level of trust in a society and the quality of its formal and informal institutions.”  </em></p>
<p>You have to load the stimulus to the 77% side and not the 23% side (natural 5% and produced capital 18%).   That is 3.4 human capital to 1 natural/produced capital.   That means education (all forms and subjects), support for the economically disadvantaged (welfare, medicaid), health care (medicare, national health payment reform, system IT), risk prevention and recovery (law, fire/rescue, FEMA), science (greening energy, environment)  and the arts (art districts, museums) to suggest a few. </p>
<p>Beyond that, the intentional campaign to sway public opinion by purposefully lying about the way a stimulus such as is being proposed will function, is to actually predestine our efforts to failure. The reason is because the campaign is producing a lack of trust.<br />
<blockquote>“An economy with a very efficient judicial system, clear and enforceable property rights, and an effective <strong>and uncorrupt government will produce higher total wealth</strong>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As noted above, the level of trust in a society of its institutions is of issue regarding the level of capital available to produce wealth.   The greatest harm that is coming from the republican&#8217;s drive to instill their minority will on the many out of selfish want, is to further the demise of the people&#8217;s trust.  For the blue dogs it is their ignorance of their economic ideology that creates the mistrust.  The republicans/blue dogs, and those helping them by lending their &#8220;professionalism&#8221;, think they are only effecting a political strategy.  In truth, they are destroying the very basis for the wealth they desire.  Their entire campaign for decades to discredit, to instill mistrust in the primary institution we have, the US (We the People) government, has been the primary cause to our economic decline.  To increase the level of distrust is to decrease the available “intangible capital” which is  77% of our wealth generating power.   </p>
<p>Pushing tax cuts, dear republicans and blue dogs, is actually working against the economic goal you profess to desire for the American people because enacting tax cuts promotes the weakest power of our economy while the promoting of tax cuts is destroying the strongest power of our economy. </p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Thinks that <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/02/the-great-multiplier-debate.html">this post by Mark Thoma</a> discussing <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2009/02/why_canat_we_al.html">this Post by Menzie Chinn </a>is unusually excellent.  I suggest you go read it.  If interested my thoughts on it after the jump.</p>
<p>ideology. Its just not done to write that the debate is ideologues on one side non-ideologues on the other.  In fact, he lists two ideologies.  However they are both anti-stimulus bill ideologies. </p>
<p>Furthermore they go together not just in congress but in the economics profession.  The debate among economists prominently included the views of people who think government spending is horrible (except they don&#8217;t complain about defense spending) and the market is perfect so it should be left alone and whose views haven&#8217;t been noticibly affected by the recent downturn.</p>
<p>I think the form of Chinn&#8217;s sentence suggests extreme reluctance to say this but, among economists, there are hard core ideologues on one side of the debate and not the other (which isn&#8217;t to say all stimulus critics are hard core ideologues).</p>
<p>Chinn might get himself in trouble by saying RBC models can&#8217;t fit moments, but I doubt anyone will notice the deadliness of the line &#8220;even H-P filtered.&#8221;  He briefly mentions an extreme weakness of RBC models.  The data are H-P filtered markedly reducing variances and covariances, the output of the models are not H.P. filtered.</p>
<p>In my personal experience it is hard to fit the moments  H.P. filetered data, but it is much harder if the output of the model must be run through an H.P: filter too.  Is there any excuse for not running the output of models through H.P. filters.</p>
<p>Let me quote Tom Sargent &#8220;Ed Prescott thinks growth theory should be used to study everything but growth.&#8221; It is very very strange that stationary growth models are written and compared to H.P.filtered data.  Wouldn&#8217;t it be more natural to write down a growing growth model then H.P. filter it and compare it to H.P. filtered data ?</p>
<p>Third point.  Chinn asserts that parameters are chosen so the model&#8217;s output fits the data.  Prescott claims that parameters are not chosen so the model&#8217;s output fits the data, but rather based on independent data (micro data and trends),  Chinn confidently asserts that, when Prescott claimed this, he lied.  </p>
<p>Now on multipliers from RBC and DSGE models.  An assumption of many of these models is that aggregate consumption corresponds to that of a rational  representative consumer with no liquidity constraint.  This is a feature, an important part of the GE ness.</p>
<p>It also implies that tax shifts affect output only via incentives on the supply side, that is, that a multiplier is zero.  So, sure they are not suited to the evaluation of a proposed stimulus involving tax cuts and deficit spending. </p>
<p>But what was the advantage of this assumption ?  The models certainly don&#8217;t fit the data on consumption.  People still argue that rational intertemporal substitution with no liquidity constraint is consistent with the data (often even though the data analysis in the paper with that conclusion rejects that hypothesis) but only by arguing that there are extremely complex non separable utility functions which are not found in real or New Keynesian DSGE models.  So why is it a feature to make an assumption which is rejected by the data ?  Why is it a bug to make an assumption about consumption which is, at least, not demonstrably false ?</p>

<blockquote><p>The most ambitious effort to cut the bill is being led by  Sens. Ben Nelson (D-Neb.) and  Susan Collins (R-Maine), moderates in their parties who share a dislike of the current version. Collins is scheduled to visit Obama at the White House this afternoon. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to go to him with a list&#8221; of suggested deletions, she said.</p>
<p>Nelson said he and Collins have agreed to &#8220;tens of billions&#8221; in cuts, although he said he is skeptical that the effort will reach Collins&#8217;s target of $200 billion in reductions. The pair has counted up to 20 allies in their effort, with more Democrats than Republicans at this point. </p></blockquote>

<p>Bad Bank Bail-out and A Better Approach</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-banks4-2009feb04,0,5656617.story">E. Scott Reckard at the LA Times writes</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The federal government has invested $45 billion in Citigroup and guaranteed more than $300 billion of its troubled loans. Answering complaints that bailed-out banks aren&#8217;t lending, Citi said Tuesday that it had committed $36.5 billion &#8220;to support U.S. consumers, businesses and our communities during these challenging times.&#8221; The funds are mainly for home mortgages and purchases of mortgage-backed securities. </p>
<p>In normal times, $45 billion in bank capital might result in 10 times that amount in new loans. Citi described the $36.5 billion as the &#8220;first stage&#8221; of what it hoped to do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Put another way, that&#8217;s one awfully small money multiplier.  The reason its so small is that Citi is going to use the loot to support its past and present spending before it loans money out.</p>
<p>Back in September, I anticipated the problem and laid out what I thought was a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/cactus-offers-another-immodest-proposal.html">better approach</a>.  I still think its better.  Here it goes again:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Consider the role of banks. Banks essentially store money and act as payment agents for depositors, and they loan out money to borrowers. </p>
<p>Now, consider the role of the Fed. The Fed essentially stores money and acts as a payment agent for the banks, and it loans out money to the banks. Put another way &#8211; the banks are just an intermediary between the Fed and public. Put even more simply &#8211; the banks are a middle-man. Now, back in the day, it was necessary to have a middle-man, someone who knew the local market, who knew the depositors and knew the borrowers, and understood whether making a given load was a good idea. There&#8217;s no way the Fed, say, could do that from Washington.</p>
<p>But today, things are different. First, its clear that the banks have no idea who their depositors are, and much less whether the folks borrowing have any chance at all of paying back what they borrowed. That&#8217;s self-evident from the fact we&#8217;re even debating whether to bail out much of the industry. Second, in this day and age, what information they do have and use generally comes from third parties. They aren&#8217;t any better at buying FICO scores than anyone else would be. </p>
<p>So the question is &#8211; how exactly do we benefit from having the banks operating as a middle-man between the rest of us and the Fed? Why not let people deposit their money with the Fed, just like banks do, and let people borrow from the discount window, just like banks (and apparently some non-banks) do? I don&#8217;t see the benefits to giving banks rights that people don&#8217;t have, but I do see plenty of cost. I see a lot of duplication of services between various banks, and I see huge salaries going to the bank executives for that duplication and for acting as middle-men&#8230; and that doesn&#8217;t even count the cost of the current bail-out. Note also &#8211; salaries at the Fed are much lower. I believe Big Bad Ben Bernanke makes about $200K, a pittance compared to the salaries received by the CEOs of a number of banks recently driven into the ground. And there ain&#8217;t no stock options at the Fed either!</p>
<p>So I propose letting the public bank at the Fed, just the same way banks bank at the Fed. I&#8217;m not proposing banks be made illegal &#8211; if they can find a way to operate without having a getting privileged access to the Fed, wonderful. That&#8217;s free enterprise and it should be applauded. But the current system, where banks get privileged access to the Federal Reserve is rather unfair, and its been that way since long before this mess began.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann jumps into </p>
<p><a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2009/02/04/banker-pay-salmon-vs-barnett">a conversation between Felix Salmon and Megan Barnett on limiting banker compensation.</a></p>
<p>after the jump my comment which is addressed to Salmon.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that you&#8217;re surprised that I agree with you and disagree with Barnett.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say a strong argument for the cap is the good old moral hazard in bailouts argument.  If the bailout doesn&#8217;t inflict pain on bankers, they will rationally conclude that they are playing heads I win tails the US treasury loses and will rationally act to increase future expected payments from the treasury.</p>
<p>This argument was absolutely standard during previous bailouts (e.g. Alan Greenspan proposed bailing out NYC on terms such that no other city would ever become insolvent again).  Oddly the people who raised the moral hazard argument most loudly in all other bailouts are silent now (I&#8217;m not talking about Barnett).  It can&#8217;t be that they have more sympathy for rich bankers than for Democratic politicians and third world countries can it ? But is there any other way of reconciling what they said and what they are saying ?</p>
<p>Will banks refuse to participate, because it is not in managers interests to do so ?  Look it is not in managers interests to visibly place their own interests above those of shareholders and then go bankrupt.  If management refuses bailout money and the bank goes under they will have shareholder lawsuits to worry about and that means their current wealth will not be safe.  But I&#8217;m sure they can count on a fair hearing from a jury of their peers (th 7th amendment says that plaintiffs have the right to demand a trial by jury if more than $25 is at stake).  I&#8217;d guess that bankers who won&#8217;t work for $500,000 but whose banks might go under will quit, and good riddance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the argument that something must be done about Wall Street compensation is less compelling.  The cap is meant to be temporary.  Some sort of reform of compensation should be permanent.  Of course your argument that current incentives make crises more likely is, as yet, unrefuted, and you know lots of people would like to refute it.</p>
