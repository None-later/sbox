                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Matthew Yglesias doesn&#8217;t share the common view that gerrymandering has caused congress to be more partisan.  He <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/02/little_evidence_to_support_gerrymandering_polarization_link.php">notes</a> a recent paper (<a href="http://blogs.princeton.edu/mccarty/assets/gerrymander38.pdf">pdf here</a>) by Princeton’s Nolan McCarty, UCSD’s Keith Poole, and NYU’s Howard Rosenthal and quotes a bit and I quote a bit of that bit</p>
<blockquote><p>Both pundits and scholars have blamed increasing levels of partisan conflict and polarization in Congress on the effects of partisan gerrymandering. We assess whether there is a strong causal relationship between congressional districting and polarization. We find very little evidence for such a link. First, we show that congressional polarization is primarily a function of the differences in how Democrats and Republicans represent the same districts rather than a function of which districts each party represents or the distribution of constituency preferences.</p></blockquote>
<p>I comment on what I guess the paper says after the jump.  I don&#8217;t see how it can be convincing (now maybe I would if I read it).</p>
<p>I’d guess that you McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal are probably right, but I question your methodology. You and they seem to assume that representatives are free agents who decide based on their own policy preferences and those of their constituents. In fact, party leaders (in particular former majority leader DeLay) can impose party discipline. The leadership has actual power, and, in particular, has the power to decide who to appoint to the conference committees which actually write the final bills.</p>
<p>A possible explanation of polarization is that the Republican leadership used its great power to impose party discipline. Now how did that happen ? Part of it is that current and recent past leaders are hard line ideologues who are very sure that they are right and, especially, that Democrats are always wrong. Partly it is that they are partisan, eager to beat Democrats aside from the policy substance. Partly it is that they are unscrupulous.</p>
<p>So how did such extreme leaders (extreme especially in the means they are willing to use to impose discipline) get elected ? I’d say a likely explanation is that the median Republican representative moved right, became more ideological and partisan. That could be caused by gerrymandering.</p>
<p>I don’t see any way to test and reject the hypothesis that gerrymandering caused the median Republican to be further right which caused a hard line leadership to be elected which caused increased party discipline which appears as polarization. Of course the same thing could have happened to the Democrats. I happen not to have a sense of increased discipline based on the use of extreme means by the leadership, but I might be wrong.</p>
<p>Other representatives districts can affect Shays if they cause other representatives to vote for DeLay in the caucus.</p>
<p>The example of Cao seems to support this argument. He praised the stimulus and then voted against it. That sure looks like effective party discipline as opposed to ideological polarization with causes confined to New Orleans.<br />Or Connie Morella (R MD). Her votes are hard to reconcile not only with what she said as a representative from a bluish district but also with what she said before and anfter serving in congress. Looks like effective discipline not ideological polarization to me.</p>
<p>To try to sum up, I’d say that the causes of increased polarization prominently include the election of Gingrich, DeLay, Boehner and Cantor by the Republican caucus. That was caused by the orientation of the roughly median Republican representative and not on Chris Shays.</p>
<p>In the end I have no idea what role gerrymandering played. My argument is that you can’t determine the role by assuming that a congressman is affected only by his or her own district, and, I think, that assumption is necessary to your logic and the empirical analysis McCarty, Poole, and Rosenthal.</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>In comments there were requests for a clear unitary narrative summing up my view of Social Security. This is more difficult than it sounds because of the competing narrative is so simple and compelling: Boomer retirement hits Social Security, the latter itself goes &#8216;Boom&#8217;, lets do something now to mitigate the blow. Okay but how hard is the hit, what is the actual result, and can we clarify &#8216;something&#8217;? And what are the underlying assumptions? Suddenly the story gets not so simple.</p>
<p>And the same is true in reverse. If I set out to tell a simple story readers who have internalized those underlying assumptions in the course of perusing that competing narrative tend to stop you at every turn with questions starting out &#8220;Everyone knows &#8230;&#8221; In order to forestall this process your story-telling has to get more complicated. But I&#8217;m willing to give the no frills, no caveat version below the fold.</p>
<p>Social Security was set up in 1935 as two programs. One under Title 1 was a straight out government pension system paid out of the general fund. Title 1 was designed to phase out in favor of a Title 2 worker funded insurance plan. It is this Title 2 insurance plan that we know as Social Security today.</p>
<p>Like most insurance plans there is no direct connection between the dollar paid in and the benefit paid out, instead what you are buying is coverage, once your actual premium dollar is collected it belongs to the company, or in this case government, and you have to trust that the results of THEIR investment decisions and continued flow of premiums will be sufficient to pay out all claims. In Social Security lingo this is called Pay-Go with a group of active workers paying premiums and a group of retired workers collecting benefits.</p>
<p>Social Security is obviously non-profit so it can and does keep its premium as low as possible and still be able to pay out benefits. Those premiums are credited into two accounts at the Treasury Department: the Old Age/Survivors Trust Fund (OAS) and the Disability Insurance Trust Fund (DI). For reasons of convenience these are normally reported together as the OASDI Trust Fund, but legally they are quite separate and have different degrees of solvency. Currently OAS is more solvent than DI and overall is ten times larger, meaning that changes to it have a much greater effect on the health of the overall system.</p>
<p>Under the Act the Trustees are mandated to target Short Term and Long Term Actuarial Balance which is defined as having one year of reserves projected for the next 10 years or 75 years respectively. This is expressed in terms of a Trust Fund Ratio where 100=1 year. Currently DI is projected to drop below 100 sometime in 2017 en route to a total depletion date in 2025. Therefore it is in neither Short Term or Long Term Balance. OAS is projected to not drop below 100 until the late 2030s en route to depletion in 2042 meaning that it is in Short Term Balance but out of Long Term. The combined OASDI is, due to the larger size of OAS, roughly equivalent with Short Term Balance projected to fail in about 2029 when the 10th year (2038) projects to fall below 100 en route to a depletion in 2041. But for most purposes the Trustees deal with the combined OASDI numbers and talk about THE Social Security Trust Fund as do almost all commentators.</p>
<p>Social Security first had a TF ratio below 100 in 1971 and despite reform efforts in 1977 was on track for total depletion in 1983. We should note that Trust Fund Depletion does not equate to &#8216;No Check&#8217;, as long as FICA is collected there will be some payout. In fact there was no year before 1983 where interest on the Trust Fund accounted for more than 5% of total revenue. Still this was considered to be enough of a problem that the President and Congress appointed a 15 person commission known after its chairman as the Greenspan Commission. They studied the issue and set forth four different scenarios for the future. There was a more optimistic Low Cost model, a more pessimistic High Cost model and two Intermediate Cost ones. It was determined that a package of tax increases and changes in retirement age would under Intermediate Cost assumptions put the system back into Short Term Balance by the end of a ten year period and would ON AVERAGE do the same for the 75 year Long Term actuarial window.</p>
<p>The Greenspan Commission Plan worked, by 1993 the Trust Fund ratio was back above 100. This doesn&#8217;t mean everything was solved, the numbers still showed the TF going to depletion in around 2030 meaning that it would fall out of Short Term balance sometime late in the 2010s. Which left the people of 1993 the freedom to plan in leisure.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a></p>
<p>As it turns out they had more time than they thought. Actual economic performance after 1996 came in at or better than the more optimistic Low Cost model projected. And given that Low Cost projected no Trust Fund Depletion at all, that is it would have Social Security be fully funded with no change in benefits, taxation or retirement age, it seemed that a plan of &#8216;Nothing&#8217; was fully justified or at least the adoption of &#8216;Watch and wait&#8217; was perfectly defensible. By 2004 the projected date of Trust Fund depletion had advanced from the 2029 of the 1997 Report to 2042, an improvement of 14 years in outlook over an 8 year span. Given that the &#8216;There is no Crisis&#8217; movement of early 2005 had little trouble turning back the privatizers.</p>
<p>In the years since not much has happened to shake our faith in maintaining a &#8216;Watch and wait&#8217; approach to Social Security. Although Trust Fund depletion stopped moving out in time and is now set for 2041 the combined Trust Fund will still be in short term actuarial balance until 2029 and at that point leaving us with 12 years to plan and implement a fix. People who argue &#8216;We can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8217; have been proven wrong every year since 1997. We can and should stay alert and monitor the numbers but nothing currently justifies changes in taxation, retirement age, or the benefit formula. Until or unless privatizers can make the case for &#8216;crisis&#8217; using real numbers rather than talking points they should be pushed back.</p>
<p>Well that is the simple story, or as simple as I can make it. There is a competing narrative marked by what I conceive to be myths. I attempted some myth busting this morning on my site <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/02/social-security-2009-myth-busting.html">Social Security: 2009 Myth Busting edition</a>. No one has to read it but for those who are considering comments starting &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know&#8230;&#8221; well the odds are that I am familiar with your claim, have examined the evidence pro and con and have rightfully or wrongly dismissed it already. Though I will be happy to recapitulate my argument.</p>

<blockquote><p>Figure 1 also highlights a curious fact absent in popular discussions of the crisis. Unemployment in the US had already begun to ramp up in early 2007, long before the official recession start date in December 2007 and the vagaries of the financial crisis that came to a head in the latter half of 2008. Figure 1 suggests that the initial impulse to the current recession may not have been the credit crunch, but rather that the credit crunch aggravated already worsening economic conditions. &#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Occasionally, I have raised the issue of Participation Rate in decline since Oct/Nov 2001 or the official end of the 2001 recession. Participation Rate is the ratio between the Civilian Non Institution Population and Civilian Labor Force in the BLS Household Unemployment Report. From 1970 until 2001, the overall trend has been upwards as detailed here: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/web/cpseea1.pdf">A-1 Employment Status of the Civilian Non institutional Population</a> 16 years and over, 1970 to date. (pdf)</p>
<p>I have heard various explanations for this decline such as: baby boomers retiring, increases in disability, people seeking higher education while times are bad, etc. As a baby boomer who took a hit from W$ (rdan update here&#8230;W$ = Wall Sreet,com)in the late nineties and a second hit recently, I can assure you most of us will not be retiring soon. Baby boomers retiring would have the largest impact to deceasing Participation Rate and increasing the Not In Labor Force. Baby boomers as a group can not afford to retire. An increase in Disability from 1984 to 2002 as pointed out in <a target="_blank" href="http://guerby.org/blog/index.php/2009/01/24/193-l-inexorable-ascension-de-la-population-sans-emploi-aux-usa">Laurent Guerby’s blog</a> (comments section&#8230;translation <a href="http://fatknowledge.blogspot.com/2009/01/misleading-nature-of-unemployment.html?showComment=1233485880000#c6476664256538310252">here</a>) may be a factor; but, it is not likely Disability increased that dramatically between 2001- 2008. Laurent also looks at the people in prison and not counted which amounts to 1 in every 100 adults or 2.3 million adults. Violence and crime increases with increases in Unemployment. It is possible that Globalization and Productivity Increases have caused much of the decline also. “Der Spiegel” in its graph here: <a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/business/0,1518,grossbild-1062396-527289,00.html">Dwindling Power &#8211; Manufacturing</a>(US Labor) shows that between EOY 2001 and November 2007, ~1.75 jobs were lost in Manufacturing, which is largely male dominated. </p>
<p>It is pretty obvious the U3/U6 numbers do not account for the numbers of people now residing in Not In Labor Force and there was a time in the past when the BLS did account (to my knowledge) for that shift in the Civilian Labor Force. The usage of U3 numbers by financial experts and bankers to cite a tight labor force to justify interest rate increases in the past, in my opinion was patently ridiculous given the increased size of the Not In Labor Force. </p>
<p>It would seem to me that comparisons between 2001-2008 and other recessional periods (yes I am calling this a recessional period) such as the eighties is difficult to do without making adjustments for that percentage of the population no longer in the Civilian Labor Force and residing in Not In Labor Force today. In past recessional periods, Participation Rate either remained steady or increased as the job market improved. By making that adjustment, there would be an apples to apples comparison. <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/employment-report.html">Spencer’s post</a> addressed the comparison and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/5133349751593782839/">I left a comment</a> on it; but, the post does not address the difference in the portion of the Non Institutional population no longer counted in the Civilian Labor Force. </p>
<p>I am interested in opinions, thoughts, and facts as to my assumptions and whether there is a basis for what I see in Unemployment and the continuing decrease in Participation Rate. Thoughts?<br />____________________________________<br />guest post by run 75441</p>

<p>Arnold Kling <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/02/ross_douthat_on.html">states a widely held view succinctly</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I see elite Democrats as exploiting &#8220;the poor&#8221; in order to pursue their own drive for power. People who genuinely care about the poor work with the poor and give their own money to the poor. Liberals mostly just pose about caring for the poor and take money from others (including many who are not well off) to burnish that pose.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kling&#8217;s claim is a mathematical error as is shown  after the jump by formal analysis of a model in which no one wants power and no one cares about his or her pose but people support tax and transfer programs even though they don&#8217;t give to the poor. </p>
<p>Consider a world in which people are slightly altruistic.  So their happiness is not just the pleasure they get from consumption but the pleasure they get from consumption plus a tiny multiple of the pleasure everyone else gets from consumption.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say there is just one good.  The pleasure is an ordinary concave utility function of consumption u(c) with u&#8221;(c)<br />u(c_i) + (sum over j not equal to i of u(c_j))alpha </p>
<p>alpha must be tiny.  </p>
<p>Now assume that people have different endowments of this good and the world lasts one period.  For simplicity say 2/3 are rich with a high endowment Ch and 1/3 are poor with a low endowment Cl  Assume that u'(Ch) <br />update:  typo corrected above thanks to anonymous, Cstar and Arnold Kling in person.  Also on Kling&#8217;s suggestion I added a numerical example (watch out for typos)</p>
<p>People have 2 choices.  They can give to others and they can vote on the level tau of a flat tax the proceeds of which are shared equally.</p>
<p>There will be no giving if, for the richest person i and the poorest person j<br />u'(Ch) = (u'(Cl))alpha.  The rich person has lower marginal utility of consumption than the poor person, but alpha is much less than one so the optimal gift is zero</p>
<p>So what tax would there be ?  In this case, by assumption, people can&#8217;t gain or lose power.  They don&#8217;t have poses.  They don&#8217;t feel pride or shame. </p>
<p>The tax rate is decided by the rich majority.  It is not zero.  Raising the tax above zero has 2 effects on rich person i &#8212; she has to pay the tax which is like giving to the poor. By assumption at tau=0, the rich person is indifferent about giving a little.  The tax also transfers money from other rich people to the poor.  This pleases rich person i as it increases average pleasure from consumption since u is concave.  So all will support a tax and transfer program.</p>
<p>Kling&#8217;s claim that a person&#8217;s willingness to tax and transfer without a willingness to give shows that person doesn&#8217;t really care about the poor.  He is wrong.  In the model I have described people have no other motive to support a tax and transfer program and they do support it.</p>
<p>To be a bit more general, for any positive alpha, there can still be unanimous support for a positive tax even if rich people would like to take from the poor<br />u'(Ch) <br />Obviously the model is not realistic.  People do feel shame so they care about something other than their consumption and the consumption of others.  The point is that there is no need to introduce shame or pride or poses or the will to power to explain why some people who don&#8217;t give to charity support tax and transfer programs  (or why others who have given all they plan to give then go and vote for politicians who implement tax and transfer programs). </p>
<p>The common claim is based on carelessly assuming that people are either perfectly altruistic or completely indifferent to the interests of others.</p>
<p>update:  numerical example as requested by Arnold Kling himself in comments</p>
<p>A numerical example (likely more typos)</p>
<p>lets make Ch= 4 and Cl = 1 (before taxes and transfers).  u(c) is the square root of c so</p>
<p>u'(Ch)= 1/4 and u'(Cl) = 1/2.  there are 100 rich and 100 poor.  Alpha = 0.1</p>
<p>1/4 > 0.1/2 so the rich don&#8217;t give to the poor.</p>
<p>The tax is returned equally to all so the lump sum is 2.5tau</p>
<p>The income of the rich after taxes is 4-4tau+2.5 tau = 4-1.5tau</p>
<p>The income of the poor after taxes is 1-tau+2.5tau = 1+1.5tau.</p>
<p>The example is extreme as there is no dead weight loss due to the tax.  Income just happens there is no saving or labor supply or anything.</p>
<p>the utility of the rich is their own pleasure from consuming square root of (4-1.5tau) plus one tenth of the pleasure from consuming of the 99 other rich people or 9.9(4-1.5tau) plus one tenth of the pleasure from consuming of the poor or  10(1+1.5tau).</p>
<p>At tau equals zero the dereivative of the utility of the rich with respect to tau is &#8211; (10.9)(1.5)/4 + (10)(1.5)/2 = (9.1)(1.5)/4 >0.</p>
<p>Now alpha = 0.1 is really huge (on the other hand a population of 200 is really small)</p>

<p>People in comments on some of the previous threads have what are on the surface reasonable questions. These questions fall in part into two categories. Some long time followers of the Angry Bear Social Security series ask &#8216;Why are you still talking about this, we get it already&#8217;. While newcomers ask (and not always nicely) &#8216;Why are you making this so complicated, I don&#8217;t get it, it doesn&#8217;t match what I know, meaning I suspect you are just making it up.&#8217; Well it is hard to satisfy both at the same time. So lets back up.</p>
<p>This series started when Dan invited me in May 2008 to present a comprehensive outline of my thinking and research on Social Security since 1997. I put forth the basic outline in posts 1-12 as listed on this index page at my blog <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/05/social-security-posts-on-angry-bear.html">Social Security Posts on Angry Bear</a> About at this point I realized I was losing people so I put up a recap with <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/social-security-zero-basics-revisited.html">The Basics Revisited &#038; Three Myths</a>. The series continued in a more topical and less linear form alternating between discussion of then candidate Obama&#8217;s proposals to raise the cap and discussions about how and why the larger narrative on Social Security came to be. Was it really an economic argument about the best way to achieve retirement security? Or just a way of dismantling the centerpiece of the New Deal? Well I argued the latter, in my view all of this is driven by ideology.</p>
<p>In any event the series carried on (and further indexed on <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/06/more-social-security-posts-from-angry.html">More Social Security Posts from Angry Bear</a>) through 33 where I basically ran out of new topics. Which didn&#8217;t stop the series instead it continued in more reactive form with me responding to other blog posts and new documents until I kind of wrapped up after 44 on August 16 with this from a post on my site:<br />
<blockquote>In May I was invited to post on Social Security at Angry Bear. It was pretty rewarding and I have to thank rdan for the opportunity.</p>
<p>The series terminates with no. 44 not because I really have nothing left to say but instead that proceeding further kind of requires that people had been following along all the way, newcomers being kind of lost. So on the odd chance that anyone would like to read the whole series they are indexed in Social Security Posts on Angry Bear and More Social Security Posts from Angry Bear</p></blockquote>
<p> Well it didn&#8217;t really terminate, instead there were 11 more posts in fall including some renewed discussion of &#8216;backwards transfer&#8217; and &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; (which I argued were distortions meant to confuse the real issues) as seen indexed here <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/01/even-more-posts-from-angry-bear-late.html">Even More Posts from Angry Bear</a> until I terminated the series AGAIN with the election. At this point it was blindingly clear that we were in major, major economic trouble and with Democrats in firm control surely no one would waste an instant talking about a program whose problems if any could well be addressed starting around 2029 (date not chosen at random).</p>
<p>Well I couldn&#8217;t have been more wrong because in January it became clear that the Social Security haters hadn&#8217;t given up. Instead they set out to make a new run which led me to put up this post on Jan. 19th <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/social-security-reform-undead-return.html">Social Security &#8216;Reform&#8217;: the Undead Return</a><br />
<blockquote>What does it take? A stake through the heart? A bullet through the brain? Baker and Krugman do some push-back.</p></blockquote>
<p>And after letting the maestros have their say wrapped up the post as follows:<br />
<blockquote>In my view it is practically criminal for policy makers to be wasting a second talking about Social Security given the very real possibility we are headed for a new Great Depression. And so equally criminal for opinion makers to be twisting current events to pursue this old vendetta. It is a shame that people like Baker and Krugman still have to keep a vigilant eye out for the zombies intent on eating the flesh of Social Security. Maybe we can make a deal. If the Right will simply stop taking every possible opportunity to take a bite at Social Security then I promise to shut up. And then maybe we can let Krugman and Baker continue the really important discussion.</p>
<p>&#8220;Social Security &#8216;reformers&#8217;! Report back to your graves!&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> Well that deal stands, yet the undead still walk among us leading to this upcoming (Mar 2nd) article by Grieder in The Nation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090302/greider?rel=hp_currently">Looting Social Security</a> which I linked to and commented on with <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/looting-social-security-basics.html">Looting Social Security: (the Basics Revisited, Again)</a> on Friday Feb 13th. Posts since then have simply been commentary on issues raised in comments.</p>
<p>So the answer to the question &#8216;Why are you still talking about this?&#8217; The answer is that the Right didn&#8217;t take my offered deal, instead they are still gnawing away. And &#8216;Why are you making this so complicated?&#8217; Well it is a complicated subject and I can&#8217;t always slow down to give remedial lessons to latecomers. It bores the people who have been following along. We welcome people who want to join the conversation, but realize that like in any seminar if you haven&#8217;t done the reading you should set quietly or put it in the form of a question. Because assuming the teacher is a dimwit who doesn&#8217;t know the simplest thing may well end up with you getting your knuckles rapped plus a reading assignment.</p>
<p>Those who want to avoid the knuckle rapping would be well advised to read post 1 in the series and the two linked &#8216;Basics Revisited&#8217; ones. Because you may not in fact know what you think you know on Social Security.</p>

<p>Much is being made of the recent bottoming of the Dry Ships Index of bulk cargo rates.</p>
<p>Everyone assumes it is a signal of stronger demand.</p>
<p>But there are two reasons the index could be bottoming.</p>
<p>One is stronger demand.</p>
<p>But the other could be falling supply as the index represents the<br />loss minimization point where the ship owners lose less money<br />by docking the ships rather than by leasing them at this rate<br />because this leasing rate does not cover variable cost.</p>
<p>In other words the index could be bottoming because of<br />a contraction of supply rather than an increase in demand.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any information or data to support either thesis?</p>
