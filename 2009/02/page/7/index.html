<p>The bank bail-out that some of us <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/welfare-queen.html">said from the beginning would not succeed</a> hasn&#8217;t.  Now things have moved on, and we&#8217;re hearing about making it bigger or simply nationalizing one or more banks.</p>
<p>Now, I proposed a solution a while back, but before I mention it yet again, I&#8217;d like to wander off Abe Simpson-like, as meandering through one issue sometimes leads to clarity on another.  Long-time readers may recall that for a long time I was a consultant, and I did a lot of work for the military.  Now, for a lot of big companies, working for the military can be a sweet deal.  Just as a for instance, there&#8217;s an aerospace company that has a plant that takes up a few city blocks worth of land in the middle of Los Angeles.  Assuming they have the same arrangement now that they did just a few years ago, the land is owned by the US government and they pay rent of $1 a year to use that land.  And they don&#8217;t even do military work at that particular facility any more; the plant builds pieces for commercial airliners these days (though back in World War 2 it made a very fine fighter plane) but the $1 a year rent has been going on for a long time and the land would be worth a lot more for any other use.  (Where are the folks who always howl about rent control?)</p>
<p>Anyway, what I&#8217;m getting at is that a historical need (i.e., the need for fighter planes in World War 2) has led some companies getting privileges that continue on and on and on, long after the need for those privileges has disappeared.  That&#8217;s not to say that the beneficiaries of those privileges can&#8217;t find some way to justify them &#8211; the plant creates jobs, it ensures the capability is still there to quickly start building bombers should the need arise, yadda yadda, yadda yadda.  And of course, because things have always been done that way, well heck, the folks in the military and elsewhere in the government see no problem in continuing things that way.  Heck, they have built up a vested interested in continuing things the same way &#8211; relationships, future job prospects, etc.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean its the way it should be done.  And looking at disasters provides a helpful illustration.  Consider, for instance, a situation in which a number of the aerospace companies made a big and disastrous bet.  Perhaps they assumed they could build plane fuselages out of cow manure and kitty litter.  The advantages of such an approach, were it to work, are obvious &#8211; cow manure and kitty litter are much more inexpensive to obtain and work with than exotic materials and fancy composites.  The disadvantage of such an approach would be equally obvious: if by some miracle you manage to get a a plane with a fuselage made out of cow manure and kitty litter off the ground, it won&#8217;t simultaneously a) stay aloft under its own power or b) maintain structural integrity for very long.</p>
<p>Now, let&#8217;s say that for whatever reason, a bunch of aerospace companies decided to build planes out of cow manure and kitty litter.  A few years later, those companies would find themselves in trouble.   And its important to understand &#8211; these days, no single company builds a plane.  A piece of the fuselage is built here by company X, a piece is built there by company Y, the avionics are assembled by someone else, etc., etc.  In other words, there are what on Wall Street one would call &#8220;counter party risk.&#8221;  So not only would the companies that used cow manure and kitty litter be in trouble, other companies that dealt with them would be in trouble.  No matter how good your auto pilot software, its useless in a plane built out of bovine and feline waste.</p>
<p>So should these companies be bailed out?  Well, no.  The companies that chose to use kitty litter and cow manure made a stupid decision, and should be forced to live with it.  What about the counterparties?  Well, they shouldn&#8217;t be bailed out either &#8211; it should be part of their job to ensure they&#8217;re dealing with reasonable partners.  Hitch a ride to a winning partner and you make off like a bandit; hitch a ride to a losing partner and lose.  And if they have no way to verify whether that&#8217;s true, perhaps they&#8217;re in a business they shouldn&#8217;t be in in the first place.</p>
<p>And if these companies go bankrupt, its not the end of the aerospace industry.  The parts of these companies that are functional would be scooped up by other companies, provided they were deemed to serve some useful function going forward. </p>
<p>I think few people would disagree with me in this extreme example.  But the example also brings up one other thing &#8211; a disaster like this would provide an opportunity to revisit the subsidies the aerospace companies are receiving.  $1 a year for a few blocks of prime space in Los Angeles is simply welfare, and is the kind of detail that would probably come into the light uncomfortably if aerospace companies were in trouble for building planes out of cow manure and kitty litter.  Public outrage might have led to the death of these giveaways.</p>
<p>So back to the financial industry and the real world &#8211; its clearly a parallel to the aerospace industry in my little fable.  But what&#8217;s the counterpart in the story to the $1 a year in rent, the one part of my aerospace industry fable that is actually true?  Well, that&#8217;s easy &#8211; its the subsidy that comes from monopoly access to the Federal Reserve.  The banks can deal directly with the Fed &#8211; you can only deal with the Fed indirectly through the banks, which take a cut as middlemen. </p>
<p>And the solution to the whole financial mess is the same as the solution in my little fable: let the companies that made bad decisions fail, and end the subsidies the industry receives.  In other words, let the bad banks die, let their counterparties die as they made equally bad decisions (its not like companies in just about any industry aren&#8217;t able to figure out in many cases who their riskiest counterparties are, regardless of the industry they&#8217;re in, as per <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2009/02/companies-paring-exposures-to-risky.html">this piece by Yves Smith</a>), and end the banking industry&#8217;s monopoly access to the Fed.   A lot of banks will go bankrupt &#8211; after all, being a middleman is relatively easy work.  But a) its unfair and b) inefficient.</p>
<p>Following this approach would lead to some term pain &#8211; a lot of it in fact, but that pain is going to be there no matter what approach we take, and that goes doubly so for the silly and counterproductive plan pursued first by the Bush and now Obama administrations.   But in the long run, bringing the banking system into some semblance of capitalism will make everyone better off&#8230; except the grifters.<br />_______________________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>In a variety of comments posts I have argued that the 1983 Social Security compromise was not intended specifically to prefund Boomer retirement using several pieces of evidence including this interview with the Executive Director of the Commission <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/soc-sec-xxvii-robert-myers-and.html">Robert Myers and Prefunding Social Security</a>. Now as it turns out current projections indeed show that Boomer retirement has largely been financed; whether we use SSA&#8217;s date of 2041 or CBO&#8217;s date of 2049 the very youngest Boomers will be 77 or 85 while leading edge Boomers will be, er, dead. Given that in point of fact Boomers carried their own load and did pre-fund their own retirement, why not just say that this was part of the plan all along if that helps us win the argument? Well, a couple of reasons come to mind, but the biggest one is that by using this line of argument you risk falling into a Glibertarian trap by building their assumptions in. To see how this works we need to tell the same story from two perspectives.</p>
<p>Supporters of traditional Social Security tell the story this way:<br />1) The 1983 compromise raised payroll tax to pay for Boomer Retirement<br />2) But starting with Reagan the federal government just borrowed the money to spend on other things.<br />3) Meaning that any attempt to delay or avoid paying it back by cutting benefits is simple theft from workers.</p>
<p>While the conclusion is true and seems to flow naturally from the premises, the premises are themselves fatally flawed as we begin to see from the same story told from the anti-Social Security Glibertarian perspective. Note the changes along the way.</p>
<p>1) The 1983 compromise raised payroll tax with promises to save the extra for Boomer retirement.<br />2) This was a lie, instead the federal government just borrowed the money to spend on other things.<br />3) Tax and spend democrats also made no efforts to restrain other spending putting us in a position where we will never be able to pay Social Security back, overall debt being too high.<br />4) Meaning that younger workers will never see a penny from Social Security, it all going to the selfish  Boomers who ran up the debt.<br />5) And only chumps would have believed it would happen any other way. Because Big Government is never the Solution.<br />6) This wouldn&#8217;t have happened if the money had instead been put in private accounts safe from the government.<br />7) Though it is too late for Gen-X to recoup the losses why throw good money after bad, instead we should salvage what we can be going to private accounts today. After all something is better than nothing.<br />8) And if this means screwing over the Boomers? Too bad, they got us into this mess. And older generations? Well heck they got more out than they ever put in. (ed. the Backwards Transfer argument)</p>
<p>Now each and everyone of the steps in the Glibertarian argument are subject to challenge. But the door was open to it as soon as supporters in their own step 2 start out with &#8216;But&#8217; which puts in play the argument that you just can&#8217;t trust government to keep its promises. And this extends it self to both parties because the borrowing continued through Congresses and White Houses controlled alternately by both Democrats and Republicans.</p>
<p>Not every supporter of Social Security holds Social Democratic views. Indeed we have commenters who are convinced we should leave Social Security alone that lean in what I consider Reactionary directions (using &#8216;Reaction&#8217; in its European sense) and wouldn&#8217;t be caught dead identifying themselves as Democrats.</p>
<p>But I am both a partisan Democrat and someone pushing an overall Social Democratic agenda and won&#8217;t accept the starting point of &#8216;both parties are equally guilty&#8217;. Because they are not. In my view President Reagan did immense damage to this country. On the other hand he turned out to be an excellent steward for Social Security. Also in my view the first President Bush started out in some wrong directions only to realize that his original judgement back in 1980 was correct: Supply Side economics is in fact Voodoo Economics. (His late term tax increase may have doomed his re-election but helped prime the pump for the Clinton economy, and liberals give him too little credit for at least moving back in the right direction.) He too was an excellent steward for Social Security and in fact handed it over to Clinton with a Trust Fund right where it was supposed to be. On December 31st 2000 the TF ratio was 97, by Inaugeration day it would have been so close to the legal mandate of 100 as to not matter.</p>
<p>The real goal of the 1983 Commission had nothing to do with the specific timing of Boomer retirement. Per the interview linked above its first priority was to address the near term, which  Social Security  scores over a ten year window, with a secondary priority to be able to say that they had also addressed the long term, which Social Security scores over a seventy-five year window. They had neither the time or the intent to address specific intervals between the ten and seventy-five year window. So I intend to reject both the traditional supporter narrative of &#8216;theft&#8217; and the Glibertarian equivalent &#8216;government is always the problem&#8217; and tell the story my way. Below the fold.</p>
<p>1) By the late seventies it was clear that Social Security was headed to near term insolvency. The trend was undeniable, the TF ratio dipped below 100 in 1971 and simply continued to shrink through the next decade.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#159726">Table VI.A4.—Historical Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 1957-2007 [Amounts in billions]</a><br />2) When Reagan took the oath Social Security&#8217;s reserves were below three months (TF ratio of 25) and steadily bleeding. If nothing was done it would mean cutting benefit checks sometime in 1983.<br />3) Something was done. Reagan who would have liked to transform Social Security into something else concluded he had no real hope of doing so near term and so cut a deal with Tip O&#8217;Neill to create a Bi-Partisan Commission.<br />4) The Commission with the help of the technical staff at SSA developed four economic models a High Cost, a Low Cost, and two Intermediate Cost. Under Low Cost the whole problem would go away, under Intermediate Cost the problem would be solved for the first 10 years and ON AVERAGE for the next 75.<br />5) Because the immediate crisis was not Boomer&#8217;s starting retirement 25 years out, instead it was the looming shortfall in the very next year that would cause current checks to Greatest Generation retirees to get cut. It was not a matter of pre-funding but of funding period. (This part simply not being understood today).<br />6) The tax increases were phased in with the final piece not to be in place until 1990. This allowed benefits to be paid near term while slowly building the Trust Fund back to its mandated target of 100.<br />7) Since a TF ratio of 100 was simply considered the minimum buffer for operational safety against a temporary downturn, the excess of revenue over cost was kept in a safe and predictable instrument sheltered from market movements which is to say interest earning, non-marketable Special Treasuries. While diversification into other asset classes could be considered it wouldn&#8217;t be prudent to do that with the first year of reserves because a temporary drop in employment and hence current revenues was likely to coincide with a market downturn and so be exactly the wrong time to be selling equities.<br />8) (And this is important) Given that a TF ratio of 100 was considered to be a minimum to protect CURRENT benefits any year the TF ratio remained under 100 the overall system could hardly even be considered to be in surplus and so was not really pre-funding anything, and certainly not events 25 and more years out.<br />9) Between Reagan and Bush Social Security was returned to a TF ratio of 100 within a ten year period and Clinton inherited a clean short term slate.<br />10) Although the short term problem was solved, newer more detailed Reports showed that when you broke out the 75 year long term window that there remained some mid-term problems. In particular the retirement of Boomers starting in 2008 projected to take the TF to depletion sometime around 2030.<br />11) And even though the economy after the mid-nineties started sending the Unified Budget to surplus, much of that was due to rapidly growing TF surpluses after 1996, the challenge of funding Social Security in 2030 had not gone away.<br />12) Meaning that Republican demands for tax cuts were at best premature, and remained so even after it looked like the General Fund side would itself go to surplus. Instead the prudent thing would be to pay down debt held by the public in anticipation of new borrowing needs starting in the mid 2010&#8217;s.<br />13) Leading to the calls to &#8216;Save Social Security First&#8217;.<br />14) Meaning Reagan, Bush and Clinton all did the right thing when it came to Social Security, the first two restoring it to actuarial balance using Special Treasuries as the natural and safe instrument, and the latter preserving Social Security from being the cover for a short sighted set of tax cuts that would simply make things more difficult down the road.<br />15) Something that Bush II simply ignored in his desire to reward his base, as he so charmingly explained at the Oct 2000 Al Smith dinner. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/10/18/politics/main242210.shtml">Dueling Jokes At Dinner Of NY Political Elite</a><br />
<blockquote>Bush gazed around the diamond-studded $800-a-plate crowd and commented on the wealth on display.<br />&#8220;This is an impressive crowd &#8211; the haves and the have-mores,&#8221; quipped the GOP standard-bearer. &#8220;Some people call you the elites; I call you my base.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p> Insert hollow laugh here. Because he meant it.</p>
<p>Okay my story is a little longer than the supporters nice little three step one. And has the virtue of being actually true. But its real virtue is that it wholy undercuts the Glibertarian narrative. Taking it point by point:<br />1. The tax increase was not designed to pay for Boomer retirement. Indeed that specific question didn&#8217;t come up.<br />2. Nobody lied about anything. Instead they set in place a ten-year plan to restore Short Term Actuarial Balance using the same instrument the Trust Fund had pretty much always used: interest earning Special Treasuries<br />3. The General Fund deficits of the eighties were not the sole responsibility of the Democrats. Indeed they generally passed spending bills calling for less spending than Reagan asked for, just differently allocated. Those deficits were caused by Reagan&#8217;s insistence on buying guns and giving the wealthy tax cuts at the same time.<br />4. Starting in 2041 Gen-Xers MAY start receiving benefits only 25% better than current retirees do, down from a 60% benefit under the schedule. The idea that Social Security &#8216;will not be there for me&#8217; and that this is the fault of Boomers being a combination of ignorance of the numbers and inability to read a calender. The Boomers not only covered the mid-eighties shortages looming over the Greatest Generations benefit checks, we also ended up (more or less by happy accident) covering the projected gaps in our own. Mainly because we grew the economy more than lazy ass Gen-X slackers are projected to do.<br />5. Sorry pal, when it comes to securing retirement security for workers and particularly workers earning below the median Social Security instead shows that Government often can be a huge part of the solution.<br />6. Sorry again, there is no realistic scenario under which government operated PRAs would be legally more protected than the current system of Pay-Go. Only people who have beliefs that labels like &#8216;private&#8217; have magical powers would think so. Even if the accounts were in total control of the individual (something that is in no actual privatization plan out there), government can always operate in a way that destroys wealth. Take a look at your 401k.<br />7. Dude you haven&#8217;t lost anything. And nobody has devised a PRA plan does not simply screw over earlier generations.<br />8. Though apparently you don&#8217;t care that come what may you will make out better than the Greatest Generation did. Instead you would rather whine that Ida Mae Fuller lived to be a hundred. Well I suggest the selfish one is the guy staring back at you out of the mirror.</p>
<p>So once you abandon the ideas that in 1983 the point was pre-funding Boomers and that Reagan, Bush I and Clinton did something wrong by putting excess revenues in Special Treasuries (and so spending the actual cash on other stuff)  the whole Glibertarian case falls apart. While leaving those ideas to stay allows them to <br />validate their &#8216;all governments are inherently made up of thieves and liars&#8217; narrative.</p>
<p>That is why the Pre-funding myth is dangerous. At least to those of us with a Social Democratic agenda. It tends to block any idea of funding specific public goods (like universal single coverage) with any dedicated tax stream and promotes the idea that all taxation is fungible.</p>

<p>Why Save?</p>
<p>We keep hearing about the responsible Americans of bygone days who<br />saved their money and bought things when they could afford them.<br />These are distinguished from the careless present-day Americans who<br />buy things first and then scramble to find the money afterwards.</p>
<p>At this point, we might ask ourselves &#8212; why save?  After all, if you<br />can buy now and pay later, why save now and buy later?  Another<br />interesting point would be to ask why business would rather have us<br />buy now and pay later, rather than avoid risk by getting their cash on<br />the barrel head?</p>
<p>What nobody has dragged out into the open, at least that I&#8217;ve seen on<br />this blog, is that buying now and paying later is more expensive, in<br />some cases far more expensive, then saving and buying when you can<br />afford the item.</p>
<p>As senior tempter Screwtape used to say, &#8220;This is so obvious I&#8217;m<br />ashamed to have to say it.&#8221;  When you save now and buy later, you get<br />the item without having to pay interest &#8212; in fact, while the money is<br />in the bank you might even earn a little interest.</p>
<p>Secondly, once the consumer has a good cushion of savings in the bank,<br />he can be choosy about his purchases, and will have a keen awareness<br />of how long it took to accumulate those hundreds or thousands.  He<br />will think, rather than striking like a hungry trout.  He has acquired<br />the habit of waiting.</p>
<p>He can take advantage of very good bargains when they arise.  He can<br />smooth over rough times in his life, pay bills promptly, and even to<br />hold a certain amount of leverage with the financial institution to<br />get better terms in their dealings.</p>
<p>In short, people with ample savings can engage the marketplace on<br />their own terms.</p>
<p>Shifting from a savings-based society to a credit-based society has<br />the cumulative effect of maintaining the amount of stuff you can buy,<br />while increasing the amount of money you pay for money.  In some<br />situations, of course, this bargain is worthwhile.  The largest of<br />these is housing.  Only in the case of a generational money pool can<br />people pay cash for a house.  Yet, everyone needs a house to live in,<br />or a dwelling of some sort.</p>
<p>However, if such a generational pool is available, it cuts the cost of<br />housing about in half.  A $40,000 house, if there is still such a<br />thing around, would not cause the cumulative $80,000 that you might<br />pay over the course of a full mortgage.  A young Jewish friend of mine<br />and his new bride received a modest but well located home when they<br />married, as a gift from both their parents.  They began their married<br />life with a cut to their cost of living of several thousand dollars a<br />year.  This is a huge advantage.</p>
<p>In the absence of widespread savings, more of people&#8217;s incomes are<br />diverted to financial costs like service charges, interest charges,<br />carrying charges etc.  From their point of view this money is wasted.</p>
<p>Another, more subtle effect of widespread non-saving is the loss of<br />the ability to see the disparity between income and expenditure, in<br />ones own budget and that of those around you.  At the lower end of the<br />earning slope, people don&#8217;t save because they can&#8217;t.  Imagine them<br />standing knee-deep in a lake.   As one moves up toward the high-tide<br />mark of solvency, there comes a time when a better-paid person can<br />stand dry-shod no matter where the tide is – he can become a saver.<br />But if no one is a saver – if everyone&#8217;s shoes might be wet &#8212; then<br />detecting the danger of a rising tide becomes much more difficult.</p>
<p>What are savings?  Let&#8217;s think of them as the &#8220;profit&#8221; of the private<br />citizen.  In this case, the lack of savings indicates loss of profit<br />leverage in American households, and the rising tide of indebtedness a<br />further encroachment on their profits, for which they receive nothing<br />but avoidance of financial straits which their loss of private profit<br />forced upon them.</p>
<p>In an electrical system, this waste would be called line losses, in a<br />car engine, loss of compression.  In a society we call it injustice.<br />___________________________________<br />by Noni Mausa</p>

<p>My effort immediately below to explain some general equilibrium theory in English didn&#8217;t work out so well.  Here I will attempt to give simple examples which show how rational individual choice and/or trade between rational consenting adults can make everyone worse off.</p>
<p>Models will all involve strange fruit trees, that is assets which generate goods without labor.  There will be only 2 periods.  In the first period (period 0) agents plant trees and maybe buy and sell them.  It is allowed to short an apple tree (that is to promise to deliver the apples even if you don&#8217;t own the tree).  </p>
<p>Then in period 1 the trees produce fruit.  The amount depends on the state of the world (that is say the weather).  People fulfill the terms of their financial agreements.  Then people trade fruit on the spot market.  Then people eat the fruit giving them their only pleasure in the whole model. Then they die.</p>
<p>If there are so many different kinds of trees that, for each state of the world, one can construct a portfolio which pays a positive amount in that state and only in that state, then markets are complete and the free market outcome is Pareto efficient.  Otherwise it is easy to come up with examples in which rational behavior in period 0 makes everyone worse off in expected value.</p>
<p>One Example after the jump (I will add more when my fingers stop aching).</p>
<p>drought resistent apple trees.  Here there are only 2 states : in state 1 it rains a lot on the apple orchards, in state 2 it rains little.  The only choice in period zero is that people with apple suitable land have to decide wether to grow drought resistant apple trees which get mold if it is wet or drought sensitive apple trees which do great if it is wet.  People who grow apples get sick of them and don&#8217;t want to eat them.  They just eat the other good (oranges).  There are always the same number of oranges.  Orange growers have utility which is cobb douglas in apples and oranges.</p>
<p>Now if all apple growers plant drought resistent apples they all face no risk.  If there are half as many apples, the relative price of apples doubles.  They always eat the same number of oranges (and no apples they don&#8217;t like apples).  If one apple grower plants any drought sensitive apples and their is a drought, he will suffer.  If apple growers are risk averse enough, all drought resistant apples will be an equilibrium.</p>
<p>The orange growers face risk.  They always eat the same number of oranges but eat different numbers of apples depending on whether there is a drought.</p>
<p>A Pareto improvement is possible.  If all the apple growers plant half and half drought resistent and drought sensitive apples, then they are still safe and so are the orange growers.  This is a Pareto improvement.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not kidding.  Someone in some thread said that he or she thought it would be great if I could give a simple intuitive explanation of <a target="_blank" href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;q=geanakoplos+polemarchakis&#038;btnG=Search">Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis (1985)</a>.  Also I would get an interesting perspective on the crisis if I could fly to the moon.</p>
<p>I will try after the jump.  The G&#038;P result is that, if markets are incomplete, unless there is an amazing coincidence, there exists a regulation of financial markets which makes everyone better off than laissez faire.  </p>
<p>This does not mean we should decide to regulate.  The fact that such a regulation exists, doesn&#8217;t mean that it will be implemented if we just convince people that laissez faire is not optimal. It doesn&#8217;t even mean that economists can figure out a Pareto improving regulation and the problem is that those rotten politicians won&#8217;t implement it.  Thus the result has only one practical application.  If someone says that econmic theory or common sense tell us that free interactions of rational people must be in the interests of those rational people &#8212; that person has just said that he doesn&#8217;t know what he is talking about.  This is not a judgment call. There is a mathematical proof.</p>
<p>Before the jump, I will just notice that there are many reasons why free market outcomes are presumably not Pareto efficient.  The list of sufficient conditions in the most general description of economies with Pareto efficient market outcomes is very long, and for each sufficient condition for optimality it is easy to construct examples where, if the condition doesn&#8217;t hold, regulation can be good for everyone.</p>
<p>The requirements are rational expectations, well defined property rights, price taking behavior (which is really stronger than saying no agent has market power), no nonpecuniary externalities which implies, among other things, that people have no sense of pity and don&#8217;t mind knowing that others are starving, symmetric information and, finally, complete markets.</p>
<p>After the jump I will consider only the implications of incomplete markets as the assumption of complete markets &#8212; that for every distinguishable state of the world there is an asset which pays a positive return in that state and only in that state &#8212; is so absurdly false that no one claims it is a good approximation.</p>
<p>OK so the problem is to explain how rational choice by price taking agents with well defined property rights and symmetric information whose happiness depends only on their consumption leisure and whose actions don&#8217;t cause externalities except via prices (from now on RCBPTETC)can make all these agents worse off than they would be if the rational choices were constrained by a regulator who knows know more than they do and who can&#8217;t introduce new assets (like social insurance) which weren&#8217;t available to the private agents (from now on a RWKNETC).</p>
<p>The problem is that the proof really is based on an argument like &#8220;we have N inequalities and more than N variables so, generically, we can find variables such that all N inequalities are satisfied.&#8221; This is not intuitive.  I was asked for examples, but I won&#8217;t get to them in this post.  I will try to give examples in the next post.</p>
<p>I will define my terms (search for EOD to skip this part)</p>
<p>1. Price Taking:  Agents decide what to do given prices, including prices of financial assets and their exactly accurate forecasts of future prices as a function of the state of nature.  They assume that they can buy or sell any amount at current prices and ignore any effect that their buying and selling might have on prices.  The bolded passage is necessary for Pareto efficiency in a one period model without uncertainty (a model without financial markets).  It is also key to proving that equilibrium with financial markets is almost certainly inefficient.  Oh note this is describing free markets.  If goods are rationed by the regulator, agents know that they are.</p>
<p>2. Symmetric information: agents may not know much but they have the same information.  This, along with rationality means that they have the same accurate belief about the probability that something will happen.  With asymmetric information, insurance markets which are good for everyone can fail to exist due to the adverse selection death spiral.  Forcing all people to participate in such markets can be good for everyone.</p>
<p>3. Well defined property rights:  IIRC An assumption in all proofs that the market outcome is inefficient is that agents have an endowment and can choose to consume exactly that endowment neither buying nor selling.  This is related to externalities.  If anyone is free to pollute the air, then the good &#8220;clean air&#8221; doesn&#8217;t belong to anyone in particular.  If fish in the sea belong to no one in particular, there will be overfishing &#8212; that is all people including fisherman might be helped by restrictions on catches.</p>
<p>4. Externalities include envy, shame at one&#8217;s unearned good fortune and pity.  If people mind knowing that other people are starving, a world without starvation is a public good.  I help you if I give food to the starving.  Even if I care as much about you as I do about the starving person, if I care more about myself, then we can all be made happier by taxing each other to end starvation (and the formerly starving would be much happier).  The sort of externality that is assumed not to exist in proofs of the Pareto efficiency of the market outcome is any interest in anything except my own consumption and leisure.  Note not that people aren&#8217;t selfless but that we are completely totally absolutely selfish.  </p>
<p>Becker showed that the results can be generalized if people are divided into non overlapping sets (called &#8220;families&#8221;) where people only care about other people in their own set and someone in each set cares enough that if you take from someone else in the set and give to them, they will choose to give it back.  This is still very strong. He assumed that families don&#8217;t overlap (wonder if Becker explained that to his in-laws).</p>
<p>5. The regulator doesn&#8217;t know anything that the private agents don&#8217;t know.  This seems clear.  If the regulator knows better, then she can force people to do things which are in their interests but they don&#8217;t know it.  This result will interest no one who observes the actual senate actually legislating.</p>
<p>6. This corresponds to the &#8220;constrained&#8221; in Geanokoplos and Polemarchakis title.  The point is that, if there are incomplete markets, except for an amazing coincidence, making the markets complete *and* lump sum taxes and transfers can make everyone better off.  It makes the challenge of finding a Pareto improvement harder in an important way as one way in which public intervention is widely believed to have made us better off is by introducing new kinds of insurance such as unemployment insurance.  That&#8217;s too easy for G and P.</p>
<p>7. Pareto efficient:  Look this is a very weak claim.  It doesn&#8217;t mean efficient in any normal sense of the word.  A Pareto improvement (making everyone better off) is interesting.  The result that no Pareto improvement is possible (Pareto efficiency) isn&#8217;t interesting at all.</p>
<p>8: except for amazing coincidences.  This is an effort at an Egnlish translation for &#8220;generically&#8221; which means &#8220;for an open and dense set of economies.&#8221;  The claim is be &#8221; if for some set of tastes technology and endowments the market outcome(s) isn&#8217;t (aren&#8217;t) constrained Pareto efficient, then there is a change in endowments so tiny that, after the change in endowments, the new economy has a market outcome which isn&#8217;t constrained Pareto efficient (or many outcomes which aren&#8217;t).&#8221;  That means the set of economies with constrained Pareto inefficient outcomes is open.  Also if there is an economy with a constrained Pareto efficient outcome, there is a tiny change (as tiny as you want) in endowments so that with the new endowments the outcome of the new economy is constrained Pareto inefficient (that&#8217;s the dense part).</p>
<p>EOD</p>
<p>OK the idea of the G&#038;P result.  First the model is a general equilibrium market with financial assets.  The idea is that there are 2 periods, period 0 and period 1.  IN period 0 agents trade financial assets which are all in zero net supply.  The state the world will be in in period 1 is not known but everyone knows the probability of any possible state.  Assets have payouts which depend on the state of the world.  After the uncertainty is resolved (that is in period 1) agents buy and sell goods on ordinary spot markets, then they consume, then the universe ends.  General equilibrium theorists claim that theis simple structure isn&#8217;t really as restrictive as it seems.</p>
<p>The point is that trades in the financial assets in period 0 will generally affect the prices in period 1 except in the case of amazing coincidences.  One such amazing coincidence if if everyone has identical homothetic preferences so aggregate excess demand is a function of the aggregate endowment and relative prices (so demand can be represented as demand by a representative consumer).  In this case only transfering wealth from one person to another (what financial assets do) can have no effect on spot prices in period 1.</p>
<p>So generically decisions made in period 0 will affect spot market prices in period 1.  This is a pecuniary externality.</p>
<p>Now if we just look at one state of the world in period 1, there will be no way to make everyone better off by messing around with trade on the spot market in period 1.  By then the economy has become a one period Walrasian economy with a Pareto efficient market outcome.  </p>
<p>If the regulator messes with trade in financial assets in period 0 then some people iwll be richer and some poorer in some realizations (say one called s) of the state of the world in period 1.  If these people have different tastes or if the distribution of wealth affects demand (as in some goods are luxuries) then this will affect spot prices in those states.  The change in spot prices will help people who are selling goods whose relative price goes up and hurt people whose are buying those goods.  That effect, the change in spot prices due to changes in trade in financial assets in period 1, will move the state s outcome from one Pareto efficient outcome to another.  It will help some people and hurt others.  </p>
<p>As always, it might increase the happiness of the people it helps by a tiny number of utils and hurt the people it hurts by a huge number of utils.  That is Pareto efficient is a very weak result.  To be more exact, choose one good and call it the numeraire.  the market outcome in state s will maximize the weighted sum of utility of all the agents with weights equal to the inverse of that agents marginal utility of consumption of the numeraire good in state s. </p>
<p>This means in each state a weighted sum of utility will be maximized but the weights will, in general, be different for different states (with low weight in state s on the utility of an agent who is poor in state s)</p>
<p>The key point is that we know that the indirect effects on utility of messing with financial markets through spot prices will be of different signs for different agents in each state, but we don&#8217;t know anything about the effect on expected utility. Each agent knows that she will be helped some times and hurt some times, but knows nothing about the probability weighted average effect on utility.</p>
<p>OK so to get to the result that messing with what people buy and sell on the financial market (making them hold different amounts of financial assets than they want to) can make them all better off it is necessary to have 2 things.</p>
<p>1. The relative weights on different agents are different in different states.  If there are complete markets, then the relative weights will always be the same (the weights are constants all multiplied by the same state specific factor for each agent).  So the market outcome is Pareto efficient.</p>
<p>2. There have to be enough assets that the arbitrary vectors of changes in welfare do to messing around with portfolios are numerous enough that a linear combination of such changes adds up to a vector with all positive elements &#8212; that is a Pareto improvement.</p>
<p>The theorem requires an assumption about the number of assets compared to the number of different types of agents.  Dimensions of messing with portfolios will be something like number of assets times number of agents minus 1 (because the assets are in zero net supply).  There are as many inequalities to satisfy to get a Pareto improvement as there are agents.  </p>
<p>Except for amazing coincidences, you can satisfy N inequalities if you have N unknowns so basically it is needed that the numbers of dimensions of meddling with portfolios is greater than the number of different types of agents.</p>

<blockquote><p>5. Most comments have been yankee-centric &#8211; perhaps mirroring readers interests and geography. I can warm to risk appetites returning when Global ZIRP arrives and begins to push the mountains of cash investors hold, further out on the risk curve. And global fiscal packages diminish the nominal falls and begin &#8211; not necessarily to get traction &#8211; but just stabilize things. NOT intermediaries, or leveraged punters, but owners of capital whose initial forays will resemble a tug-o-war with the ongoing deleveragistas, happy to finally catch a bid in something. Don&#8217;s comment was a good one. It highlights the historical assumption that the developed world would eventually close in on us, by rising to our level &#8211; not by dragging us down. But globalization is at least partially about convergence, and the leverage in the west papered over fundamental unsustainabilities about such rosy western convergence notions that must be confronted in the absence of cold-nuclear fusion, flux capacitors and unlimited resources.</p></blockquote>

<p>Global rules make for greater concern.   If trade does not pick up in 2009, how does Japan deal with the trade imbalances occurring now?  What will be the engine for them?</p>

<p>We will be trying the wikinvest related post widget shortly.</p>
<p>Update:  I have several concerns.  I have noticed it being used on many sites.</p>
<p>1.  Inadvertent mislabeling, as in Robert&#8217;s apples and oranges description, mixed up commodities, computers and stocks, and  other.  This can be dealt with immediately via e-mail to wikinvest (thanks to the quickness of Vikram, who is excellent as modifications are made).</p>
<p>2.  Wikinvest also links to their wiki like posts on topics of interest. The same format is used in that changes can be made to postings by anyone.  The post on Social Security was appalling, not getting even basics correct (12.4% SS and the rest medicare).  I would hesitate to link to information over which I have no control.  Maybe this aspect can be modified.</p>
<p>3.  The idea for links for related posts on other blogs sounded great, but I am not sure the randomness serves a purpose.  While we have overlap with Naked Capitalism, there was also a lot of Financial Armageddon, and no Baker.  Our own posts would get a boost, but I am not sure in what way.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>Update 2:  I like the <a target="_blank" href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/obey/2009/02/bailout-link-fest-16-02-09.php">Bailout linkfest at TPM</a></p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I am still trying to understand why smart economists have made extremely silly arguments against the stimulus.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/02/on-the-treasury-view.html#comments">I am thinking of the dark ages of macroeconomics and the Treasury View.</a></p>
<p>I think an analogy is useful.  It is related to the original dark ages and modern medical practice.  The analogy is not for the faint of stomach and is after the jump.</p>
<p>My sense is that Fama and Cochrane et al responded to the suggestion of a fiscal stimulus with excessive haste and confidence, because they thought it was proven decades ago that Keynes was wrong about everything.  So they assumed that an obvious simple argument was probably valid and had to work their way from making predictions based on an identity to arguing that the velocity of money is constant and the data on money and GNP are all irrelevant.</p>
<p>My analogy follows:  How would you expect a physician to react if a colleague suggested the use of leeches ?  My guess is that many physicians would call security and consider whether it would be enough to deprive that colleague of his license of if a, strictly temporary, this is the 21st century, bit of physical restraint for his own good was needed.  I might be wrong.</p>
<p>Notice, I said many physicians.  I didn&#8217;t say many ER physicians or many trauma surgeons.  The reason is that the medicinal leech is currently used in modern medical care.  Leeches somehow manage to get anti-coagulants into tissue where blood isn&#8217;t circulating.  <a href="http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/1999/jan/08/leeches-help-blood-flow-in-womans-reattached-thumb/">They are attached to severed limbs to prevent the blood from coagulating.</a>  (look I warned you it wasn&#8217;t for the faint of stomach).  I know the link isn&#8217;t super convincing, but I know this from many sources and my stomach isn&#8217;t up to more googling.</p>
<p>So think of Fama as, say a psychaitrist or dermatologist nearing retirement.  He hears that people are talking about sticking a leech on a patient.  His reaction is to assume they are quacks and argue that leeches never did anyone any good and transmit diseases.</p>
<p>Why I know people who have practiced medicine for over 50 years and never dealth with a patient with a severed limb.  It&#8217;s perfectly reasonable for a physician in some other field to have no idea what to do if a patient and a limb arrive separated at the ER.</p>
<p>Similarly, it is perfectly reasonable for an economist, even a macro-economist, to have no idea what to do when faced with a recession and a liquidity trap.  Liquidity traps are really rare.  One can be a perfectly competent practicing macro-economists without ever having thought of the concept of a liquidity trap.</p>
<p>In strange cases, the optimal treatment can be very strange.  </p>
