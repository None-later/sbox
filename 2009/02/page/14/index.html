                                <p>Robert Waldmann responds to Arnold Kling&#8217;s response</p>
<p>Arnold Kling was generous enough with his time to respond <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/01/reply_to_robert.html">here</a> to a post of mine</p>
<p>Sorry I was AWOL.  Thank you Arnold Kling for responding to me.  I&#8217;m flattered.</p>
<p>&#8220;Not quite. The more heterogeneous labor force does not necessarily raise the natural rate of unemployment. However, it makes it harder to recover from an adverse shock.&#8221;</p>
<p>On heterogeneity and the Beveridge curve, I don&#8217;t see how heterogeneity can make it harder to recover from a shock or reduce the beneficial impact of a stimulus and increase the costly impact without causing the Beveridge curve to shift out.  Shocks occur constantly, gross worker employer separations and hires occur at a huge rate compared to net changes in employment.   I can&#8217;t think of a model in which the task of matching workers with jobs has become much more difficult, yet the Beveridge curve is about where it was.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the explanation is that people differ in dimensions other than educational qualifications, so total heterogeneity hasn&#8217;t increased that much, and that matching technology has improved (you know the internet and all that).</p>
<p>more on his response after the jump.</p>
<p>
<blockquote> Now, in order to get them back to work you need to add demand that specifically uses their skills. This is a much harder trick to pull off. My Hayekian point is that this sounds like a task better suited to the market, not for Washington&#8211;hence my remark about &#8220;central planning.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think that a stimulus that allows the private sector to figure out resource allocation (my preferred approach being a cut in the employer contribution for Social security) is more likely to be effective than a stimulus where the government tries to figure out the resource allocation (health care IT, &#8220;green jobs,&#8221; etc.).</p></blockquote>
<p>You seem to be assuming that workers can&#8217;t shift from sector to sector if there is surplus demand for labor in one sector (do to the stimulus) and not in another.  This is a rather pessimistic view of the magic of the market.</p>
<p>You think that an increase in demand for labor should therefore match the education, geographic, occupation, education, age gender etc of the excess supply (unemployment).  So you conclude that the right policy is an equal across the board shift in demand.  </p>
<p>It is not enough to believe that the market is better than the government in every way to conclude this.  You have to assume that any effort at targeting will be worse than no targeting, so, for example, there is no hint as to relative sudden employment in construction and in agriculture.  </p>
<p>Whether there is an accross the board stimulus (cut in payroll taxes) or a sector specific one, the market will figure out how to get people into jobs in roughly the same way.  Each intervention implies miss match and need for the market to match people.  Which creates a bigger problem is one of &#8220;payroll tax cuts vs the current stimulus&#8221; not &#8220;the market vs the current stimulus.&#8221;   </p>
<p>I think I can reproduce the logic that leads to the payroll tax proposal</p>
<p>1. Things that happen in the market are optimal, therefore the government should not tilt the playing field.<br />2. Something very bad has happened in the market as is shown by aggregates cliff diving.<br />3. Therefore we should assume that that which has clearly gone terribly wrong in the market has gone equally wrong in every sector so the government shouldn&#8217;t tilt the playing field.</p>
<p>I see a coherent position that everything is for the best in the best of all possible market economies.  I can&#8217;t see the logic of a position that the economy is messed up but there is no way for policy makers to estimate which sectors are more messed up than others.   </p>

                                <p>Well not really, they just repeat some talking points without giving numbers. (via Dean Baker) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/editorials/stories/2009/02/03/badstim.ART_ART_02-03-09_A8_VPCP5R0.html?sid=101">Stimulus plan should focus on private-sector jobs, not increased social spending</a><br />
<blockquote>Also, the $300 billion targeted for social programs, many of them Democratic favorites, would not generate much immediate economic activity. Improving teacher quality, providing additional cash for Head Start and promoting wellness, for example, are standard government social-spending items that have little to do with stimulating instantaneous economic activity. Democrats are simply expanding spending on their traditional priorities under the cover of an economic emergency.</p>
<p>In fact, only about 5 percent of the plan&#8217;s spending is aimed at the immediate creation of jobs through infrastructure projects, such as repair and construction of roads and bridges. But if the goal is to blunt a wave of job losses as Obama has said, this is where the money should be spent. It also is the only kind of spending that represents a lasting investment, one that will benefit the future taxpayers who will be footing the bill for this borrowed spending.</p></blockquote>
<p> Well I got to call bullshit on this. Unless someone out there can actually present a list of spending that supports either number. 5% of the bill adds up to about $45 billion. Is that really all that is being spent on job creation? Maybe if you limit your definition to roads and bridges. But buildings have lasting utility and create jobs. And some services have lasting utilities and researchers and teachers fill jobs. But even absent that is there really $300 billion in social programs in this bill? Well lets see. Using real numbers.</p>
<p>Under the House Bill spending is divided into Division A which are basically contracts and Division B which is direct government spending. Looking from the top down how does that break out? In the following I will give the total for the category (plus obvious social spending).</p>
<p>Division A<br />Title 1 $248 million General Provisions <br />Title 2 $27 billion Agriculture, Nutrition, Rural Development ($20 billion Supplemental Nutrition Assistance)<br />Title 3 $14 billion Commerce, Science, Justice<br />Title 4 $4.8 billion Defense <br />Title 5 $49 billion Energy and Water<br />Title 6 $8.5 billion Financial Services and Federal Building<br />Title 7 $1.1 billion Homeland Security<br />Title 8 $14.5 billion Interior and Environment<br />Title 9 $91 billion Labor and Education ($71 billion excluding school construction)<br />Title 10 $7 billion Military Construction and Veterans Affairs<br />Title 11 $500 million State Department<br />Title 12 $59 billion Transportation and HUD ($11 billion Housing Assistance, $5 billion  Community Development)<br />Title 13 $39 billion State Fiscal Stabilization (???)<br />Total $358 billion.</p>
<p>First we are not really getting very far towards that $300 billion in social spending. And that figure of $45 billion for infrastructure is clearly bogus unless you simply limit your focus to Title 12 and ignore all spending on government buildings, schools, energy (including the smart grid), water projects (because levees and dams are infrastructure) and broadband build out.</p>
<p>Division B<br />Title 1 $79 billion Tax Provisions<br />Title 2 $45.6 billion Unemployment and Struggling families ($45.6 billion)<br />Title 3 $13 billion Health Insurance for the Unemployed ($13 billion)<br />Title 4 $20 billion Health Information Technology (???)<br />Title 5 $89 billion Medicaid ($89 billion)<br />Total $248 billion</p>
<p>So we can see at least $218 billion in what could immediately be labeled Social Programs. But that includes $20 billion in food stamps, $58 billion in spending on the unemployed, and $89 billion on medicare. Now maybe some of that can be pared back but I don&#8217;t know of anyone who seriously says we should let the jobless and working poor just starve or go without access to medical care. Plus a lot of the Title 12 spending on Housing Assistance and Community Development ends up funding infrastructure. Making the following kind of heartless &#8220;$300 billion targeted for social programs, many of them Democratic favorites, would not generate much immediate economic activity&#8221; as well as being economic nonsense. Huge percentages of that total (however derived) are directly injected into the economy in purchases of food, household essentials, utility payments and rent. The only pool of money that remotely meets the description of Democratic favored social programs (as opposed to not letting people starve, which ideally is not a partisan issue) is the money in Title 9 Labor and Education. Which I will break out under the fold.</p>
<blockquote><p>Improving teacher quality, providing additional cash for Head Start and promoting wellness, for example, are standard government social-spending items that have little to do with stimulating instantaneous economic activity. Democrats are simply expanding spending on their traditional priorities under the cover of an economic emergency.</p></blockquote>
<p> Quite apart from the ridiculous implication that these items even remotely start adding up to $300 billion, the premise is not very sound to start with. I believe it was Ken who linked to a study showing the direct economic benefits from Head Start. But in any event what are the dollars involved.</p>
<p>Title 9 breaks down into the following categories:<br />$20 billion Health and Human Services<br />$4.6 billion Employment and Training Administration<br />$20 billion School Modernization and Repair <br />$17 billion Student Aid<br />$30 billion Other Education<br />$600 million Other Title 9</p>
<p>Given that no one seriously is proposing eliminating student loans and that School Modernization is both infrastructure and would stimulate economic activity (if not instantaneously, someone is smoking tax cut weed) we seem to be left with some $50 billion that potentially fits the Dispatches description. So lets take it down a level.</p>
<p>Subtitle A Labor<br />$500 million State grants for training and employment programs<br />$1.2 billion State grants for youth job programs and other activities (youth defined as 24 or younger)<br />$1 billion State Grants for training dislocated workers<br />$500 million national dislocated worker reserve fund<br />$50 million YouthBuild program<br />$750 million Training and placement in high tech and emerging industry sectors<br />$120 million Community Service Employment for Older Americans<br />$500 million State unemployment administration<br />$80 million Administration<br />$300 million Job Corps</p>
<p>Subtitle B Health and Human Services<br />$500 million Grants to Health Centers<br />$1 billion Renovation and Repair of Health Centers<br />$88 million Equipping new headquarters of the Public Health Service<br />$600 million Training nurses, doctors and dentists<br />$462 million Center for Disease Control for equipment, construction and renovation<br />$1.5 billion National Center for Research Resources for renovation and repair of non-Federal Research facilities<br />$1.5 billion Office of the Director for research grants<br />$600 million NIH buildings and facilities<br />$700 million Comparative effectiveness research<br />$1 billion Low Income Home Energy Assistance (1981 Act)<br />$2 billion Child Care block grants to States<br />$1 billion Head Start<br />$1.1 billion expansion of Early Head Start<br />$1 billion Community Services Block Grants<br />$100 million Faith Based and Community Groups<br />$200 million Aging Services (1965 Act)<br />$2 billion Information Technology<br />$900 million Public Health and Social Services Emergencies Fund<br />$3 billion Prevention and Wellness Fund<br />But lets see how this breaks down: $2.35 billion to the Center for Disease Control including $954 million for immunization and $554 million for chronic disease, health promotion and genomics programs</p>
<p>Subtitle C Education<br />$13 billion Education for the Disadvantaged (pursuant to the ESEA Act of 1965)<br />$100 million Impact Aid (offsets the impact of local military bases not paying property tax)<br />$1 billion School Improvement (this relates to a Homeless act, how exactly I don&#8217;t know)<br />$225 million Innovation and Improvement<br />$13.6 billion Special Education<br />$700 million Rehabilitation and Disability Research (getting the disabled into the work force)<br />$16 billion Student Aid for College Students (Pell grants)<br />$50 million Student Aid Administration<br />$100 million Higher Education<br />$250 million Education Technical Assistance Act (statewide data systems)</p>
<p>Where the hell is the wishlist here? This is overwhelmingly continuing funding for existing programs. I don&#8217;t even see an obvious place for the Dispatch&#8217;s &#8220;improving teacher quality&#8221;, maybe it is somewhere in that rather mysterious $1 bn for &#8216;school improvement&#8217;. As for Head Start we are talking $2.1 billion or about .25% of the bill. And &#8220;wellness&#8221; seems to be just tucked in with the wider program to tackle chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Once again we can see that these anti-stimulus people are not even cherry-picking, instead they are digging deep into the bill to pick nits. The categories of spending the Dispatch editorial writer is point out as support for his advice to &#8220;Start over&#8221; represent less than 1% of the total package. (And BTW the guy swallows the Fama argument whole). Each and everytime some one expresses outrage over some line item &#8220;tax breaks for Hollywood!&#8221; or &#8220;teacher quality&#8221; to try to make people think the whole bill is just payback to campaign supporters. Instead the argument is just bogosity, bluster and bullshit meant as a stalking horse for tax cuts (which is what he means when he says &#8220;private-sector jobs&#8221;).</p>
<p>This is just not an economic argument. And sorry I still can&#8217;t taste the liverwurst.</p>

<p>The Case for No Stimulus</p>
<blockquote><p>For the last three months, Americans have been treated to a debate over what the government can do to ease the effects of the current recession and bring about a speedy recovery. Lawmakers of both parties are now considering a very large stimulus package.</p>
<p>But there is a catch. Every penny of such a package must be borrowed, because the government is already running a $1.2 trillion deficit this year and faces a $703 billion deficit for next year, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. The question, then, is whether the government can help the economy by spending money if it can only do so by first sucking that money out of the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>An <a target="_blank" href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YWE0OGQyMzNiMjg4MGNkZDc1N2I1NzlkMzY2YTQ2NDE=">interview</a> with Heritage Foundation&#8217;s leading budget analyst Brian Riedl, can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>1)  &#8220;Every dollar Congress injects into the economy must first be taxed or borrowed out of the economy&#8230;.Therefore, again, there is no net increase in aggregate demand. It just means that one group of people has $800 billion less to spend, and the government has $800 billion more to spend.&#8221;</p>
<p>2)  &#8221; There is this notion that the redistribution of money from savers to spenders creates new spending&#8230;&#8230;.people use their savings to pay down20debts or invest. Or they put it into the bank, who in turn lends it to others to spend. Therefore, savings circulate through the investment side of the economy, which counts just as much in the GDP as the consumption side of the economy..&#8221;</p>
<p>3)  &#8220;The government is going to have to raise interest rates in order to convince people to lend them the full amount they need. We’re already facing a deficit of $1.2 trillion this year, and 700 billion next year. We borrowed $700 billion for TARP, and now we’re going to borrow $800 billion for this stimulus package. Compare those numbers to the entire public debt, which was 5.8 trillion up until a few months ago. It’s going to be very difficult for a global economy, which is already in a recession, to supply the U.S. government with [$3 trillion] in new borrowing&#8230;..The government may have to raise interest rates higher and higher and higher in order to persuade people to lend their diminishing savings to the government.</p>
<p>4)  &#8220;So we’re actually going to pay to induce people not to invest in the economy, to hide their money in government bonds instead.  There’s only so much savings to go around in the private economy. Every dollar of savings that government snatches up through borrowing is one dollar of savings less to be invested in businesses that create jobs. It’s one dollar less to expand new technologies. And so there’s a real danger that the economy is going to suffer long-term be cause it’s not going to have the investment capital to create productivity and jobs, because Washington is gobbling up all the savings for their own spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>5)  &#8220;Economic growth depends on productivity growth, and that on whether we’re using some of our money to create jobs, capital and technology that allows the economy to grow in the future. If you believe that the private sector is better at spending money to create investment and productivity than government, then letting individuals keep more of the money they earn, in the long run, will increase the economy’s capacity to produce wealth&#8230;. That’s why the government policy right now—borrowing money out of savings and investment and putting it into consumption—will not only be zero sum in the short run, but it will actually reduce our long-run capacity for growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>6) &#8220;There are some things the government can provide that would actually improve the economy—say, if they build new and badly needed roads, or a new electrical grid that allows us to deliver electricity better and more cheaply. But the benefit of such investments would be years away, would they not? (and) the immediate act of having the government borrow money and hire people—does not necessarily create any jobs&#8230;&#8230;.In the long run, the existence of a strong infrastructure with highways that allow the transport of goods and services, can help the economy grow . . . But in the short run, the act of spending $1 bi llion on highways does not stimulate the economy. The 34,000 highway workers that receive that billion dollars are receiving a billion dollars that had to be borrowed out of the private economy, which in turn lost the same amount of money and thus is able to support fewer jobs for now . . . So when you borrow and spend that money, you’ve just shifted jobs from one part of the economy to the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Both <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123317069332125243.html" target="_blank">Putin</a> and a Premier Wen&#8217;s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/WenJiabao02182009.pdf" target="_blank">Jaibao&#8217;s</a> (China) speeches at Davos deserve real attention, for they indicate how two major world players are approaching the global economic slowdown. Each has a slightly different take on its causes; each approaches the solution a bit differently.</p>
<p>In this post, I will look only at some of Putin&#8217;s remarks. They are far more even-handed than Wen&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Russia is clearly positioning itself between the U.S. and China.</p>
<p><strong>Putin on the financial causes</strong>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the last few months, virtually every speech on this subject started with criticism of the United States. But I will do nothing of the kind. </p>
<p>I just want to remind you that, just a year ago, American delegates speaking from this rostrum emphasised the US economy&#8217;s fundamental stability and its cloudless prospects. </p>
<p>Today, investment banks, the pride of Wall Street, have virtually ceased to exist. In just 12 months, they have posted losses exceeding the profits they made in the last 25 years. This example alone reflects the real situation better than any criticism.</p>
<p>The time for enlightenment has come. We must calmly, and without gloating, assess the root causes of this situation and try to peek into the future.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the crisis was brought about by a combination of several factors.<br />The existing financial system has failed. Substandard regulation has contributed to the crisis, failing to duly heed tremendous risks.</p>
<p>Add to this colossal disproportions that have accumulated over the last few years. This primarily concerns disproportions between the scale of financial operations and the fundamental value of assets, as well as those between the increased burden on international loans and the sources of their collateral.</p>

</blockquote>
<p><strong>Putin on the global causes</strong>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The entire economic growth system, where one regional centre prints money without respite and consumes material wealth, while another regional centre manufactures inexpensive goods and saves money printed by other governments, has suffered a major setback.</p>
<p>I would like to add that this system has left entire regions, including Europe, on the outskirts of global economic processes and has prevented them from adopting key economic and financial decisions.</p>
<p>Moreover, generated prosperity was distributed extremely unevenly among various population strata. This applies to differences between social strata in certain countries, including highly developed ones. And it equally applies to gaps between countries and regions.</p>
<p>A considerable share of the world&#8217;s population still cannot afford comfortable housing, education and quality health care. Even a global recovery posted in the last few years has failed to radically change this situation.</p>
<p>And, finally, this crisis was brought about by excessive expectations. Corporate appetites with regard to constantly growing demand swelled unjustifiably. The race between stock market indices and capitalisation began to overshadow rising labour productivity and real-life corporate effectiveness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, excessive expectations were not only typical of the business community. They set the pace for rapidly growing personal consumption standards, primarily in the industrial world. We must openly admit that such growth was not backed by a real potential. This amounted to unearned wealth, a loan that will have to be repaid by future generations.</p>
<p>This pyramid of expectations would have collapsed sooner or later. In fact, this is happening right before our eyes.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Putin on global imbalances</strong>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The entire economic growth system, where one regional centre prints money without respite and consumes material wealth, while another regional centre manufactures inexpensive goods and saves money printed by other governments, has suffered a major setback.</p>
<p>I would like to add that this system has left entire regions, including Europe, on the outskirts of global economic processes and has prevented them from adopting key economic and financial decisions.</p>
<p>Moreover, generated prosperity was distributed extremely unevenly among various population strata. This applies to differences between social strata in certain countries, including highly developed ones. And it equally applies to gaps between countries and regions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Putin extends the global picture. Note the oblique references to China and the U.S.:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>We must not revert to isolationism and unrestrained economic egotism. The leaders of the world&#8217;s largest economies agreed during the November 2008 G20 summit not to create barriers hindering global trade and capital flows. Russia shares these principles.</p>
<p>Although additional protectionism will prove inevitable during the crisis, all of us must display a sense of proportion.</p>
<p>Excessive intervention in economic activity and blind faith in the state&#8217;s omnipotence is another possible mistake.</p>
<p>True, the state&#8217;s increased role in times of crisis is a natural reaction to market setbacks. Instead of streamlining market mechanisms, some are tempted to expand state economic intervention to the greatest possible extent.</p>
<p>The concentration of surplus assets in the hands of the state is a negative aspect of anti-crisis measures in virtually every nation.</p>
<p>In the 20th century, the Soviet Union made the state&#8217;s role absolute. In the long run, this made the Soviet economy totally uncompetitive. This lesson cost us dearly. I am sure nobody wants to see it repeated. Nor should we turn a blind eye to the fact that the spirit of free enterprise, including the principle of personal responsibility of businesspeople, investors and shareholders for their decisions, is being eroded in the last few months. There is no reason to believe that we can achieve better results by shifting responsibility onto the state.</p>
<p>And one more point: anti-crisis measures should not escalate into financial populism and a refusal to implement responsible macroeconomic policies. The unjustified swelling of the budgetary deficit and the accumulation of public debts are just as destructive as adventurous stock-jobbing.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Putin&#8217;s four step solution to the financial problem</strong>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>We must assess the real situation and write off all hopeless debts and &#8220;bad&#8221; assets.<br />True, this will be an extremely painful and unpleasant process. Far from everyone can accept such measures, fearing for their capitalisation, bonuses or reputation. However, we would &#8220;conserve&#8221; and prolong the crisis, unless we clean up our balance sheets. I believe financial authorities must work out the required mechanism for writing off debts that corresponds to today&#8217;s needs. </li>
<li>It is high time we got rid of virtual money </li>
<li>Excessive dependence on a single reserve currency is dangerous for the global economy. Consequently, it would be sensible to encourage the objective process of creating several strong reserve currencies in the future. It is high time we launched a detailed discussion of methods to facilitate a smooth and irreversible switchover to the new model. </li>
<li>Most nations convert their international reserves into foreign currencies and must therefore be convinced that they are reliable. Those issuing reserve and accounting currencies are objectively interested in their use by other states.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, Putin is calling for a real discussion of the global role of currency itself. (When asked how to avoid currency manipulation for trade advantage, Volcker replied simply, &#8220;Use a universal currency.&#8221; While Putin is not going that route, he is addressing the role of currency in the present crisis.)</p>
<p>
<blockquote>We must strengthen the system of global regulators based on international law and a system of multilateral agreements in order to prevent chaos and unpredictability in such a multipolar world. Consequently, it is very important that we reassess the role of leading international organisations and institutions.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Time permitting, I intend to do a post on Wen Jiabao&#8217;s remarks. (Those remarks are not easily excerpted; apparently they were photographed and then placed in pdf file.)</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>People are talking about regulating credit default swaps (CDS) .</p>
<p>They include Collin Petersen D-Minn who <a href="http://www.thedeal.com/dealscape/2009/01/congress_moves_to_tamp_down_cr.php">proposes making it illegal to own a CDS without owning the underlying instrument </a>(this is absolutely standard for other kinds of insurance).</p>
<p>and <a href="http://www.thedeal.com/dealscape/2009/01/congress_moves_to_tamp_down_cr.php">George Soros who supports the proposal.</a><br />(via <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2009/01/30/extra-credit-friday-edition">Felix Salmon</a>)</p>
<p>A problem, I think, is that it is not clear how people can be forced to keep the underlying instrument, to use it to buy only one CDS etc.</p>
<p>I think there is a very simple regulation which will do the trick.  For all future CDSs, the writer of the CDS is required to make scheduled payments on the instrument to the owner of the CDS if and only if the instrument is in default, and the CDS holder hands over the CDS and the insured instrument.  This is called a physical settlement CDS.  The regulation says that all CDSs written from now on are phyisical settlement CDSs no matter what is said or written in any contract whatsoever or anywhere else.  </p>
<p>The time to check that someone really has suffered damage is when they file a claim.  Then the insurer and the insured have diametrically opposite incentives and won&#8217;t collude to evade the regulation.</p>
<p>Soros has interesting thoughts on the damage done by CDSs which I quote and discuss after the jump</p>
<p>Soros writes</p>
<blockquote><p>Going short on bonds by buying a CDS contract carries limited risk but unlimited profit potential; by contrast, selling credit default swaps offers limited profits but practically unlimited risks.</p>
<p>The asymmetry encourages speculating on the short side, which in turn exerts a downward pressure on the underlying bonds. When an adverse development is expected, the negative effect can become overwhelming because CDS tend to be priced as warrants, not as options: people buy them not because they expect an eventual default but because they expect the CDS to appreciate during the lifetime of the contract.</p>
<p>No arbitrage can correct the mispricing. That can be clearly seen in US and UK government bonds, whose actual price is much higher than that implied by CDS. These asymmetries are difficult to reconcile with the efficient market hypothesis, the notion that securities prices accurately reflect all known information.</p>
<p>The third step is to recognise reflexivity – that is to say, the mispricing of financial instruments can affect the fundamentals that market prices are supposed to reflect. Nowhere is this phenomenon more pronounced than in the case of financial institutions, whose ability to do business is dependent on confidence and trust. That means that “bear raids” to drive down the share prices of these institutions can be self-validating. That is in direct contradiction to the efficient market hypothesis.</p>
<p>Putting these three considerations together leads to the conclusion that Lehman, AIG and other financial institutions were destroyed by bear raids in which the shorting of stocks and buying of CDS amplified and reinforced each other. Unlimited shorting was made possible by the 2007 abolition of the uptick rule (which hindered bear raids by allowing short-selling only when prices were rising). The unlimited selling of bonds was facilitated by the CDS market. Together, the two made a lethal combination.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a bit odd.  Doubts about AIGs solvency should have reduced the value of CDSs written by AIG.  The argument must work via an assumption that there was an attack on the world financial system or something, where fear meant demand for CDSs which brought down AIG which caused fear.  </p>
<p>The argument about asymmetric returns is hard to reconcile with the assumption (never ever made by Soros) that people rationally maximize the expected discounted present value of a stream of utility which is a concave function of consumption.  Obviously Soros thinks that there are compulsive gamblers out there messing up financial markets.  I agree.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see the &#8220;No arbitrage can correct the mispricing. That can be clearly seen in US and UK government bonds, whose actual price is much higher than that implied by CDS.&#8221; argument.  It seems to me that writing CDSs on US and UK government bonds is about as close to riskless arbitrage as one ever gets.  Of course that&#8217;s what they thought at AIG too.  Given the requirement on posting collateral, one needs deep pockets to profit from the mispricing.  I think the US should insure UK debt and vice versa.  I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d both make a profit.</p>

<blockquote><p>The climate is warm, there&#8217;s no shortage of exotic food, and the cost of living is rock bottom. That&#8217;s IBM (NYSE: IBM)&#8217;s pitch to the laid-off American workers it&#8217;s offering to place in India. The catch: Wages in the country are pennies-on-the-dollar compared to U.S. salaries.</p>
<p>Under a program called Project Match, IBM will help workers laid off from domestic sites obtain travel and visa assistance for countries in which Big Blue has openings. Mostly that&#8217;s developing markets like India, China, and Brazil.</p>
<p>&#8220;IBM has established Project Match to help you locate potential job opportunities in growth markets where your skills are in demand,&#8221; IBM says in an internal notice on the initiative. &#8220;Should you accept a position in one of these countries, IBM offers financial assistance to offset moving costs, provides immigration support, such as visa assistance, and other support to help ease the transition of an international move.&#8221;</p>
<p>The document states that the program is limited to &#8220;satisfactory performers who have been notified of separation from IBM U.S. or Canada and are willing to work on local terms and conditions.&#8221; The latter indicates that workers will be paid according to prevailing norms in the countries to which they relocate. In many cases, that could be substantially less than what they earned in North America.</p>
<p>IBM has laid off more than 4,000 workers in the United States since the beginning of January, according to an employee group. The company has confirmed layoffs but won&#8217;t comment on specific numbers.(bolding mine)</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Well the gloves came off this morning. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/02/gop.stimulus.worries/index.html">What GOP Leaders deem wasteful in Senate stimulus bill</a><br />
<blockquote>STORY HIGHLIGHTS<br />House Republicans unveil list of &#8220;wasteful&#8221; Senate stimulus spending<br />Stimulus bill passed in the House without any Republican support<br />One provision: A $246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers<br />Another concern: $75 million for salaries of employees at the FBI</p></blockquote>
<p>I have listed all the line items below the fold divided into five categories. 1)  &#8216;Spending that could use some explanation&#8217; This includes that Hollywood tax break (hint the four words left out of Highlights make a difference) 2) Equipment purchases 3) Building and Infrastructure 4) Public Health 5) Jobs.</p>
<p>Let us set some parameters. There is a distinction between &#8216;wasteful&#8217;  and &#8216;inefficient&#8217;. That is there is spending that may not meet somebody&#8217;s policy preferences (wasteful)  but still has stimulative effects over the short term. And then there is spending that everyone agrees would be useful but which doesn&#8217;t go into effect fast enough. If you look at the Republican list as it shows in the original story these two categories are blurred and blended with no real explanations as to which they consider which.</p>
<p>Jobs. $3.185 billion If the major challenge facing us short term is unemployment then direct spending on jobs is a pretty efficient way to inject money into the system. And certainly better than just extending unemployment insurance (though we need to do some of that too). Which makes Republican opposition on this front a little odd to start with, particularly when we examine the first three line items. $1 billion for the Census. Well this is one of the very few specific Constitutional mandates, we have to do it good times or bad, as it happens we will be needing census workers right at the point we are projecting our greatest rate of unemployment. Exactly how does this fall in the category of &#8216;wasteful&#8217;? Particularly since there is a $3 billion gap between authorization and projected costs? I don&#8217;t get it. $75 million for FBI salaries. We got news stories last week showing that the FBI was aware of major mortgage fraud but had diverted existing resources to counterterror duties. Unless you believe that Wall Street reformed itself overnight it is hard to see why this is in any sense &#8216;wasteful&#8217;. Not only do we need the Agents this translates directly to jobs. $650 million for wildfire management. Translation: fire crews. In recent years for whatever reason the fire season has been getting longer and more destructive and the Forest Service has consistently blown through its fire fighting budget requiring diversions from other programs. Plus these are great opportunities to get young workers into the work force in jobs that allow on the job training. Economic efficiency and public safety combined, yet it made the list. The other three line items which total $1.46 billion merit some discussion but all translate directly into jobs that offer on the job training and which also can be put in place quickly. The GOP seems to be straining here.</p>
<p>Public Health $500 million dollars. Prevention of STDs $400 million. Prevention of any infectious disease translates to productivity improvements. The apparent basis for including this on the list is that the GOP would rather have people get sick than let women have access to reproductive controls. It is all about the condoms. The remaining $100 million is for smoking cessation and tribal alcohol abuse. You can make the economic argument for either but really this is a joke. We are talking about .012% of the package here. It just seems that the GOP hates spending any tax money on public goods.</p>
<p>Building and infrastructure. At $10.6 billion by far the largest category. And while you can argue the merits of spending $6 billion upgrading Federal buildings to make them more &#8220;green&#8221; (which sounds more wasteful than calling it what it is &#8220;more energy efficient&#8221;) all of these projects translate directly into jobs. It is just hard to see the economic argument at work here. Plus you have to have a heart as hard as a stone to reach way down into the package to highlight $5.5 million in spending at the VA National Cemetary Administration. That is .0006% of the total. (And yes the money is probably going to be spent at headquarters, but still the symbolism stinks).</p>
<p>Equipment. $1.8 billion. Maybe the Coast Guard doesn&#8217;t need a new icebreaker. On the other hand polar nations are in a scramble to establish claims to newly reachable gas and oil resources on the Arctic Sea floor. $88 million doesn&#8217;t seem like a lot to spend to beef up our arctic presence. I have no idea why this made the cut. But the rest is pretty explicable. The Republicans have always hated Amtrak ($850 million) and typically poo-poo &#8220;green&#8221; anything including alternative energy vehicles ($800 million). But it is hard to see the economic argument against any of this.</p>
<p>Which leaves us with $2.9 billion in what reasonably could be seen as pork. $2 billion for a clean coal plant defunded last year on grounds of &#8220;inefficiency&#8221;. Maybe Dr. Chu has some ideas about how to correct the problem but it doesn&#8217;t look good on the surface. $650 million on TV convertor boxes. Well there is a public policy case to be made here, but considering the units are probably made in Malaysia or China, the economic case seems shakier. And that tax break for Hollywood producers. Like those guys need more money. On the other hand the actual tax break is for buying motion picture film. So maybe there is an economic case to be made that this creates jobs. On the Left Coast. So it is easy to see why this made the cut. But $2.9 billion is only about .4% of the whole package.</p>
<p>In fact if we add it all together (which the original article doesn&#8217;t) we are a shade under $19 billion or 2.15%. Sorry this is not an economic argument for waste or inefficiency, they simply threw everything they could into the mix and created a laundry list to give some cover to their real agenda. Which is as it has always been-tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>has been rather harsh on efforts to base macroeconomics on models of rational forward looking utility maximisers in Nash or Walrasian equilibrium recently.</p>
<p>One might almost think that I agree with my PhD supervisor Larry Summers who once said and I quote from memory (but believe me the words had enough of an impact that I remember them and where we were and who else was there).</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what I think ? I think that in the history of economic theory the day in which they came up with the idea of the utility function wasn&#8217;t an especially good day.&#8221;</p>
<p>To make things clear, I do think that major insights have been obtained by economists who introduced the concept of the utlity function not just to economics but also to macroeconomics.  The problem is that I almost think that those economists are named either Milton or Friedman.  After the jump, I will attempt to argue that the concept of the utility function is sometimes useful and sometimes even useful to people trying to study aggregates.</p>
<p>First of all, context.  Larry was proposing an effort to explain the S&#038;P 500 index using models of deterministic chaos.  Existing models with chaotic dynamics had no forward looking element &#8212; they were models of weather or insect populations and no one assumed that either clouds or grasshoppers had rational expectations.  </p>
<p>So I read up on deterministic chaos and programmed up the models he considered.  They generated time series.  The time series didn&#8217;t look like the S&#038;P because they were highly predictable.  I concluded that you really have to consider agents who look at the data and try to predict the future and can tell if there is a simple pattern.  My version is that these agents eliminated the simple cycles and left the chaotic dynamics because they couldn&#8217;t figure them out.  But see I was back to agents with an objective who were at least learning.</p>
<p>Of course my discovery can be found in basically every introductory micro textbook.</p>
<p>OK so what about Milton and Friedman.  I&#8217;d say he had two major contributions which have something to do with considering economic agents&#8217; objectives.  One is the accelerationist critique of the Phillips curve (see &#8220;The role of monetary policy&#8221; a presidential address in the AER).  Here he says that the old Phillips curve which related nominal wage growth to unemployment and nothing else couldn&#8217;t possibly be an economic law true in all times and all places, because incentives all concern real wages and it&#8217;s just not possible that people won&#8217;t notice a constant inflation rate of x%.  Note, this is a critique of the totally stubborn and dumb expectations hypothesis.  You don&#8217;t have to assume rational expectations to conclude that expectations have something to do with reality.</p>
<p>Good point.  Definitely a true claim as the Phillips curve fit UK data and, as noted by Samuelson and Solow US data but didn&#8217;t fit German data from 1918 through 1924 so well.  </p>
<p>Ned Phelps made the same point, so I have to admit that the concept of the objective function was put to good use by macroeconomists whose last name begins with the same sound as the phrase &#8220;false dawn&#8221;.</p>
<p>then there is the permanent income hypothesis.  Here the glass is definitely at least half full.  It is really true that economists struggled to explain strange patterns in the data, all of which seemed to be not in the slightest strange once Friedman and Franco Modigliani (OK macroeconomists one of whose names begins with the same sound as the phrase &#8220;false dawn&#8221;) began thinking about consumption savings choice as a problem in optimization.</p>
<p>For example, why is it that the rich save a larger fraction of their income than the poor yet as the economy grows and people on average get richer the ratio of consumption to income stays about the same (or later grew) ?</p>
<p>Why do African Americans have a higher savings rate than European Americans with the same income ?</p>
<p>Why is there a lower regression coefficient of consumption on income for US farmers than for other Americans ?</p>
<p>All these facts are exactly what you would expect if at least part of consumption corresponded to consumption in the PIH.</p>
<p>Now when one attempts to test the PIH (is the glass fully full) one discovers the same 2 things one always discovers.  When on attempts to test hypotheses based on rational utility maximization one rejects them, but one always has to make auxiliary hypotheses and someone will argue that the rejection was due to the auxiliary hypothesis. </p>
<p>The rejection of the PIH with rational expectations is especially robust as those people will argue that rejection is due to an auxiliary hypothesis, because they can relax that assumption and get to a model in which the null is rejected at the 5% level but not at the 1% level.  </p>
<p>But one can also reject the null that the PIH has nothing to do with consumption along with auxiliary unless and until someone finds a way to explain the stylized facts listed above, without assuming that at least part of consumption of at least some people corresponds to PIH consumption.</p>
<p>Milton Friedman has many disciples.  Have they added a third victory based on applying micro theory to macro ?  This is not a rhetorical question, I am asking for information.</p>
