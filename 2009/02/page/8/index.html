<p>A couple of commenters here have inquired about how Social Security would fare in a time of extended recession. And the really short answer is &#8216;not too badly, mostly it self-adjusts&#8217;. But the questions reveal a profound misunderstanding of the real nature of the Trust Funds and their relation to Social Security solvency. So before talking about the self-adjustment we need to step back a bit and consider what the Trust Funds really are.</p>
<p>Most of the confusion comes from thinking that the Trust Funds are an investment instrument. Which confusion is compounded by the belief that this &#8216;investment instrument&#8217; was created in the course of the 1983 Reform as a temporary measure to at least in part handle the challenge of Boomer retirement. Neither is true.</p>
<p>Taking the latter point first. The Trust Fund was established with the original Social Security Act something that can be easily seen by the heading of the first  <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/trust/tf1941.html">Report to Congress</a> in 1941.<br />
<blockquote>Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund,<br />Washington, D.C. January 3, 1941</p>
<p>We have the honor to transmit to you the First Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund, in compliance with the provisions of section 201(b) of the Social Security Act, as amended.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Trust Funds have grown and shrunk over time when expressed as a ratio of reserve to cost and have always earned interest but were never, ever intended to be an investment instrument, not in 1936, not in 1983, and not now. Which makes arguments about ROI irrelevant in context, people are letting the earnings tail wag the Pay-Go dog. To get a better idea of what the function of the Trust Fund really is you need to follow me under the fold.</p>
<p>The Trust Funds are best thought of as two interest earning savings accounts. Each month they are automatically credited with receipts from taxation of wages and benefits, and each month they are debited for benefits paid out, and then are credited again for interest on the balance giving in turn a new balance. And really that is all the regular taxpayer beneficiary needs to know, the money is in the bank and guaranteed by the Federal Government just as your savings are in a FDIC bank. In normal times people need not worry about how the bank handles the money, even if it goes broke your holdings are insured. Well the same is true for Social Security, the Trust Funds operationally being just savings accounts insured by the government.</p>
<p>But of course these are not normal times and banks are failing at a rapid rate. Moreover those that still survive are choking on instruments routinely described as &#8216;toxic waste&#8217;. So it is no wonder people worry about the security of the instruments backing up the Trust Fund. Are the Special Treasuries that actually make the Trust Fund up real? And are they safe?</p>
<p>Well yes and yes. Largely because what is by many seen as a weakness is actually their strength. Special Treasuries are like regular Treasuries notes that have fixed face values and interest rates. Unlike regular Treasuries they are not marketable. Which leads some to claim they are not real &#8216;assets&#8217; at all. This is to get things backwards. Because the Social Security Trustees always hold these notes to maturity their value is always and exactly the face value and the yield is exactly equal to the stated interest rate. Which means that the existing portfolio is sheltered from fluctuations in the outside bond market. You could sum this up with the phrase &#8216;No market. No mark to market.&#8217; The Trust Funds as such cannot be wiped out absent the total collapse of Full Faith and Credit of the United States. Which maybe could happen but would leave us with much bigger things to worry about than future retirement security.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that the Trust Funds are totally immune to economic downturn. Each year a portion of the Trust Fund portfolio of Special Treasuries matures and if Social Security is in surplus immediately reinvested in new ones at current interest rates. If we examine the actual portfolio of in this case OAS (Old Age Survivors) we will see that bonds that matured in 2008 had interest rates ranging from 3.5% to 7.25% <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_cyoper_history.html#152208">Table VI.A5.—Assets of the OASI Trust Fund, End of Calendar Years 2006 and 2007[In thousands]</a>. To the extent that these had to be replaced by new ones with lower rates than predicted when the year began then Social Security takes a mild future hit. But only on the difference in rates on the relatively small portion of the portfolio that matured last year, none of this has any effect on say the $27,311,591,000 in 2009 bonds that are still yielding 7.25%.</p>
<p>But even that is to obscure the story somewhat. In 2008 Social Security ran a cash surplus of about $80 billion dollars from the excess of receipts from taxation over cost. To which we would add about $100 billion in accrued interest for a total increase in the Trust Fund of $180.9 billion. This compares to a original projection of $196.2 billion. So we have $15.3 billion less in principal than expected plus some new additions to the portfolio with a somewhat less than expected yield on bonds issued over the course of the year. But $15.3 billion amounts to just 0.6% of the existing Trust Fund balance. Even if we do hit 9% unemployment for most of 2009 that would probably mean no more than roughly triple that amount less in projected year end balances. That is against an Intermediate Cost projection of $2.647 trillion we might end up with something closer to $2.59 trillion. Which is still a Trust Fund in overall surplus, something that is maybe not as likely for your 401k over the same period.</p>
<p>As long as Social Security is in cash surplus the variation in earnings on the Trust Fund balances is mostly irrelevant, it has some implications for solvency in around 2040 but really nothing for current recipients to worry about and not really much for people approaching retirement. Even an extended period of slow growth doesn&#8217;t change that fact much because Social Security still is what it almost always has been, a Pay-Go system.</p>
<p>Now as to self-adjustment. A normal recession is marked both by low inflation or even deflation and higher levels of unemployment. And the latter might well have an effect on real wage. But these interact in complex ways when it comes to judging solvency in a Pay-Go system.</p>
<p>Unemployment directly reduces revenues in exact proportion to wages not paid, that is 12.4% of payroll dollars not collected.</p>
<p>Flat real wages also reduces revenues when compared to baseline assumptions. But given that initial retirement benefits are set by real wage over the worker&#8217;s work life, flat real wages reduce future costs.</p>
<p>Low inflation reduces costs short term in that current benefits are adjusted annually for inflation. It also serves to lower costs long term because it lowers the benefit baseline that will exist at the end of the period of inflation. While it is possible that a sharp and continuing period of growth after recovery would add those costs back in, it might not. For example the strong improvement in Social Security outlook experienced in the late 1990s was the result of a fortuitous combination of high employment and low inflation that put revenues above projected baselines and costs below.</p>
<p>Under normal conditions the various formulas that set initial benefits to real wage and continuing benefits to inflation combine to deliver a pretty steady state outcome for Social Security when taken in terms of income replacement. Social Security recipients now and in the future see their fortunes mostly rising and falling as the economy does, benefitting from or suffering somewhat in much the same way their grandchildren do.</p>
<p>But let me finish with a caveat. The late 90s were great for Social Security-high employment and real wage increases combined with low inflation took an outlook that in 1996 still merited the word &#8216;crisis&#8217; or at least &#8216;pending problem&#8217; and mostly erased it for good. On the other hand the late 70s took a Social Security system that had been pretty stable for decades and almost put it into the ditch. This was due to stagflation where the combination of high inflation increasing costs and slow growth decreasing revenues put Social Security right on a path for Trust Fund depletion. If we enter a new period of stagflation triggered by something like another oil shock then all bets are off. But then again your equity investments will probably not be looking rosy either.</p>
<p>So Social Security can well weather even a prolonged recession. But neither it or us will fare well in a perma-depression. A lot depends on whether the various Obama plans for banks/stimulus/universal coverage/energy independence work. Which is where everyone should be focusing their attention and not on some time-wasting &#8216;Entitlements Summit&#8217;.</p>

                                <p>Guest Post by Gordon</p>
<p>In a recent blog <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/02/toxic-assets-bad-bank-or-guarantees.html" target="_blank">post</a>, Duy and Magud said that current discussion about banks’ balance sheets has &#8220;converged&#8221; to either offering government guarantees or creating a &#8220;bad bank.&#8221;</p>
<p>I don’t know where they get their ideas of &#8220;current discussion&#8221; from, but they’re obviously not listening very hard. Two options that have escaped their attention as far as banking rescue goes are nationalization and the creation of a new, National Bank. They’ve obviously missed Stormy’s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/bernanke-had-thought-then-another-and.html" target="_blank">post</a>, as well as several others.</p>
<p>Both nationalization and the creation of a new National Bank have as their objective the freeing up of banks to act like banks again, and lend to creditworthy borrowers in the &#8220;real economy.&#8221; Anybody who thinks that this isn’t necessary might read this blog <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/10/there-is-a-cred.html" target="_blank">post</a> on the credit crunch.</p>
<p>Nationalization has been widely called for. There are two possibilities: The government buys the bank or seizes the bank’s assets as per FDIC procedure with bankrupt banks in &#8220;normal times&#8221; – only this time it doesn’t on-sell the assets, but instead it continues to operate the bank. Either procedure leads to Government-owned and operated banks.</p>
<p>Creation of a new bank doesn’t involve purchase or seizure of sick banks’ assets. The Government simply initially capitalizes a new bank that is run as a commercial bank and makes loans to the creditworthy in the &#8220;real economy.&#8221; The National Bank pays an agreed and reasonable rate of return to the Treasury on its capital. It will work directly and immediately to help end the credit crunch, giving people a bank they can confidently lend to and make deposits in. Just to fix the idea in people’s minds, I originally called it &#8220;The Commonwealth Bank of the United States&#8221; when I first advocated the idea back in March last <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistview/2008/03/fixing-financia.html#c106844230" target="_blank">year</a>. People also refer to the idea as simply a National Bank or a Government Bank. It has even been called a &#8220;Good Bank,&#8221; in order to point up the difference from &#8220;bad bank&#8221; proposals.</p>
<p>Prof. Buiter (LSE)[<a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/01/the-good-bank-solution/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/02/good-banknew-bank-vs-bad-bank-a-rare-example-of-a-no-brainer/" target="_blank">here</a>] and Prof. Romer [<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123388681675555343.html" target="_blank">here</a>] (Stanford) have now presented proposals for a National Bank. Prof Buiter notes (see second linked post) that Prof. Stiglitz has given the idea a passing nod of approval. Both Buiter and Stiglitz have previously supported nationalization, so it&#8217;s interesting to see their ideas moving forward.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that Prof. Buiter’s proposal is complex, having features of nationalization and &#8220;bad banks&#8221; in it as well. He is obviously trying to work out the futures of the existing &#8220;troubled&#8221; banks at the same time as proposing a new, National Bank (or National Banks, because his proposal could involve several). His ideas are interesting but I think need some more work, and I won&#8217;t go into details here.</p>
<p>One of the problems with nationalization is the need to recapitalise. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123371182830346215.html" target="_blank">George Soros</a> has estimated that $1.5 trillion will be needed to recapitalize existing sick banks. That is a lot of money, but the real issue is that Governments going the nationalization route don&#8217;t have any choice. Solvency is solvency, its arithmetic of assets and liabilities, and nationalization commits a government to paying whatever is necessary. Creation of a new National Bank allows the Government to make an independent decision about the amount of initial capitalization. Then, as Prof. Romer says, it allows the new National Bank to (modestly) leverage that initial capital:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>The government has $350 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) funds that it can use to encourage new bank lending. If this money is directed to newly created good banks[sic] with pristine balance sheets, it could support $3.5 trillion in new lending with a modest 9-to-1 leverage.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Some people also are troubled by the idea of a National Bank being a toy for politicians. This objection would apply equally to nationalized banks, of course. To avoid this, we must ensure that the National Bank is run at arm’s length from Government, just as Social Security is run at arm’s length. Its accounts would need to be audited, and Congress would probably want to approve the audit (it put up the initial capital). Some people will always say Government can&#8217;t do this, but the examples of SS and the New Deal programs show that Government agencies can be run in a trustworthy and transparent way.</p>
<p>The real issue with &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; is ensuring that the new National Bank is run conservatively. Its charter needs to be written in a way that allows it to do all the things that a commercial bank can do within reasonable risk parameters. Credit cards at reasonable rates? Sure. Loans for cars and house improvements? Absolutely. Student Loans? No problem. Business loans? Of course. But all these lines of business need to be managed so that credit is extended to the creditworthy.</p>
<p>Speculation in risky, high-yielding derivatives would be out, as would credit for deserving but not really creditworthy applicants. The National Bank shouldn’t try to do the things that the Government. is currently preparing to use fiscal policy to do. It isn’t a stimulus package. You may need to be careful, but I don’t think it’s impossible. Is the TARP &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; any less?</p>
<p>A third problem that is often raised is the sheer logistical difficulty of starting up a new National Bank from scratch. I like to point out how quickly and efficiently Americans can set up campaign offices during elections. Space is rented, furniture and equipment are rented and moved in, staff are hired and volunteers mobilized all in a few days. And the US Federal Goverment has a big existing network of offices nationwide which should make the problem easier. Maybe a National Bank would be difficult to set up in places which aren&#8217;t so good as logistics, but I just don’t see this would be a problem if the US Government really wanted to do it.</p>
<p>Some proposals envisage the privatization of a National Bank at some time in the future when &#8220;normalcy&#8221; has returned. I don’t. I would advocate a continuing Govt.-owned Commonwealth Bank of the United States. First, because privatizing a National bank is itself an exercise fraught with &#8220;moral hazard&#8221;. It would be too easy to sell it off cheap to political connections. Secondly, because a continuing Government. bank run conservatively and transparently would contrast dramatically with the murky and opaque bank management practices which have led to the current debacle. This would, I believe, assist the regulatory reforms that will also have to be made but which will take a longer. The National bank would set a benchmark. Call it &#8220;regulation by example&#8221;. Thirdly, because it would provide a continuing source of income to the Nation through the Federal Government.  Why unload a good and secure investment?</p>
<p>What would happen to existing &#8220;troubled&#8221; banks? I don’t know. Maybe the Federal Government will find a way to rescue them. Maybe the new Geithner plan will eventually work. The National Bank will be out there taking deposits and lending in the meantime, but not speculating in risky derivatives or making too-risky loans.</p>

                                <p>Mark Thoma at Economist&#8217;s View links us to the following article from William Grieder at The Nation.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090302/greider?rel=hp_currently">Looting Social Security</a><br />
<blockquote>Governing elites in Washington and Wall Street have devised a fiendishly clever &#8220;grand bargain&#8221; they want President Obama to embrace in the name of &#8220;fiscal responsibility.&#8221; The government, they argue, having spent billions on bailing out the banks, can recover its costs by looting the Social Security system. They are also targeting Medicare and Medicaid. The pitch sounds preposterous to millions of ordinary working people anxious about their economic security and worried about their retirement years. But an impressive armada is lined up to push the idea&#8211;Washington&#8217;s leading think tanks, the prestige media, tax-exempt foundations, skillful propagandists posing as economic experts and a self-righteous billionaire spending his fortune to save the nation from the elderly.</p></blockquote>
<p> The &#8220;self-righteous billionaire&#8221; is of course our old friend Peter. G. Peterson. How do they propose to do this? With the oldest trick in the book, get some corporate funded think tankers from the center, combine them with corporate funded think tankers from the right and call the effort &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217;.<br />
<blockquote>Peterson&#8217;s proposal would essentially dismantle the Social Security entitlement enacted in the New Deal, much as Bill Clinton repealed the right to welfare. Peterson has assembled influential allies for this radical step. They include a coalition of six major think tanks and four tax-exempt foundations.<br />Their report&#8211;<u>Taking Back Our Fiscal Future</u>, issued jointly by the Brookings Institution and the Heritage Foundation&#8211;recommends that Congress put long-term budget caps on Social Security and other entitlement spending, which would automatically trigger benefits cuts if needed to stay within the prescribed limits. The same antidemocratic mechanisms&#8211;a commission of technocrats and limited Congressional discretion&#8211;would shield politicians from popular blowback.<br />The authors of this plan are sixteen economists from Brookings and Heritage, joined by the American Enterprise Institute, the Concord Coalition, the New America Foundation, the Progressive Policy Institute and the Urban Institute. &#8220;Our group covers the ideological spectrum,&#8221; they claim. This too is a falsehood. All these organizations are corporate-friendly and dependent on big-money contributors. No liberal or labor thinkers need apply, though the group includes some formerly liberal economists like Robert Reischauer, Alice Rivlin and Isabel Sawhill.</p></blockquote>
<p>The report itself can be found here <a target="_blank" href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2008/04_fiscal_future/04_fiscal_future.pdf">Taking Back our Fiscal Future</a> but really there is nothing new here, just a recitation of the standard talking points.</p>
<p>A commenter at my blog asked me if I could just put the case for &#8216;Nothing&#8217; as a plan for Social Security in a condensed form and I had to confess &#8216;Well no, in fact my effort to explain this has reached 66 posts&#8217; <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/08/angry-bear-social-security-series.html">Angry Bear Social Security Series</a> but what the heck I&#8217;ll try to boil it down under the fold.<br />Bottom line: Social Security does not need to be fixed anytime in the next 18 years. We don&#8217;t need to increase retirement ages, we don&#8217;t need to lift the payroll cap (and I don&#8217;t care how progressive that sounds). Fundamentally it is not broken.</p>
<p>1. If you grant the critics every economic and demographic assumption the payroll gap is currently 1.7%. Don&#8217;t let them spook you with percentages of GDP or anything else, do the arithmetic. If we assume the employer/employee split holds the cost of a permanent fix for a household earning $50,000 is $425 per year. When you see any other plan proposed ask yourself if the combination of benefit cuts and tax increases is more or less than that. If it is more then why bother? (Hint generally it is much more with not much better results.)</p>
<p>2. Initial benefits under Social Security increase with real wage which prior to Bush II have tended to increase over time. Meaning Social Security is a mildly better deal each year when measured as a basket of goods (the income replacement percentage stays pretty constant). Under the current schedule the benefit in 2040, the last year when full benefits are projected to be paid, would be 160% of the 2009 benefit. In 2041 it would have to be reset to 78% of that. As Prof. Rosser of JMU pointed out to me long ago 78% of 160% is 125%. Well actually that is not precisely right, when he presented me with what I call Rosser&#8217;s Equation the projected cut was to 75% giving us 75% of 160% = 120%. In any event that is what &#8216;Crisis&#8217; is in numeric context, a real benefit 25% better than the one my Mom gets today.</p>
<p>3. The improvement from a 75% benefit to a 78% benefit simply tracks other metrics. In 1997 the Trust Fund was projected to go to depletion in 2029 and the fix was an immediate increase in payroll taxes of 2.23%. With the 2008 Report that date had been pushed back to 2041 and the gap down to <s>2.23%</s> 1.7% (h/t Arne) . I am sure there is an apt word for a problem that left unaddressed gets pushed back in time and whose cost to fix shrinks. That word is not crisis.</p>
<p>4. Under the various Social Security Acts the health of Social Security is measured in terms of Short Term and Long Term Actuarial Balance. Moreover the two components of OAS (Old Age Survivors) and DI (Disability Insurance) are officially tracked separately. Meaning when Dean Baker or me tell you Social Security is fully funded until 2041 (SSA) or 2049 (CBO) we are mildly fibbing. Because DI is scheduled to run out somewhat before OAS. But the Trustees talk in the same terms, they talk about the combined Trust Funds running out at some fixed date requiring an immediate cut. But that is not how the system actually works.</p>
<p>The Trust Funds are typically scored by Trust Fund Ratio which is simply the ratio of the TF balance to projected cost in any given year where 100=1 year. If the combined Trust Funds are projected to have TF ratios over 100 in each of the following 10 years they are deemed to be in Short Term Actuarial Balance. If the combined TFs are projected to have TF ratios over 100 in each of the following 75 years they are deemed to be in Long Term Actuarial Balance. Officially the Trustees are mandated to alert Congress when they TFs go out of Short Term Actuarial Balance so that they can consider adjusting the tax/benefit ratio. Which is to say it is unlikely that the Trust Funds will ever go to Depletion or that there would ever be a wrenching dislocation. Instead the country would have ten plus years to plan and adjust after the TFs fall out of balance.</p>
<p>As noted above the actual date of Trust Fund depletion and so the time that the TFs fall out of Short Term Balance has been steadily pushed back in time and in fact at a combined rate that suggests at least a strong possibility that it will never actually happen. In fact there is a reasonably plausible scenario provided by the Trustees that would have Social Security left unaddressed be much overfunded after mid-century. This scenario which is called Low Cost would have us soon debating whether the best policy was to cut FICA or increase benefits. Which needless to say is a conversation that 99.9% of the population doesn&#8217;t even dream possible.</p>
<p>So I suggest that there is a logical time to move on Social Security which is in fact dictated by current law. We can and should wait until the Trust Funds actually fall out of balance which is to say 9 years before the TF ratio is projected to fall below 100. Under current projections that date is set at about 2038 meaning we would need to start planning to adjust the system around 2029. Unless of course things continue to improve.</p>
<p>But there is exactly no reason to move on this in the near future. Because those that insist that &#8216;we can&#8217;t afford to wait&#8217; and &#8216;delay will only make the fix harder&#8217; are dead wrong. Because 12 years of delay have left us with a much smaller projected fix.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table IV.B3.—Estimated Trust Fund Ratios, Calendar Years 2008-85[In percent]</a></p>

<p>Reader Roger Senserrich listened to the Obama reply that also caught <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CalculatedRisk/~3/UQhzy0nhDR0/obama-on-nationalization.html">CR&#8217;s</a> eye and sends a relatively favorable (to the administration) interpretation:<br />
<blockquote>Let´s see if it makes sense.</p>
<p>1. Obama says that America doesn´t nationalize; it is not something we do. That´s actually false; ask IndyMac or WaMu shareholders on what hit them. The FDIC does nationalize.<br />2. The political system, however, does not perceive it as the &#8220;N&#8221; word. There was little backlash against those actions, as the FDIC is seen as non-political; some sort of a technocratic guardian that does what is needed.<br />3. Enter the stress test: Geithner talks about testing the banks to see if they can swim in these troubled waters. Only some banks; the 14 with assets over 100 billion, will take this wonderful &#8220;test&#8221;. Depending on how well they fare, they will get more or less capital, and the treasury will grab more or less stock.</p>
<p>See where am I going? The administration could be looking for a way to benchmark and nationalize what is needed using a technocratic procedure with a clear way out, as a way of doing the work with some political cover. Essentially, the idea is to get the &#8220;N&#8221; word out of the debate, and make it about banks getting &#8220;intervined&#8221; after failing to comply with the &#8220;agency&#8221;´s regulations.</p>
<p>It is convoluted, and I might be looking for a rationale that is not actually there, but it makes sense; it gives them a way to do what is needed without actually having to name it. Nationalization might be economically necessary, but is not politically feasible; this could be a way to create political cover for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tom here. For another sympathetic view, see <a href="http://content.ksg.harvard.edu/blog/jeff_frankels_weblog/">Jeff Frankel</a>.  I read Obama&#8217;s statement through the filter that Obama is a smart lawyer and note that he&#8217;s foreclosed nothing going forward; the money quote in my view is that what we&#8217;ve seen so far represents &#8220;some of the tough love that&#8217;s going to be necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Geithner and Summers could yet find their pictures attached to the Wikipedia entry on regulatory capture, but we also need to avoid reacting as if we&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.pynchon.net/Gravitys_Rainbow_Reference/part_1_beyond_the_zero.aspx">overconditioned</a> to eight years of life under <a href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2003/02/and-another-hit-and-run-i-find-myself.html">Davies&#8217; Law</a>.  This is not to counsel against vigilance with respect to the administration&#8217;s deeds so much as to suggest a la Frankel that the &#8220;they have no clue and the Obama presidency has already failed&#8221; reactions are at least premature.</p>
<p>The political issue is not irrelevant.  Policies that don&#8217;t need to go through Congress would appear to operate under the constraint that it has to be able to be done with $350B in TARP Part II funds, the exercise of various Fed powers in coordination with Treasury, and whatever TARP Part I funds get paid back by institutions who think they can live without help from a Treasury less pliant than Paulson&#8217;s.  Those resources are substantial but not unlimited.  A program that requires more than that needs to deal with the likelihood of opposition from most of the Party of No&#8217;s representation plus other politicians capable of detecting that another dip into public funds for the financial services industry, however necessary, is likely to rival plague for popularity.  At least as frightening as the problem that the <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/NakedCapitalism/~3/LpVDTgBsbIo/bank-stress-testing-less-than-meets-eye.html">&#8220;stress test&#8221; is window dressing</a> is the likely size of the caucus who&#8217;d vote against an expanded bailout were the evidence of necessity delivered by the ghost of Ayn Rand herself.  In fact, I&#8217;d say that right now there&#8217;s no way a bailout expansion would pass.</p>
<p>That seems to put a premium on cleverly engineering a plan to the aforementioned resources.  That may be observationally indistinguishable from a lack of boldness.</p>

                                <p>rdan<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/120162-china-s-three-no-s-to-the-u-s-is-washington-listening">Simon Smelt</a> at Seeking Alpha discusses how the US and China are &#8220;communicating&#8221; national interests.  He points to three important, very broad messages needing interpretation and analysis:</p>
<p>In summary:<br />
<blockquote>1. In 2005 a bilateral Strategic Economic Dialogue (SED) between China and the U.S. was set up. Reportedly, Beijing has put a lot of effort into this and sees the SED as the primary channel for dealing with pressing economic issues. It is the mechanism for dialogue between the G2 on strategic issues, including those of worldwide importance.</p>
<p>What all this boils down to is that China expects to be involved in the big decisions. The message is:</p>
<p>No more U.S. hegemony in the financial world</p>
<p>Lacking a suitable multi-national mechanism (memo from China: “don’t blame us – we’ve been calling for one”), the G2 will do fine instead.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>2. The U.S. has long run a trade deficit with China. The U.S. fiscal deficit by the government is more recent. It stems from the Bush years and is about to get much worse due to the various bail-out and stimulus packages. The Chinese can scarcely object to the trade deficit – they have funded it for years. So, the message is: don’t rely on us to buy your extra bond issues caused by your economic mismanagement.</p>
<p>So, the second Chinese “No”:</p>
<p>No extra U.S. bond purchases by China above the normal level</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>3. No policies that could lead to sharp depreciation of the U.S. $</p>
<p>The danger here is of loose monetary policy pushing inflation sharply higher or other measures undermining confidence in the U.S. $. Debt could be inflated away. I’ve commented before on the dangers for China here. Exaggerating just a bit I said “Imagine, U.S. to China in 2015: “Here’s the trillion we owe you. Buy yourself a beer with it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Smelt&#8217;s final answer/interpretation:</p>
<p>You’ve been bad but let’s still do business. Here’s our terms.</p>
<p>US response to date, given only public statements and no new trade agreements:</p>
<blockquote><p>We do know that Treasury Secretary Geithner – quoting President Obama in aid – effectively threatened China. He accused China on Jan. 22 of “manipulating” their currency, the yuan, to give an unfair advantage to its exporters and suggested U.S. action might eventuate.</p>
<p>Geithner’s message appears contradictory because he also spoke of Obama’s concern for a “strong” U.S. $. So, that’s a “strong” $ except for, err, the Chinese Yuan. In fact, this does make sense. The strong dollar remark is perhaps signaling:</p>
<p> Yes, the U.S. government will act to avoid hyper inflation or sharp depreciation of the dollar.</p>
<p>The currency manipulation remark is saying to the Chinese:</p>
<p>You can do your bit too.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Rdan&#8230;.no bashing here, but the relationship needs a thorough assessment&#8230;I see Angry Bear also addressing the issues in a straight forward way)</p>

<p><a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/02/economics_does.html">Arnold Kling</a> (via Matt Yglesias) argues that economists agree more about microeconomics than about macroeconomics.</p>
<blockquote><p>My take on this is that the consensus of economists is likely to be more reliable on microeconomic issues than it is on macroeconomic issues. In my view, fundamental macroeconomic issues are unsettled. It makes sense to have what a Bayesian statistician would call “diffuse priors” and what an ordinary layman would call an open mind. […] What is important to bear in mind is that just because economists cannot settle disputes about macro does not mean that all of economics is bunk or that nowhere is there a reliable consensus in economics. Macroeconomics is only one area of economics. In my view, it is the area with the highest ratio of unresolved issues to settled questions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yglesias <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2009/02/the_trouble_with_economics.php#comment-1098636">proposes a thought experiment</a></p>
<blockquote><p>I think that if the President got an ideologically diverse group of economists together and said “I’m going to impose a $800 billion stimulus package through some mystical process that doesn’t involve the need for congressional approval; I want to maximize short-term GDP boost per dollar spent and minimize long-term harm due to budget deficits, what should I do?” that you’d find some important areas of common ground. Not universal, immediate consensus. But I think important common ground and ideas that would be importantly different from what you’d get by pulling an ideologically diverse group of members of the U.S. House of Representatives together</p></blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>Sad to say, I think that Yglesias and Kling are wrong.  Consider your thought experiment and Kling himself.  His proposed stimulus would be a payroll tax holidy.  N. Gregory Mankiw is more famous and he agrees.  It is just not true that conditional on the size of the stimulus, economists agree on spending vs tax cuts.</p>
<p>More generally economists strongly disagree about the minimum wage (now that&#8217;s micro) the proper progressivity of taxes and, well, all about regulation.  </p>
<p>As far as I can tell, there is a near consensus in favor of free trade, because the people who are sure that protection is bad for the protecting countries ally with the people who care more about the third world than the USA.  I don&#8217;t actually know an economist who supports rent control.  Economists used to agree that the minimum wage was a bad way to try to support the income of the working poor (EITC much better) then some data misbehaved.</p>
<p>Aside from that, I can&#8217;t think of much agreement, that is many issues where the range of views of economists isn&#8217;t at least as wide as the range of views of the general public.  Examples of surprising disagreement after the jump.</p>
<p>update: pulled back from comments <br />Jeff H. says:<br />Today, 4:12:13 AM<br />“Some actual data might be helpful: <br />http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/consensus-of-economists.html</p>
<p>update II: from e-mail.  Ken Houghton sent me a power point presentation of a newer survey of AEA members with a much larger sample size.  I don&#8217;t know if the *.ppt is public domain or confidential, but I have to report one result.</p>
<p>66% of the economists surveyed said they planned to vote for Obama.  By Mankiw&#8217;s definition of &#8220;consensus&#8221; there was a consensus among economists that Obama would make a better president than McCain.</p>
<p>I comment after the jump.</p>
<p>The micro debate includes the extremely eminent and empirically grounded Alan Krueger and David Card who estimate that, if anything, the minimum wage causes increased employment and many economists who say they must have done something like fudging the data (no specific accusations, I don&#8217;t remember names and I wouldn&#8217;t type them if I did as casually tossing around such innuendos is unprofessional to say the least).</p>
<p>Economists disagree on whether civil rights legislation caused a reduction in the Black White earnings differential.  The very eminent Finis Welch left an AEA panel without listening to a paper by the to be Nobel Laureate James Heckman purporting to prove that it did (I think he had to catch a plane but you know he made the reservation).</p>
<p>Economists disagree about whether or not mandatory seat belt laws cause more traffic deaths.  The idea that they do does not come from some wingnut welfare think tank, it comes from the University of Chicago where full professor Sam Peltzman makes the argument.</p>
<p>I think that Kling guesses that all econmists views on micro are close to libertarian for the same reason that he asserted that <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2009/01/whats_with_the.html">all right of center economists opposed the stimulus.  <br /></a><br />He&#8217;s at Cato and his view of the economics profession is based on the economists he knows. They aren&#8217;t typical.  </p>
<p>Update:  I think I am wrong on the origin of Kling&#8217;s beliefs.  Via Jeff H in comments via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/11/consensus-of-economists.html">Mankiw</a>, I find that Kling told mankiw about <a href="http://www.bepress.com/ev/vol3/iss9/art1/">this survey.</a></p>
<p>Reading the results, I find an area of consensus which I had forgotten &#8212; economists overwhelmingly oppose agricultural subsidies.  </p>
<p>The evidence in the survey is strikingly weak.  The main problem is that the sample size (which varies by question) is at most 83.  That&#8217;s a small sample. The original survey was of 210 members of the AEA.  That&#8217;s a low response rate.  Like the author of the article based on the survey, Robert Whaples, Mankiw and Kling count 67% saying yes as a consensus.  This is not what I mean by the word consensus.  He didn&#8217;t ask say &#8220;Monetary policy is generally a better way to stabilize output than fiscal policy&#8221; (I&#8217;d guess more than 67% would have said yes including Krugman who has done so very explicitly) or &#8220;The FED should attempt to stabilize both output and prices&#8221; vs &#8220;the FED should ignore prices and try to stabilize output&#8221; or &#8220;the FED should just try to stabilize prices (as in the charter of the European Central Bank)&#8221; I&#8217;d guess that stabilize both would probably get 67%.  </p>
<p>I am going to cut and paste Mankiw&#8217;s summary of Whaples&#8217; results (note he selected areas of relative consensus and mentioned just one area of disagreement &#8212; the minimum wage).</p>
<p>    * 87.5 percent agree that &#8220;the U.S. should eliminate remaining tariffs and other barriers to trade.&#8221;<br />    * 85.2 percent agree that &#8220;the U.S. should eliminate agricultural subsidies.&#8221;<br />    * 85.3 percent agree that &#8220;the gap between Social Security funds and expenditures will become unsustainably large within the next fifty years if current policies remain unchanged.&#8221;<br />    * 77.2 percent agree that &#8220;the best way to deal with Social Security&#8217;s long-term funding gap is to increase the normal retirement age.&#8221;<br />    * 67.1 percent agree that &#8220;parents should be given educational vouchers which can be used at government-run or privately-run schools.&#8221;<br />    * 65.0 percent agree that &#8220;the U.S. should increase energy taxes.&#8221;</p>
<p>And, finally, the topic that generates the most consensus:</p>
<p>    * 90.1 percent disagree with the position that &#8220;the U.S. should restrict employers from outsourcing work to foreign countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>I find myself in the minority on several issues where Whaples detects a consensus (using such a broad definition).  Most economists support vouchers (although I wouldn&#8217;t call 67.1% a consensus).  My interpretation of the data is that vouchers don&#8217;t work.  In particular, I wonder if the economists have considered the problem of private schools set up in response to the profit opportunity created by vouchers.  Do they really trust such schools ?  Would they support vouchers if the alternative were charter schools ?</p>
<p>The 85% who are confident that there is a social security funding gap seems odd given the perfect performance of the trustees low cost estimate and the fact that it implies that there is no shortfall.   Here the views of economists seem similar to those of the general public (and to the consensus of pundits).  I wonder if economists who have actually looked at the data are so convinced.    I&#8217;d say the definite statement (no &#8220;probably&#8221; or &#8220;might&#8221; so to agree one should be 100% certain of the prediction) is inconsistent with available analysis of actual data.</p>
<p>Mankiw notes that </p>
<p>* 77.2 percent agree that &#8220;the best way to deal with Social Security&#8217;s long-term funding gap is to increase the normal retirement age.&#8221;</p>
<p>he doesn&#8217;t note that 57.1% also agree that &#8220;the best way to deal with Social Security&#8217;s long-term funding gap is to decrease social security benefits.&#8221; </p>
<p>Either 32.3 % of the economists in the survey think that the two approaches are identically good or they don&#8217;t know what &#8220;best&#8221; means.  The only other alternative was increase payroll taxes.  The survey didn&#8217;t ask economists about raising the ceiling &#8212; the approach which has by far the most support among the general public.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d say the survey shows that there isn&#8217;t consensus on anything (I&#8217;d say consensus implies at least 83 out of 83 but really you need unanimity in a larger sample before you have consensus).  </p>
<p>Imagine what would happen if you asked biologists if the human genetic material is DNA ? or if genes are objects with a mass and a location ?  Or if they believe in evolution by natural selection (or stronger if they think that the current forms and diversity of living things is due to evolution by natural selection).  </p>
<p>update II: see update II before the jump.  Note that according to Mankiw there is a consensus in the economics profession that Obama not McCain should be President.  For what it&#8217;s worth (nothing given sample sizes) that is larger than the proportion who support Mankiw&#8217;s favorite idea &#8212; energy taxes.</p>
<p>Also I should have mentioned this in update I, but, you know, not all economists are Americans.  A consensus in the profession doesn&#8217;t mean a consensus in the AEA.  I&#8217;d say there would be very different answers on vouchers and US social security in Europe (you would have to tell them the retirement age and the benefit level,  Then prove that the maximum benefit level is really that low with an official document because they wouldn&#8217;t believe you.</p>
<p>You know, I bet if you asked the economists in Whaples sample what social security should pay  min max and average they would probably come up with numbers higher than current pensions.  Many would know exactly what current pension levels are, but I guess that the others would have biased up guesses.  That is, I suspect, that economists, like the general public, support cutting something to a level higher than its current level.</p>
<p>On the general public one clear result of polling is that most US citizens want to cut foreign aid.  When asked for numbers they said from 10% of the federal budget to 5%.  Foreign aid is currently about 1% of the federal budget so the respondents wanted to cut it to five times the current level.  </p>
<p>Of course, economists know more about the federal budget than the general public, but that leaves plenty of room for policy proposals based on ignorance of current policy.</p>
