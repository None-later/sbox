                                <p>By divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reading Kevin Phillips “Bad Money”.  I want to understand where this idea that money is made from money comes from.  On page 61 he writes:  <br />
<blockquote>In 1996 a much discussed article in Foreign Policy titled “Securities: The New World Wealth Machine” had set out the ultimate paper entrepreneurial opportunity: high-quality stocks and bonds could be issued against clusters and pools of existing loans and assets, an innovation that “requires that a state find ways to increase the market value of its stock of productive assets.”  By such a strategy,  “an economic policy that aims to achieve growth by wealth creation therefore does not attempt to increase the production of goods and services, except as a secondary objective.”  </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1148994">Professor Edmunds</a>, the author of the article put&#8217;s it more bluntly on the first page than the quotes Mr. Phillips used. Referring to “<a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1148994">Securitization</a>&#8211; the issuance of high-quality bonds and stocks&#8230;” <br />
<blockquote>Wealth was created when a portion of income was diverted from consumption into investment of buildings, machinery and technological change.  Societies accumulated wealth slowly over generations.  Now many societies and indeed the entire world have learned how to create wealth directly. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now I don&#8217;t know but, is that not the grand slam of free lunch economics you have ever read?  How could a learned person make such a statement? </p>
<p>In fact, googling for this posting I came across a thesis by a <a href="http://www.smallisbeautiful.org/pdfs/DemMoneypart1.pdf">young man, 23 years of age </a>written for his college work in 2001 in which <a href="http://www.smallisbeautiful.org/pdfs/DemMoneypart2.pdf">he states</a>:<br />
<blockquote>What Edmunds refers to as “Securitization,” is nothing more than the shuffling of money from one market to another. However, this approach does create something known as a financial bubble; an instance in which an increase in speculation within a financial market, inflates the market value of stocks and bonds beyond their underlying value. It also results in a number of unpleasant systemic consequences.<br />First, an inflated financial market tends to exacerbate the trend for money to concentrate in the hands of the rich.<br />A second consequence of an inflated financial market is that it tends to draw money away from the productive sector that actually engages in the creation of wealth.  This can put an economy in a very tenuous position, as was evidenced by Thailand in 1997.</p></blockquote>
<p> Not bad for a student from a <a href="http://www.simons-rock.edu/about">liberal</a> arts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon's_Rock_College">college</a> in 2001.  All I can ask is: What the hell happened to the economist and money minds advising the last 2 and now the current president?</p>
<p>Back to Mr. Phillips, page 63:<br />
<blockquote>Back in 1986, Minsky had written in Stabilizing an Unstable Economy that where as a banker&#8217;s orientation to cash flow was sober, “an emphasis by bankers on the collateral value and expected value of assets is conducive to the emergence of a fragile financial structure.”</p></blockquote>
<p>  I searched “Minsky” at AB.  He comes up as early as 2004.  Unfortunately, I could not find the actual post. I googled Professor Minsky and to my surprise found an <a href="http://www.levy.org/pubs/wp74.pdf">original document</a><br />
<blockquote>The Financial Instability Hypothesis<br />by<br />Hyman P. Minsky*<br />Working Paper No. 74<br />May 1992</p>
<p>The <strong>readily observed empirical</strong> aspect is that, from time to time, capitalist economies exhibit inflations and debt deflations which seem to have the potential to spin out of control.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess it wasn&#8217;t to observed for the mantra I believe prior to the current fiasco was that everything was smooth sailing, the oceans have been tamed by man.  <br />In this paper, I believe the following is the relevant aspect of his theory that we need to learn:</p>
<blockquote><p>The theoretical argument of the financial instability hypothesis starts from the characterization of the economy as a capitalist economy with expensive capital assets and a complex, sophisticated financial system.</p>
<p>This Keynes &#8220;veil of money&#8221; is different from the Quantity<br />Theory of money &#8220;veil of money.&#8221;  The Quantity Theory &#8220;veil of money&#8221; has the trading exchanges in commodity markets be of goods for money and money for goods: therefore, the exchanges are really of goods for goods. The Keynes veil implies that money is connected with financing through time.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is the following in Professor Minsky&#8217;s paper that I believe would lead someone to make the statements Professor Edmunds made: <br />
<blockquote>Thus, in a capitalist economy the past, the present, and the future are linked not only by capital assets and labor force characteristics but also by financial relations. <strong>The key financial relationships link the creation and the ownership of capital assets to the structure of financial relations and changes in this structure</strong>&#8230;In contrast to the orthodox Quantity Theory of money, the financial instability hypothesis takes banking seriously as a profit-seeking activity.<br />Banks seek profits by financing activity and bankers. Like all entrepreneurs in a capitalist economy, bankers are aware that innovation assures profits. Thus, bankers (using the term generically for all intermediaries in finance), whether they be brokers or dealers, are merchants of debt who strive to innovate in the assets they acquire and the liabilities they market. <strong>This innovative characteristic of banking and finance invalidates the fundamental presupposition of the orthodox Quantity Theory of money </strong>to the effect that there is an unchanging &#8220;money&#8221; item whose velocity of circulation is sufficiently close to being constant: hence, changes in this money&#8217;s supply have a linear proportional relation to a well defined price level.</p></blockquote>
<p>And thus is born the idea that you can make money from money.  That is if you ignor that Professor Minsky does not state that finance stands alone, or that &#8220;an economic policy that aims to achieve growth by wealth creation therefore does not attempt to increase the production of goods and services, except as a secondary objective&#8221;.  On the contrary, he says nothing about primacy.  He just notes that what is missing in the Quantity Theory is finance.  <br />
<blockquote>Thus, in a capitalist economy the past, the present, and the future are linked not only by capital assets and labor force characteristics but also by financial relations. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>President Obama offered <a target="_blank" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/assets/fy2010_new_era/Department_of_Eduction.pdf">a proposal</a> to restructure the student loan industry. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newamerica.net/blog/higher-ed-watch/2009/battle-ahead-10495">Higher Ed. Watch</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Obama sent shockwaves through the student loan industry last week when he called on Congress to dismantle the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newamerica.net/files/Reliable%20Student%20Loans%20and%20Larger%20Pell%20Grants.pdf">Federal Family Education Loan (FFEL) program</a> next year and use the savings to turn the Pell Grant program into a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newamerica.net/files/Reliable%20Pell%20Grants.pdf">true entitlement for low-income students</a> by financing it entirely through mandatory funding. The announcement sent the stock prices of the nation&#8217;s largest student loan providers into a nosedive.</p>
<p>But investors need not panic, just yet. The Obama administration is sure to have a major battle on its hands &#8212; and not just from the usual suspects. While the president&#8217;s plan is unlikely to receive many Republican votes (save that of Rep. Tom Petri of Wisconsin, who has been a long time supporter of Direct Lending), the administration&#8217;s real challenge is going to be keeping members of its own party in line.</p>
<p>As we have previously reported, the student loan industry has gone to great lengths over the last two years to woo key Democrats. Sallie Mae outlined <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newamerica.net/blog/files/Sallie%20Mae%20Strategy%20Document.pdf">this strategy</a> in an internal strategy document it produced shortly after the Democrats took control of Congress in 2006. That document, which was obtained by Rep. George Miller (D-CA) and published on this blog, laid out the student loan giant&#8217;s plans to target generous campaign contributions toward &#8220;Blue Dog and Financial Services Democrats,&#8221; as well as members of the Congressional Black and Hispanic Caucuses. A Higher Ed Watch investigation in July 2007 found that Sallie Mae had lived up to its pledge &#8212; donating, through its political action committee, more than $100,000 to members of these three groups in the first six months after the election.</p>
<p>The lender&#8217;s efforts paid off at least with some of the groups. For example, in February 2008, Sallie Mae and other student loan firms looked to the fiscally-conservative <a href="http://www.house.gov/melancon/BlueDogs/">Blue Dog Democrats</a> for help killing a measure in the House of Representatives that would have made it substantially easier for financially distressed borrowers to discharge their private student loan debt in bankruptcy. The loan companies were not disappointed. Altogether, 30 of the 47 Blue Dog members, many of whom were also on the House Financial Services Committee, joined Republicans in opposing the measure, ensuring its defeat. At the same time, more than a dozen Democratic members of the Financial Services Committee helped lead the charge for a massive government bailout of the student loan industry last spring&#8211; far beyond what was needed to ensure the widespread availability of federal student loans.</p></blockquote>
<p>This particular program is lucrative for Congressional local districts, state based government, and guarantors alike.</p>

<p>After writing a series on Traumatic Brain Injury and Post Trauma Syndrome Disorder for active duty troops and National Guard, I am sad to post this item, in that it appears that the popular perception of the most common injuries among troops is still misunderstood. I also find that if I say TBI as an acronym, many civilians have no idea of what I am talking about.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://armytimes.com/news/2009/03/military_tbi_awareness_030409army/">The Army Times</a> reports on TBI:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Army officials announced the beginning of Brain Injury Awareness Month, they offered up a figure that makes it hard to believe anyone in the military could be unaware of the problem:</p>
<p>Between 45,000 and 90,000 troops have been treated for traumatic brain injury symptoms ranging from headaches to vision problems to an inability to function beyond a coma state.</p>
<p>Brig. Gen. Loree Sutton, director of the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury, said between 10 percent and 20 percent of soldiers and Marines — about 180,000 people — have screened positive for TBI.</p>
<p>Yet military doctors still fight a culture in which some troops believe they can head right back into the fight after being exposed to a blast — even though high school football players know better than to play again for a few days — and commanders may decide to risk sending someone outside the wire after an injury because there aren’t enough people to make up a patrol team.</p>
<p>Experts at the U.S. Military Academy have said it’s important for someone who has suffered even mild TBI to avoid the risk of re-injuring the brain — especially the not-yet-fully-grown brain of someone younger than 24 — because a second injury can lead to permanent damage or even death.</p></blockquote>

<p>With the unemployment rate jumping to 8.1% and downward revisions of the previous months<br />employment numbers it is hard to find anything encouraging in the February employment report.</p>
<p>But there is one tentative good sign.  I watch both the payroll and households surveys because the household survey tends to lead the payroll report at turning points.  I believe this is because the household survey does a better job of reflecting what is happening in small business and small firms tend to react quicker to changes in the economic environment.  This month for the first time this cycle the two measures diverged with the year over year drop in the payroll measure dropping more than the household survey.  It is not a sign of a bottom, but it is a sign that the economy may be approaching a bottom.</p>

<p>On the other hand the index of aggregate hours worked fell 0.7% to 101.9 versus the fourth quarter average of 104.1. So on a quarter to quarter basis we are now looking at a drop in hours worked in the first quarter of around -8.8% as compared to a drop of -7.4% in the fourth quarter.  This implies that first quarter real GDP growth could be weaker than fourth quarter growth.</p>

However, my wage equations implies that this wage moderation is just starting.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SbE61_LUncI/AAAAAAAAAsE/0fc1kZs9DwI/s1600-h/Clipboard04.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SbE61_LUncI/AAAAAAAAAsE/0fc1kZs9DwI/s320/Clipboard04.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The combination of slowing wage growth and falling hours worked is generating a sharp slowing of average weekly wages.  In the first quarter falling oil prices caused even this weak gain in<br />nominal wages to generate solid gain in real earnings.  But if oil prices rebound, or other upward pressures on prices cause inflation to rise significantly it is hard to see how the January uptick in real retail sales and real consumer spending can be sustained.<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SbE6trE6V0I/AAAAAAAAAr8/_yXzpuzzEKM/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SbE6trE6V0I/AAAAAAAAAr8/_yXzpuzzEKM/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

<p>Going Galt &#8211; Present and Past</p>
<p>There seems to be some chatter among right wing blogs about &#8220;going Galt&#8221; &#8211; i.e., ceasing to do paying work, shuttering one&#8217;s business, etc. &#8211; given Obama&#8217;s plan to let Bush tax cuts on those with the highest levels of income expire.  (This new movement is covered beautifully by TBogg <a target="_blank" href="http://tbogg.firedoglake.com/2009/03/02/youre-in-the-high-rent-district/">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://tbogg.firedoglake.com/2009/03/04/youre-going-to-miss-me-when-im-gone-no-no-i-wont-why-are-you-still-here/">here</a>. Its really worth reading those two posts, especially the first one.)  </p>
<p>You&#8217;d think we just got through one of the periods of the fastest growth in this country.  You&#8217;d think the fastest growth rates this country has ever seen came under Reagan, and that the slowest came under folks like FDR.  Oh wait, those people do think that way, at least about Reagan and FDR.  I actually wrote what might be a response to that, a few months back.  I&#8217;d like to repeat <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/ranking-presidents-on-real-economic.html">that post</a> here:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>As we get closer to election time, the level of invective seems to be going up. What I find interesting is how the intersection between that invective, general ignorance, and outright charlatanism.. </p>
<p>For example, mention of FDR is cropping up a lot in some circles, and not in a good way. You&#8217;d think, the way some bring him up, that FDR was the devil incarnate.. But by the numbers, FDR did one heck of a job. The Bureau of Economic Analysis has compiled data on real GDP per capita since 1929 (thank you Simon Kuznets), and in that time, no president produced numbers remotely comparable to those put up by FDR. </p>
<p>FDR was president from March 4, 1933 until his death April 12, 1945. Given his death came before midyear, let&#8217;s look at the growth from 1932, the year before he took office, to 1944, his last full year in office. Real GDP per capita grew at a scorching, yes, scorching 8.05% a year while he was President. Now, perhaps you protest… it was the war. The war saved the economy. But the growth rate of real GDP per capita from 1932 to 1940 was a blistering 5.37% a year, or about 2.2 times faster than Ronald Reagan. Now maybe you say to yourself – well, anyone can growth quickly if he follows the collapse we witnessed from 1929 to 1932. </p>
<p>Which brings us to the President who produced the second fastest growth rate… LBJ. LBJ [ed &#8211; corrected a grammatical error left in the first time] served from November 22, 1963 until January 20, 1969. Most of 1963 passed before he took office, so let&#8217;s measure his growth rate from 1963 to 1968, his last full year in office. That gives us 3.98% &#8211; about 1.6 times Reagan&#8217;s growth rate. And LBJ did not inherit a Great Depression, like FDR. Instead, he followed the President who produced the third fastest growth – JFK, under whom real GDP per capita was 2.65%, or about ten percent faster than Reagan managed.</p>
<p>So before we go on, its worth noting… FDR and LBJ probably come in for more criticism from the right for their economic policies than any other presidents precisely because of the one thing they had in common: these two, by far, expanded government more than other presidents, and not in ways specifically designed to further enrich folks who were already rich. They gave us the New Deal and the War on Poverty, Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid, the WPA and the Job Corps. One inherited a Great Depression, one inherited a great economy, one raised taxes, the other cut marginal tax rates, but both expanded the size and scope of government a lot, and both, simply put, produced. </p>
<p>Third, as noted, was JFK. Anyone think the New Frontier was the work of a small government guy? That perhaps the Space Program was really one of them laissez faire operations? (And please don&#8217;t attribute the 1964 tax cuts to Kennedy. LBJ invoked JFK&#8217;s name to get them passed, but they came after Kennedy died.) </p>
<p>The fourth fastest growth rates came courtesy of Bill Clinton: a 2.49% annualized increase in real GDP per capita, or about 2% more growth in real GDP per capita per year than Reagan.</p>
<p>Fifth was Reagan, sixth…. Ah heck, let&#8217;s just number them in order to save time:</p>
<p>1. FDR<br />2. LBJ<br />3. JFK<br />4. Clinton<br />5. Reagan<br />6. Carter<br />7.. Nixon<br />8. Ike<br />10. GW (that&#8217;s 10 so far – don&#8217;t be surprised if he sinks further into the mire)<br />11. Ford<br />12. Bush Sr.<br />13. Truman<br />14. Hoover</p>
<p>What the list shows us, is that, the top half of the spots are dominated by Democrats. Two Republicans, Reagan and Nixon, make it in (5th and 7th, respectively). It also shows us that the bottom half of the list is populated almost exclusively with Republicans. The one Democrat in the bottom half of the list, not incidentally, is the Democrat most beloved of Republicans today: Harry Truman. George Bush has compared himself to Truman, and a few weeks, Sarah Palin told us how she too was comparable to Truman. What are the odds that prominent Republicans would compare themselves with FDR or LBJ? (Snarky answer – probably about the same as the odds a Republican administration would produce a growth rate comparable to FDR or LBJ.) </p>
<p>Now, after 70 years of data, after observing what we&#8217;ve observed over all sorts of conditions, it is hard to conclude anything but this: one party advocates policies that produce rapid economic growth, and one part dismisses those policies with epithets like &#8220;socialism&#8221; and advocates instead policies that produce dismal economic growth. And dismal economic growth has consequences. Poor economic growth makes people worse off, and hits them in their pocketbook. And when people are hurting financially, their health suffers, the rate of divorce goes up, suicides increase, and the abortion rate increases. So those who advocate the policies that bring us lower incomes, poorer health, break up families, increase suicides, and increase the rate of abortions are doing us all a lot of harm. More, in fact, than Osama or Saddam could possibly have done. And yet, the folks who advocates those policies question the patriotism of the rest of us. Its very, very strange.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Real GDP per capita data can be obtained from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Going back through the rankings, its not difficult to spot the moments when today&#8217;s right would have &#8220;gone Galt.&#8221;  If think economic growth is generally a good thing, which leads me to conclude that the movement should be encouraged.. <br />_____________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have a very positive view of innovative financial products, or rather, of financial products invented in the past 20 years or so.  However, I love mortgage bonds (MBSs).  I think they are an excellent way of diversifying and eliminating risk.</p>
<p>However, I have to admit that they create a problem.  Since the mortgage initiator is not bearing all of the risk, the mortgage initiator and the debtor can profit at the expense of the investors who bought the MBSs.  To reduce this problem (which can&#8217;t be eliminated) mortgage initiators sign contracts which require them to do everything they can to get every penny owed by the debtor.  </p>
<p>This makes it difficult to restructure mortgage contracts even in cases where a restructured contract is better than foreclosure for the debtor, the innitiator and the investors.  I wonder if there is another way to handle the moral hazard problem which doesn&#8217;t involve such unfortunate rigidity ?</p>
<p>I had a thought which is probably stupid.  It seems to me that there might be something good about non-bank mortgage initiators.  What if they promise that they will have no revenues except a multiple of money that they send on to MBS investors (and agree to open their books so the promise can be enforced) ?  Oh and that the owners and employees will have no compensation from any source but that revenue scheme (this is as hard to enforce as laws banning public officials from taking bribes, that is not quite impossible).</p>
<p>That seems to reduce the moral hazard problem doesn&#8217;t it ?  Currently they get fees and points and stuff, that is cream of cash immediately before packaging the risky flow and selling it.  </p>
<p>Compared to issuing debt and initiating mortgages, this is still a sane business plan.</p>
<p>A no revenues but x% of what we send to you gives strictly positive revenues to the firm.  Now obviously employees will want a salary, so the shareholders of the mortgae initiator will have to bear quite a lot of risk.  </p>
<p>It seems to me that purchasers of MBS would be protected much more thoroughly than they are now and that firms with such a rule have a viable business plan.</p>
<p>What am I missing ?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_03/017167.php">Hilzoy</a> finds <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&#038;sid=aayr7s9dpgpw&#038;refer=exclusive">a fascinating story</a> about the Pareto improving wonders of renegotiation of mortgage contracts.  </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Patricia Greenberg&#8217;s townhouse in Irvine, California, was losing about $10,000 a month in value when she received a letter in February 2008 that looked too good to be true: An investor was offering to cut her $472,000 mortgage by 26 percent and her monthly payment by a third.</p>
<p>    &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want to get involved in a scam,&#8221; says Greenberg, a cosmetics saleswoman for Orlane Inc., who had bought the house with no money down eight months earlier.</p>
<p>    It was no ruse. New York hedge fund manager Ralph DellaCamera Jr. says he&#8217;d purchased the mortgage for 60 cents on the dollar and forced the originator, MLSG Home Loans of Reno, Nevada, to eat the loss. Protecting his investment, DellaCamera lowered Greenberg&#8217;s debt to keep her in the home. She now pays $2,400 a month instead of $3,800 and plows some of her savings into upgrading the Cape Cod-style residence.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>She asks why it doesn&#8217;t happen more often.  I comment</p>
<p>So why doesn&#8217;t this happen more often ? </p>
<p>I think the problem is that most mortgages don&#8217;t have one owner anymore.  The firm which lent Greenberg the money hadn&#8217;t packaged the money she sent them into a mortgage bond (MBS) and sold it &#8230; yet.</p>
<p>Many homeowners in trouble don&#8217;t owe more than they can pay to a bank or mortgage company.  They owe more than they can pay to investors who don&#8217;t even know who they are.  </p>
<p>To renegotiate such loans DellaCamera would have to buy up all the mortgage bonds. The owners of the MBS aren&#8217;t organized to bargain with him.  The person who owned the last bond with a claim on income from Greenberg would be able to block the whole deal unless DellaCamera paid him, her or it whatever he she or it demanded.</p>
<p>MBS by diversifying risk have created a collective action problem.</p>
<p>My solution is to set up the Big Bad Asset Bank BBAB (aka shitibank) and requisition all the MBS in the world in exchange for shares of the BBAB.  At this point all mortgages would be in, at most, 2 pieces, the part the initiator kept and the BBAB.  DellaCamera and other people as smart as he would make out like bandits and people would keep their homes.  The shares of BBAB would be worth more than the requisitioned MBSs).</p>
<p>The key is the word &#8220;requisition&#8221; that is take not buy so BBAB gets all of the toxic sludge not just the worst it.</p>
<p>Not gonna happen, but I think it would work.</p>

<p>Below I ask why the argument that the stimulus must crowd out private spending because output can&#8217;t be higher than aggregate supply hasn&#8217;t been made (or made more often if I missed it).  So now I will try to make that argument.  One rule is that I must concede that there are unemployed workers and idle capacity and, in particular, that there are more unemployed workers and idle capacity than before.  Second, I must assume that we are in a liquidity trap.  I was working on an argument, but Nick Rowe, in comments, suggested that this is really simple.  After the jump I give my effort at an argument then reply to Nick Rowe&#8217;s comment.</p>
<p>OK how can there be increased involuntary unemployment and a liquidity trap yet fiscal stimulus has no effect on output.  I will start with models of involuntary unemployment.  Some such models are based on nominal rigidities.  We know that in these models the stimulus will cause increased output.  </p>
<p>How about efficiency wage models ? Well start with the best known such model the moral hazard model.  In the model workers are tempted to shirk (pretend to work, work carelessly or pilfer) and firms can&#8217;t monitor them perfectly.  This means that the cost of being caught shirking and fired must be positive.  This can only happen if workers wages are above their reservation wage.  In the work/shirk model unemployment is not only possible, it is necessary to make the workers work.<br />the no shirking incentive compatibility condition gives a relationship between the real wage, the average disutility of working an hour (hours per worker are constant in the oldest model) and the unemployment rate.  High unemployment makes it costly to lose a job.  A high real gain per year of having a job makes it costly to lose a job.  Consider the unemployment rate required for a given real wage.  It increases if there is a high rate of layoffs, job separations for reasons other than being caught shirking.</p>
<p>The financial crisis has increased the probability of layoffs.  This could, in theory, happen with a financial crisis even if aggregate demand isn&#8217;t a problem (which can be solved by a stimulus plan).  The reason is that banks can&#8217;t tide firms over periods of poor cash flow (due to idiosyncratic shocks not aggregate demand) because the banks are broke.  So there is a much higher risk that firms will go bankrupt or be forced to shut down production and liquidate inventories.  </p>
<p>In the model this means a higher unemployment rate is needed for given real wages.</p>
<p>In the oldest (Shapiro Stiglitz) model employment is a standard function of real wages.  So far reduced employment requires a higher real wage which isn&#8217;t noticeable in the data so far.  With the financial crisis added in, employment is lower for a given real wage as firms are trying to liquidate inventories and replace them with inventories of cash (to replace lines of credit etc at banks that might fail any second).   The result is an ambiguous impact on the real wage and reduced employment.</p>
<p>In the model this can happen even if, for example, investment is automatically and magically aggregate supply minus consumption minus government consumption minus net exports.  Thus it can happen even if there is no problem with aggregate demand.</p>
<p>Aggregate supply in the model depends on, among other things, the exogenous separation rate.  One can solve out for the real wage, the unemployment rate and GNP as a function of tastes, technology and, in the extended model, the balance sheets of banks.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the price level (no nominal rigidities).  This means that for all existing models of aggregate demand there will have to be 100% crowding out.  It has to happen somehow.  </p>
<p>So, I think, it can be done.  The model would require absurd parameters to fit the data, but it is a standard model.  It happens to be one of the very many models which are anathema to fresh water economists.</p>
<p>OK now Nick Rowe.  He pointed out below that modern DSGE models have imperfect competition in labor and product markets, so markets don&#8217;t clear.  I&#8217;d say it is still implied that firms won&#8217;t sell any more at given prices (increased demand will cause them to increase their price for given wages and other prices) and workers won&#8217;t work more (perhaps they&#8217;d each like to but are restrained by unions which uhm you know Nick represent 5% of private sector workers in the USA).  So the crazy market clearing claim that firms won&#8217;t sell more and workers won&#8217;t work more at current wages and prices still hold.  Firms would sell more at current prices *if* demand increased and there were price controls so they couldn&#8217;t hope to raise their prices.  So I&#8217;m not sure how plausible a DSGE model with imperfect competition but no nominal rigidities is.  I mean it has firms setting higher relative prices if they increase output and that sounds a lot like refusing to meet demand at the current price.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t see how you can fit the pattern of consumption (down) and hours worked (down) without a sharp decline in the real wage (not in the data) unless leisure is an inferior good (so people work more hours after winning the lottery).  With perfect competition, this is a statement about a simple first order condition.  With imperfect competition in labor markets and fixed markups of wages on the marginal disutility of labor ditto.  Why would that markup increase ?  Now this is a claim that  DSGE models with or without perfect competition sure don&#8217;t fit the data.  It is an old claim (I heard Greg Mankiw argue it in the 80s).  I haven&#8217;t heard a convincing counter argument.</p>
