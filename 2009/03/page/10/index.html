<p>In the industrial production report this  morning February manufacturing output was  reported to drop 0.8%.  On the surface this looks bearish.</p>
<p>But hours worked in manufacturing also fell 2.0% in February.</p>
<p>Consequently, manufacturing productivity rose 1.2% in February.  The smoothed three month growth rate of estimated productivity is  0.1% and the year over year change is 0.4%.</p>

<p>A big jump in productivity is a major  positive for a rebound in manufacturing profits and output.</p>
<p>Moreover, the 0.8% drop in manufacturing output while real retail sales obviously fell much less in February implies that manufacturing inventories were also sharply reduced in February.</p>
<p>Technical note — this measure of productivity is actually manufacturing output<br />divided by hours worked by production workers.  It is not exactly productivity<br />as measured by the BLS, but it is close enough.</p>

<p>Do health outcomes not only depend on an individual&#8217;s absolute level of income, but also on their relative income position within a society? We use infant mortality as a heath status indicator and find a significant and positive link between infant mortality and income inequality using cross-national data for 73 countries. Holding constant the income of each of the the poorest three quintiles of a country&#8217;s population, we find that an increase in the income of the upper 20% of the income distribution is associated with higher, not lower infant mortality. Our results imply that, e.g., a one percentage point decrease in the income share of the richest quintile would decrease infant mortality by roughly one percent. The association of higher income of the rich and higher infant mortality becomes statistically insignificant when we control for health care expenditure. Our results indicate that the correlation between infant mortality and income inequality is partly explained by the fact that income inequality is high in countries where public investment in health care is low.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://baselinescenario.com/2009/03/16/much-worse-than-you-think-international-economic-diplomacy/">Baseline Scenario</a> adds their thoughts to the trade policy debate:</p>
<blockquote><p>A fundamental principle that we all hold dear is: in industrialized countries, with relatively high income levels, the government can’t be completely out to lunch.  After all, we reason, there are democratic processes, watchdogs of various kinds, and we can safely delegate monitoring of government official actions to others (e.g., the media). </p>
<p>This principle is, of course, now appropriately called into question both for government officials directly and increasingly for the media’s scrutiny of what the government (and business) is doing.  As a result, the level of public attention to various domestic policies &#8211; bailouts and the like &#8211; is surely at or close to all-time highs; the current reaction time and seriousness in public discussions of various initiatives for banks must set some sort of record.</p>
<p>Yet there remains at least one completely murky and unaccountable area of government action: international economic diplomacy.</p></blockquote>

And  the overall shape of the graph didn&#8217;t vary much from 1997 to 2007 (other selected years can be seen at <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/01/alternative-shapes.html">Alternative Shapes</a>). While the date of Trust Fund Depletion (on the figure a TF ratio of 0) moved out some for Intermediate Cost (II) the result for Low Cost never really varied, instead it yielded a more or less flat Trust Fund ratio. For most purposes a flat Trust Fund ratio means that Social Security is &#8216;fixed&#8217; in that income including interest on the Trust Funds continues to meet projected cost. But you can get too much of a good thing, for example the interest on a Trust Fund with a ratio of 2000 at a nominal 5% rate would fully cover cost, which would operationally transform Social Security into a General Fund welfare plan. But this seemed to be just a pie in the sky idea, instead even the most optimistic projection showed Trust Funds ratios under Low Cost somewhere between 300 and 500 meaning that Interest would only be called upon to meet 15-25% of ongoing cost after 2029 or so. Nice steady state system.</p>
<p>The whole question seemed rather academic in that Low Cost was always seen as an optimistic economic model. If the best we could possibly accept was a steady state system why really even think about Low Cost, if it happened it happened.</p>
<p>But the narrative changed drastically with the 2008 Report, the story line got a lot more twisted, it is just that nobody noticed. The 2009 Report is due out in a couple of weeks and who knows exactly what story it tells, but for those interested you can take a look at the Future of the Shape per the 2008 Report below the fold.</p>
<p>2008 II.D6<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/R_PB6t4ggSI/AAAAAAAAAAM/JjA6Q-1kAOQ/s1600-h/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/R_PB6t4ggSI/AAAAAAAAAAM/JjA6Q-1kAOQ/s320/Snapshot+2008-04-02+10-08-52.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The first thing to note is that this version of Low Cost is not a good outcome, there is no good reason to have the Trust Fund long term at anything but flat. In fact I argued that we should actually target a TF ratio of 100 in <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/soc-sec-xxvi-social-security-low-cost.html">Low Cost and the 100/100 Target</a>. But rather than rehash that I want to examine another aspect.</p>
<p>In the Summary of the Annual Report the Trustees supply three numbers for  Intermediate Cost: cost of an immediate fix, cost of a fix in 2041, cost of a fix at the end of the 75 year window, and then two more: amount of benefit cut needed in 2041 and cost at the end of the window. In years past those first three numbers are implicitly the equivalent of Low Cost in that they projected the same outcome of fully funded system with a presumedly flat TF ratio. In 2008 it is different. Now instead of needing numbers right at the probability limit (which is what Low Cost is presented to be) instead economic outcomes in between Intermediate Cost and Low Cost could end up producing that steady state result.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take some pairs of numbers for ultimate years (ten years out) from Intermediate Cost and Low Cost:<br />Unemployment: 5.5%, 4.5%<br />Real Wage: 1.1%, 1.5%<br />Productivity: 1.7%, 2.0%<br />Real GDP:  2.2%, 2.9%</p>
<p>Which raises a series of questions. One, even if we conclude that Low Cost is on the whole too optimistic, what is the economic argument against outcomes that split the difference? For example 2006 was not considered to be a really great economic year but the respective numbers turned out to be: 4.6%, 1.8%, 1.0%, 2.9%, that is while productivity lagged the other numbers came in pretty much at Low Cost levels.  Granted 2008 numbers are going to look terrible and 2009&#8217;s worse but is there someone out there with a serious argument about why these number series can&#8217;t revert to 2006 levels on average?</p>
<p>Two, what if we embarked on an economic policy that targeted the 100/100 outcome? I posed a form of this question back in 2006 in <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/01/goldilocks-and-three-social-security.html">Goldilocks and the Three Social Security Bears</a> but would reformulate it into something like the Four Musketeers. First let the Trustees continue to present the three current alternatives based on what they claim is best possible analysis, i.e. High Cost, Intermediate Cost, and Low Cost. But supplement that with a fourth economic model that would explicitly target a 100/100 solution (100% of scheduled benefit with a 100 TF ratio). And then let us have a debate whether we can reach that through policy means.</p>
<p>Because frankly laissez-faire is pretty much yesterday, the people who claimed that everything could be explained by EMH and that we would just end up where we would have been proven dead wrong. Specific choices by policy makers and investors combined with some Animal Spirits put us in the place we are and only die-hards are clinging to the idea that any of this was just the result of the Invisible Hand operating in a market of fully-informed participants. (Ask Bernie M&#8217;s clients how informed they were in retrospect). The dominant view in current Administration thinking is that we should strive for specific economic outcomes through deliberate policy actions. Why not include Social Security solvency via economic growth as one of those outcomes?</p>
<p>Because if we just slice the differences we are looking at something like 5.0% unemployment, 1.3% real wage, 1.9% productivity and 2.6% real GDP in the out years  to mostly or entirely solve the current projected gap. Those are not mad, crazy numbers and we don&#8217;t just have to accept what the economy throws at us. I don&#8217;t think we are likely to even get back at any point to 1999 numbers that had us at 4.2% unemployment, 4.7% real wage, 2.4% productivity, and 4.4% real GDP and certainly not as an average. But it seems kind of un-American to insist that the future can never even approach the past. These are just not unrealistic policy targets, why NOT shoot for them.</p>

                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>Last March, Richard Syron, former chairman of Freddie Mac, asserted that his primary obligation was to shareholders. We know what happened to Freddie Mac. Today we learn that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/business/15AIG.html?hp" target="_blank">AIG</a>, despite its difficulties and because of contractual arrangements, is planning on awarding huge bonuses to the very staff that led to its implosion. Firing, apparently, is not an option: The staff that created this chaos remains too valuable.</p>
<p>Another piece if the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/business/15school.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a> lays bare the essence of the problem: &#8220;Is It Time to Retrain B-Schools?&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of being viewed as long-term economic stewards, he said, managers came to be seen as mainly as the agents of the owners — the shareholders — and responsible for maximizing shareholder wealth. </p>
<p>“A kind of market fundamentalism took hold in business education,” Professor Khurana said. “The new logic of shareholder primacy absolved management of any responsibility for anything other than financial results.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And, of course, managers and their hirelings were all too busy lining their own pockets as well.</p>
<p>Shareholders may now have suffered, but the underlying private greed has not relented. Civic responsibility has fled. We have instead the premise that if each man legally pursues his own self-interest, regardless of how extreme that path may be, then all will benefit. Thus we celebrate the likes of Buffet and Gates&#8211;and teach our children that great wealth is a sign of God&#8217;s favor. We eagerly follow the ups and downs of the stock market. Do we &#8220;short&#8221; today or do we go &#8220;long&#8221;? Perhaps we can make a killing in currency exchange. How apt is the word <i>killing</i>. Take a close look at the language of the market: It is a &#8220;jungle&#8221; out there. Eat or be eaten. But even lions and jackals rarely take more than they can eat.</p>
<p>Economic Darwinism has stripped away everything but teeth and gullet.</p>
<p>We take our companies abroad to maximize shareholder profit. We carefully study the art of economics so that we can maximize profit even as we minimize social responsibility. What becomes difficult to think about becomes merely an exogenous variable, something for others to consider, not for those with an eye on personal profit and shareholder value. If we become wealthy enough, then we can share a small part of our largesse with those upon whose backs we trod.</p>
<p>How do we unravel such twisted logic? We know the logic by many phrases. &#8220;Trickle down&#8221; is one. Trickle down has become a torrential flow upward. &#8220;Privatization&#8221; is yet another such phrase, for in that simple word lies justification for the elevation of the individual at the expense of the many. &#8220;Free markets&#8221; is yet another, as if in unregulated freedom lies the prosperity of the nation, when in fact it is merely sleight of hand for private greed and profit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Government is inept&#8221; is yet another. Little do we realize that government is what ties us one to another. If we honored and valued it, then it would bring us value. If government service were something more than merely an entree to wealth and power, then we might actually be of service to those around us. And there is nothing wrong with honorable service, or with kindness, or true caring for our fellow workers and fellow citizens.</p>
<p>Instead, we have the revolving lobby door. &#8220;You were a former Mississippi senator? Retire early and catch the lobby gravy train.&#8221; You were a former President? Your connections are invaluable. Foreign interests will pay well for your influence and advice.&#8221; If lobbying is the name of the game, perhaps we should cancel our pension arrangements with former Presidents and senators, indeed with all public servants. Those pensions really are quite lucrative.</p>
<p>But enough is never enough, unfortunately. And we wonder why government has a bad name.</p>
<p>These people do no feel any shame in what they do. They are right at home among their kind. The step into the lobby crowd is considered a step up. Thieves honor one another; he who stole the most has the greatest cache. Of course we never think of a CEO as having any sense of public service. The greater his take the greater our admiration.</p>
<p>I think fondly of Harry Truman; he simply went home. He served.</p>

<p>playing faux naif again (except it&#8217;s not faux).  </p>
<p>What is the point of bundling securities into a special purpose entity and issuing debt tranches with various levels of seniority and issuing (or keeping) an equity tranche which doesn&#8217;t promise a fixed payment ?  This was a very profitable operation until recently.  How could that be ?</p>
<p>I wonder after the jump.  I conclude that the point of tranching was to weaken the effects of rules and regulations which could have been weakened directly &#8212; that it did not serve a socially useful purpose which couldn&#8217;t have been achieved directly.</p>
<p>First try explanation 1 &#8212; it generates assets suited to investors with different risk tolerance. Extremely risk averse investors will rationally buy the senior tranches.  More risk tolerant investors will buy the mezzanine tranches.  The investors with the highest risk bearing capacity will buy the equity tranches.  </p>
<p>Explanation 1 does not make any sense.  Consider a standard simplest model of financial markets.  Agents consume, save and invest aiming to maximize the present discounted value of a CRRA function of consumption (c^(1-sigma))/(1-sigma).  All assets are traded.  There are no transactions costs.  Absolute risk tolerance is proportional to the wealth of the investor.  The result is that each investor divides his wealth in equal proportions among different investments.  Market clearling implies that each investor owns an equal share of the senior, mezzanine and equity tranches of each CDO.  There is no point in tranching.</p>
<p>OK so add more diversity and make consumer i maximize the expected present discounted value of (c^(1-sigma_i))/(1-sigma_i).  Now the proportions of all *risky* assets held by each investor have to be the same.  Highly risk averse investors will put more of their money in TIPS.  Aside from that no difference.  This is a well known result in simple math (a first order condition).  There is still no gain from tranching.</p>
<p>So what is the point of tranching ?  Well in the real world, demand for different kinds of assets is not based on expected return and the contribution to total risk born by the investors.  In the real world the letters assigned by ratings agencies have real effects.  For example, banks have to satisfy minimum capital requirements which depend on total holdings rated AAA, C and in between.  The rules of private entities might be even more important than public regulations.  If you are managing an endowment set up by a crazy rich person whose will dictated that the money can be invested only in AAA debt, then you care about the ratings of specific assets not the portfolio level risk.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the only explanation of pooling and tranching was to get around rules and regulations.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve written this at angrybear before.  No commenter has told me another explanation of the profitability of pooling and tranching.  Now I am pleading (challenging) can anyone think of another explanation ?</p>

                                <p>I promise to try posting more this weekend, but this one is just too good to pass up.</p>
<p>Since most people don&#8217;t know it beyond three to six digits, today, 14 March (14.03)—er, oops, March 14 (3.14)—has been officially designated &#8220;Pi Day.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ten Republicans <a target="_blank" href="http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll124.xml">voted against the (purely symbolic) designation</a>:
<ol>
<li>Chaffetz</li>
<li>Flake</li>
<li>Heller</li>
<li>Johnson (IL)</li>
<li>Miller (FL)</li>
<li>Neugebauer</li>
<li>Paul</li>
<li>Pence</li>
<li>Poe (TX)</li>
<li>Shuster</li>
</ol>
<p>In fairness, I note that 30 Representatives (24 Dems, 6 Reps, and the total only comes to 431 so a few bodies appear to be vanished) did not vote, but 10 went to the explicit effort to signal their opposition to the motion, including Mike Pence, who is from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.snopes.com/religion/pi.asp">the only state that ever did make a concerted effort to define Pi as 3</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In 1897 the Indiana House of Representatives unanimously passed a measure redefining the area of a circle and the value of pi&#8230;.The bill died in the state Senate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Happy Pi Day!</p>

<blockquote>Gordon Brown last night hailed the ­beginning of the end for tax havens, as Switzerland opened up its ­legendary system of bank secrecy and agreed to hand over information on wealthy clients suspected of tax evasion.In a remarkable week, Europe&#8217;s secrecy jurisdictions – Liechtenstein, Andorra, Austria, Luxembourg, Jersey and ­Switzerland – all entered into international information sharing agreements.<br />Swiss ministers said the government caved in after learning the country was going to be included this month on a ­blacklist of uncooperative tax havens drawn up by the Organisation for ­Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Having agreed to sign up to the OECD protocol on tax, Switzerland will hand over information on account ­holders suspected of tax evasion by another country.<br />Until now tax evasion was not illegal in Switzerland and secrecy has been the bedrock of its economy.<br />Hans-Rudolf Merz, Swiss president and finance minister, said yesterday: &#8220;Co-operation on taxes has become more important given the globalisation of ­financial markets and in particular against the background of the financial crisis.&#8221;<br />Switzerland is the world&#8217;s biggest tax haven. The world&#8217;s rich hide at least $1.89 tn (£1.35tn) of the estimated $7trn of ­private wealth there according to the Swiss Bankers Association, though others put the figure much higher.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>So you have been reading about the southern GOP&#8217;ers that are refusing parts of the stimulus money.  Something about being true to their crede.  Well, we here in RIland have a GOP governor who is doing one better.  He want the money! The problem is in how he plans to use it to stimulate our economy.  </p>
<p>Are you ready?  Here it is: Tax Cuts!   Is this not kind of like living with grand parents who refuse to acknowledge that the times have changed?  Hey Grandpa, have you heard the news?  Trickle down never fixed those shoes. </p>
<p>Our governor Carcieri is proposing the following for RIland&#8217;s share of the stimulus money: <em>Reduce the corporate income tax from 9% to 7.5 in 2010 with a continued reduction to 0% (zero percent) by 2014.  (Mass is lowering theirs to 8.75 next year, we are currently second to Mass.)  Savings next year for business: $14.5 million  The Chamber says this will help start up companies.  I didn&#8217;t know start ups paid corporate income taxes.  Based on the states own data, 3500 companies of 50,000 pay the current 9%.</em></p>
<p>Next tax cut: Lower the annual business tax from $500 to $450.  My two businesses pay this tax.  I&#8217;ll get a $50 break, but the big guy&#8217;s will get to share millions.</p>
<p>Next tax cut: Raise the estate tax to $1 million from $675,000 which was set in 2001.  It would match the Mass threshold.  Estate tax filers would save $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Next tax cut: Reduce the income tax from 5 levels of 9.9% to 3.75% to 3 levels of 5.5 to 3.5%.  We already lowered the top once so that more rich would come live in RIland &#8217;cause you know, they&#8217;re the only ones that make an economy.  Well, the rich population has not increased.  </p>
<p>RI has already had this discussion and guess what?  The <a href="http://www.ctj.org/html/ritest.htm">rich make out every time</a>.<br />
<blockquote>The best-off Rhode Islanders pay 9.9 percent of their income in Rhode Island state and local taxes, while middle income families pay around 11 percent and low-income families pay over 14 percent.<br />Furthermore, the well-off have recently received significant reductions in Rhode Island taxes. The state has chosen to phase-down the percentage of federal personal income tax used to calculate Rhode Island tax&#8211;from 27 percent to 25 percent.  When the rate reduction and the pass-through of the federal cuts are combined, Rhode Island&#8217;s well-off have already received a large tax cut. When the rate cut is fully phased-in, the average cut will be $5,200 for the highest-income one-percent, but average only $97 for everybody else.  </p></blockquote>
<p>And the State loses every time:<br />
<blockquote>State income taxes are deductible on the federal tax return. Thus, when a state cuts its personal income tax, the amount deducted on the federal tax return is reduced. With the lower deduction, the federal tax goes up.  For example, for most taxpayers paying at the top federal marginal rate, every dollar in reduced deductions due to cuts in the state income tax will cause federal tax liability to go up by about 40 cents. Thus, the net cut for the taxpayer is 60 cents even though the state loses a full dollar in revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p> Here is some more on <a href="http://www.povertyinstitute.org/matriarch/documents/taxfacts_PICcomposite.pdf">RI&#8217;s taxes</a>.</p>
<p>He does want to treat capital gains as ordinary income.  Currently our rate is 1.67% “&#8230;or .83% in some circumstances.”  There has to be a catch here somewhere.</p>
<p>Back in 1999 when we were having the discussion <a href="http://www.ctj.org/html/ritest.htm">the alternative was</a>:<br />
<blockquote>For a tax cut of this size, there are some attractive alternatives. $42 million could hire 1,000 teachers. 1,000 teachers could reduce the average class size for 50,000 students from 25 to 17. It is a perfectly fair question to ask which is more important: giving an average tax cut of $7,900 to the richest people in the state, or improving these children&#8217;s education?(2)</p>
<p>Education is not the only option. 1,000 police officers could be hired instead, infrastructure improved, drug rehabilitation programs initiated or job training programs funded. Or a tax cut could be targeted to lower income taxpayers.</p></blockquote>
<p> Kind of sounds like what the president and congress had in mind when they just passed this stimulus plan. </p>
<p>He&#8217;s going to end a variety of deductions: mortgage, property taxes and charitable contributions.  Being that <a href="http://www.ctj.org/html/ritest.htm">property taxes range </a>from 5.9% (bottom 20%) to 4.7% (96 to 99%) but only 2.8% for the top 1%, I guess it&#8217;s bend over time for the majority.</p>
<p>In the end:<br />
<blockquote>An estimated 110,179 filers will each pay an average of $1261 more in income taxes according to Carcieri&#8217;s tax study commission.  The vast majority of them are individuals and couples making less than $75,000 annually&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t end there.  Oh no.  He want to use the stimulus to pay the $10 million settlement in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Station_nightclub_fire">Station nightclub fire</a>. Well, at least the money would get in the hands of those who could use it and would put it to work (as in spend it, as in stimulate the economy).</p>
<p>Lastly he&#8217;s going to use the stimulus to close our deficits.  $192.3 million for 2009and $239.2 million for 2010.  What we do after that, I have no clue.  But then again, we&#8217;re the state that used the tobacco settlement money to close our past deficits.  It is why we are in the mess we are in now.  I guess we&#8217;ll just hope another uncle dies and leaves us a fortune again when year 3 rolls around.  </p>
<p>And finally, to help reduce the spending, he&#8217;s going to reduce the revenue sharing to the towns and abolish the Pharmaceutical Assistance to the Elderly program.  Hope those 1%&#8217;ers say thank you to those elderly who will take the bullet for them.  </p>
<p>So, what&#8217;s your governor proposing? </p>
