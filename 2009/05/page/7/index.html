<p>The End of a Recession&#8230; And Where We&#8217;re Going</p>
<p>There seems to be some misunderstanding among most people about what constitutes the &#8220;end of a recession.&#8221;  The end, or the trough, does not signify all is well, or even that everything is improving.  The best description for the end of a recession comes from the NBER, the official arbiter of recessions (and their ends).  I&#8217;d like to quote from the report they put out about the end of the last recession, since I think our &#8220;recovery&#8221; is going to look a lot like that one.  Note that the call was made in July of 2003, and the recession ended in November of 2001.</p>
<p>So <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/july2003.html">here&#8217;s what the NBER said when they made the call</a>.  Note that I&#8217;ve taken the liberty of emphasizing a few points:</p>
<blockquote><p>CAMBRIDGE July 17 &#8212; The Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of Economic Research met yesterday. At its meeting, the committee determined that a trough in business activity occurred in the U.S. economy in November 2001. The trough marks the end of the recession that began in March 2001 and the beginning of an expansion. The recession lasted 8 months, which is slightly less than average for recessions since World War II.</p>
<p>In determining that a trough occurred in November 2001, the committee did not conclude that economic conditions since that month have been favorable or that the economy has returned to operating at normal capacity. Rather, the committee determined only that the recession ended and a recovery began in that month. A recession is a period of falling economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales. The trough marks the end of the declining phase and the start of the rising phase of the business cycle. <strong>Economic activity is typically below normal in the early stages of an expansion, and it sometimes remains so well into the expansion.</strong></p>
<p>The committee waited to make the determination of the trough date until it was confident that any future downturn in the economy would be considered a new recession and not a continuation of the recession that began in March 2001. The committee noted that the most recent data indicate that the broadest measure of economic activity-gross domestic product in constant dollars-has risen 4.0 percent from its low in the third quarter of 2001, and is 3.3 percent above its pre-recession peak in the fourth quarter of 2000. Two other indicators of economic activity that play an important role in the committee&#8217;s decisions-personal income excluding transfer payments and the volume of sales of the manufacturing and wholesale-retail sectors, both in real terms-have also surpassed their pre-recession peaks. <strong>Two other indicators the committee focuses on-payroll employment and industrial production-remain well below their pre-recession peaks. Indeed, the most recent data indicate that employment has not begun to recover at all.</strong> The committee determined, however, that the fact that the broadest, most comprehensive measure of economic activity is well above its pre-recession levels implied that any subsequent downturn in the economy would be a separate recession.</p>
<p>Identifying the date of the trough involved weighing the evidence provided by the behavior of various indicators of economic activity. The estimates of real GDP issued by the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the U.S. Department of Commerce are only available quarterly. Further, macroeconomic indicators are subject to substantial revisions and measurement error. For these reasons, the committee refers to a variety of monthly indicators to choose the exact months of peaks and troughs. It places particular emphasis on real personal income excluding transfers and on employment, since both measures reflect activity across the entire economy. The committee places less emphasis on the industrial production and real sales series, which mainly cover the manufacturing and goods-producing sectors of the economy. The committee also looks at estimates of monthly real GDP prepared by Macroeconomic Advisers. There is no fixed rule about what weights are assigned to the various indicators, or about what other measures contribute information to the process.</p>
<p>The behavior of these series strongly suggests that the trough occurred in late 2001. All the major indicators of economic activity were generally flat or declining through September 2001. Real GDP then grew at a substantial rate from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2001 and has continued growing since then. The committee concluded that this strong growth in the most comprehensive measure of economic activity essentially ruled out the possibility that the trough occurred later than the fourth quarter. The committee also viewed the behavior of quarterly real GDP as strong evidence against the possibility that the trough occurred in December 2001, since there could be a December trough only if economic activity was declining over most of the fourth quarter. Reinforcing the conclusion that the trough did not occur in December, two of the monthly indicators-personal income excluding transfers and the estimates of monthly real GDP-grew very rapidly in December, and the sales series grew as well. These considerations indicate that the trough occurred in September, October, or November.</p>
<p>Monthly real GDP and sales reached their lows in September. The committee&#8217;s conclusion that the trough did not occur in September was based on two considerations. First, personal income, employment, and industrial production were all substantially lower in October and November than in September. Second, the NBER&#8217;s practice has been to identify the highs and lows of economic activity that are due to the operation of normal economic forces; temporary movements in activity resulting from unusual forces, such as strikes, have been discounted in identifying turning points. The committee concluded that some of the depressed level of economic activity in September 2001 was the result of the exceptional events of September 11, and thus should not be considered in identifying the trough.</p>
<p>From October to November, industrial production and sales fell sharply, employment fell moderately, personal income rose very slightly, and monthly real GDP rose moderately. Based on this information, the committee concluded that the economy reached a trough in November.</p>
<p>The NBER&#8217;s practice has been that if economic activity is roughly flat at the end of a recession or expansion, the turning point is placed at the end of the flat period. Although the committee concluded that it was not necessary to invoke this rule to determine that the trough occurred in November rather than September or October, the rule strengthened the committee&#8217;s confidence in its determination.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that the <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EMRATIO?cid=12">employment to population ratio</a> never got back even to the end of the recession level until several years later, hence enabling GW to put out three major tax laws with some variation of the word &#8220;job&#8221; or &#8220;employment&#8221; in their titles.  (Apparently there is a school of governance somewhere whose motto must be &#8220;if at first you don&#8217;t succeed, why not really screw things up?&#8221;)  </p>
<p>This time, it may be worse.  Whether we&#8217;re near or at the bottom when it comes to GDP, I don&#8217;t know.  I think we are.  But just like last time, I believe the job losses will go on for a long time after the GDP stabilizes and begins to rise again.  Simply put, the US doesn&#8217;t manufacture enough, and too much of our employment prior to the start of the recession was tied up in irrelevancies and even harmful areas, such as financial fraud, bullshit, and, well, more financial fraud.  That led directly and indirectly to several years worth of distortions in the economy, such as the overproduction of homes, vehicles and durable goods, not to mention excessive demand for raw materials.   The structure of the economy needs changing, and the change is going to be paid for in pain.  </p>
<p>Sadly, its too late to avoid the pain.  Not that our leaders aren&#8217;t trying, mind you.   The Fed and the Federal Government seem determined to reflate the fraudulent portions of the economy, and reviving a few of the marks for good measure.   It provides a short term <strike>fix</strike> placebo but only harms us in the long run.  </p>
<p>But the fact that its too late to avoid the pain doesn&#8217;t mean its too late to do anything.  We can (but aren&#8217;t) taking steps to avoid the next parade of grifters and crooks fleecing their way through town.  And here&#8217;s how its done &#8211; hold the current batch of crooks, evildoers, and enablers accountable.  Its fairly easy to do &#8211; prosecute those who broke laws, and let the market take care of the rest of them.  That&#8217;s right, let them go under.   Let them get sued too.  Its not revenge.  Its a message to those who would otherwise follow in their paths. <br />___________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb &#038; Coberly</p>
<p>(Update: links to Google versions of spreadsheets added. .xls versions available by request)<br />The Northwest Plan is put forth here as a replacement for the plan of Nothing <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2006/05/cost-of-inactivity-nothing-as-plan-for.html">The Cost of Inactivity: &#8216;Nothing&#8217; as a Plan for Social Security</a>. Not that there is anything wrong with Nothing, we did nothing between 1997 and 2008 and the size of the problem facing Social Security shrank from 2.23% of payroll to 1.7%, and the date of Trust Fund Depletion moved out from 2029 to 2041. There must be a word for a problem that left unaddressed got smaller and more distant in time, but that word is not &#8216;crisis&#8217;. So while Nothing&#8217; has its merits it just is not as satisfying as Something, especially when the Henny Penny&#8217;s of this world are running around insisting the sky is falling. So the Northwest Plan is our Something.</p>
<p>It is often claimed that we just can&#8217;t tax or grow our way our of the so-called &#8216;Entitlements Crisis&#8217; which is true if you believe there is some sort of SocialSecurityMedicareMedicaid program out there. But there isn&#8217;t any such program and there is no good reason to insist that these programs be considered together. If we isolate Social Security we can see that there are very good possibilities the economy will grow fast enough to continue shrinking the payroll gap just as it did over the last dozen years. And if it doesn&#8217;t the cost of closing the gap via tweaks in payroll can be managed in a way that it would not be noticed. Hence the Northwest Plan.</p>
<p>The Plan comes in two flavors, the Tenth Now plan and the Trigger plan. There has been a certain amount of debate over the last few years that the Trustees&#8217; Intermediate Cost alternative&#8217;s economic projections were too negative and that we can afford to take his year by year using the numerically proven plan of Nothing. The Tenth Now plan essentially abandons that argument and just accepts Intermediate Cost at face value as a basis for planning policy. Per the 2008 Report the cost of a straight out fix via a payroll tax increase would be 1.7%, presumedly split as now with 0.85% paid by the employer and 0.85% by the employee. This is not a lot of money when you break it down to the individual worker, on the other hand the actual dollars won&#8217;t be needed for a few decades, there is no reason we cannot phase this in gradually.</p>
<p>Under Tenth Now FICA rates would be boosted by 0.1% every year from 2010 to 2029 then held steady until 2053 where if needed a new series of increases would be triggered. We say if needed because there are very good chances that we may never need to pull that trigger, and pretty good chances that we can halt the original set of increases prior to 2029 as actual numbers come in. The advantage of Tenth Now is that it arithmetically fixes Social Security and so removes it from the policy debate and with it takes $13.6 trillion in &#8216;unfunded liability&#8217; off the balance sheets thus removing a weapon from the hands of those who want to use projections over the God help us &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217; to scare us into gutting Social Security.</p>
<p>But the truth is that we could maintain a program of Nothing. Under current law Social Security is considered to be in Short Term Actuarial Balance if its Trust Fund Ratio is projected to remain above 100 (one year of reserves) in each of the next ten years. If we examine the projections of Intermediate Cost in the following table we can see that the combined Trust Funds will maintain TF ratios above 100 until around 2037 meaning that they would fail the Short Term test in 2028. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#316289">Table IV.B3.—Estimated Trust Fund Ratios, Calendar Years 2008-85[In percent]</a>. The Trigger Plan uses that test failure as the event to trigger a new set of increases starting in 2028 that arithmetically keep the combined TF ratio above 100 throughout the standard 75 year window.</p>
<p>On a pure policy basis the Trigger Plan is a better choice because it builds in flexibility. If the economy performs worse than projected the trigger point moves up, if the economy performs better than projected the trigger point moves out but in either case the phased in nature of the changes means no sudden economic discontinuities. Politically Tenth Now might be preferable because it demonstrates how small the cost of a fix really is when it comes right down to the individual weekly paycheck.</p>
<p>Update: Google spreadsheets: <a target="_blank" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=ru4Qp28bP72l2gsRvR_-yGQ">NW Plan-Trigger</a>&#8212;- <a target="_blank" href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=rUd69spjuuumNuYeAYFA1dQ">NW Plan-Tenth Now</a> <br />Excel or Appleworks versions are available on request by e-mailing Bruce at Bruce dot Webb2 at verizon dot net.</p>
<p>Both Tenth Now and Trigger treat Social Security as an undifferentiated whole. In truth OAS (Old/Age Survivors) and DI (Disability) are separate programs with separate trust funds. As it turns out DI already has failed the Short Term Actuarial Balance test. This suggest that the right solution is to apply a modified Tenth Now to DI that would have payroll increasing 0.05% (a Twentieth) each year for five years starting in 2010 which then would be followed up by a modified Trigger of about 0.07% for OAS in 2028. This works on a back of the envelope calculation but has not been turned into an actual spreadsheet.</p>
<p>The real reason for releasing the Northwest Plan this week (because versions of it have been discussed here at AB for months) is that with the release of the 2009 Social Security Report Tuesday afternoon we fully expect a full court press to push the Conrad-Gregg/Cooper Wolf SAFE bi-partisan commission legislation which is designed to force a plan based on benefit cuts through Congress on an up or down basis with little scope for debate or modification. It is important that people know that there are alternatives, including one that requires no changes at all until 2028. The only urgency here is among those who don&#8217;t want you to know how easily we can maintain Social Security as is.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://healthcarethinktank.blogspot.com/2009/05/great-tax-debate.html"><strong>The Great Tax Debate</strong></a></p>
<p>Employer-paid health insurance is usually a non-taxable benefit to the employee. IRC S106.</p>
<p>Over the years this “loophole” has popped up in various discussions of tax fairness and expanding health care coverage.</p>
<p>The Obama administration has floated various trial balloons, and Senator Baucus (D. Montana), an influential player in the health care reform debate, thinks the time for change may have come.</p>
<p>Rep. Charles Rangel (D. New York) a veteran representative and powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee says simply, “no way.” All tax legislation originates in Ways and Means.</p>
<p>Candidate Obama criticized John McCain for proposing the taxation of health insurance benefits, but advisors to President Obama will not close the door, including new DHHS secretary Sebelius.</p>
<p>President Obama needs a major funding source to help close the deficit and to provide a $600M plus health care reserve fund.</p>
<p>Some labor unions fiercely defend the tax break, as middle class union members would be hit hard by a tax on health insurance benefits.</p>
<p>(Using real tax family returns and creating pro formas by adding policy amounts, the tax increase could range from about $1500 &#8211; $5000, depending on the structure of the tax, the possible applicability of FICA and Medicare taxes, and the taxation policies of state and local governments.)</p>
<p>In theory, employers would save some money because enhanced government programs would slow or eliminate “cost shifting” from the uninsured to the insured. However, employers might end up paying higher matching FICA taxes. Employees would be unlikely to see any of the savings (if any).</p>
<p>This could be a nasty debate, with some strange bedfellows.<br />__________________________________<br />by Rusty</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb; plan details and numbers by Coberly and Arne</p>
<p>The Northwest Plan takes as a starting point by answering the question raised in <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/05/time-for-clarity-income-vs-cost-six.html">A Time for Clarity</a> by coming down clearly on the side of the beneficiary. Which among other things means accepting that the current Trust Fund is an asset and not a liability. This doesn&#8217;t mean we can ignore the burden it places on future taxpayers, we just insist it be placed in numeric context. Exactly how much burden does redemption really place on future taxpayers? By year? And &#8216;$13.6 trillion over the Infinite Future Horizon&#8217; is not in fact an answer to those questions.</p>
<p>The Northwest Plan starts by examining the six possible approaches and initially rejects the two that are directly harmful to future beneficiaries which is to say 1) raise retirement age &#038; 2) adjust benefit formulae. There are projections that would force us to those positions but we see no reason to start with the proposition &#8220;Mom is projected to living longer than her Gramma did so lets just hitch her to the plow until she is 70&#8221;. Because for most workers retirement is the goal and not something you are &#8220;forced to&#8221; endure. Healthy time with the grandkids, time to travel, time not being under the thumb of your boss is what we are shooting for.</p>
<p>This is not to say that the Northwest Plan slavishly insists on delivering exactly 100% of the scheduled benefit, just that we get as close to it as we can without undue burden on workers or diverting assets away from other social goods. Of the three of us Arne and I am most mindful of Rosser&#8217;s Equation, which takes into account the fact that since initial benefits rise with real wage that future retirees will be able to buy a bigger basket of goods than current ones do. In fact if we did nothing to Social Security and the economy came in line with Intermediate Cost projections the reset in benefits in 2041 still leaves future retirees with a better benefit than currently situated retirees gets today. While a 22% cut seems drastic and is something the Northwest Plan is designed to avoid we do note that with Prof. Rosser that 78% of 160% = 125%. (I want my great-niece to have a better life-style in retirement than her great-grandmother (my Mom) does today. On the other hand my Mom is doing just fine, that N. would only get a 25% better deal would not be not a tragedy. Still I want to deliver 60% if I can.)</p>
<p>So if benefit cuts are what we are trying to avoid, which of the other four approaches do we favor? Well I don&#8217;t think any of us reject out of hand diversifying Social Security away from bonds to other asset categories, if that is if that didn&#8217;t put benefits unduly at risk and promised a better result. None of the Plans I am aware of take that approach, each has a component that cuts guaranteed benefits, and too many take a Dow 36,000 approach to potential risk of equities. Nor do we favor approaching this via raising the cap outright, though I for one would be open to adjusting the formula that increases it annually. But that is not part of the current Northwest Plan. What is is below the fold.</p>
<p>If we reject initially approaches 1-4 we are left with 5 &#038; 6: raise payroll tax across the board, or  target policy in ways that will lead to increases in Real Wage. Given that the future is unknowable the Northwest Plan starts by assuming Intermediate Cost but builds in triggers to account for performance better than that. (If the economy performs substantially under Intermediate Cost we will have problems far bigger than Social Security to contend with). What is the real cost of a payroll based fix?</p>
<p>Well in large part it depends on when you start, the Trustees explain it as follows.<br />
<blockquote>Over the full 75-year projection period the actuarial deficit estimated for the combined trust funds is 1.70 percent of taxable payroll—0.26 percentage point smaller than the 1.95 percent deficit projected in last year’s report. This deficit indicates that financial adequacy of the program for the next 75 years could be restored if increases were made equivalent to immediately and per manently increasing the Social Security payroll tax from its current level of 12.4 percent (for employees and employers combined) to 14.10 percent. Alternatively, changes could be made equivalent to reducing all current and future benefits by about 11.5 percent. Other ways of reducing the deficit include making transfers from general revenues or adopting some combina tion of approaches.<br />If no action were taken until the combined trust funds become exhausted in 2041, then the effects of changes would be more concentrated on fewer years and fewer cohorts:<br />•<br />For example, payroll taxes could be raised to finance scheduled benefits fully in every year starting in 2041. In this case, the payroll tax would be increased to 15.94 percent at the point of trust fund exhaustion in 2041 and continue rising to 16.60 percent in 2082.<br />•<br />Similarly, benefits could be reduced to the level that is payable with scheduled tax rates in each year beginning in 2041. Under this scenario, benefits would be reduced 22 percent at the point of trust fund exhaus tion in 2041, with reductions reaching 25 percent in 2082.</p></blockquote>
<p>In summary we could raise payroll tax by 1.70% immediately, or we could wait until 2041 and raise it by 3.54% initially with increases of an additional 0.66% over the subsequent forty-two years.</p>
<p>This gives us a range of options for a tax-based fix, and none of them are ugly, in each case the net is a better real basket of goods. For example  take a worker making a wage of $12.50 per hour, fairly typical for a moderately skilled laborer or clerk, which over the course of a year gives a annual wage income of $26,000. If we asked that worker if he would accept an increase in payroll tax of $221 per year with another $221 coming from his employer in he knew that would deliver 100% of the scheduled benefit with no need to change retirement age would he take that? Is an extra three years of retirement worth $4.25 a week out of your current take home? (1.7%/2 = 0.85 x $26,000 = S221/52 = $4.25). Of course the numbers increase proportionately as you move up the income ladder but even for people earning at the cap we just are not talking that much money ($106,850 x 0.85% = $908/52 = $17.50 or double that for the self-employed).</p>
<p>This is doable, but the Northwest Plan seeks to make it even more doable with two alternative plans. One plan shows the actuarial result if you phase in this increase starting a 0.1% in 2010 and increasing it at that rate each year until 2030, then holding until 2053 where if need a trigger kicks in with gradual increases from there. This is what Coberly calls Tenth Now. The second plan would hold rates where they are until 2028 and start the increases then. This is what Coberly calls Trigger 2. The spreadsheets are fairly cryptic, you have to know how Social Security organizes its data to begin to understand them, and they are currently only partially available in Excel, instead originating in an AppleWorks format, but for those that want the early versions they are available at by emailing me at bruce.webb2 at verizon dot net. (clearly indicate subject, this is mostly my spam mail box). When we get them worked into more readible form we will get them up on the web.</p>
<p>Beyond the tax piece the Northwest Plan also addresses the question of growth. People often make the claim that &#8220;We can&#8217;t tax or grow out way out of this&#8221; but that is only true if you conflate so-called Entitlements into some hybrid SocialSecurityMedicarePartAMedicairdMedicarePartB&#038;D program. Instead all of these programs have their own challenges and their own solutions. If we examine Social Security in isolation there are not only tax based fixes but all growth based fixes. Arne I working some of this out, in the meanwhile you can see his work at <a target="_blank" href="http://adastra1960.blogspot.com/">Arne&#8217;s Blog</a></p>
<p>The Northwest Plan in combination can deliver a 100% benefit at a very reasonable price to the worker. At the very least in a democratic society ALL options should be on the table and not just the subset that most editorials offer us today. We don&#8217;t need to tie Mama to the plow, under the Tenth Now plan she and her employer just has to start paying 0.1% more per year, For the worker earning $12.50 per hour that works out to $26 in the first year, meaning just on an extra one hour of labor per year or a contribution of a buck a month. Depending on wage history it might mean working up to 20 hours more by 2030. Still not a bad tradeoff for three years of lost retirement (and even at that raising retirement age only closes about one-third of the gap.)</p>
<p>At a minimum it is worth calculating the impact of including a payroll tax base component in an overall Social Security Fix.</p>
<p>(Please feel free to check the math, we want to get this right)</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Over the next couple of days I&#8217;ll be rolling out what I am tentatively calling the Northwest Plan for Fixing Social Security, &#8216;Northwest&#8217; because the three current contributers happen to live in the Pacific Northwest. But before doing so I want to lay out some of the conceptual differences underlying various discussions of Social Security Crisis.</p>
<p>Everyone I think would agree that Crisis is marked by a gap between Income and Cost at various future points and intervals. But that is where agreement stops and conflict starts.</p>
<p>Social Security starts from the position that it is obligated by law to pay out benefits under the current schedule and it breaks down Income and Cost as seen in this table: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_SRest.html#253691">Table IV.A3.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, Calendar Years 2003-17  [Amounts in billions]</a> In their formulation it breaks down as follows:<br />Income = Net contributions (FICA payroll tax) + Tax on Benefits + Net Interest<br />Cost= Benefits + Administration + RRB Interchange<br />Income &#8211; Cost = Net increase during year which added to year beginning  Trust Fund Balance = Total TF Assets which as of Jan 1, 2008 was $2.2 trillion.</p>
<p>In this model Income-Cost = Surplus/Deficit and indeed it is this figure that is used in Unified Budget Surplus/Deficit.  But that is just the Trustees position.</p>
<p>Others including the people at AEI look at this from a totally different direction and insist that we should properly see this in terms of Cash Flow to and from the General Fund, Under their formulation it breaks down like this:<br />Cash Income=Net contributions +Tax on Benefits<br />Cash Outlays=Benefits + Administration + RRB Interchange<br />Liabilities=Existing Trust Fund Balance plus Net Interest.</p>
<p>What was for Social Security at the end of 2007 a  $2.2 trillion asset is for AEI a $2.2 trillion liability which needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. In fact from their perspective it is even worse than that. Because if you take this &#8216;funded liability&#8217; and add it to &#8216;&#8221;unfunded obligation for past and current participant&#8221; of $15.2 trillion you end up with a &#8220;Present value of future cost less future taxes for current participants&#8221; of $17.4 trillion. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267012">Table IV.B7.—Present Values of OASDI Cost Less Tax Revenue and Unfunded Obligations for Program Participants[Present values as of January 1, 2008; dollar amounts in trillions]</a></p>
<p>Neither model is illegitimate in itself, it is just that the first takes the view point of the beneficiary while the second takes the viewpoint of the future taxpayer. What is the future retirees&#8217; asset, the year end Trust Fund balance, is the current taxpayers&#8217; liability. Which is where the problems start. Because the two populations only partially overlap in space and time. Some current taxpayers will receive only a small fraction of their income in retirement under Social Security. On the other hand they pay most of the income tax needed to redeem the Trust Fund. While certain future beneficiaries will rely on Social Security for most of their income in retirement and may not pay any income tax at all. And of course there is a whole range of people who fall in between.</p>
<p>Now under either model there are six possible approaches to closing the gap between income however defined and cost.<br />1. Raise the retirement age<br />2. Change the formulae for initial benefits and/or adjustment of future benefits<br />3. Raise the current payroll cap or change the formula which annually adjusts it<br />4. Exploit the long term premium of stocks over bonds by diversifying away from Special Treasuries<br />5. Raise payroll tax across the board<br />6. Target policy in ways that increase Real Wage going forward.<br />(Actually it is not as simple as this suggests, this implicitly holds the demographic assumptions steady. We could also target policy at the fertility, mortality and immigration numbers, but that only over-complicates an already complex question).</p>
<p>If as AEI does you consider the Trust Fund to be a liability whose future funding should be minimized or avoided in the interest of &#8216;sustainable solvency&#8217; then the obvious starting points are 1 &#038; 2. If you are a future retiree who will be mostly reliant on Social Security and doesn&#8217;t anticipate paying income tax in retirement 1 &#038; 2 would be your last resort. In fact since from this standpoint &#8216;crisis&#8217; is defined as a benefit cut in 2041 1 &#038; 2 might add up to a cure that is worse than the disease, and particularly if like me you don&#8217;t have any solid plans to be around after 2041.</p>
<p>So when evaluating any Social Security &#8216;Reform&#8217; plan it is important to see what they are fixing, are they looking out for the interest of the future beneficiary? Or just the future taxpayer? And which taxpayer? The worker making under the median or the taxpayer who earns their income from gains on capital? </p>
<p>Cui bono? Cui poena? Those are the questions we should be starting with.</p>

                                <p>By Spencer,</p>
<p>What is causing the rise in oil prices?</p>
<p>Part of it is that $30 oil in December was most likely too low, and as the world economy and oil demand bottomed,  oil prices should have also bottomed.</p>
<p>OK, that should explain oil in the $30 -$50 range.  I expected to see oil bounce between $30 and $50 in a cob-web function as oil settled in on a new equilibrium price.</p>
<p>That analysis worked for a while, but now Oil has broken out to the upside.  Why?</p>
<p>Maybe marginal demand is stronger than generally thought.</p>
<p>For years I have watched real oil imports as a measure of US marginal demand for oil and US demand for OPEC oil.  Early this year, after several years of stagnation real oil imports surged very strongly.  That was a real surprise.  With oil demand falling and oil stocks unusually high, why should oil imports surge?  It does not make sense to me.</p>
<p>Do others have a good explanation?</p>

<p>The 2009 Report of the Trustees of Social Security will be released late in the afternoon on Tuesday the 12th. Reports from all years are available starting from this page <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html">Reports from the Board of Trustees</a> or you can view the HTML, download the PDF, or order a paper copy of the new Report directly from this page <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/index.html">The 2009 OASDI Trustees Report</a> (link will not work until Report is actually released). There will also be a new post here and at BruceWeb.blogspot.com giving some breakdowns followed up by new numbers.</p>
<p>Why is this important? Didn&#8217;t all this get settled in 2005? Au contraire mon frere, instead the enemies of Social Security are gearing up for one last run at it. In this case they are mounting a campaign to form a &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; entitlements commission that would present an up or down plan to Congress. Which would be reasonable enough if there was proposed to be a free and open debate with all options on the table. That is not the plan, instead they want to stuff the commission with people pre-committed to a program of benefit cuts and retirement age increases, any idea of addressing this through phased in tax increases or simply taking a tack of &#8216;wait and see&#8217; (the &#8220;Nothing&#8221; Plan) not even being on the table.</p>
<p>The plan for a bi-partisan commission is being pushed hard from the outside by various entities connected to Peter G. Peterson (see the discussion in this William Grieder cover story for the Nation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thenation.com/doc/20090302/greider">Looting Social Security</a>) and is represented in Congress by two pieces of proposed legislation. The Senate version is called <a target="_blank" href="http://budget.senate.gov/democratic/statements/2007/bipartisantaskforcerelease091807.pdf">Conrad-Gregg</a> for short and was introduced by the Senators in a Sept 2007 Op-Ed <a target="_blank" href="http://thehill.com/op-eds/a-bipartisan-approach-to-americas-greatest-fiscal-challenge-2007-09-26.html">A bipartisan approach to America’s greatest fiscal challenge</a>. They describe the plan as follows:<br />
<blockquote>We believe the solution lies in a balanced, bipartisan approach. Therefore, we have come together to offer the Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action Act. This task force, made up equally of Democrats and Republicans, will be charged with authoring bipartisan legislation to immediately begin addressing the nation’s fiscal challenges. Everything will be on the table. This will not be another commission mulling over ideas that will be filed away, and it won’t be under the control of one political party or the other. It is designed to produce legislative solutions that Congress must vote on, not just bury in political debate.</p>
<p>Here’s how it will work: The bill establishes a 16-member task force that is comprised of four congressional members each chosen by the Senate majority leader and House Speaker; three congressional members each chosen by the Senate and House Minority Leaders; and two administration members, one chosen by the president and the other being the Secretary of the Treasury, who will serve as task force chairperson.</p></blockquote>
<p>Though unstated the recommendation of this Commission will be presented to Congress on an up or down basis on the model established by BRAC, the Base Realignment and Closing Commission. We can assume that all six Republicans will be committed to benefit cuts, and that by nature the two Democratic sponsors (Conrad from the Senate and Cooper from the House) will be seated then with Administration buy-in the &#8216;reformers&#8217; start with a ten vote majority and only need Reid and Pelosi to add in a combination of two &#8216;sensible&#8217; &#8216;moderates&#8217; to make this a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>The corresponding version on the House side is called the <a target="__blank" href="http://www.cooper.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=239&#038;Itemid=73">Cooper-Wolf SAFE COMMISSION LONG-TERM FISCAL REFORM BILL</a> described by Cooper as follows:<br />
<blockquote>The Securing America’s Future Economy (SAFE) Commission Act would create a 16-member panel comprised of the White House OMB Director and Treasury Secretary; four members appointed by the Senate Majority Leader and four appointed by the Speaker of the House; three appointed by the House Minority Leader and three appointed by the Senate Minority Leader. No more than four Members of Congress could sit on the commission. It would be tasked with holding town hall meetings around the country and then submitting a report that balances long-term spending and revenue scenarios for the nation. If Congressional leaders fail to introduce their own proposal, the SAFE Commission’s legislative proposal is automatically brought to the House floor. If passed, it is sent to the Senate for similarly expedited consideration.</p></blockquote>
<p> This plan is very similar to Conrad-Gregg except that it limits Congressional participation to four members of Congress who quite naturally would be named Conrad, Gregg, Cooper and Wolf. Meaning that if the Peterson folk can get two out of the six outside Democratic seats they are home free. And you bet there will be a push to get participation from some of these &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; groups. Because what could be more bi-partisan than a group effort by Brookings and AEI? Look at all the sensible moderates authoring the following: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.concordcoalition.org/files/uploaded_for_nodes/Taking_Back_Our_Fiscal_Future.pdf">Taking Back our Fiscal Future</a> We got Will Marshal! and Alice Rivlin! But look at how they describe the challenge and the solution.<br />
<blockquote>• Unsustainable deficits in the federal budget threaten the health and vigor of the American economy.  <br />• The first step toward establishing budget responsibility is to reform the budget decision process so that the major drivers of escalating deficits—Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid—are no longer on autopilot. </p></blockquote>
<p>Read through the entire document, there is not a hint that those deficits were also driven by out of control defense spending or tax cuts for the wealthy, as with every single Peterson backed call for fiscal responsibility the solution allways starts and stops with &#8216;entitlements&#8217;. And for those who say &#8216;Wait neither Brookings or AEI is a Peterson production&#8217;, not that this document is hosted at Concord which was founded and to all accounts still ultimately controlled by Peterson.</p>
<p>Some more links: AEI <a target="_blank" href="http://www.american.com/archive/2009/a-first-step-toward-fiscal-responsibility">A First Step Toward Fiscal Responsibility</a> Which step would be? Why a Bi-Partisan Commission! This one evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, meaning of course that Blue Dogs control the outcome. Or you could just explore the links at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bipartisancommission.com/Resources.html">The Bipartisan Commission: a bipartisan way to solve our nation&#8217;s  financial challenges</a> and what are those challenges?<br />
<blockquote>The following are some useful websites which provide additional information concerning the fiscal problems that the federal government faces concerning entitlement spending on Medicare and Social Security as well as possible solutions, including the establishment of a bipartisan commission to find solutions for these problems. </p></blockquote>
<p> And among those &#8216;useful websites&#8217;? Hmm, the Concord Coalition and the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.</p>
<p>They say even paranoids have real enemies, and if Social Security was personified it would be twitching madly ever time it looked over its shoulder and saw a representative of PGP. Which in this case includes Conrad, Gregg, Cooper and Wolf.</p>
<p>So it is not just a Report release, it is the opening shot in what will hopefully be the last Battle to Kill Social Security. They set the stage with &#8216;Vanishing Surplus&#8217;, you can bet they are going to try to ram the results of the Report right down our throats. And given that there are reliable reports that SSA is still stuffed with Bush embeds (up until a week ago there were no official Obama photos hanging in the SSA offices and some higher-ups are resisting that even now) a little vigilance is in order.</p>
