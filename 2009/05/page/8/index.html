<p>Sorry, I have been tied up with other things and have not done my usual charts on the employment report.</p>
<p>Others seem to be doing a pretty good job.</p>
<p>But I would like to point out the issue that seems to be overlooked by everyone.That is the point that we are now starting to really see the weakness in wages that I have been anticipating.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SgSNMw48PZI/AAAAAAAAAvk/kXCn9Z0W4lk/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SgSNMw48PZI/AAAAAAAAAvk/kXCn9Z0W4lk/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Average weekly earnings were only up 0.1%, and with oil prices rising sharply that means that it will be virtually impossible to get the rebound in real incomes continued growth in consumer spending probably needs. This implies we are almost completely dependent on government stimulus to get the economy growing..</p>

<p>The End of the Recession &#8211; A Follow-Up</p>
<p>In December, I wrote a post (which through a mixup went up in early January) about the end of the recession, stating <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/end-of-recession-prediction.html">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Specifically, I expect it before the second half of next year. I&#8217;m actually hedging my bets here &#8211; my gut tells me that it will come before the second quarter of next year.</p></blockquote>
<p>That was at a time when just about nobody was saying we&#8217;d be out until 2010.  (I note  I was also a bit early to call the start of the recession  &#8211; in March of 2008 I had a few posts talking about how the recession that had started was different from past recessions.)  </p>
<p>In comments to the end-of-the-recession post, I pointed out </p>
<blockquote><p>The end of the recession doesn&#8217;t mean things are all rosy.  It does mean the trough, though.</p></blockquote>
<p>After all, the last time around, we weren&#8217;t out of the woods job-wise until about two years after the recession ended.  </p>
<p>I stand by a few other things noted in the post as well &#8211; that the actions of the past administration and the current administration have made things worse.  This could and should have been a mild garden recession if the banks had been allowed to fail and then been cleaned up a la Resolution Trust Corporation.   (The Big 3 wouldhave still been in trouble, but the bulk of that problem would have occurred at a different time, reducing the severity of the whole mess.)  </p>
<p>Fast forward a bit, and over at Econbrowser, James Hamilton has had a few posts (the most recent one <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2009/05/this_shoot_is_d.html">here</a>) looking at the possibility that the trough is here based largely on the declines we&#8217;ve observed in initial jobless claims.   If that whole analysis is right, I was wrong about it happening in the first quarter, but not by much &#8211; April or May.</p>
<p>And if you pay attention to the commodities markets, especially oil and natural gas, it seems a lot of players are not just predicting a bottom right about now, but that we&#8217;re going to come zooming back.  Frankly, I think they&#8217;re overly optimistic by quite a bit.</p>
<p>Things could, of course, still get worse.  A lot worse.  This administration has proven it will do some of the same bone-headed things its predecessor did.  The Big 3 are throwing a bit of a monkey wrench into things.  And I don&#8217;t even want to think about the effect of the whole Brooke Shields &#8211; Kiefer Sutherland rift.  (Actually, I really don&#8217;t.  I don&#8217;t know why I even know about it.  Repeated attempts to scrub that information from my brain have failed.)  </p>
<p>So&#8230; where are we now?  Are we about at the bottom?  What is the trajectory the economy is going to follow through the end of the year?  Thoughts+<br />____________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p>These figures show graphically what the recession has done to Social Security&#8217;s medium term outlook. Answer? Not much.. A near term dip in income is never fully recovered in dollar terms.  A DI  &#8216;Primary Surplus&#8217; heading for zero got there a little faster. Does any of this add up to rushing to form a Bi-Partisan Commission? I don&#8217;t think so.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHLl4pXI9I/AAAAAAAAAMI/49qNEffAxMc/s1600-h/SSABPresentation.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHLl4pXI9I/AAAAAAAAAMI/49qNEffAxMc/s400/SSABPresentation.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORD48lAI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/MN7FBgysvbc/s1600-h/SSABPresentation2.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORD48lAI/AAAAAAAAAMQ/MN7FBgysvbc/s400/SSABPresentation2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORRWoxWI/AAAAAAAAAMY/CoqnEA51NNs/s1600-h/SSABPresentation3.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORRWoxWI/AAAAAAAAAMY/CoqnEA51NNs/s400/SSABPresentation3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORWsRlqI/AAAAAAAAAMg/ScEmCzdxCS4/s1600-h/SSABPresentation4.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SgHORWsRlqI/AAAAAAAAAMg/ScEmCzdxCS4/s400/SSABPresentation4.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/101xx/doc10100/SSABPresentation.pdf">CBO Presentation to SSAB</a> (note there is no associated text-this link included for reference)</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.texasobserver.org/article.php?aid=3031">Texas Observer</a> carries commentary that is revealing.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Editor’s note: These remarks were delivered to a meeting of the Texas Lyceum in Austin on April 3, at a debate between University of Texas professor James Galbraith, an Observer contributing writer, and former Majority Leader Richard Armey, chief instigator of the recent Astroturf “tea party&#8221; protests. Armey had begun his remarks by noting that his rule in life was “never trust anyone from Austin or Boston,” and proceeded to declare his allegiance to the “Austrian School” of economics, a libertarian view that regards public intervention in private markets as socialism. </p>
<p>It is of course a pleasure to be with you today. I was born in Boston, and I am proud of it. And I have lived 24 years in Austin—and I’m proud of that.</p>
<p>Leader Armey spoke to you of his admiration for Austrian economics. I can’t resist telling you that when the Vienna Economics Institute celebrated its centennial, many years ago, they invited, as their keynote speaker, my father [John Kenneth Galbraith]. The leading economists of the Austrian school—including von Hayek and von Haberler—returned for the occasion. And so my father took a moment to reflect on the economic triumphs of the Austrian Republic since the war, which, he said, “would not have been possible without the contribution of these men.” They nodded—briefly—until it dawned on them what he meant. They’d all left the country in the 1930s.</p>
<p>My own economics is American: genus Institutionalist; species: Galbraithian.</p>
<p>This is a panel on the crisis. Mr. Moderator, you ask what is the root cause? My reply is in three parts.  (below the fold)</p>
<p>First, an idea. The idea that capitalism, for all its considerable virtues, is inherently self-stabilizing, that government and private business are adversaries rather than partners; the idea that freedom without responsibility is a viable business principle; the idea that regulation, in financial matters especially, can be dispensed with. We tried it, and we see the result. </p>
<p>Second, a person. It would not be right to blame any single person for these events, but if I had to choose one to name it would be a Texan, our own distinguished former Senator Phil Gramm. I’d cite specifically the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act—the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act—in 1999, after which it took less than a decade to reproduce all the pathologies that Glass-Steagall had been enacted to deal with in 1933. I’d also cite the Commodity Futures Modernization Act, slipped into an 11,000-page appropriations bill in December 2000 as Congress was adjourning following Bush v. Gore. This measure deregulated energy futures trading, enabling Enron and legitimating credit-default swaps, and creating a massive vector for the transmission of financial risk throughout the global system. When the Washington Post caught up with me at an airport in Parkersburg, West Virginia, a year ago to ask for a comment on Gramm’s role, I said very quickly that he was “the sorcerer’s apprentice of financial instability and disaster.” They put that on the front page. I do have to give Gramm some credit: When the Post called him up and read that to him, he said, “I deny it.”</p>
<p>Third, a policy. This was the abandonment of state responsibility for financial regulation: the regulation of mortgage originations, of underwriting, and of securitization. This abandonment was not subtle: The first head of the Office of Thrift Supervision in the George W. Bush administration came to a press conference on one occasion with a stack of copies of the Federal Register and a chainsaw. A chainsaw. The message was clear. And it led to the explosion of liars’ loans, neutron loans (which destroy people but leave buildings intact), and toxic waste. That these were terms of art in finance tells you what you need to know.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>By divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>The following from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/05/how-big-should-financial-services.html">Robert&#8217;s post</a> got me thinking about railroads.  <br />
<blockquote> &#8220;There have been three big banking booms in modern U.S. history. The first began in the late nineteenth century, during the Second Industrial Revolution, when bankers like J. P. Morgan funded the creation of industrial giants like U.S. Steel and International Harvester. The second wave came in the twenties, as electrification transformed manufacturing, and the modern consumer economy took hold. The third wave accompanied the information-technology revolution.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> I talked about what was the same in the “second” wave then as today in my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/taxations-rhetoric-today-and-yesterdays.html">Taxation Rhetoric</a> posting.  As far as I&#8217;m concerned it had little to do with financing great industrialization and more with our first big flirt with financialization which is why we got the financial regulation in the 30&#8217;s.</p>
<p>As for the third wave, I believe there was the reporting of stupid money chasing anything with a dot com skirt on.  Before that, in the 80&#8217;s we had “greenmail”, a smaller housing bubble and Milken et al.  This got me thinking about the railroads and stories about how people would start building parallel lines just to get the big boys to buy them out.  Early versions of greenmail?  Stupid money chasing anything with a train.  This was the biggy of the “first” wave. </p>
<p>So I went looking in order to write up something real to respond to Robert&#8217;s post and found that today is just like yesterday except that yesterday we actually got something when the people&#8217;s money was being used to line a private pocket.  </p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Historical Handbook Number Forty</strong><br />1969</p>
<p><em>This publication is one of a series of handbooks describing the historical and archeological areas in the National Park System administered by the National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. It is printed by the Government Printing Office and may be purchased from the Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D.C., 20402, Price 60 cents</em></p>
<p>Both companies therefore resorted to a favorite device of 19th-century railroad builders—a construction company with interlocking directorate free of Government regulation&#8230;</p>
<p>The 1864 Act made the United States <strong>&#8220;virtually an endorser of the company&#8217;s bonds for the full amount of its own subsidy,&#8221; </strong>and now both the U.P. and the C.P. could draw on double the amount of subsidy granted for each mile of completed road.</p>
<p>The Union Pacific&#8217;s construction company was the Crédit Mobilier of America. In 1864 Durant bought the Pennsylvania Fiscal Agency, a corporation loosely chartered by the Pennsylvania Legislature to engage in practically any kind of business, and renamed it the Crédit Mobilier. The directors and principal stockholders of this company were virtually the same as those of the Union Pacific. <strong>Greatly simplified, the process worked like this: The Union Pacific awarded construction contracts to dummy individuals, who in turn assigned them to the Crédit Mobilier. The Union Pacific paid the Crédit Mobilier by check (i.e., cash, for the benefit of Congress), with which the Crédit Mobilier purchased from the Union Pacific, at par, U.P. stocks and bonds, which it then sold on the open market for what they would bring. The construction contracts were written to cover the Crédit Mobilier&#8217;s loss on the securities and to return generous profits.</strong> In this manner the directors and principal stockholders of the Union Pacific, in their opposite role as directors and stockholders of the Crédit Mobilier, reaped large profits as the rails advanced.</p>
<p>The Big Four used an almost identical device to build the Central Pacific. Although in practice continuing to share in the management of the Central Pacific, Crocker resigned from the directorate and formed the construction firm of Charles Crocker and Company, in which Stanford, Hopkins, and Huntington were the only stockholders. The connection between the two companies was too obvious, and in 1867 the Big Four organized the Contract and Finance Company, with Crocker as president. Acting for the Central Pacific, they awarded to this company the contract for building the road from the California line to the junction with the Union Pacific, as well as for supplying all materials, equipment, rolling stock, and buildings. The chief advantage of the Contract and Finance Company over the Crédit Mobilier, as railroad historian Robert E. Riegel pointed out, <strong>&#8220;was that it was able to get its accounts into such shape that no one has ever been quite able to disentangle them</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  It all sounds so deja vu.  But, unlike our $1 trillion and climbing paranoia driven military program we invested in today, these guys got us a real asset that paid dividends and they did it in 4 years instead of the 10 years planned for while lining their pockets.<br />
<blockquote>Such techniques not only pushed the railroad to completion in record time, but also made its financiers extremely wealthy men. The Union Pacific cost about $63.5 million to build, of which about half represented the Government s loan. The best estimate of profits gained is about $16.5 million, although the enormity of this figure emerges only when it is understood that at no one time did invested capital exceed $10 million. <strong>Profits thus amounted, not to 27-1/2 percent, but to more than 200 percent.</strong> The Central Pacific&#8217;s figures are more difficult to arrive at, mainly because many of its books were &#8220;accidentally&#8221; destroyed by fire during the Congressional investigation of the Crédit Mobilier, The best authority, however, places the cost of construction at $36 million. The company received land grants and Government bonds valued at $38.5 million, <strong>while Stanford admitted that $54 million in Central Pacific stock transferred to the Contract and Finance Company in payment of construction contracts represented virtually net profit</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Alas, there was a price to pay, a lesson that should have been learned.  It took 1929 to actually learn it.<br />
<blockquote>There was an inevitable reckoning. Both railroads were burdened with inflated capitalization that meant decades of high rates and operating losses. The Crédit Mobilier investigation in 1872, moreover, brought the railroads bad publicity <strong>that strained relations with the public and the Government for many years and <em>produced hostile legislation</em>.</strong> Nevertheless, almost all railroad historians, while deploring the financial buccaneering of the Pacific Railroad builders, <strong>agree that only through such methods could the railroad have been built without far more liberal Government aid</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did you catch that?  We either put up the money or we let the private sector do it at a higher cost?  Another lesson we seem to not want to learn (health care anyone?).<br />And, how did our governmental department view all this creative financing in 1969?<br />
<blockquote>Their methods were those of the 1860&#8217;s, employed by most of their contemporaries in business—practices condemned as thoroughly unethical by today&#8217;s standards. Thus the truly great achievement of hese men has been tarnished by the judgment of a later generation. They were, in fact, the first victims of the revulsion against such methods that swept the country during the early 1870&#8217;s. </p></blockquote>
<p>  It&#8217;s just heart breaking that they only got 200% on their money.</p>
<p>See, it&#8217;s always there.  <em>ALWAYS, THERE.</em>  And, just like 1969, we hear cries that the perpetrators are victims.  Just simple mistakes made.  Of course, that would imply some lessons were learned.  That we are repeating again today, yesterday, puts the lie to the entire argument of victum and mistake.  Yet, as I said, we got something for all this personal self interest with the peoples money in the past, unlike today&#8217;s privatization of the: military, health care, schools, roads, utilities, environment.  All failing, all in need of major capital investment.  All representing investment made, value lost.<br /><a href="http://catskillarchive.com/rrextra/strrbu.Html">Munsey&#8217;s Magazine</a> 1903 reprint:<br />
<blockquote>The money invested in the railways that we had in operation in 1880 was comparatively a few millions. Today the railway systems of the United States represent an investment of three billions and a yearly earning capacity of hundreds of millions.</p></blockquote>
<p>In <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/compare/">today&#8217;s money</a>, that 1903 railroad investment has a value of:</p>
<p>   $757,220,398,593.20  using the Consumer Price Index  <br />   $604,412,640,969.90  using the GDP deflator using value of consumer bundle  <br /> $3,333,116,883,116.90  using the unskilled wage  <br /> $4,369,728,261,008.50  using the nominal GDP per capita  <br />$16,503,666,443,504.30  using the relative share of GDP  </p>
<p>What a shame we let ourselves be talked into the “creative destruction” of the rail system, an asset that represents $3.3 trillion dollars in unskilled wages.  That&#8217;s a lot of labor just gone.  It represents a relative share of GDP bigger than our actual current GDP!  It makes you think about who has managed their wealth better; the US? or Europe who did not creatively destroy their original investment, but built upon it and thus saved themselves from having to generate as much income as we have had to in order to have our now killing us (war for oil?, pollution, resource waste, etc), personal transportation system.  I guess that is why we don&#8217;t get to have 6 weeks vacation for all, we have to work to rebuild what we had.

<p>James Surowiecki has <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/financial/2009/05/11/090511ta_talk_surowiecki">an interesting article </a>on this topic in the May 11 New Yorker.</p>
<p>He reaches rather precise conclusions including </p>
<p>&#8220;The desire to bring back the boring, small banking industry of the nineteen-fifties is understandable. Unfortunately, the only way to do that would be to bring back the economy of the fifties, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>and outsourced to Thomas Philippon, an economist at N.Y.U., <br />&#8221; a normal financial sector would be about the size it was in 1996.&#8221;</p>
<p>He reaches these conclusions by confusing causation with correlation, deducing something about the location of an unobserved variable from a correlation, assuming that 19th and 20th century financial markets must have been efficient and reaching a conclusion by not considering any alternative.  Altogether a methodologically interesting article. </p>
<p>The key phrase in the article is &#8220;accounted for&#8221; which is equated with caused by. <br />This is a dead give away.  I review the article and point out the areas which I find unconvincing after the jump.</p>
<p>Before going on I must stress that I am commenting on Surowiecki not Philippon.  I haven&#8217;t read Phillipon&#8217;s article.</p>
<p>The sentence in which the key phrase appears is &#8220;To be sure, deregulation was also a factor, but Thomas Philippon, an economist at N.Y.U., has shown that most of the increase in the size of the financial sector in this period can be accounted for by companies’ need for new capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>By the end of the next paragraph this becomes &#8220;Each wave, Philippon shows, was propelled by the need to fund new businesses, and each left finance significantly bigger than before. In all these cases, it wasn’t so much that the bankers had changed; the world had.&#8221;  So &#8220;accounted for&#8221; has become &#8220;propelled by&#8221; and correlation has become causation.  </p>
<p>Importantly, there is no claim that the volume of financial services was equal to the level required to fund new businesses.  The same pattern would be found in the data even if the level of financial services was a billion times that needed to fund new businesses.  So long as the ratio is constant it doesn&#8217;t matter what it is.  A claim about the location of a variable (the actual level is about equal to the socially necessary level) can&#8217;t be based on a correlation.</p>
<p>In particular, even if the causation is technological progress leads to an increased number of new firms and then to an increase in financial activity, there is no evidence that the increased financial activity was necessary or helpful.  An increase in the amount of prey causes an increase in the number of predators.  This does not mean that the predators are helpful to the prey.  If the financial services industry were purely parasitic, one would expect the same pattern.  </p>
<p>So far this is obvious and neither Surowiecki nor especially Philippon would be the least bit discomfited if they read the above criticisms.  I have just said that the evidence they present does not amount to proof.   </p>
<p>The last two methodological errors are, however, interesting.  They are also closely related.  My first claim is that the argument that variables must reflect the effect of the real economy on the financial sector is based on the efficient markets hypothesis  &#8212; that Surowiecki assumes what he seeks to prove.  My second claim is that the most popular alternative to the efficient markets hypothesis explains the patterns.</p>
<p>The evidence surveyed by Surowiecki is partly broadly historical.  &#8220;There have been three big banking booms in modern U.S. history. The first began in the late nineteenth century, during the Second Industrial Revolution, when bankers like J. P. Morgan funded the creation of industrial giants like U.S. Steel and International Harvester. The second wave came in the twenties, as electrification transformed manufacturing, and the modern consumer economy took hold. The third wave accompanied the information-technology revolution.&#8221;  This is a very crude correlation.  In particular, the 60s are left out, although they were a period of rapid economic growth.  The late 19th century is vague.  Surowiecki asserts that the 21st century is different as he considers the recent expansion of finance to be quite different from earlier ones.  </p>
<p>The more quantiative evidence in Surowiecki&#8217;s article is the following </p>
<blockquote><p>This meant that the economy became, and has remained, far more competitive, while corporate performance became far more volatile. In the nineteen-eighties, companies moved in and out of the Fortune 500 twice as fast as they had in the fifties and sixties. Suddenly, there were lots of new companies with big appetites for outside capital, which they needed in order to keep growing. And it was Wall Street that helped them get it. Companies like Turner Broadcasting, M.C.I., and McCaw Cellular used junk bonds to turn themselves into major businesses. Venture-capital investing took off, and so did the I.P.O. market; there were twice as many I.P.O.s between 1980 and 1999 as there were between 1960 and 1979. </p></blockquote>
<p>So the evidence is that there were more I.P.O.&#8217;s and more firme entered and exited the Fortune 500.  These are held to be real economy changes which cause changes in the financial sector.  This would be a valid assumption *if* financial markets were efficient.  However, the point of the exercise is to decide if the scale of financial sector changes because of changes in the level of irrational financial activity.  To see if the correlations are evidence against this hypothesis one has to look at the hypothesis.  How about looking at &#8220;Advances in Behavioral Finance&#8221; edited  by Richard Thaler 1993.  Oh my it has a chapter on IPOs.  </p>
<p>The chapter notes that an IPO can be a win/win when a firm grows to a size such that its founders don&#8217;t want to bear all the risk *or* an IPO can be a win lose when suckers are willing to pay unreasonably high prices for the firms shares.  If one considers the possibility that changes in financial activity are based on changes in the number or irrational optimism of irrational agents, then one notes that all indices of market sentiment are correlated with IPOs.  Importantly future predictable long term returns are low when the optimisms index is high.  IPO shares are a bad investment (I mean if you get them straight from the initial subscription they are OK but if you buy them second hand or later on the next day you get bad beta adjusted returns on average).  </p>
<p>The idea that asset prices and trading volume move up and down with the flow of new suckers to be fleeced is the alternative to Surowiecki&#8217;s hypothesis.  It fits the correlation with IPOs just as well.  </p>
<p>Consider the new technologies leading to new firms leading to more finance &#8220;Second, the corporate world was transformed by revolutionary developments in information technology and by the emergence of new industries like cable television, wireless, and biotechnology.&#8221;   OK I submit that the new industry called &#8220;television&#8221; was more revolutionary that the new industry called &#8220;cable television.&#8221;  I think this is safe to say.  So why did cable require more from the financial services industry ? I&#8217;d guess that cable used the financial services industry more, because there were more suckers to be fleeced.</p>
<p>Ohr how about &#8220;biotechnology&#8221;. I love biotechnology, but it remains minuscule compared to chemotechnology.  Can anyone really pretend that the ability to synthesize new and interesting compounds increased more in the 80s and 90s than in the 50s and 60s.  I mean anyone who is familiar with the state of organic chemistry in the 40s.  What is a bigger innovation erithropoetin or penicillin ?  </p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t that biotech started in universities and synthetic organic chemistry in large corporations.   The pathbreaking work in synthetic organic chemistry was based in universities (does the phrase Woodward-Hoffman rules ring a bell ?).  </p>
<p>Something else caused the chemists to let existing firms develop their technology while molecular biologists set up new firms.  I don&#8217;t think it was the science.  I think it was the huge number of suckers to be fleeced.</p>
<p>Here the evidence that changes in the financial services industry were caused by changes in non financial technology is entirely financial.  It is not based on total factor productivity growth or any assessment of inventiveness other than an IPO.  </p>
<p>Now I admit that the Fortune 500 evidence is less circular (I even admit that when I began typing this post I misremembered &#8220;Fortune 500&#8221; as &#8220;S&#038;P 500&#8221;  mega ooops).  However, at the very least, one has to look at the largest *non financial* corporations.  In 2009 the 500 included </p>
<p>11 Bank of America Corp. 113,106.0 4,008.0 <br />12 Citigroup 112,372.0 -27,684.0 <br />13 Berkshire Hathaway 107,786.0 4,994.0 </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure about old names but I don&#8217;t recognise any financial services corporations in the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune500_archive/full/1955/index.html">top 100 in 1955</a></p>
<p>The entry of financial corporations into the Fortune 500 (and no I won&#8217;t look at the while 500) can&#8217;t be evidence of a cause outside of finance of financial hypertrophy.</p>
<p>More generally, membership has a lot to do with the price of products.  Obviously the price of petroleum has a huge effect.  I notice Anaconda Copper in the top 100 in 1955.   How about the price of a kilometer of fibe optic cable ? How much of that real economy volatility is based on speculation ?  There is no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Oddly Surowiecki seems not only to make assumptions about the direction of causation, but seems to make contradictory assumptions about the direction of causation. The statement &#8220;The desire to bring back the boring, small banking industry of the nineteen-fifties is understandable. Unfortunately, the only way to do that would be to bring back the economy of the fifties, too.&#8221; asserts causation from the financial sector to the real sector.  The claim is that an intervention in fiance (much stricter regulation) will cause a change in the rest of the economy (it will become as boring as it was in the 50s).  However, the interpretation of the evidence is always that changes in non financial technology caused changes in finance.  So &#8220;are accounted for&#8221; becomes &#8220;propelled&#8221; which becomes &#8220;needed or else it would have been cut short.&#8221;    Altogether not convincing.  </p>
<p>I have a guess as to how this article came to be.  Surowiecki&#8217;s conclusions are fairly radical.  He advocates a major tightening of regulation and a huge reduction of the financial sector.  The arguments which I find unconvincing are arguments against much more radical proposals.  I think that the need to prove that he isn&#8217;t a <a href="http://www.google.it/search?hl=en&#038;as_q=dirty+fucking+hippy&#038;as_epq=&#038;as_oq=&#038;as_eq=&#038;num=10&#038;lr=lang_en&#038;as_filetype=&#038;ft=i&#038;as_sitesearch=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eschatonblog.com%2F&#038;as_qdr=all&#038;as_rights=&#038;as_occt=any&#038;cr=&#038;as_nlo=&#038;as_nhi=&#038;safe=images">DFH</a> leads Surowiecki to make invalid arguments, which he considers gestures of a willingness to compromise with people who want no change in regulation.</p>
<p>Everyone here already knows that I am a DFH so I just note that the arguments are invalid.</p>
<p>update:  From comments a correction.</p>
<blockquote><p>EconProph says:Today, 17.46.08“Robert, <br />I agree wholeheartedly with your methodological analysis (and also I suspect what would be your policy recommendations).  But, a data artifact:  the entry of financial corps into the Fortune 500 was an editorial decision of the magazine, not an economic phenomenon.  In decades past (70&#8217;s and earlier), the &#8220;Fortune 500&#8221; was properly called the &#8220;fortune 500 Industrials&#8221; (no banks, no transports, no retails) and a separate list of 100 largest banks/finance companies was published with it.  By the 1980&#8217;s the magazine decide to consolidate the lists since the industry boundaries had blurred.   </p></blockquote>
<p>ooops.</p>

<p>The Greenspan Fed, the 2000 Election, and the 2001 Recession</p>
<p>In the past, I&#8217;ve had a few posts on the Greenspan era Fed.  I&#8217;ve noted that some of its behavior seemed somewhat, er, biased, almost as if it the money supply was contracted a bit too much around election time when Democrats held the Presidency, and loosened a bit too much (no matter what George Herbert Walker said) if a Republican was in office.  In fact, I&#8217;ve noted that the recession of 2001 was partly caused by the excessive tightening of the Fed in 12 months leading up to the November elections in the face of a big decline in the stock market that occurred in March of 2000 and high oil prices.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve been (slowly) reading Greenspan&#8217;s book, The Age of Turbulence, and I have two quotes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, to foster this adjustment process, the Fed had tightened interest rates in a series of steps from July 1999 to June 2000.  We were hoping we might achieve another soft landing.  (p. 207)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The Fed&#8217;s response to all this uncertainty was to maintain our program of aggressively lowering-short term interest rates.  This extended a series of seven cuts we&#8217;d already made in early 2001 to mitigate the impact of the dot-com bust and the general stock market decline.  (p. 228)</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you provide an interpretation of events and these two quotes that is inconsistent with things I&#8217;ve noted in the past, and repeated in the first paragraph but doesn&#8217;t require us to assume that the Fed could completely overlook a stock market crash for three months, if not about year?  And if you do, don&#8217;t do like Uncle Alan &#8211; keep your dates straight; September 11, 2001 occurred in, well, September of 2001, not &#8220;early 2001.<br />_______________________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Right to Water</a><br />01 May 2009</p>
<p>I frequently say that was should be allocated on a &#8220;some for free, pay for more basis.&#8221; I borrowed this idea from South Africa, where water as a human right has been written into the constitution. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.emwis.net/thematicdirs/news/espagne-madrid-choisit-veolia-eau/thematicdirs/news/le-tribunal-de-johannesburg-fixe-le-droit-leau-42">an update</a> [in french] on the right to water there:</p>
<p>Johannesburg court determines the right to water at 42 liters per person per day. Recently the Court confirmed the illegality of using prepaid meters set at 42 litters per day per person to provide free water to the very poor people. </p>
<p>It must be noticed that the same amount is also used in Flanders in Belgium since 1997 for the free allocation of water. </p>
<p>Following the court case, a more advanced system of rates will be set-up in July to avoid the criticisms of the court on automatic disconnection in case of arrears. The Johannesburg experience has the merit to seek to reconcile the right to water and the pricing requirements that must be protected to ensure the continuity of the service.</p>
<p>Bottom Line: 42 liters is 11 gallons (a typical shower). Can you use less per day? If not, then be thankful that you have more 🙂</p>
<p>Update:  Try out a calculation <a target="_blank" href="http://www.tampagov.net/dept_water/information_resources/Saving_water/Water_use_calculator.asp">with a water calculator</a> and figure it out.  If you are navy you do not count. 🙂  My bet is we under report use.</p>
