                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">But several right-leaning fiscal experts described a balanced budget as a tool to force a fractious Congress to tackle the nation’s long-term budget problems.</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">“It is important to reduce the debt, and balancing gets you there faster,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a prominent Republican economist. “That’s paramount.”</p>
</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">He said a balanced budget is a goal everyone could understand. “It gives Congress a way to say no,” he said. “Transparency and political buy-in are important, and people understand balanced budgets. It has a lot of virtues.”</div>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/us/politics/balanced-budget-fight-is-philosophical-and-fiscal.html?pagewanted=all&#038;_r=1&#038;">Dispute Over a Balanced Budget Is Philosophical as Much as Fiscal</a>, Annie Lowrey, New York Times, today</div>
<p>So there we have it.  Balancing the budget is just a sales gimmick by Republicans to gut the federal government.  And they think it will work.  As both a sales gimmick and of course as a way to gut the federal government.  </p>
<p>People may understand what balanced budgets are, but they do not understand balanced budgets.  They would, if we had a president willing and able to explain such complexities to the masses, and to explain exactly what Holtz-Eakin just has, to the readers of today’s New York Times: that, while it is important to keep budget deficits below a certain level relative to revenue and relative to GDP over the long haul, it is not important to actually balance the federal budget. But the Republicans can convince the public that it is, because people understand the concept of balanced budgets, and can thereby, via semantics trickery, accomplish the Republican goal of gutting the federal government.</p>
<p>But we don’t.  Have a president who is willing and able to explain such complexities to the masses, that is. </p>
<p>We do, though, now have Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who has just provided a nice quote, should other Dem politicians recognize its value and decide to use it.  Here’s hoping. 
<div></div>
<div>&#8212;-</p>
<p>UPDATE: Regular AB reader and commenter rjs and I just had the following exchange in the Comments to my post:</p>
<p>rjs:  as an economist, he should know that <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/goldmans-jan-hatzius-on-sectoral-balances-2012-12">as long as we&#8217;re running trade defcits, it impossible for the feederal government to run a balanced budget while the private sector is deleveraging</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>Me:  He probably does know. But he also knows that the public doesn&#8217;t know that. (I didn&#8217;t.) And when you&#8217;re goal is really to gut the federal government, and you think you&#8217;ve found a way to con the public into thinking your goal is something else, that&#8217;s all that matters.</p>
<p>These people are downright diabolical.</p></div>

                                <p>A <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/world/asia/rains-or-not-india-is-falling-short-on-drinkable-water.html?emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y&#038;_r=0" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/world/asia/rains-or-not-india-is-falling-short-on-drinkable-water.html?emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y&#038;_r=0">New York Times reporter Gardner Harris</a> describes an issue that might jar some of our perceptions about access to potable water:</p>
<blockquote><p>Almost no place on Earth gets more rain than this small hill town. Nearly 40 feet falls every year — more than 12 times what Seattle gets. Storms often drop more than a foot a day. The monsoon is epic.</p>
<p>Water containers are lined up at a community tap in Cherrapunji. Some people must walk long distances to get water. </p>
<p>But during the dry season from November through March, many in this corner of India struggle to find water. Some are forced to walk long distances to fill jugs in springs or streams. Taps in Shillong, the capital of Meghalaya State, spout water for just a few hours a day. And when it arrives, the water is often not drinkable. <br />That people in one of the rainiest places on the planet struggle to get potable water is emblematic of the profound water challenges that India faces. Every year, about 600,000 Indian children die because of <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/symptoms/diarrhea/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">diarrhea</a> or <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/pneumonia/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">pneumonia</a>, often caused by toxic water and poor hygiene, according to <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/united_nations_childrens_fund/index.html?inline=nyt-org">Unicef</a>. </p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Some water problems stem from India’s difficult geography. Vast parts of the country are arid, and India has just 4 percent of the world’s fresh water shared among 16 percent of its people. </p>
<p>But the country’s struggle to provide water security to the 2.6 million residents of Meghalaya, blessed with more rain than almost any place, shows that the problems are not all environmental. </p></blockquote>

<p>But … but … we didn’t do this during the Reagan presidency&#8211;the presidency that was the very embodiment of fiscal responsibility!  Just as Paul Ryan said yet again just this very morning.</p>

<div dir="ltr">In subtle ways, Ryan’s budget acknowledges the results of November’s election. He isn’t seeking to do away with tax increases that have already been approved, and he accepts that tax revenue will be 19.1 percent of the economy in a decade, up from the 18.7 percent he assumed last year.</div>
<div dir="ltr">But otherwise, he continues to peddle the same ideas: the partial privatization of Medicare; a 10 percent reduction in the federal workforce; and cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, education, job training and farm programs.</div>
<div dir="ltr">Public Radio International’s Todd Zwillich pointed out that Republicans lost the presidency, House seats and the combined popular vote in House races. “People outside this process might wonder if elections have consequences,” Zwillich said.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“Look, whether the country intended it or not, we have divided government,” Ryan replied, suggesting that Republicans somehow won the debate while losing the election. “Are a lot of these solutions very popular, and did we win these arguments in the campaign?” Ryan asked himself. “Some of us think so.”</div>

<p>And those very same some of us think upside-down is rightside-up and aliens from Mars ate their calculator and their voter tabulations.  They need antipsychotic medication.  </p>
<div dir="ltr">He proposes abolishing Obamacare — a futile gesture — but would pocket for other purposes $1 trillion in tax increases that came with the program. &#8230;</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">CNN’s Dana Bash asked whether Ryan was being “disingenuous” by including new taxes that he opposed.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“We’re not going to refight the past,” he explained.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">If Ryan is “not going to fight the past,” Fox News’s Chad Pergram asked, why is he still trying to repeal Obamacare?</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“This to us is something that we’re not going to give up on,” Ryan answered, “because we’re not going to give up on destroying the health-care system for the American people.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Even a skilled illusionist can have the occasional Freudian slip.</div>

<p>Game’s over.  The mainstream media has had enough. They’re finally calling this spade a spade. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_N._Welch">Joe Welch</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/03/paul-ryan-is-joe-mccarthy-of-our-era.html">would be proud</a>. </p>
<p>At long last, Congressman, the people who matter see that you have left no sense of decency. Nor a semblance of mental health. Like Joe McCarthy.</p>

                                <p>Paul Ryan is, in effect, the Joe McCarthy of our era.  He consistently spews <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/03/12/paul_ryan_currency_debasement.html">outlandishly false statements of fact</a>, never offers actual evidence in support of them and never refutes factual challenges using actual and full facts, and <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/03/12/class_war_budgeting_paul_ryan_and_house_gop_want_more_money_for_the_rich.html">tries <i>as a matter of routine</i> to obfuscate his specific and broader objectives </a>and therefore to trick the public.  </p>
<p>He is a serious nutcase.  And yet he has garnered mainstream media attention as though what he puts out is credible.  We have a mainstream media that treats this nutjob as though he were a legitimate policy wonk. And that acts as though facts are legitimately in the eye of the beholder.  </p>
<p>If only Obama were more like Ike.  And if only there were an Edward R. Murrow around now, although a Walter Cronkite would do, too.  If only.  </p>
<p>Broadcast news, of course, no longer has nearly the power and audience it once had, but we now have the veritable <i>reverse</i> of what this country once had in its highest-profile journalists.  and we have a president who cowers in the face of whatever media juggernaut is currently saying &#8220;boo.&#8221;  </p>
<p>True, Ike was buoyed, not hindered, by the mainstream press when he helped end the McCarthy stranglehold.  And McCarthy and Eisenhower were, technically anyway, members of the same political party, so there was no insistence that Eisenhower humor McCarthy in the name of bipartisanship.  But there&#8217;s also no law that requires the president, this one or any other, to mindlessly do the mainstream media&#8217;s bidding if that bidding is in the name of bipartisanship.  At least not when bipartisanship means delegating fiscal policy to a rightwing faction of a minority party that a majority of voters recently pretty-darned-clearly  rejected.</p>
<p>This is getting really, really scary.  </p>

<p> Detroit Update</p>
<p> Today Former Mayor Kwame Kilpatrick was convicted in federal court of 24 felony courts of racketeering, extortion, mail fraud, bribery and tax evasion.</p>
<p>His chief henchman contractor Bobby Ferguson was convicted of 9 counts of racketeering and bribery.<br />Kilpatrick&#8217;s father was convicted of one count of tax evasion but the jury did not find him guilty on three extortion and bribery counts.</p>
<p>Jurors from the diverse jury expressed disgust after listening to and watching an immense amount of evidence.<br />Probably the biggest damage is that while Kilpatrick was running his criminal enterprise the City of Detroit was left to deteriorate and drift.</p>
<p>The next target of federal prosecutors may be Wayne County executives, perhaps including County Executive Robert Ficano.</p>

<div dir="ltr">President Obama won a second term in the White House in part by “dividing the country,” former Florida governor Jeb Bush (R) said in an interview that aired on Sunday morning.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“I think the basic part of his campaign was that those that were successful weren’t paying their fair share, even though we have incredibly high taxes for high income Americans,” Bush said on CBS News’ “Face The Nation.” “I think he ran a campaign of them and us. And it was quite effective, that somehow the Republicans don’t care about the large number of people.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Bush said in order to win future elections, Republicans have to offer a “compelling alternative” to that narrative, which he said was untrue. The former governor said he sees such an alternative view taking shape.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Bush’s appearance on “Face The Nation” was part of a Sunday show blitz. The former governor, who is promoting<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/book-review-immigration-wars-forging-an-american-solution-by-jeb-bush-and-clint-bolick/2013/03/08/31aab808-873e-11e2-9d71-f0feafdd1394_story.html"> a new book on immigration</a>, is<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/03/10/jeb-bush-obama-won-reelection-by-dividing-the-country/I%20think%20the%20basic%20part%20of%20his%20campaign%20was%20that%20those%20that%20were%20successful%20weren't%20paying%20their%20fair%20share,%20even%20though%20we%20have%20incredibly%20high%20taxes%20for%20high%20income%20Americans.%20I%20think%20he%20ran%20a%20campaign%20of%20them%20and%20us.%20And%20it%20was%20quite%20effective,%20that%20somehow%20the%20Republicans%20don't%20care%20about%20the%20large%20number%20of%20people."> appeared [sic] on five</a> Sunday news programs.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/03/10/jeb-bush-obama-won-reelection-by-dividing-the-country/"> Jeb Bush: Obama won reelection by ‘dividing the country’</a>, Sean Sullivan, Washington Post, yesterday</div>
<p>Well, last week’s big Jeb Bush news was all about the book he co-wrote last year with<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clint_Bolick"> Clint Bolick</a>, a five-star general in the rightwing-litigation wars during the past three decades.  The book is titled<a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/immigration-wars-jeb-bush/1113595090?cm_mmc=googlepla-_-book-_-q000000633-_-9781442361393&#038;cm_mmca2=pla&#038;ean=9781442361393&#038;isbn=9781442361393&#038;r=1"> Immigration Wars</a>.  In it, Bush, who, pre-Tea Party, had supported a yellow brick road to citizenship for illegal immigrants, reversed that position, making him look sort of like the Wizard of Oz.</p>
<p>This didn’t play well in the news media, or (I suspect) with much of the public, who thought that one Mitt Romney presidential campaign was more than enough, thank you very much.  </p>
<p>Not to worry, though.  Bush quickly explained that he and Bolick wrote that book last year, and, in light of the new recognition by the political right that, like defense spending cuts, this is not an issue worth losing national elections over, he’s changed his mind again.  Slightly. He’s once again okay with a path to citizenship, but only if that path doesn’t reward lawlessness.  By which he apparently was referring to crossing the border illegally and remaining here, not, say, mugging or murdering, although he probably doesn&#8217;t want to appear to be okay with those things, either. The path he now favors, at least as of yesterday, is shaped like a pretzel, I guess.  </p>
<p>The original, twisted ones, not the straight ones.  Similar to his own path on immigration issues.  <a href="http://www.staples.com/Rold-Gold-Tiny-Twists-Pretzels-1-oz-Bags-88-Bags-Box/product_354808?cid=PS:GooglePLAs:354808&#038;KPID=354808">Rolled Gold</a> and<a href="http://www.candyfavorites.com/snyders-pretzel-thins?gclid=CK-iv9ue9bUCFYqf4AodNUQAxQ"> Snyder’s of Hanover</a> might offer to lend him some sample molds. 
<div>
<div>
<div>As always for celebrity books, the publishing contract included a commitment to publicize the book.  Which undoubtedly sounded like a terrific idea not just to Bush’s publisher but also to Bush himself, back so many months ago.  Like last summer.  So instead of curling up with the Sunday comics on Sunday morning, as he surely would have preferred now that it’s the post-2012 election era, he made the Sunday talk show rounds.  (Actually, Bush might well have spent yesterday morning at home reading the comics; I didn’t watch the shows yesterday, but these days big-name folks pre-tape these interviews, I guess.)  </p>
<p>And, on at least one of those shows, Face the Nation, as the quote above shows, he claimed both that Obama falsely painted Romney’s 47% comment as indicating that somehow the Republicans don’t care about the large number of people, that Paul Ryan’s and Mitt Romney’s Ayn Rand budget proposals fooled people into thinking that somehow the Republicans don’t care about the large number of people, and that we have incredibly high taxes for high income Americans.  </p>
<p>Mitt and Ann Romney’s 13.9% tax rate indeed is incredibly high. And were it not for Obama’s outrageous dividing of the country, a majority of voters would have recognized that and voted for Romney because of his plan to cut income tax rates by 20% across the board.  Partly, of course, as a deficit-reduction technique, but also in order to be fairer to the wealthy&#8211;whose taxes would have been reduced hugely.</p>
<p>The election, of course, occurred before the Jan. 1 “fiscal cliff” deal that raised income tax rates on regular income above $450,000 for couples, and regular income above $400,000 for individuals, and that raised rates on investment income&#8211;capital gains, dividends, interest&#8211;from 15% to 20%.  So maybe Bush was just saying that taxes on the wealthy are <i>now</i> incredibly high, and that at the time of the election they were only very, very high.  As compared with, say, taxes on the wealthy throughout the seven decades before the presidency of his brother.  Including during the presidency and the vice presidency of his father.  And as compared to taxes on the wealthy in virtually every other modern capitalist democracy in the world.  And if you turn the charts and graphs upside-down, that&#8217;s clearly the case.</p>
<p>Except for Greece, whose hallmark fiscal policy was the ignoring of tax rates; everyone was entitled, apparently, to pick their own tax rate.  </p>
<p>Uh-oh.</p>
<p>Bush did say in that quote above that in order to win future elections, Republicans will have to offer a compelling alternative to the false narrative that a big problem for this country is spiraling income inequality (a.k.a., dividing the country) and that somehow the Republicans don’t care about the large number of people.  But luckily, he is offering one: We have incredibly high taxes for high income Americans.  </p>
<p>I think it’s going to be a winner!  Whew. Compelling.</p>

<p>Take Lincoln’s Approach to Hold “Untouchable” Fraudsters Accountable</p>
<p>Within recent months, two media events captured the attention of many Americans: the premier of the Spielberg movie “Lincoln” showcasing the 19th century federal government’s ability to end our nation’s crime against humanity; and, the airing of the PBS <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/business-economy-financial-crisis/untouchables/transcript-37/">Frontline series (“The Untouchables”)</a> showcasing the inability of the twenty-first century federal government to prosecute those responsible for our nation’s largest financial crime spree. </p>
<p>Now, the public watches mindless budgetary slashing of federal regulatory agencies – already underfunded and understaffed – charged with enforcing civil and voting rights and financial laws. And this “sequestration” proceeds at a time of widespread attempts to suppress people of color’s ability to cast ballots in federal elections, and financial fraud and abuse robbing and cutting the savings and assets of tens of millions of Americans. </p>
<p>Half Billion Dollars to be Cut from Fed Investor Protection, Law Enforcement   </p>
<p>Aside from federal civil and voting rights programs, investment law enforcement agencies and commissions on the chopping block include the Securities and Exchange Commission (a possible $115 million reduction), Commodity Futures Trading Commission ($17 million), federal courts ($384 million at risk), Public Accounting Oversight Board ($18 million) and the Securities Investor Protection Corporation ($23 million). In sum, $557 million could be cut from investor protection programs, barring Congressional intervention. For more, see Appendix A of the Office of Management and Budget report issued September 15, as required by <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/national/20120915-sequester/STAReport_sequester.pdf">The Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012</a>    </p>
<p>In this environment of federal inaction and cut-backs, it has never been more important for private citizens and investors to be given the legal tools and authority to protect themselves.</p>

<p>Lincoln Knew How to Deter Fraud: Hit Wrongdoers in their Pocket Books  </p>
<p>During the Civil War, Lincoln adroitly dealt with rampant fraud by Union Army contractors by empowering ordinary citizens with knowledge of the crimes to take civil action against wrongdoers on behalf of the government and themselves. Often called the “Lincoln Law,” the federal False Claims Act was modernized in 1987, with Republican Senator Charles Grassley leading the effort. Since then, whistleblowers acting under its authority and protection have recovered more than $40 billion of taxpayer money otherwise <a href="http://taf.org/fraud-cases#case406">lost to fraud and abuse</a> against federal and state governments.  </p>
<p>Nine billion dollars was recovered by citizens blowing the whistle during just one year (2012). Compare that with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s total of only $2.6 billion in funds recovered for investors from financial wrongdoers during the past three years during which people on “Main Street” have become painfully aware of <a href="http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/enf-actions-fc.shtml">their being fleeced by Wall Street.</a>    </p>
<p>What’s good for the taxpaying public would also be good for the investing public whose own personal funds are on the line. Although the withering federal government portion of the nation’s GDP (7 percent in 2012) is surprisingly close to the financial services industry’s contribution (5 percent), citizens <a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/2013/pdf/gdp4q12_2nd.pdf">can take very effective action</a>  against thieving federal contractors, but remain vulnerable against those who rob them of their homes, savings and investments. </p>
<p>Private Class Actions Recovered Three Times More for Investors than SEC    <br />True, citizens can and do band together into class action lawsuits to take action against financial robber barons and such civil actions have won $7.9 billion from wrongdoers in the past three years – three times the amount the SEC recovered during the same period. (See: <a href="http://www.cornerstone.com/securities_settlements_2011/">here</a>) </p>
<p>But, the class action remedy has been under an unremitting attack by corporate and financial lobbyists for almost two decades and has been trimmed and nearly hobbled by Congress and the Courts, with some notable exceptions, during the very period that may best fit Lincoln’s prophesied “era of corruption”:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I see in the near future a crisis approaching that unnerves me and causes me to tremble for the safety of my country….corporations have been enthroned and an era of corruption in high places will follow, and the money power of the country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the prejudices of the people until all wealth is aggregated in a few hands and the Republic is destroyed.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ratical.org/corporations/Lincoln.html">Corporations and Lincoln</a>    </p>
<p>So, where are we to turn to recover some of the wealth wrongfully “aggregated” from the many by the hands of the few?</p>
<p>Restore Private Accountability for Aiders and Abettors of Investment Fraud   </p>
<p>Certainly, securities class action lawsuits filed by pension funds, retirement plans and individuals against corporate and financial wrongdoers will continue to recover investor losses and nip at the heels of Lincoln’s “money power.” Private class actions could accomplish more to deter fraud and recover investor losses if Congress would overturn a misguided Supreme Court decision by restoring private liability for those who knowingly aid and abet securities fraud. </p>
<p>One early version of the Dodd Frank legislation would have done just that. Banking and accounting industry lobbying, however, killed that provision. Restoring accountability for aiders and abettors is a no-brainer that Congress can still accomplish.    <br />Fortunately, the final Dodd Frank Act did provide an opening for authorizing a “Lincoln Law” providing financial whistleblowers with the policing power to help hold Wall Street accountable and recover ill-gotten gains. </p>
<p>SEC Takes “No Further Action” on Majority of Whistleblower Leads </p>
<p>Congress provided for a “whistleblower” program within the Securities and Exchange Commission enabling people with inside information to contact the Commission. Those providing leads retain anonymity and can win monetary rewards. Despite receiving more than 3,000 leads in 2012, however, only one whistleblower has won an award ($50,000, an amount only equal to an annual bonus for a relatively low level Wall Street employee). </p>
<p>In any event, the SEC takes “no further action” on 69 percent of whistleblower complaints, according to a recent report by the <a href="http://www.sec-oig.gov/Reports/AuditsInspections/2013/511.pdf">SEC’s Inspector General.</a> The most common leads reported to the SEC relate to fraud and abuse in areas of systemic wrongdoing largely responsible for the financial meltdown: corporate disclosures and financial statements (18.2%); public offerings (15.5%); and, market manipulation (15.2%).</p>
<p>Powerful Senators (and the Public) Frustrated</p>
<p>The comments of two frustrated Senators during a 2010 hearing demonstrate that some powerful Members of Congress do understand what the public understands: big financial services malefactors are virtually “untouchable”:    </p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. Carl Levin (D-Michigan): “I believe in a free market. But if it’s going to be truly free, it cannot be designed for just a few people. It must be free of deception. It’s got to be free of conflicts of interest. It needs a cop on the beat, and it’s got to get back on Wall Street.”    </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa): “If heads don’t roll, nobody makes any changes. I’m disappointed that in all of the wrongdoing that went on and all the fraud that went on, that there wasn’t an effort to go after bigger fish than the evidence shows they [federal government] went after.”    </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/business-economy-financial-crisis/untouchables/transcript-37/">Transcripts PBS</a>    </p>
<p>Well, heads haven’t rolled Senator Grassley and, Senator Levin, there is still no effective cop on the Wall Street beat. </p>
<p>Congress Should Trust and Empower Lincoln’s “People”  </p>
<p>Now, its time for Lincoln’s “government of the people, by the people and for the people” to actually empower the people.     </p>
<p>First, Congress should restore the right of people to hold accountable those who knowingly aid and abet frauds that rob them.     </p>
<p>Next, Congress should enact a real financial “Lincoln Law” empowering whistle blowers with the tools to catch the “big fish” on Wall Street and make them pay back what they have stolen. And, recoveries should be returned to the investors harmed by the underlying fraud and abuse whistleblowers uncover. </p>
<p>The False Claims Act now on the books authorizes treble damages for those who defraud the government, providing a real deterrent. Moreover, the whistleblowers (termed “relators”) who win their civil actions against fraudsters can be awarded up to 30 percent of funds recovered – a powerful incentive for Wall Street managers who know where the bodies are buried to go after big time wrongdoers.</p>
<p>Time for a Financial False Claims Act  </p>
<p>A “Financial False Claims Act” should do the same by authorizing Wall Street whistle blowers to take actions independent of often conflicted government regulators against fraud perpetrators “too big to jail.” Such a law could also authorize the government to intervene in support of such civil actions, if they wish to do so. This is how the False Claims Act works. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, worried that a real whistleblower law could complicate the SEC’s program, the Commission’s inspector general has concluded that it is not the time to:</p>
<blockquote><p>[empower] whistleblowers or other individuals . . . to have a private right of action to bring suit . . . on behalf of the government and themselves, against persons who have committed securities fraud.</p></blockquote>

<div>Update: Application, clarification of &#8220;New world Order&#8221;.</div>
<div>I have put this update at the beginning of the post for I believe it is an aspect of my post on the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)  that should not be dismissed by myself nor by a reader of the post.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Now that I have had the day to contemplate J. Goodwin&#8217;s comment and after googling “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order" target="_blank">new world orde</a>r” </div>
<div>I can appreciate his concern and response.  I assure everyone, that last thing on my mind with the writing of that phrase was:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order" target="_blank">a conspiracy theory in which </a>a secret elite is conspiring to rule the world via world government and globalization. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The TPP is not being written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order" target="_blank">a secret elite looking to rule the world</a>.  On the contrary, the document is being written in secret such that we do not know the specific persons involved, but everyone knows the class or groups represented.   The authors/parties feeling of need for secrecy only speaks to their understanding of the potential opposition and not to a devious plot of mad scientist.  It&#8217;s not a James Bond story.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This TPP is not about ruling the world.  I very much doubt those involved want such a responsibility.   This document is about reducing the regulation a sovereign entity may apply to an investment to the point that any investment is almost certain to pay out whether by actually carrying out the investment or through reimbursement for not being able to carryout the investment.  Heads you lose, tails I win.  This is accomplished in many ways (kind of covering all bases) but mostly by giving a representative of an investment equality to a nation in the eyes of the “law”.  It is the elevation of an entity created solely for the purpose of profit (though there is some language toward nonprofit) all the rights and liberties that a nation of people reserve for themselves.  There is one thing the investment entity receives that the nation entity (“party” as used in the document) does not: A guarantee against loss.  This guarantee comes in the form of insurance.  The insurance is the full faith and credit of the nation&#8230;it is the ability to tax it&#8217;s citizens.</div>
<div></div>
<div>That is a new world order as in: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_World_Order" target="_blank">any period of history evidencing</a> a dramatic change in world political thought and the balance of power.</div>
<div>Thank you for reading.   </div>
<p>This past week the Trans Pacific Partnership agreement has been post worthy on a couple of the more read blogs.  There are specific groups working to get the public up to speed on this treaty.  One is the<a href="http://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/" target="_blank">  Citizens Trade Campaign.</a>    Crooks and Liars posted Lee Camps <a href="http://youtu.be/3M1o7bPNOGo" target="_blank">Moment of Clarity</a> episode regarding the treaty.   Common Dreams posted a video by<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/video/2013/03/08" target="_blank"> Friends of the Earth</a>.  This potential treaty has direct bearing on the subject of innovation, production and infrastructure as discussed in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/03/stormy-movie-guy-and-dan-becker-in-2009.html" target="_blank">the posts regarding Richard Elkus&#8217;s thesis </a>in his book Winner Take All and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/03/innovation-and-production.html" target="_blank">MIT&#8217;s latest report</a> on the subject.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Basically this is being referred to as NAFTA on steroids.  It is an agreement being negotiated in complete secrecy with only those considered to be a direct player called “clear trade advisers”(600 in the US) having access.  Direct players are not you and me, nor congress (you thought the drone unitary executive stuff is tough to get?  Ha!) nor that fourth branch known as the press.  Yes, Obama is up on this in that he is pushing it.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;ll let <a href="http://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/blog/2012/06/13/newly-leaked-tpp-investment-chapter-contains-special-rights-for-corporations/" target="_blank">Citizens Trade Campaign</a> sum it up: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>“The TPP is poised to become the largest free trade agreement in the world, potentially impacting jobs, wages, agriculture, migration, the environment, consumer safety, financial regulations, Internet protocols, government procurement and more.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The pact is currently under negotiation between the United States, Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam, but is being specifically written as a “docking agreement” that other countries can join over time.  Canada, Japan and Mexico are currently pressing to do so.  The thirteenth major round of TPP negotiations will be held at the Hilton San Diego Bayfront Hotel from July 2 – 10.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Recently a portion of this document was leaked.  It is called the “Investment Chapter”.  Public Citizens has a <a href="http://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/gtwtppinvestmentanalysis.pdf" target="_blank">review of it here</a>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I have read the first 17 pages of the <a href="http://www.citizenstrade.org/ctc/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/gtwtppinvestmentanalysis.pdf" target="_blank">Investment Chapter</a>.  It is these pages that provide the definitions and the cans and can nots for the signatories.  The remainder of the document provides the means for achieving satisfaction.  (Do read at least the definitions of what is considered “investment”.)  </div>
<div></div>
<div>What struck me in Public Citizens review was that the system being setup as the arbiter of the trade agreement is following the US&#8217; fascination with “extra judicial” proceedings as a viable means of following the ideals of our Constitution.   It&#8217;s those same thought processes that gave us rendition, enhanced interrogation, military tribunals, unitary executive.  You can&#8217;t help but see our past 35 years of leadership in the realm of pioneering new concepts in equality, fairness, justice, and processes to achieve such.  Concepts of “free market”, “invisible hand”, and process of deregulation, economies of scale, etc.   How else do you explain the use of rotating corporate tied lawyers as judges?  Where is the separation of the judge and the plaintiff?    This is right out of the current US play book on how to better your nation with the  social institution known as “revolving door”?</div>
<div></div>
<div>You can see in this document the culmination of work performed over the last 40 years (yes Carter started the deregulation) by the conservative (internationally known as neoliberal) ideology merged with Milton Friedman&#8217;s economics and Ayn Rand&#8217;s objectivism.  Dare I say, the TPP is to capitalism what our Constitution was to democracy?   </div>
<div></div>
<div>And that is where I really started thinking.  This document is not just about the particulars.  It&#8217;s not just about how trade will or will not happen, or whether a company will be able to privatize the gains and socialize the risks and losses, or whether people will be harmed.  All those things will be  the result of the document.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Nope, this document is much more. </div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>This document is the constitution of a new world order.  It is an order that has been the dream of many for ages upon ages that until this time in humanity was not possible do to the limits of the technology of the time.  This is the document of what I coined a few years ago as The United Corporations of Global.  It is this aspect of the document that the people of the world should be most fearful of.  It is not a trade agreement as I believe the common man (as in the court concept of the “common man”) would think of the phrase “trade agreement”.  This is a constitution that is coming prepackaged with the rules and regulations already written.  Only, there is no need for ratification to be a part of the creative process.  This document comes pre-ratified in that all a nation has to do is say “I&#8217;m in”.  It does not take a majority of the worlds nations or a super majority like the original 13 colonies for this document to have power.  It has power because those writing it already agree to follow it.  Passing it in the US?  Can you say “fast track”?   </div>
<div></div>
<div>The documents greatest power is what I alluded to when I mentioned rendition, unitary executive, enhanced interrogation, military tribunals.  Rationalization.  This document codifies the use of rationalization as a viable thought process for achieving the advancement of humanity.  It reinstates the fallibility of human thinking, turning on it&#8217;s head the enlightenment age because this document believes it is of enlightened thought.  It rationalizes as enlightenment the freeing of people to trade to the greatest level of monetary efficiency.  Such a thought is putting a human creation ahead of humanity. It is totally antithetical to the goal of enlightenment. ( I have to say, at this point our fellow Angry Bear Bruce Webb I hope will add to the discussion as our resident historian.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>What follows below are specific excerpts from the document.  It is legal speak.  But it is not hard to understand.  I feel it is important that people read these excerpts as this is how you will know the thinking and overall goal of the document beyond the obvious selfish power grab by any particular player or industry.  This is a document written by people who envision the world structured far differently than how we are taught to view our social organization based on the US Constitution and it&#8217;s meaning to the world.  It does not matter if you believe our national identity is a lot of myth, that we don&#8217;t hold up well to our constitutional ideals.  The fact is, the myths and ideals have influence and they are not the myths and ideals held by those writing the TPP at worst or are considered not applicable nor appropriate for their desired structure at least.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This document is not just about how nations will relate to each other, it also gives the same rights and privileges to individual investor entities as representative of a nation.  Thus, keep in mind that anything you read here also means a rich person or a business entity is treated as if they are the nation.  However, citizens are not at anytime mentioned as being a “party” of any type other than when it comes to citizens potentially creating a loss for a “party” or it&#8217;s investor representative.  In other words, “citizens” are at all times considered to have lesser status such that citizens have no claim to inalienable rights and the resultant rule of law.  It is less than slavery for in this document, the only recognized covered entities are “party” which means a nation of signature and it&#8217;s participants in the sector of said parties social interaction referred to as “investment”.   In fact, there is a defined party entity specifically that is not of the party:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>investor of a non-Party means, with respect to a Party, an investor that attempts to make, is making, or has made an investment in the territory of that Party, that is not an investor of a Party</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>There is nothing in the list of definitions that suggest or implies “citizen”.  The only entities covered and regulated by the TPP are those entities that are creations of man.   Man is of no consideration regarding the benefits of the relationships developed in this new constitution.   Man is only mentioned  as a consequence of potential harm to the “parties” in the form of financial loss.  That&#8217;s it.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>WE HAVE TO COME TO KNOW THE MIND OF THE DOCUMENT!  Even if we can prevent this document from taking effect, we will not put an end to the ideology behind the document if we only defeat the document based on it&#8217;s ability to do material harm.  We have to come to know the mind of this document so that we can be certain to identify the thought within the new words that will be written and spoken when those behind this document make their new attempt at forming the world according to their ideology.  We need to know the mind so that we can educate those who will certainly face the next attempt to implement such an ideology.  This is why the document is being created in such secrecy.  We have learned from NAFTA et al and those that are the mind of the document are aware of our knowledge.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>Thus I present the sections as they relate to what I  believe is the thinking of this new constitution so that we can be aware of the overriding concepts that ultimately reorder societies and would require a new thinking regarding who and what we are, what our purpose is and where we are going as a species on this planet.  The TPP is presenting a new ideal of social order.  It is one I that find represents the worst of humanity.     </div>

<div>This is where the sovereignty breaks down and the new social order is created:  </div>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>Article 12.4: National Treatment</div>
<div>1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.</div>
<div>2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of its own investors with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.</div>
<div>The treatment to be accorded by a Party under paragraphs 1 and 2 means, with respect to a regional level of government, treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment accorded, in like circumstances, by that regional level of government to investors, and to investments of investors, of the Party of which it forms a part.]</div>
<div></div>
<div>Article 12.5: Most-Favoured Nation Treatment</div>
<div>1. Each Party shall accord to investors of another Party treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investors of any other Party or of any non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments in its territory.</div>
<div>2. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment no less favourable than that it accords, in like circumstances, to investments in its territory of investors of any other Party or of any non-Party with respect to the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>This is where the responsibility is defined for achieving “favorable treatment”.  The “Party” is obliged to:</div>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>Article 12.6: Minimum Standard of Treatmentll</div>
<div>1. Each Party shall accord to covered investments treatment in accordance with customary international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.</div>
<div>2. For greater certainty, paragraph 1 prescribes the [applicable rules of] customary international law [minimum] standard of treatment of aliens as the [minimum] [general] standard of treatment to be afforded to covered investments. The concepts of &#8220;fair and equitable treatment&#8221; and &#8220;full protection and security&#8221; do not require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is required by that standard, and do not create additional substantive rights. The obligations in paragraph 1 to provide:</div>
<div>(a) &#8220;Fair and equitable treatment&#8221; includes the obligation not to deny justice in criminal, civil, or administrative adjudicatory proceedings in accordance with the principle of due process embodied in the principal legal systems of the world; and</div>
<div>(b) &#8220;Full protection and security&#8221; requires each Party to provide the level of police protection required under customary international law.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Who determines which party&#8217;s law is part of the “principle legal systems of the world”?   What is “customary”.  These are the phrases of those who are trying to hedge.  People agree to such language when they believe they have a hidden advantage.  This is not language of certainty.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is where the citizens of the world become hog tied:</div>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>Article 12.6bis: Treatment in Case of Armed Conflict or Civil Strife</div>
<div>1. Notwithstanding Article 12.9.5(b) (Non-Conforming Measures, subsidies and grants carveout), each Party shall accord to investors of another Party, and to covered investments, non-discriminatory treatment with respect to measures it adopts or maintains relating to losses suffered by investments in its territory owing to armed conflict or civil strife.</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, if an investor of a Party, in the situations referred to in paragraph 1, suffers a loss in the territory of another Party resulting from:</div>
<div>(a) requisitioning of its covered investment or part thereof by the latter&#8217;s forces or authorities; or</div>
<div>(b) destruction of its covered investment or part thereof by the latter&#8217;s forces or authorities, which was not required by the necessity of the situation, the latter Party shall provide the investor restitution, compensation, or both, as appropriate, for such loss. Any compensation shall be prompt, adequate, and effective in accordance with Article 12.12.2 through 12.12.4 (Expropriation and Compensation, paragraphs 2 through 4), mutatis mutandis.)</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Consider the XL pipe line protests.  With this agreement, the protestors will have put the citizens of our nation in jeopardy of having to pay for the losses.  In other words, a nations taxing apparatus is now bound as insurance against an investor&#8217;s loss.  Capitalism?  Read about <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/karoli/oil-company-lawsuit-could-set-dangerous" target="_blank">Excelaron and San LuisObispo County&#8217;s Huasna Valley. </a></div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div>This clause also pits a nation&#8217;s government against it&#8217;s people and pits it&#8217;s people against each other in that civil protest, maybe even strikes become compensatory offenses if a loss in incurred by an investor.  So, just how will a nation respond to assure it&#8217;s citizens “behave themselves” such that the other Party&#8217;s investor does not suffer a loss by means of social unrest?  </div>
<div></div>
<div>This is where loss of sovereignty is further accomplished as it relates to a nation determining how best to structure it&#8217;s economy.   </div>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>Article 12.7: Performance Requirements</div>
<div>1. No Party may, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, or sale or other disposition of an investment of an investor of a Party [or of a non-Party] in its territory, impose or enforce any requirement or enforce any commitment or undertaking: 12</div>
<div>(a) to export a given level or percentage of goods [or services] ;</div>
<div>(b) to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content;</div>
<div>(c) to purchase, use or accord a preference to goods produced in its territory, or to purchase goods from persons in its territory;</div>
<div>(d) to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with such investment;</div>
<div>( e) to restrict sales of goods [or services] in its territory that such investment produces [or supplies] by relating such sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings; [</div>
<div>(f) to transfer a particular technology, a production process or other proprietary knowledge to a person in its territory;] [or]</div>
<div>(g) to supply exclusively from the territory of the Party the goods that such investment procedures [or the services that it supplies] to a specific regional market or to the world market [; or</div>
<div>(h) (i) to purchase, use, or accord a preference to, in its territory, technology of the Party or persons of the Party13 ; or</div>
<div>(ii) that prevents the purchase or use of, or the according of a preference to, in its territory, particular technology, so as to afford protection on the basis of nationality to its own investors or investments or to technology of the Party or of persons of the Party] .</div>
<div>2. No Party may condition the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, or sale or other disposition of an investment in its territory of an investor of a Party [or of a non-Party,] on compliance with any requirement:</div>
<div>(a) to achieve a given level or percentage of domestic content;</div>
<div>(b) to purchase, use, or accord a preference to goods produced in its territory, or to purchase goods from persons in its territory;</div>
<div>(c) to relate in any way the volume or value of imports to the volume or value of exports or to the amount of foreign exchange inflows associated with such investment; or</div>
<div>(d) to restrict sales of goods [or services] in its territory that such investment produces [or supplies] by relating such sales in any way to the volume or value of its exports or foreign exchange earnings.</div>
<div>3. (a) Nothing in paragraph 2 shall be construed to prevent a Party from conditioning the receipt or continued receipt of an advantage, in connection with an investment in its territory of an investor of a Party [or of a non-Party,] on compliance with a requirement to locate production, supply a service, train or employ workers, construct or expand particular facilities, or carry out research and development, in its territory.</div>

<div></div>
<div>Again in the above section 12:7 we see the continuation of the individual/citizen carved out from the money.  Sure, a nation can make some demands, but those only refer to the citizen as work done within the investment and not as a beneficiary of the work done.  The benefits and results of the work done shall not be restricted by the host party of the investment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Section 12:7 does allow a nation to protect it&#8217;s natural resources and the environment by adopting laws however, they cannot be inconsistent with the TPP:<i> (i) necessary to secure compliance with laws and regulations </i><i>that are not inconsistent with this Agreement</i><i>;</i></div>
<div>Understand that what is consistent with the agreement is that the investment is protected at all times against not being fulfilled.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Lastly we see the final severing of a nations sovereignty; the loss of the right to have the host party represented within the investment entity.  </div>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>Article 12.8: Senior Management and Boards of Directors</div>
<div>1. No Party may require that an enterprise of that Party that is a covered investment appoint to senior management positions natural persons of any particular nationality.</div>
<div>2. A Party may require that a majority of the board of directors, or any committee thereof, of an enterprise of that Party that is a covered investment, be of a particular nationality, or resident in the territory of the Party, provided that the requirement does not materially impair the ability of the investor to exercise control over its investment.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Thus, you can put some people in positions that theoretically may have power to prevent the investing entity from harming your nation, but not so much as the hedge phrase is: materially impair.  This is another example of using “common man” language to hide the uncommon results.  Personally, this language sounds like a ripe area has been created for the allowance of corruption.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Consequently, what we have here is an agreement that the investing entity is protected via insurance in the form of the host nation&#8217;s taxing ability that becomes a mechanism for “encouraging” shall we say,  a host nation to take measures to assure it&#8217;s citizens remain compliant.  This is the new social order.  This is the corporate model of relationships.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Yes, there is a section concerning the protection of the environment and in general &#8212; health.  </div>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>Article 12.15: Investment and Environment] [ ,Health Safety and Labour] [ Article 12.15: Health Safety and Environmental Measures][</div>
<div>1. Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise consistent with this Chapter that it considers appropriate to ensure that investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental [ , health, safety, or labour] [ , health or safety] concerns.]</div>
<div></div>
<div>2. The Parties recognize that it is inappropriate to encourage investment by relaxing its health safety or environmental measures. Accordingly, a Party should not waive or otherwise derogate from or offer to waive or otherwise derogate from, such measures as an encouragement for the establishment, acquisition, expansion, or retention in its territory of an investment of an investor.]</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>It even talks about “Social Responsibility”.  But&#8230;it&#8217;s voluntary.</div>
<p>
<blockquote>
<div>Article 12.15 his: Corporate Social Responsibility</div>
<div>[ Each Party should encourage][ nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent a Party from encouraging] enterprises operating within its territory or subject to its jurisdiction to voluntarily incorporate internationally recognized standards of corporate social responsibility in their internal policies, such as statements of principle that have been endorsed or are supported by the Parties. [ These principles address issues such as labor, the environment, human rights, community relations and anti-corruption. The Parties remind those enterprises of the importance of incorporating such corporate social responsibility standards in their internal policies.]]</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Well isn&#8217;t that a fine one.  How do you encourage social responsibility when a nation can not dictate what is to happen to the resultant product of it&#8217;s citizens&#8217; work nor can their representatives on the board of the investment entity effect the management of the investment.  Most importantly how do you encourage such voluntary “responsible” activity when the host nation is on the hook for any loss of money that may result from the investment entity&#8217;s not so socially responsible actions that result in civil protest?  Remember, “civil strife” is specifically stated as a compensable event if it produces a loss for the investor.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What will this agreement do to the effort to get this world to wake up to the planet warming up?  How does this agreement prevent the furtherance of a naturally human trend of selfishness resulting in further policies of exclusivity and extraction of wealth (see: <a href="http://whynationsfail.com/" target="_blank">Why Nations Fail</a>)?  It doesn&#8217;t.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>That is what the ideals of our Constitution are supposedly about.  The recognition of the human mind&#8217;s frailties and a governance structure to assure such frailties do the least amount of harm.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>The further we go with implementing these types of agreements the further removed we are from the enlightenment concepts that resulted in a group of people writing prose such as our Constitution.  You can forget about the ideal bound in our Declaration of Independence.  And, the further we are moved toward the model of business organization as the dominate model for structuring a society.  It is too accepted that the purpose of business is to make money.  There is no longer any talk of “social responsibility” within today&#8217;s business model.  Business no longer is a means for creating wealth that society then puts to work in reducing life&#8217;s risks.  Business is simply about making money&#8230;stop.  The declaration for the TTP would simply read: <i>We hold this truth to be self-evident, the purpose of business is to make money.</i>  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Isn&#8217;t it ironic that in science fiction, a common theme is the threat of man creating an artificial entity that ultimately comes to dominate it&#8217;s creator.  It&#8217;s a robot, a computer, some kind of machine even biological or any combination or all 3.  We obtained the power of the creator only to realize our ignorance toward the full potential of all there is to know.  The theme is always dismissed as artistic fun.  One thing always is consistent with such stories and dreams.  At no time is this entity ever not recognized as nonhuman.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Yet, in truth we have created and are willingly moving our self into such a living situation: the corporate structure for managing human relationships. The corporate structure is a creation of man (I don&#8217;t think a woman is credited with this considering the position of women in centuries past).  It is a creation that we have been investing with human social stature and traits.  We made this thing.  We have given it “personhood”.  (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood" target="_blank">Personhood is</a> the status of being a person.)  With that birth we have also given it standing within the circle of human relations.   It is the physics of two entities occupying the same space in that the corporation is both human in action and representative of human action.  And, we have given it one thing that humans do not have and the one thing that is the singular moment of all human endeavor: the real potential of eternal life.  The corporation has the ability to do what we can&#8217;t: defy death. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The science fiction writers had it correct as to our drive, they were just looking at the wrong sciences.  It&#8217;s not the material life that will do us in.  It is the cognitive life that has the most potential to do us in.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Trans Pacific Partnership agreement is the realization of our self destruction potential.</div>
