<blockquote><p>In an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/business/economy/despite-job-vacancies-employers-shy-away-from-hiring.html">article</a> on Thursday’s front page, I wrote about how long job vacancies are taking to fill, especially when you consider the abundance of unemployed workers.Economists have been thinking about this issue for a couple of years now thanks to a shift in what is known as the Beveridge Curve<br />&#8230;.<br />,,,shows the relationship between the unemployment rate and the job vacancy rate.Since late 2009, the curve has shifted outward. That means that even if the job market is not exactly booming, there are more vacancies out there than the unemployment rate alone would have predicted a few years ago.</p></blockquote>

<p>This is probably true for some highly coveted occupations that require specialized skills, like nursing or engineering, that have a mismatch in skill sets between workers left out of other industries. In addition, there are now a lot of long-term unemployed workers whose skills may have deteriorated&#8230;(but if there were a shortage of qualified workers across a lot of industries, you would be seeing employers bid up wages for the few candidates who <em>were</em> desirable). That does not appear to be happening.)</p>
<p>Another explanation those who are calling themselves unemployed today would have been counted as unemployed sooner in the past as longer unemployment benefits impact stats (such as with a faster declining labor participation rate). Employers have vacancies but are afraid to fill them?&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>So Whose Wealth Is At a Record High?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://news.msn.com/us/us-household-wealth-regains-pre-recession-peak">This news story</a> must be good news for some folks:<br />
<blockquote>According to the Federal Reserve, household wealth amounted to $66.1 trillion at the end of 2012 and further gains in stock and house prices have allowed Americans to make up for the losses incurred during the recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you want to protest that not everyone has recovered their lost wealth, the story sort of concedes this further down:<br />
<blockquote>The recovered wealth — most of it from higher stock prices — has been flowing mainly to richer Americans. By contrast, middle class wealth is mostly in the form of home equity, which has risen much less.</p></blockquote>
<p>Households owners&#8217; equity in real estate peaked at $12.5 billion in 2005 and then plummeted. While it has partially recovered, it was only $8.2 billion at the end of 2012 according to the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1">Flow of Funds Accounts</a>. Given that consumer prices have risen by almost 20 percent over this period, our equity in real estate is still far below its 2005 peak value.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rj-eskow/a-president-wholl-cut-soc_b_2835274.html%22Richard">Richard Eskow</a>  points us to a trend with liberals media types and Social Security:</p>
<blockquote><p>A President Who&#8217;ll Cut Social Security &#8212; And Liberals Who Love Him Too Much</p>
<p>The spectacle of a supposedly liberal president repeatedly and needlessly trying to cut Social Security is enough to bring a reasonable, economically literate person to the point of existential despair. To see leading liberal lights like Rachel Maddow and Ezra Klein chuckle indulgently at those foolish Republicans in Congress over the subject &#8212; <i>Don&#8217;t they know he&#8217;s already giving them what they want? </i>&#8212; is to risk plunging into the depths of that despair.</p>
<p>This week the president hosted a dinner for Republicans leaders where he worked to sell his budget proposal, including his harmful plan to cut benefits through the &#8220;chained CPI.&#8221; National Security was the main course and Social Security was the dessert. And guess who <i>wasn&#8217;t</i> coming to dinner: The elderly, the disabled, or any policy experts who understand the disastrous implications of the chained CPI.</p>
<p>The Maddow/Klein exchange (which we&#8217;ll bring to you as soon as a transcript is available) is the crest of a building wave in pro-Democratic Party commentary which says, as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/01/what-we-have-here-is-a-failure-to-communicate/">Klein</a> puts it, that &#8220;what we have here is a failure to communicate.&#8221; Klein says that at least &#8220;some of the gridlock (in Washington) is due to poor information.&#8221; Jonathan Chait <a href="http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2013/03/would-teaching-republicans-about-obama-help.html">bemoans</a> the fact that Republicans &#8220;won&#8217;t acknowledge [Obama&#8217;s] actual offer, which includes large cuts to retirement programs.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But Democrats like Maddow, Klein, and Chait know better. They know exactly what Obama&#8217;s been trying to do.  And their only complaint seems to be that he&#8217;s not doing effectively enough. We&#8217;re not hearing much from the &#8216;left&#8217; side of the debate about the profound flaws, biases, and inherent cynicism behind both the President&#8217;s policy and his rhetoric.</p>
<p>Here are the facts:<br />1.Research suggests that Social Security cost-of-living increases are already inadequate. (See studies on &#8220;CPI-E&#8221; for more details on the best ways to increase them.)</p>
<p>2.Obama&#8217;s proposed chained-CPI cut would typically reduce benefits for 3 percent, and by as much as 6 percent for some recipients.</p>
<p>3.The White House&#8217;s decision to label this cut the &#8220;superlative CPI&#8221; is grotesque. It suggests that elderly women who receive an average of $950 or so per month are receiving &#8220;superlative&#8221; benefit increases each year.</p>
<p>4.The administration&#8217;s insistence on speaking of &#8220;entitlement reform,&#8221; mixing Medicare (which has a real cost problem because of our for-profit health system) with Social Security, is a cheap trick first devised by Republican consultants.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>From Stormy, who has not written in awhile but sends back an e-mail on the discovery that we are losing competitive advantage:</p>
<p>I find it absolutely stunning that the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Yves post and MIT study</a> below is considered big news.  Four or five years ago,  I saw the writing on the wall.  Off-shoring, outsourcing&#8230;name of the game.  All the blather about new technology was just that: blather—otherwise, how do we explain China?  It uses cheap labor &#8230;as does Vietnam, Mexico&#8230;on and on.  Apple and IBM are the poster children of the modus operandi.  They are American companies in name only.</p>
<p>Eventually, I just gave up singing the song.  All the big economic voices have their lips up the assholes of corporate profit&#8230;and it smells sweet to them.  Globallization—poorly designed for all us schmucks.  It was designed for the rich&#8230;.end of story.</p>
<p>WTO rules?  Ok: Last time.  China played that WTO game by stiffing its own companies to lure the multi-corporations to set up house on Chinese soil.  Chinese firms were taxed at twice the rate of foreign firms.  Non-existent environmental standards in China, which lowered the cost of doing business.  Unions?  None.  Lowered the cost of doing business.  Cheap, slave labor.   I could continue&#8230;but what is the use?  And of course: monetary manipulation.  Make cheap in China—sell high in the West.  Where were the big economic voices?</p>
<p>And what did the U.S. do?  Worry about the consumer stepping up to the plate!&#8212;banks charged uxorious rates for credit cards and loans.  Extending risky credit was the name of the game.  Get every last penny from the American consumer.</p>
<p>Sorry to get so annoyed.  I saw all the stupid arguments&#8230;they were dodges.  Clinton gave Phil Gramm a big wet kiss –and signed the Financial Modernization Act of 1999.  Then he told us NAFTA was a win-win&#8230;. create jobs at home.  Yup Yup.  Then Clinton joined the lobbyist crowd and made his millions.  Now we have Obama his loves the big CEO`s&#8212;</p>
<p>Obama’s efforts to stem outsourcing/offshoring have been silly.  Obama’s solution? Cut taxes on corporations to keep them here.   China gave tax free ten-year holidays to many corporations.  O think he is going to match that?  His strategy is classic economic stupidity&#8230;a knee jerk solution.   And will O match the cheap labor costs?  Will he match the low environmental standards?   Will he call a halt to monetary manipulation?  I suggest, play Name the Corporation who hates American.   Name the corporations and the CEO who have shipped jobs overseas—only to send the goods back home. </p>
<p>Shame them.  Make it difficult for them.  Put a tariff on all goods made abroad by American companies—and exported here.  Revisit the idea of what a corporate charter means.  Take it away from corporations who consistently stiff us.</p>
<p>Close down tax havens.  Get serious about them.  Christ, if we think Iraq and Iran are problems&#8230;.what about Bermuda?  Close it down.  I am serious.  Send in the marines.  If we cannot think of ways of really hurting Bermuda and similar uglies&#8230;.we do not have a country interested in defending itself.</p>
<p>And change the rules of the WTO: Countries must have environment and labor standards.   Countries cannot have a two-tiered taxation system—one for indigenous and one for foreign firms.  All must be equal.  No advantages to foreign firms in order to lure them.    Otherwise, ditch the WTO.  </p>
<p>It will take a major revolution or an outright collapse to stop all this nonsense.  And with Global warming, pollution, resource lost, etc. Etc&#8230;. we do not have much time.</p>
<p>We have to start thinking outside the box.  And listen to the squeals from the very rich.</p>

<div dir="ltr">By turning his efforts to the inside game, the president is momentarily turning away from the “campaign style” tours around the country, which he had hoped would help put pressure on Washington lawmakers. Some might suggest the switch renders a final verdict on the folly of pursuing that kind of outside game. It doesn’t. Campaigning for policies is not antithetical to leadership, it is leadership. All great presidents have done this. Republicans who decry Obama’s tactics might remember that George Bush took 66 trips around the country to sell his Social Security plan. The failure of that effort highlights again that the key question should be about effectiveness. The problem is not the method itself but whether the president is using it at the right moment.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/03/barack_obama_s_invites_republicans_to_the_white_house_the_president_s_effort.single.html">Welcome to the White House: Obama reaching out to Republicans isn’t anything new. It’s just that he’s never made it work</a>., John Dickerson, Slate, today</div>
<p>I’m a longtime Slate devotee, and as part of that devotion I’ve had a longtime love-hate relationship with John Dickerson, Slate’s chief political correspondent. By which I mean that I either love or hate his columns, in about even percentages.  </p>
<p>Today’s column is one of the best political analyses I’ve read in a while.  It’s long, and really deconstructs several of the incessant political-pundit truisms, sophisms, false analogies, and outright falsehoods that masquerade right now as political analysis concerning Obama, political &#8220;leadership,” and political leadership.  </p>
<p>No redundancy in that last sentence.  Really.  Which is Dickerson’s point. </p>
<p>That quote, above, is from the latter part of the column, and it speaks for itself.  It also speaks for me, since I’ve been saying that, repeatedly, here in AB.  But I want to add this to that quote: It’s absolutely true that the problem is not the method itself, if by “method” he means campaigning for policies.  But it’s also true that there is more to the likelihood of its success than whether the president is using it at the right moment.  How he campaigns publicly for policies, as well as when he campaigns publicly for policies, is crucial.  And a hallmark of Obama’s presidency is, in my opinion, stupifying ineptitude in both respects. </p>
<p>The first part of Dickerson’s article proves false the lazy political analogies offered by so many pundits between Obama’s situation and LBJ’s, and between Obama’s situation and Reagan’s, as the pundits offer those analogies: The earlier presidents’ effective working of the “inside game.”  But it is the outside game&#8211;the persuading-the-public part&#8211;where Obama incomprehensibly and repeatedly fails and where he should be unflatteringly compared with past presidents.  With virtually all part presidents, in fact&#8211;including George W. Bush, who Dickerson points out campaigned extensively for his Social Security privatization policy proposal in 2005 and lost the policy argument.</p>
<p>These presidents&#8211;none of them&#8211;failed to educate the public about what their policy proposals were, and, when relevant, what the opposition’s policy proposals were.   And&#8211;incredibly important concerning issues on which the public does not have the basic facts relevant to the policy proposal&#8211;these presidents (no other president, I’d bet) failed, on issue after issue after issue, to educate the public about the facts necessary to assess the policy proposal or the competing policy proposals. </p>
<p>Last week, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/02/only-6-of-public-knows-deficit-is.html">Dan Crawford linked to</a> <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2013/02/only-6-of-public-knows-deficit-is.html">a Barkley Rosser post</a> at Econospeak from Feb. 27 saying that polling indicates that only 6% of the public knows that the deficit is declining.  Here’s what Rosser said:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Yes, here we go again, massive public ignorance post # I forget how many.  This has been floating around out there for awhile but was on Rachel Maddow last night, and here is a link with suitable discussion of relevant facts from Dave Johnson, perhaps important as this silly sequester is about to land on us supposedly driven by the overwhelming need to get the deficit under control,<a href="http://blog.ourfuture.org/20130226/deficit-is-falling-dramatically-but-only-6-know-that">http://blog.ourfuture.org/20130226/deficit-is-falling-dramatically-but-only-6-know-that</a> .  As it is, apparently 62% think it is rising, while 28% think it is constant.  </p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">Among things that the public is wrong about, this one sticks out for being so far off from the facts.  And as is noted, not only is the deficit declining, but it is doing so at a very dramatic rate.  Without doing anything we should be able to stabilize the debt/GDP ratio within about two to three years, although to maintain that down the road, further adjustments would need to be made.  Being an austerian is one thing, but being completely out of touch with reality is quite another.</div>
<p>Obama consistently cedes public opinion to the right by allowing the right to profoundly misinform the public about critical facts.  Why does he do this? </p>
<p>Last week, a day or two before the sequester took hold, he went to a town near a naval base in Virginia to stand among people who stood to lose their jobs or be furloughed temporarily from the sequester.  It was, of course, supposed to illustrate that the sequester would hurt the economy.  But most people don’t live near a military base and most people don’t work for a defense contractor.  </p>
<p>What he needed to do instead is what he’s needed to do all along: explain Keynesian economics; use statistics to show that a key reason why the economy has been so slow to recover is that governments at all levels have reduced their spending (state and local governments, dramatically); show the public, using charts and specifics, that the 2011 debt ceiling deal included huge spending cuts and no tax increases; and make clear what tax increases, and on whom and what, you are proposing (e.g., what loopholes you’re proposing to close).  </p>
<p>The only headway he’s made politically on this was from his one recent foray into meaningfully explaining some of this to the public, in a press conference in (I think) mid-January.  The centrist pundits were deeply offended by it, but it got enough publicity that the general public understood important facts that they did not before.  </p>
<p>I don’t expect that Obama will actually speak live on TV to the public during primetime for about 10 minutes (which is all it would take) to actually provide important information in a way that would reach a lot of people. That would be just so LBJ.  Or Ronald Reagan.  Or Bill Clinton.  Or George W. Bush.  It’s much better, or at least (apparently) a lot easier, to give away the store, because the centrist pundits will applaud.  So that is what I expect that Obama will decide to do, and what he will do if the Senate Dems allow it.  </p>

<p>This was one of the better employment reports of this cycle.  Private payroll employment grew 246,00<br />while  government employment fell about 10,000 for a net gian of of 236,000.  The household survey also showed a nice gain of 170,000.</p>

<p>On a year over year change basis both series are showing nice gains.</p>

<p>You would never know it to listen to the news, but employment in this cycle continues to better than in the previous   cycle.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CrLrDanMoVo/UTnz3EldwAI/AAAAAAAACcc/C4W-X8mSbBg/s1600/Clipboard01+cycle.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CrLrDanMoVo/UTnz3EldwAI/AAAAAAAACcc/C4W-X8mSbBg/s320/Clipboard01+cycle.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>The workweek also increased 0.1% and the index of aggregate hours worked grew 0.5% of all workers and 0.9% for production workers.  The index is now back to the trend established early in the cycle.</p>

<p>An excerpt from one of Dan&#8217;s posts:</p>
<p>I have written at AB that my thoughts about when the flash point was for our change to a focus on making money from money was the first Reagan election. I do believe this is the case however, having finished reading Richard J Elkus&#8217; book, <em><strong>Winner Take All</strong></em>, I now have learned of a perspective as to why it flashed and why we are bailing out finance with more money and fewer questions than bailing out the auto industry. I also see just how back ass-ward this bailing out concern is.<br />    <br />You see, the thought that the purpose of business is to make money was not always the winner in the argument. The argument has been back and forth for ages. It is part of the class war. In fact, there was a movie in 1954 with William Holden looking at this issue called <a href="http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=3001">Executive Suite</a>. <br />
<blockquote>&#8230;McDonald Walling, who oversees the company&#8217;s manufacturing plant and is preparing to test a new molding process&#8230; process did not go well in his absence. On the way home, he complains to his wife Mary that financial analyst Loren Phineas Shaw focuses on the bottom line at the expense of the company&#8217;s creativity&#8230;McDonald speaks passionately about the company, condemning Shaw&#8217;s short-sighted emphasis on quick profits as &#8220;a lack of faith in the future.&#8221; After McDonald outlines his vision for restoring the company to its former high standards, the board unanimously elects him president.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>We have not always thought that the purpose of business is just to make money.  </p>
<p>Mr. Elkus&#8217; (MBA) thesis is that in the 60&#8217;s, two laws of economic process were formalized and presented that were the guiding thoughts influencing economic development. Both lines of thinking came from viewing the same show: semiconductors. One is by Mr. Bruce Henderson (engineer and MBA degrees) the other by Mr. Gordon Moore (PhD chemistry). Both addressed the relationship of costs and production. I note the degrees of each just as a curiosity.   </p>
<p>Mr. Henderson, watching Texas Instrument, came up with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects">Experience Curve</a>. In it&#8217;s simplest form it states that unit cost goes down over time as experience increases.  </p>
<p>But, this was just the bases for a broader concept, a “strategy” for guiding business development: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth-share_matrix">Stars, Cash Cows and Dogs</a>.   <br />
<blockquote>As a particular industry matures and its growth slows, all business units become either cash cows or dogs. The natural cycle for most business units is that they start as question marks, then turn into stars. Eventually the market stops growing thus the business unit becomes a cash cow. At the end of the cycle the cash cow turns into a dog.   <br />The overall goal of this ranking was to help corporate analysts decide which of their business units to fund, and how much; and which units to sell.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was and appears to still be a very big concept. Big as in influential. Via Wiki:   <br />
<blockquote>The Economist magazine stated that Henderson did more to change the way business is done in the United States than any other man in American business history. Well known to many now is the famous Growth Share Matrix (&#8216;cash cow&#8217;) and the &#8216;Experience curve&#8217;. His books were published in 27 languages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huge influence. Taught throughout our business schools according to Mr. Elkus and Wiki. Came about in 1970.   <br />Mr. Moore, being a founder of semiconductor manufacturing businesses, namely Intel, came up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore&#8217;s Law</a>. In it&#8217;s simplest form, it states that there would be <em>“a doubling of computing power per given area of silicon every year at basically the same cost&#8230;”</em>  <br /><em><br /></em> Mr. Elkus&#8217;s thesis is that both describe models, ultimately truths regarding making money. Both are used as strategies for basing an economy upon. Only one is truly sustainable and makes all of America&#8217;s dreams possible. Japan picked that one.   </p>
<p>He comes to this by way of his involvement with Ampex. Ampex owned video recording <em>“&#8230;controlling nearly 100 percent of the world&#8217;s video recording patents and more than 70 % of the market”</em>. Mr. Elkus literally introduced the first video recorder for home use, September 2, 1970 in NY. In the next few days, Ampex stock climbed 50%. Only one VP attended, no other top/senior management. <em>“It was not a good sign.”</em>His lesson from the event: <em>“The introduction of Instavideo set in motion a long chain of events, resulting not only in the explosion of consumer electronics into nearly every facet of daily life but in a global shift in economic power to Asia.”</em>  <br /><em><br /></em> In the same year, he saw a presentation of high definition video by Japan&#8217;s “primary” broadcasting company, NHK. It is at this point in the story Mr. Elkus relays the concept of convergence of technology. The ability to record video on a consumer level scale represented the ability to store and process massive amounts of data. This ability converging with digital video presentation meant that the entire information economy would be exponentially growing based on Moore&#8217;s Law. Mr. Henderson&#8217;s potential Star. Moore&#8217;s law also meant that as the ability to process ever larger amounts of data on ever smaller media, the cost would be ever greater. Mr. Henderson&#8217;s potential Dog. What to do?  </p>
<p>Mr. Elkus knew Ampex needed a partner that could take the technology to the consumer. Coming up with the technology, he recognized is only part of the expertise and cost, the other is the ability to manufacture it such that technology, in short, is dummy proof in the hands of the consumer. It is an ability all of it&#8217;s own. Mr. Elkus wanted Magnavox or Motorola as partners; keep it in the country. The boss said no, feared competition so went with Toshiba. This gets us to the next part of Mr. Elkus&#8217; thesis: Infrastructure. Which gets to the final cog in the process: investment.  </p>
<p>Using his experience with Ampex&#8217;s Instavideo, Mr. Elkus presents the counter to Mr. Henderson&#8217;s Stars, Cash Cow&#8217;s and Dogs: Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure. A relational model that follows the production law of Moore.   </p>
<p>What the thesis of Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure means to a nation is presented in the tracing of the loss of our manufacturing base to initially Japan and ultimately to all of Asia. It is the counter to Mr. Henderson&#8217;s model which is basically just focusing on the money. It is the movie Executive Suite for real only for us, the story ending is looking different.   </p>
<p>The relationship of Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure is presented early in the book via Zenith. There was a fight for control of the board as reported by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/business/company-news-zenith-criticizes-dissident-group.html">AP 11/1988</a>. A couple Wall Streeters wanted Zenith to dump the <em>“money-losing television business”. </em>The dog. The article also noted: <em>“for an outsider, jumping into the TV business would be like trying to hop onto a speeding train&#8230;”</em> In the end, Zenith a company that <em>“helped establish the standards for high definition television in the US,&#8230; contributing significant technology for the potential development of the industry”</em> was gone by 1996 to LG of Korea <em>“for a fraction of what it now costs to build a single display manufacturing facility”. </em>We lost our infrastructure and thus the advantage of economic growth based on convergence and all the knowledge that is the result there of because of our focus on cash flow as the bases for deciding on where to invest.   </p>
<p>Using a simpler example:   <br />
<blockquote>In 1964, one year before Gordon Moore wrote his prophetic article, semiconductor sales reached $1 billion. Today sales are in excess of $260 billion, it is projected that in a dozen years the number may reach $1 trillion. And growth in revenue has occurred while prices have dropped at an average compound rate of 29 % annually&#8230;But that is really chump change when you realize that $260 billion of silicon makes possible a $2 trillion electronic systems industry today&#8230;So it is possible to imagine an electronic systems market approaching $4 trillion to $5 trillion in the next twelve to fifteen years—an amount equal to the current GDP of Japan&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The error of US having followed Henderson, which if I understand Elkus properly, I conclude has lead to NAFTA, outsourcing jobs and ultimately the fight over whether to save our auto industry (which I noted is the last “infrastructure” we have that uses “convergence” via “investment”) verses little questioning to save the banks is summarized thusly:   <br />
<blockquote>The common denominator driving the world of information and its communications infrastructure was the need to store, process and distribute extraordinary amounts of digital information. [Store = Ampex. Process = Intel. Distribute = Zenith.] If one understands HDTV as the result of learning how to process massive amounts of digital information, as both a convergence and catalyst in the digital revolution, then it should be easy to see that the need to process that information is not limited to the HDTV display and a pretty picture&#8230;. </p></blockquote>
<p>It now costs upward of $10 billion to build just one semiconductor manufacturing plant. $3 billion to build a single display fabrication facility. Zenith was sold for $350 million. Based on <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/compare/">Measuring Worth</a>, 1996 to 2008 these money minds following Henderson, sold Zenith for 1/6th the cost required to build just one display panel plant in 2008. This number differential is the total fallacy in Henderson. How do you know? How do you know what really is the next big thing? How can you be sure that nothing else will come of what you have? It is the &#8220;The Guitar Player&#8221;. But worst of all as shown in the example of selling Zenith, is just how short sighted Henderson&#8217;s thinking and thus American business thinking is in general. If I may, Henderson&#8217;s thinking is analogous to watching your rear view mirror while driving forward as you decide whether to turn or drive straight. Henderson&#8217;s thinking is the point of thought that began the money from money economy. It is the thought that lead us to a purposeless existence of no substance because it leaves unanswered the question of why do we want to earn money or create wealth, for what purpose.   </p>
<p>Mr. Elkus gave a <a href="http://fora.tv/2008/09/03/Richard_Elkus_Competitiveness_Shapes_the_Fate_of_Nations">talk at The Commonwealth Club</a> in California on 9/3/08. It covers a time line of what he is writes in his book. It is one hour long, but well worth the time, especially <a href="http://fora.tv/2008/09/03/Richard_Elkus_Competitiveness_Shapes_the_Fate_of_Nations#chapter_15">the question at the end</a> regarding Apple&#8217;s business arrangement regarding it&#8217;s Iphone as the questioner brings up “competitive advantage” and money from royalties. You know, that information/service economy model that has gotten us to the point that the biggest service sector (finance) took down the economy and the next largest is unaffordable(health care).  <br />The most profound comment by Mr. Elkus during this lecture is: <strong><em>If you don&#8217;t have the infrastructure, then you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s possible.</em></strong>  <br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong> How far reaching is this persepctive of Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure? Mr. Elkus suggests that even our <a href="http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=7285">education system</a> is influenced by it.   <br />
<blockquote>When a nation’s politics and economics fall out of step with its education system, the cost of reengagement is extraordinarily high.</p>
<p>Therefore any attempt to explain the plight of education in America must look first at the country’s current political and economic attitudes. They are directly linked. </p>
<p>Eventually, because of the exponential acceleration in convergence, infrastructure, and investment, there’s a cascading effect, and the loss of one industry begins to threaten the stability of others.</p>
<p>These events are noticed by the educational community, which must provide a measure of career guidance for its student population and thus looks to political, economic, and business leaders for answers.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have Intel fortunately, but we don&#8217;t have the infrastructure of Zenith which would have been using Intels output to market Ampex&#8217;s technology which lead to the Iphone.</p>

<p>From that post is this excerpt:</p>
<p>And a <a href="http://web.mit.edu/press/images/documents/pie-report.pdf">new report</a> by MIT on innovation and production (hat tip Marcy Wheeler) has an almost desperate undertone. It starts by pointing out how the data understate how bad the competitive erosion is:<br />
<blockquote>One of the key danger points identified in these reports is the declining weight of the U.S. in the global economy. Even though the U.S. share of world manufactured output has held fairly steady over the past decade, economists have pointed out that this reflects good results in only a few industrial sectors. And even in those sectors, what appear to be productivity gains may be the result of underestimating the value of imported components. A close look at the composition of a worsening trade deficit shows that even in high-tech sectors the U.S. has a deteriorating picture. While the output of U.S. high tech manufacturing is still the largest in the world and accounted for $390 billion of global value added in high-tech manufacturing in 2010, U.S. share of this world market has been declining, from 34 percent in 1998 to 28 percent in 2010, as other countries made big strides ahead into this market segment.<br />Jobs are another huge concern. The great spike in unemployment over the past five years was disproportionately due to loss of manufacturing jobs. And as the economy revived, such jobs were very slow to return. In fact it is clear that many of them never will.</p></blockquote>
<p>It makes clear how far hollowing out has gone in the manufacturing sector, and how the economy has lost so many components critical to innovation that it isn’t clear how to restore them. The researchers went beyond the venture capital darlings to find what it called “Main Street Manufacturers.” It found they were at a serious disadvantage due to the lack of firms with complimentary know-how in their ecosystem. After quoting the experience of one firm, the authors noted:</p>

<p>Posted by <strong>cactus</strong> | 12/04/2007 </p>
<p><a href="http://publicagenda.org/">Public Agenda</a> is asking bloggers to contribute to a discussion on <a href="http://www.facingup.org/">the National Debt they call Facing Up</a>. These are my thoughts on the subject&#8230;<br />    <br />The White House’s Office of Management and Budget <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/hist.html">Table 7.1</a> shows data on the National Debt going back to 1940. There’s gross debt, debt held by the public, debt held by Federal Government Accounts, and debt held by the Federal Reserve. And the data is provided in dollars and as a percentage of GDP. The size of the debt looks different depending on which measure one chooses.<br />    <br />So what is the most useful way to look at the size of debt? Well, on the one hand, you don’t want to count money owed from one branch of the Federal government to another, so debt held by the public makes more sense than gross debt. Furthermore, if the average person borrowed $1 million, they’d have some trouble paying it back, whereas Bill Gates would have no such issues. Therefore, debt as a percentage of income makes more sense than debt in dollars.<br />  <br /><a name="more"></a>   <br />With all that said, here’s what Debt held by the Public as a percentage of GDP looks like, going back to 1940:    <br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTl704KiI/AAAAAAAAA5I/foHks_jZkac/s1600-h/cactus+on+debt,+figure+1,+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+line+graph.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTl704KiI/AAAAAAAAA5I/foHks_jZkac/s320/cactus+on+debt,+figure+1,+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+line+graph.jpg"></a>    </p>
<p> The graph indicates that debt exploded with the start of World War 2 – by 1946, the debt, at 109% of GDP, was almost two and a half times greater than it was in 1940. Presumably, a country fighting for its collective life could be excused in taking such a financial gamble.<br />     <br />After World War 2, the debt declined until 1974, bottoming out at just under 24% of GDP. Since then, its generally risen… quickly in some years, not so quickly in others. What’s the cause of this? No doubt there are many, but one cause is obvious, when you play with the data a wee bit. The graph below shows the Debt held by the Public as a percentage of GDP in the last full year of each Presidential administration, color coded by Political Party, following the end of World War 2:<br />    <br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTcr04KhI/AAAAAAAAA5A/eiYG-8gNNVY/s1600-h/cactus+on+debt,+figure+2,+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+bar+graph.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTcr04KhI/AAAAAAAAA5A/eiYG-8gNNVY/s320/cactus+on+debt,+figure+2,+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+bar+graph.jpg"></a>    </p>
<p> And here is a slightly different look – the next graph shows the annualized percentage change in the Debt held by the Public as a percentage of GDP from the end of one administration to the end of the next:<br />    <br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTKr04KgI/AAAAAAAAA44/D5-YoS6fUfQ/s1600-h/cactus+on+debt,+figure+3,+annualized+change+in+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+bar+graph.jpg"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R1VTKr04KgI/AAAAAAAAA44/D5-YoS6fUfQ/s320/cactus+on+debt,+figure+3,+annualized+change+in+debt+as+a+percentage+of+GDP,+bar+graph.jpg"></a>    <br />Note… a negative decrease in the debt is, obviously, an increase in the debt.    </p>
<p> The last five Democratic Presidents, Clinton, Carter, LBJ, JFK, and Truman all reduced the debt, and one has to go back sixty years to find a Democratic President who, facing the Great Depression and World War 2, allowed the debt to increase. On the other hand, the last four Republican Presidents, GW Bush, GHW Bush, Reagan, and Ford all oversaw an increase in the country’s indebtedness. It has been more than thirty years since a Republican President left office (albeit in a scandal) having reduced the National Debt. In the last few decades, somewhere along the way, the Republican Party has become the Party of fiscal irresponsibility.<br />    <br />It doesn’t have to be that way. Lord knows I’m no Republican, and it seems to me that many of what currently seem to be core Republican policies appear almost designed to increase the debt. Even so, there’s still something in the Republican DNA that believes fiscal responsibility is a good thing. All else being equal, Republican voters appear to prefer a lower debt over a higher one, and they seem to believe (even if that belief is mistaken) that they are more likely to get it from Republican politicians. President Bush himself, in the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">Economic Blueprint for his Presidency</a>, promised to retire “an historic $2 trillion in debt over… 10 years.” His debt-fighting plan was so ambitious that he expected annual surpluses to “outstrip the amount of maturing debt starting in 2007.”<br />    <br />But as he said elsewhere in his <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">Economic Blueprint</a>, <br />
<blockquote>Government must be results-oriented—guided not by process, but by performance. There comes a time when programs must be judged by how well they achieve their purpose. Where we find success, we should reward it, and make it the standard. Government action that fails in its purpose must be reformed or ended.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its time to apply that standard to the policies that Republican politicians promise us will reduce the debt.</p>
