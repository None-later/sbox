                                <p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2013/03/the-spin-on-tires.html">Peter Dorman</a> at <i>Econospeak</i> writes a gem of a post asking readers to ask simple questions when offered a morality tale by journalists, or an implied cause and effect tale, and how it takes no special skill to ask simple business questions that the journalist should at least ask, even if not o tanswer all of them.</p>
<p>Peter Dorman writes:</p>
<p>The Spin on Tires</p>
<p>It would be nice to have economic literacy in journalism.  Take <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/17/world/europe/fates-of-2-factories-show-social-schisms-in-france.html?ref=todayspaper&#038;pagewanted=print">this morning’s story</a> in the <i>New York Times </i>about a pair of tire factories in Amiens.  One is managed by Dunlop; its workers agreed to a schedule of constantly shifting workweeks and shift work, and it is still operating.  The other is managed by Goodyear.  There the workers rejected the disruptive schedule, and the factory is shutting down.  The comparison is presented as a morality tale, where the responsible workers, recognizing the new demands of productivity and competitiveness in a globalized economy, did the right thing, while their obstinate counterparts, representative of all that’s wrong with France, preferred heroic self-annihilation. </p>
<p>Reading the article, I couldn’t help but think that this analysis of The Real Reason the French Economy is Sputtering was there all along, looking for a story to attach itself to. </p>
<p>But an economist might ask a few simple questions.  First, what is the elasticity of the total production cost of a tire with respect to the changes in work hours?  I realize the reporter wants to emphasize the symbolism, the importance of workers bending to the employer’s will as a virtue in and of itself, but perhaps there is a factual dimension worth looking into.  Just a suggestion.  </p>
<p>Second, what is the market for these tires?  In particular, who if anyone will pick up the market share being abandoned by Goodyear?  Is this about outsourcing of a portion of tire production to lower-cost producers in developing countries?  Or is it about a shrinking domestic market that no longer needs the output of both plants?  Or some combination of the two or something else? </p>
<p>In particular, it is interesting that both factories, despite their different nameplates, are owned by the same company, Goodyear Dunlop.  Thus, this story describes a consolidation.  The very least an enterprising journalist can do is to inquire into the company’s overall capacity.  Is it cutting back elsewhere in Europe?  Are they shifting production geographically?  Is it possible that they might want only one operation in Amiens in any case, and that the only result of the contest over worker concessions is which plant it will be? </p>
<p>All of this is speculative, because I don’t know the tire market in France.  That’s what I would want to learn from a newspaper story, a rather long one at that, on the subject.  This might also help me understand why the US, where few workers are unionized and none have the will or ability to resist whatever schedule is dictated to them, is not blanketed in tire factories.    </p>
<p>Incidentally, there has been a ton of research in the past decade documenting the health effects of exactly the sort of work schedule being imposed at Dunlop.  It is associated with significantly elevated levels of a wide range of diseases; arguably it represents the single greatest occupational safety and health threat experienced in developed countries.  An informed journalist might want to weave that into the story too.</p>

<blockquote><p>After Obama’s reelection, former adviser David Axelrod recalls that “one of the first calls I got was, ‘Who are the young geniuses? We want to find out if we can hire thwe”<br />[skip]<br />it’s the tech and digital specialists who’ve become the unexpected darlings of data-driven corporate America. “We saw the success and the importance of social and digital and wondered if we could apply the same types of principles to people who wanted to advocate on behalf of Ford,” says Scott Monty, global head of social media for the automaker.<br />[skip]<br />“It really doesn’t matter whether you’re running a political campaign or a marketing campaign — a campaign’s a campaign,” Monty says.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<div>My first reaction to the article was schadenfreude.  I am delighted that self described genius manager Mitt Romney came a distant second as the candidate whose campaign impressed people who don&#8217;t profit when the firms they control go bankrupt.  </div>
<div>But then a thought ruined my fun.  One very important change due to the Obama campaigns is that he found a way to raise huge amounts of money from ordinary people.  I naively thought that this could weaken the hold of large firms and extremely rich individuals on politics.  </div>
<div>Ah but capitalism is flexible.  That&#8217;s one of its main advantages over other approaches to organizing society.  </div>
<div>I am pleased that the hard working dedicated people who helped save the country from Romney are doing very well indeed.  However, I fear that after four or eight years of doing very well indeed helping firms with marketing campaigns some well end up like Penn and Schoen &#8212; Democratic consultants who always argue that the way for Democrats to win elections is to do what pleases their other clients.</div>
<div>The Obama campaigns have been extremely disruptive, but I&#8217;d guess that a system which as adapted to oil shocks and financial crises will be able to deal with the disruption.  I guess that they will keep on producing goods and services efficiently and will keep more power than they should have in a Democracy.  </div>

<p>Robert writes:</p>
<p>I was reasonably sure that the latest Ruth Marcus column would cause me to have to  revise and update my earlier post declaring her a heroine of <em>Ballance</em>.   She comments on the fact  that Republican representatives live-tweeted snark during the question and answer session with Republican representatives (which was closed to the public because they looked like fools) when it was on TV ((until Fox News cut away to something else, which tells you all you need to know)). </p>
<p>It is very hard to draw ballanced conclusions from a discussion of such an event.  To my amazement Marcus managed.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ruth-marcus-obama-has-to-be-dealmaker-in-chief/2013/03/14/9714cff4-8cce-11e2-b63f-f53fb9f2fcb4_story.html?hpid=z2">This column</a> has it all. 1) Bipartisanthink, 2) the cult of the Presidency, 3) a dumb metaphor, 4) recognition that the conclusion is false part way through 5) disrespect for public opinion   6) above all, love of a grand bargain.   </p>
<p>1) &#8220;But failure would not only tarnish Republicans; it would also stain Obama’s legacy. &#8221;    </p>
<p>2) &#8220;Great presidential leadership entails figuring out how to deal with even those who do not like you.&#8221;    <br />(note that Ruth Marcus has just asserted that Lincoln wasn&#8217;t a great President).    </p>
<p>3) &#8220;The president portrayed himself as a sort of maitre d’ for budget negotiations, setting the table for others to forge an agreement. &#8221;    </p>
<p>4) &#8220;It’s true that there are times when presidential intervention in delicate congressional negotiations can be counterproductive. It’s certainly true that there are times when congressional Democrats have advised the White House to butt out. &#8220;<br />    <br />&#8220;Perhaps he’s posturing; if the president is seen as coveting a deal too much, he won’t be able to get the kind he wants. Perhaps it’s simple realism; Republicans’ refusal to consider revenue raised by curtailing loopholes is unacceptable, and the president shouldn’t accept a cuts-only deal.&#8221;    </p>
<p>5) &#8220;he is the one who is going to have to sell the notion of unpopular changes — curbing Medicare spending, reducing Social Security benefits or curtailing popular tax breaks — to a nation that says it wants a balanced bargain but may balk when that bargain is translated into painful specifics.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Notice that the proper response to such a &#8220;balk&#8221; is presidential leadership not doing what the public wants.  Marcus is assuming her readers assume the public is more ignorant than it is and will be shocked to find out about the painful specifics.  But the public has spoken (to pollsters).  Huge majorities oppose cutting Medicare or Social Security to reduce the deficit.  Marcus has lost confidence in the public and a new public will have to be elected.  She just assumes that Obama must find a way to reach agreement with Republicans (which is impossible) in order to widen the tax base and cut social security and Medicare although the public supports at most one of those actions (solid majorities support higher taxes on high incomes and support reducing tax expenditures in the abstract but that doesn&#8217;t mean a majority would support say eliminating the mortgage interest deduction).   </p>
<p>It is very clear what the public wishes to be left undone.  This public view is unacceptable to Marcus, so she asserts that Obama must find some way to give the public what it doesn&#8217;t want by working with Republicans who hate him.    <br />6) &#8220;the president sounded distinctly pessimistic about the prospects for such a bargain and disturbingly unconcerned about failing to reach one. That, he said, would be more missed opportunity than “crisis.”&#8221;  <br />heh indeed.  So Marcus is disturbed by the claim that a failure to reach a grand bargain wouldnìt be a crisis. Does this mean she thinks it would be a crisis ?  She doesn&#8217;t say.  The fact that no level of conern about the risk of failint to reach one is eccessive is too obvious for there to be any need for Marcus to argue the point.</p>
<p>The math, by the way, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/13/our-deficits-arent-as-bad-as-washington-thinks/">does not demand it.</a></p>

<p>Same-Sex Marriage In Illinois? No Basis for Objection</p>
<p>In the US today, 9 states and the District of Colombia have legalized <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-sex_marriage">same-sex marriages</a> and 9 states (counting Colorado, where the legislature passed a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_union">civil union</a> bill on March 13) have legalized some form of civil union or domestic partnership for same-sex couples. Now one of the civil union states&#8211;where same-sex couples have everything that married couples have except for the stigma of not being permitted to call their union a marriage&#8211;is on the verge of recognizing the hatefulness of that stigma and enacting a same-sex marriage statute.  Illinois&#8217;s Senate has passed the legislation.  Illinois&#8217;s House executive committee has said it supports it.  and Illinois&#8217;s governor has said he will sign it.  See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_R._Stone">Geoffrey R. Stone</a>,<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/geoffrey-r-stone/same-sex-marriage-in-illi_b_2883601.html?utm_hp_ref=politics">Same-Sex Marriage in Illinois&#8211;Now is the Time,</a> Huffington Post (The Blog), Mar. 15, 2013.</p>
<p>As Stone points out, we have come a long way in a few short years, with a majority of Americans now supporting the concept of same-sex marriage.</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]e have changed as a society. We have come to understand that people around us &#8212; good, kind, decent, loving people &#8212; are themselves gays and lesbians. And with that awareness of individual gays and lesbians, the social view of homosexuals generally has gradually changed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Further, any state that has created an &#8220;in all but the name&#8221; civil union equivalent of same-sex marriage has recognized the injustice of not permitting same-sex couples to have the kind of legal, committed relationship that different-sex couples can have.  But that difference&#8211;in all but name&#8211;is not insignificant.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As Stone notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Imagine if African-Americans could enter into civil unions but not marriages. Imagine if Catholics could legally enter into civil unions but not marriages. Imagine if mixed-race couples could enter into civil unions but not marriages. The insult, the indignity, the discrimination would be apparent to all. The same is true for same-sex couples.</p></blockquote>
<p>And there really isn&#8217;t a good argument for refusing to remove this last indignity for same-sex <br />couples.  Most of the arguments against gay marriage are along the following lines&#8211;we have to uphold traditional (meaning different-sex) marriage; we want to encourage traditional marriage to encourage procreation and cprovide the &#8220;right&#8221; environment for children; we want to further the traditional &#8220;moral values&#8221; of society, etc.  These arguments don&#8217;t hold water as far as the well-being of children or the needs of society are concerned or even whether there is a relationship between refusing marriage to same-sex couples and accomplishing those goals.  They frequently amount to arguments from the religious views of those who cling to conservative religious perspectives of homosexuality as bad and same-sex marriage as prohibited by God.  Stone makes the point the following way.</p>
<p>In a nation committed to the separation of church and state, the government can never deny rights to some in order to appease the religious beliefs of others. During the civil rights struggle, for example, segregationists frequently invoked biblical authority for the separation of the races. The Rev. James E. Burks of Bayview Baptist Church in Norfolk, Virginia, for example, insisted that God had separated the races and that &#8220;when man sets aside the plain teachings&#8221; of the Bible and &#8220;disregards the boundary lines God Himself has drawn, man assumes a prerogative that belongs to God alone.&#8221; Similarly, discrimination against women was often justified by reference to &#8220;divine ordinance.&#8221; Such arguments have no place in the American constitutional system.</p>
<p>I understand and respect the strong and sincere feelings of those who think that the marriage of same-sex couples is incompatible with their religious beliefs. But they cannot legitimately or with a proper respect for the American system of law and justice attempt to impose those beliefs on those who disagree. They have every right not to marry a person of the same-sex and they have every right not to officiate at the marriage of a same-sex couple, but they have no right &#8212; no right &#8212; to attempt to prevent the government from recognizing such marriages because they offend their religious beliefs.</p>
<p>In my view, we Americans are too often afraid to address these points of religious bigotry, perhaps from a long association of religious groups with the struggle FOR civil rights and our knowledge that not all religions join in this charade (see link to article below, for example), perhaps from the long connection of religious leadership in communities with the communities&#8217; political and social leadership.  People don&#8217;t like to stand out, to fail to conform to the views of those around them, so where these fundamentalist religious views dominate, people may find it hard to go against them.  Perhaps it is also because we so often  misunderstand our own Constitutional protections&#8211;for rights to bear arms, for rights to avoid unreasonable searches, and especially for the free exercise of religion. Religious liberty protections are intended to ensure that no person is denied the right to exercise his/her religious views, so long as those religious views don&#8217;t cause real harm to others. But the Free Exercise Clause is not meant to protect religious institutions by allowing them to impose narrow dogmas on society in order that  their leaders and practitioners avoid the &#8220;offense&#8221; of others&#8217;  differing religious views. </p>
<p>Aside:  This is one reason that I think the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling in the ministerial exception is wrong, the Tax Code provisions excluding certain income of ministers from taxation is wrong, having a federal &#8220;faith-based organizations&#8221; office is wrong, as is the concept recently in the news in connection with Obamacare that Catholic institutions shouldn&#8217;t have to provide the same health care&#8211;including abortion and birth control coverage&#8211;to all its employees who want it as other entities must do. ]<br />The Free Exercise Clause protects each American as an individual to provide that person the liberty to exercise his/her faith as s/he sees it (or not).   But not to impose his/her views on others.</p>

<blockquote>One especially significant difference between the opinions of the wealthy and the population as a whole centers on deficit reduction. According to a study cited by Demos, “87 percent of affluent households believed budget deficits were a &#8216;very important&#8217; problem, the highest percentage of all listed perceived problems.” Jobs and education, which rank at or near the top of most Americans&#8217; list of priorities, were “a distant second to budget deficits among the concerns of wealthy Americans.”</p>
<p>According to an exit poll conducted after the 2012 election, 59 percent of the public rated the economy as the country&#8217;s number one problem, while only 15 percent cited the federal budget deficit. But as the Demos report notes, “the affluent [not only] participate more in civic life; they also have greater influence over public policy.” </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Reader rjs has a link filled write up on the budget proposals coming out last week with a note on the economic thoughts on the matter:</p>
<p>There was <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/03/david-dayen-the-budgetausteritycatfood-moebius-strip.html">quite a bit of unwarranted buzz around the blogosphere about a number of budget plans</a> that were introduced early this week, all of which were <a href="http://marketwatch666.blogspot.com/2013/01/notes-on-debt-ceiling-shenanigans.html">likely an outgrowth of the requirements imposed on both houses of Congress by the debt-ceiling postponement, that budget resolutions be passed by mid April or the member&#8217;s pay would be suspended</a>; two primary proposals were put on the table by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/14/wonkbook-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-senate-democrats-budget/">Patty Murray, chair of the Senate Budget Committee, for the Democrats</a>, and <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323826704578353902612840488?mg=reno64-wsj.html?dsk=y&#038;dsk=y">by Paul Ryan, republican chair of the similar committee in the House, as the template for the Republican plan</a>; there was also<a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/03/14/back_to_work_budget_congressional_progressive_caucus_unveils_left_wing_budget.html"> a budget proposal by the progressive caucus</a> entitled <a href="http://cpc.grijalva.house.gov/uploads/Back%20to%20Work%20Budget%20-%20Executive%20Summary.pdf">The Back to Work Budget </a>(pdf)… <br />…<br />but having this plan, which suggests <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/03/douglas-holtz-eakin-balancing-budget-is.html">that we should balance the federal budget, around all week did bring to the fore what seems to be a widespread misunderstanding about our fiscal situation</a>&#8230;<br />as long as the US continues to run trade deficits, <strong>i</strong><a href="http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5048766&#038;postID=7545251603981641992&#038;isPopup=true"><strong>t is impossible for the federal government to balance its budget while the private sector is deleveraging</strong></a>&#8230;every dollar of private sector surplus is always offset by a government sector deficit, and vice versa; its an accounting identity&#8230;therefore reducing government deficits will of necessity reduce private sector surpluses accordingly&#8230;</p>
<p>This can best be seen on <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/goldmans-jan-hatzius-on-sectoral-balances-2012-12">the adjacent chart from Goldman&#8217;s chief economist Jan Hatzius</a>&#8230;what you see here is that the financial balance of three sectors (private, government, and foreign) always and must net out to zero; because one sector’s income is always another sector’s spending&#8230;thus <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/goldmans-jan-hatzius-on-sectoral-balances-2012-12">the only time the Federal budget can come close to balance is when the private sector is going into debt in a substantial way</a>, such as we saw during the boom years early last decade&#8230;most other times, government borrowing, issuing notes bills and bonds, is just the Treasury&#8217;s equivalent of monetary expansion, creating the money needed for the economy to grow&#8230;and any attempt to reduce government deficits risks inducing a worse recession&#8230;</p>

<blockquote><p>The Cyclically Adjusted Budget Balance: Shrinking Rapidly</p>
<p>The CBO has just released estimates of the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43999">cyclically adjusted budget balance</a> (or, specifically, the budget balance without automatic stabilizers). The cyclically adjusted budget balance is a better measure of the fiscal stance. The evolution of this series is interesting.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Michael Linden from <i>Center for American Progress</i> addresses one aspect of using CBO projections, especially the June 2012 report.  Best to walk it through with him based on the June report and subsequent reports&#8230;good for several posts more is how the current situation is still improving on the debt to GDP ratio so much talked about( and remind people to keep in mind the differences between federal deficit and public debt).  Based on going over there to read the walk through, I will post his conclusions only:</p>
<p><a blank="" href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/budget/news/2013/03/11/56048/the-united-states-long-term-debt-problem-isnt-as-bad-as-you-thought/" target="">The United States long term debt problem</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Does this mean our long-term debt problem is solved? No, it doesn&#8217;t. Debt at 97 percent of GDP is still a serious challenge. But it’s a much more manageable and less intractable challenge than if the debt was actually on track to hit nearly 200 percent of GDP. With only a little additional deficit reduction, we can stabilize the long-term debt-to-GDP ratio at a reasonable level. Implementing an average of about 0.5 percent of GDP in additional annual programmatic spending cuts or tax increases—or some combination of the two—would keep the debt level essentially stable for the next 25 years, reducing it to about 71 percent of GDP in 2037. This 0.5 percent of GDP would amount to about $1 trillion saved over the next 10 years.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The conventional wisdom in Washington is that we have a huge long-term debt problem. But we rarely recognize that much of the expected run up in debt is derived not from out-of-control entitlement spending but rather from the assumption that future Congresses will make our budget challenges much worse by enacting new tax cuts and new spending increases without paying for them. Take that assumption away, add in the deficit reduction we’ve already enacted, and factor in the recent slowdown in the growth of health care costs, and the debt projection falls by more than 100 percentage points of GDP. That doesn&#8217;t mean the long-term budget picture is suddenly rosy, but it does mean that we may not need to hyperventilate quite so much.</p></blockquote>

<p>This week came news that Rob Portman, a Republican senator from Ohio, is bucking his party and reversing his own long-held position on gay marriage. Now that his son has come out as gay, he supports it. From an article in the <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2013/03/sen_rob_portman_comes_out_in_f.html">Cleveland Plain Dealer by reporter Sabrina Eaton</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republican U.S. Sen. Rob Portman on Thursday announced he has reversed his longtime opposition to same-sex marriage after reconsidering the issue because his 21-year-old son, Will, is gay. </p>
<p>Portman said his son, a junior at Yale University, told him and his wife, Jane, that he&#8217;s gay and &#8220;it was not a choice, it was who he is and that he had been that way since he could remember.&#8221; </p>
<p>&#8220;It allowed me to think of this issue from a new perspective, and that&#8217;s of a Dad who loves his son a lot and wants him to have the same opportunities that his brother and sister would have &#8212; to have a relationship like Jane and I have had for over 26 years,&#8221; Portman told reporters in an interview at his office. </p>
<p>The conversation the Portmans had with their son two years ago led to him to evolve on the issue after he consulted clergy members, friends including former Vice President Dick Cheney, and the Bible.</p></blockquote>
<p>I personally favor the concept of allowing any rational consenting adults to get married, though I doubt it would  personally affect any of my closest acquaintances. (I am still waiting for someone to explain how the wedding of two people of the same gender diminishes my own marriage to my wife, or what business it is of mine who someone else wants to marry.) That said, some random thoughts:</p>
<p>1. Portman&#8217;s new views seem to be a case of him caring for his own but not for others. After all, he could have given the issue thought at any time and reached the same conclusion. He just had to muster up compassion for other people the way he did for his son, but that, apparently, was outside his capability. One wonders what other positions he holds that he might reverse himself on were it to affect a family member and what other convictions he holds would be abandoned for self-gain. If he discovers one of his other children enjoys forging other people&#8217;s signatures on checks, can we expect the senator to abandon his long-held beliefs on certain types of fraud or theft? If that sounds like an extreme example, bear in mind that Portman co-sponsored a bill banning same-sex marriage, and did what he could to make it harder for same-gender couples to adopt children. This was not a lightly held belief. Can we know which of his other core convictions are up for grabs for private gain? Can we know which aren&#8217;t?</p>
<p>2. The article indicates he consulted with Dick Cheney, who famously supported gay marriage after one of his daughters was revealed to be gay. But Dick Cheney is also an example of someone who will abandon his stated convictions. During his various terms in different government offices, both pre and post his private sector stints, Cheney did what he could to prevent Americans from having dealings with Iran. Of course, Cheney made exceptions when it would benefit himself or his friends. GOP congressman Warren Rudman <a href="https://www.blogger.com/%3Ca%20href=" irancontraaffair_key_figures="irancontraaffair_dick_cheney&#038;timeline=irancontraaffair" timeline.jsp="" www.historycommons.org="">noted of the Iran Contra hearings</a>:</p>
<p>“It was obvious that Dick Cheney and others were more interested in protecting the president than in finding out what had happened.” Later, Halliburton, while led by Dick Cheney, did business directly with Iran. Essentially, Cheney&#8217;s behavior shows us that as far as he is concerned, putting the screws on Iran is an endeavor that was and is worth the cost, provided the costs are not paid by Cheney or his friends.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much else to say about this, except that, despite the fact that Portman has now come out supporting a position I have long held, I trust him to do the right thing less now than I did before.</p>
