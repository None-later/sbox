<p>Well, Greg Sargent tries to perpetuate <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/15/debt-ceiling-endgame-comes-into-view/">the Myth of Moderate (but of course Unnamed) Republican Senators</a>.  Stan Collender <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2698/sequester-and-shutdown-could-be-more-likely-fight-over-debt-ceiling">gets punked</a>.  Nothing new on the first, but <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/2697/heres-why-republican-talk-about-default-and-shutdown-not-empty-threat">Collender’s previous piece</a> about the realities of the Ancestral Party gives the lie to Sargent’s delusion.  Economics version: the Republican Party is at a stable equilibrium. And has been there or near it for at least sixteen years, which is probably two-thirds of Greg S’s life.  You might think he would notice.</p>
<p>The NRA—most recently seen attacking the President for being President, and before that discussing decade-old video games—<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2013/01/16/opinion/ferguson-nra-video-games/index.html">released a video game</a> so that four-year-olds can get practice using AR-15s to kill people.  I suspect McMegan and her literacy-impaired cohort, Jeffrey Goldberg, are lamenting that the kids are not being taught to be cannon fodder, but will wait for <a href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/">Susan of Texas</a> (whose current marvelous <a href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-latest-moral-crusade-of-andrew.html">takedown of Publicity Whore Andrew Sullivan</a> is required reading for everyone <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/01/andrew-sullivan-and-his-daily-dish-go-the-full-utopian.html">fooled into paying money to support his ego</a>) to provide details.</p>
<p>And Brad DeLong’s Better Half put up <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/01/ann-marie-marciarille-up-in-smoke-obamacares-tobacco-surcharge.html">a post on tobacco surcharges</a> that keeps me from having to figure out the latest AAA insurance policy offering.  If I were a marketing executive at a Life Insurance firm right now, I would be heavily advertising 20-year Term Life policies to 25 to 30-year-old smokers.</p>
<p>Oh, and Notre Dame football has another scandal surrounding it. Scott Lemieux says <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2013/01/the-real-notre-dame-scandal">what needs to be said</a>.  Apparently, “Catholics versus Convicts” is only a matter of who owned the police and the judges.</p>
<p>Probably a good two days not to have gotten out of bed.</p>

                                <p>Reader mmcosker sends this e-mail pointing to <i>Why Social Security Can’t go Bankrupt: Rerun</i> at Forbe&#8217;s Magazine:</p>
<p>John T. Harvey&#8217;s Pragmatic Economics column at Forbes is one of the best. He is a Professor of Economics at Texas Christian University, and has a knack for breaking down politically charged &#8220;third rail&#8221; economic topics into terms that most anyone can understand. Below is just such a topic that deals with the myth that Social Security is broke &#8211; or even broken. Not entirely sure how widely read John is, as this article has 910 views.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why Social Security Can’t go Bankrupt: Rerun&#8221;</p>
<p><i>It is a logical impossibility for Social Security to go bankrupt. We can voluntarily choose to suspend or eliminate the program, but it could never fail because it “ran out of money.” This belief is the result of a common error: conceptualizing Social Security from the micro (individual) rather than the macro (economy-wide) perspective. It’s not a pension fund into which you put your money when you are young and from which you draw when you are old. It’s an immediate transfer from workers today to retirees today. That’s what it has always been and that’s what it has to be–there is no other possible way for it to work.</i></p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but when I recently updated this chart I was pleasantly surprised by how much the deficit had improved.  In the third quarter of 2012 &#8211;the last quarter of the previous fiscal year &#8212; the deficit had already fallen to 7.0% of GDP as compared to the peak of 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009.  </p>
<p>Moreover, with the ending of the tax break on payroll taxes and higher taxes on the top incomes as well as  prospects for improved growth in 2013 we may be experiencing the best improvement in the deficit picture since the Clinton presidency.  Moreover, the large scale shifting of incomes back to 2012 to avoid higher taxes implies that the last quarter of 2012 could also show a big improvement. This chart clearly shows why all the deficit hawks are keeping quiet on what is actually happening to the deficit</p>

<p>The Federal Reserve keeps transcripts of its meetings to set monetary policy, and releases them with a five year delay. It does not announce in advance when they will be released, but if the past is a guide, any day now we will be getting full transcripts of the 2007 meetings of the Federal Open Market Committee. Transcripts of all eight regularly scheduled meetings, plus three special emergency sessions to respond to the earliest ripples of the financial crisis, will be posted to the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/">Federal Reserve’s Web site</a>.  (The FOMC had a big year in 2007!

<blockquote><p>The U.S. trade deficit with China may be much smaller than thought according to new trade measurements that capture the flow of raw materials and intermediate goods as they work their way around the world into final products.</p>
<p>In a significant revision to economic record keeping the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the World Trade Organization have patched together international databases that show not just the value of final goods trading hands between countries – the traditional method of measuring imports and exports.</p>
<p>Rather, they have tried to unpack each step that a good takes through what has become an increasingly fragmented global system – with raw materials from one country becoming steel in another, becoming a car part in a third, becoming a finished auto in a fourth that is then exported to a fifth.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>In releasing the study, the WTO and OECD highlighted how the data could influence the world trade agenda. They argue, for example, that the impact of tariffs around the world can’t be fully understood without looking at value chains, since a final product may include import duties from several different stops.</p>
<p>Officials from the WTO and OECD plan to discuss their findings at a press conference on Wednesday. </p></blockquote>

<p>Paul Krugman appeared on <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/bill_moyers">Bill Moyers</a> PBS program Sunday night, talking sanely and rationally about the economy and why jobs (should) come first&#8211;and along the way noting how politics now dominates what and how we can talk about economic policies.  See Moyers &#038; Company, <a href="http://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-paul-krugman-on-why-jobs-come-first/">Paul Krugman on Why Jobs Come First</a> (Jan. 11, 2013).  </p>
<p>(While you are at the site, also watch Moyers&#8217; essay, <a href="http://billmoyers.com/segment/bill-moyers-essay-the-crony-capitalist-blowout/">The Crony Capitalist Blowout</a>, about the goodies that corporations got out of the fiscal cliff deal, which included everything from immediate expensing to the active financing exception and the R&#038;D credit&#8211;all subsidies for big corporations that spent lots of lobbying power ensuring they would get them).</p>
<p>We have all kinds of reasons to know that the US is not Greece and will not be like Greece&#8211;we are a powerful economy, we have our own currency, and our debt is widely respected.  Nonetheless, the right-wing radicals want to destroy the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal">New  Deal</a> programs&#8211;Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and they are willing to take the entire economy hostage to try to get their way.  Just look at Pat Toomey in the clip Moyers shows on the show, threatening to put the US government into default unless the majority in Congress accedes to the will of the wacky minority.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>That wacky minority hopes to use brinksmanship games around the debt ceiling to force progressives to yield on their dream target&#8211;decimating the New Deal. </p>
<p>The radicals on the right don&#8217;t really care about the debt ceiling&#8211;look at the way they willingly raised it throughout the Bush administration, even while viciously cutting taxes for the wealthy and creating huge deficits out of the surplus existing when Bush took office!  They don&#8217;t really care about deficits.  Look at the way they viciously cut taxes for the wealthy and spent on military budgets and preemptive wars when Bush was in office! </p>
<p>What they want is a radical restructuring of the economy in a way that will maintain and further the new gilded age, where bankers and private equity titans get rich off the labor of ordinary folk and ordinary folk find themselves eeking out a living at more or less the same rate they were before the Bush decades.  The top 1%, as Moyers pointed out, have seen a 275% increase in incomes over the last decade (due in large part to the Bush tax cuts, but also to the misappropriation of productivity gains by the rich).  Meanwhile, average American workers have seen their wages barely increase by $1.23 an hour&#8230;..not even keeping up with inflation.</p>
<p>Obama has said he will not negotiate on the debt ceiling.  He must hold firm.  There are various ways he can combat their &#8220;leverage&#8221;.  The obvious one is that it is unconstitutional for Congress to pass laws that require spending, pass laws that raise too little revenue to pay for that spending, and then refuse to permit the government to borrow to make up the difference that they have legislated into being.  That is irresponsible, and can be viewed as a violation of their constitutional obligation to ensure that the nation can pay for the debts it has already incurred.  See Taylor, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/01/13/top_dems_urge_obama_to_weigh_unilateral_debt_hike_2/">Top Dems Urge Obama to Weigh Unilater Debt Hike</a>, Salon.com (Jan. 13, 2013).  Obama is correct when he highlights this.  And surely as President, his power reaches to borrowing to fund the government that he is obligated by Congress to run under the laws he is obligated to implement.  He should make it clear that he is willing to risk impeachment to test that power rather than be held hostage by their petty, selfish games.</p>
<p>What about the &#8220;trillion dollar platinum coin&#8221; idea?  This is the law that grants the executive the right to mint platinum coins of any denomination.  Why not mint a few that add up to a trillion, and then pay it to the Fed and draw cash from the Fed based on that coin, to pay our bills?  That is perfectly legal&#8211;Congress did not limit the use of the coins in the legislation authorizing them.  If Congress can play brinksmanship games by threatening to put the US in default and destroy our economy unless the majority enacts the pet legislation of the minority to destroy the Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare safety net programs, then the Executive should be willing to use every tool at his disposal to prevent that.  Of course, Treasury today said it wouldn&#8217;t do that.  See Anne Lowrey, Treasury <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/us/politics/treasury-will-not-mint-1-trillion-coin-to-raise-debt-ceiling.html">Won&#8217;t Mint Coin to Defy Debt Ceiling</a>, New York Times (Jan. 12, 2013).   Stupid of them to do so, since it is clearly within the law.  Obama cannot &#8220;wimp out&#8221; on this debt ceiling issue (to use Krugman&#8217;s term):  if he lets the  zanies in the GOP use these tactics to force changes in the safety net programs, he will have destroyed the Democratic party and the recovery from the Grand Recession in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Remember, the analogy of US government debt to household debt is a silly one, just as is the analogy to Greece.  The government is not a family; our income is not the fixed wages of a head of household; our debt may feel staggeringly large for ordinary people to comprehend, but it is not too large a share of our GDP and our cost-of-funds right now is incredibly low.  We should borrow while the borrowing is good, to pay for the vital infrastructure repairs that need to be made and to ensure that we do not default on a key obligation to our people&#8211;the provision of a decent standard of living through measures that encourage job creation (by creating demand) and provide security against job loss and the vulnerabilities of old age and sickness.</p>
<p>The <i>Peterson Institute</i> is spending half a billion dollars to distort the public&#8217;s understanding of debt and deficits, in order to convince Americans that we should run the government like they run their households, in terms of amount of debt.  But Peterson is a right-wing billionaire whose views are antiquated and wrong for the time.  Keynes is the only one who has had it right, and we should listen to Keynes, not Friedman&#8217;s brute capitalism theories of a &#8220;free&#8221; market in which the wealthy control the assets and confiscate the rewards, not Peterson&#8217;s cacophonous sounds about debt. </p>
<p>Look again at Moyers&#8217; program.  He runs a tape where Lloyd Blankfein&#8211;head of Goldman Sachs, filthy rich, and one of the culprits of the financialization of the economy and the speculation that threw us into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_recession">Great Recession</a>&#8211;talks about how ordinary people will have to give up on their expectations from Social Security and Medicare.  Entitlements, he says, just can&#8217;t deliver what people want&#8211;we can&#8217;t afford it.  This from a guy who has socked away millions garnered from the everyday lives of ordinary people.  This from a person who has ridden the easy street rail line of subsidized profits for his banking firm (cost-of-funds extraordinarily low due to the government bailout; and subsidies in the code both internationally (active financing exception) and at home (the tax treatment of derivatives has been extraordinarily kind to banks in terms of sourcing and therefore taxability), etc.  This from a person who has enjoyed a priviledged preferential rate of taxation on much of his income, lobbied for through the revolving door of Treasury officials and banksters and their attorneys.</p>
<p>No, Obama shouldn&#8217;t listen to the Blankfeins of the world, or the Norquists, or the Toomeys.  He should turn a deaf ear to Mitch McConnell and to Rand Paul and all of those who insist that we have to keep funding the military-industrial oligarchy but that we can&#8217;t afford to keep funding the earned benefit programs that have made the difference between an intolerable standard of living and a decent standard of living for millions of Americans.</p>

<div dir="ltr">Today, in another step forward, the National Review <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/337681/averting-default-achieving-restraint-editors?pg=1#">calls on Republicans to take the threat of default off the table</a>:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Republicans should recognize that the prospect of default is the Democrats’ chief weapon in their campaign of avoidance. That prospect is not a source of Republican leverage in the debt-ceiling fight; it is the primary source of the Democrats’ leverage. It is a way to distract the press and the public from the reality of our fiscal crisis.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The Democrats’ strategy offers Republicans an opportunity. Since the Democrats insist that the prospect of default is the reason they will not negotiate about spending restraint, Republicans should begin the debt-ceiling fight by permanently eliminating that prospect, turning the debt-ceiling debate into an argument about future spending rather than past borrowing.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The House should pass a bill to redefine the debt limit so that it constrains primary spending but not debt service. Under this reform, a Treasury that had hit the statutory borrowing limit could continue to borrow what it needed exclusively for paying interest on the national debt and to roll over existing debt obligations, but it could not borrow for any other government spending until the limit had been increased. This would take default entirely off the table.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The policy suggestion here is a bit puzzling: As one Dem joked to me, is the idea that the GOP will only continue to threaten to prevent Congress from paying out things like Social Security and veterans’ benefits, but not interest payments? That aside, the core point here is that National Review is admitting that the threat of default gives the leverage not to Republicans, but to Democrats.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/15/the-morning-plum-conservatives-surrendering-in-debt-ceiling-fight/">The Morning Plum: Conservatives surrendering in debt ceiling fight?</a>, Greg Sargent, Washington Post, this morning</div>
<p>Ah. It’s official: The National Review’s editors do not depend on Social Security and Medicare to survive or keep them from bankruptcy.  Nor do they have an elderly parent in a nursing home who, since exhausting his or her financial reserves, remain cared for there by dint of Medicaid. Which is nice for them.</p>
<p>And most of them live in the Northeast, not in Arizona, California, New Mexico, or Texas, so, much as they hate illegal immigration from Mexico, it doesn’t really impact their lives.  Their homes, unlike the Arizona ranchers who elect the state legislators who enact harsh anti-illegal-immigrant laws, their own property, including their winter homes, are probably secured by private guards.</p>
<p>But they probably do fly.  Maybe in their employer’s or their friends’ corporate jets rather than in commercial airliners.  But fly, nonetheless.  They also probably eat produce, poultry, meat and dairy products inspected by&#8211;OMG&#8211;a federal agency; specifically, the Department of Agriculture.  </p>
<p>So it didn’t occur to them that, by publishing that editorial in which they acknowledge that the Republicans are losing the PR fight on the debt ceiling, and in which they advised the Republicans nonetheless to issue a revised ransom note removing only bond interest payments and already-incurred contractual debts as hostages and leaving the rest with guns to their heads&#8211;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-president-congeniality-talks-tough/2013/01/14/6f5b50a0-5e9d-11e2-90a0-73c8343c6d61_print.html">sorry, Dana Milbank</a>, but that analogy is appropriate even after Sandy Hook, and is utterly irrelevant to Sandy Hook (what a weird claim by Milbank in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">a thoroughly off-kilter op-ed</a>)&#8211;they’re effectively urging the Repubs to commit political suicide.</p>
<p>I say, go for it, Repubs!  Go for it. </p>

                                <p>Okay.  There’s no way to do justice to Washington Post centerist columnist Dana Milbank’s column today about Obama’s “presser” yesterday by just summarizing it or quoting a sentence or short paragraph from it.  And justice for that column, titled “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-president-congeniality-talks-tough/2013/01/14/6f5b50a0-5e9d-11e2-90a0-73c8343c6d61_print.html">President Congeniality talks tough</a>,” is what I want.  So here are the first six (blessedly short) paragraphs of it:
<div dir="ltr">“I’m a pretty friendly guy,” President Obama said near the end of his White House news conference Monday afternoon.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The claim might have been a touch more plausible if he hadn’t spent the bulk of the previous hour demonstrating just how adversarial he could be. Indeed, there was no precipitating event that led him to schedule the last-minute session in the East Room — lending credibility to the theory that he summoned reporters so he could bait Republicans.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“If congressional Republicans refuse to pay America’s bills on time, Social Security checks and veterans benefits will be delayed,” the friendly president said, explaining his refusal to negotiate over increasing the debt limit.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Calling the opposition’s stance “absurd,” Obama advised Republicans that they “have two choices here: They can act responsibly and pay America’s bills, or they can act irresponsibly and put America through another economic crisis. But they will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy. . . . And they better choose quickly, because time is running short.”</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">And that was just the opening statement. The hectoring continued through the Q&#038;A. Exactly one month after the massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., Obama said of debt-reduction talks: “What I will not do is to have that negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people.”</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">The Republicans’ view, President Congeniality added, “was rejected by the American people when it was debated during the presidential campaign. . . . But if the House Republicans disagree with that and they want to shut down the government to see if they can get their way on it, that’s their prerogative.”</div>
<p>I agree completely.  The president should never summon White House reporters to the White House press room in order to hold a press conference.  Or at least not to bait Republicans.</p>
<p>And, I guess, not even to respond to Republican daily baiting of him by falsely telling the public that a quirk in the law, requiring Congress to authorize the Treasury to pay the government’s already-incurred bills and bond interest, and pay such things as salaries to military personnel, air traffic controllers, Agriculture Department food inspectors, and Homeland Security airport marshals&#8211;not to mention not-yet-but-about-to-be owed Social Security payments, Medicaid payments to nursing homes, and Medicare payments to physicians and hospitals&#8211;is instead a request by the president and the Democrats in Congress to increase spending appropriations.  </p>
<p>No, sir.  Much better to allow the Republicans to prey on the public’s misunderstanding of the phrase “raise the debt ceiling.”   </p>
<p>Pass the ransom note, Republicans. Just do it through the mainstream media, as you have been doing.  They’ll happily repeat your message, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/will-republicans-debt-ceiling-is-about.html">complete with disinformation</a>, without adding their own: a brief explanation of what the debt ceiling actually is.  Apparently, congressional reporters, unlike the White House press corp, don’t mind being summoned as bait.  Nor do the Sunday talk-show folk.  </p>
<p>Worms, all. </p>
<p>Milbank does allow that:</p>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Arguably, Obama’s no-more-Mr.-Nice-Guy approach is good politics. His first-term experience made clear that he gained nothing from Republicans when he took a passive approach. When it comes to getting things done in Washington, there’s no substitute for forceful presidential leadership. Teddy Roosevelt, whose oil-on-canvas likeness gazed at Obama from an East Room wall, probably would have approved.</div>
<p>Actually, not even just arguably, Milbank conflates statements of fact&#8211;in this instance, fact about what the debt ceiling is&#8211;with politics.  Certainly, correcting the opposition’s campaign of disinformation, and educating the public about a critical but technical statute that almost no one other than Washington pols, fiscal-policy wonks, and journalists who cover these people and subjects are familiar with, is damn good politics.  It is, in fact, absolutely necessary politics.  It’s dereliction-of-duty-for-failure-to-do-so politics.  </p>
<p>But statements of fact, and statements of policy based on the statements of fact, are not themselves mere politics.  They’re statements of fact and statements of policy based on those facts. </p>
<p>What’s most disturbing about this column is not that one high-profile political columnist confuses these things, but that he says that the entire White House press corp in attendance at the press conference yesterday does.  </p>
<p>So I suggest that they get out more.  Milbank, for example, might consider stepping out of Washington and into, maybe, Baltimore.  Not a long drive, really.  There, he could stop in at a coffee shop or mall and maybe ask people whether they had heard or read of Obama’s comments yesterday and, if so, whether they understood more now about the what debt ceiling statute is than they did a day before.</p>
<p>Then he can report his findings to the rest of the White House press corp.  And offer a different theory about the reason Obama summoned them to the press room yesterday.</p>
<p>Or he could <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/rep-greg-walden-r-or-explains-debt.html">just</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/obama-we-are-not-deadbeat-nation-but.html">start</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/see-harold-meyersons-washington-post.html">reading</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/call-this-spade-spade-deadbeat-threat.html">Angry</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/the-continued-necessity-of-explaining.html">Bear</a>.  </p>
<p>Seriously, I hope Paul Krugman and other “names” will expose Milbank’s argument for what it is. Obama has that tendency to cower whenever a media meme takes hold on fiscal-policy issues. Milbank and the White House press corp don’t read Angry Bear, but they might read Krugman’s blog. 
<div>  Nah; probably not.  It’s not like Krugman’s a centerist, or anything.  Still, it’s worth a shot, especially since what matters most is that Obama or someone close to him might.<br /> <i>This</i> Bear is <i>really</i> ANGRY today.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>UPDATED:  Well, I woke up this morning to a few congratulatory emails, including from some Bears, telling me that Paul Krugman linked to my post yesterday <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">in a blog post of his</a>.  Awesome!  (Thanks, Prof. Krugman.  And thanks to everyone for the congrats.)  </p>
<p>But I also want to republish here as an update an exchange between Bear JazzB. and me in the comments to the post:</p>
<div dir="ltr">JazzBumpa:   I always thought Milbank was more or less OK.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But this is really stupid.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Me:  Milbank was terrific back when he was the Post’s WH correspondent during the first G.W. Bush term, JazzB. But he rarely writes anything in his column that I think is really insightful or informative, and sometimes he writes a column that’s just baffling. Like yesterday’s.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">What really dismays me is that he and some of the other “name” pundits flat-out missed the purpose of Obama’s Monday press conference. Obama was explaining what the debt ceiling law actually is&#8211;and what it is not. An explanation that was (and is) necessity because it’s a law that sounds like it means something that it does not, and that means something that it does not sound like it means&#8211;a fact that the Repubs have abused nearly every time one of them says anything publicly about it.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Dave Weigel <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/barack_obama_s_last_first_term_press_conference_the_president_spoke_of_republicans.html">wrote</a> a [Politics article]* on Slate on Monday after the press conference that started out sounding like he missed the point&#8211;and then, wham!  He hit the nail on the head, pointing out that back in Sept. Obama said he planned to speak much more, directly, to the public and explain policy issues.  Weigel said that the Repubs mocked that then, but learned on Monday what he meant.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">And it does seem that the Repubs did learn a lot on Monday, because since then, several have publicly acknowledged that the debt ceiling game is over.  Yet Milbank and a few other pundits didn’t catch on.</div>
<p>And as long as I’m updating here, I’ll indulge myself and republish another exchange I had in the Comments to the post&#8211;this one with FastCommerce:</p>
<div dir="ltr">FastCommerce:  Worms. You an idiot.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Me:  Oh, dear. FastCommerce, it looks like you took the BAIT.</div>
<p>So sorry, folks.  But I couldn’t resist.</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*In my original comment, I said Weigel wrote a blog post.  Actually, what he wrote was a full-length article, not a comment or short piece on his Slate blog.  (Those of us who are longtime Slate addicts know there’s a difference.)</div>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Warning: a thought just came to me.  It might be totally wrong.  A little knowledge of the law is dangerous.
<div></div>
<div>The idea is that the Fed can buy US federal government issued securities at will so I think it could buy one random T-bill for $ 1 trillion if it chose to do so.  The national debt is calculated using the face value of the debt so this trillion wouldn&#8217;t count towards the debt limit.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Is this legal ?  Damned if I know.  I know that the Fed always purchase government issued securities on the open market, but I don&#8217;t know if it is required to do this or just chooses.  I am quite sure that it choses but is not required by law to keep it&#8217;s operations secret.  I am quite sure it could declare an intention to buy  t-bills with face value $ 1,000 and particular serial numbers for $ 1 million each.  This means their price at the initial auction would be almost $1 million, but they still would be (and be counted as being) $ 1,000 in deb to the Treasury.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now at $1,000,0000 for $1,000 in 91 days there would be a lot of people eager to sell short.  But the Fed is not required to take long positions balancing short positions (this is assumed in standard finance models).  In fact the Fed is not allowed to do this, but it&#8217;s enough that it&#8217;s not forced. </div>
<div></div>
<div>There would be 2 instruments with very different prices.  The actual paper T-bills with the special serial numbers and synthetic versions as long positions in trades between private agents.  Actual US government securities sell for a price slightly higher than synthetic Eurodollar instruments because of default risk.  They can sell for 1000 times the price.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>I think this is legal and equivalent to the Platinum coin except for one thing.  The FOMC can do this.  The Treasury just collects the money at auction.</div>
