<div dir="ltr">In the wake of the fiscal deal raising taxes only on income over $450,000, Republicans are declaring that the debate over taxes is finished. The next fiscal deal will contain nothing in new revenues. Yesterday, Mitch McConnell <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/sen-mitch-mcconnell-tax-issue-finished-151934787--abc-news-politics.html">said</a>:</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">“The tax issue is finished. Over. Completed. That’s behind us. Now the question is what are we going to do about the biggest problem confronting our country and that’s our spending addiction. We didn’t have this problem because we weren’t taxing enough.”</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">As <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/111664/mcconnell-taxes-behind-us-meet-the-press-obama-debt-ceiling-sequester-cuts">Jonathan Cohn notes this morning</a>, this talking point may have some potency: Hey, we just raised taxes on the rich, so the next bite at the apple should be focused on spending cuts, right? So it’s worth putting the GOP demand in clearer perspective. What Republicans are saying here is that they intend to use the debt ceiling as hostage to ensure that all of the deficit reduction in the coming “grand bargain” is paid for by spending cuts — such as cuts to entitlements and other social programs — with not a penny coming from new revenues via the closing of loopholes and deductions enjoyed by the rich.</div>

<p>A hallmark of the Romney campaign was its pathological tendency to make bald misrepresentations of fact and to reiterate and reiterate the misrepresentation even after almost everyone knew it was false.  Sometimes everyone knew the statement was false as soon as the statement was made; it contradicted what everyone already knew.  Other times&#8211;or at least one other time&#8211;everyone knew the statement was false after, say, the CEO of the auto company that Romney said was closing a major plant in Ohio and moving the jobs to China said in a highly-publicized statement what everyone in or near the locality of the plant already knew: that the story was false and that the plant had recently expanded and was about to increase its workforce there.  And still other times, everyone learned that the statement was false because the Obama PAC corrected the misrepresentation with TV commercials, or the news media pointed out often enough that the statement was false. </p>
<p>But those misstatements of fact didn’t concern technical matters of law or economic fact that almost no one actually knows.  Which is why the debt ceiling matter is so susceptible of misrepresentation that “raising the debt ceiling” means increasing budget appropriations, when actually it means making available enough money to pay bills already accrued from earlier budget appropriations.  This is a technical issue made in Tea Party heaven, albeit many decades before the Tea Party was born. </p>
<p>So, isn’t it paramount the president explain to the public what the debt ceiling issue actually is, rather than allowing the Republicans to keep misinforming the public that it’s an increase in budget allocations rather than a payment for budget allocations already made?  This quirk in the law&#8211;the requirement that Congress authorize payment of costs already budgeted, already promised (e.g., in bond interest, Medicare payments, Social Security payments, veterans benefits)&#8211;is something that almost no member of the general public knows.</p>
<p> Obama keeps saying, in a single sentence, that he won’t allow default on money already appropriated and owing.  That’s nice.  But does he really not understand that this goes right over most people’s heads, because the Repubs keep telling them the opposite, and because the debt ceiling law is a technicality that most people simply don’t know about, and because that technicality has no counterpart in, say, normal living experience?</p>
<p>This is beginning to seem to me like the 2009-2010 ACA debate, redux&#8211;with the rightwing misinforming the public, and Obama thinking that the public knows specifics that the public flatly does not know.</p>
<p>So here’s a suggestion: Obama’s shown a fondness for adopting the Republicans’ messaging by analogizing the federal government to a family’s finances, even though this analogy, when it involves economic stimulus and other fiscal-appropriations issues, actually amounts to a misrepresentation of fact.  But on the debt ceiling matter, the government-is-similar-to-families analogy is exactly apt.  If someone already runs up large credit card bills, he owes the money even if he decides to rip up his credit cards and stop running up personal debt.  If he doesn’t pay the credit card bills he’s accrued, he’s DEFAULTING on those debts, and his credit rating will plunge.  And if someone owes monthly mortgage payments, he can’t simply stop paying them, and expect to keep his home.  He’ll lose the home in a foreclosure proceeding.</p>
<p>See? Not hard to explain.  But if Obama can’t or won’t explain this, some other Democrat who can garner the public’s attention should.  My suggestion: Bill Clinton.  And if Clinton won’t, then maybe Joe Biden can.</p>
<p>And after this success, maybe they can begin to torpedo the Republicans’ “Greece” canard by actually providing the public with facts.  Such as that Greece has a much smaller, less comprehensive social safety-net system than the U.S., than Germany, than Holland, than Canada, than Australia, than ….  It also has a deeply embedded culture of low rates of taxes, tax payments and tax collections.  Unlike Germany, Holland, Canada, Australia ….  </p>
<p>Which might suggest that McConnell didn’t know what he’s talking about when he said we didn’t have this problem because we weren’t taxing enough.  Especially since we didn’t have this problem when, say, during the Clinton years, we were.</p>
<p>That spending addiction of ours, of course, goes by the some familiar names.  Those names include Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid (including nursing home payments for incapacitated elderly who’ve exhausted their savings), and unemployment insurance.  They also include the Defense Department, Veterans Affairs, Homeland Security, the Food and Drug Administration, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, air traffic controllers, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Centers for Disease Control, medical research grants, supplemental aid to states for education, the Federal Emergency Management Administration, the Agriculture Department (food safety), and farm price supports.  Not to mention “tax expenditures” to, say, ExxonMobil.</p>
<p>All of which the president should mention in his two big speeches this month: the inaugural speech and the State of the Union address.  Maybe then the Republicans will suggest what parts of our spending addiction they want us to confront, and how&#8211;exactly&#8211;they think we should confront them.  </p>
<p>Since, unlike Greece, we didn’t have this problem because we weren’t taxing enough. </p>

                                <p>There has been much discussion recently of the “problem” with Macroeconomics. See <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2013/01/my-simple-theory-about-why-macroeconomists-disagree.html">Nick Rowe</a>, <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/is-economics-divided-into-warring.html">Noah Smith</a> (who may have been punked by a self-selecting sample—or may not have), <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/01/bad-advice-from-experts-herding-and-bubbles.html">Mark Thoma</a>, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/01/more-on-the-current-state-of-macro.html">Brad DeLong</a>, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/thoughts-from-economics-writers-on.html">RDan’s collection here a while back</a>, and the rest of The Usual Suspects.<br />Let’s ignore for the moment that the problem with Macro is Micro.  I think I have figured out the <em>other</em> problem with Macro, and I have Victor Matheson to thank for it.</p>
<p>In the midst of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/12/dr-black-did-it-as-shorter-heres-data.html">a post last week</a>, I noted that there are perpetually claims from economists and that “chained CPI” is a “more accurate” measure of inflation. (Not coincidentally, Chained CPI runs below CPI.)  That not being enough I continued—in the calm, rational manner for which I am known (think a combination of Scipio Aemillianus and William Tecumseh Sherman)—by highlighting Professor Matheson’s otherwise rather innocuous comment chez DeLong that he remembered being told the same thing.</p>
<p>I gave Professor Matheson a “most notably,” when he was hardly the most extreme representative.  Indeed, anyone following the link to his comment would wonder why he was chosen.  It was mainly from this:<br />
<blockquote>While I teach intro to macro, I am not an expert in the minute details of the CPI calculations, and I do remember the talk in the 90s was that the CPI overestimates the true costs of inflation by something like a percentage point or two every year.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it is my misreading of that.  Note that, while Professor Matheson teaches Introduction to Macroeconomics (presumably Econ 301 or 302), he specifically <em>does not say that he teaches that CPI overestimates the true cost of inflation.</em><br /><em><br /></em> But he does say that he heard it in the 1990s, and does not say he has heard that those claims are bollocks.<br />Before going further, I want to apologize to Professor Matheson for making him the poster child and putting words into his mouth that his fingers didn’t actually type.  (And, in direct answer to his question chez DeLong, Nancy Ortiz in comments to the previous thread, lays out the biggest problems with “chained CPI” specifically as a measure for Social Security [or generally for anyone without legacy wealth].)</p>
<p>PJR, again in the previous comments thread, correctly sends us to the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/reports/boskinrpt.html">Boskin Report</a>, and is not impressed:<br />
<blockquote>I conclude that the C-CPI probably answers the wrong question, consequently measures the wrong concept, and conflates inflation with behavioral responses to inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>To I trust no one’s great surprise, I consider that a generous interpretation.  Yet the myth persists.  Which is another reason we have a problem with Macro.</p>
<p>Chemists don’t teach <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phlogiston_theory">Phlogiston Theory</a>. None of the biologists, biochemists, or biophysicists I know talks about the glories of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamarckism">Lamarckism</a> when differentiating between 3’ and 5’ DNA.  But economists still pretend, as they did a decade ago <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/01/the-end-of-economists-imperialism.html">that Gary Becker proved that economics means that discrimination does not exist</a>; that Real Business Cycle Theory can actually explain any significant portion of Business Cycles in <em>either</em> direction; that NAIRU is a workable concept, even as “skill shortages” cause it to be severely discontinuous in a world that claims to have continuous functions (and does not work if it doesn’t).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A world where CPI is a bad measure because people will choose dog food when they cannot afford Hamburger Helper (which we call “chicken-steak,” as if it were <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FctT-gzFaOw">Patrick Stewart and Steve Martin negotiating</a> [link will be understood by rjw’s students]) and that the IBM ThinkPads I bought three months ago costs about 1/10th what it did when it was new in 2001 (and I can probably sell it for&#8230;<em>bupkis</em>) means that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/04/1700-per-capita-per-year-in-consumer-surplus-from-personal-computers.html">“computing costs” have gone down for consumers</a>.</p>
<p>Not to mention a world of “rational expectations” (“micromotives,” as it were) being generalized so that networks, social interactions, cliques, and indeed governments are treated solely as if they are the sum of the parts.</p>
<p>The problem with Macro remains Micro, and the problem with my previous post remains that I was more than a bit unfair to Professor Matheson of Holy Cross, for which I apologize to him and our readers.<br />(Discussion of the paper referenced yesterday is deferred to another day.)</p>

<p>Some Thoughts on Statistical Analysis (A bit wonky)</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2013/01/assorted-links-664.html">Tyler Cowen</a>, a pretty good post on <a href="http://seanjtaylor.com/post/39573264781/the-statistics-software-signal">statistical analysis</a>.  While I suggest reading the post, I&#8217;ve reproduced the first sentence of each point the author makes below (though have cut out the pieces in betweeen):<br />
<blockquote>1. When you don’t have to code your own estimators, you<br />probably won’t understand what you’re doing&#8230;<br />2. When it’s extremely low cost to perform inference, you are likely<br />to perform a lot of inferences&#8230;<br />3. When operating software doesn’t require a lot of training, users of<br />that software are likely to be poorly trained&#8230;<br />4. When you use proprietary software, you are sending the message that<br />you don’t care about whether people can replicate your analyses or<br />verify that the code was correct.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think for the most part, this is a brilliant post, and it is worth keeping the main points in mind as they are very, very good.  That said, I tend to disagree slightly with a few points.  One is the author&#8217;s love of R, stated repeatedly in the pieces of the post I didn&#8217;t quote.    I find R to be a pain in the #$$.  So does the author, but he feels that is a virtue as per item 2 above.  Frankly, the older I get, the more I use (wait for it!) Excel to do statistical analysis.  Excel doesn&#8217;t do much in the way of sophisticated work, and what it does is clunky.  I&#8217;m guessing it would violate the author&#8217;s point 4, being proprietary, but I&#8217;ve checked enough results on Excel<br />using matrix algebra that I&#8217;m satisfied its basic regression functionality works.  If you want to do anything more sophisticated than a plain old OLS regression, you need to code it yourself in VBA.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But here&#8217;s what I love about using Excel&#8230;   Odds are, whatever data you&#8217;re using to do your analysis, you started off by sorting it in Excel in the first place. Its easy to sort and graph the data, and the eyeball and the nose are always the most important tools in statistics.  Another cool thing about Excel &#8211; it will spit out the<br />residuals.   And you can graph and organize those residuals twenty three ways from Sunday, which means you can build your own diagnostics appropriate for whatever task you&#8217;re doing.  Unless you absolutely positively have to run a system of equations fast, or you have a client who has glommed onto some absolutely useless statistical tool with a cool name (dig through an advanced econometrics book and you&#8217;ll spot &#8217;em aplenty) and you can&#8217;t shake them from their ignorance, there isn&#8217;t much point to using R or Stata or you name the program.  If your problem is not lack of time, but rather data sets that are too big for Excel to handle, find someone who is good in C++.</p>
<p>Another thing&#8230;  I suspect the author of that post and I have similar views on SAS. My own experience &#8211; I have seen or had associations with a number of organizations that consider themselves data savvy, and in<br />my opinion, from what I can tell,  if a company has X SAS licenses, it almost invariably means the organization has X junior analysts whose job it is to reach actionable conclusions using SAS who haven&#8217;t got<br />the vaguest clue how to interpret the results of the simplest statistical analysis.  This isn&#8217;t to say SAS is a bad tool, but merely that many organizations consider having a SAS license to be, in an of itself, a holy grail that allows them to dispense with any real expertise.</p>
<p>One final disagreement with the author &#8211; he seems to be falling into fallacy many economists do, which is assuming that what economists do is a science.  This to me indicates a failure to understand that a science is something scientists do, and what economists do is very different from what scientists do.   In biology, you won&#8217;t get very far if you try to peddle Lamarckian evolution, Lysenkoism or ID. Try being a proponent of the theory of phlogiston or the aether wind and see what that does for your career in physics.  But the equivalent<br />behavior in Economics won&#8217;t stop you, and may even prove beneficial to those wishing to get tenure at Harvard or Chicago, or be Dean of an Ivy League business school.  And then there are the think tanks&#8230;</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Steve Randy Waldman as usual <a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/3630.html#comment-28383">gets practical</a> about Treasury issuing platinum coins. JKH in comments there does typically likewise.</p>
<p>Suppose the Department of the Treasury says:</p>
<p>“We have a statutory obligation to pay all amounts that have been authorized by Congress — both expenditure and debt obligations. Since the borrowing limit has been reached and Congress won’t let us sell bonds to make the payments they’ve authorized, we are now issuing physical currency, in the form of platinum coins, to meet those obligations. We are required to do this by statute.”</p>
<p>Let’s say the coins are worth $1 million each.</p>
<p>Treasury would have to issue about $100 billion in coins per month, which is about what it currently issues in bonds. The coins would be effectively the same as zero-interest, perpetual bonds.</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter conceptually whether Treasury deposits that currency at their bank (the Fed) then pay bills normally using checks and wire transfers, or issues the coins to payees. Payees will deposit them at their banks, banks will deposit them in their accounts at the Fed, and the result is the same. The Fed has a bunch of platinum coins in its vault, and the government has met its obligations.</p>
<p>Ditto if Treasury sells the coins to primary dealers/banks/sovereign-wealth funds:</p>
<p>1. A transfer of Fed reserves/deposits from dealers/bankers to Treasury. Treasury has money to  spend.</p>
<p>2. Dealers/bankers deposit their coins at the Fed.</p>
<p>3. The Fed issues reserves to dealers/bankers in return.</p>
<p><strong>But:</strong> Suppose the Fed starts feeling inflation looming. So it sells bonds and receives bank deposits (reserves) in return, to sop up excess money/reserves. This is called “sterilizing” the platinum money creation. (We’ll ignore for the moment the fact that the sold bonds may/will just get repoed in the private market in return for cash.)</p>
<p>But the Fed’s only got about $3 trillion in bonds to sell. What happens when it runs out? Can it still control inflation?</p>
<p>(At that point, monetary policy is effectively managed by congress’s taxing and spending decisions. Budget deficit = easing. Budget surplus = tightening. That is not a promising prospect.)</p>
<p>The Fed could start selling its platinum coins, draining reserves/”money” out of the system. (Assuming those coins aren’t used for exchange, but are held in vaults just like other “reserves”/stores of value.)</p>
<p>But why would dealers buy them?</p>
<p>The answer seems to be negative interest on reserves (IOR). If the Fed charged .25% (or whatever) to hold banks’ money for them (negative quarter point of interest), banks/dealers/sovereign-wealth funds would have an incentive to trade those reserves for platinum coins (at 0% interest) to hold in their vaults.</p>
<p>Would (negative) IOR be a sufficiently effective monetary instrument for the Fed to manage monetary policy? Other implications?</p>

                                <p>With all the well-deserved attention going to Kevin Drum’s excellent <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2013/01/lead-crime-link-gasoline">Mother Jones article on crime rates and lead in gasoline</a> (more <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2013/01/lead-and-crime-correction">here</a>), I thought it worth revisiting my post on the subject from a year and a half ago, which was itself prompted by Angry Bear’s own inimitable <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/get-lead-out-ii.html">Robert Waldmann</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/government-gets-the-lead-out-crime-plummets.html">Government Gets the Lead Out, Crime Plummets</a></p>
<p>In which I said:</p>
<blockquote><p>We’re seeing it in spades: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraethyllead#History">history of tetraethyl lead</a> (read it and weep) is a tragic textbook case of market/profit interests eviscerating the commons and making us all (including the rich) far worse off, in the name of “the invisible hand” making us all better off.</p>
<p>That ebil gubmint man with his heavy-handed regulations impinging on honest businesspeople (who are just trying to make a buck, for everyone’s benefit) sure did have a pernicious effect, huh?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can only imagine how many <em>trillions</em> of dollars that lead-driven crime wave has cost our country, and how many tens of millions of lives that lead poisoning has destroyed.</p>
<p>But don’t worry: you can rely on profit-making companies to “allocate our resources most efficiently.” Trust me on this.</p>

<p> CBO: SS Scheduled vs Payable Benefits (Rosser&#8217;s Equation illustrated)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9bLHAYFroVQ/UN_ZjJm-YwI/AAAAAAAAAGc/2k_zd3cc_5c/s1600/2012+CBO+Ex+9+(Rosser's+Equation).tiff"><img border="0" height="228" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9bLHAYFroVQ/UN_ZjJm-YwI/AAAAAAAAAGc/2k_zd3cc_5c/s1600/2012+CBO+Ex+9+(Rosser's+Equation).tiff" width="320"></a></p>
<p>&#8216;Rosser&#8217;s Equation&#8217; is something between an in-joke and tribute to Prof. Barkley Rosser, Jr of JMU, an economist friend of mine who pointed out a surprising result: real payable benefits after projected Trust Fund depletion and subsequent 25% cut will still be higher in actual basket of goods terms than those of current retirees. This is because the scheduled benefit formula delivers something like 160% of the current benefit and as Prof Rosser pointed out to me long ago 75% of 160%=120%.   </p>
<p>The above Exhibit 9 from CBO&#8217;s 2012 Long Term Projections for Social Security resolves Rosser&#8217;s equation for selected demographic cohorts and income quintiles. And the results show that the retiree born in 1947 who reached FRA (Full Retirement Age) in 2012 would see an initial benefit ranging from $10k to $25k and representing 100% of the schedule. On the other hand the retiree born in 1970 and who will reach FRA at age 67 in 2037, that is after TF Depletion would see initial benefits in 2012 dollars ranging from $12k to $33k.    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now there is no doubt that an overnight 25% cut in benefits at Trust Fund Depletion would represent huge sticker shock for then retirees. And there are very good reasons based in societal equity for scheduled benefits to rise at the real rate the formula delivers. As such we should make every effort to find ways of closing the gap between payable and scheduled from the bottom up rather than forcing scheduled down simply to avoid the shock of of cut. Because the risk is that the &#8216;cure&#8217; might deliver a worse result in real terms than the &#8216;crisis&#8217; left unaddressed.    </p>
<p>Which is why I have been maintaining for years that &#8216;Nothing&#8217; IS a Plan. Not as good a plan as it was when Prof Rosser and I started corresponding five plus years ago, circumstances have changed. Still it represents the &#8220;First Do No Harm&#8221; alternative, after all a check in 2040 20% better in real terms than an equivalently situated retiree gets today doesn&#8217;t exactly meet the definition of existential crisis for Social Security. </p>

<blockquote><p>“cutting unemployment insurance would increase employment, as it would end payments for people who fail to find work and would reduce the cushion provided after layoffs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w18668">Here’s one</a> pretty well-done data point (several, actually) suggesting that he’s wrong:</p>
<blockquote><p>In theory, greater employment protection should dampen the effects of output movements on employment and therefore reduce the Okun coefficient. In Figure 10 (right panel), we test this idea by plotting the coefficient against the OECD’s overall EPL index (averaged over 1985-2008, the period for which it is available). The relationship has the wrong sign, and it is statistically insignificant.[9]</p>
<p>[9] For New Zealand, the EPL index is available over 1990-2008. We also find no relationship between the Okun coefficient and the various components of the EPL index.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Two days ago, Dan posted an entry by run75441 titled “<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/scotus-chastises-congress-and-executive.html">SCOTUS Chastises Congress and the Executive Branch</a>.”  The post’s title wasn’t quite accurate; run’s post was about Chief Justice John Roberts’ <a href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-31/politics/36103796_1_federal-courts-congressional-leaders-fiscal-cliff">annual state-of-the-judicial-branch report</a>, in which he was writing in his capacity as administrative head of that branch, not in his actual judicial capacity, and not for the other justices.  </p>
<p>Run (who didn’t title the post; Dan did) deeply criticized Roberts for bragging about the austerity of the federal courts in recent years, including his own court, which, he also bragged, had decided on 64 cases in its last term.  That was down from, I think, 70 the term before, and the main reason for that reduction was that the ACA case consumed a full week of oral-argument slots&#8211; the full week at issue normally consisting of arguments in six&#8211;count ‘em, six!&#8211;cases; some full weeks consist of four arguments, leaving the justices slightly less exhausted than they are after the six-argument work weeks.  </p>
<p>Roberts implied&#8211;he did not say so, expressly, but he did imply&#8211;that Congress and the White House take a cue from the justices and force the federal government to make do with less money.  To which I suggest that the justices really lead by example, and get rid of their four-justices-apiece law clerks, who do most of their work for them and start doing their legally-mandated jobs themselves.  After all, the federal government at least doesn’t pay salaries to congressional lobbyists&#8211;the equivalent of Supreme Court law clerks.</p>
<p>Anyway, I posted a comment to run’s post, and then asked Dan to add it as an update to run’s post, which he did.  My comment said:</p>
<div dir="ltr">The Supreme Court is rarely in session.  It’s seasonal, part-time work.  They usually hear argument in 10 cases a month, seven months a year.  In December, they didn’t hear even that many.</div>
<div dir="ltr">There’s really sooo much that can, and should, be said about the issue of (virtually universal lack of) access to the Supreme Court, and its repercussions.  Roberts’ bizarre, cutesy annual report is … oh … I don’t know …characteristically hubristic? </div>
<p>Run responded to my comment, and I then responded to his, writing:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div dir="ltr">What’s especially outrageous is the type of situation you’re talking about [a federal habeas corpus case challenging the constitutionality of aspects of the proceedings in a state-court criminal case]: The Supreme Court almost never agrees to hear cases on “direct appeal” (a legal term of art) from state supreme courts, in criminal or civil cases, with the major exception that they do often agree to do so in criminal cases when it is the state (i.e., the prosecution) that is asking them to hear hear the case in order to overrule a (rare) state supreme court ruling in favor of the criminal defendant. In state-court criminal cases, when it is the defendant who is asking the Supreme Court to hear the case in order to overturn a conviction, on constitutional grounds, the Supreme Court seems to figure that the criminal defendant can file a habeas corpus petition in a lower federal court. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Which they can, but the Supreme court has made that right an all-but-empty one&#8211;just a shell game, really&#8211;by interpreting a 1996 “jurisdictional” statute in a way that bars the lower federal courts from throwing out the state-court conviction on constitutional grounds in almost every case. With each passing Supreme Court term, the right to federal habeas review becomes even narrower, a seeming impossibility until it happens. In the last two years, the Supreme Court has treated that right as all but nonexistent. So the almost-total lack of access to the Supreme Court on direct appeal by state-court criminal defendants effectively removes access to constitutional review in federal court. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">This is even truer in civil cases [including some that involve incredibly important, truly fundamental rights of the sort protected under international human rights laws, although they have nothing at all to do with, say, prison inmates; really&#8211;trust me on this], thanks to a set of perverse, gimmicky Supreme Court-created “jurisdictional” doctrines, which the Supreme Court has stood by and watched metastasize to remove any access to federal court in order to make a constitutional challenge, except for ExxonMobil, which asked the Supreme Court to limit the doctrine at issue, which the Court did, so narrowly as to apply in almost no other case, especially since the other, related doctrine actually bars access in the circumstance in which ExxonMobil was allowed to have it. (Sort of like Bush v. Gore.)</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Anthony Kennedy, the leader of this state-courts-have-sovereignty-and-dignity! juggernaut, likes to say this is done in the name of liberty. (Isn’t everything the rightwing wants done in the name of liberty?!) Which reminds me of a political science class I once took on Maoism. [Maoism] included, basically, the routine use of Orwellian language, in which everything is the opposite of what its name or description indicates. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Of course, the current Supreme Court’s goal&#8211;the goal of the legal right since the early 1980s&#8211;is to turn the law into nothing but circuitous yellow-brick-road procedure: a dead-end labyrinth whose very purpose is its circuitry and fruitlessness. They’ve come incredibly close to succeeding.</div>
<p>There’s a whole lot more about this that can, and should, be said, and I plan to write in more depth about it.  Which will make me the only one writing for public consumption about it; the general news media covers only “substantive” legal issues (“substantive” being another legal term of art; legal issues are either “substantive” or “procedural.”)  And rarely covers even substantive issues that aren’t part of the culture wars debate.  Which is really nice for the legal right, because their justices and judges can, and do, do just about anything they want, completely under the radar. </p>
<p>But for now, I’ll just add that the judicial right, lead on this by Kennedy and Clarence Thomas, conflate state sovereignty with freedom, but, at least regarding those two and their wingy three colleagues and some (but not all of their lower-court compadres), do so only with respect (pun most definitely intended) to state courts.  To them, state legislative- and executive-branch actions (e.g., state statutes) are fair game for constitutional challenges, and they harbor no inhibition whatsoever about impinging upon state “sovereignty” in recognizing the Constitution’s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supremacy_Clause">Supremacy Clause</a> when striking down as unconstitutional state statutes that the political right doesn’t care much for; Texas’s colleague-admissions affirmative action law, say.  (Sit tight for the upcoming oral argument there in that case.)  And their summary reversal of the Montana Supreme Court’s ruling late last year upholding the constitutionality of Montana’s longstanding campaign-finance statute is another example that comes (very) quickly to mind.  My mind, anyway.</p>
<p>To be fair to Kennedy, and certainly to his credit, he&#8211;and he alone, among the Fab Five&#8211;does extend this principle to state statutes that liberals don’t like.  Texas’s criminal anti-sodomy statute is one example, but there are other important ones as well.  </p>
<p>But, in what appears to me to be nothing more than just <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_courtesy">old-fashioned professional courtesy</a>, Kennedy effectively exempts state judicial branches from Supremacy Clause mandates to honor constitutional rights of individuals.  And state courts violate individual procedural and substantive rights, in criminal cases and in certain types of civil cases, with absolute abandon, comfortable in the knowledge that they can.  The result, far, far more often than not, is the very antithesis of freedom.  Except in the Matter Hatter-esque language that the legal right has found so useful.</p>
<p>So, next time Kennedy or Thomas writes an opinion singing the praises of state sovereignty&#8211;by which they almost always just mean state-court sovereignty&#8211;as advancing “freedom,” ask them (rhetorically, of course; they won’t actually hear you unless you retain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Clement">Paul Clement</a> to speak to them for you, which was basically run75441’s point) whether they think that, say, German Jews in the mid- and late 1930s were freer because Germany was a sovereign state.  <br />I will, anyway.  Or maybe I’ll just ask the Mad Hatter.  Orwell lives.  These days, though, in this country it&#8217;s called &#8220;federalism.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Occasionally, one of my AB posts goes viral (relatively speaking), racking up a couple thousand views on statcounter.  This is one that I hope does.  Actually, I hope it gets a million hits. </p>
<p>Yeah.  A million hits would be good.</p>
<p>Is there such a thing as hitting the Supreme Court in effigy?</p>

                                <p>An important post from <i>Izabella Kaminska</i> at FT Alphaville and recommended reading (h/t rjs): </p>
<p><a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2013/01/02/1319583/on-the-new-purpose-of-government-debt/">On the new purpose of government debt &#8211; </a>  Frances Coppola has whipped up an <a href="http://coppolacomment.blogspot.fr/2013/01/when-governments-become-banks.html">absolutely fabulous commentary</a> on this<a href="http://www.bis.org/publ/work399.pdf"> Bank of Iinternational Settlements working paper</a> on safe assets, which cuts straight to the point of. As she neatly expresses, in our new looking glass world of finance… <em>“the purpose of government debt is not to fund government spending. It is to provide safe assets.”</em><br />
<blockquote>Therefore, governments whose debt is regarded as a safe asset must operate monetary and fiscal policy in such a way that their debt retains its value. They cannot allow inflation to rise significantly, and they must maintain control of public spending to ensure that they can always meet their liabilities when they fall due. The very existence of safe assets relies on the soundness of sovereign monetary and fiscal policy.<br />From a national economic perspective, this looks completely ridiculous. On the one hand, government must produce unlimited amounts of debt to meet the financial system&#8217;s demand for safe assets, and allow the central bank to exchange this debt freely for new money. But on the other hand, they must maintain strict control of inflation and government spending so that the safe assets they are producing remain safe. So the debt/GDP level can rise to the skies, though they will pay nothing much for it: in fact debt/GDP would become a completely meaningless measure of the soundness of public finances. But woe betide any government that ran a deficit. The BIS paper envisages governments running primary surpluses to fund debt issuance:</p></blockquote>
<p><em><br /></em>Lifted from comments Frances Copppola says&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>This isn&#8217;t about private debt &#8211; it&#8217;s about public debt morphing into an asset that is so important to financial stability that governments must organise their monetary and fiscal policies around supporting it. In fact as people rely on public debt as a safe home for long-term savings, the more savings they have the greater the need for public debt.</p></blockquote>
