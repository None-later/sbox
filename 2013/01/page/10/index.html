<div dir="ltr">[I]sn’t it paramount the president explain to the public what the debt ceiling issue actually is, rather than allowing the Republicans to keep misinforming the public that it’s an increase in budget allocations rather than a payment for budget allocations already made?  This quirk in the law&#8211;the requirement that Congress authorize payment of costs already budgeted, already promised (e.g., in bond interest, Medicare payments, Social Security payments, veterans benefits)&#8211;is something that almost no member of the general public knows.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Obama keeps saying, in a single sentence, that he won’t allow default on money already appropriated and owing.  That’s nice.  But does he really not understand that this goes right over most people’s heads, because the Repubs keep telling them the opposite, and because the debt ceiling law is a technicality that most people simply don’t know about, and because that technicality has no counterpart in, say, normal living experience?</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">This is beginning to seem to me like the 2009-2010 ACA debate, redux&#8211;with the rightwing misinforming the public, and Obama thinking that the public knows specifics that the public flatly does not know.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">So here’s a suggestion: Obama’s shown a fondness for adopting the Republicans’ messaging by analogizing the federal government to a family’s finances, even though this analogy, when it involves economic stimulus and other fiscal-appropriations issues, actually amounts to a misrepresentation of fact.  But on the debt ceiling matter, the government-is-similar-to-families analogy is exactly apt.  If someone already runs up large credit card bills, he owes the money even if he decides to rip up his credit cards and stop running up personal debt.  If he doesn’t pay the credit card bills he’s accrued, he’s DEFAULTING on those debts, and his credit rating will plunge.  And if someone owes monthly mortgage payments, he can’t simply stop paying them, and expect to keep his home.  He’ll lose the home in a foreclosure proceeding.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">See? Not hard to explain.  But if Obama can’t or won’t explain this, some other Democrat who can garner the public’s attention should.  My suggestion: Bill Clinton.  And if Clinton won’t, then maybe Joe Biden can.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; Me, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/will-republicans-debt-ceiling-is-about.html">Angry Bear, Jan. 7</a></div>
<p>I opened that post on Monday by quoting from a Greg Sargent blog post from that morning, and so I “tagged” Sargent by name on my post.  I think he read my post.  And maybe <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/us/politics/after-newtown-congress-must-act-pelosi-says.html">maybe Nancy Pelosi did</a>, too.  (Nah.  The post didn’t get that many hits.  Although I did post something similar as a comment to a Dave Weigel article in Slate, and Weigel “liked” the comment using the “like” button on the comment. Maybe Pelosi read the Weigel article and my comment.)</p>
<p>Anyway, here’s what Sargent wrote in his Morning Plum blog piece this morning:</p>
<div dir="ltr">It is one of the most remarkable GOP spin jobs in recent memory : Republicans are painstakingly redefining raising the debt ceiling as something that would constitute giving something to the President, when in fact it is something that is necessary to avert financial disaster for the whole country.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Republicans are being very transparent about the goal of redefining the debt limit on these terms. For instance, the Hill <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/276205-mcconnell-to-take-entitlement-talks-lead-boehner-in-back-seat">reports today that Mitch McConnell and John Boehner are diverging on how to handle the next round of fiscal talks</a>. Senate Republicans want a more aggressive approach to debt ceiling hostage taking than House Republicans do, in the belief that it is the GOP’s primary leverage point to get the spending cuts they want. John Boehner recently said he believes the sequester gives Republicans more leverage than the debt ceiling does, but Senate Republicans disagree:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Boehner said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that the automatic spending cuts known as the sequester give Republicans their best opportunity to push Obama to accept reforms. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But Senate Republicans think the debt ceiling is a stronger lever. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“The debt ceiling has a fair amount of leverage. It’s the only thing that I can think of for the foreseeable future that the president needs Congress to do,” said a Senate Republican aide. [Sargent’s bolddface.]</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Get the trick here? Senate Republicans are describing the eventual hike in the debt ceiling as something the president needs from Congress, not something the whole country needs from Congress. Of course, Boehner is <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/141093-boehner-failure-to-raise-debt-ceiling-would-mean-financial-disaster">already on record admitting in 2011</a> that not raising it would constitute “financial disaster,” which may explain why he is backing off the claim that the debt limit gives GOP leverage. McConnell, apparently, disagrees.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">This is only the latest sign of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/08/gop-disarray-over-debt-ceiling/">GOP disarray around the party’s debt ceiling strategy</a>. Even if the party is struggling with their strategy here, however, it’s worth noting that it has been successful in redefining the meaning of debt ceiling hikes. Note that this subtle redefinition of lifting the debt limit as something that would constitute a favor to Obama has passed almost entirely unnoticed, and has essentially been internalized and accepted by many political observers. Which brings us to the next item.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr"> * Pelosi pushes Obama on debt ceiling: [Sargent’s boldface.] Nancy Pelosi is now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/us/politics/after-newtown-congress-must-act-pelosi-says.html">calling on Obama to take his case about GOP debt ceiling hostage taking directly to the people, and urging him resort to the 14th amendment option if necessary</a>.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">As the above suggests — and as polls confirm — Dems need to better educate the public about what the debt ceiling is and what default would actually mean. The GOP has successfully spun their intransigence as synonymous with holding the line against spending, when in fact it amounts to nothing more than threatening to default on debts that have been already been incurred.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/09/the-morning-plum-clever-gop-spin-on-debt-ceiling/">The Morning Plum: Clever GOP spin on debt ceiling</a></div>
<p>Yes.  And I have one further suggestion: In explaining what the debt ceiling actually is, and what will happen if the Repubs do what they threaten to do, Obama and the other Dems should use a word that chrystalizes the Repub threat: Deadbeat.</p>
<p>Call this spade a spade.  The threat is to force the federal government to become a deadbeat.  And point out that deadbeatism&#8211;I just coined that word, but I won’t copyright it; the Dems can use it, if they’d like&#8211;is now part of the Republican policy playbook.</p>

And how &#8216;public displays&#8217; by our politicians offer up little information:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the 2012 fiscal year, the federal government <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130107/us-immigration-spending/?utm_hp_ref=homepage&#038;ir=homepage">spent more on immigration enforcement</a> — $18 billion — than on every other federal law enforcement agencies combined, according to a new <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/pillars-reportinbrief.pdf">report</a> from the Migration Policy Institute. The spending on Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection dwarfs the combined $14.4 billion spent on the FBI; Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Drug Enforcement Administration and U.S. Secret Service.
<p>The U.S. has <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20130107/us-immigration-spending/?utm_hp_ref=homepage&#038;ir=homepage">spent</a> more than $187 billion on immigration enforcement since President Reagan <a href="http://www.migrationpolicy.org/pubs/pillars-reportinbrief.pdf">signed</a> the Immigration Reform and Control Act in 1986 — which first made it illegal for employers to hire undocumented workers along with strengthening U.S. border security. Adjusted for inflation, the U.S. now spends <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/07/immigration-enforcement-cost_n_2425647.html?1357584619">15 times as much</a> on immigration enforcement as it did in the mid-1980s. And the number of deportations and immigration-related prosecutions has also <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/07/immigration-enforcement-cost_n_2425647.html?1357584619">jumped along with the increased spending</a>:</p>

<div dir="ltr">This shift from wages to profits is called redistribution. It is the central fact of American economic life. And it is the primary reason that economic inequality in the United States has skyrocketed.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Yet wages, which are descending, are taxed at a higher rate than income derived from corporate profits — capital gains and dividends. Far from mitigating the consequences of this shift, the U.S. tax code reinforces the redistribution from wages to profits. Broadly speaking, it rewards the winners of this epochal shift and penalizes the losers, who are the vast majority of Americans.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The lower tax rates for capital gains and dividends, then, effectively reward offshoring more than work done within the United States, increase economic inequality and deprive the federal government of revenue it will need to support an aging population and meet its other obligations. None of this upsets Republicans, but it would be nice if Democrats realized that these tax breaks undermine everything they stand for.</div>

<p>Yesterday <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/the-continued-necessity-of-explaining.html">I wrote</a> that I expect the Dems to recapture control of the House in the 2014 election, despite the current extreme-gerrymandering.  I listed reasons why, and noted that while it’s been reported that in order to do that the Dems would have to win nationally, in the aggregate, in House races by between 7% and 8%, they did that in 2006 and 2008; at least that’s what I read recently.  </p>
<p>A main focus of that post was on the importance of ensuring that the public actually understands that “raising the debt ceiling” is not raising appropriations but, instead, simply authorizing payment by the Treasury of already-appropriated expenditures.  </p>
<p>But there are other tremendously important facts that the Dems badly need to tell or explain to the public.  One is something that I was shocked to read a day or two: that Defense Department appropriations have doubled in the last decade, from about $270 billion to (if I recall correctly) about $580 billion&#8211;during a decade of dramatic tax reductions.</p>
<p>Another is that the budget deals of the last two years, including the “fiscal cliff” one, coupled with a (however-slowly) recovering economy (fueled partly, at least in the rust-belt Midwest, by the auto-industry bailout), will have reduced the national debt by about $2.7 trillion dollars.  A fourth of that (if I correctly recall the article I read) is from the tax hikes in the fiscal cliff deal.  Y’know, the part of that deal that the Republicans fought so hard against and that most of their House delegation voted against.  The remainder comes from&#8211;yup&#8211;reductions in federal spending. </p>
<p>Obama of course will tout the reductions in federal spending, in his inaugural and State of the Union addresses.  He probably also will mention the added revenue from the fiscal-cliff-deal tax-rate increases on the very wealthy.  </p>
<p>But he also needs to point out&#8211;to say and then explain&#8211;what Meyerson does in his column today.  </p>
<p>Obama, it seems, thinks that explaining anything economics-related to the masses is like explaining rocket science to people like, say, me.  It’s not. He needs to do it.  He needs a speechwriter who, rather than concentrating on writing memorable, lofty lines&#8211;the standard job of presidential speechwriters&#8211;actually understands fiscal policy and can, and will, craft a speech that explains it in the way some of the best liberal pundits do.  </p>
<p>But if he doesn’t do that, others, I trust, <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/plank/111731/welcome-another-golden-era-liberal-senators">will</a>.  And soon.  They’ll do effectively enough to create a public groundswell that will win the House for the Dems next year.</p>

<p>Update: Besides not prosecuting particulars who promulgated much of 2008, what makes this settlement bad is letting banks off the hook:</p>
<p><em>&#8220;In the settlement announced Monday between the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency and ten of the largest banks and other mortgage providers, the government gives up the right to prosecute banks for past wrongful foreclosures. In exchange, the banks part with another $8.5 billion, of which $5.2 billion is for loan modifications and $3.3 billion is for people whose mortgages were wrongfully foreclosed.</em><br /><em></em> <br /><em>It’s a pittance. With 3.8 million homeowners covered by the settlement, that works out to less than $2,000 per homeowner.&#8221; </em><a href="http://prospect.org/article/banks-win-again" target="_blank"><em>http://prospect.org/article/banks-win-again</em></a><em> &#8220;</em>The Banks Win Again&#8221;</p>
<p>$2,000 per homeowner in many cases might be two months of a mortgage payment. The settlement hardly qualifies as major.<br /> Is the $8.5 billion Foreclose and Fraud Settlement Enough of a Penalty?</p>
<p> Are The Federal Reserve and the OCC acting in good faith in letting banks off the hook for their past predatory lending practices? Yves Smith at Naked Capitalism labels it a sellout at the expense of mortgage holders: <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/01/8-5-billion-foreclosure-fraud-settlement-yet-another-loss-for-homeowners-touted-as-a-victory.html#comment-1010312" target="_blank">$8.5 billion Foreclosure Fraud Settlement: Yet Another Loss for Homeowners Touted as a Victory</a>.</p>
<p>When compared to TARP and other programs created to save TBTF and STBB (soon to be banks) plus the trillions pumped into the economy as a result the failures of banks and Wall Street, the $8.5 billion does seem paltry in comparison. Rather than taking the lead and closely auditing the review of wrongfully foreclosed mortgages and past practices, the OCC once again lets banks off the hook by giving them the ability to independently review both issues. Haven&#8217;t we come this way before? Banks will not do it or will be selective in what they choose to disclose. Besides the history of banks failing to act in good faith, there is also a history of government agencies and branches failure to provide consumer protection. </p>
<p>It appears the dogs causing much of this debacle are kicking back their hind legs in an attempt to hide the droppings left behind because of their failures. Frankly, it is amazing the OCC is still in that mode of protecting thrifts and national banks, which caused much of the issue in the last decade after they were identified as the culprits who failed to regulate. For those who may not be familiar with the OCC&#8217;s lack of supervision, I would offer Columbia&#8217;s &#8220;The Audit&#8221; as a refresher: <a href="http://www.cjr.org/the_audit/sleeping_watchdogs.php?page=all">Let Sleeping Dogs Lie</a>.</p>

<p>To finalize and give strength to the OCC limited supervision (2007) of National banks and thrifts, SCOTUS over ruled states attempting to fill the void in regulating predatory bank lending practices. In a 5-3 ruling, SCOTUS tied the hands of states which attempted to regulate banks supervised by OCC. Michigan was joined by numerous states in an effort to control predatory bank lending.( <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#038;sid=ahTRNjftAoOU" target="_blank">Banks Win Shield From State Regulation at High Court</a>)</p>
<p>A mixed bag of conservative and liberal justices ruled on <i>Watters vs Wachovia Bank</i> in the same manner as over turning State Usury Laws in Marquette Nat. Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service Corp in 1978. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marquette_Nat._Bank_of_Minneapolis_v._First_of_Omaha_Service_Corp" target="_blank">SCOTUS cited the National Banking Act</a> to give the OCC the capability to regulate national banks and thrifts over turn state regulations. . The irony is Congress moving quickly to repeal Glass Steagall and change the National Banking Act to allow Citibank to merge with Travelers Insurance; but, Congress saw no need to act to allow states to continue the regulation of national banks. Both actions by SCOTUS and the failure of Congress to pass new legislation have contributed much to the issues we have today. Always look to the money . . .</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m actually agnostic on this choice.  The always excellent Charles Pierce <a href="http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/chuck-hagel-defense-secretary-nomination-010713?src=soc_fcbks">makes a good case for Hagel</a>,  but why should Obama go for any Republican?  This just continues to  promote the canard that Republicans are somehow stronger or more capable  on defense issues than Democrats.</p>
<p>The irony here is that the greatest opposition is coming from Republicans, some of whom have gone so far as to call him an <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/mr-hagel-and-jews_693993.html">anti-Semite</a>*  because he has <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/01/07/why-hagel-matters.html">spoken openly and honestly </a>about  the excessive influence the pro-Israel lobby has on American foreign  policy.   When we consider the pros and cons of any individual for any  position, we ought to do it on the basis of real qualifications and real  disqualifications, not make-believe nonsense put forward by neocons and  the cadre of rabid right-wingers whose policies have done such great  and possibly irreparable damage to the world in this century.<br />  <br />I rarely agree with Mish on anything political, and to find myself <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/01/obamas-chance-to-do-something-right.html">agreeing in principle with him</a> when he&#8217;s <a href="http://www.creators.com/opinion/pat-buchanan/why-the-war-party-fears-hagel.html">agreeing in principle with Patrick Buchanan</a> has my stomach turning and my head spinning.  </p>
<p>Vertigo,  nausea and angular momentum aside, this appointment is the president&#8217;s  decision, and I want to see the debate procede along substantive rather  than ideological, illogical or untruthful  lines.   And I most  particularly don&#8217;t want to see him <a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/articles/hagel-thesis_666589.html">get Riced</a>.</p>
<p>Now, where do I pick up my pony?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>It’s already clear that <a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/01/08/16411798-boehner-debt-limit-not-the-ultimate-leverage">Republican congressional leaders now recognize that</a> the Republicans <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/site/newspaper/opinion/ct-oped-0108-threat-20130108,0,2356965.story">actually have no leverage at all </a>on the debt ceiling matter; they’re not going to pull that trigger, and everyone knows it.  But Obama (or other prominent Dems) still <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/will-republicans-debt-ceiling-is-about.html">really, really need to explain to the public</a> that the debt ceiling concerns authorization for the Treasury Department to pay already-accrued bills, not an authorization to increase appropriations.  Otherwise, the Republicans will have most people believing that the Democrats forced an increase in future budget appropriations.  And that gives the Republicans a head start (if only an initial one, before the public learns what the Republicans consider “wasteful spending”) in the “sequester” negotiations, the crisis on which the Repubs now pin their leverage hopes. </p>
<p>My bet, and my hope, is that the sequester negotiations result in only a short-term resolution, expressly for the purpose of allowing the 2014 midterm elections determine the outcome of the revenues-vs.-dramatically-cutting-federal-spending war.  The Democrats have (in my opinion) a better-than-even chance of regaining control of the House in that election, despite the extreme gerrymandering since 2010.  </p>
<p>It’s been reported recently that to gain control of the House, the Dems would have to win the nationwide vote by somewhere between 7% and 8%.  But according to an article I read a few days ago (I can’t remember where), that’s what they did in 2006 and 2008.  And I think it’s likely that large numbers of seniors who voted in House elections in 2010 and 2012 for the Republican in their district will switch parties in 2014, now that the Repubs have made their safety-net position clear.  </p>
<p>At least as important, I also think that large numbers of so-called working class whites in various parts of the country who for decades now have automatically voted Republican, will no longer do so, automatically.  That began, in some rust belt states, in the last election.  And as I’ve watched footage of the devastation of Sandy in Staten Island and Queens&#8211;New York City’s two more-conservative boroughs&#8211;and on Long Island, I keep wondering how many of the storm’s victims supported Republican presidential and congressional candidates in recent elections before the post-Sandy one.  </p>
<p>Just as I wonder, as I read news accounts of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/drought-threatens-to-halt-critical-barge-traffic-on-mississippidrought-threatens-to-halt-critical-barge-traffic-on-mississippidrought-threatens-to-halt-critical-barge-traffic-on-mississippi/2013/01/06/92498b88-5694-11e2-bf3e-76c0a789346f_story.html">the frantic efforts of the Army Corps of Engineers to keep Mississippi barge traffic flowing</a> despite the record drought in the Midwest, how many Missourians and Iowans who vote Republican will rethink their views about the necessity of properly funding the federal government, and whether the problem, as Mitch McConnell recently diagnosed it, is really not inadequate revenue.</p>
<p>Add to that the obvious: that the public is, overwhelmingly, I&#8217;m pretty sure, just plain sick of <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/01/07/this-is-what-would-happen-if-we-breach-the-debt-ceiling/">these nihilistic pseudo-adults</a>.  (Although it&#8217;s still really important to ensure that the public actually knows just how nihilistic these people <i>are</i>.)</p>
<p>So, if the proverbial can is again kicked down the real road, and the inevitable screams of indignation from the punditry are heard, my rhetorical question to them will be: Why not try to actually analyze the situation rather than just use autopilot mode?</p>

<p>Social Security/Medicare vs Corporate Welfare</p>
<p>The denouement of the fiscal cliff debate behind us (and not, I regret, with the best results&#8211;more on that later) we now face the next stage, in which we can expect the right-side extremists to threaten to hold the government hostage unless spending is cut (meaning, to the right-side, spending for people-oriented projects like the safety net but not extending generally to spending on the military or the corporate welfare with which the tax code was reinforced through the fiscal cliff deal that extended or made permanent many of the notorious giveaways from the Bush years) and debt is limited.</p>
<p>All of this will be pushed by those in the &#8220;tea party&#8221; and Koch-funded right-wing as so-called &#8220;fiscal conservatism.&#8221;</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t.  The agenda on the right is about as far from fiscal conservatism as anything can be.  The right is quite happy to take a &#8220;no tax increases forever&#8221; position, at that same time as gleefully opting for more and more expansive defense and defense-related spending.  Similarly, the fiscal cliff deal with its reinforcement of corporate welfare in the extension or making permanent of the Bush year corporate tax giveaways demonstrates that there is hardly a corporate tax expenditure that this gang doesn&#8217;t like.  Take two examples:  the R&#038;D credit and the &#8220;active financing&#8221; exception to Subpart F. 
<ul>
<li>The R&#038;D credit allows companies to understate their corporate income by giving a dollar-for-dollar credit for R&#038;D expenditures.  The purported objective is to encourage more R&#038;D.  But this credit was examined closely ages ago and came up short&#8211;it really is just a subsidy to corporations (like Big Pharm) that do considerable research.  And those companies happen to be companies that HAVE to do considerable research to stay competitive.  The subsidy just comes along for the ride; it doesn&#8217;t drive the research.  This is evidenced by the fact that several times the temporary subsidy was extended after the year of the research had closed&#8211;there is no way that a retroactive subsidy can incentivize additional research in a past year! </li>
<li>The &#8220;active financing&#8221; exception lets banks forego immediate Subpart F taxation on their international interest and dividend income, because, they say, that&#8217;s their &#8220;active&#8221; business.  But then of course they are encouraged to locate as much passive income in those active financing subsidiaries as possible, to be able to exempt as much as possible from Subpart F immediate taxation.  It is just one of the many crutches we give multinational banks, yet they continue to be a genuine risk for the US economy and a genuine risk for again requiring US bailouts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other corporate welfare examples include everything from the continuing subsidy (after more than a 100 years of profits) to Big Oil and other natural resource extraction, to Big Pharm and Big IT from inadequate rules against the so-called sales of critical IT property to offshore affiliates, to companies that set up captive insurance companies, and to companies that use the vastly frontloaded &#8220;expensing&#8221; of equipment purchases through the accelerated depreciation system and the more recently added separate expensing provisions.  (On the latter:  The benefit of frontloading is considerable deferral of taxes, which means higher profits to the companies and lower revenues to the government.  It might arguably make sense as a temporary stimulus from time to time, but it has been a permanent part of our system now for more than a decade and is not justifiable in that framework.)</p>

<p>So corporate welfare should be what is cut, not Social Security or Medicare benefits, when we start looking at areas where cash is senselessly flowing in ways that don&#8217;t further the quality of life of typical Americans.  See Carl Gibson, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/carl-gibson/cut-corporate-welfare-not_b_2421340.html?view=print&#038;comm_ref=false">Cut Corporate Welfare, Not the Safety Net</a>, HuffPost Politics (Jan. 7, 2013). </p>
<p>As Gibson notes,</p>
<blockquote><p>In Congress&#8217; latest &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; deal that supposedly had to be passed in order to avoid economic calamity, we spent <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/31/unemployment-insurance-extended_n_2389634.html">$30 billion</a> on extending unemployment benefits for a year, and <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/01/eight-corporate-subsidies-in-the-fiscal-cliff-bill-from-goldman-sachs-to-disney-to-nascar.html">$205 billion</a> in corporate tax breaks, subsidies and excessive tax loopholes. Most of these Christmas gifts for corporate America are benefiting major, multi-billion dollar corporations that <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/11/03/360185/30-corporations-no-taxes/">haven&#8217;t paid a dime of U.S. income taxes in years</a>, like GE and Boeing. In other words, taxpayers spent six times more on giving free money to companies making record profits than we did to making sure the people who were laid off by these corporations can still feed their families. $205 billion in corporate goodies was okay with Speaker Boehner, but <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2013-01-04/news/36132767_1_votes-on-sandy-aid-christie-sandy-victims">$60 billion</a> in Hurricane Sandy relief apparently wasn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the New York Times today hit on another of the absurd subsidies that crept into our Code in a well-intentioned provision to help small farmers but has resulted in most real estate investors seldom paying taxes on their gains and many corporations using the device to avoid millions in taxes annually.  That&#8217;s the &#8220;section 1031&#8221; like-kind exchange.  There&#8217;s really no normative policy justification for allowing this kind of exchange to avoid taxation of the realized gain whereas other exchanges (non-like-kind) do not.  There is even less justification for the avoidance of taxation for the kinds of intermediary exchanges that have evolved over time, allowing actual sales to occur, so long as the seller ensures that the money is put into an escrow account until it is used to buy &#8220;replacement&#8221; property.  While it is hard to see any real justification for any of the like-kind exchange provisions, and certainly not for the intermediated sales + replacement regimes, it is especially problematic when the intermediated regimes become subject to abuse&#8211;where intermediaries allow the exchanging taxpayer full access to the cash, e.g., as collateral for loans, etc. during the period when no use is permitted.  The New York Times covered that issue today.  See David Kocieniewski, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/business/economy/companies-exploit-tax-break-for-asset-exchanges-trial-evidence-shows.html">Major Companies Push the Limits of a Tax Br</a>eak, New York Times (Jan. 6, 2013).</p>
<blockquote><p>The federal government now allows more than $1.1 trillion a year in this and other tax expenditures. Each of those incentives — which include hundreds of exemptions, exclusions, deferrals and preferential rates — either adds to the budget deficit or shifts the cost of government to other taxpayers.<br />Some are narrowly targeted and offer aid to specific industries like Nascar owners, asparagus farmers, oil companies, yacht makers or solar panel producers. Others, like accelerated depreciation or the tax code’s preference for debt financing over equity, provide tax benefits for wide swaths of businesses.<br />“Tax expenditures are very similar to an entitlement program, so they’re easy to start,” said George K. Yin, former chief of staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, and now <a href="http://www.law.virginia.edu/lawweb/faculty.nsf/fhpbi/1223683">a professor</a> at the University of Virginia School of Law. “But once a tax break gets started, people think they’re entitled to it, so they are very difficult to end.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Professor Yin has it exactly right&#8211;those tax breaks are very &#8220;easy to start&#8221; and very lucrative for corporations.  Once they get them, they will say (as the real estate people do here) that jobs depend on keeping them going.  That is usually not true, or much less of an impact than claimed.  But Congress caves easily on those items, and we go on with a giveaway code for Big Business.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Now the old world can address the fiscal imbalance of the new.  It seems that some of the best minds in the USA are trying to figure out how the US Treasury can disburse money without issuing debt.   Finally a topic I know something about.  There are many ways.</p>
<p>1) Paul Krugman proposes <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/moral-obligation-coupons/">Moral Obligation Coupons</a>.  OK so that&#8217;s just one of the best minds, but he has a very good mind.</p>
<p>2) Everyone proposes minting a <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/be-ready-to-mint-that-coin/">$ trillion Platinum coin</a> including Josh Non Ricardian Equivalence Barro.  I&#8217;d just add that the coin should be made now and Obama should carry it in his pocket when <strike>negotiating </strike>uh refusing to negotiate so he can pull it out and threaten to tell Geithner to declare it worth $ trillion.</p>
<p>3) It&#8217;s Greek to me.  Look over here we are very expert in borrowing without issuing debt.  How do you think Greece managed to get so deep in debt ?     The trick (<a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/step-aside-greece-how-gustavo-piga-exposed-europes-enron-2001-focusing-italys-libor-minus-16">described by my colleague Gustavo Piga</a>) is to make a very bad speculative bet.  Greece (following a country which will remain nameless) made REPO deals with banks involving currency exchange &#8212; the bank gave Greece a great deal on the spot market and Greece gave the banks a great deal on the forward market.  In effect the deal consisted of an actual arms length market priced speculative position and a loan.  But since they were officially linked, it was not 100% certain that Greece would be paying the banks when the futures contract matured.  So by only for governments allowed accounting practices, Greece had not issued debt.</p>
<p>I think it would be best to explain exactly what is being done and how failure to raise the debt limit could cause the US to act like Greece this March.</p>
<p>4) Preferred shares.  OK this is close to 1.  Preferred shares are not debt. The whole key to TARP was that preferred shares are not debt.  Government agencies can issue preferred shares and the Fed can buy them.</p>
<p>5) Gagnon style.  heyyyy what about just good ol Fannie and Freddie ?  IIRC They are only 85% owned by the Federal Government exactly so that their debt does not appear as Federal debt.  86% and the balance sheets would have to be unified.  They owe the Treasury a lot of money.  They can issue debt instruments which the Fed can buy for an absurdly high price.  They can repay their debt to the Treasury.  Now they would have to have something to sell (say absurdly over priced MBS so it would be Gagnon style QE too).  Of course dealing with DeMarco might make dealing with Republicans in Congress seem easy.</p>
<p>6) If potential US Treasury default isn&#8217;t a financial crisis, I don&#8217;t know what is.  The Fed can lend to any entity during a financial crisis.  I think they could make 0 interest loans to federal contractors to be repaid when the Treasury pays them in exchange for their not billing the government.</p>
<p>7) Ask the big banks for a bailout.  What goes around comes around.  We saved them when they were in trouble.  They can give money to the US Treasury.  These are moral obligation coupons again.  They can demand limits on, say, compensation of Congress persons as part of the deal ala TARP.</p>
