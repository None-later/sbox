                                <p>I’m a political junkie, born and bred.  And so the number of political opinion pieces I’ve read in my life, dating back to my teenage years (me being a child of my parents, they of the ardent liberal Democrat variety&#8211; “Oh, no, Bevy!  You have to return that purse.  That company is anti-union!”  “Okayyy, Mom.”)&#8211;run probably into the thousands.  (Yikes.)  </p>
<p>And I’ve certainly read, ah-hem, a few pieces by established, mainstream columnists in respected newspapers and magazines that have made my eyes roll or made me shake my head in dismay because of some obvious flaw in logic or some clearly false representation of fact upon which the writer’s premise lies.  </p>
<p>But I don’t think I’ve ever before read such a mystifyingly wacky, whiplash-inducing, incomprehensibly-false-fact-based commentary as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/brooks-the-collective-turn.html?_r=0">the one I just read</a>, by David Brooks, in today&#8217;s New York Times.  The premise: That Obama’s argument for returning the federal government’s domestic-policy emphasis to trying to increase economic and social mobility, improving public infrastructure, encouraging individual creativity, inventiveness and risk-taking, and trying to help limit climate change, Obama was arguing for … you guessed it! (at least if you read Brooks’s columns even occasionally, as I do) … European-style central-government control (commands from “headquarters”; seriously) over the private sector and the private sector’s creativeness and innovativeness.  </p>
<p>No, sir!  Wouldn’t want any of that socialist German-style engineering expertise to make its way across the Atlantic. Especially since all those engineers at, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens">Siemens</a> got their engineering degrees at &#8212; and this is really dangerous&#8211;places like the University of Heidelberg!  Which is, OMG, a public university!  Supported by German taxes.  And financially accessible by some students whose families are not upscale!</p>
<p>Yup.  And that engineering and computer science school at the University of Illinois, regularly rated among the top such programs in the country, can’t possibly have produced someone who, say, while attending the school, developed the World Wide Web by developing the first Internet browser, called Mosaic, which became Netscape.  Uh-uh.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> only thinks his college memories of life in Champaign, Ill. But they’re really of life in Palo Alto.  Or maybe Cambridge, Mass.  And how did that Wisconsin native even manage to invent anything at all, given the “hammock” (Paul Ryan’s term, not Brooks’s) he found himself in when he (probably) took out a low-interest, no-repayments-required-until-five-years-after-graduation loan to pay that out-of-state tuition back in the late 1980s, and early 1990s, under a federal Great Society program? </p>
<p>The whiplash-inducing stuff in Brooks’s column appears at two points. The first one comes about midway through the column, when Brooks switches from praising the Obama speech as a strong argument for collective government policies to, say, assist in economic and social mobility.  The second one comes late in the column, after paragraphs in which he says such things as that we have a much more dynamic and innovative private sector than does Europe because colleges and universities in the Unites States are private rather than public and Europe’s are public rather than private (I’m not joking or exaggerating; he says this), and that the programs Obama supports, such as student loan programs and financial support for schools and medical and scientific research and the like, are attempts by political progressives to undermine private enterprise and control the private sector from Washington.  He then concedes, apparently unwittingly&#8211;he seems unaware, at least, of the irony&#8211;that public programs and financial regulations can (and do!) assist creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>You really have to read the whole column to get the full flavor.  Just put on a neck brace first.</p>
<p>And while you’re reading it, remind yourself that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell">Alexander Graham Bel</a>l, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_">Henry Ford</a> did not attend a private college.  Nor did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi">Enrico Fermi </a>or some of the other great physicists who emigrated to this country in the late 1930s after receiving their education at public universities&#8211;in Europe!  </p>
<p>And that David Brooks did attend a private university: the University of Chicago.  And that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brooks_(journalist)">his Philadelphia Main Line parents </a>probably paid his tuition and room and board, free and clear.</p>
<p>Enough said. I think.  Unless of course he’s invented something that I don’t know of.  And that’s useful. </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*PS: Indulge me in my obsession with idiocy from big-name, mainstream political pundits, writing in (or on) prestigious, widely read political-commentary forums.  Neither David Brooks <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">nor Dana Milba</a><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">nk</a> is, after all, all that important, I recognize.  But Brooks, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/he-asked-not-what-his-country-can-do.html">if not Milbank</a>, flatly crossed the line into misrepresentation of fact in a way that is really beyond the pale. And no one but me probably even noticed.  </p>
<p>Frustrating. </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />ANOTHER PS: As I said in response to a comment in the Comments thread, Brooks’s longtime shtick is anti-European&#8211;as in, Europe’s standard of living is lower than ours and that’s because their socialist policies deter creativity and innovation and therefore “dynamism.” He’s apparently run out of plausible-sounding arguments to support his belief, so he just blathers the claim incoherently, as needed.</p>

Its a pretty good list.</p>

<p>His thoughts on what is more mainstream caught my fancy as well. Angry Bear has developed a solid readership since 2003, but economic blogs were anything but mainstream even six/seven years ago, and are common to major media outlets now. September 2008 brought a big jump in readership to most of the econoblog world. But which are closer to mainstream?  And how does that impact what is covered?  Who is the audience today?  Worth pondering. </p>

<p> Dell&#8217;s Offshored Cash Hoard and Fair Taxes</p>
<p> As most people who follow mergers, acquisitions and other mega transactions are likely aware, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dell">Michael Dell</a> wants to take the company he founded private in a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leveraged_buyout">leveraged buyout</a>. LBOs, of course, use the company&#8217;s own assets as collateral for debt to purchase the company&#8211;one of the types of financial alchemy that has contributed to the last thirty years of corporate consolidations and elite wealth accumulation, both of which are problematic for sustainable economies and sustainable democracies. </p>
<p>Michael Dell has a particularly interesting &#8220;problem&#8221;. Like most high-technology companies, Dell has avoided a lot of US tax by offshoring and claiming its profits in offshore tax havens rather than in the US. So it has more than $14 billion of highly liquid assets in offshore affiliates and not here. See Zahary Mider and Jesse Drucker, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-18/dell-leveraged-buyout-may-hinge-on-cash-hoard-outside-u-s-.html">Dell Leveraged Buyout May Hinge on Cash Hoard Outside US</a>, Bloomberg.com (Jan. 18, 2013).</p>
<p>We shouldn&#8217;t allow that, but fixing it would require real corporate tax reform, not the stuff that commissions and Congress blather on about most of the time, like &#8220;lowering tax rates&#8221; and &#8220;simplifying the tax code&#8221;, both of which are nonsensical when it comes to corporate multinationals who pay incredibly low <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate">effective tax rates</a> already and who will use any &#8220;simplification&#8221; as just another inviation to exercise their sophisticated tax skills at manipulating the Code for their private tax advantage. </p>
<p>Congress of course hasn&#8217;t had the gumption to take on Big IT for years.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>And under the Bush Administration, when Congress and the Treasury seemed to be motivated primarily by seeing how fast they could give away tax breaks to corporate business through the tax code, Congress enacted one of its most foolhardy tax expenditures that especially benefited corporations that had been &#8220;bad&#8221; tax citizens&#8211;the 2004 misnamed &#8220;American Jobs Creation Act&#8221; that allowed the bad companies that had offshored their profits to avoid tax the indulgence of bringing those untaxed profits home at what amounted to no or negative tax rates&#8211;the so-called &#8220;repatriation holiday&#8221; provision. As usual, the right-wing claimed that these corporate tax breaks would create jobs. They didn&#8217;t (as shown by Bush&#8217;s dismal job creation record, even before the onset of the great Recession). Instead, they were used for corporate stock buybacks and similar goodies for those investors who are mostly the wealthy upper-class who own most of the corporate assets. So the repatriation tax holiday exemplified the problems of the corporatist agenda and the way it exacerbates inequality, a kind of class warfare in bits and increments. </p>
<p>So we can expect a new onslaught of lobbying by companies like Dell for another extraordinarily wasteful &#8220;repatriation holiday.&#8221; The lobbyists will claim that such corporate tax cuts are essential if we want big companies to keep creating jobs. But that&#8217;s bunk. The evidence is in from the last repatriation holidy&#8211;it lined the pockets of the rich, as most of these corporate tax breaks have done and did not create jobs.</p>
<p>Obama and the Democrats in Congress should resist. Ordinary Americans should not bear the burden of ordinary income rates when the wealthy are taxed at preferential capital gains rates. And ordinary Americans surely shouldn&#8217;t be called upon yet again to subsidize profit-making corporation&#8217;s low-tax regimes through the cuts ordinary Americans will suffer to needed services. </p>

<div dir="ltr">There was less wow in the address that preceded [singer Kelly] Clarkson. Obama teased the crowd with a theme of unity: “Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people.” But his “we the people” theme turned out to be more of a campaign retread. “We the people understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,” he said. “We reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.”</div>
<div dir="ltr">And we the people accept that we live in an era of diminished oratory.</div>

<p>Yes, and we the people also accept that some high-profile, highly-paid, political pundits make careers out of confusing vapidity with statesmanship.  And oratory with substance. </p>
<p>And rote, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-president-congeniality-talks-tough/2013/01/14/6f5b50a0-5e9d-11e2-90a0-73c8343c6d61_print.html">formulaic</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/apparently-national-reviews-editors.html">nonsense</a> with analysis. </p>
<p>Ask not what your political pundit can do for your understanding of substantive policy issues and politics&#8211;ask what you can do for your political pundit’s logic compass.  Which I think is to stop reading his column. </p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I end up posting this, I believe, every year.  And every year, despite not trying at all, I find a newer and better reason to post it.  This year, it&#8217;s because cities in Virginia, including Harrisonburg City, have their students in school today—a Federal holiday—but made damned certain the kids were out on Friday for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee%E2%80%93Jackson_Day">[Robert E.]Lee-[Stonewall]Jackson Day</a>.  If Barack Obama deserves to reign in Hell over one thing alone, it is because he took locally-popular Democrats like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Sibelius">Kathleen</a> &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203413304577084560710472558.html">I&#8217;m incompetent, so I will overrule the scientists</a>&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Sibelius">Sibelius</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janet_Napolitano">Janet Napolitano</a> and moved them to DC, weakening the strength of his own Party and (worse) having those Governors replaced by people who make life worse for his constituents in Sam Brownback and Jan Brewer.  Jan Brewer probably isn&#8217;t as bad as Evan Meacham, but that&#8217;s the best anyone has said. Bob McDonnell at least <a href="http://www.governor.virginia.gov/News/viewRelease.cfm?id=1620">proclaimed today Martin Luther King, Jr., Day</a>,* even if the kids don&#8217;t get it off, the way they do for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Fredericksburg">real heroes of his state</a>. </p>
</p>
<p>*It would be petty of me to note that McDonnell&#8217;s proclamation conspicuously leaves the &#8220;Dr.&#8221; off the front of Doctor Martin Luther King, Jr.  I guess a Ph.D. from Boston University isn&#8217;t worth all that much.</p>

<div dir="ltr">What a spot-on article Run 75441’s piece, “<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/healthcare-reform-socialism-or-fascism.html">Healthcare Reform; Socialism or Fascism?</a>” is. And what an informative Comments thread.  (Wow, Cynthia, who knew? I sure didn’t.) </div>

<p>
<div dir="ltr">But I have my own suggestion to Mackey: Consider expanding your company to other countries. Australia, maybe.  Germany.  Canada.  Sweden. France. Britain.  Norway.  Holland.  Maybe even Israel and Poland, both of them countries whose healthcare system Mitt Romney praised last summer.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Or maybe Switzerland, where&#8211;as another reader commented in the earlier thread, in noting your praise of the Swiss health system, Mr. Mackey&#8211;you can see a fascist (or is it a socialist?) system at work, while admiring the beautiful mountainscape and maybe even skiing in it.</div>

                                <p>This was a throw-down-the-gauntlet speech.  </p>
<p>We have ourselves a leader.  </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE: E.J. Dionne <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2013/01/21/obamas-unapologetic-inaugural-address/?hpid=z4">equates this speech</a> with FDR&#8217;s second inaugural speech and Reagan&#8217;s first one, in its importance.  I hadn&#8217;t thought of Reagan&#8217;s&#8211;and of course the substance of today&#8217;s speech was the mirror image, the opposite, of Reagan&#8217;s&#8211;and I wasn&#8217;t alive for any of FDR&#8217;s speeches.  But my very first reaction to the speech today was to think that it probably was similar in its essence to FDR&#8217;s 1937 inaugural speech.  Just an instinct, but apparently I was right. </p>
<p>PS: Also, be sure not to miss Greg Sargent&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/21/an-expansive-case-for-progressive-governance-grounded-in-language-of-founding-fathers/">specific comparison </a>of the speech to FDR&#8217;s second inaugural one.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s happening, folks.  It&#8217;s finally happening. It&#8217;s finally our turn.</p>

<p> Healthcare Reform; Socialism or Fascism?</p>
<p>Whole Foods CEO John Mackey in 2009 originally called President Obama&#8217;s healthcare plan a form of Socialism while writing an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;The problem with socialism is that eventually you run out of other people&#8217;s money.&#8221;</i> <i>Margaret</i> <i>Thatcher&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p>and added to Thatcher&#8217;s statement:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;While we clearly need health-care reform, the last thing our country needs is a massive new health-care entitlement that will create hundreds of billions of dollars of new unfunded deficits and move us much closer to a government takeover of our health-care system,&#8221; he wrote.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>Mackey joins other CEO&#8217;s (Papa Johns, Olive Garden, Applebees, etc.) (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/12/raising-price-of-pizza-10-to-14-cents.html"><i>Raising the Cost of Pizza 10 to 14 cents</i></a>); who refuse to understand the need for healthcare reform, support a commercial healthcare insurance and industry solution even though both have done little to voluntarily rein in costs, are willing to penalize their employees for the PPACA, and ignore the results of doing nothing and associated increased costs. Since Hillarycare (1994), the industry has ignored increasing costs and has not provided solutions to mitigate them. As shown in Figure 1 annual healthcare cost has grown much faster than inflation. Figure 4 shows the increase in House hold expenditures since 1994 when Hillarycare was considered.<i></i></p>

<p>Recently during an NPR interview, John Mackey changed his opinion calling the PPACA fascism instead of Socialism:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;Technically speaking, it&#8217;s more like fascism. Socialism is where the government owns the means of production. In fascism, the government doesn&#8217;t own the means of production, but they do control it — and that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening with our health care programs and these reforms.&#8221; </i><a href="http://www.newsmax.com/TheWire/whole-foods-obamacare-facist-socialist/2013/01/16/id/471765">Obamacare Is Fascist, Not Socialist</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In a short period after labeling the PPACA as fascism, John Mackey reconsiders his words after a public uproar and retracted his name-calling of President Obama as a fascist and the PPACA as fascism. All of this from a Liberal now turned Libertarian.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>The term fascism today stirs up too much negative emotion with its horrific associations in the 20th century,&#8221; he said.</i> </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;I believe that, if the goal is universal health care, our country would be far better served by combining free enterprise capitalism with a strong governmental safety net for our poorest citizens and those with preexisting conditions, helping everyone to be able to buy insurance. This is what Switzerland does and I think we would be much better off copying that system than where we are currently headed in the United States.</i>&#8221; <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/business/whole-foods-ceo-regrets-comparing-obamacare-fascism-1B8022914">Whole Foods CEO Regrets . . .&#8221;</a></p></blockquote>
<p>It has only been since the passage of the PPACA (see S&#038;P Healthcare Indices) has the healthcare industry begun to rein in costs as reflected in Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHPS through efficiencies. Much of this is due to the healthcare industry rapidly preparing for the 2014 final implementation of the PPACA. More will come after 2014.</p>
<p>You would think this would be enough? At the same time, the Republicans are calling for cuts to the three programs to lower deficit spending; the President is offering to consider modest cuts and shows willingness to sell-out the citizens to achieve his Grand Deal. Cuts in any of the programs will do nothing to lower healthcare industry cost as these programs are a reflection of the industry. In the end, such a Grand Deal will lay the burden of healthcare costs on the elderly, the poor and the children of this nation. The &#8220;I Made This&#8221; John Mackeys of the world who became rich as a result his customers buying from Whole Foods will absolve themselves of any social responsibility.</p>

<p>Wrong v. Mark Steyn Wrong</p>
<p>Every so often I come across one or another columnist or tv personality making some</p>
<p>Steyn&#8217;s latest!  ( <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/337490/obamacare-s-other-shoe-mark-steyn">Mark Steyn</a> )<br />
<blockquote>If you had buttonholed me in the Senate men’s room circa 2003 and told me that a decade hence Joe Biden would be America’s vice president, John Kerry secretary of state, and Chuck Hagel secretary of defense, I’d have laughed and waited for the punch line</p></blockquote>
<p>I get it.  Steyn is telling us his powers of prognostication are very poor.  Its commendable, albeit odd, of him to warn his readers, but we should check to make sure it is more than false modesty on his part. Since  he discusses his forecasts circa 2003, let&#8217;s check that out. What was he writing circa 2003?  This <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3589977/Movers-and-shakers-have-moved-on-to-the-next-disaster.html">article</a> is one of the first things that comes up in a Google search of Mark Steyn&#8217;s writings from 2003, and the first with any forecasts.  It begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>On to the next quagmire! Don&#8217;t get mired in the bog of yesterday&#8217;s conventional wisdom, when the movers and shakers have already moved on to new disasters. America may have won the war but it&#8217;s already losing the peace! Here&#8217;s your at-a-glance guide to what the experts who got everything wrong last week will be getting wrong next week</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds promising, doesn&#8217;t it?   Here is his first point:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Iraq&#8217;s slide into violent anarchy&#8221; (Guardian, April 11). Say what you like about Saddam, but he ran a tight ship and you didn&#8217;t have to nail down your nest of tables: since the Brits took over, Basra&#8217;s property crime is heading in an alarmingly Cheltenhamesque direction. MBITRW (Meanwhile Back In The Real World): A year from now, Basra will have a lower crime rate than most London boroughs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s see&#8230; a year and nine days after this article appeared, a series of car bombs went off in Basra.  74 people were killed, over 100 injured.  Just like the East End, Mark Steyn might say.  And since we&#8217;re talking about the British, here are a few entries from a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14546763">BBC</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-14546763">timeline</a> looking at the rest of the country:</p>
<blockquote><p>2004 March &#8211; Suicide bombers attack Shia festival-goers in<br />Karbala and Baghdad, killing 140 people.</p>
<p>2004 April-May &#8211; Shia militias loyal to radical cleric Moqtada Sadr<br />take on coalition forces.</p>
<p>Hundreds are reported killed in fighting during the month-long US military siege of the Sunni Muslim city of Falluja.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But back to Basra, and a story in the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/06/AR2007080601401.html">Washington</a> <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/06/AR2007080601401.html">Post some years later</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But &#8220;it&#8217;s hard now to paint Basra as a success story,&#8221; said a senior U.S. official in Baghdad with long experience in the south. Instead, it has become a different model, one that U.S. officials with experience in the region are concerned will be<br />replicated throughout the Iraqi Shiite homeland from Baghdad to the Persian Gulf. A recent series of war games commissioned by the Pentagon also warned of civil war among Shiites after a reduction in U.S. forces.</p>
<p>For the past four years, the administration&#8217;s narrative of the Iraq war has centered on al-Qaeda, Iran and the sectarian violence they have promoted. But in the homogenous south &#8212; where there are virtually no U.S. troops or al-Qaeda fighters, few Sunnis, and by most accounts limited influence by Iran &#8212; Shiite militias fight one another as well as British troops. A British strategy launched last fall to reclaim Basra neighborhoods from violent actors &#8212; similar to the current U.S. strategy in Baghdad &#8212; brought no lasting success.</p>
<p>&#8220;The British have basically been defeated in the south,&#8221; a senior U.S. intelligence official said recently in Baghdad. They are abandoning their former headquarters at Basra Palace, where a recent official visitor from London described them as &#8220;surrounded like cowboys and Indians&#8221; by militia fighters. An airport base outside the city, where a regional U.S. Embassy office and Britain&#8217;s remaining 5,500 troops<br />are barricaded behind building-high sandbags, has been attacked with mortars or rockets nearly 600 times over the past four months.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I think we can safely say that either Steyn is woefully ignorant of British crime statistics, or we can safely say his first forecast in his article was spectacularly wrong.</p>
<p>Steyn moved on:</p>
<blockquote><p>2) &#8220;The head of the World Food Programme has warned thatIraq could spiral into a massive humanitarian disaster&#8221; (Australian, April 11). MBITRW: No such disaster will occur, any more than it did during the mythical &#8220;brutal Afghan winter&#8221; and its attendant humanitarian scaremongering. </p></blockquote>
<p>Steyn must have been disappointed that the <a href="http://www.who.int/disasters/repo/15107.pdf">World Health Organization was still &#8220;scaremongering&#8221; a year later</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Insufficient food intake endangers the  nutritional status of a large part of the population increasing morbidity and mortality due to communicable diseases. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.who.int/hac/crises/irq/background/Iraq_Health_in_Iraq_second_edition.pdf">A lot</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As indicated before, the situation of food safety seems to be serious. In three quarters of districts, the local manufactured food stuff did not meet the standard specifications. In more than half of the districts there were imported food products which were considered unfit for human consumption. A survey conducted, by the<br />MOH, on food processing factories revealed that only 58% complied with food safety regulations.</p></blockquote>
<p>And perhaps you remember <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;cad=rja&#038;ved=0CDIQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2004%2FWORLD%2Fmeast%2F04%2F01%2Firaq.contractor%2F&#038;ei=RZz6UMDEG-We2wX96oD4BQ&#038;usg=AFQjCNGqH40IjcUws2SUXJuU-mnu-3mvrw&#038;sig2=5yEp_CcX4GIv8KRj0oR1XQ&#038;bvm=bv.41248874,d.aWM">this story</a>  from 2004:</p>
<blockquote><p>Blackwater Security Consulting &#8212; whose four employees were viciously killed and their corpses mutilated by a mob in Fallujah, Iraq &#8212; is one of a growing number of private security contractors that are hiring veterans for jobs previously assigned to<br />the military.</p>
<p>Those jobs include the protection of personnel working for private companies and non-government organizations in Iraq.</p>
<p>They provide very focused security for detailing out how a protectee&#8217;s day occurs &#8212; from the beginning of the morning until they tuck that person back into bed at night,&#8221; said CNN national security analyst Ken Robinson, &#8220;whether that be an NGO trying to conduct operations trying to provide food or water or support to the<br />population.</p>
<p>The four men killed Wednesday were providing security for a convoy delivering U.S. government food.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus combining Steyn&#8217;s predictions 1 and 2 together in a medley of wrongness.</p>
<p>As a bonus, Steyn mentioned the food situation in Afghanistan. Clearly when he wrote this piece, he didn&#8217;t realize there are different kinds of predictions.  One type involves absolute statements:  &#8220;X will happen&#8221; or &#8220;Y will not happen.&#8221;  Examples<br />include:  &#8220;A year from now, Basra will have a lower crime rate than most London boroughs&#8221; or &#8220;No such disaster will occur.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then there are statements that call for action, that either flat out state or imply &#8220;If we don&#8217;t act, then Z.&#8221;  I&#8217;m guessing the World Food Program&#8217;s worries about the food situation in Afghanistan fall under the latter category.  Here&#8217;s a story from <a href="http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=23200#.UPfaySfEyVo">2007</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>WFP aims to supply over half a million metric tons of food<br />to 6.6 million people in Afghanistan yearly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps this is also just like London&#8217;s East End in Steyn&#8217;s version of reality.  And it seems that a decade later, the World Food Program is <a href="http://www.wfp.org/stories/preparing-winter-wfp-distributes-food-afghan-mountain-villages">still delivering food to Afghanistan.</a></p>
<p>So where are we at?  2 forecasts thus far, of which 2.5 of them wrong. (Yes, I do think he deserves to be dinged for the bit about Afghanistan.)</p>
<p>Steyn continued:</p>
<blockquote><p>3) &#8220;Iraqis Now Waiting for Americans to Leave&#8221; (AP, April 10). MBITRW: There will be terrible acts of suicide-bomber depravity in the months ahead, but no widespread resentment at or resistance of the Western military presence.</p></blockquote>
<p>A year later, though, the situation looked like <a href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2004-04-28-poll-cover_x.htm">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>But while they acknowledge benefits from dumping Saddam a year ago, Iraqis no longer see the presence of the American-led military as a plus. Asked whether they view the U.S.-led coalition as &#8220;liberators&#8221; or &#8220;occupiers,&#8221; 71% of all respondents say &#8220;occupiers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>No doubt to Steyn, the Iraqis meant &#8220;occupiers&#8221; in a positive way.<br />With ponies.  And unicorns.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s more:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the multiethnic Baghdad area, where a Gallup Poll last summer of 1,178 residents permits a valid comparison, only 13% of the people now say the invasion of Iraq was morally justifiable. In the 2003 poll, more than twice that number saw it as the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Americans regard their men and women in uniform as liberators who are trying to help Iraq. But the Iraqis now see them as a threat and focus their anger on them.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they pass by on the street, we are curious, so we go out to look and they immediately point their gun at you,&#8221; says Muia, the bicycle shop owner.</p>
<p>Except for the Kurds, such feelings are widely held. For example:</p>
<p>Two-thirds say soldiers in the U.S.-led coalition make no attempt to keep ordinary Iraqis from being killed or wounded during exchanges of gunfire.</p>
<p>58% say the soldiers conduct themselves badly or very badly.</p>
<p>60% say the troops show disrespect for Iraqi people in searches of their homes, and 42% say U.S. forces have shown disrespect toward mosques.</p>
<p>46% say the soldiers show a lack of respect for Iraqi women.</p>
<p>Only 11% of Iraqis say coalition forces are trying hard to restore basic services such as electricity and clean drinking water.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our talley on Steyn&#8217;s forecasts:  3 forecasts made, 3.5 big forecasting errors.</p>
<p>Steyn&#8217;s next forecast reads like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>4) &#8220;If Saddam is not found dead, or caught alive, it will be the worst of all possible closures for the war against Iraq. Bin Laden himself continues to elude capture&#8221; (Roland Flamini, UPI) MBITRW: Obviously, it would be preferable if the late Saddam&#8217;s future media appearances were confined to guest-hosting Good Morning, Hell! with Osama. But if he&#8217;s reduced to bin Laden&#8217;s current schedule &#8211; mailing in bi-monthly audio cassettes of Islamist boilerplate &#8211; what&#8217;s the difference? Even if he&#8217;d escaped to Syria, he&#8217;d be spending the rest of his days as a Bedouin goat-herd. Right now, Boy Assad is doing his best not to attract Rummy&#8217;s attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>Steyn gets this one right &#8211; Saddam didn&#8217;t play much of a role from that point forward.</p>
<p>So, four forecasts, 3.5 errors, 1 successful forecast.</p>
<p>Moving on to Steyn&#8217;s next forecast:</p>
<blockquote><p>5) &#8220;Iraq was a new country cobbled together from several former Ottoman provinces, its lines drawn by the Europeans&#8221; (Mark Mazower, Independent, April 7). It&#8217;s a phony state, you can never make a go of it. MBITRW: There&#8217;s nothing in the least bit &#8220;cobbled&#8221; about it. The three Ottoman vilayets of Mosul, Baghdad and Basra have been<br />bound together by geography and trade for millennia. As a coherent jurisdiction, it makes more sense than, say, Belgium. As long as you respect its inherently confederal nature, it&#8217;ll work fine: think St Kitts and Nevis writ large.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I understand it, the Iraqi constitution allows Iraqi Kurdistan to maintain its own military forces (the Peshmerga) and does not allow the military from the rest of Iraq to operate in Kurdish territory. So far, so &#8220;confederal&#8221; to quote Steyn.  But ten years on, there are still <a href="http://www.defence.pk/forums/arab-defence/220273-peshmerga-iraqi-army-clash-12-iraqi-soldiers-died.html">armed clashes between Kurdish and Iraqi forces with people getting killed</a>.  Sometimes they&#8217;re <a href="http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/politics/2012/11/iraqi-kurdish-army-clashes-end-but-tensions-remain-high.html">&#8220;misunderstandings&#8221;</a>, sometimes they&#8217;re territorial grabs, but one thing is certain:  the two forces remain <a href="http://www.rudaw.net/english/kurds/5011.html">eyeball to eyeball.</a></p>
<p>This is less St. Kitts and Nevis than Pakistan and India during a<br />particularly hot period.</p>
<p>Score &#8211; 5 forecasts, 4.5 errors, 1 success.</p>
<p>Steyn&#8217;s error roll rolls on:</p>
<blockquote><p>6) &#8220;Turkey is concerned that a Kurdish capture of Kirkuk could help bankroll moves to establish an independent Kurdistan&#8221; (AFP, April 9). MBITRW: Nothing to worry about. The Kurds are the only part of the indigenous population that were part of the liberation force from the start. They&#8217;re not going anywhere now. They&#8217;ll settle for<br />being Scotland or Quebec rather than Pakistan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Back to the whole &#8220;Kurdish forces clashing with the Iraqi military thing.&#8221; Unless things have picked up in Scotland or Quebec, Steyn gets this one wrong.  But I&#8217;ll give him half a point on a technicality &#8211; the Turks aren&#8217;t all that concerned that the Iraqi Kurds are formenting revolt in Turkish Kurdistan right now, largely because of the Iraqi Kurdish stand-off with the Iraqi military.  Actually, even that&#8217;s not true &#8211; here&#8217;s a story from <a href="http://www.almonitor.com/pulse/security/01/10/iraq-ejects-turkish-armed-forces.html">late 2011</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Already tense relations between Turkey and the Iraqi central government have now become critical following a decision made by Baghdad. Following the Turkish government’s request for parliamentary approval of cross-border operations by the Turkish military, Baghdad has decided to not to allow the Turkish army to enter Northern Iraq and to maintain its presence there.</p>
<p>In a meeting yesterday [Oct. 2], the Iraqi cabinet decided to annul all agreements that enabled the presence of foreign troops in Iraq. The decision will directly affect Turkey, which has been maintaining bases in Northern Iraq since the 1990s. Iraqi government spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh announced the move: “The government has decided to refuse the presence of foreign troops and bases on Iraqi soil. No foreign soldiers will be allowed to enter Iraqi territory. The government has advised the parliament to annul existing agreements and not to extend them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And how&#8217;s that going now?  Well, <a href="http://www.al%20monitor.com/pulse/politics/2012/10/kurds-reject-malikis-demand-to-control-pesherga-militia.html">the Turks are still there</a> (and the Iraqis are still at it with the<br />Kurds):</p>
<blockquote><p>Maliki described the objections to the formation of the Tigris Operations Command as “unconstitutional, because the federal army has the right to have a presence in Basra or Zakho, and no one has the right to prevent it constitutionally. There are implicit<br />intentions and a lack of desire for the federal authority to have control or a presence.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said that the army “is more [entitled] than the Turkish troops to have a presence [in Iraq’s Kurdish region].”</p></blockquote>
<p>So giving half a point to Steyn and marking half a point against him is exceedingly generous,</p>
<p>That&#8217;s six forecasts, 5 errors, 1.5 successes.</p>
<p>Next:</p>
<blockquote><p>7) &#8220;Rather than reforming the Muslim world, the conquest of Iraq will inflame it&#8221; (Jeffrey Simpson, Toronto Globe and Mail, April 10). MBITRW: Effective immediately, Palestinian suicide bombers are no longer subsidised by Baghdad; in Jordan, the Saddamite boot is off the Hashemite windpipe; Syria is under notice to behave. Despite the best efforts of Western doom-mongers to rouse the Arab street, its attitude will remain: start the jihad without me.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one he got right.  The Arab Spring came way later.</p>
<p>Seven forecasts, 5 errors, 2.5 successes.</p>
<blockquote><p>8) &#8220;Looting is always unsavoury. Let&#8217;s hope the Americans don&#8217;t pilfer the oil&#8221; (Brenda Linane, Age of Melbourne, April 11). MBITRW: The pilfering of Iraq&#8217;s oil has just ended. Saddam parcelled his country&#8217;s wealth out to those companies willing to cosy up to him. The oil business will now be opened up to competitive tender. The only North American politician with a personal stake in any of this is not Bush, Cheney or any of their Texan oilpatch pals, but the Prime Minister of Canada, whose daughter is married to TotalFinaElf&#8217;s biggest shareholder. The liberation of Iraq is a victory for real markets over French cronyism.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not sure anyone can know enough about the oil situation right now, except to say that the Kurds seem to be signing their own deals with oil companies which the Iraqi central government say is illegal. Depending on how one looks that, it could be &#8220;pilfering&#8221; or not.  I&#8217;ll give that one to Steyn rather than get into the weeds.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s eight forecasts, 5 errors, 3.5 successes.</p>
<p>Continuing.</p>
<blockquote><p>9) &#8220;Weapons of Mass Destruction. Remember them? Not a single one has yet been found&#8221; (Bill Neely, ITV, April 10). MBITRW: Actually, I almost wish this one were true. Anything that turns up now will be assumed to have been planted. If I were Washington, I&#8217;d consider burying anything I found. After all, an America that feels no need to bother faking justifications for invasion would be far more alarming to most Europeans. Instead, horrible things will turn up, but will never be &#8220;conclusive&#8221; enough for the French, who&#8217;ve got all the receipts anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not even sure what this means.  Best I can say, the &#8220;I almost wish this one were true&#8221; means Steyn feels WMDs were found.  I think we have to ding him for it.</p>
<p>With nine forecasts, he has 6 errors and 3.5 successes.</p>
<p>Saving the best for last, Steyn tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>10) America is already losing the peace. MBITRW: In a year&#8217;s time, Iraq will be, at a bare minimum, the least badly governed state in the Arab world and, at best, pleasant, civilised and thriving. In short: not a bad three weeks&#8217; work.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the painted schoolhouses, I think even Steyn would admit this one was wrong putting him at 7 bad forecasts, 3.5 good forecasts.  Two bad forecasts for every good one.  Random guesses would have seriously outperformed the forecasts he made with such smug assurance on a topic on which, judging from Google,  Mr. Steyn felt qualified to expend a lot of ink.  And, don&#8217;t forget, we began with his admission that his ability to guess what is likely to happen in the US is completely off too.</p>
<p>Which raises the question &#8211; Steyn is a popular, very well paid columnist.  Is there anything on which he has pontificated in the past on which he&#8217;s been proven largely right?</p>
