<blockquote><p>Even though, for most people, the housing crisis is a thing of the past, the fight over who should bear the cost of sloppy and openly fraudulent mortgage origination and securities sales continues to grind through the courts.</p>
<p>We’ve written now and again about mortgage putback cases, which are also called representation and warranty, or “rep and warranty” litigation. Investors in mortgage-backed securities were not quite as dumb as the crisis aftermath had made them look. The sponsors of the securitizations made promises in the offering documents (called representations and warranties) about the quality of the loans. It turns out they lied.</p>
<p>Normally, when a loan is found to be worse than the sponsors promised, the remedy is a putback. The originator is required to take the bad loan back and replace it, either with cash or buy replacing it with a loan that was of the quality that the investors were promised. However, the mortgage securitizations put hurdles in front of the investors: it took a minimum level of investors (usually 25%) to demand putbacks and it was hard for any investor to know who else had bought a particular deal. Even then, the trustee (who was the party who was responsible for putting back the loan) almost always ignored and fought investor putback requests. They have ongoing relationships with the sponsors, so they don’t want to ruffle big meal tickets, plus the margins for acting as a mortgage securitization trustee are thin, so they don’t lift a finger unless they absolutely have to&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>But if the city and its residents are desperate to keep the Coyotes in town, they have to understand that doing so comes at a cost that likely won&#8217;t be replaced &#8212; not by sales tax revenue, not by economic growth, and not by outside spending. When the city subsidizes hockey, it reduces its ability to pay for public safety officials, public transportation, and services upon which its citizens rely.<br />That&#8217;s a choice the city is free to make, of course, but it shouldn&#8217;t pretend that the mere presence of the Coyotes is an economic investment. Doing so simply enables a further transfer of public dollars to a private enterprise, without much hope for a return.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suppose there is a difference between a corn field and a stadium, and I think Costner didn&#8217;t ask for special loans and tax status.   But a thrity year loan is not as flexible as jobs.</p>

<p>Oakland was no different, laying off 200 police officers, despite the city having the fifth-highest crime rate in the country. However, the city chose to fire those officers while <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-12-20/oakland-pays-17-million-for-nfl-raiders-as-cops-get-cut.html">preserving a $17 million payment</a> to the National Football League’s Oakland Raiders and Major League Baseball’s Oakland Athletics:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Oakland, California, the fifth-most crime ridden city in America, faced a $32 million budget deficit last year. It closed the gap by dismissing a fourth of its police force, more than 200 officers.</strong><br /><strong>Untouched was the $17.3 million that the city pays to stage 10 games a season for the National Football League’s Oakland Raiders and to host Major League Baseball’s Athletics in the O.co Coliseum.</strong> The funds cover debt financing and operations and are supplemented by $13.3 million from surrounding Alameda County, based on data compiled by Bloomberg from public records. </p></blockquote>

<p>Paul Krugman is Wrong about the Rise of the Robots  <a title="http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/paul-krugman-is-wrong-about-the-rise-of-the-robots/" href="http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/paul-krugman-is-wrong-about-the-rise-of-the-robots/">http://econfuture.wordpress.com/2013/01/18/paul-krugman-is-wrong-about-the-rise-of-the-robots/</a> </p>
<p>Paul Krugman has recently taken a keen interest in the rise of robots and automation — an issue that I have been focusing on since the publication of my book on this subject back in 2009.</p>
<p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/is-growth-over/">In a recent post</a>, Krugman says the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>Smart machines may make higher GDP possible, but also reduce the demand for people — including smart people. So we could be looking at a society that grows ever richer, but in which all the gains in wealth accrue to whoever owns the robots.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think there is a fundamental problem with this way of thinking: as jobs and incomes are relentlessly automated away, the bulk of consumers will lack the income necessary to drive the demand that is critical to economic growth.</p>
<p>Every product and service produced by the economy ultimately gets purchased (consumed) by someone. In economic terms, “demand” means a desire or need for something – backed by the ability and willingness to pay for it. There are only two entities that create final demand for products and services: individual people and governments. (And we know that government can’t be the demand solution in the long run). Individual consumer spending is typically around 70% of GDP in the United States.</p>
<p>Of course, businesses also purchase things, but that is NOT final demand. Businesses buy inputs that are used to produce something else. If there is no demand for what the business is producing, it will shut down and stop buying inputs. A business may sell to another business, but somewhere down the line, that chain has to end at a person (or a government) buying something just because they want it or need it.</p>
<p>This point here is that a worker is also a consumer (and may support other consumers). These people drive final demand. When a worker is replaced by a machine, that machine does not go out and consume. The machine may use energy, resources and spare parts, but again, those are business inputs—not final demand. If there is no one to buy what the machine is producing, it will get shut down. Think of on industrial robot being used by an auto manufacturer. The robot will not continue running if no one is buying cars.*</p>
<p>So if we automate all the jobs, or most of the jobs, or if we drive wages so low that very few people have any discretionary income, then it is difficult to see how a modern mass-market economy can continue to thrive. (This is the primary focus of my book, <em>The Lights in the Tunnel</em>).</p>
<p>There is plenty of evidence that consumers are already struggling with the structural shift occurring in the economy. The years leading up to the current economic crisis were, of course, characterized by people consuming on the basis of debt rather than income. <a href="http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2013/jan/15/more-workers-are-raiding-retirement-accounts-to/">A just-released report</a> shows that an ever increasing number of Americans are raiding their retirement accounts to pay current bills.</p>
<p>Does Paul Krugman really believe that it is possible to have a “society that grows ever richer” while a tiny number of robot owners hoover up more and more of total income — and the jobless masses consume the output by running up their credit cards or cashing in their 401(k)s?</p>
<p>The point is that the robot revolution is not just about income inequality. It will ultimately impact the sustainability of economic growth.</p>
<p>Innovation requires the existence of a market. New ideas will not receive the necessary backing if investors do not anticipate healthy market demand. A future with a dearth of viable consumers will be a far more zero-sum future. It will mean less of the type of innovation we associate with Steve Jobs — and more of the type you would find at Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>One of the main points I make in my book is that I think we will ultimately have to treat the market itself as a kind of renewable resource. Jobs and wages have historically been the primary mechanism that redistributes income (and purchasing power) from producers back to consumers. Widespread reliance on robots and automation may ultimately cause that mechanism to break down — and that will be a threat to continued prosperity.</p>
<p>So what is the solution? In the long run, I think there will be no alternative except to implement direct redistribution of income. One possibility is a guaranteed minimum income funded by more progressive taxes (on the robot owners), and possibly by other sources (for example, a carbon tax).</p>
<p>It goes without saying that implementing such a solution would be an enormous social and political challenge. And it will intertwine with the other major problems we face. Meaningful action on climate change, for example, will become even more difficult in world where much of the population is increasingly focused on individual income continuity.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, responding to the impact that accelerating technology has on the job market could turn out to be one of the defining challenges for our generation.</p>
<p>* Not all robots are used in production, of course. There are also consumer robots. If you own a toy robot, it may “consume” batteries. However, in economic terms, YOU are the consumer — not the robot. You need a job/income or you won’t be able to buy batteries for your robot. Robots do not drive final consumption — people do.</p>

                                <p>From <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2013/jan/15/east-coast-sandy-storms-obama-scientist">The Guardian</a> comes this news:</p>
<blockquote><p>Marcia McNutt, who last week announced her resignation as director of the US Geological Survey, told a conference that Sandy had left coastal communities dangerously exposed to future storms of any size.</p>
<p>&#8220;Superstorm Sandy was a threshold for the north-east and we have already crossed it,&#8221; McNutt told the National Council for Science and the Environment conference in Washington. &#8220;For the next storm, not even a super storm, even a run-of-the-mill nor&#8217;easter, the amount of breaches and the amount of coastal flooding will be widespread.&#8221;</p>
<p>McNutt, a professor of marine geophysics, was careful to preface her public remarks by saying she spoke as a scientist and not an Obama Administration official. But the unusually stark warning from a departing Obama official indicates the challenges ahead in protecting American population centres from the extreme storms of a changing climate.</p>
<p>&#8220;Before Sandy, someone asked me what my <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/scienceofclimatechange">climate change</a> nightmare was. Before Sandy, I said it was that with the extra energy in the atmosphere-ocean system it feeds super storms that intersect mega-cities left rendered defenceless by rising seas,&#8221; McNutt said in a brief interview following her public remarks. &#8220;That is where we now are.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>1) Reasonable and reasonably honest conservative list update: Josh Barro is very reasonable and quite honest. But is he still a conservative?  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/will-obama-ruin-the-economy-to-ruin-the-republicans-.html">He sure doesn&#8217;t always sound like one.</a></p>
<p>2) About  #1) see an example of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kleiman+ness+monster&#038;rlz=1C1FDUM_enIT485IT485&#038;oq=kleiman+ness+monster&#038;aqs=chrome.0.57j5j0l2j62l2.3635&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8">ness monster</a>:    <br />&#8220;But the conservative worldview is robust because of its imperviousness to evidence.&#8221; which clearly means ”But the conservative worldview is robust because it&#8217;s impervious to evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>3) What&#8217;s with the Bloomberg Headline person ? The article explains how Conservative&#8217;s are insane and might destroy the economy to make their prediction that it will be destroyed if Obama is re-elected true.   <br />&#8220;Conservatives are sure that the Obama presidency will lead to an economic calamity, and they will prove it, if necessary.&#8221; but the headline suggests that Obama might ruin the economy.</p>
<p>Will Obama Ruin the Economy to Ruin the Republicans?</p>

<p>A Modest Proposal for Jacob Lew: Acknowledge Three Simple Facts about U.S. Fiscal Reality</p>
<p>January 15, 2013 by <a href="http://backtofullemployment.org/author/robert-pollin/">Robert Pollin</a></p>
<p><strong></strong>In a reasonable world, in which we recognized the culpability of big-time D.C. politicians and bureaucrats who allowed Wall Street hyper-speculation to run wild and eventually cause the 2008-09 crash and Great Recession, Jacob Lew would be understood as a terrible choice as President Obama’s second-term Treasury Secretary, replacing Timothy Geithner. The outstanding journalist Robert Sheer gives us the basic background in <a href="http://www.thenation.com/article/172154/inconvenient-truth-about-jack-lew">a recent <em>Nation</em> article.</a> Sheer writes:</p>
<p><em>I suppose that he can’t be much worse than Timothy Geithner, but that should be scant cause for cheer over the news that the president has nominated Jack Lew as Treasury secretary. Both championed the financial deregulation craze of the Clinton administration, and both are acolytes of Robert Rubin, the former Clinton Treasury secretary who unfettered Wall Street greed and then took his own considerable cut of the action.</em></p>
<p>But because we are not living in a reasonable world, at least in terms of D.C.-insider debates on economic policy, Lew’s nomination apparently faces opposition from Republicans because he appears insufficiently committed to an austerity budget that could push the economy back into recession while also devastating spending for Social Security, education, health care, family support, and unemployment insurance.<br />It is clear that debate over the fiscal deficit and austerity will dominate Lew’s confirmation hearings and at least his initial period in office, if he ends up getting confirmed. But without pursuing any deep explorations about who should be taxed more or less, or whether 47 percent of U.S. citizens are indeed freeloaders, I would just propose that Lew be willing to recognize three sets of very simple, irrefutable facts about the current U.S. fiscal condition. Here they are:</p>
<p><strong>Fact #1: The U.S. government is not facing a fiscal crisis.</strong><br />In any common sense meaning of the term “fiscal crisis,” we would be referring to the government’s inability to make its forthcoming payments to its creditors. By that common sense definition, the U.S. federal government is in just about the best shape it has ever been. Figure 1 below tells the story.</p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-udqFD0n5QN0/UPgy013fBLI/AAAAAAAABYQ/9Rxqe2J-qtk/s1600/pollin.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-udqFD0n5QN0/UPgy013fBLI/AAAAAAAABYQ/9Rxqe2J-qtk/s320/pollin.png" width="320"></a></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>According to the most recent data from the third quarter of 2012 (which we term “2012.3”), the federal government spent 7.7 percent of its total expenditures on interest to its creditors. As the figure shows, that figure is less than half of the average figure under the full 12 years of Republican Presidents Reagan and Bush, when the government paid, on average, 16.8 percent of the total budget to cover interest payments. Right now, as we see, government interest payments are at near historic lows, not highs. As Treasury Secretary-designate, Lew needs to just state this obvious, and highly relevant point. To my knowledge, it has been heretofore completely left out of the insider-D.C. fiscal cliff debates, by Lew, Obama, and Geithner, to say nothing of the Republicans.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #2: Interest rates on government bonds are at historic lows.</strong><br />Figure 2 tells this story, which is well-known, but is not being given proper recognition in the deficit debates. As the figure shows, at the end of 2012, the U.S. government was borrowing at 0.7 percent on its 5-year Treasury Bonds.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rmFzLkU5JpA/UPgy0lhpUPI/AAAAAAAABYE/uDUBk5qh2So/s1600/pollin2.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="234" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-rmFzLkU5JpA/UPgy0lhpUPI/AAAAAAAABYE/uDUBk5qh2So/s320/pollin2.png" width="320"></a></div>
<p>It is precisely because the federal government can borrow so cheaply that our interest payments are corresponding low. Deficit hawks—economists and politicians alike—have been insisting for years that the rates are about to spike back up. Of course, interest rates will rise back up, at some point. We need to be vigilant about that. But this hasn’t happened over the full four year period since the onset of the Great Recession. This enables the U.S. government to maintain stimulus levels of spending, to get the economy onto a healthy growth trajectory. In other words, we have no reason to submit to an austerity agenda now. We should expect Jacob Lew to at least state the obvious here: that the deficit hawks have been wrong about an impending interest rate spike for four years running.</p>
<p><strong>Fact #3: Current large government deficits are due to the recession, not out-of-control spending.</strong><br />This is so obvious it should be barely worth mentioning. But simple facts are ignored repeatedly in the fiscal deficit debates. No doubt during the Lew hearings, there will be more discussion about the current crisis being due to the 47 percent freeloading population who, as Mitt Romney put it after his defeat, “want stuff” from the government. As we see in Figure 3, the government’s fiscal deficit spiked at 10.1 percent of GDP in 2009, immediately after the onset of the recession.</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iuW0UJCVhYg/UPgy0Gmw1MI/AAAAAAAABX4/-rkxuf-CIW0/s1600/pollin3.png" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="266" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-iuW0UJCVhYg/UPgy0Gmw1MI/AAAAAAAABX4/-rkxuf-CIW0/s320/pollin3.png" width="320"></a></div>
<p>But does anybody want to seriously claim that the pattern of fiscal deficits that we see in Figure 3 is due to the fact that people didn’t want too much stuff as of 2007 or 2008, then all of the sudden, that demand for stuff soared in 2009, which was just coincidentally exactly when the Wall Street crash brought the economy to its knees?</p>
<p>The deficit has fallen modestly since 2009, to 8.5 percent of GDP in 2012. But the single most important thing we can do to lower the fiscal deficit further is to push unemployment down. This will generate increased government revenues with people paying more in income and sales taxes, and it will reduce government payments on unemployment insurance and supplemental aid for health care and family support. The U.S. has the capacity to pursue a stimulus agenda now quite easily, precisely because interest rates and interest payments to creditors remain historically low.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be any stretch at all for Jacob Lew to acknowledge these three simple, irrefutable points. But will he do it? My guess is that he will not. If I am right in this guess, it will provide only further evidence as to the dismal state of the economic policy debate in official Washington, including Democrats like Lew here as well as Republicans.</p>
