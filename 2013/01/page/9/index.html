                                <p>I’ve long been troubled by a <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/do-we-need-the-middle-class/">Paul Krugman comment</a> from 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>There’s no obvious reason why consumer demand can’t be sustained by the spending of the upper class</strong> — $200 dinners and luxury hotels create jobs, the same way that fast food dinners and Motel 6s do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And I find in his <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2013/01/rough-transcript-stimulus-or-stymied-the-macroeconomics-of-recessions.html">concluding comment from his recent AEA session</a> that he remains completely uncertain on the issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>…we do not know how rising inequality interacts. There are more poor people who are liquidity constrained but they have less spending power, so we are not sure how it goes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m kind of astounded by this thinking, and even more by his apparent lack of curiosity about the issue. It strikes me as being absolutely central to any discussion of public policy. (<em>Viz</em>: all the talk about a strong middle class vs. trickle-down.)</p>
<p>I’ve poked at this question a couple of times:</p>
<p>In my model <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/modeling-the-wealth-income-and-saving-effects-of-redistribution-more-is-better.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wealth-and-redistribution-revisited-does-enriching-the-rich-actually-make-us-all-richer.html">here</a> looking at how (re)distribution of wealth affects demand, hence production, and</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/the-luddite-fallacy-fallacy.html">discussions</a> of imaginary ultra-high-productivity worlds in which a single person could own an atomic fabrication machine that produces everything that everyone needs (and hence receives all the income from that production).</p>
<p>Paul has clearly been <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/26/capital-biased-technological-progress-an-example-wonkish/">shifting his thinking</a> to encompass the possibility of a post-Luddite-Fallacy world. I wonder if his thinking has also developed on the related issues of inequality and distribution, and their effect on demand.</p>

                                <p>David Zetland writes more on pricing water in relation to energy concerns <a href="http://growingblue.com/2013/01/08/water-energy-and-the-economy/" title="http://growingblue.com/2013/01/08/water-energy-and-the-economy/">at Growing Blue</a>:</p>
<p>Water, energy and the economy</p>
<p>…let’s set aside the issue of environmental water and concentrate on water as a resource that can be used for economic activities. Most resource water is managed, priced and distributed by local monopolies, whether it’s an irrigation district delivering water to farmers or a utility delivering water to residential and industrial users. These monopolies often sell their water at the cost of delivery — covering the fixed costs of pipes and variable costs of treatment and pumping. It’s extremely rare that water prices reflect water scarcity, which means that it’s also rare for the price of water to rise when demand exceeds supply. This means that some users may consume “too much” water, leaving other users high and dry. (Or they may not – deciding that they’ve taken “their fair share,” but such restraint is rare when it’s possible to use more cheap water to increase profits.) Water managers may not work to prevent these shortages, since they are not penalized for shortages, allowed to raise their prices above cost, or worried about losing business to competitors.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>That’s not the case for energy, steel or trucks, as each of these businesses operate in markets, where prices adjust to equalize supply and demand and where competition makes it easier for new suppliers to meet demand when their competitors run out of inventory.</p>
<p>The impact of water shortages are much greater than implied by lost sales of water. A restaurant may pay one dollar for 100 gallons of tap water that is used to produce food worth thousands of dollars. An industrial facility may pay the same to produce products worth hundreds of times more. All of these users would be willing to pay far more in the event of water shortage, but their money is worthless when there’s no water. They then have to close the restaurant, turn off the turbines and shut down the machines for producing silicon chips or potato chips. Workers lose their wages, customers lose access to products — the effects multiply and spread, all for lack of “cheap” water that does not exist.</p>
<p>The solution to these problems is the same solution that will end our need to discuss the water-energy nexus: <em>price water for scarcity</em>. Such a solution would treat “economic water” as we treat oil, coal, shoes, coffee or any other product: prices will rise when demand exceeds supply and fall when supply exceeds demand.</p>
<p>Prices that reflect scarcity will keep supply and demand in balance, rationing water to those willing to pay more and preventing shortages. (Water managers will make more money than the cost of delivery, of course, but they can refund excess revenues to customers under the supervision of their regulators.) These operations require only a change in perspective: we need to treat water as a valuable input to our economic activities.</p>

<p>The Moral Imperative of a Debt Ceiling</p>
<p>From this morning&#8217;s <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/business/a-trillion-dollar-coin-brings-a-jackpot-of-jests.html?ref=todayspaper">New York Times</a></i>:<br />
<blockquote>Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, signed on to the trillion-dollar [platinum] coin plan, telling Capital New York: “It sounds silly but it’s absolutely legal. And it would normally not be proper to consider such a thing, except when you’re faced with blackmail to destroy the country’s economy, you have to consider things.” </p>
<p>But he might find resistance from Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon, who said he would introduce legislation to close the loophole and end the debate once and for all. </p>
<p>“My wife and I have owned and operated a small business since 1986. When it came time to pay the bills, we couldn’t just mint a coin to create more money out of thin air,” Mr. Walden said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear Bank of America:<br />   <br />As a lender to my small business, you should be the first to know of a decision I’ve decided to take.  It wasn’t easy, and I’ve given it a lot of thought, but now I’m convinced it’s the right course of action.  I won’t be making my next monthly payment.<br />  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />It is true that I have already ordered shipments of equipment and materials using the funds I’ve borrowed from you.  It is also true that I have adopted a pricing policy that’s designed to increase market share at the expense of current cash flow.  The result of these choices is that my financial obligations will exceed my revenues for an extended period of time.<br />    <br />I have a line of credit that can cover this shortfall; we discussed it at length in our meeting last month.  I appreciate your willingness to finance it at a negative real interest rate.  But I now believe that it is immoral for me to increase my debt, which could be a burden on my children and grandchildren.  As a result, I have imposed a debt limit on myself—a limit which I refuse to raise.<br />    <br />I’m sure you can understand the sound principles on which this choice is based: taking on more debt is evil.  That’s why I have chosen instead to default on your loan, as well as withhold wages I’ve promised to pay to my workers.  Please support me in this virtuous undertaking.<br />    <br />Sincerely yours&#8230;..</p>

<p>McConnell Tossing the Gauntlet on Debt, Taxes and the GOP&#8217;s dream of dismantling Social Security and Medicare</p>
<p>Pretty much as I predicted, Obama&#8217;s failure to go over the fiscal cliff&#8211;instead &#8220;negotiating&#8221; and settling for a half-assed deal that hardly got rid of any of the stupidities of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_tax_cuts">Bush tax cuts</a>&#8211;convinced the Republicans that they can play their brinkmanship game on the debt ceiling debate yet again and perhaps finally get the Democrats to undo their own most significant programs of the last 100 years&#8211;Social Security and Medicare.</p>
<p>What we ought to be doing is cutting the military/defense and corporate welfare budgets.  And then increasing taxes&#8211;with (1) new layers of tax brackets and tax rates corresponding to our new levels of income inequality, so that multimillionaires are taxed at a higher rate than mere millionaires and billionaires are taxed higher than multimillionaires and (2), at the least, legislation to eliminate the farce of the so-called &#8220;carried interest: privileged compensation taxation for LBO managers, who get mostly preferential capital gains for their &#8220;services&#8221; in buying companies and loading them with debt that makes the managers but not the workers wealthy.</p>
<p>But the Democrats somehow still thought they would get some kind of credit, even from the staunchest of the right-wingers, for being &#8220;bipartisan&#8221; and working out a &#8220;deal&#8221; to avoid the &#8220;fiscal cliff.&#8221;  So they made the ridiculous Bush tax cuts permanent, except for those in the upper-upper crust making three times as much as anybody in the middle class.  And they made the estate tax cut even larger than it was&#8211;with a $5.2 million exemption (double for a couple) and only a 40% rate.  Inequality will continue to grow at accelerated rates.  And they extended the litany of truly egregiously stupid corporate tax breaks, like the bonus depreciation/expensing provisions that ultimately permit corporate multinational giants a NEGATIVE effective tax rate (read Cary Brown on the way noneconomic frontloading of expensing amounts to nontaxation under time value of money principles).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The GOP however is currently running deranged.  The party that purports to care about fiscal conservatism only wants to fund more military and make sure that vulnerable elderly don&#8217;t get as much in their Social Security checks and have to pay even more for their health care.  McConnell&#8211;the MINORITY leader in the Senate&#8211;has pronounced his party&#8217;s views on the matter:  &#8220;The tax issue is finished.&#8221;  Brian Knowlton, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-says-no-to-more-tax-increases.html?src=recg&#038;pagewanted=print">McConnell Takes Taxes Off the Table in New Talks</a>, New York Times (Jan 6, 2013).</p>
<p>Folks, the stuff about the debt ceiling and the need to cut benefits under Social Security and Medicare is baloney.  The US government isn&#8217;t a family&#8211;it&#8217;s a sovereign regime .  We should learn from the Euro nations that are embroiled in a self-defeating austering regime that leaving citizens suffering while trying to toady to big business is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>President Obama had damn well better take Social Security and Medicare off the table as well as any corporate tax reductions.  Get rid of corporate loopholes and let corporate tax revenues INCREASE.  It is the only way left to try to re-balance an economy that is skewed in favor of the uber-rich and the multinational corporations and against ordinary Americans.  Oh, it would also help to move to single-payer single-provider health care and get profit-making out of what should be an important human right.<br />And are we &#8220;spending way too much&#8221; anyway, as McConnell declares?  Surely not, since we are only spending on things that the Congress has voted to spend on.  If McConnell wants to spend less, let him propose a spending cut and put it to the vote.  If it fails, then he should vote the taxes or borrowing needing to pay for the spending Congress has legislated.</p>
<p>So, just as my advice in the &#8220;fiscal cliff&#8221; debate was to go over the cliff, let the Bush tax cuts expire, and then put in place some decent cuts for the REAL middle class (those making less than $100,000 a year), my advice here is to go over the &#8220;sequester cliff&#8221; and let the across-the-board cuts, with the first real cuts to the military in decades, take place.  We should damp down our military zeal and start to put our money where it will build good schools, good colleges, good public transportation, and ultimately good jobs.<br />As for the debt ceiling, the best thing would be for the Senate to eliminate the filibuster rule (or at least make the right-wingers do a physical filibuster) and eliminate the debt ceiling.  It is an artifact of a different age, and is meaningless.  Think about this.</p>
<p>1) we have spending bills that require us to spend X dollars<br />2) we have tax bills that only raise X-Y dollars.<br />3) we have a governmental obligation to pay the X dollars that we spend to those who provide the goods and services amounting to X dollars.<br />4) Therefore we have a governmental obligation to borrow the Y dollars that we don&#8217;t raise with taxes.<br />cross popsted with <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/mcconnell-tossing-the-gauntlet-on-debt-taxes-and-the-gops-dream-of-dismantling-social-security-and-m.html">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p> Lew almost official as nominee for Treasury Secretary</p>
<p>Media headlines continue to tout Obama&#8217;s white male choices for rounding out his &#8216;new&#8217; cabinet.  Latest to the list is that he has offered his Jacob Lew, his current White House Chief of Staff, the post of Treasury Secretary.  See, e.g., <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-to-name-lew-treasury-secretary/2013/01/09/d6b91204-5a6b-11e2-88d0-c4cf65c3ad15_story.html">Obama to tap Jack Lew for top Treasury post,</a> Washington Post.com (Jan. 9, 2013).<br />Jack Lew has been a slew of things&#8211;hedge fund manager at Citigroup (bailed out big bank), university administrator (administrative stuff, not academic stuff) at NYU, Clinton and Obama administration OMB administrator, State Department official, and of course White House Chief of Staff.  That means he is well embedded in the Wall-Street-respecting culture of Geithner, Summers, Paulson and the rest of the DC crowd that pays too much credence to what bankers say and not enough to what ordinary Americans think.  So that is one strike against him.</p>
<p>On the other side, as the news story in the Post notes, the GOP generally views him as a tough negotiator who stands his ground on issues that Democrats have tended to consider important.  That is one big strike in his favor, especially since it is not something that his current boss is especially known for (or good at, as evidenced by the way he caved on not letting the Bush tax cuts just die of their own accord so that less stupid provisions could be put in place, especially on the corporate  and estate tax side).</p>
<p>But what about the fact that Treasury is where most tax policy thinking goes on, and thinking about the ins and outs of statutory provisions and exceptions, and thinking about &#8220;administrative&#8221; lawmaking through regulations.  Under the Bush administration, the Treasury Department put through a series of regulations that greatly facilitated concentration of corporate giants into even larger corporate giants, and did so in ways that appear to have allowed, for the first time ever, a taxpayer who engaged in a reorg transaction and received boot and stock to recognize a LOSS in the reorg transaction by allocating consideration. </p>
<p>In other words, the internal goings on at Treasury are just another place that corporate lobbyists (including continuing contact between former Treasury and IRS officials with the bar as they move back and forth) can influence the law in favor of lower taxes for business.  Shouldn&#8217;t we care how much Lew knows about tax law and what his views on that are?  I think we should.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Lew is a Harvard graduate  with a JD from Georgetown (so yes, we continue to see the elite nominating their comrades in elitedom to offices in this country).  He was a congressional aide and then policy adviser to Speaker Tip O&#8217;Neill in the late &#8217;70s, when he worked on Social Security, Medicare, budget, tax and similar issues.  So at least he&#8217;s got some depth of experience on those issues.  He practiced law for several years, but not as a tax lawyer&#8211;he worked on electricity generation. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lew">Wikipedia </a>says he has also dealt with Middle East issues and various other things in other short-term posts he has held.  So a peripatetic acquirer of bits of experience and knowledge across a range of things, but not an economist and not a tax lawyer.</p>
<p>Does that make him qualified to head Treasury and to advise on what has become one of the most important areas of the law, in which we subsidize whole industries, give huge tax breaks to huge multinational corporations without even understanding how much of a break we are giving them (the bonus depreciation/accelerated depreciation/expensing regime and the active financing exception), and continue to consider that some of the richest people in the country are just &#8220;middle class&#8221;?  I have my doubts.</p>
<p>Remember that in both of the big &#8220;economic&#8221; commissions of the last couple of years (Alice Rivlin&#8217;s, Erskine Bowles&#8217;) there were no actual tax lawyers&#8211;not even tax academics&#8211;involved.  Maybe that&#8217;s one reason the ideas miss out so much on what is reasonable.  Maybe it&#8217;s time that a range of tax academics were listened to about what shape the tax code needs to take, and why.</p>

                                <div>From an interview at <a href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=31&#038;Itemid=74&#038;jumival=9405">Real News</a>   with Patrick Bond (the Director of the Center for Civil Society and Professor at the University of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa):</div>
<p>
<blockquote>And the idea is that if you value the environment, you should put a price tag on it so that its destruction is not just a [free] activity—so say the proponents. But critics say this is equivalent to neoliberalizing nature or privatizing the air in the case of climate and carbon trading.</p>
<p>And what became even trickier was in Doha the idea called loss and damage, which is another way of saying that the North owes the South a climate debt for the huge destructive force. I mean, Barack Obama just asked for some $60 billion from Congress to clean up after Sandy. And so this is the sort of huge scale of loss and damage, and even more so in the Third World, the main victims of climate change here in Africa, maybe 200 million deaths anticipated this century.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>And the big question we&#8217;ll all be asking in the coming months: can you put a price on it? And if you do so, in order for the North to pay up, does that mean that you endorse markets for the environment? And that&#8217;s a tricky situation for many environmentalists not wanting to go too far towards neoliberal nature, but on the other hand, demanding a climate and an ecological debt be paid.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>And one of the finest theorists, Larry Lohmann at Corner House group, explained it to me in Rio very simply, and I think we all should learn from Larry Lohmann. He said the difference between a fine on a big corporation, for example, Texaco—Texaco, now Chevron, polluted about $8 billion worth in the Ecuadoran Amazon, and a court found them guilty. Of course, they&#8217;re refusing to pay. They&#8217;re a big U.S. corporation. And the idea is they should be fined and then banned from doing that again. And that is an acceptable strategy for progressive environmentalists.</p>
<p>The problem is if you allow that activity to be mandated through a fee, a fee for an ecosystem service. And it&#8217;s in that very nuanced <i>distinction between putting a price on something because you value it and making someone who destroys it pay for the damage on the one hand,</i> which I think is reasonable—on the other hand, the danger would be if you try to create markets. And this is what&#8217;s really running rampant.</p>
<p>Here in southern Africa, natural capital will soon be actually calculated as a way to correct gross domestic product, something that&#8217;s way overdue, because GDP, what economists like to do to measure growth, ignores environmental destruction, not to mention women&#8217;s unpaid labor or community activism or crime or family breakdown. All of these important things are not measured. And the attempt to correct it, natural capital, if it&#8217;s used properly, would give us a whole new dimension on whether we should be extracting at the rate, for example, here in our platinum mines we do which led to the Marikana Massacre in August.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the sort of question that I think environmentalists and community activists and labor movements, women&#8217;s groups, will be asking more and more. Is it really worth it? And should we not be calculating into a cost-benefit analysis the destructive capacity of capital when it meets nature, and then trying to prevent that process from becoming something like a carbon market or offsets for biodiversity? And a green economy strategy of the World Bank of many big agencies leans towards markets. And this is going to be the struggle of 2013, I predict.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why Much of the Population Thinks Economists are Charlatans</p>
<p>Noah Smith asks <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2013/01/why-do-people-think-economists-are.html">why people think economists are charlatans</a>.  He concludes it has something to do with trade.</p>
<p>I submit the answer is much, much simpler, and I think it deals with the part of economics which has most visibility with the public: macroeconomics.  Read <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">this</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">post from a few years ago</a> about an economist who is reasonably prominent outside academia.  But it wouldn&#8217;t be difficult to make a list of other economists, whether with a bit of prominence outside academia or inside it or both, for whom one could write essentially<br />the same post.  Heck, if we wrote down a list of chairs of the President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisors, budget directors, and Treasury Secretaries, how many of them couldn&#8217;t be the subject of that sort of post?  And let&#8217;s be realistic, there is no cost to doing so. Consider the folks  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/11/surplus-deficit-and-recession-wondering.html">who</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/11/surplus-deficit-and-recession-wondering.html">retroactively predicted double digit growth rates in 2002</a>.  None of them suffered consequences, regardless of the damage they caused.<br />None.</p>
<p>What happens if you do the same thing in another field?  What happens if to a guy who peddles Lysenkoism in Biology?  Think they&#8217;ll make him Dean of a prominent Medical School?  A physicist who makes her life<br />work debunking the Michelson Morley experiment ain&#8217;t gonna go far either.  Obvious charlatans in biology or physics or chemistry get treated like charlatans by people who call themselves biologists, physicists and chemists, even those who work in different parts of the field.  People who call themselves economists (whether macroeconomists or otherwise) sit on panels and attend conferences with the obvious charlatans.  They shake hands with the obvious charlatans, they don&#8217;t spit on the floor and turn their back on the obvious charlatans, and most damning of all, they don&#8217;t refer to them as obvious charlatans. And meanwhile, the obvious charlatans do very well.  Fudging and shading the data can pay very well, especially if one is well spoken and looks presentable.</p>
<p>The problem is, a career where it is easy and lucrative to be a charlatan, where being an obvious charlatan has no consequences or costs but plenty of benefits will attract more and more obvious charlatans.  In fact, there are a couple old principles in economics, from back in the day when the field wasn&#8217;t as infested that can tell  you what happens next.  We&#8217;re long past the point where the public has figured it out.  The only thing that will save the profession is if economists figured it out too.</p>

<div dir="ltr">From a website called Daily Writ today, in a post called “<a href="http://dailywrit.com/2013/01/likelihood-of-a-petition-being-granted/">Likelihood of a Petition Being Granted</a>”:</div>
<div dir="ltr">There are a lot of numbers thrown out about the likelihood of a cert. petition being granted. The number I’ve always heard is 1%, but I sometimes hear numbers as high as 5%.</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">According to <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/journal/jnl11.pdf">statistics</a> from the Supreme Court, between June 30, 2011 and July 2, 2012, the Court disposed of 7,654 appeals and granted 63 for oral argument (.862%). That doesn’t count GVRs, but with those, it is safe to say the rate of grant is about 1% for all cert. petitions.</div>
<div dir="ltr"></div>
<div dir="ltr">If you want to break up petitions into paid and IFP petitions — the most obvious division among all appeals filed at the Court — the following table provides a breakdown of the cases disposed of and granted during a twelve-month period between June 2011 and July 2012:</div>

<div dir="ltr">Of course, last year was a slight aberration because the Court decided fewer cases after oral argument than it had in at least the past twenty years. But data from the previous year confirms that the past year was only a slight deviation from the norm. During the previous twelve-month period, the Court granted 76 of 1580 paid petitions (4.8%), 14 of 6245 IFP petitions (.224%), and 90 of 7825 all petitions filed (1.15%).

<div dir="ltr">If you need to tell someone how likely it is that a petition will be granted, here is a cheat sheet:</div>
<p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">Overall: 1%</div>
</li>

<div dir="ltr">Paid petition: 4%</div>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<div dir="ltr">IFP petition: .1%</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But even those bald statistics don’t accurately indicate what’s happening.  “IMP” stands for “in forma pauperis.”  In order to be permitted to file a Supreme Court “cert. petition” (a petition asking the Court to hear your case in  order to consider reversing the lower appellate court’s ruling against you, on some issue of federal law) without paying the filing fee&#8211;or, for that matter, in order to be permitted to file any lawsuit or appeal at any level of the state or federal court system, without paying the filing fee to do so&#8211;you have to demonstrate that you do not have the filing fee.  
<div>The filing fee for a cert. petition is $300, which actually is $155 less than the fee to file an appeal in a lower federal appellate court (called a “circuit” court).  And since almost all federal lawsuits filed by ordinary individuals are systematically dismissed by the trial-court-level judge (knows as the “district judge”) shortly after they’re filed, and you have only 21 days in which to file a notice of appeal and pay the filing fee, you have to pay lay out about $800 within a very short period of time in order to have some chance to actually litigate your lawsuit.  </p>
<p>The cost of filing a cert. petition&#8211;the term “cert. is shorthand for “certiorari,” and is used only to refer to U.S. Supreme Court petitions&#8211;actually is roughly $5,000 to $7,000.  That’s because the Supreme Court’s Rules require the submission of an “original” and 39 (39!) copies of the cert. petition, which, the Rules require, must be submitted in “booklet” form.  “Booklet” form being a term of art: a prescribed size paper, which, suffice it to say, you can’t buy at Staples, card-stock covers of that same prescribed size (not available at Staples either), and a specific type of (expensive, actual-book-style) binding.  Only (I believe) three printing companies in the country specialize in this.  The petition itself is limited to 30 pages, but the Appendix&#8211;relevant court documents and exhibits in the case&#8211;must be included in the “booklet” or printed in its own separate “booklet.”  Only IFP petitioners can avoid this; they can file just an original and nine copies, on standard-size photocopy paper.  </p>
<p>So unless you literally don’t have  $300 (many prisoners don’t, of course), and you don’t have $5,000 to $7,000 at your disposal to spend on a lottery ticket, you can’t file a cert. petition at all, unless you’re able to get some nonprofit organization; there are a number of rightwing ones that will litigate for you and pay the expenses, but only the ACLU, to my knowledge, on the left.  Good luck, unless you have a real estate “takings” case, a gun-ownership-rights case, a freedom-of-religion/government-discrimination-against-religion case, or a reverse-race-discrimination case. </p>
<p>But I digress.  The subject of this post is the number of <i>filed</i> cert. petitions the Court grants.  And whose filed cert. petitions the Court grants.  And the statistics reflected in the Court’s new report give only part of that story, because a large percentage of the petitions the Court grants each year are those filed by governments&#8211;sometimes the federal government, but more often state governments (usually formally in the name of a state government employee or official such as a prison warden, thanks to a peculiarity in constitutional law), or local governments or an official or employee of one, e.g., a police officer.  These petitions are counted as “paid” petitions in the Court’s statistics.</p>
<p>And a large percentage of the remainder of the “paid” petitions that the Court grants are indeed very highly paid petitions.  They bear, on the petition cover, the name of a member of a tiny cadre of Supreme Court lobbyists&#8211;er, extremely highly-paid Supreme Court “specialists”&#8211;whose actual specialty is getting the Chamber of Commerce contingent on the Court to read the petition.  And, with the exception of very wealthy individuals such as Conrad Black and Jeffrey Skilling,* persons of the non-corporate variety need not, or more accurately, <i>cannot</i> apply.</p>
<p>So, here’s how I illustrate to people of the human type the reality of the clownish formal and <i>de facto</i> rules and customs of this clownish institution: I advise them to take their $6,000 and buy actual lottery tickets with it.  Or travel to Las Vegas and have some fun.  Or just throw it into the closest large body of water.  The Great Lakes here in the upper Midwest would work just fine.</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*The Supreme Court granted both Black’s and Skilling’s cert. petitions, filed on their respective behalfs by members of that cadre, commonly known as “the elite Supreme Court bar.”  Elite here being a legal term of art meaning “wayyy out the price range of ordinary folk.”  Their petitions challenged as unconstitutionally vague a federal criminal statute upon which parts of their indictments were based.  They won.  In unanimous opinions, if I recall correctly, the Court ruled the statute unconstitutionally vague.  And with good reason: it was.  But countless others before them surely had challenged that statute as unconstitutionally vague, to no avail.  This follows an absolutely institutionalized pattern in that Court.</div>

<blockquote><p>Smith is a conjecture about the virtues of a free-market economy”, is so absurd as to be embarrassing.  That Adam Smith favoured “a free market economy” is approximately correct.  That he asserted that a free market economy had virtues.  Is also correct.</p>
<p>But that he linked his use of the metaphor to his singular use in Wealth Of Nations (1776 and through six editions to 1790) of the metaphor “an invisible hand” to free-markets is at variance with the textual facts.  Even adding the other use of the IH metaphor in Moral Sentiments (1759 and through six editions to 1790) is of no help at all to Eduardo Pol’s proposition that the IH was “a conjecture about the virtues of a free-market economy”.Adam Smith did not mention ‘the virtues of a free market economy” in either case where he used the IH metaphor.  How could he?*&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Lots more and very specific.</p>
