<p> Right-Wing Mythology 101: the myth of the rich fleeing taxes</p>
<p> One of the right-wing&#8217;s most cherished myths is that highly progressive taxes will kill state revenues, since the rich who have the money to pay them will simply move to a more accommodating jurisdiction.<br />This is repeated in most conversations I&#8217;ve had with staunch right-wingers.  They cite their firm &#8220;knowledge&#8221; of this so-called &#8220;fact&#8221;.   &#8220;I work as a CPA and I&#8217;ve seen several rich people who left because of taxes&#8221;, they&#8217;ll say. Or &#8220;My friend is a private banker and he says lots of his rich clients are moving from California because of its high taxes.&#8221;  And similar anecdotes.</p>
<p>Of course, there are always a few high-profile cases that seem to confirm the myth.  Celebrities like actor Gerard Depardieu who gave up his French citizenship for a Russian passport make the news.  Celebrities like golfer Phil Mickelson who huffed off a golf course saying he might move because California increased its top rate from 10.3 percent to 13.3 percent get lots of coverage.  These celebrities, of course, make many millions and 1) could afford to pay an additional 2% in state taxes but also 2) tend to develop huge egos that see themselves as the center of the universe and can easily move (since their work is not generally in a single locale).  The people&#8217;s response should be to shame them for being so greedy that they aren&#8217;t willing to contribute what for them is a piddling amount to make their state better for all its citizens&#8211;Phil M experienced a bit of that.  The government&#8217;s response should be to discount them as a major force, since they offer merely a rare example of someone with enough money, flexibility, lack of loyalty and ties to carry out a threat to move.</p>
<p>My personal response tends to be&#8211;well,go ahead and move, Mr (Ms) Disloyal.  You might as well move to Texas, where you can find a vast cultural lacuna along with a idiot Governor who denies global climate change, but you can always go barbecuing with George W. Bush on his ranch.  Best of luck with the lack of decent water and decent air (and decent anything else) in the future&#8211;I hear Halliburton has made quite a mess of parts of Texas&#8230;..</p>
<p>The media, of course, has covered these cases elaborately&#8211;but luckily at least some of the national media has paid attention to what the empirical evidence, rather than anecdotes, says about moves of the rich.  See, e.g.,  James B. Stewart, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/business/high-taxes-are-not-a-prime-reason-for-relocation-studies-say.html">The Myth of the rich Who Flee From Taxes</a>, New York Times (Feb. 15, 2013).<br />It turns out that various economists have studied the question of tax flight.  Jon Shure (Center on Budget and Policy Priorities), Robert Tannenwald (former Federal Reserve economist) and Nicolas Johnson wrote a paper in 2011 called &#8220;<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&#038;id=3556">Tax Flight is a Myth</a>&#8221; (executive summary and pdf available at the link).  Here are some excerpts from the summary.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The effects of tax increases on migration are, at most, small — so small that states that raise income taxes on the most affluent households can be assured of a substantial net gain in revenue.</p>
<p>***<br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>Migration is not common.</strong> Most people have strong ties to their current state, such as job, home, family, friends, and community. On average, just 1.7 percent of U.S. residents moved from one state to another per year between 2001 and 2010, and only about 30 percent of those born in the United States change their state of residence over the course of their entire lifetime. &#8230;<br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>The migration that’s occurring is much more likely to be driven by cheaper housing than by lower taxes. </strong>A family might be able to cut its taxes by a few percentage points by moving from one state to another, but housing costs are far more variable. The difference between housing costs in two different states is often many times greater than the difference in taxes.<br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>Recent research shows income tax increases cause little or no interstate migration. </strong>Perhaps the most carefully designed study to date on this issue concerned the potential migration impact of New Jersey’s 2004 tax increase on filers with incomes exceeding $500,000. &#8230; At most, the authors estimated, 70 tax filers earning more than $500,000 might have left New Jersey between 2004 and 2007 because of the tax increase, costing the state an estimated $16.4 million in tax revenue. The revenue gain from the tax increase over those years was an estimated $3.77 billion&#8230;.</p>
<p>The study goes on to look at several of the states that have been reported, anecdotally, to have considerable in-or out-migration due to low-or high-taxation&#8211;such as California, Florida, Maryland.  It shows that much of the rationale for movement out of California (and now, out of Florida) had to do with the exceptionally high cost of housing.  While taxes may sometimes be a factor in moves, the primary factors are housing costs, employment, weather, colleges, family, natural disasters and many other economic, democraghic and personal considerations.  In fact, the study reminds that &#8220;many of the factors deterring people from moving are most prevalanet among households with higher-than-average incomes&#8221;.</p>
<p>The claims underlying the tax migration myth are, in fact, &#8220;fundamentally flawed&#8221;: they confuse correlation with causation, misrepresent irrelevant findings, and improperly measure migration.</p>
<p>The study provides some useful appendices,  One illustrates how studies by a consulting firm drew arbitrary conclusions about migration patterns with the Portland metropolitan area. \</p>
<p>Interested readers can find another study showing that higher tax rates don&#8217;t cause significant numbers of wealthy taxpayers to flee, reviewing the new tax bracket created for millionaires in Maryland, at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy: <a href="http://www.itepnet.org/pdf/md_5millionaires_0311.pdf">Five Reasons to Reinstate Maryland&#8217;s Millionaires&#8217; Tax</a>, ITEP (March 9, 2011). </p>

<div>Health Care Thoughts:  Obamacare  Updates</div>
<div></div>
<div>The slow march toward full implementation continues.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Exchanges –  As of today 17 states will create their own exchange, seven states will partner with the government, and 26 states have defaulted to the federal program (if anyone asked me I would suggest defaulting in order to let the feds do the early heavy lifting).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Perhaps the most important questions now are:</div>
<div></div>
<div>Will any of the exchanges be ready on time?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Will the products be affordable?</div>
<div></div>
<div>How will employers respond?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Employer Response – there is a great deal of discussion but very few decisions have been announced (although some are likely in place but not announced). </div>
<div></div>
<div>Will a generally weak economy and slack labor market play into the decisions? Time will tell.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A strategy of self-insuring may gain favor, and I will do a separate post on that topic.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Providers – the word I hear most often is “chaos.”  Providers are trying to prepare for a system as yet poorly defined. Some trends are emerging (integration, the early ACOs) but it is too early to tell how anything will work.</div>
<div></div>

                                <p>President Obama&#8217;s proposal to raise the minimum wage to $9.00 per hour puts the Republicans between a rock and a hard place <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2013/02/15/the_minimum_wage_and_the_doom_of_the_gop.html">politically</a>. <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/two-observations-on-the-politics-of-the-minimum-wage/">Paul Krugman</a> echoes the point that a big majority of the population supports a  minimum wage increase, including a majority of Republicans (his linking  to the original poll source appears to have crashed that website, but I  will update later). Yet the Republican leadership remains trapped  because it opposes this increase as well as any alternative policy that  might make the poor better off, such as increasing the Earned Income Tax  Credit or endorsing a Guaranteed Minimum Income (points Matthew  Yglesias makes in the link above). As further evidence, the minimum wage  increase Proposition B in Missouri in 2006 passed 76-24, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/07/its-middle-class-stupid-review.html">probably helping Senator Claire McCaskill</a> to her first Senate victory with under 50% of the vote.</p>
<p> Moreover, <a href="http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/min-wage-2013-02.pdf">much recent research</a> (via <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2013/02/14/1594181/no-firing-minimum-wage-raise/">Think Progress</a>)  shows no &#8220;job killing&#8221; effects from raising the minimum wage. As  originally shown by David Card and Alan Krueger, there was strong  evidence of &#8220;publication bias&#8221; in the studies underlying the former  economists&#8217; consensus that the minimum wage reduced jobs. That is,  economics journals tended to prefer to publish studies with  statistically significant results and not publish those showing no  effect from the minimum wage. Researchers thus adjusted their  statistical specifications until they achieved statistical significance,  thereby generating a mass of studies that all barely reached  statistical significance despite larger volumes of data which should  have produced stronger results. As the Schmitt paper emphasizes, more  recent studies of studies (&#8220;meta-analysis&#8221;) continues to support the  conclusion that the purported job killing effect was a mirage.</p>
<p><a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/labor-day-of-nine-oecd-members-with.html">As I have pointed out before</a>,  cross-national comparisons of the minimum wage and unemployment rates  also do not support the view that the minimum wage is the job killer  Republicans claim it is. Indeed,  as in my September 2011 post, nine  OECD countries have higher minimum wages rates than the U.S. does on a  purchasing power parity basis that adjusts for the cost of living, yet  only two have higher unemployment rates (France and Ireland), while the  U.K.&#8217;s unemployment rate is the same. The table below illustrates this  and underscores the point that the minimum wage is a winner for the  middle class.</p>

Below we have <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OTfGBMswYDs/UQyPQJI8UXI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/zFrPQUexXaY/s1600/8453866348957.jpg">3 images of methane concentrations above the Arctic Ocean from 3 ten day periods in january</a> (January 1-10, January 11-20, and January 21-31) from Russian physicist Dr. Leonid Yurganov.. The methane concentration scale, with darker reds being the highest, can be viewed by <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OTfGBMswYDs/UQyPQJI8UXI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/zFrPQUexXaY/s1600/8453866348957.jpg">clicking on the image to enlarge it</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OTfGBMswYDs/UQyPQJI8UXI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/zFrPQUexXaY/s1600/8453866348957.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OTfGBMswYDs/UQyPQJI8UXI/AAAAAAAAJKQ/zFrPQUexXaY/s640/8453866348957.jpg" height="145" width="400"></a></p>
<p>Quite obviously, there&#8217;s been a sudden increase in atmospheric methane in an area of the arctic ocean north of eastern Europe and western Asia. <a href="http://arctic-news.blogspot.com/2013/02/dramatic-increase-in-methane-in-the-arctic-in-january-2013.html">As shown in the post about this at Arctic News</a>, that <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cytwgPSpkDE/UQyQDPryYBI/AAAAAAAAJKc/IXsj2KBw-l0/s1600/4537458256.jpg">area where the methane concentrations are highest coincides with the area of the arctic ocean that is still relatively ice-free</a>. <br />This dramatic increase in atmospheric methane seems to be similar to <a href="http://marketwatch666.blogspot.com/2012/01/notes-on-dec-unemployment-lpss-mortgage.html">an arctic event that we covered a little over a year ago</a> that occurred in November 2011. At that time <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/vast-methane-plumes-seen-in-arctic-ocean-as-sea-ice-retreats-6276278.html">Russian scientists had observed vast plumes of methane bubbling to the surface of the arctic ocean</a> off the coast of eastern Siberia, which they described as &#8220;powerful and impressive seeping structures more than 1,000 metres in diameter&#8221;.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Back then we figured that since that eastern Siberian area was one of the shallowest areas of the arctic, it had warmed enough during a period of unusual atmospheric circulation that fall to thaw the extensive amounts of frozen methane hydrates known to be locked up by high pressure and cold temperatures on the ocean floor, and they were melting and rising to the surface. In this case it appears that a branch of the warm gulf stream current is causing enough warming to destabilize the frozen methane on the ocean floor in the areas between Norway and Svalbard and points east. This is similar to a <a href="http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2012/10/gulf-stream-unlocking-frozen-methane">scenario that was warned about in a study in the journal Nature in October</a>.</p>
<p>What happens next is anyone&#8217;s guess, but Dr Yurganov&#8217;s records indicate that <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KFB9QRidvSM/UQ8bQZJv8OI/AAAAAAAAJNo/tRmzygYW278/s1600/Methane-Jan21-31.jpg">higher levels of arctic methane emissions have been increasing over time</a>. (US scientists must now rely on Canadian &#038; European monitoring of greenhouse gas emissions because <a href="http://climatechangepsychology.blogspot.com/2013/02/noaa-monitoring-of-arctic-methane-and.html">NOAA’s monitoring of Arctic methane and CO2 was halted last week by budget cuts</a>). <a href="http://marketwatch666.blogspot.com/2012/11/unemployment-by-state-housing-starts.html">We&#8217;ve pointed out before </a>that atmospheric<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;frm=1&#038;source=web&#038;cd=2&#038;cad=rja&#038;ved=0CDkQFjAB&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2012%2F11%2F20%2Fworld%2Feurope%2Fgreenhouse-gases-record-high%2Findex.html&#038;ei=FN2wULzkG6WOyAGN_oCYBg&#038;usg=AFQjCNHzsggL2vVDdBWfchF6zfQ-lS-EHw"> methane hit a new high of about 1813 parts per billion (ppb) in 2011, which was at 259% of the pre-industrial level</a>, and that<a href="http://www.wmo.int/pages/mediacentre/press_releases/pr_965_en.html"> 40% of the increase was coming from natural sources such as this</a>. Methane is 25 times as potent a heat-trapping gas as CO2 over a 100 year time horizon, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming_potential">but 72 times as potent over 20 years</a>, and <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2013/01/links-11213.html#comment-1020851">methane&#8217;s global heat trapping effect is now roughly one-third that of CO2</a>. Further <a href="http://arcticmethane.blogspot.com/2012/05/potential-impact-of-large-abrupt.html">thoughts on the potential impact of large abrupt release of methane in the Arctic are here</a>. Suffice it to say that <a href="http://climatechangepsychology.blogspot.com/2013/02/thawing-permafrost-may-be-huge-factor.html">if all the ancient carbon were to be released from the arctic it would be enough to raise global temperatures 3C</a> on top of <a href="http://marketwatch666.blogspot.com/2012/11/unemployment-by-state-housing-starts.html">the 4C temperature rise from human activities predicted by the recent World Bank study</a>…</p>

With the associated warming in the arctic, we can only expect the frequency and range of such arctic methane releases to increase, from both the seabed and the permafrost.</p>

<p>A <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2013/02/why_have_kids_m.html#comments">comment on a post at EconLog</a>, a very libertarian website&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>I can say that in my lifetime, I have not earned enough money for me to have kids. I&#8217;m 36. I know some have had kids on my income or less but it certainly is not enough money for me. I can&#8217;t imagine how it would have been if I had kids.</p></blockquote>
<p>And this <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/the-kids-are-alright/?comments#permid=128">comment on a post by Paul Krugman, on the liberal side of the spectrum</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I personally have never had the stability in my life where I thought it was okay for me to go off and spawn a family the way my parents did beginning in 1953. My father worked hard, and loved to work, had good employment and good pay, without a college degree. </p>
<p>Where as, he sent me to private schools, I got honor roll grades, bachelors degree, doctorate degree, I re-engineered manufacturing systems at some of America&#8217;s largest companies, but still I never felt secure in my employment, nor was I. </p>
<p>I am unemployed now, as I was in 2010, as I was in 2006, as I was in 1991, as I was for a time in 1984, 1983 and 1982 &#8211; when I graduated.</p>
<p>The current generation is facing a geometrically greater challenge than I did. So I can see why traditional family life is in decline. </p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting how the problem is the framed the same way at different ends of the political spectrum.  I note that this framing also fits my life &#8211; my wife and I got married late and had one child (one and done) very late.  Economic worries were a big part of the decision making process.  On paper, my wife and I are doing relatively well financially, but we are extremely aware that a job loss &#8211; something that has become extremely common in recent years &#8211; or one financial mis-step could mean the difference between whether our son will have far greater opportunity in life than either my wife or I did growing up, or far less opportunity.  There doesn&#8217;t seem to be much in-between.   In talking with my parents, they also seem to believe outcomes are more stark for families today.  Many of my friends tell me the same thing.  And when I talk to people ten or twenty years younger than I, in general, their costs seem to be higher than those I faced, and the potential opportunities fewer.</p>
<p>The result is that most people I know within ten years of my age have between zero and two kids.   While there are exceptions, in general, people I can name with three or more kids either are in the top 2% or so, income-wise (and most of them are in finance or have inherited wealth or both), or are well below the median.  (Note &#8211;  I went looking for data on number of children by income level in the US but couldn&#8217;t find any.)  I wonder if that&#8217;s a portent of things to come, and what it implies for the stability of society going forward.</p>

The link presents Mr. Wagner&#8217;s reply to the storm of comment to the original, which follows.  Here is an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>One instance of constitutional compromise was the agreement to count three-fifths of the slave population for purposes of state representation in Congress. Southern delegates wanted to count the whole slave population, which would have given the South greater influence over national policy. Northern delegates argued that slaves should not be counted at all, because they had no vote. As the price for achieving the ultimate aim of the Constitution—“to form a more perfect union”—the two sides compromised on this immediate issue of how to count slaves in the new nation. Pragmatic half-victories kept in view the higher aspiration of drawing the country more closely together.</p>
<p>Some might suggest that the constitutional compromise reached for the lowest common denominator—for the barest minimum value on which both sides could agree. I rather think something different happened. Both sides found a way to temper ideology and continue working toward the highest aspiration they both shared—the aspiration to form a more perfect union. They set their sights higher, not lower, in order to identify their common goal and keep moving toward it.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The bank <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/article/20120827/BUSINESS/120827016/?nclick_check=1">fired Richard Eggers from his job</a> of seven years as a customer service representative after the company found out about a decades-old run-in with the law, the <em>Des Moines Register</em> reports. In 1963 Eggers got caught putting a cardboard cut-out of a dime in a washing machine at a laundromat.</p>
<p>Eggers’ firing is one of thousands now occurring due to stricter guidelines on bank and mortgage lender employees that went into effect last year. The new rules are meant to gut the institutions of workers convicted of various types of fraud, but the <a href="http://www.woi-tv.com/story/19390887/man-fired-50-years-after-laudromat-fraud">casualties have largely been low-level workers</a> like Eggers, according to ABC5 News.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have discretion to grant exceptions in situations like this,&#8221; Angela Kaipust, a spokeswoman for Wells Fargo <a href="http://www.woi-tv.com/story/19390887/man-fired-50-years-after-laudromat-fraud">told the television station</a>. &#8220;Once we find out someone has a criminal history of dishonesty or breach of trust we can no longer employ them.&#8221;<br />In a similar case, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/07/yolanda-quesada-wells-fargo_n_1496273.html#s609107&#038;title=10_Real_Estate">Wells Fargo fired Yolanda Quesada</a> in May after a background check turned over a shoplifting charge from 1972.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/anatole-kaletsky/2013/02/07/a-breakthrough-speech-on-monetary-policy/" target="_blank">From Reuters</a> comes this comment on the speech.  I haven&#8217;t seen much coverage.<br />
<blockquote>Wednesday night may have marked the “emperor’s new clothes” moment of the Great Recession, in which the world suddenly realizes its rulers are suffering from a delusion that doesn’t have to be humored. That delusion today is economic fatalism: the idea that nothing can be done to break the paralysis in the global economy and therefore that a “new normal” of mass unemployment and declining living standards is inevitable for years or decades to come.</p>
<p>That such economic fatalism is nonsensical is the key message of a truly historic speech delivered on Wednesday by Adair Turner, chairman of Britain’s Financial Services Authority and one of the most influential financial policymakers in the world. Turner argues that a virtually surefire method of stimulating economic activity exists today and that politicians and central bankers can no longer treat it as taboo: Newly created money should be handed out to the citizens or governments of countries that are mired in stagnation and such monetary financing of tax cuts or government spending should continue until economic activity revives.</p></blockquote>

<p>Mark Thoma puts Holtz-Eakin on (figurative) hot seat</p>
<p> As most of the Angry Bear and ataxingmatter readers know, I do not frequently applaud the economic punditry of those freshwater economists who think the way to deal with the problem of failed market fundamentalism policies is to double-down on those failed policies. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noted that we tried that already.  We doubled down on  reaganomics policies of tax cuts/militarization/deregulation/&#038; privatization throughout the Bush regime, and that got us into a witch&#8217;s brew of problems. </p>
<p><strong>Because of that double-down mentality, where the neos told us war was good and greed was good and where we applied the laughable, made-up-out-of-whole-cloth &#8220;Laffer theory&#8221; that told us there was no evil that tax cuts (especially for the rich and big corporations) couldn&#8217;t conquer, the Bush regime very ably turned a budget surplus into a staggering deficit and a financil crisis that would guarantee more deficits and debt before we were done with it. </strong><br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>We ended up with failed (de)regulatory policies.  They</strong> allowed Big Banks and their big moneymakers to speculate their way into phantom billions of profits (all soaked up by the big jefes/big moneymakers).  But instead, we got a near-breakdown of the financial system, that forced all us ordinary taxpayers to subsidize the Big Banks&#8217; losses without getting recompense from the banksters&#8217; earlier oversized payouts. <br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>We ended up with failed tax (cut) policies.  They</strong> cut taxes on big multinational corporations and the ultra rich, based on the claim that those are the &#8220;job creators&#8221; that we should reward.  But instead  they only ended up siphoning off needed revenues from programs that could build infrastructure and support quality education and research.  They privatized education by providing lots of federal loan money to students that went to for-profit schools, only to learn that those schools tend to be traps that don&#8217;t educate but just take money for the profit of the &#8220;education&#8221; business.  They quit funding the stuff we need, so they could subsidize those that didn&#8217;t need it.  And they kept the subsidy up&#8211;for Big Oil, for wealthy decedents&#8211;even when the money was just piling on for those that already had lots of it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what makes the current ultra-partisan Congress and the constant right-wing talk of deficits and debt as justification for stripping the safety net (while still conferring outsize gains on the ultra rich and Big Business) so disgusting.  <strong>The right still  refuses to pay attention to facts and justifies this oft-discredited, clearly wrong-headed market-fundamentalist and class-warfare orthodoxy as &#8220;plain as day&#8221; correct thinking. </strong><br /><em><br /></em> <em>ASIDE:  This seems sort of like the GOP&#8217;s plans for gaining the loyalty of our increasing diverse electorate by being careful to package their mostly white, Friedman-orthodox, oligarchy-favoring policies in the sheep&#8217;s clothing of multicultural spokespersons who avoid the &#8220;tell&#8221; of who they really are and use words that talk about ordinary people as though the policies were actually aimed at benefitting them.  Meanwhile they double-down on their claims that redistribution upward is all about job creation, and condemn those who talk about preserving the safety net by NOT reducing benefits as &#8220;socialists&#8221; who don&#8217;t understand the American way. </em><br /><em><br /></em> <em>The American way they seem to be harking to is the era of the corporate titans of malfeasance that Teddy Roosevelt warned us against, who grabbed the gains of the market place well in excess of their productivity merit and didn&#8217;t give a damn about the rest of us. (Take Leland Stanford and the building of the great western railroads, subsidized by vast land grants and other programs from the federal government.  Stanford was quite willing to let the Chinamen he hired to use their explosive expertise to carve out railroad tunnels live in hunger because he withheld their pay and die because of inadequate safety , but meanwhile he lived a life of luxury supported by his corporate structure that sent all the money supported by the government subsidies his way and none of it theirs.)</em><br /><strong><br /></strong> <strong>Douglas Holtz-Eakin is a prime example of doubling down on failed policies by ignoring the facts of recent experience.</strong>  See Holtz-Eakin, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2013/feb/14/get-us-government-spending-under-control">We have to get US government spending under control</a>, guardian.co.uk (Feb. 14, 2013).  Mark Thoma does a good job of putting him on the hot seat and telling it like it really is.  Read it at <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2013/02/holtz-eakin-tries-to-scare-you-dont-let-him.html">Holtz-Eakin Tries to Scare You. Don&#8217;t Let Him</a>, Economist&#8217;s View (Feb. 14, 2013).  Here&#8217;s an excerpt:</p>
<blockquote><p>Holtz-Eakin (in the Guardian essay): &#8220;Debt reduction produces jobs and better economic growth.&#8221;<br />Mark Thoma (in the Economist&#8217;s View take-down): &#8220;[R]eading that last line, he has learned nothing from the failure of the confidence fairy to appear.  Waiting to fix the debt&#8211;a problem driven mainly by health care cost escalation that won&#8217;t become severe for many years&#8211;is not risky, but his advice certainly is.&#8221;<br />***<br />Holtz-Eakin (in the Guardian essay): &#8220;Down with the orthodoxy.  It is time to get the deficit under control.&#8221;<br />Mark Thoma (in the Economist&#8217;s View take-down): &#8220;The notion that we are responding in the same way as in the 60s and 70s, and that we are faced [with] the same type of shock (that require[s] the same types of policies)&#8211;an oil price shock and other large supply-side distrubances from demography that we faced then&#8211;is wrong and he ought to know that.&#8221;&#8230;..&#8221;The &#8216;pundit orthodoxy&#8217; he disses is from Paul Krugman.  Kind of funny, given how wrong Holtz-Eakin has been relative to Krugman &#8230; but Krugman can speak for himself, and has, on how wrong the &#8216;we&#8217;re about to become Greece!!!&#8217; crowd has been.  There is, however, one thing he [Holtz-Eakin] is correct about.  Holtz-Eakin is right to say we shouldn&#8217;t listen to some pundits, especially those like himself who have been so wrong about how events would unfold at every step along the way.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Holtz-Eakin does a lot more in the Guardian article that is just plain bad, such as claiming that the so-called  Affordable Care Act &#8220;entitlement&#8221; will contribute to the so-called &#8220;entitlement problem,&#8221; which will contribute to the &#8220;serious&#8221; problem that the &#8220;deficit orthodoxy&#8221; won&#8217;t acknowledge.  He then hammers on the right-wing orthodoxy&#8217;s pet do-away-with-it-if-we-can projects&#8211;Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, suggesting that &#8220;serious debt reform&#8221; requires &#8220;serious entitlement reform.&#8221;  </p>
<p>As I noted in another recent post, right-wingers like Holtz-Eakin love to talk about safety net programs as &#8220;entitlements&#8221;, whereas they talk about entitlements for the rich and MNEs, such as the percentage depletion allowance, the preferential capital gains rate, and the various subsidies that have handed outsize profits to big banks as though they were rightfully merited acknowledgements of the good those institutions do the rest of us! The talk about these safety net programs, when entering into a right-winger&#8217;s discussion of fiscal issues, is always lopsided.  It is always how we need to cut back on them, and never about how we need to consider if the programs are worthy, the funding currently provided needed or even currently inadequate, and, if the answer is yes, what means make sense, in a sustainable democracy to serve the people, to ensure the ongoing viability of the safety net.  Not reducing benefits but increasing revenues and decreasing rent-profit-taking. </p>
<p>So  Holtz-Eakin fails to acknowledge that actually the Affordable Care Act is a first step in addressing otherwise mushrooming health care costs which occur because we treat health care as a ripe field for rent-seekers to make rentier profits rather than acknowledging (like other advanced countries) that health care is at least a quasi-public good that must be heavily regulated to ensure accessibility.  And like all the right-wingers pushing the hand-wringing worry over deficits for which their own policies are the primary cause, Holtz-Eakin suggests that the core of what we have to do is, quelle surpise, &#8220;spending cuts and deficit control&#8221;, since &#8220;doing nothing or worse, increasing spending, is a profoundly anti-growth strategy.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>This is the doubling-down on failed policy orthodoxy that Americans should reject out of hand.  Spending cuts and efforts at &#8220;deficit control&#8221; that focus on taking away health care and pension benefits from retirees and others dependent on the safety net are perfect prescriptions for disaster.  We aren&#8217;t Greece.  But if the right-wingers like Holtz-Eakin get their way, we will be.</strong></p>
