                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As I have noted in <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2013/01/the-fiscal-cliff-and-coming-retirement.html">three</a> <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2013/01/us-already-has-high-elder-poverty-rate.html">recent</a> <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2013/01/66-trillion-retirement-savings.html">posts</a>,  retirement security for those currently or recently in the middle class  is no sure thing. 49% of the private work force has neither defined  benefit (traditional pensions) or defined contribution (401(k))  retirement plans, while public sector pensions are coming under  increasing attack. The United States has the highest elder poverty rate,  25% (measured as 50% of median income), of any industrialized nation  bigger than Ireland. An estimated $6.6 trillion shortfall in retirement  savings shows how the shift from traditional pensions to 401(k) plans  has been totally inadequate to meet people&#8217;s future needs.</p>
<p>Yet  what passes for wisdom among the Very Serious People (VSP) is that we  need to make a stealth cut to Social Security via a less generous  inflation adjustment, while Republican plans for Medicare would <a href="http://www.cepr.net/documents/publications/ryan-waste-2011-04.pdf">shift an astounding $34 trillion</a> in medical costs on to seniors whose income would be falling in real terms. This is a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>So  what do we really need to do now? Several different proposals are  currently in the mix, all of which would address the income shortfall to  varying degrees.</p>
<p>Iowa Senator Tom Harkin, chair of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, released <a href="http://www.harkin.senate.gov/documents/pdf/5011b69191eb4.pdf">a report</a> in July 2012, &#8220;The Retirement Crisis and a Plan to Solve It.&#8221; It  proposes a fairly small increase to Social Security benefits (about $60  monthly to the lowest earners) and replaces the current inflation factor  (CPI-Urban wage earners) not with the chintzy &#8220;chained CPI&#8221; the VSP  want, but with the <i>more</i> generous CPI-Elderly, which recognizes  that seniors consume a larger share of rapidly rising cost products,  most obviously health care. The other innovation in the Harkin plan is  the introduction of &#8220;USA&#8221; (Universal, Secure, and Adaptable) retirement  funds which would require both employer and employee contributions, with  special tax credits for low-income workers. These funds would provide  what might be called a &#8220;semi-defined benefit&#8221; that could be adjusted  downward if there were a prolonged stock market slump, but otherwise  would provide a predictable level of benefit to its recipients.</p>
<p>As pension expert <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jane-white/the-senates-plan-for-our-retirement_b_1716999.html">Jane White</a> contends, this proposal is vague when it is not simply inadequate. She  argues for a plan like the Australian &#8220;Superannuation&#8221; plan, where  employers are required to put in 9% of the worker&#8217;s income. Her proposal  for the U.S. would be a 9% contribution for large companies and 6% for  small firms. It would be portable among companies, and employees would  immediately own their employer&#8217;s contribution (vesting), in contrast to  the current situation where that can take years. She argues that the big  problem with U.S. pensions isn&#8217;t that not enough people have 401(k)&#8217;s  (though with 49% of private workers not having one, I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;m  persuaded), but that the employer contribution is so small. By contrast,  Harkin&#8217;s USA plan does not specify a level of employer contributions,  which is definitely a drawback when the savings shortfall is so severe.</p>
<p>Of  course, White&#8217;s proposal still subjects retirement funds to market risk  that Social Security does not, and gives Wall Street a huge new pool of  funds to play with. One logical alternative is simply a dramatic  expansion of Social Security. Obviously, it is already portable between  employers, and companies already have to deduct FICA and Medicare taxes,  so there would be no difference administratively from what firms  already do.</p>
<p>The funding would come from an end to the  cap on earnings subject to the Social Security tax, currently $113,700  for 2013. A little-known fact is that while the payroll tax is  regressive (flat to the cap, then 0), the payout structure counteracts  this by reducing the share of earnings replaced in retirement the  greater the person&#8217;s income. As the Harkin report  explains:<br />
<blockquote>The  replacement factor for a person’s first $767 of Average Indexed Monthly  Earnings (“AIME”) is 90%. The replacement factor drops to 32% for AIME  between $767 and $4,624 and 15% for AIME between $4,624 and $8,532.</p></blockquote>
<p> The  report goes on to propose a replacement factor of just 5% for income  over the current cap. It further reports that Social Security only  replaces an average of 40% of people&#8217;s pre-retirement income, rather  than the 65-85% that is widely recommended for retirees.</p>
<p>This  suggests an obvious solution: increase the replacement factor  substantially for middle-income people. While the numbers would need to  be worked out precisely, middle class workers would be much more secure  with, for example, 100% replacement of their first $2000 per month in  income, 50% replacement of their next $2000 per month in income, 25% for  the rest up to the current cap, and then Harkin&#8217;s proposed 5% over the  current cap.</p>
<p>When I say &#8220;obvious,&#8221; that&#8217;s not to say  that it will be easy. Republicans still want to gut Social Security,  even though it is supported by most Americans. But a deeper problem is  that few people realize just how severe the retirement crisis will be,  first for younger Baby Boomers, but much more so for their children and  grandchildren. As a first step, you should follow White&#8217;s suggestion to  contact Harkin&#8217;s committee asking for hearings on the coming crisis. The  email is <a href="mailto:Retirement_Security@help.senate.gov">Retirement_Security@help.senate.gov</a></p>
<p>But we will need many more steps to ensure that the crisis is solved in our lifetimes.</p>

<p> More on PTINs for previously unregulated tax return preparers</p>
<p> After considering the problems caused by incompetent or fraudulent tax return preparers who were not attorneys, accountants or admitted to practice before the IRS as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrolled_agent">enrolled agents</a>, the IRS released a study in 2010 on tax return preparation with recommendations for regulation of the industry. Amendments to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_230">Circular 230</a>, the set of regulations providing standards for &#8220;practice&#8221; before the IRS under 31 U.S.C. section 330 (originally enacted in 1884), set forth various requirements to bring formerly unregulated tax return preparers under a set of standards, including use of preparer tax identification numbers (PTINs), competency testing, continuing education, and standards for the various work done in tax preparation. </p>
<p>Three tax return preparers that would be subject to those rules sued claiming that the new rules were beyond the IRS&#8217;s authority. In Loving v. IRS, No. 12-385, 2013 WL 204667 (D.D.C. Jan. 18, 2013); ECF No. 21 (Order), the United States district court for the District of Columbia found in their favor, granting both declaratory and injunctive relief on the basis that tax return preparers do not &#8220;practice&#8221; before the IRS and hence cannot be regulated under the statute. </p>
<p>The IRS moved quickly for a stay of the injunction against enforcement of the tax return preparer regulations pending appeal to the D.C. Circuit. That motion was denied, but the court did modify the injunction &#8220;to make clear that its requirements are less burdensome than the IRS claims.&#8221; See <a href="https://checkpoint.riag.com/app/view/frameBlob?DocID=ia875c0d4ddcb432fefa3edb2a586342b&#038;dbName=NEWSLTR&#038;feature=tnews&#038;lastCpReqId=2340887&#038;linkType=docloc&#038;locId=wa032212_14&#038;pinpnt=AFTRS04%3A75884.2011-523-EPG1142&#038;practice=-1&#038;tabPg=1270&#038;tagName=PAR&#038;action=validateBlob&#038;BLOBID=%2Fresource%2FTX%2Flovmem-opin_020413">Loving v. IRS</a>, No. 12-385 (D.D.C. Feb. 1, 2013) (link here is to BNA).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The court acknowledges that Congress specifically authorized the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preparer_Tax_Identification_Number">PTIN</a> schema by statute in 26 U.S.C. section 6109(a)(4). The court claims that the PTIN provision does not fall within the scope of the injunction and the IRS may continue to provide PTINs, but it cannot condition eligibility on authorization to practice under the various conditions set out in Circular 230 as required in final regulation 1.6109-2(d). The court has enjhoined the requirement that tax return preparers who are not attorneys, CPAs, enrolled agents or enrolled actuaries must pay fees, pass a qualifying exam, and complete continuing education requirements.</p>
<p>It is to be hoped that the Circuit Court will quickly overturn this overreaching district court&#8217;s &#8220;stuck in the past&#8221; interpretation of the 1884 statute. If that doesn&#8217;t happen immediately, then Congress should act expeditiously to &#8220;clarify&#8221; current law by providing that the PTIN provision includes the ability of the IRS to regulate tax return preparation and that tax return preparation constitutes practice before the IRS. We have seen considerable evidence of tax return preparers who do not understand the tax laws or who intentionally misapply them (in the home office deduction, etc.). It is imperative that those who assist others in preparing tax returns demonstrate minimal competency in the tax law as demonstrated by the qualifying exam.</p>

<p>DEAR PAUL KRUGMAN<br />Please Read This <br />about Social Security</p>
<p>Dear Paul Krugman,</p>
<p>There was an indication the other day that you read Angry Bear, at least sometimes. I hope you read this, because it is important, and you have a better forum than I have.</p>
<p>I think the following facts would be game changers in the so-called &#8220;debate&#8221; about Social Security, if they become widely known and understood.</p>
<p>Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit&#8230; <br />In spite of tortured logic like that of Chuck Blahous who admitted grudgingly that &#8220;technically&#8221; Social Security does not affect the budget, but &#8220;in reality&#8221; if Congress has to pay back the money it has borrowed from Social Security, that will have an effect on the budget. This amounts to blaming granny for lending me her life savings. After all, if she hadn&#8217;t lent it to me I wouldn&#8217;t have spent it. Therefore it&#8217;s her fault that I have to get a job or borrow money from someone else to pay her back.</p>
<p>&#8230; and therefore should not be part of the &#8220;deficit reduction&#8221; hysteria.<br />Again, in spite of logic so tortured it gives lies a bad name: The serious folks who are so very worried about the deficit sometimes admit that Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit, &#8220;but we need to cut Social Security to give confidence to the markets.” Because even though Social Security has nothing to do with the deficit, cutting it will show &#8220;the market&#8221; that we are serious about controlling our deficit.</p>
<p>Social Security is not going broke.<br />It can&#8217;t go broke. It is paid for by the workers who will get the benefits. As long as they understand the value of protecting part of their savings from inflation and market losses&#8230; insuring at least a minimally decent retirement&#8230; they will want to be allowed to continue to pay for their Social Security.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The Trust Fund is NOT Social Security. It does not matter at all when it &#8220;runs out.&#8221;<br />The Trust Fund is normally a reserve of one year&#8217;s benefits designed to smooth the ebbs and flows of taxes versus benefits. It was allowed to grow following the 1983 increase in the payroll tax to about three times the normal size in order to allow the Boomers to help pay in advance for their own Social Security benefits beyond what would normally be paid by &#8220;pay as you go&#8221; financing. This corrected a potential &#8220;generational inequity.&#8221; This enlarged Trust Fund was always supposed to run out of money about the time the Boomer cohort no longer put unusual stress on the pay as you go system. So far it is on schedule to do exactly that. The precise date that the Trust Fund returns to the normal level is completely unimportant to Social Security.</p>
<p>The &#8220;Eight Trillion Dollar Actuarial Deficit&#8221; can be paid for by raising the payroll tax eighty cents per week each year.<br />This is a fact that can be established with certainty with real arithmetic (real arithmetic is not the “it&#8217;s just arithmetic” you hear about from journalists and congressmen who have no idea what they are talking about). Raising the payroll tax one half of one tenth of one percent per year&#8230; about forty cents per week in today&#8217;s terms &#8230; would entirely close the projected actuarial deficit over the 75 year actuarial window. Wages are projected by the same Trustees Report to rise about eight dollars per week each year over the same time period. So at the end of the day the workers will have twice as much money in their pockets AFTER paying for their Social Security, plus they will have guaranteed their own retirement at the normal retirement age with the present replacement rate&#8230; an amount that will also be twice in real value what today&#8217;s retirees get. Because of the recent recession, it would be better to raise the tax eighty cents per week each year over the next twenty years instead of at the slower rate. Eighty cents per week would still not be felt by the workers.<br />Social Security was designed&#8230;insisted upon by Roosevelt&#8230;to be worker paid: &#8220;So that no damn politician can take it away from them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roosevelt did not count on the persistence of damn politicians, or the bad memories of workers, or the failure of the &#8220;defenders of Social Security&#8221; to honestly inform the workers. The workers will be glad to pay that eighty cents once they know about it, and understand it. The &#8220;defenders&#8221; of Social Security play into the hands of its enemies by calling for schemes to &#8220;make the rich pay for it.&#8221; Roosevelt knew that would be the death of Social Security. The rich will not pay for it. Or if they did, they would own it, and it would not be long before they would insist upon cutting it, turning it into welfare, and means testing it. And the workers would no longer be able to say&#8230; as they do now&#8230; “we paid for it ourselves.”</p>
<p>The &#8220;bi-partisan groups worried about the deficit&#8221;&#8230; which means folks paid by Peter Peterson to destroy Social Security by pretending Social Security is causing the deficit&#8230; tell very carefully crafted lies about Social Security. The people who style themselves defenders of Social Security waste their time deconstructing the little lies, while the Big Lie goes unanswered. One of those people apparently believes that &#8220;doing nothing&#8221; is the answer. He seems to believe that something will turn up that will extend the life of the Trust Fund and silence the calls for &#8220;fixing&#8221; Social Security. He could be right&#8230; the best &#8220;fix&#8221; for Social Security would be to raise the wages of workers. But this is not something we can realistically expect to accomplish in any reasonable time. And the Big Liars are not going to wait. Unless we can offer a realistic plan, that people can understand, to pay for the projected Social Security actuarial deficit, the Big Liars will push forward their &#8220;fixes&#8221; that are designed to destroy Social Security.</p>
<p>The Big Lie is that &#8220;Social Security is going broke, causing huge deficits that will burden our children.&#8221;</p>
<p>Social Security is not going broke. It has nothing to do with the deficit. The workers pay for it themselves. They can always pay for it themselves. If the costs of retirement rise as they are expected to, the cost of Social Security will rise&#8230;. about eighty cents per week per year. This is not a burden on the young. It is money they will get back with interest when they need it most. It is in fact the best deal that workers have ever had.</p>
<p>Tell the people.</p>

                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">When it comes to the most important economic challenges facing the nation, President Obama offers soaring rhetoric. He campaigned vigorously against the decline of the middle class. He launched his new term this past week with a speech declaring widespread prosperity to be a deeply American virtue — and a threatened one.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else,” Obama said in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/president-obamas-second-inaugural-address-transcript/2013/01/21/f148d234-63d6-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html">his second inaugural address</a>, “because she is an American; she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Then he talked a little about tax reform.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Of course, cleaning up and simplifying a complicated tax code is important. But it is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a cure for widening inequality and declining economic mobility. This is the problem with the president’s approach to America’s big economic problems: His rhetoric seems way ahead of his policy proposals.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">There are several reasons for that, including the complexity of the challenges at hand, the polarized political climate and the difficulty of crafting comprehensive solutions (let alone poll-tested ones). But the simplest explanation is that Obama’s economic team is built to tackle a totally different set of issues than the ones the president loves to talk about. It is built largely to address the problems of the federal budget deficit.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obama-wants-to-tackle-poverty-and-inequality-so-why-is-his-economic-team-so-focused-on-the-deficit/2013/01/25/d6b03482-667c-11e2-93e1-475791032daf_print.html">Obama wants to tackle poverty and inequality. So why is his economic team so focused on the deficit?</a>, Jim Tankersley, Washington Post, Jan. 25</div>
<p>One of my great disappointments, and a cause of utter dismay at times, of Obama’s first term was his near-total failure to bring into his administration really brilliant academics, and (apparently) to actually listen to the ones he did bring in.  I remember back in early 2009 how happy I was that Obama was going to pursue major healthcare insurance reform, right at the outset, and I assumed that he would enlist the assistance of two or three of the most prominent academics who had extensive background related to healthcare financing.  Which, in my opinion, meant, first and foremost, <a href="http://wws.princeton.edu/people/display_person.xml?netid=reinhard&#038;display=core">Uwe Reinhardt</a>, the James Madison Professor of Political Economy at Princeton’s Economics and Public Affairs departments.  </p>
<p>I sort of had this vision of Reinhardt and <a href="http://www.gailwilensky.com/">Gail Wilensky</a>, the moderate Republican healthcare economist who had served as George H. W. Bush’s Medicare director, joining together at Obama’s request to draft a potential healthcare insurance bill. </p>
<p>Instead, of course, Obama left it up to Max Baucus and a few other members of Congress to draft a bill from scratch, and then failed to aggressively explain its contents and refute the massive campaign of disinformation about it.  Sort of like his method of handling the stimulus legislation. Thus, the 2010 election results. </p>
<p>But healthcare costs and related issues are deeply entwined with economic and labor issues, and Reinhardt’s expertise is not limited to healthcare costs and delivery. He is not per se a labor economist, but he is per se brilliant and possessed of the ability to explain complex facts to the economics-and-healthcare-finance-challenged crowd.  (Trust me on this.) </p>
<p>A huge difference between now and any time during the past four years is that, finally, suddenly, some mainstream journalists and pundits are joining Paul Krugman in awakening to the facts highlighted in the above indented excerpt by Jim Tankersley.  In mainstream print journalism, it may still be just the editorial writers at the New York Times and economics correspondents at the Washington Post, but I’m betting that it’s about to gain real steam.  </p>
<p>The Times editorial I’m referring to <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/obama-wants-to-tackle-poverty-and-inequality-so-why-is-his-economic-team-so-focused-on-the-deficit/2013/01/25/d6b03482-667c-11e2-93e1-475791032daf_print.html">is in today’s paper</a>, and argues:</p>
<div dir="ltr">In recent years, the administration and Congress have been consumed with deficit reduction, which is antithetical to job creation because it curbs government spending when the economy is weak. Unless Mr. Obama can shift policy away from premature austerity and toward ways to bolster demand and foster investment, job growth will remain sluggish and unemployment high.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">What has been missing for years is a forceful labor agenda — one that calls for more jobs, but also has as its goal rising wages coupled with robust hiring.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Mr. Obama can take an important step in that direction by placing his next labor secretary at the center of his economic team. The first-term labor secretary, Hilda Solis, was largely sidelined, a reflection of the administration’s focus on the recovery of Wall Street, not Main Street. Some of the names that have been floated for the job — including Jennifer Granholm, the former governor of Michigan — show that Mr. Obama is seeking someone of high stature, but any secretary’s ability to be a transformative force will depend on the president’s support.</div>
<p>I agree that if Obama limits his options for this post to past or present politicians and people already, or recently, in government, then Granholm is an excellent choice.  But I think it’s past time now for him to look elsewhere, to academia, to fill a post that has the potential to make a defining contribution to critical economic and labor policy.  </p>
<p>I fear, of course, that Reinhardt is the wrong gender.  Obama needs to place women in prominent positions in his administration, after all.  And there may well be a terrific labor economist who is female; I wouldn’t know.  But even more than placing women in prominent positions in his administration, he needs to place someone with a deep understanding of national and international labor and economics dynamics in a position of real influence and public exposure.</p>

<p>Health Care Thoughts: Law of Unintended Consequences</p>
<p>Unions have been enthusiastic supporters of Obamacare.</p>
<p>But not all unions and not all unions benefits are the same. Unions with lower income members are suddenly discovering the PPACA deal is not so great for everyone.</p>
<p>Lower income workers with union plans will not be eligible for subsidies, and now the unions want to change the rules. Unions lobbied for this early on but were denied by the Obama administration. <br />(There is no monopoly on self-interest here, some large businesses (think Wal-Mart) will be maneuvering to dump workers into state Medicaid plans.)</p>
<p>Employers with union plans are paying higher premiums as the working class pays for improvement in coverage mandated by PPACA. This can be critical in bid areas such as construction.  Unintended consequences can be quite cruel.</p>

                                <p>In further follow-up to my post of yesterday (I already appended the original post yesterday) called, “<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/02/stories-that-will-continue-to-get-far.html">Stories That Will Continue to Get Far Too Little Attention As Long As Obama Allows Them To.</a>”: Reader coberly and I exchanged the following further comments in the Comments thread:</p>
<div dir="ltr">coberly: </p>

<div dir="ltr">just to ease your heart, i agree that the overdraft fees are gouging.</div>
<div dir="ltr">and i even understand that some people can&#8217;t do arithmetic.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">so i am all for the reforms.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">nevertheless, it is better to know what you have in the bank before you write that check or whatever it is you do with ATM&#8217;s. And certainly better not to run too close to the edge.</div>
<p>

<div dir="ltr">Yes, Dale. It’s definitely better to do things that way. But, trying to get serious here, because it’s actually a serious matter, the ubiquitous use of debit/credit cards because they’ve effectively replaced cash and checks, and the fact that many millions of people do live on tight budgets, allowed the banks to be grossly abusive in their handling of small, very-short-term overdrafts.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">My point is that the new law has been a big deal to a lot of people, some of whom tell pollsters, when asked, that they want “small government” and who vote Republican because of “freedom!” “liberty!” So maybe someone should tell them what the Republicans actually stand for. Freedom! Liberty! And what the Dems’ idea of “big government” actually is.</div>
<p>The intended point of my original post was that if Obama and the congressional Dems and want to leave a meaningful legacy on economics and finance-related matters&#8211;if they want to finally end the Repubs’ success at defeating or undermining that legacy&#8211;and if they want to regain control of the House in 2014 and tru ly put an end to the profoundly destructive three-decade “conservative-movement” juggernaut that in its current iteration continues to control the mainstream-media conversation and so much of actual policy despite their congressional legislative defeats in 2009 and 2010, and despite their significant popular-vote losses in the presidential, Senate, and House elections last November, the Dems have to engage in a concerted national effort to inform the public about what, in past news-media and political eras, the public would know from observation. </p>
<p>Whew.  That was a long sentence.  I’m out of breath. </p>
<p>But I’m actually not beating a dead horse.  The horse isn’t dead. </p>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.solarguide.co.uk/efficiency-gains-could-make-solar-half-the-price-of-coal-by-2030">Current estimates</a> suggest that solar might be as cheap as coal by the end of the decade, and half the cost of coal by the end of the next decade. When applied to electricity prices this predicts that solar generated electricity in the US will descend to a level of 12 cents (7 pence) per kilowatt hour by 2020, possibly even 2015 for the sunniest parts of America. </p></blockquote>

<p>GDP Gap Stuck at 6%</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EuAq-TIIYY4/UQqNEZTBZNI/AAAAAAAAATU/9iyhlRfXSeA/s1600/a1.jpeg"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-EuAq-TIIYY4/UQqNEZTBZNI/AAAAAAAAATU/9iyhlRfXSeA/s400/a1.jpeg" height="274" width="400"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/data-bytes/gdp-bytes/government-spending-and-inventories-push-graowth-negative">Dean Baker</a> gets it right with respect to the latest news on GDP: <br />
<blockquote>A sharp drop in government spending, heavily concentrated in defense, coupled with a decline in inventories caused GDP to shrink at a 0.1 percent rate in the 4th quarter. Government spending fell at a 6.6 percent annual rate, driven by a 22.2 percent decline in defense spending, subtracting 1.33 percentage points from the growth rate in the quarter. A 40.3 drop in the rate of inventory accumulation reduced growth by another 1.27 percentage points. Without these factors, GDP would have grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the quarter. Pulling out these extraordinary factors, the GDP data were largely in line with prior quarters.</p></blockquote>
