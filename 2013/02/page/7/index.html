<blockquote><p>THEIRS MONEY THAT GOES TO MEDICARE AND SOCIAL SECURITY AND I THINK IT IS JUST IS SO  INAPPROPRIATE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES NOT USE THAT AS A TRUST FUND BUT THEY MOVE  IMMEDIATELY TO THE GENERAL FUND  AND STACK UP IOU&#8217;S THAT ARE  SITTING IN A CABINET IN WEST VIRGINIA. </p></blockquote>
<p>What she says should not be allowed to stand and if C-span were half of what it used to be, she would not have had the following go uncorrected.  Thus I leave it to the Angry Bears to correct her here and thus document her ignorance of the subject.  <br /><a href="http://www.c-spanvideo.org/clip/4360645&#038;newclip" target="_blank"></a></p>
<p>I have not watched this lady before.  I could not help but think she is just a more polished version of Sarah Palin. She is totally capable of pulling off what we used to call a &#8220;snow job&#8221; when writing their essay.  </p>

<p>Senator Warren Puts Bank Regulators on Hot Seat</p>
<p> <a href="http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=82">Elizabeth Warren</a> started out her <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2F6YkBa_Tig&#038;feature=player_detailpage">questioning of big bank regulators </a>by noting that actual trials, where guilty parties are paraded before juries, information about their wrongdoing is spread over front pages, and everybody is aware that bad guys get punished for their bad deeds has an effect on whether the wrongdoing is committed in the first place. In the case of the big Wall Street banks, however, she notes that they made out like bandits during the speculative orgy that caused the financial system crisis, and yet not a one has paid by being taken to trial in this expressive way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me,&#8221; she says to a group of bank regulators called before her Senate committee, &#8220;about the last few times you&#8217;ve taken the biggest <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_institution">financial institutions</a> on Wall Street to trial. Anybody?&#8221; </p>
<p>The FCC representative, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Curry">Tom Curry</a>, notes that ordinarily they are just trying to move things along and correct deficiencies. Warren interrupts and notes&#8211;&#8220;yes, and you set a price for that&#8230; that&#8217;s effectively a settlement. What I&#8217;m asking is &#8230; when did you last take a financial institution, a Wall Street Bank, to trial? &#8221; Curry &#8220;We&#8217;ve had a fair number of consent orders. We don&#8217;t have to bring them to trial.&#8221; Warren &#8220;I understand that you say you don&#8217;t &#8220;have&#8221; to but my question is when is the last time that you did?&#8221; (No further responsive answer). </p>
<p>(Dan here&#8230;a clip of her at the committee meeting is below the fold)</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The same kind of interchange&#8211;can you identify when you last took Wall Street Banks to trial &#8211;was similarly nonresponded to by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elisse_B._Walter">Elisse Walter</a>. Nobody else even offered to comment. Certainly nobody offered a single date for &#8220;last time a Wall Street bank was taken to trial.&#8221; </p>
<p>Warren closed with a comment that made clear that she thought that a very different standard was being applied to Wall Street than is applied to ordinary citizens that commit even minor infractions. She noted that there are District Attorneys every day squeezing ordinary citizens on rather small matters and taking them to trial explicitly to set an example, but &#8220;For Wall Street banks, &#8216;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Too_big_to_fail">too big to fail</a>&#8216; has become &#8216;too big to try [take to trial]&#8217;. That just seems wrong to me.&#8221;</p>
<p>You go, Elizabeth. Without using the words &#8220;class warfare&#8221;, she has made absolutely crystal clear the class warfare problem that exists in our country today, where Wall Street institutions and their chiefs and chief owners get all kinds of protections while the little guy is shaken down for peanuts. As a commenter on the site already noted, if only there were 99 more like her in the Senate&#8230;..</p>

                                <p>By “this,” I mean <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/13/marco-rubio-finances_n_2678744.html">this</a>.  I don’t know, but it sounds to me like some of it is not.  </p>
<p>Wish I could ask Chris Christie, a former (very high-profile) U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey (2001-2008).  He would know.  </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE:  In light of the comments to this post, saying that Florida law allows the type of influence-peddling that Rubio has engaged in (presumably, unless there’s some overt quid pro quo)&#8211;something that the article I linked to does make clear&#8211;I want to clarify what I think may be illegal (i.e., violate federal law, thus my reference to Chris Christie).  From the article: </p>
<div dir="ltr">For Rubio, a rising star in the Republican Party, more government did indeed create more opportunities. As <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/marco-rubios-personal-finances-clash-with-call-for-fiscal-discipline/1129566">the Tampa Bay Times</a> reported during his U.S. Senate run in 2010, it&#8217;s hard to determine with Rubio where politics stops and the private begins:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">As Rubio climbed the ranks, he began to use little-noticed political committees to fund his travel and other expenses and later had a Republican Party of Florida credit card.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">What emerged, records show, is a pattern of blending personal and political spending. Over and over again Rubio proved sloppy, at best, in complying with disclosure requirements.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Virtually broke, the 31-year-old lawmaker began campaigning to be House speaker in 2003 and created a political committee &#8212; Floridians for Conservative Leadership &#8212; to help elect other Republican candidates and curry their support.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">With his wife serving as treasurer, Rubio did not wait for the state to authorize the committee before accepting campaign donations.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The committee listed its address as Rubio&#8217;s home, a modest place he and his wife bought in West Miami in 2002, but reported spending nearly $85,000 in office and operating costs and $65,000 for administrative costs.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Over 18 months, nearly $90,000 went for political consultants, $51,000 went for credit card payments and $4,000 went to other candidates. That&#8217;s less than the $5,700 that went to his wife, Jeanette, much of it for &#8220;gas and meals.&#8221; (Mrs. Rubio does not work and the couple file joint tax returns.)</div>

<p>Some of this sounds to me like taxable (but probably undeclared) income for him and his wife, beyond just his wife’s salary and actual expenses related to the PAC.  The PAC also sounds like it was largely a fraud; its stated purpose was to help elect other Republicans to the state legislature, and I guess some of the consulting was used by or for other candidates, although the article doesn’t make that clear, but just a tiny percentage of the donations were given to other candidates.</p>
<p>But also, two other things the article mentions sound like they violate federal law:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Rubio <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/rubios-campaign-image-belies-history-of-250-million-in-pork-requests/1078548">earmarked money</a> to Florida International University and later got an unadvertised job as a part-time professor at the school. The former school president, Mitch Maidique, said Rubio was &#8220;worth every penny.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">After appropriating millions of dollars to Miami Children&#8217;s and Jackson Memorial Hospitals, Rubio formed a lobby shop and<a href="http://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/RubioHerald.pdf"> got contracts</a> with the hospitals.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of these things sound like things that Jesse Jackson Jr. and his wife <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/jesse-jackson-jr-to-plead-guilty-to-federal-charges-87716.html?hp=f3">were formally charged with yesterday</a>, albeit on a much quieter scale, and some of the other things sound similar in nature, if not scale, to what former Illinois governor Rod Blagojevich was convicted of.  </p>

Past AB posts have followed the concerns of Americans early on, and address market issues where the price per barrel appears to be (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2005/04/oil-impact-on-us-economy.html">Bill McBride</a>) much lower and variable from the Middle East and Texas sweet, and also of the much more limited  quantities than promised in Tom Bozzo&#8217;s <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/08/on-cornucopian-views-of-oil-supplies.html">On Cornucopian Views of Oil Supplies</a> ,  and claims of  (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/06/employmnet-in-oil-gas-drilling.html">Spencer England</a> ) significant jobs growth for the industry.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Chris Martenson: </strong>Well, this is really important. The current story is something along these lines: &#8220;Hey, look at how clever we&#8217;ve been. Because of the magic of technology, we have discovered how to unlock these incredible oil and gas resources that we just didn&#8217;t even know about before.&#8221;<br />When I talk to people who are in the oil business, they say, &#8220;Oh, no, no, we&#8217;ve known about those shale deposits, we&#8217;ve been drilling into and through them for decades. We&#8217;ve had horizontal drilling for decades; we&#8217;ve had fracking for decades. What we haven&#8217;t had is $80-a-barrel oil reliably enough to support us going into those with those technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>So what really unlocked those reserves was price. Not technology, not cleverness, not ingenuity. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there&#8217;s a lot of very clever, ingenious stuff going on in those drilling actions, but price was the primary driver here.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Here&#8217;s the thing, though: When more expensive energy comes out of the ground, it means that everything that you use to go get that energy, after a lag, becomes more expensive too. This is doubly compounded by this idea that there&#8217;s less net energy coming from these finds.</p>
<p>They use more energy to get that energy, but that more energy is more expensive. So that feedback loop is already in play here. It simply means that there&#8217;s less to be used as we like elsewhere in the economy.<br />When I look at America&#8217;s apparent energy abundance</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little worried that it&#8217;s been oversold. In particular, the dynamics of depletion that exist in both the tight shale oil and shale gas plays are very different from conventional reservoir depletion dynamics. I&#8217;m concerned that people are accustomed to the old and relatively slow reservoir depletion dynamics and are lulled by the sharp increases in output that these new reservoirs offer without really understanding just how rapidly they fall off as well.<br />Here&#8217;s an example, in the Barnett shale gas play, in one region where they drilled 9,000 wells, there was just this exponential increase in gas output. But then there was no more room for any more wells in that section, and within one single year the gas output from that region with all of those beautiful, technologically marvelous 9,000wells had fallen by 44%. One year!<br />So as long as America can continue to forever increase the number of wells that it&#8217;s completing and bringing online every year, it will be able to maintain rising production from the shale plays. Obviously that&#8217;s an impossibility. You run out of space eventually, you don&#8217;t have enough rigs or talent to drill incrementally more wells each year, or the capital just isn&#8217;t there for some reason. Sooner or later, there are only so many wells you can complete. At that point, we discover that the rapid increases in oil production almost immediately begin to drop. And this is a whole new dynamic. I think we need to build in a little caution for ourselves around this story that seems to be almost completely missing from most mainstream news reports.<br />So really, we&#8217;re on a very elaborate treadmill right now, where as long as we can continue to drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, drill, then we&#8217;ll get an increasing output. I&#8217;m not convinced that that&#8217;s going to happen.<br />There are a number of factors that will cause that to slow. One is environmental concern. Another is, I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re going to have the capital to do that forever. A third is that we&#8217;ve already drilled through all of the known sweet spots in these plays, and so we&#8217;re down to the more marginal portions of the main plays. The wells going into the less-than-sweet spots are going to require higher energy prices to break even than did the initial wells. And fundamentally, sooner or later, you just run out of places to put new wells.<br />The biggest problem I have with how the shale story is being sold is it is being used to justify a blind resumption of business-as-usual and I think we really need to be asking some deeper questions of ourselves because eventually even these plays will run out too. I say we should have a distinct and well thought out plan for how we want to use the potential work those resources represent to build ourselves the finest country energy can supply.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>In other words, when costs are distributed over a large group, older adults save more than younger adults lose.</p>
<p>Still, many believe that older Boomers can and should pick up the higher tab for their own care. After all, throughout their financial lives, they have been luckier than most: they enjoyed first crack at the employment market when jobs were plentiful, and first dibs on housing when homes were affordable.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Yet in recent years, the economy has not been kind to the rock ‘n roll generation. One in six is now unemployed, and from 2000 to 2011, the average (mean) after-tax income of Americans age 45 to 54 (who are now in their 50s and early 60s) <a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/updates/Household-Incomes-by-Age-Brackets.php">plunged by 13.3 percent</a>.</p>
<p>By that measure, the recession has hit them harder than other age groups except Americans aged 15 to 24. Over those years, this cohort should have been enjoying their peak earning years. But as <a href="http://www.advisorperspectives.com/dshort/charts/census/household-income-age-brackets.html?household-income-age-45-54-mean-real-growth.gif">the chart below reveals</a>, they didn’t.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RlS-9tu562Y/UR4aUozDPBI/AAAAAAAABgc/EPUnBjRdAKU/s1600/household-income-by-age-bracket-mean-real.gif" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-RlS-9tu562Y/UR4aUozDPBI/AAAAAAAABgc/EPUnBjRdAKU/s320/household-income-by-age-bracket-mean-real.gif"></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Yet there’s a trade off: if age rating were abolished, younger adults would be charged more, and some would decide they can’t afford insurance. Bottom line: “the number of uninsured older Americans would be roughly offset by increases in the number of uninsured adults in the two younger age groups (18-34 and 34-44).”</p>
<p>This worries policymakers for two reasons. First, we need young, healthy Americans in the pool to keep insurance costs down. Secondly, if young families decide to forego insurance, many won’t buy separate policies for the children.<br />How do we choose between children and their grandparents?</p>
<p>If we don’t want to ration care, the only rational solution is to bring down the cost by trimming waste in our health care system. This will be difficult. Most of the fat isn’t hanging out on the edges of the steak – it’s marbled throughout in the form of unnecessary treatments and over-priced products. It needs to be removed carefully, with a scalpel. But it can be done.</p></blockquote>

<p> Charitable Contribution Deduction&#8211;Camp Hearings Feb 14</p>
<p> Rep. Camp&#8217;s Ways &#038; Means Committee held hearings today on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charitable_organization">charitable contribution</a> deduction. To watch the hearings, you can go to <a href="http://www.ustream.tv/channel/hclive09#/recorded/29283882">this website</a>. Camp is planning a tax code rewrite, which he says is intended to lower rates, simplify the code, and curb some tax breaks. <br />Regarding those Camp objectives&#8211;they are not generally the right ones.
<ul>
<li><strong>Lowering rates is the wrong objective</strong>.  We already have very very low tax rates, especially when you consider that we do not have a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value-added_tax">VAT</a>alongside the income tax as most European countries do.  The primary motivation for lowering rates appears to be to cut revenues even more, in another ratcheting up cycle of the GOP &#8220;starve the beast&#8221; game.  Lowering rates allows wealthy taxpayers and corporations to retain more of their profits, when they already garner a higher share of that income than average Americans who toil in their businesses as regular employees.  Lowering rates also results in less revenues and increased borrowing, resulting in higher deficits and higher debt, contributing to the right-wing demand for cutting safety net programs like unemployment insurance, Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. </li>
<li><strong>Simplifying the Code is the wrong objective</strong>.  About 70% of US individual taxpayers do not itemize, meaning that their tax returns are quite simple.  For the 30% of taxpayers who do itemize, the complexity is necessary to prevent scams, manipulation and unreasonable subsidization of those who don&#8217;t need it.  A tax system intended to cover the many complex transactions of today&#8217;s globalized economies cannot be simple without being naive. </li>
<li><strong>Curbing some tax breaks is a good idea. </strong> But it should be more than &#8220;some&#8221; and it should be vigorously done to shift the tax burden towards the upper class and business and away from those in the lower and lower-middle income distributions.  The tax breaks that should be curbed are the ones that are most regressive in nature&#8211;i.e., the ones that provide the majority benefit to the very rich.</li>
</ul>
<p>The hearing today included lots of representatives of charities who were arguing their interest&#8211;keeping the tax-incentivized flow of money coming.  The typical argument from charities is that the tax deduction is necessary to incentivize the transfer of money to charities.  If it weren&#8217;t there, the argument goes, rich people might not give at all, or at least not nearly so much money. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There&#8217;s not a whole lot of empirical evidence to back this up.  On the one hand, there are studies showing that  non-rich people give much more of their limited assets away, proportionately, than the richest people (though of course it amounts to much less in absolute dollars), and many of them don&#8217;t get any break at all because they don&#8217;t itemize. Furthermore, rich people like the names-on-gold-plates-on-opera-house-chairs a heck of a lot, too.  Maybe they give most of the money they give because of the status, the recognition, the remembrance-in-perpetuity, and to get to attend the events they&#8217;ve sponsored, which are usually the kinds of cultural events that they enjoy (opera, ballet, elite art museums, etc.).  Does what a rich person says about why he gives hold a lot of weight in this debate?  I&#8217;d argue it should not, since those who give typically want to be thought of as important philanthropists and not as status-greedy opportunists who are just giving the minimum amount to get their name and face plastered all over the New York Times&#8230;..</p>
<p>Does the tax incentive come into play in determining how much a person will give?  Indubitably.  But it isn&#8217;t clear that people who want to give $20 million to their alma matter wouldn&#8217;t do so even without the charitable contribution deduction!  All that put together suggests that the deduction is highly inefficient.  Most rich people would give money anyway to the things that bring them prestige and status and recognition and that accomplish what they want to accomplish now that they are rich and can afford to spread money around.</p>
<p>In addition to the inefficiency of the charitable contribution deduction&#8211;at least in amounts above some reasonable amount to allow to those who are NOT in the top quintile (say, 10%  of  adjusted gross income), there is also the problem that the deduction is primarily beneficial to the very wealthy.  They pay tax at the highest rates (well, except when the system doesn&#8217;t work well because they have mostly preferentially taxed capital gains) and they get the most bang from the buck for the dollars they contribute.  They invariably itemize, whereas most lower-bracket taxpayers do not.  They give in ways that gives them prestige (there is really a quid pro quo for much of their giving, though it may not be financial).</p>
<p>Another complaint from charities and wealthy donors is that the absence of a charitable contribution deduction will result in the government just taking all that money that would have otherwise gone to the charity, because of higher taxes.  The implication is that such a result is disastrous, putting the recipients of the charity&#8217;s charitableness at risk.  But the truth is otherwise.  The government may be more likely to support the poor and downtrodden than the wealthy are through charitable donations.  How many wealthy are making contributions to Museums and Opera Houses and Elite Universities, versus a local homeless shelter or similar programs for the needy?  And the decision of what to support, when made by a democratically chosen government, should more accurately reflect the will of the people than the decision of the one (wealthy) donor who gets the tax benefit of a deduction (though of course in these days of partisan gridlock and GOP obstructionism, that is regretably less true).  Shouldn&#8217;t democracies favor taxation and redistribution via program selection over subsidizing the wealthy&#8217;s favored charities?</p>
<p>So some new, reasonable limits on the charitable contribution deduction make a lot of sense from the perspective of democratic egalitarianism.   My suggestion would be to limit the deduction to  10% of the adjusted gross income reported on the tax return. (Ideally, such a modification to the deduction would be accompanied by a rethinking of the estate tax, to limit the amount that can be passed on to heirs without tax to an amount that more or less approximates the average estate of a taxpayer in the fourth quintile of the distribution.)</p>
<p>What about other changes that would be easier to pass and make lots of sense? 
<ul>
<li>Prime amongst them would be the elimination of the fair-market-value deduction (rather than basis) for contributions of certain properties.  This is a sheer giveaway to the wealthy that cannot be justified.  It allows zero basis stock where there is no remaining unrecovered capital investment to be contributed and yield a deduction for the full value, whereas if the person sold the stock, they would at least have to pay capital gains tax on the value.  This provision should simply be deleted from the Code.  That&#8217;s one simplification that would actually result in more fairness. </li>
<li>Another area to tighten is the rules governing private foundations, to prevent the kinds of abuses (where 20 family members receive exorbitant salaries) that give charities a bad name. </li>
<li>And Congress should eliminate the tax giveaway to large corporations (enacted in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Reform_Act_of_1976">Tax Reform Act of 1976</a>) that permits them an enhanced deduction for donations of excess inventory&#8211;a deduction in excess of their cost basis and for more than the value of the inventory.  It&#8217;s not clear that the deduction incentivizes any additional donations&#8211;if a corporation has excess inventory, it will either give it away (which can serve a significant PR function) or sell it at fire-sale prices (which can serve a negative PR function).  IN most cases, it would likely give it away without the enhanced deduction.  Of course, instead of urging Congress to eliminate the large busienss excess inventory special treatment, small businesses (mainly, S corporations with wealthy shareholders) are whining about how tough a time they have and arguing that they should be given a &#8220;level playing field&#8221; by letting them get the enhanced deduction too.  See NAEIR President Gary Smith&#8217;s comments, below (in email).</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>  Congressman Schock and Mr. Smith agree that the bill [H.R. 2592, introduced in the 112th Congres by Schock] would greatly benefit the small business community by establishing parity for S corporations and other small businesses and as such a level playing field with larger regular corporations.  In addition to the principle of fairness inherent in this legislation in the tax benefits it extends to the small business community on par with larger corporations, Mr. Smith notes that <em>“The impact of this legislation must be understood on the grassroots level: promoting </em><strong><em>greater collaboration between businesses and charities</em></strong><em> at the local level.”</em>  In brief, several million struggling small businesses and millions of individuals served by our nation’s charities would benefit through previously unavailable access to a wide variety of free donated products.  (NAEIR email release Feb 14, 2013)<br />Not surprisingly, NAEIR is busy promoting the &#8220;enhanced&#8221; tax deduction (for up to two times the value of the excess inventory) to businesse&#8211;see <a href="http://www.naeir.org/blog/business-taxes-a-deduction-you-might-not-be-aware-of/">here</a>.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>
<div dir="ltr">Yesterday, both sides drew their battle lines in the coming war over the minimum wage. After Obama called for a minimum wage hike in his State of the Union speech, House Republicans dug in against it, casting their opposition as grounded in concern for the plight of low wage workers. John Boehner <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/boehner-shoots-down-obamas-minimum-wage-hike">asked</a>: “Why would we want to make it harder for small employers to hire people?”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/14/the-morning-plum-dems-to-use-minimum-wage-against-gop-in-2014/">Dems to use minimum wage against GOP in 2014</a>, Greg Sargent, Washington Post, this morning</div>
<p>To me, one of the great frustrations in Obama’s failure during most of his first term to communicate, effectively or at all, the basic premises of Keynesian and other liberal economics-related arguments (including on healthcare) was his apparent resistance to mentioning&#8211;early, often, or ever&#8211;specific other countries’ successes or failures that illustrate the point. </p>
<p>But there’s no time like the present for him and the congressional Dems to start to do do this, by maybe mentioning these facts: that Australia’s minimum wage is $15 U.S. and that its unemployment rate is 5.4%, and that the United States has (surprise!) the largest gap between the minimum wage and the median wage of any advanced economy in the world.</p>
<p>I learned those facts yesterday when I read Washington Post columnist <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-raise-the-minimum-wage/2013/02/06/34857264-7066-11e2-8b8d-e0b59a1b8e2a_story.html">Matthew Miller’s Feb. 6 column</a>.  He mentioned it and linked to it in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-obamas-hollow-speech/2013/02/13/d928c944-75a5-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story.html">his column yesterday</a> about Obama’s State of the Union address.  In yesterday’s column, he suggested seemingly, facetiously, that it was his February 6 column that had persuaded Obama to include a minimum-wage-hike proposal in his address.  But after reading the earlier column, I suspect that it was not only what convinced Obama to make the call but also was what caused Obama to even think of it.  </p>
<p>Both of Miller’s columns say that the $9/hr. figure that Obama proposed in his speech would still leave the minimum wage at $1.68 below what the value of the minimum wage was in 1968.  The first column, Miller also mentions that several CEOs of large corporations support a rise in the minimum wage and that a prominent conservative, the editor of American Conservative magazine, suggests raising the minimum wage to $12/hr.  Of course, the Republicans will showcase their own CEOs, and some small-business owners, to support their own position.</p>
<p>Which is where Australia comes in.  Or at least where invoking it should come in. The special beauty of using Australia as an example&#8211;whether in support of an increase in the minimum wage or in refuting the Obamacare-is-socialism/makers-vs.-takers mantra&#8211;is that few Americans associate Australia with, um, socialism.  They associate it instead with free-enterprise economics and a high standard of living.  And soon, hopefully, also with a higher minimum wage that corresponds to a low unemployment rate.  </p>
<p>Maybe Marco Rubio and John Boehner could get a travel discount <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/02/marco-rubio-needs-to-travel-more.html">if they booked their reservations</a> together. </p>

<p> Lew&#8217;s Senate Finance hearing as Treasury Nominee</p>
<p> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_Lew">Jack Lew</a>, former budget director under Clinton and Obama and former Obama chief of staff, answered questions at Senate Finance today in his bid to succeed Tim Geithner as Treasury Secretary.  See, e.g., Rubin &#038; Klimasinska, Lew Says He Didn&#8217;t Know Money-Losing Investment Was in Caymans, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 13, 2013) and other related articles linked below.</p>
<p>When he was first nominated, I noted that I found his candidacy somewhat worrisome.  While there are a number of considerations that suggest a decently competent person, there are also some suggestions of a person who has lived in the &#8220;Wall Street&#8221; flow too long and thus falls into line with the typical Wall Street/mainstream economics thinking&#8211;thinking which ultimately supports policies that will continue to slide towards oligarchy.</p>
<p>The hearing focused on several interesting aspects of Lew&#8217;s career and investment choices.</p>
<p>1) Investing in the Caymans.  Lew made an investment of 50 to 100 thousand in a Citigroup fund based in theCaymans while he was at Citigroup, and claimed that he didn&#8217;t know it was an offshore investment.  He got out of it when he went into government and lost money on it. </p>
<p> ME:  There we have it&#8211;like most rich people, he just didn&#8217;t care enough to consider closely whehter his investment was in a tax haven country and certainly didn&#8217;t ponder the negatives .</p>
<p>2) Compensation at Citigroup.  Lew got a &#8220;bonus&#8221; of $940,000 in January 2009 when Citigroup was receiving federal bailout funds.  He defended it as being paid in the same way other private-sector employees in similar jobs were paid. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>ME:  But there was a ridiculous racheting up of financial sector compensation during the years when the big banks were feeding at the trough of easy mortgage securitization money and derivative speculation.  Shouldn&#8217;t someone that we hire as the head of Treasury have been more aware of that speculative binge?    Or shouldn&#8217;t that person be at least somewhat ashamed now that such an exorbitant &#8220;bonus&#8221; (10 times what most Americans receive in annual pay) should have been funded, in essential part, by taxpayer bailouts of his institution?</p>
<p>Now, Orrin Hatch (GOP-Utah) tried to make a big deal out of Lew overseeing the <a href="http://treasury.gov/fsoc">Financial Stability Oversight Council</a> in administering the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcker_Rule">Volcker Rule</a>limiting proprietary trading, saying that &#8220;it could lead to an awkward situation in which, in your role as chair of the FSOC, you would effectively be saying to financial firms: &#8216;Do as I say, not as I did.&#8217; &#8221;  Hatch claimed that this issue &#8220;bear[s] directly on your qualifications.&#8221;  I&#8217;m not so sure that is such a big worry since I think it is advantageous if Treasury has some understanding of how big banks trade, but it is just one more piece of Lew&#8217;s overall nature of being well-attuned to Wall Street (and not so well-attuned to Main Street).<br />  <br />3)  Corporate taxes.  Lew suggested in the hearing that Republicans and Democrats could &#8220;work together&#8221; so that changes in the international tax scheme could lead to lighter burdens on some foreign income of US multinationals.  The Bloomberg report notes that he supported a global minimum tax, but indicated that could be nominally territorial, with limits on offshoring income to tax haven countries. </p>
<p>4) Earned benefit programs.  Lew is one of those Democrats who is more right of center than the party&#8217;s base.  He still mentions the need for &#8220;entitlement&#8221; program changes as well as additional revenue increases as a part of &#8220;balanced&#8221; deficit reduction.</p>
<p>ME:  This is one of the most disturbing aspects of the Lew nomination.  He is pushing the GOP agenda of deficit reduction and &#8220;entitlement&#8221; reform when instead he should be staunchly defending the New Deal against the oligarchs who want to shrink government, diminish the safety net, end any support for innovative environmental and energy progrms, yet continue to reap benefits from the long-term government subsidies for Big Oil&#8230;..We should not tamper with Social Security&#8211;and there is no deficit reason for doing so. </p>

<div dir="ltr">Mr. President, I still live in the same working-class neighborhood I grew up in. My neighbors aren’t millionaires. They’re retirees who depend on Social Security and Medicare. They’re workers who have to get up early tomorrow morning and go to work to pay the bills. They’re immigrants, who came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy.</div>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; Marco Rubio, last night. </div>
<p>I lifted that quote from <a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=6A9DCC73-62AF-402E-9EED-3F327BE18F7B">a Politico article by Jonathan Martin</a> that went on to say that Rubio left school with more than $100,000 in student-loan debt, which he finished paying off only a few months ago. Presumably, those loans were government-sponsored.  Although maybe at the age of 18, he had some collateral to offer the bank.</p>
<p>Rubio’s parents, like so many of his working-class neighbors now, emigrated from Cuba before 2001, when the first of the two sets of Bush tax cuts were passed.  Apparently, he hasn’t checked the federal income tax rates on individuals and corporations when his parents and his neighbors came here because they were stuck in poverty in countries where the government dominated the economy.  Because, best as I can tell, that comment about immigrants from countries where the government dominated the economy was intended as a warning about Obama’s and the congressional Democrats’ plans to have the government dominate the economy.  </p>
<p>So I’d like some specifics.  What policies and programs, current and proposed, does he have in mind?  Exactly?  Maybe next time he’s interviewed by some high-profile journalist, he’ll be asked that.  And maybe he’ll answer.  But I doubt it.</p>
<p>Anyway, for now, I’m left to speculate that he means raising tax rates to Clinton-era tax levels for people with non-investment incomes above $250,000 a year, and on corporations, and on investment income.  He also might mean Obamacare, but that’s questionable unless he thinks that only people who qualify for Medicare get cancer or other serious illnesses, because he also said this last night:</p>
<div dir="ltr">[Medicare] provided my father the care he needed to battle cancer and ultimately die with dignity.  And it pays for the care my mother receives now.</div>
<p>But the title of this post suggests that Rubio travel more.  Both within this country and outside of it.  First he should visit communities where immigrants from, say, Pakistan and Central America live.  People who came here to escape poverty but whose homeland governments did not, and do not, dominate the economy.*  </p>
<p>Then, if he has a passport, he might consider traveling outside the United States.  Maybe to Canada, or Germany, or Sweden, or Holland, or Australia.  Or France. Or, for that matter, Singapore.  Or Taiwan.  Or he could save the plane fare and just use the Internet to check the rates of poverty in those countries, the tax rates there, the social safety nets there, the education systems there, the healthcare systems there. </p>
<p>I didn’t watch the Rubio Show last night, so I missed the reaching-for-a-water-bottle-but-wishing-it-were-a-Vodka-bottle-instead moment.  I wish I’d watched, but I didn’t.  So I’m relying on tidbits reported by others.  And <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/13/marco-rubio-has-learned-nothing/">Paul Krugman provides one</a> that, unlike the quotes above, have not garnered much attention.  It’s this:</p>
<div dir="ltr">This idea – that our problems were caused by a government that was too small – it’s just not true. In fact, a major cause of our recent downturn was a housing crisis created by reckless government policies.</div>
<p>Krugman points out that numerous studies, as well as observation by, say, ordinary folks, dispel that claim. Specifically, Krugman writes:<br /><a name="more"></a>
<div dir="ltr">OK, leave on one side the caricature of Obama, with the usual mirror-image fallacy (we want smaller government, therefore liberals just want bigger government, never mind what it does); there we go with the “Barney Frank did it” story. Deregulation, the explosive growth of virtually unregulated shadow banking, lax lending standards by loan originators who sold their loans off as soon as they were made, had nothing to do with it — it was all the Community Reinvestment Act, Fannie, and Freddie.</div>
<div dir="ltr">Look, this is one of the most thoroughly researched topics out there, and every piece of the government-did-it thesis has been refuted; see <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/11/01/bloombergs-awful-comment-what-can-we-say-for-certain-regarding-the-gses/">Mike Konczal for a summary.</a> No, the CRA wasn’t responsible for the epidemic of bad lending; no, Fannie and Freddie didn’t cause the housing bubble; no, the “high-risk” loans of the GSEs weren’t remotely as risky as subprime.</div>
<p>So I guess I was wrong when I said above that Rubio must have had only tax rates and Obamacare in mind.  He apparently also had finance-industry regulation in mind, too. And on this he was specific. </p>
<p>But on this too, I suggest some overseas travel&#8211;either physically, or virtually, on the Internet. He&#8217;d learn that Spain, Ireland and Iceland must have had a Fannie Mae and a Freddie Mac. Not to mention a Barney Frank. Because those countries’ current and recent fiscal and economic woes were caused entirely by a housing bubbles virtually identical to, or worse than, ours, spurred by Deregulation, the explosive growth of virtually unregulated shadow banking, lax lending standards by loan originators who sold their loans off as soon as they were made. </p>
<p>Then Rubio might consider returning to Canada and Germany, physically or virtually, and checking out why those countries had little or no such bubble.  And before he leaves, or after he returns, he should travel to Texas.  Yes, Texas, of all states.  It had almost no housing bubble.  Something to do with government involvement in the economy, i.e., legislation regulating the mortgage industry, post-savings-and-loan debacle, circa 1989.  State government, in this case. </p>
<p>What is the national debt of Canada and Germany?  And the poverty levels and standards of living in those countries?  </p>
<p>The Politico article, by the way, is called “Marco Rubio as the anti-Romney.”  The title of Krugman’s post indicates disagreement with that assessment. It’s called “Marco Rubio Has Learned Nothing.”  </p>
<p>But a majority of Americans, I think, have.  They’ve learned that you can’t judge a book by it’s jacket cover. And that ideology can’t substitute for fact. 
<div></div>
<div>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE:  Oh, dear. As I said, I didn’t watch Rubio last night.  I also haven’t read a transcript of his speech.  And I didn’t know until just now, when I read Jazzbumpa’s post below, that Rubio said that proposals to deal with climate change, including trying to slow its progression, are attempts to have the government “control the weather.”</p>
<p>Um.  Yeah.  That’s the idea.  </p>
<p>Yikes.</p></div>
<div>Why do I think Chris Christie is the happiest person in America today?</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE II:  I’m getting the strong feeling that there are a lot of people who are downright dumbfounded by that speech last night&#8211;that this guy who’s being touted as the Republican savior went on national television and established himself as stunningly stupid. </p>
<p>We’re going to elect a global warming denier as president in 2016?  We’re going to elect as president someone who is unaware of such things as financial derivatives, and the role they played in the financial meltdown?  We’re going to elect as president someone who seems not to know that student loans and Medicare are government programs&#8211;or at least what it means that they are?  We’re going to elect as president someone who thinks Clinton-era tax rates are a government-dominated economy?</p>
<p>I’ll certainly agree that he’s no Romney.  Romney isn’t stupid, by any stretch.  He just pretended to be.  With Rubio, it’s apparently no act. </p>
