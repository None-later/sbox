<p>S&#038;P faces civil charges for mortgage bond ratings</p>
<p>The Justice Department&#8217;s efforts to reach a settlement with Standard &#038; Poor&#8217;s Rating Services about the ratings provided to mortgage bonds leading up to the financial crisis have failed, and it appears that civil charges will be filed by the Justice Department and state prosecutors.  See<a href="http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/u-s-and-states-prepare-to-sue-s-p-over-mortgage-ratings/?emc=na%20"> S&#038;P says it expects U.S. civil suit over mortgage bond ratings</a>, New York Times (Feb. 4, 2013).</p>
<p>The suit is expected to be brought in California and focus on about 30 collateralized debt obligation deals (commonly known as &#8220;CDOs&#8221;) executed in 2007 at the height of the mortgage bubble.  The Justice Department has apparently seen &#8220;troves&#8221; of damaging emails among S&#038;P employees.<br />S&#038;P claims the suit is meritless, using hindsight to pinpoint a cause that wasn&#8217;t understood at the time.  McGraw-Hill, S&#038;P&#8217;s parent company, lost 14% of its value after the announcement.</p>

<div dir="ltr">* Don’t forget about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/opinion/krugman-friends-of-fraud.html?hp&#038;_r=0">Paul Krugman</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/opinion/krugman-friends-of-fraud.html?hp&#038;_r=0">has the goods on a story that’s getting far too little attention</a>: In filibustering Richard Cordray, Obama’s choice to head the consumer protection bureau, and demanding major changes to the agency, Republicans are trying to transform it into something that’s essentially unable to carry out its mission.</div>
<div dir="ltr">How can the G.O.P. be so determined to make America safe for financial fraud, with the 2008 crisis still so fresh in our memory? In part it’s because Republicans are deep in denial about what actually happened to our financial system and economy. [&#8230;] Just four years after runaway bankers brought the world economy to its knees, Senate Republicans are using every means at their disposal, violating all the usual norms of politics in the process, in an attempt to give the bankers a chance to do it all over again.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Krugman notes that Cordray has drawn praise even from the bankers, which I’ve seen elsewhere, too. So: Do the financial institutions even favor what the GOP is up to here? </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Worth some more reporting, I’d say.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; Greg Sargent, Washington Post, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/04/the-morning-plum-the-problem-with-the-obama-skeet-shooting-controversy/">today</a></div>
<p>One of the most dismaying and frustrating of Obama’s first-term communication failures was, for me, his utter absence of any real attempt to apprise the public of the existence of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, what its mandate is, and that (and how) the congressional Republicans have concertedly tried to undermine it, via Senate filibuster of any nominee&#8211;not just, first Elizabeth Warren, and then Richard Cordray, but, by their own admission, any nominee&#8211;to head this bureau, and by attempts to fail to appropriate operating funds for it. </p>
<p>Eight days from now, in his State of the Union address, Obama will have a terrific opportunity to educate the public about all this.  All this.  By which I mean: Not just a clause or a sentence near the end of the speech, alluding to it in listing this, that, and the other thing, but instead an actual explanation of it and of the undermining of it by the Repubs. Near the opening of the speech, before viewers click to whatever because they, like me, want to avoid gagging at the extremely tired James Baker’s great-idea-for-staging-at-Reagan’s-State-of-the-Union-addresses-and-used-by-every-president-sinnce-then real-Americans-as-props thing. (Talking about a program to help oil-company workers? Cue two oil-company workers flanking the First Lady, sitting in the first row. You know what I’m talking about.  Ad nauseum.)  </p>
<p>But since the invites of real Americans surely have already been sent out, and there’s no stopping that juggernaut anyway, however more eyes it causes to roll each year, I suggest the addition of some real Americans who already have benefited from the Bureau’s actions.  </p>
<p>I also, by the way, suggest the addition of a real American or two who, because of the provision in Dodd-Frank&#8211;or maybe it was a separate statute, all its own, effective in August 2011 but enacted in 2010 by a Dem-controlled Senate and Dem-controlled House; I’m not sure&#8211;that ended what millions of Americans fondly came to call the $400 Starbucks/McDonalds/Dunkin’Donuts coffee/sandwich/dessert, the result of inadvertent, momentary checking-account overdrafts when the mortgage payment, the doctor’s co-pay, and payment for the brake job the SUV all just by chance happened to post to your checking account moments before you swiped that ATM/credit/debit card at the Starbuck, McDonald’s or Dunkin’ Donuts.  I’ll nominate myself for an invite on that one, even though I’ve never actually owned an SUV and don’t like them much.  </p>
<p>No, <i>that</i> doesn’t involve something that changed the state of the union this past year.  But it’s long past time for our Dem politicians to start pointing out things of exactly this sort, and to ask what exactly the congressional Republicans have done along those lines since Jan. 2011. And to start educating the public about what the specifics of what they’ve done to undermine protections against financial-industry abuse, whether legal or illegal.</p>
<p>Stories that will continue to get far too little attention as long as Obama allows them to.  Or until maybe Prof. Krugman becomes President Krugman&#8211;which sounds like a plan, to me!
<div></div>
<div>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE: Oh, dear.  Turns out that Mitt Romney isn’t the only one who wasn’t familiar with the pre-Aug. 2011 $400 McDonald’s sandwich paid for (many times over) with ATM card payment charges (a.k.a., multiple overdraft fees within a period of 30 seconds.)  Regular reader coberly wasn’t either.  So he and I just exchanged the following comments in the Comments thread:</p>
<p> cobery: 
<div dir="ltr">Beverly</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">You did not exactly take advantage of your own opportunity to explain the Starbucks $400 dessert, but I can guess.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Back when it might have been a problem for me, I kept track of the checks I wrote and did not write them for any more than I had in the bank. I think this prevented even &#8220;inadvertent&#8221; overdrafts.</div>
<p> Me: 
<div dir="ltr">Ah. Actually, I just threw that in there to be funny.  Or to try to be. (It&#8217;s not really a funny subject, so maybe I shouldn&#8217;t have tried.)  But unless you keep a lot of cash in your checking account or tie it automatically to a savings account, or were extremely careful to keep track of your checking account&#8211;and a lot of people have more than one checking account&#8211;you would, before that law came into effect in 2011, have to keep enough money in your account to include an  overdraft fee of $36 (or whatever) each for a single inadvertent overdraft, or you would find yourself charged repeated overdraft fees in a single day for every charge that came in until you realized you were overdrawn.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The new law applies only to debit/credit card/ATM transactions, not to actual checks, so you still have to be careful about checks, especially since you can&#8217;t be sure when they&#8217;ll be cashed. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">It also helps if you can add and subtract, I’ve learned the hard way.  One of my tax-law profs. used to say that his wife was always the one to actually do their income tax returns. The guy was friggin’ brilliant in discussing legal theory and tax strategy&#8211;best as I could tell, anyway&#8211;but swore that he couldn’t do actual math, or even competently use a calculator, worth a damn.  Makes me feel better when I recall that. (Calculators sorta throw me off, too, since I can’t figure out what all those funny-looking math symbols are.  Like the + and &#8211; signs.)</div>
<p>Back in the pre-Dodd-Frank days, there were looooads of stories on the web and elsewhere about this kind of thing.  So I assumed everyone was familiar with the issue.  Not so, though. So I thought I’d add this explanation. </div>

<p>
<blockquote><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2013/01/joe-scarborough-on-deficit.html">Joe Scarborough on the Deficit</a></p>
<p>After his interview with Paul Krugman this morning <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/paul-krugman-vs-the-world-86822.html?hp=l9">Joe Scarborough</a> wrote:</p>
<p>Mr. Krugman&#8217;s view is that Americans would be better off if its government ran deeper deficits and ignored its longterm debt.<br />To suggest that Keynesians like Paul Krugman ignore the long-term government budget constraint is either dishonest or shows that Mr. Scarborough does not understand what we are saying. Which is why Mr. Scarborough should check out <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/10-people-who-disagree-with-joe-scarborough-2013-1">this list</a> of commentary on the current economics and fiscal situation compiled by Joe Weisenthal.  </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>PROPOSED PANEL 3: 2013 KAUFFMAN FOUNDATION ECONOMIC WEBLOGGERS&#8217; CONFERENCE: FRIDAY APRIL 12, 2013</p>
<p>11:45 AM: <strong>Economic and Weblogging and the Future and Sustainability of Financial Journalism:</strong> Panel: Cardiff Garcia, Joe Weisenthal, Allison Schrager):</p>
<p>DRAFT INTRO: As Michael Bloomberg will readily attest, people are willing to pay a lot for timely and accurate information about financial markets. But issues quickly become more technical and convoluted than even in the rest of weblogging about the economy. And the problem of monetization remains: if one is unable to bundle one’s weblogging with delivery of a proprietary asset price-reporting terminal persuading somebody to actually pay so that you can continue to provide them with high-quality financial information that they find of immense value turns out to be a hard problem. Here today we have three panelists: one provides pink pages and web content behind a nasty firewall, one provides information firewall-free, and one is both a consumer and producer of what modern financial weblogging creates. We welcome Cardiff Garcia, Joe Weisenthal, Allison Schrager.</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of monetization is an interesting one, and important, and is worth exploring.  </p>

<p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/02/how-to-debae-paul-krugman.html">Ron T. aka Jazzbumpa</a> received an unusual thank you from Paul Krugman for this post on a Mish Shedlock post about debating PK.</p>
<p>Krugman recommended <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/short-takes-2" target="_blank">Beverly Mann</a>  on January 15th this year as part of a  recommended reading post.  </p>
<p>Other <i>Angry Bear</i> contributors gaining mention and recommendation by name in the recent past that immediately come to mind are <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/04/what-is-question-responding-to-paul.html" target="_blank">Mike Kimel</a> and <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/early-social-security-projections/" target="_blank">Bruce Webb</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Funny: <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/02/how-to-debae-paul-krugman.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FHzoh+%28Angry+Bear%29">Angry Bear</a> finds some of the usual suspects explaining <a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2013/01/how-to-debate-paul-krugman-ask.html">How to Debate Paul Krugman</a>, and the answer appears to be this: invent a straw man who bears no resemblance at all to the economist/columnist of the same name, and ridicule that imaginary person. I have to say, never in my wildest dreams did I imagine that I could play the role of History’s Greatest Monster to so many people. Thank you for the honor!</p>
<p>Aside from the silliness of the exercise, this little exchange is another illustration of a point I’ve noticed before: the way hard-right commentators assume that the other side must be <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/12/i-am-not-your-mirror-image/">their mirror image</a>. They insist that no government intervention is ever justified; so liberals must support any and all government interventions. They want smaller government, as a principle; liberals must want bigger government, never mind what for. They believe that deficits and printing money are always evil; liberals must be for deficits and money-printing under all circumstances.</p>
<p>An hour spent browsing this blog would quickly refute all of this, together with the bizarre charge that I never look at evidence; you may not agree with my conclusions, but I sure do post a lot of numbers. But obviously looking at what I actually write would just be too painful.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks guys, you made my day.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I&#8217;d like to share and discuss a FRED graph.  To me it shows an alarming similarity between inflation expected over the next five years and inflation over the past year.  The title is not uh very useful.</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sWlNPWfzNM4/UQ7y5hf54AI/AAAAAAAAAjs/xlrqpZQV2B8/s1600/westex3.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sWlNPWfzNM4/UQ7y5hf54AI/AAAAAAAAAjs/xlrqpZQV2B8/s640/westex3.JPG" height="380" width="600"></a></div>
<p>The red line is the nominal treasuries minus TIPS breakeven for constant maturity of 5 years &#8212; the difference between the nominal interest rate and the real rate paid by Treasury Inflation Protected Securities.  The 5 year constant maturity TIPS rate is calculated by interpolation, because there are only a few TIPS  with a few different maturities on the market. The breakeven should be related to expected inflation, but should be lower than expected inflation as the price of regular nominal Treasuries includes a liquidity premium (which was huge during the panic of 2008).  The yellow line is the rate of growth over the precedeing year of the geometric mean of the personal consumption deflator and the personal consumption deflator excluding food and energy (AKA core inflation). The blue line is the rate of growth of the price of crude oil in West Texas times 0.03 to fit it on the same graph.</p>
<p>To me the most striking feature of the graph is that back in the good old days before the recession, the looking forward 5 years breakeven is almost identical to the past years geometric mean of inflation and core inflation.  This shouldn&#8217;t have happened.  It corresponds to extremely mechanical adaptive expectations.  The correlation is just too strong to be a coincidence.  Since the trough the comovement remains impressive but is no longer shocking. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The oil price impressively times the increase in breakeven inflation at the time QE II started.  The magnitude is a bit low (earlier the movement of the breakeven is less than 0.03 times the movement of the log price of oil and  in late 2010 and early 2011 they are almost identical).</p>
<p>My takeaway from the graph is that foreward looking expectated inflation is extremely similar to past inflation leaving almost no room for the rational expectations based critique of the use of adaptive expectations or any effects from quantitative easing (since QE 1) or forward guidance. </p>
<p>There are two problems.  First, my takeaway from the empirical exercise  is exactly the same as my bring to the exercise which makes even me suspicious.  Also the exercise is neither here nor there &#8212; it isn&#8217;t a simple obvious FRED graph as the variables are somewhat processed and it certainly isn&#8217;t econometrics with confidence intervals and hypotheses tested.  Still I think the graph should impress and shock.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>We saw it on the “fiscal cliff”: enough House Republicans voted for the deal, along with most Democrats, to get something passed.</p>
<p>Republicans backed down on the debt ceiling.</p>
<p>On immigration, we’re also seeing the two parties working together to craft a solution.</p>
<p>This feels like a possible sea change.</p>
<p>Should Obama get credit? He’s stuck to a vision, a “hope,” for bipartisan cooperation over the last four years, an approach that many or most liberals considered pie-in-the-sky, weak-principled, downright lacking in cojones.</p>
<p>So here’s my question about an imagined counterfactual: if Obama had played hard(er)ball over the last four years, steamrolled Republicans and taken hard negotiation lines in ways that liberals have been clamoring for and that might even have worked (hard to say), where would we be at today?</p>
<p>Here’s a clue, showing the state of the game: the NYT just <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/us/politics/a-secret-bipartisan-group-with-its-own-immigration-plan.html?_r=0">revealed</a> that Republican and Democrats in the House and Senate have been meeting secretly to work on the immigration issue <em>for four years</em>.</p>
<p>Why secretly? Not far to guess: because any Republican who appeared to be working with Democrats on that conservative third rail would open his right flank to a primary challenge from Tea Partiers. (Democrats would most likely get an electoral <em>boost</em>, in both the primaries and the generals, from such cooperation on immigration.)</p>
<p>So some Republicans wanted to participate (props to ‘em), but needed to keep it secret for purely political reasons. Democrats also wanted to participate, but they were willing to sacrifice political advantage to do so — that was the only way they could do what they thought was a Good Thing, perhaps with some uncertain long-term political benefits, but because of the Republican-required secrecy, absolutely nothing short-term.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the rump of Republicans that retains any faint pretense of being “moderate” is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/us/politics/top-gop-donors-seek-greater-say-in-senate-races.html?hp">fighting back against their (our) Tea-Party oppressors</a>, hoping to regain some strength in general elections.</p>
<p>One more example of the asymmetry in political incentives: We all saw the political price Boehner paid for simply negotiating (again: necessarily semi-secretly) with Obama. I would venture to suggest that those negotiations didn’t cost Obama a single vote, or really any political capital  – certainly nothing like what they cost Boehner.</p>
<p>So back to the question: would this dynamic have played out differently if Obama had played hardball instead of kissy-face? Two questions there:</p>
<p>1. Would we have gotten more progressive legislation over the last four years?</p>
<p>Almost certainly some. But given that Republicans have lots of power, especially veto power (far exceeding their popular support*), quite possibly not all that much.</p>
<p>2. Would we have achieved more or less of the political ascendancy that is now <em>forcing</em> Republicans to demonstrate some semblance of reasonableness?</p>
<p>With its emphasis on force, I have to admit that I’ve set that question up to half-answer itself. The only reason Republicans are cooperating is because politics and popular opinion are forcing them to. It’s not because they’ve seen some light, or because Obama was nice to them or caved in negotiations. To put it another way, general-election losses are forcing (allowing?) them to get sane(r) in the primaries, hence in the legislative chamber. Obama’s giveaways had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>The other half comes down to this: if Obama had played tougher, would he and other Democrats have won <em>bigger</em> in November, putting even more pressure on Republicans to cooperate? I tend to think so, but it’s a counterfactual that I don’t think we can ever answer with even a little bit of confidence.</p>
<p>So the answer to this post’s question is, Maybe.</p>
<p>* That inordinate power is the result of three things:</p>
<p>1. House electoral advantage based on incumbency and state-level Republican <a href="http://election.princeton.edu/2013/02/03/slaying-the-gerrymander/">gerrymandering</a> over the last decade+. Democrats needed about 54% of the popular house vote to take a House majority in 2012.</p>
<p>2. Their willingness (incentives?) to use the filibuster unremittingly for effective veto power, with overwhelmingly more “cloture votes” than by any Senate minority in history.</p>
<p>3. The “Hastert Rule” that they all adhered to in the House, preventing any vote on a bill absent support from half the Republicans. (They finally <a href="http://politicalwire.com/archives/2013/01/18/gop_lawmaker_admits_hastert_rule_is_dead.html">broke with this rule</a> on the fiscal cliff, and it looks like that break may continue.)</p>

<p>Red state tax &#8220;reform&#8221; and &#8220;economic growth&#8221;</p>
<p>As most tax practitioners and academics know, Professor Paul Caron maintains a &#8220;tax prof blog&#8221; that provides timely links to most things tax in major papers, blogs, journals, conferences and the like, as well as announcements and releases from the<a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">IRS</a>, Treasury and Congress related to tax.  Paul does not usually provide much analysis or opinion, but rather an excerpt or two and a title.</p>
<p>So a recent blog post was titled  &#8220;<a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2013/01/states-turn-.html">WSJ: States Embrace Tax Reform to Drive Economic Growth</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>This is not an atypical way of titling items on tax prof blog.  The observant reader will notice a slight bias in the title.  The Wall Street Journal article is actually titled &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323968304578245720280333676.html?mod=djemEditorialPage_h">The State Tax Reformers: more governors look to repeal their income taxes</a>&#8221; (Jan 29 2013 updated).  The article summarizes states that are lowering or eliminating their income tax (sometimes including their corporate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">income taxes</a>) and sometimes replacing it with a broad sales tax&#8211;for example, in the Republican strongholds of Nebraska and Louisiana.  The Journal article then goes on to opine (and it is indeed opinion) that &#8220;this swap makes sense&#8221; because &#8220;income taxes generally do more economic harm because they are a direct penalty on saving, investment and labor that create new wealth&#8221; whereas &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax">sales taxes</a> &#8230; hit consumption, which is the result of that wealth creation.&#8221;  This is the typical &#8220;free market&#8221; pitch favoring capital income (and the rich) over labor income (and everybody else). </p>
<p>Of course, the Journal then proceeds to quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Laffer">Art Laffer</a> for the right-wing corporatist ALEC in an article claiming that a majority of new jobs are created in states without an <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">income tax</a> because of their lack of an income tax.<br />[Aside:  Laffer is (in)famous as the &#8216;free market&#8217; economist who described his view of the maximum tax rate by drawing a bell curve on a napkin.  The Laffer Curve is more ideology than theory, as I explain in an earlier post:  <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2008/02/cfps-laffer-cur.html">CFP&#8217;s Laffer Curve Video</a>, ataxingmatter (Feb. 2008). ]</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Caron&#8217;s title suggests that the &#8220;real&#8221; policy reason for the shift is a &#8220;real&#8221; desire to create jobs. </p>
<p>I have significant doubts.  Most of the anti-income tax proponents are pro-Big Business and pro-wealth.  A shift from an income tax to a consumption/sales tax is a move from a somewhat (often minimally) progressive tax system to an explicitly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regressive_tax">regressive tax</a> system.  Such a move favors those with capital assets and mainly capital income.  Claims (like that made by the Civitas Institute cited in the Journal article) that shifting from income tax to sales tax will result in &#8220;average annual personal income growth&#8221; mean almost nothing since averaging income growth across a population doesn&#8217;t really tell you whether almost all of it goes to the wealthy or not&#8211;if that growth goes to those already in the wealthy distribution, then inequality increases and in fact most everybody else is worse off, in spite of the &#8220;average&#8221; growth.</p>
<p>The Journal acknowledges the regressive nature of a sales tax swap, but suggests that exemptions of necessities (e.g., food, medicine, utilities) and rebates for low-income families will suffice.  I also find that doubtful&#8211;the very low absolute benefit to the poor of the exemptions and/or rebates, while important, is substantially less than the very real high absolute benefit to the wealthy of the switch to a consumption rather than income tax.  Accordingly, the so-called &#8220;reform&#8221; will inevitably increase an already devastingly problematic inequality that has resulted in lower quality of life for most Americans on many different areas from literacy to access to <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">health care</a> to teenage pregnancy to death rates and all the many other factors in which Americans enjoy a lower level of quality of life than most other OECD nations. </p>
<p>Not, in other words, a good idea.  As noted in Nick Carnes (who teaches at Duke University), <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/01/24/2630904/a-tax-reform-plan-that-rewards.html">A Tax-Reform Plan that Rewards the Wealthy and Stalls the State</a>, NewsObserver.com (Jan 24, 2013, modified Jan. 25, 2013), these proposals are being pushed by right-wing propaganda tanks, including a &#8220;<i>wealthy conservative foundation [that] has paid [Arthur] Laffer to write another report and to fly to our state to  promote it.</i>&#8221;  Id. </p>
<p>The goups behind these proposals have their one-size-fits-all state-level strategy down to a science, but they don’t have a handle on the actual science of state tax reform. It’s easy to see why their ideas are appealing. Who wouldn’t like to grow our economy and lower taxes without cutting vital services like schools and public safety?</p>
<p>However, independent economists in every state where the Laffer plan has been introduced – including North Carolina – have found serious problems with the evidence its proponents have used to back it up. No matter how low the tax rate is, businesses and wealthy people won’t relocate to a state where the schools are bad, the streets are unsafe and the infrastructure is crumbling – things that all tend to happen when taxes are cut to the levels that the Laffer plan outlines.  Id.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Carnes article goes on to note that &#8220;Kansas, which earlier passed the Laffer bill, is now projecting $800 million annual budget deficits and has extended an emergency sales tax that should have expired years ago&#8221; while state agencies are facing a 10% across the board cut, with education expected to lose a billion dollars in state funding over the next five years.  Yet no businesses have flocked to Kansas because of the legislation.  Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>And guess what.  It is the wealthy who would benefit if North Carolina were to carry through with enacting its own form of the &#8220;Laffer bill&#8221;.  Carnes notes that families earning $24,000 a year would pay $500 MORE in taxes under the Laffer plan, whereas wealthy families with incomes of more than $900,000 a year would pay $42,000 LESS in taxes.  Id. Shifting the tax burden from the wealthy who can easily bear it to the low-income who cannot, while at the same time cutting government support for essential public services that build a shared community is a disaster in the making.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal isn&#8217;t flummoxed by such facts (which it doesn&#8217;t even acknowledge).  The Journal article suggests that the idea (set forth in some Big Oil/Fracking states) of replacing income taxes with revenues from oil and gas extraction would be good (and maybe better than regressive sales taxes) because &#8220;it would make everyone a stakeholder&#8221; in increased drilling and fracking, thus &#8220;help[ing] to build a politicial constituency for more mining and drilling.&#8221;  Note the presupposition that supporting &#8220;more mining and more drilling&#8221; is inherently a public good! (One assumes that the Journal staff think this because Big Oil/Big Gas is Big Business, and the Journal is ALWAYS in favor of whatever Big Business wants.) </p>
<p>That idea strikes me as truly worrisome&#8211;we have a climate-change problem, and trying to &#8220;buy&#8221; votes to support environmental degradation at whatever cost through the swap of income taxes for some (probably minimal) increased royalties (probably also accompanied by less in the way of services, especially for the poor or for public goods like public education) is not a good idea.  Yes, probably those very people who are the poorest and most harmed by environmental degradation would tend to be able to be bought off by that swap&#8211;they would not realize that the wealthy are again getting the mountain of the share of the benefit, and they are bearing most of the burden in terms of the long-term costs of the environmental degradation as well as the long-term costs of lower public revenues spent on programs especially important to them because of their lack of a cushion of wealth (schools, public parks, fire/police, health care, etc.).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Journal article notes that Alaska got rid of its income tax in the 1980s and suggests that&#8217;s been a good deal.  Of course, Alaska also gets more back from the Federal government than it gives in Federal taxes&#8211;ie, Alaskans have replaced their income tax revenues with federal handouts.</p>
<p>The Journal calls these plans for revamping state laws to provide substantial benefits to wealthy individuals and corporations a &#8220;rare bright spot in the current high-tax era.&#8221;  That is garbage from both sides.  We do not live in a &#8220;high-tax era.&#8221;  IN fact, we live in a low-tax era and we are already paying for that with the significant drop in state support for higher education, state support for parks and other public amenities (police and fire protection, protections for workers, fair and easy access to voting, etc.), and state support for K-12 education as well as the failure of the federal government to fund the kinds of infrastructure and education and basic research projects that could make the difference between a continuing great economy and the continuing muddle we are in after the Bush recession. </p>
<p>All of those costs are borne more substantially by those in the lower-income brackets.  With the proposed &#8220;reforms&#8221;, the wealthy will be sailing through with even more wealth, able to shut out even more effectively any association with the &#8220;lower class&#8221; elements and giving even less to support schools, colleges, unemployment benefits, etc.  Meanwhile, the poor and near-poor will get much, much less (when they didn&#8217;t owe much in taxes anyway).  Not a bright spot at all.  More like class warfare.</p>
<p>The real reason behind these shifts is to benefit the major members of the Republican base&#8211;i.e., Big Business and the wealthy.  It has little to do with jobs&#8230;  That&#8217;s just a handy obfuscating claim to make about policy moves that substantially shift the benefits of the economic system to the rich and the burdens of the economic system to everyone else.  This is just another element of the class warfare that has been waged for the last few decades to allocate gains to the wealthy.</p>
