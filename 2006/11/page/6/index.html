                                                                    </div>

                                <p>As we were voting yesterday, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWFkMmQxMWQzYzE5ZGQyNjFhYjI4YmEzZTJiZDQ4Yzc=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> was writing:<br />
<blockquote>A series of late-October, early November surprises has turned the midterm elections into a real horse race. The bullish stock markets of recent months have been saying all along that a Democratic tsunami will not materialize, but now even a decent Dem wave seems a long shot.</p></blockquote>
<p>But as we argued <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/cheney-tells-kudlow-he-doesnt-trust.html">here</a>, the stock market is influenced by factors other than which party will win an election.   <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/election_2006_/2006/11/money_talks_bullsht_walks.php">Mark Kleiman</a> was reporting on the Iowa Electronic Market yesterday:<br />
<blockquote>As of this writing, Republican loss of control of the House is 82 bid, 84 offered. That&#8217;s been trending up over the past week: the average daily prices since Wednesday have been 73, 73, 79,79, 80.</p></blockquote>
<p>But even as the Iowa Electronic Market was predicting that Nancy Pelosi would become Speaker of the House, the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=%5EGSPC&#038;t=5d">S&#038;P 500</a> was doing quite well since the opening of business Monday morning.  Of course, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3683270">the press</a> has this spin:<br />
<blockquote>The broad advance came as investors bought optimistically ahead of an election that could strip power from Republicans in the House of Representatives for the first time since 1994. Stocks often rally on elections as Wall Street bets change will lead to an environment more favorable to business; the theory on the Street is that a split in power in Washington will create legislative gridlock, slowing down regulatory change.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stock markets up – sign of a GOP upset?  Oh wait, the Democrats regained control of the House, never mind.  Then again, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTk3MDJlNWMzZmNmNDczM2Y4NjgyNmZhYjYyYThkNDM=">Kudlow</a> comes back with:<br />
<blockquote>Look at blue dog conservative Dem victories, and look at Northeast liberal GOP defeats. The changeover in the House may well be a conservative victory, not a liberal one. Blue dogs are rabid budget balancers. At tomorrow&#8217;s news conference, President Bush should reach out to them, and to Republican base, with a spending limitation pay-as-you go proposal that gets to a balanced budget in a couple of years. Any spending increases (defense) must be offset with spending cuts (domestic pork). A spending limit paygo was used effectively by the Gingrich Congresses between 1995 and 1998, the high tide of their limited government period. And, this approach will head off a revenue paygo advocated by Pelosi, Spratt and Rangel that would lead to tax hikes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good grief &#8211; I thought Kudlow was against paygo.  I guess if one is allowed to flip-flop like this from one day to the next &#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/002995.html">Dan Drezner</a> channels <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20061108/bs_afp/usvotemarketsstocksforexeuropeworld_061108113120">this tale</a> as the Pelosi effect:<br />
<blockquote>Global finance markets have wobbled on fears that a Democrat victory in the US Congressional elections could prompt less market-friendly policies in the world&#8217;s biggest economy.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/010176.php">Kevin Drum</a> objects and Dan replies:<br />
<blockquote>He might be right &#8211; but that conventional wisdom seems pretty widespread in the business press</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny – the S&#038;P 500 was up 0.21% today!</p>

                                <p>To some extent, a rising dollar reflects rising confidence in the US relative to other countries, whereas a falling dollar reflects shrinking confidence in the US relative to other countries.</p>
<p>The table below shows the geometric mean of the yearly percentage growth rates in the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/Summary/indexbc_m.txt"> price adjusted broad dollar index </a> compiled by the Federal Reserve.  </p>
<p>Ford____-4.49%<br />Carter___-0.97%<br />Reagan___0.75%<br />GHW____-3.21%<br />Clinton___1.94%<br />GW_____-0.38%</p>
<p>(Yearly changes are for February to February, as the President’s inauguration takes place toward the end of January.)</p>
<p>Note… data only goes back to 1973 since before that the Bretton Woods system was in effect.  </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the only two presidents since 1973 that still seem to be popular were also the only two under whom the dollar’s value actually rose.</p>

<blockquote>Chris LaCivita, a senior consultant to the Allen campaign, said the calls weren’t originating from the GOP. “And it’s sure as heck not coming from the Allen campaign,” LaCivita said. “I doubt the validity of them, quite frankly.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess we will see if these calls did or did not come from GOP operatives.  But it sure sounds like a senior consultant to Senator Allen has accused some citizens of Virginia of lying.</p>

Bush’s rubber stamp.As a follow-up to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/republicans-have-already-raised-your.html">The Republicans Have Already Raised Your Taxes</a>, I want to go back to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/did-stephen-moore-sucker-kevin-drum.html">this post</a> with a hat tip to an old post from <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2005_06/006496.php">Kevin Drum</a>.  As I noted:<br />
<blockquote>Note in particular that Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts increased by over 140% from 1980 to 1990 so all other taxes increased by only 81% in nominal terms. In real terms, tax revenues not including Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts rose by less than 18% even before adjusting for population increases. With a 10% increase in population, real tax revenues per capita excluding Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts rose by a mere 7% over the decade. Of course, one might ask with Social Insurance and Retirement Receipts rose by over 140% in nominal terms. One reason had to do with the payroll tax increase to pre-fund the Social Security benefits of the baby boom generation … My problem is that Moore has known all of this for a long time as others repeatedly point out the folly of his Oct. 2000 op-ed with Laffer. Yet, he continues to make the same claim repeatedly. Stupidity? I think not. Mendacity? It seems so.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right – on the eve of the Bush v. Gore election in 2000, Art Laffer and Stephen Moore lied to us.  OK, that’s not unusual for these two.  But let’s review the history of Federal revenue collections over the past 30 years (about the time some of us 50 plus somethings were in graduate school or entering the workforce).  Under Jimmy Carter, we paid less than 6% of GDP in the form of payroll taxes with other forms of Federal taxes running between 13% and 14% of GDP.  While the Federal debt to GDP ratio declined to less than 33% of GDP by the time Carter left office, we were not setting aside Social Security Trust Fund reserves so as to fund (or pre-fund) the retirement benefits of the baby boom generation.</p>
<p>So OK, we are now paying 7% of GDP in the form of payroll taxes so as to pre-fund the retirement benefits of the baby boom generation.  Thank you St. Ronald Reagan for the 1983 Social Security reforms!  Of course, you might have noticed that other forms of Federal taxes fell as a percent of GDP.  And even though they will tell you otherwise, Art Laffer and Stephen Moore know all too well that there was no supply-side miracle during the 1980’s.  </p>
<p>During the 1990’s, we saw tax rate increases to pay off the Reagan General Fund fiasco.  Of course, Art Laffer and Stephen Moore predicted slow economic growth during the 1990’s.  As usual, they were wrong.  But then comes George W. Bush with his desire to “give us our money” back even as he increases government spending.  Did that lead to a supply-side miracle?  Of course not.  But once again, the total Federal debt is rising relative to GDP.  </p>
<p>A few of our friends on the <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/10/what_is_the_rig.html">right</a> might prefer to report the unified deficit and the ratio of debt held by the public to GDP, which makes the picture look not quite so bad.  But then aren’t they saying that St. Reagan’s 1983 promise has been destroyed?  In other words, what we thought a generation ago were contributions to our Social Security retirement benefits were just increases in employment taxes so folks like President Reagan and George W. Bush can give tax breaks for the well to do.  If so – couldn’t we have at least one Republican who would have the integrity to just say so.</p>
<p>Which brings me back to <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/010065.php">Kevin Drum</a> who blasted <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/06/AR2006110601121.html">Michael Kinsley</a> for this:<br />
<blockquote>Honesty is not just therapeutic. Fiscal honesty is a practical necessity. &#8220;New Direction&#8221; quite rightly denounces the staggering fiscal irresponsibility of Republican leaders and duly promises &#8220;Pay As You Go&#8221; spending. But in the entire document there is not one explicit revenue-raiser to balance the many specific and enormous new spending programs and tax credits.</p></blockquote>
<p>In principle, Kinsley is right.  But I’m with Kevin on this one as it is high time we hold the GOP to the standards of fiscal honesty as well.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YmY5MTI2MDA1OWRhYzljYjM2ZWEzNmE4Njg5ZWNhMWQ=">Kate O&#8217;Beirne</a> reports on a survey of likely voters:<br />
<blockquote>A survey of 1200 likely voters taken in 12 swing districts this past Sunday and Monday might explain why Republicans might have a long night ahead of them. The veteran GOP pollster says he has &#8220;never seen anything like it.&#8221;  Asked who is more likely to cut taxes for the middle class &#8211; 42 percent said Democrats, 29 picked Republicans.  Who is more likely to reduce the deficit?  47 &#8211; Democrats, 22 &#8211; Repubicans.  And, who is more likely to control spending? Democrats &#8211; 38, Republicans &#8211; 21.  In the past, even if Repubicans didn&#8217;t win some race or another, they were more trusted on taxes and spending issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>What do I draw from this?  That these likely voters have stopped reading the garbage in that rag Kate writes for – and actually have starting thinking logically about these issues.  Why should any rational people trust the free lunch crowd in the GOP?</p>

<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=2627805">Ed O’Keefe</a> covers the interview between George Stephanopoulos and dishonest Dick “deficits don’t matter” Cheney:<br />
<blockquote>Cheney said that even with pollsters predicting that Democrats would likely make gains in both houses of Congress Tuesday, voter sentiment would not influence Bush&#8217;s Iraq policy. &#8220;It may not be popular with the public &#8211; it doesn&#8217;t matter in the sense that we have to continue the mission and do what we think is right. And that&#8217;s exactly what we&#8217;re doing,&#8221; Cheney said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not running for office. We&#8217;re doing what we think is right.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Why would the Vice President tell voters to f*** you as to Iraq?  I think the real message was clear when Cheney accused Charles Rangel of wanting to raise your taxes.  Bill Frist said the same thing on Face the Nation and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/04/bush/index.html">President Bush</a> decided to a television version of his Saturday radio address to say the same thing:  <br />
<blockquote>President Bush devoted his last national radio address before critical elections to the economy, telling voters that a Democrat Congress would hit their pocketbooks.&#8221;  Democrats are still determined to raise taxes,&#8221; Bush said from a coffee shop in Englewood, Colorado, in an unusual televised version of his weekly speech.  He predicted Democrats would block renewal of expiring tax legislation if they regained control of Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the GOP wants to change the subject and tell you that only they will keep your taxes low permanently.  But as long as you accept the Milton Friedman realism that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/11/to_spend_is_to_.html">To Spend is to Tax</a>, one knows that someone will pay more in taxes in the future as the GOP has no clue where to reduce spending.  If you don’t believe Dr. Friedman, let me suggest you listen to <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002655.html">Max Sawicky’s dog</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s review a couple of time series.  The first is the total Federal debt to GDP ratio from 1980 through what is projected for 2007.  Notice three things.  Debt rose relative to GDP after the Reagan tax “cuts” as the GOP never got around to reducing Federal spending.  Under Bill Clinton, we temporarily reversed this increase through a combination of tax increases and reductions in defense spending.  But George W. Bush changed all of that and the debt to GDP ratio is rising again.  Simply put – we have deferred taxation but not reduced it. </p>
<p>After Cheney’s babbling about the “T” word, George Stephanopoulos interviewed Howard Dean who raised the “D” word – those massive General Fund deficits.  Dean accused Bush and Cheney of “cooking the books” – something the former CEO of <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/08/04/national/main633850.shtml">Halliburton</a> is quite familiar with.</p>
<p>Our second graph gives you some idea of what Mr. Dean is talking about.  Federal taxes excluding payroll contributions as a share of GDP are only 11%.  Federal spending excluding Social Security benefits and interest payments are running around 14% of GDP.  So the General Fund has an operating loss near 3% of GDP and on top of that, interest payments on the Federal debt are running another 3% of GDP.  The GOP’s only idea as to how to reduce this shortfall is to cut the pork and waste that they have brought to Washington, D.C. over the past six years.  Even if they did, it’s pennies on the dollar.  Our graphs don’t include the massive and unfunded cost of the prescription drug benefit that the GOP is now bragging about.  And when Democrats suggest ways to trim the cuts of this unfunded program, the GOP objects as it might hurt Big Pharma.  See the latest from <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/11/reforming_the_medicare_drug_pl.html#014333">Dean Baker</a> for more on the excuses from the GOP and Big Pharma.</p>
<p>So where will the spending cuts come from? I have argued many times that the real Bush-Cheney plan is a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/bushs-backdoor-employment-tax-increase.html">backdoor employment tax increase</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Bush’s Social Security proposal cuts the benefits of young workers drastically but does not reduce the payroll tax rate. In other words, it is a backdoor tax increase on young workers. The Bush fiscal agenda does appear to be tax cuts for rich older people paid for by deferred employment tax increases on young workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>So here’s the real deal.  Someone will face a future tax increase.  To paraphrase Walter Mondale’s courageous statement to the 1984 Democratic National Convention – Dick Cheney “will raise your taxes; so will I. He won&#8217;t tell you; I just did”.  The Republican’s secret plan is to impose massive tax increases on workers.  Congressman Rangel would rather have some of the future tax increase placed on high income individuals.  There in is the real choice facing voters.  So get out and vote tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I was wondering who at the National Review would be asked to spin that canard that Charlie Rangel wanted to raise your taxes – and the duty seems to have gone to <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YmI1YTI4NTA0NzM0ZmFlYzU4YTZkMjc1NGNhMTU5Mjc=">Deroy Murdock</a>: <br />
<blockquote>If Democrats take Congress tomorrow, hide your wallet. Tax hikes and spending increases are right around the corner.</p></blockquote>
<p>While he leads with the claim that the Democrats want even more spending than we have seen under the GOP led Federal government, Murdock provides not a single example of where they would propose more spending and not a single example where George W. Bush wants to cut spending if only the Democrats would let him beyond some weird tally from the National Taxpayers Union regarding proposals made in the Senate.  Maybe Murdock is confused as to which chamber Charlie Rangel and Nancy Pelosi serve in.  Murdock does admit the following:<br />
<blockquote>Alas, the GOP largely has abandoned fiscal discipline to spend riotously on national programs and parochial boondoggles.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Murdock outsourced the hit job on Senator Kerry as allegedly a big spending to <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTZhOTg1MmI1ZDYzYWJlNTQwMzM0ZWM4ZjQ4NTJkNTI=">Jerry Bowyer</a> who took the following quote to suggest that John Kerry is another Hugo Chavez:<br />
<blockquote>I can’t find anything in any religion anywhere, I certainly cannot find anything in the three-year ministry of Jesus Christ, that says you ought to take health care away from poor children or money away from the poorest people in the country to give it to the wealthiest people in the nation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bowyer then goes onto lecture us as to What Would Jesus Do, which seems to be to give the wealthy a tax cut according to the Biblical scholar named Jerry Bowyer.  But what is really incredible is that Mr. Bowyer seems to think that George W. Bush has reduced the amount that the Federal government is spending on health care.  I guess he is incapable of comprehending the possibility that we can could have a more efficient health care system as he is unaware that the GOP is opposing Democratic proposals to lower the cost of that prescription drug benefit.</p>

                                <p>I had a previous post, or rather, a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/rant-about-attorneys.html"> rant</a> about the legal system.  In it, I pointed out a big difference between the jury system and, say, consulting, namely that though both are called in to make decisions about what is going on, the jury is legally required to be far less informed about what is going on about the facts than anyone else in the courtroom.  On the other hand, a consultant that kept him or herself ignorant before reaching a conclusion soon go out of business.</p>
<p>I just thought of another very big difference between the legally system and other professions…  in some ways, demand for attorneys (at any price) is driven up by the presence of more attorneys.  In a town with no attorneys, if nobody needs an attorney, then, well, nobody needs an attorney.  But if one person has an attorney and uses the attorney (say, for a lawsuit), then automatically, at least one other person, if not many others, also need an attorney, whether they wanted one or not. </p>
<p>Contrast that with other professions:  if you hire one construction worker, one doctor, one cab driver, one whatever – you aren’t imposing a need on anyone else to do the same.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/11/believe_the_establishment_surv.html#014326">Dean Baker</a> and the Wall Street Journal note that the reported growth in employment per the Household Survey (HS) was much higher than the reported growth per the Payroll Survey for the month of October.  Given the tendency for HS growth to be quite volatile, I was wondering whether this one month difference disappears if we look at a longer period of time.  My graph shows month by month growth for the past year – and it does turn that the HS shows a lot of volatility.  However, the growth over the past year per PS was only 1,967,000 as compared to 2,662,000 per HS – for a difference near 700 thousand. </p>
<p>Dean writes:<br />
<blockquote>I looked at the data more closely and must come down on the side of the establishment survey. The simple arithmetic looks like this. Social Security tax collections were up 5.35 percent in fiscal year 06 compared to fiscal year 05. The average weekly wage rose by 3.9 percent, which implies job growth of 1.4 percent. Reported job growth in the establishment survey matches this closely, at 1.44 percent. However, we know that the Labor Department will add in 810,000 jobs to its March 2006 number in its benchmarked revision (these additional jobs are wedged in over the prior 12 months). When the data is adjusted for these additional jobs, the establishment survey shows job growth of 1.9 percent for the fiscal year, substantially more rapid growth than is implied by the growth in Social Security tax receipts. There are complicating factors here &#8211; self-employed workers pay SS taxes, but are not counted in the establishment data, many government workers don&#8217;t pay into SS &#8211; but these are not likely to change the basic story. It is implausible that the establishment survey is understating job growth, and it may well be overstating it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/11/republicans_insist_that_produc.html">Dean</a> also makes this point:<br />
<blockquote>If job growth is actually more rapid than is being reported by the establishment survey, then productivity growth is lower than BLS is now reporting. BLS uses the establishment survey for hours data when it calculates productivity growth. If the establishment survey has understated job growth, then BLS is understating hours growth in its productivity growth calculations, and therefore overstating productivity growth (unless GDP growth is also understated).</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s say for a moment that the Household Survey is more accurately capturing employment growth.  The reported growth has been strong enough to raise the employment-population rate so the unemployment rate has declined even as the labor force participation rate has inched up.  So perhaps we are getting closer to full employment even if <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/are-at-full-employment-yet.html">we are not there yet</a>.</p>
<p><em>A Footnote on Footnotes</em>:  AB readers will likely ask whether I checked about the following footnote given some of my posts on those who <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/employment-growth-abuse-of-household.html">fail to do so</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Data affected by changes in population controls in January 2000, January 2003, January 2004, January 2005, and January 2006.</p></blockquote>
<p>The reported increase in employment per the Household Survey from December 2005 to January 2006 was 295,000 which did exceed the reported increase in employment per the Payroll Survey but also note that the employment-population ratio increased from 62.8% to 62.9%.  Contrast that to the following observation:<br />
<blockquote>Consider the fact that reported employment was 136.4 million in December 2002 but appeared to jump to 137.4 million in January 2003. Did the employment to population ratio jump accordingly? Let’s see, it was 62.4% in December 2002 and 62.5% the next month. So very little of this increase can be attributed to anything other than some fluke coming from “changes in population controls”.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>With 4.4% unemployment, one AB reader asked me if we were in danger of demand-pull inflation.  My answer was that this was not likely with the employment-population ratio still at only 63.2% &#8211; and I had put forth the notion that the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/natural-employment-population-ratio.html">Natural Employment-Population Ratio</a> was near 64%.  </p>
<p>But why not the natural rate of unemployment you ask.  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/11/washington_post_the_unemployme.html#014323">Dean Baker</a> provides one answer:<br />
<blockquote>In the 90s, the unemployment rate first fell below 5% in May of 1997 and didn&#8217;t cross 5% again until October of 2001. During this four and a half year period, there was only a modest uptick in the inflation rate, much of which was attributable to a sharp rise in oil prices in 1999-2000. Back in the 90s, the Post would tell the public that economists believed that the unemployment rate could not get below 6.0 percent without generating inflation. This was the consensus within the profession. The low unemployment of the 90s proved that the mainstream consensus within the economics profession was wrong. But, rather than expand its array of sources to include economists who were not wrong about this issue, the Post simply goes back to the same folks who now use the same disproven economic theory with 5% as the magic number instead of 6%.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the natural rate of unemployment tends to move over time – and we are not really sure what the current level is.  As long-time AB readers know, I have pointed out that the unemployment rate is one minus the ratio of the employment-population ratio relative to the labor force participation rate.  I have also argued that the labor force participation rate will tend to rise back towards that circa 67% rate we saw before the 2001 recession.  Other economists have argued that there has been a voluntary decrease in labor force participation rate so not all of the decline represents the discourage worker effect (so much for the supply-side rational for those tax cuts). </p>
<p>Well it turns out, that <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/11/what_level_of_j.html">Mark Thoma</a> has spotted at least some evidence that my proposition is qualitatively correct: <br />
<blockquote>Participation has been increasing since the trough in January 2005, not decreasing (this graph ends at December 2005, but more recent participation figures do not alter the picture &#8211; see below). Furthermore, the scale of the graph is deceptive and the overall variation is small. Participation is 66.8% in January 1995 at the beginning of the graph, and 66.2% for the latest available observation for September 2006, only a .6% difference. The peak is 67.3% in January 2000, and the trough is 65.8% in January 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark’s post was reacting to <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2006/11/02/fed-holds-different-view-on-jobs-equilibrium">Grep Ip</a> noting that the Federal Reserve believes that the labor force participation rate will naturally trend downwards with demographic charges to lowering the amount of job creation needed to keep the economy at full employment.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/11/the_october_emp_1.html">Menzie Chinn</a> also has some interesting thoughts on this debate. <br />
<blockquote>There has been much hullaballoo about how tight the labor market is given the upward revisions in the August and September figures, on top of the preliminary benchmark revision reported last month &#8230; The current expansion&#8217;s employment growth (still) looks rather lackluster. However, as noted above, various observers have argued that the lower particpation rate of recent years implies a lower rate of employment growth necessary to accomplish labor market equilibrium. In order to investigate this assertion, I ignore the fact that the participation rate is an endogenous variable, and plot in Figure 2 the official payroll series (blue), the adjusted-for-preliminary-benchmark revision payroll employment series (red), and the BLS&#8217;s household employment series adjusted to mimic the establishment series, all divided by the labor force (variable CLF16OV, in FRED II mnemonics). Obviously, since the household and establishment series are collected in different ways, dividing the payroll series by the labor force is not a perfect measure, but hopefully it will pick up the relevant trends … What is clear is that only in the case of the BLS&#8217;s &#8220;adjusted&#8221; household series is the labor market nearly as tight as it was at the peak of the 1991-01 expansion. Obviously, using the official payroll employment series, the labor market is not so tight, roughly comparable to the conditions prevailing in 1996. Even incorporating in an ad hoc manner the preliminary benchmark revision, one finds the current market, as measured by the establishment survey, is about at the same level as it was in 1997. Indeed, the strong performance in the last three months now looks very much like a slackening market. Finally, my skepticism regarding the tight market scenario is buttressed by an inspection of the employment cost (wages plus benefits) index, deflated by either the CPI or the Personal Consumption Expenditure deflator (chain-type index).</p></blockquote>
<p>This last point is quite important.  One would think that real compensation would be higher if we were at full employment.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This post is not particularly original or profound.  I just found myself thinking of the debt, and decided to check the data.  OMB Table 7.1 provides data on the debt.  The gross debt in 2005 was 7.9 trillion, give or take some change.  It’s a really big number that means nothing to a simple guy like me.  I can’t envision a trillion, much less 7.9 of them.  </p>
<p>So I divided through per person.  The debt per capita was $23,581.  OK.  I can picture that.  But has it been rising or falling, and how has each President done?  For that, one has to adjust by inflation to know for certain.</p>
<p>Below are the geometric means of the percentage yearly changes in real gross debt per capita, and in real debt held by the public per capita, going back a few presidencies:</p>
<p>Ike_____-2.11%___-2.47%<br />JFK____-1.26%___-1.18%<br />LBJ____-0.14%___-0.97%<br />Nixon__-1.51%___-3.10%<br />Ford____0.73%____2.64%<br />Carter___1.27%____3.13%<br />Reagan__7.12%____7.40%<br />GHW___6.84%____4.93%<br />Clinton__1.31%___-1.31%<br />GW_____2.57%___0.36%</p>
<p>(And yes, for Clinton the figures are indeed, coincidentally, symmetric.)</p>
<p>Looking at things a different way…. The table below shows the yearly change in the gross debt as a percentage of GDP and debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP:</p>
<p>Ike_____-2.28___-1.99<br />JFK____-1.43___-1.10<br />LBJ____-1.86___-1.80<br />Nixon__-1.48____-1.58<br />Ford____1.30____1.80<br />Carter__-0.73___-0.35<br />Reagan__2.33____1.86<br />GHW___3.05____1.78<br />Clinton_-0.76___-1.63<br />GW____1.26____0.46</p>
<p>That’s 10 Presidents, of whom only 4 – Ford, Reagan, GHW, and GW – managed to increase the debt no matter which way you look at it.  Now, perhaps something was accomplished with all this debt….   Growth, perhaps?  Well, yes!  The geometric mean of the yearly growth rate in real GDP per capita during the Ford, Reagan, GHW and GW presidencies was a staggering 1.64%.  Meanwhile, the other presidents delivered increases in real GDP per capita of a mere 2.32% a year.  Someone call the Club for Growth and the NRO – if they have managed to conclude that tax cuts are the way to get higher growth, the evidence favoring a bazillion dollar debt is <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/tax-rates-real-gdp-growth-rates-and.html"> just as strong.</a>  I would say they should be bragging about GW’s debt, not trying to distant themselves from it.  </p>
<p>Data<br />Debt:  <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid"> OMB Table 7.1 </a><br />Population:  Through 1961, used Q3 data from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid"> BEA NIPA Table 7.1 </a> and for 1962 onward, used <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist17z5.xls"> OMB Table 17.5 </a><br />CPI:  Used average from September of previous year to August from the <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt"> BLS </a><br />Real GDP per capita:  <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid"> BEA NIPA Table 7.1 </a></p>
<p>Update:  Corrected a typo on the growth rate in real GDP in non-Ford, Reagan, GHW and GW years.</p>

                                <p>Henry Kissinger is apparently giving similar advice to the Bush Administration on Iraq that he gave to the Nixon Administration during the Vietnam War.  Via <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/11/henry_kissinger.html">Brad DeLong</a> comes <a href="http://www.tnr.com/user/nregi.mhtml?i=20061106&#038;s=perlstein110606">Rick Perlstein</a>: <br />
<blockquote>To begin unraveling the true meaning of Kissinger&#8217;s advice to the White House, we have to go back to August 3, 1972. On that date, President Nixon repeated to the good doctor, his national security adviser, what he&#8217;d been saying in private since 1966: America&#8217;s war aim (standing up a pro-American and anti-Communist South Vietnamese government in Saigon) was a fantasy. &#8220;South Vietnam probably can never even survive anyway,&#8221; the president sighed. But a presidential election was coming up. He had long before promised he was removing the U.S. presence, more-or-less victoriously (though &#8220;victory&#8221; was a word Nixon, by then, wisely avoided; instead, he called it &#8220;peace with honor&#8221;). It was Kissinger, who had been shuttling back and forth to Paris for peace negotiations with the enemy, who named the dilemma: &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to find some formula that holds the thing together a year or two, after which&#8211;after a year, Mr. President, Vietnam will be a backwater. If we settle it, say, this October, by January &#8217;74, no one will give a damn.&#8221; Thus was confirmed what historians would come to call the &#8220;decent interval&#8221; strategy. Having pledged to Saigon&#8211;and American conservatives&#8211;that Communist troops would not be allowed in South Vietnam after a peace deal was signed, Kissinger negotiated the opposite. &#8220;Peace is at hand,&#8221; he announced on the eve of the 1972 presidential election, in one of his rare appearances before the TV cameras. The United States left the following spring; the Communists moved in; Saigon fell. That&#8217;s not how Nixon and Kissinger told the story, of course. They blamed the defeat on a combination of the liberal congressmen who refused to vote for continued aid to South Vietnam in 1974 and Saigon&#8217;s own unfortunate lack of will.</p></blockquote>
<p>The parallels to today are striking.  Standing up a pro-American democracy in Iraq is seen by most with any common sense as a fantasy.  So why do we stay?  The decent interval strategy has been revived – complete with bashing liberals as terrorist appeasers.  </p>
<p>But I’m puzzled by something.  Sure, I thought Richard Nixon’s 1968 peace with honor was lord of partisan BS – just as I thought Humphrey would have brought our troops home from Vietnam faster than Nixon would.  OK, I was too young to vote in 1968 but I was old enough to spot a liar when I saw one.  Likewise, I was very troubled with what was clearly the partisan “peace is at hand” uttered just before the 1972 Presidential Election.  And I have no doubt that President Nixon would sacrifice countless lives of American soldiers just to avoid the political consequences of a war gone bad.  In this regard – as well as many others – George W. Bush reminds me of perhaps the most corrupt President in American history (well, the most corrupt before George W. Bush took office).</p>
<p>But here is what I do not understand.  There were prospects for a peace deal between the U.S. and the North Vietnamese during both 1968 and 1969.  <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines/080900-01.htm">Martin Kettle </a> suggests that Nixon undermined President Johnson’s attempts in 1968:<br />
<blockquote>On the eve of his election in 1968, Richard Nixon secretly conspired with the South Vietnamese government to wreck all-party Vietnam peace talks as part of a deliberate effort to prolong a conflict in which more than 20,000 Americans were still to die, along with tens of thousands of Vietnamese and Cambodians. The devastating new charge against Nixon, which mirrors long-held suspicions among members of President Lyndon Johnson&#8217;s administration about the Republican leader&#8217;s actions in the autumn of 1968, is made by the authors of a new study of Nixon&#8217;s secret world in the latest issue of Vanity Fair magazine. &#8220;The greatest honour history can bestow,&#8221; reads the inscription on Nixon&#8217;s black granite tombstone in California, &#8220;is the title of peacemaker.&#8221; But if the charges by authors Anthony Summers and Robbyn Swan are correct, Nixon better deserves to be called a peacewrecker than peacemaker. At the heart of the new account was Nixon&#8217;s fear that Vietnam peace efforts by President Johnson in the run-up to the November 1968 US presidential election could wreck Nixon&#8217;s bid to oust Hubert Humphrey, the Democratic candidate, and capture the White House. Nixon&#8217;s response to Johnson&#8217;s efforts was to use a go-between, Anna Chennault, to urge the South Vietnam&#8217;s president, Nguyen van Thieu, to resist efforts to force them to the peace table. Nixon&#8217;s efforts paid off spectacularly. On October 31, Johnson ordered a total halt to the bombing of North Vietnam, the precondition for getting the North and their Vietcong allies to join the talks. Two days later, under intense secret urgings from Nixon and his lieutenants, Thieu announced his government would not take part. Less than a week later, Nixon was elected president with less than a one-point margin in the popular vote over Humphrey. The Vanity Fair article charges that Johnson knew what was going on. Intelligence reports to the president told him that Nixon and his running mate, Spiro Agnew, were playing politics with the lives of US soldiers. &#8220;Had it been made public at the time, it would surely have destroyed Nixon&#8217;s presidential hopes at one stroke, and forever,&#8221; the authors write.   Johnson offered Humphrey the chance to go public about Nixon, but Humphrey was afraid that the charges would be seen as election dirty tricks. Once Nixon had won, Johnson again contemplated revealing what he knew, but decided the national interest precluded it. In the weeks running up to the election, Nixon&#8217;s public stance was that, if elected, he would bring the war to an end more effectively than Humphrey. He promised not to interfere with pre-election peace efforts, pledging that neither he nor Agnew &#8220;will destroy the chance of peace&#8221;. In reality, however, Nixon used his campaign manager, John Mitchell, later his disgraced attorney general, to use go-betweens to encourage Thieu to believe he would get a better deal under a Nixon administration and to boycott the putative talks. Nixon constantly denied that he was conspiring with Thieu against the US government, but the release of previously classified FBI files used by the authors show this was exactly what he was doing. Chennault, Nixon&#8217;s main go-between with the South Vietnamese, was a right-wing Republican society hostess who was Chinese born and lived in a newly constructed Washington apartment complex &#8211; named the Watergate. She was vice-chairman of the Republican election finance committee and an inveterate lobbyist on behalf of right-wing and pro-American Asian interests. Chennault regularly passed messages to Mitchell and Nixon during 1968 and they urged her to put pressure on the South Vietnamese leader to create delays and to refuse to take part in the peace talks.</p></blockquote>
<p>If these accusations are true, none of this would shock me given my low regard for Richard Nixon.  But once Nixon was President, how come we could not come up with a peace deal with the North Vietnamese in 1969?  Then again – how come the current President can’t find some way for us to wind down our presence in Iraq?</p>
