                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ODMyMWU5NTY1MWNlNjgwYjZkYzk1MjJjYTVlYjZmM2Q=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> interviews Dr. Dick Cheney on what the stock market is telling us:<br />
<blockquote>In the last month’s run-up to the midterm elections, stocks have been climbing while Republican polls have been falling. Does this mean the markets favor gridlock in Washington, after six years of Republican rule? It’s an odd paradigm.  I put this question to Vice President Dick Cheney in Washington this week, during a special interview that aired on CNBC’s Kudlow &#038; Co. His answer was no. He disagrees with the market.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Say what?</strong>  Had a Democrat told Larry the stock market got something wrong, me thinks Larry would bust a few buttons on his cheap suit.  The rest of this op-ed from the GOP’s favorite suck-up goes onto to bash Congressman Rangel for being some big government liberal.  Never mind that Milton Friedman even admits <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/11/to_spend_is_to_.html">To Spend is to Tax</a>. </p>
<p>But let’s take a gander at the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=%5EGSPC&#038;t=3m">S&#038;P 500</a> for the past three months.  There was an increase in the stock market for much of this period but in the last few days, it has been declining.  A couple of things Larry should think about: (1) the determinants of the stock market go beyond his usual partisan nonsense; and (2) he might have checked recent developments in the stock market before he posted his column today.  </p>
<p>Then again – the question isn’t whether the Vice President trusts the stock market.  It’s more like whether those investing in stocks trust this Administration’s commitment to fiscal responsibility.  Then again – can we trust anything that comes out of Dick Cheney’s mouth?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/009994.php">Kevin Drum</a> comes another round of excuses from the National Review – this time from some fellow named <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZGEzOWJhNTc2ZTg5MDEyYzA4N2YwM2MzOWIwZWI1ZmE">J. Edward Carter</a>.  Who is J. Edward Carter?  Kevin explains:<br />
<blockquote>But who is J. Edward Carter? His tagline says, mysteriously, only that &#8220;Mr. Carter is an economist in Washington, D.C.&#8221; What does that J stand for?  Answer: James. He&#8217;s James E. Carter, deputy undersecretary for international affairs in the Department of Labor. In other words, a political appointee in the Bush administration. I wonder why National Review didn&#8217;t want anyone to know this?</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s hear Mr. Carter out as he has two lines of “reasoning”.  His second and third “clues” as to why the January 2001 CBO surplus of $5.6 trillion in unified budget surpluses over the first decade of the 21st century did not materialize basically goes like this – we haven’t had this kind of surplus in a long time and the policymakers (that’d be President Bush and a GOP dominated Congress) never intended to let this sustained surplus last.  Well, no sh*t Sherlock as President Bush had no intention of maintaining the commitment to pre-fund Social Security.  In other words, his intent all along was to be fiscally irresponsible.  But let’s also consider his first “clue”:</p>
<blockquote><p>The $5.6 trillion surplus was a mirage. It never existed. The CBO based its surplus estimate on the existing tax and spending laws and on an economic forecast that simply did not stand the test of time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Absolutely correct.  Carter correctly notes that Bush’s tax cuts lowered tax revenues.  Something his <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTkyZGIwZjYyYjNiOTc4YTgzMWFkZWJmNzczYTY1OWI=">NRO colleagues</a> are still trying to deny.  But Carter does spin this too much on the spending increase side as opposed to the lost revenue side.  Carter’s argument seems to be – don’t blame Bush for the fact that the rubber stamp Congress gave him exactly what he asked for.  While we are at it – let’s not blame Bush for Iraq as it was Congress that went along and the Generals who followed his orders.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: One of Kevin’s readers found the bio for <a href="http://www.dol.gov/ilab/leadership.htm">James Carter</a>, which reads in part:<br />
<blockquote>He holds a master&#8217;s degree in public administration from George Mason University and a bachelor&#8217;s degree in political science from Truman State University. Carter has authored more than 70 articles in such publications as Investor&#8217;s Business Daily, The Washington Times, USA Today, National Review and the New York Post.</p></blockquote>
<p>The National Review thinks Carter is an economist?  I seriously doubt the economics faculty at this <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics">fine school</a> is about to give him a tenure track offer.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: The Montana GOP is running an ad called <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/010774.php">BrokeBank Democrats</a>.  You see – the GOP is saying that this Jon Tester’s “nature” has nothing to do with sexual orientation but it has to do with the fact that Tester is not in favor of more tax cuts.   If so &#8211; the ad has this backwards, however, as the GOP drive for cutting taxes while raising spending is what really is breaking the bank.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> announced employment gains for October 2006, which will be their last report before Election Day.  The GOP has been trying to telling us that this is the best economy ever whether measured by real GDP growth or by employment growth.  Now, it may be true that real GDP growth had been rather decent from mid-2003 to mid-2006 but if one takes a six-year perspective rather than a three-year perspective, real GDP growth averaged less than 2.5% per year.  In other words, the recession was followed by a weak recovery. But the GOP spinmeisters kept focusing on the short-run, which is why that announcement that real GDP growth had slowed to around 1.6% had to be a kick in the teeth for them. </p>
<p>But of course, they could always turn to employment.  Of course, the increase in employment since George W. Bush took office (over five and a half years) has been a miserable 3 million per the payroll survey.  Of course, the GOP spinmeisters focus on what’s happened since mid-2003 forgetting all about the decline in employment for the first two and a half years.  And over the third quarter of 2006, employment growth had averaged only 120 thousand per month.  The news for October was that employment grew by only 92,000. </p>
<p>But what about the household survey?  What about the unemployment rate?  Well, let’s take a look at the employment-population ratio (EP) and the labor force participation (LFP) rate since 1997 with the unemployment rate (UN) being one minus EP/LFP.  While EP equaled or exceeded 64% from late 1997 to April 2001, it declined to 62% by September 2003.  For all the talk about recovery, EP reached was between 63% to 63.1% from March 2006 to September 2006.  But, it turns out that reported EP increased to 63.2% as reported employment per the household survey increased by 437,000.</p>
<p>The GOP has been crowing about how unemployment has declined from its 6.3% rate in June 2003 to 4.6% as of September 2003.  And the headline for the GOP talking points will be that the unemployment rate in October was 4.4%.  Of course, this rate is higher than the 4% unemployment rate that George W. Bush inherited and some of the recent decline is attributable to a fall in the labor force participation rate.  Odd – I thought those supply-side tax cuts was supposed to encourage a greater labor supply.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As k harris points out, the revised payroll employment figures for the third quarter of 2006 show an increase of 501,000 not 362,000.  To be honest, I had created much of my post last night hoping to be one of the first to post on this.  But as I was sipping my first cup of coffee waking for my computer to boot up at 6AM on the west coast, our friend <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/11/october-employment-report.html">CalculatedRisk</a> had already put up his post.  And yes, he is just a few miles south of me.</p>

<p>I hate to differ with <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2006/11/is-great-productivity-boom-over.html">Kash</a> but quarter by quarter productivity changes is a noisy series.  Productivity growth in 2006QI was strong but has been weak since then.  Who knows what the fourth quarter will bring? </p>
<p><a href="http://stefanmikarlsson.blogspot.com/2006/11/bad-report-on-economy-could-be-good.html">Stefan Karlsson</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>Productivity growth on the previous quarter fell to zero, and year over year productivity growth fell to 1.3%-the lowest since 1997. But even as productivity growth have dramatically accelerated, compensation fo labor have in fact accelerated. Real compensation is now up 3.2% over the previous year and unit labor costs is up 5.3%. While we will have to wait until the next GDP report for the first statistics on third quarter corporate profits, it seems likely that corporate profits fell.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the last four quarters on average has been a bit disappointing for productivity growth and real compensation has increased a bit.  So perhaps the declining labor share is finally over.  But go back to Kash’s graph of productivity growth and real compensation growth and notice there have been quite a few years where real compensation failed to keep pace with productivity.</p>

                                <p>How dare I mix these two discussions you ask?  Well, the Corner Kids are not discussing the fact that one of our soldiers has been abducted and apparently abandoned by the Commander in Chief.  I guess they are too busy bashing Senator Kerry.</p>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjZiMjU5NGQ1YjUyMWZkMTdhYmM5YjA2NjM1ODhkMWE=">Jonah Goldberg</a>, however, is elated that “wages and benefits moved up” pointing to <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-0611010020nov01,0,5243746.story?coll=chi-business-hed">this discussion</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Wages and benefits paid to American workers rose last quarter by the most since 2004, as the unemployment rate matched a five-year low. The Labor Department said Tuesday that its employment cost index rose 1 percent compared with the second quarter. In the 12 months ended in September, costs shot up 3.3 percent, the biggest year-over-year advance since the first quarter of 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gee Jonah – nominal compensation typically goes up.  Aren’t you in the least bit curious whether the nominal compensation increases was greater or less than the increase in the cost of living.  But <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/real-compensation-still-below-where-it.html">take heart</a> as real compensation did rise by 1.2% over the past 12 month, but not enough to completely offset the decline in real compensation during the earlier 12 month period.  I guess Jonah never realized that the “talk about stagnating wages” was referring to real compensation.  </p>
<p>But this is just a prelude to tomorrow’s new about employment during October 2006.  Stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NjYwMDVjZjUwNjk0ZGUzZjQyZjliMDk4ZWU1YzQxMmQ=">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> is interested in something else altogether:<br />
<blockquote>A review of the excerpts clearly reveals that The Emperor&#8217;s General contains a number of instances of significant plagiarism from Japan&#8217;s Imperial Conspiracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>First, Webb’s novels are full of smut and now they are plagiarized!  I wonder if Webb copied his alleged smut from David Bergamini?  I also have to wonder how much George Allen paid Ramesh Ponnuru for this hit job.</p>

<blockquote>In the wake of Sen. John Kerry’s belated apology for offending troops deployed in Iraq, House Majority Leader Rep. John Boehner of Ohio is being asked by Democrats to apologize for seemingly blaming senior military officers for any problems with the Bush administration’s Iraq strategy. Boehner, however, does not appear to be budging. “Good try,” he said when asked about demands for an apology. In a Wednesday appearance on CNN, Boehner was asked for his view on Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and the U.S. policy in Iraq. “There are a lot of people who want to blame what’s happening in Iraq on Donald Rumsfeld, but when you look at the transformation that our military has been through, it’s nothing short of remarkable,” Boehner said. “The fact is, the generals on the ground are in charge.” Boehner acknowledged that “there have been mistakes along the way,” but did not blame Rumsfeld. Rumsfeld, Boehner said, has been pushing the military to transform, but the uniformed military leaders have resisted. “You have to understand that the generals who have been in charge of the Pentagon have been very resistant to change,” Boehner said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rick gets only one thing wrong – John Kerry did not call our troops stupid.  And he did apologize for any misunderstanding.  Boehner said he would beat Kerry to death if he did not apologize.  But when Boehner insults our generals rather than blame the Commander-in-Chief, he owes us know apology?  I bet <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/guess-andrew-sullivan-will-not-be.html">Tony Snow</a> has a ready explanation, which goes something like this.  As Snow told the press corp:<br />
<blockquote>I mean, you and I and everybody in this room have said things that we didn’t intend to say. And when it offends people, you say, I’m sorry.</p></blockquote>
<p>We noted the converse:<br />
<blockquote>Let’s see. Mr. Snow has made a lot of disgusting accusations based on lies for which he has not apologized. Same goes for President Bush and Vice President Cheney. But I guess they intended to lie in a way that offends people.</p></blockquote>
<p>So I presume that Boehner intended to insult our troops. Did <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/michael-steele-on-iraq-blaming.html">Michael Steele</a> also intend to insult the generals?  There does seem to be a GOP pattern developing.</p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15527564">the press</a> is finally reporting the news of that abducted soldier and we now know his name:<br />
<blockquote>The U.S. military identified a kidnapped soldier for the first time on Thursday, saying he was 41-year-old Ahmed Qusai al-Taayie.  Maj. Gen. William B. Caldwell also confirmed widely published reports that the reserve soldier was visiting his Iraqi wife when he was handcuffed and taken away by gunmen during a visit to the woman&#8217;s family. The soldier&#8217;s name first became known after a woman claiming to be his mother-in-law told the story of the interpreter&#8217;s allegedly secret marriage three months ago and his abduction on Oct. 23 &#8230; The spokesman said the United States believed the soldier was still in the custody of his abductors and there was &#8220;an ongoing dialogue&#8221; to win the his release.

<p>An ongoing dialogue with his abductors?  Are you serious?  <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/the_war_in_iraq_/2006/10/cutting_and_running_from_sadr_city.php">Mark Kleiman</a> calls this cut and run – and <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/11/abandoning_an_a.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> suggests that the Commander-in-Chief has abandoned Ahmed Qusai al-Taayie.  Our soldiers deserve better than this.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of blogging about that increase in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/us-motor-vehicle-production-and.html">motor vehicle production</a> including some thoughts from <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/009958.php">Kevin Drum</a>, which begins with:<br />
<blockquote>Did GDP increase 1.6% last quarter? Only if you believe that auto production increased 26%, the estimate used by the BEA in its calculation of 3rd quarter GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>But table 7.2.1B (Percent Change from Preceding Period in Real Motor Vehicle Output) from the BEA’s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/index.asp">NIPA tables</a> does not say that.  It indicates that motor vehicle production seasonally adjusted rose by 25.7% (at an annualized rate which really is a 6.4% increase over the previous quarter).  Reported auto output rose by only 4% at an annualized rate, while reported truck output rose by 39.9% at an annualized rate.  </p>
<p>As we discussed yesterday, the increase in final sales of motor vehicles to domestic purchases was less dramatic as one of the contributors to this reported increase was a rise in exports and a fall in imports.  While folks might be surprised given the troubles of the Big Three, <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/incredible-shrinking-car-company.html">Kash</a> reminds us that other companies (e.g., Toyota) have production facilities in the U.S.  </p>
<p>So maybe we are buying more Toyotas from the local Toyota plants or we are exporting a few more home grown Toyotas abroad.  Not good news for Detroit perhaps, but these are the National Income Product Accounts – not the accounts for Ford and GM.</p>
<p>Kevin is also pointing to an apparent difference in what the Federal Reserve is reporting v. what BEA is reporting and wondering about price indices.  I have graphed the nominal price indices for both automobiles and for trucks.  Both rose generally rose from 1993 to 2000 with truck prices generally declining since then.  In inflation-adjusted terms, the relative prices of both autos and trucks have declined over the past several years according to BEA data.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/11/abandoning_an_a.html">Sulli</a> is getting a lot of well deserved praise for this:<br />
<blockquote>The commander-in-chief has abandoned an American soldier to the tender mercies of a Shiite militia &#8230; The U.S. military does not have a tradition of abandoning its own soldiers to foreign militias, or of taking orders from foreign governments. No commander-in-chief who actually walks the walk, rather than swaggering the swagger, would acquiesce to such a thing.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you for saying this as the news seems to be focused on that Kerry dust-up.  And thanks for the comment about the priorities of John McCain:<br />
<blockquote>And where, by the way, is McCain on this? Silent on Cheney&#8217;s &#8220;no-brainer&#8221; on waterboarding. Silent recently on Iraq. But vocal &#8211; oh, how vocal &#8211; on Kerry. It tells you something about what has happened to him. And to America.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/11/01/snow-kerry-apologize">Judd</a> reminds us what a twit Tony Snow really is.  Mr. Snow:<br />
<blockquote>SNOW: You know, two words really are sufficient to convey an apology: I’m sorry. And he hasn’t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes it has.  But then Tony Snow is used to lying.  Snow continues:<br />
<blockquote>All he has to do &#8211; it’s really easy &#8211; say, I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to offend the troops.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kerry said that yesterday.  But let’s back up:<br />
<blockquote>I mean, you and I and everybody in this room have said things that we didn’t intend to say. And when it offends people, you say, I’m sorry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s see.  Mr. Snow has made a lot of disgusting accusations based on lies for which he has not apologized.  Same goes for President Bush and Vice President Cheney.  But I guess they intended to lie in a way that offends people. </p>
<p>But let’s talk about something a little more vital to our troops – what is the Commander in Chief doing about that captured soldier.  As far as I can see – not a single thing as he is too busy being a partisan hack by lying about some remark said by one Democrat on the campaign trail.  Lord – I wish we had a President who understand what his real job was.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: While <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/01/kerry.remarks/index.html">CNN</a> is definitely overplaying this fake story, they get one thing right:<br />
<blockquote>A Kerry aide said the senator was supposed to say, &#8220;I can&#8217;t overstress the importance of a great education. Do you know where you end up if you don&#8217;t study, if you aren&#8217;t smart, if you&#8217;re intellectually lazy? You end up getting us stuck in a war in Iraq.&#8221; Appearing Wednesday on radio host Don Imus&#8217; program, &#8220;Imus in the Morning,&#8221; Kerry said, &#8220;I&#8217;m going back to Washington. I&#8217;m going back to tackle this, you bet.&#8221; &#8220;Of course, I&#8217;m sorry about a botched joke,&#8221; he added. &#8220;Everybody knows I botched a joke.&#8221;&#8221;They shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to do that,&#8221; the Massachusetts lawmaker said. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let these guys lie and smear, and they put their whole machine out to do it, and they ought to apologize.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So as our comment box is getting flooded with some unnamed GOP hack with comments about Kerry being a coward, the facts show otherwise.  But he is right about what Cheney is doing:<br />
<blockquote>Vice President Dick Cheney will enter the fray Wednesday night during a speech in Montana. The White House released the portion of Cheney&#8217;s speech pertaining to Kerry. &#8220;John Kerry needs to learn that the men and women serving in Iraq aren&#8217;t there because they didn&#8217;t study hard or do their homework,&#8221; Cheney is set to say. &#8220;They&#8217;re smart, patriotic, exceptionally well-trained and dedicated to their mission. They are heroes, and they are the pride of the United States of America.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Oh joy!</em></strong>  The partisan liar who was very influential in getting our brave soldiers stuck in Iraq is about to go on the attack with more cherry picked quotes to misrepresent what Senator Kerry has said.  Here is your opportunity Democrats – dust off some Cheney quotes from the past, but do be more honest and only tell us what he really said.  After all, there is so much choice material from this chickenhawk liar.  One would think this White House would want to avoid the Iraq debate this week – but I say “Bring It On”!</p>
<p>Which is what <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/theplank?pid=53336">Michael Crowley</a> does as he writes this line for Kerry:<br />
<blockquote>I bungled a joke, Bush bungled a war. Let the voters decide what&#8217;s more important?</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I like to post data, and I like to make my spreadsheets available to anyone who wants them.  It keeps me honest.  It also means that sometimes my mistakes get caught.  Sure, there’s egg on my face, but hopefully I learn something from it.</p>
<p>Reader M. Jed has pointed out that at times I’ve been using straight averages of percentage growth rates when I should be using the geometric mean.  It’s a stupid mistake, and I apologize for it.  As time permits, I’ll go back to old posts and make corrections where necessary.</p>
<p>But I would like to focus on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/tax-rates-tax-cuts-and-growth-of-gdp.html"> the post </a> where M. Jed pointed out the error.  It looked at growth rates in real gdp per capita following tax cuts, tax hikes, and years in which tax rates remained the same.  If I haven’t made a mistake (insert very nervous chuckle), using data beginning in 1981, when Reagan took office, the average of the geometric mean growth rate after x years following a cut, hike, or no change in the highest personal marginal rate:</p>
<p>_________________tax hike___tax unchanged_tax cut<br />year 0______________-0.07______2.79______0.87<br />year 0 to year + 1______2.30______5.08______2.51<br />year 0 to year + 2______1.81______3.57______2.66<br />year 0 to year + 3______2.08______3.07______2.45<br />year 0 to year + 4______2.13______2.82______2.26<br />year 0 to year + 5______2.25______2.61______2.33<br />year 0 to year + 6______2.42______2.47______2.35<br />year 0 to year + 7______2.46______2.36______2.36</p>
<p>In other words, the year of a tax cut, growth rate averages 0.87%, and in the year of a tax cut through 7 years later, growth rates average 1.77%.</p>
<p>To summarize, the year of a tax cut, through as many as 6 years later, keeping taxes unchanged outperforms tax cuts and tax hikes.  Hiking taxes outperforms keeping taxes constant and cutting taxes between any given year and 7 years later, and hiking taxes outperforms cutting taxes in the last two out years.</p>
<p>Results are similar using data beginning in 1978.  Using data beginning in 1984, tax hikes outperform tax cuts starting four years out.  And results are similar using medians of the geometric means rather than averages.  </p>
<p>Conclusion…  For the range of taxes we have observed over the past 25 years or so, over the short run, a tax cut will lead to faster growth than a tax hike (though both are outperformed by keeping taxes constant).  Over a longer period, the tax cut does not lead to faster growth than tax hikes.  </p>
<p>What’s the mechanism?  Well, here’s my guess…  Cutting taxes provides some stimulus (apparently not very well, since keeping taxes constant outperforms tax cuts), but mean either less government spending today or more borrowing.  In either case, that means less government spending, either today or in the future, which means less government spending, either today or in the future.  Government spending on public goods is necessary for the long-term growth of the country, and has few private sector substitutes.  Thus, cutting taxes today leads to slower growth in the future.</p>
<p>Put another way… cutting taxes today means reducing growth rates in someone else’s administration.  Not surprisingly, Presidents that are willing to impose costs of tax cuts on their successors are willing to compound the problem by increasing spending quite a bit at the same time.</p>
<p>Data <br /><a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid"> Real GDP per capita (NIPA Table 7.1) </a><br /><a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histaba.pdf"> Highest marginal tax rates </a></p>
<p>As always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.</p>
<p>Update &#8211; &#8220;Over a longer period, the tax cut does not lead to faster growth than tax hikes&#8221; now reads correctly.</p>
