<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/another-post-on-kudlow.html">Cactus</a> says that Lawrence Kudlow knows his data.  Really?  Then explain <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZWJjZGVlZTdlZGVjM2YyZmVjN2MwNzZiMGQ5NWMxODM=">this</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Ben Stein says we can’t cut spending. But in fact, as a share of GDP, Ronald Reagan cut spending from about 23 percent down to 20 percent; Clinton and the Gingrich Congress lowered spending to 18 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our graph plots Federal spending from 1977 to 2000.  Federal spending as a share of GDP was 21.0% in 1980 and 21.5% in 1981.  It was 21.4% in 1989 and did not drop to 20% or less until 1998.  Yes, during the 1982 (Reagan) recession, Federal spending as a share of (declining in real terms) GDP was 23%.  Kudlow’s only correct statement is that Federal spending fell during the Clinton Administration reaching 19% of GDP by 2000.  Kudlow forgets to tell his readers that the reason Federal spending fell was a substantial reduction in defense spending, which was attributed to that temporary “peace dividend”.  Of course, the GOP tends to be in favor of more defense spending – not less.</p>
<p>Is Kudlow guilty of stupidity or mendacity?  If Cactus is correct that Larry knows his data, he is counting on the proposition that his readers don’t – so he lie to them, which apparently he does with regularity.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I’ve been caught in a bit of a typo – the 21.4% refers to 1988 whereas Federal spending/GDP was 21.3% in 1989.  OK, fire away with the accusations that I “lied”!</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>What would happen if Coalition (at this point, that pretty much means US) forces left Iraq?  </p>
<p>Well, some say that US forces are the only thing holding back even wider scale bloodshed &#8211; after all, in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/27/AR2006112701287.html"> some areas where the US has lost complete control</a>, attacks on civilians seem to be particularly bad.  </p>
<p>Others say that US forces are what is keeping the fighting going.  It doesn&#8217;t seem likely that US withdrawal would lead to the lion lying down with the lamb so to speak, but who knows, it might precipitate a more or less peaceful partition (a la India, Pakistan, and eventually, Bangladesh after the British left).</p>
<p>None of us knows for sure.  But&#8230; the fact is, the administration and its supporters are the ones who are most insistent on the storyline in which the US is the one finger in the dam holding back the floodwaters.  As others have pointed out before &#8211; the administration has been wrong on everything they&#8217;ve told us when it comes to Iraq so far (as well as everything about their other big ticket item, the tax cuts).  So&#8230; why would they be right about this?</p>
<p>A few questions:<br />1.  Can we reasonably assume that the administration is wrong because, well, they&#8217;ve always been wrong so far?  Bear in mind that up until recently, they&#8217;ve been wrong about things being rosy.  Are they also wrong when they say things would be awful?<br />2.  What would happen if the US withdrew?<br />3.  What should the US do when it comes to Iraq?</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZWJjZGVlZTdlZGVjM2YyZmVjN2MwNzZiMGQ5NWMxODM="> Larry Kudlow </a> knows his data.  But it seems to me he takes pains to present it just so.</p>
<p>For instance, he writes things like:  “as a share of GDP, Ronald Reagan cut spending from about 23 percent down to 20 percent.”  He also writes things like:  “Only recently, under the Bush Republicans, has spending jumped back to slightly over 20 percent” and “Clinton and the Gingrich Congress lowered spending to 18 percent.”</p>
<p>Now, I’d like to expand on those points…</p>
<p>1.  Spending in 1980, the last fiscal year before Reagan took office, was 21.7 percent of GDP.  In 1988, his last fiscal year in office, spending was 21.3% of GDP.  That may be close enough to 20% for Kudlow, but most of the rest of us would have said &#8220;Ronald Reagan cut spending from about 23 percent down to 21 percent&#8221;, not 20 percent.  If you do the math, Reagan managed to decrease the size of the budget by 4 tenths of one percent of GDP, which makes him quite the fiscal conservative in Kudlow’s estimation.<br />2.  Now, (and this is why I say Kudlow knows his data), Reagan actually did cut spending from 23 percent down to 20 percent, well, not 20 percent, but rather 21.3 percent.  He managed that by first raising spending above 23 percent for two years in a row.  Thus, to comment Reagan for cutting spending from 23 percent is equivalent to praising GW for cutting the deficit in half – you don’t praise a guy for reducing the severity of the problem he himself created.<br />3.  Nice to see Kudlow that maybe Clinton had something to do with the cuts in spending.  Spending fell from 22.1 percent of GDP in 1992 to 18.4 percent of GDP in 2000.  But here’s the thing… it fell from 22.1 percent of GDP in 1992 to 21.0 percent of GDP in 1994, the year before the Gingrich Congress arrived to do its spending cuts.  Now Kudlow is a smart man, he can do the math…  why would he give credit to the Gingrich Congress when the rate at which spending was being cut fell after Gingrich took over?  To most people, that would indicate that the Gingrich Congress was obstructing Clinton’s attempts to cut spending, would it not?</p>
<p>Now, we’ve looked at stuff Kudlow’s written here at Angry Bear before.  I think Kudlow knows precisely what he is doing  &#8211; I believe he is being dishonest, and I believe he knows he is being dishonest.  And I also believe that his employers know he is dishonest.  I am pretty sure an honest analysis would be easier to produce than the stuff that Kudlow writes.  And since he is paid so very much (I would bet he makes ten times what I make per year, when he has a bad year), it is my opinion they are paying him precisely because they want him to be dishonest.</p>
<p>And if you have been reading this site for more than a month or so, you probably know I think we are partly responsible when we treat Kudlow and his employers and other enablers as respectable.</p>
<p>Update&#8230;. I forgot to post the the link to where the data comes from.  My apologies.   The data is from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls"> Office of Management and Budget, Table 1.3.</a>   I&#8217;d hate for people reading this to think I simply made up the data.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/26/AR2006112600929.html">Sebastian Mallaby</a> wants us to believe that President Bush is open to all sorts of good ideas.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/010287.php">Kevin Drum</a> has addressed this canard:  </p>
<blockquote><p>During the 2005 debate, President Bush endorsed an idea that would inflict no cuts whatsoever on low-income workers and would allow the value of middle-class retirees&#8217; benefits to rise, albeit less quickly than now scheduled. Because this formula (devised by a Democrat named Robert Pozen) spreads the burden fairly, Democrats who worry about rising inequality should be open to it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/11/why_oh_why_cant_6.html">Brad DeLong</a> goes after the lead:<br />
<blockquote>They no longer regard &#8220;privatization&#8221; &#8211; the diversion of payroll taxes into personal accounts &#8211; as the starting point for negotiation. The solvency of Social Security, not a desire to promote an &#8220;ownership society,&#8221; is their main concern.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the only morsel left for this Angrybear to devour is this: <br />
<blockquote>The next question is where to put the extra revenue: into the notional Social Security trust fund or into personal accounts. The administration will prefer private accounts, partly because it would like a face-saving link to the president&#8217;s 2005 proposal but also because personal accounts provide a way of walling the revenue off from the general budget and so reduce the government&#8217;s tendency to spend it. Meanwhile, Democrats will prefer to put the money into the trust fund. They reason that any personal account created as part of a reform that cuts Social Security benefits is headed the wrong way: toward replacing the security of the traditional guaranteed benefit with the uncertainty of 401(k)-type investments.  Judging from the hints flying around Washington, the administration sees how to bridge this divide. Democrats may be allergic to personal Social Security accounts, but they are enthusiastic about other ideas for personal retirement accounts that just don&#8217;t have &#8220;Social Security&#8221; in the title. For example, Gene Sperling, a former Clinton adviser, has called for a &#8220;Universal 401(k)&#8221; that would extend the benefits of 401(k) saving to workers whose companies don&#8217;t offer such accounts. In Sperling&#8217;s vision, everyone would get the chance to contribute to an account and receive a government contribution as a match, with the most generous match going to low-income workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>My goodness – has George W. Bush start listening to those of us on the left and is now pushing for add-on accounts?  Does Mallaby understand that this position would be a complete flip-flop for the GOP?  Not that it isn’t a great idea, but Mallaby should let his readers know that it was Bush and his privatization crowd that opposed this idea.  </p>

                                <p>I would imagine its generally agreed that the earth will be warming a few degrees over the next few decades.  I don&#8217;t want to get involved in the dispute about whether this is due to natural causes, is caused by us, or is some combination of the two.</p>
<p>But (and I&#8217;m sure someone else has done this before)&#8230; how should the average American react, from a financial perspective?  Assume they can do nothing to effect a change and that global warming is coming.  Assume they make the median income for the US, and have a small amount of savings.  What should they be doing differently?  What investments should that person make?  Should that person move, and where to?  What about jobs &#8211; are there jobs whose prospects are going to get better or worse as a result of global warming?</p>
<p>Your thoughts?  (Let me throw in one ground rule &#8211; keep this relevant by sticking to what you think are feasible suggestions.)</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Help me out here – which is going to collapse first?  The credit worthiness of my state government (California) or the reputation of Meet the Press?  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15850729">Tim Russert</a> interviews for the position of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s campaign managing as he conducts perhaps the most kiss-ass interview I have ever seen.  To save you the pathetic details, let me focus on the fiscal policy portions of this charade. First up:<br />
<blockquote>Arnold Schwarzenegger’s 17-point victory alone commands some attention, since it is easily the most impressive score by any Republican in a Democratic-leaning state this year &#8211; and it suggests a future for pro-environment, pro-business, fiscally conservative and socially moderate politics.</p></blockquote>
<p>ARNOLD is for a minimum wage increase but he is described as pro-business?  ARNOLD is for more spending but he doesn’t talk about how we’ll pay for this and he is described as fiscally conservative?  </p>
<p>Let’s move on. When Schwarzenegger said the following:<br />
<blockquote>Well, the mistake was not on what we were trying to do, because we need the reforms, and I think slowly we are seeing reforms happening in California. But what was wrong in—was the approach.</p></blockquote>
<p>Russert could have followed-up by asking if the Governor was still pushing his conservative agenda while pretending to be a Democrat.  Did he?  Of course not.  Instead he let Schwarzenegger get away with the Bush cheerleading:<br />
<blockquote>Well, it’s basically being fiscally conservative, being socially moderate and you know, being environmentally progressive. I think that’s what it basically means. And you know, Tim, one of the most important things, I think, that this nation is facing is that we—while we must see economic progress—and I think we have had great progress economically and I think the Bush administration hasn’t gotten enough credit for that, the jobs are coming back, we have the lowest unemployment rate in 30 years or so, the economy’s booming—But we also have to protect the environment at the same time, and that’s what we are doing in California.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – that supply-side miracle in action!. Speaking of the free lunch supply-side nonsense, Russert followed up some softball critique from the National Review with his solitary question about California’s deficit:<br />
<blockquote>One of the issues that are confronting you is the continuing deficit in California and also the six million uninsured, without health insurance. The San Jose Mercury wrote an editorial on Friday and said this, “While other states have been racking up surpluses and squirreling away money, California has run up deficits and piled on debt. That can’t continue. In the latest five-year forecast, the non-partisan Legislative Analyst’s Office projects a $5 billion deficit in the coming year and a $4 billion deficit the year after. &#8230; Now, something’s got to give &#8211; either Gov. Schwarzenegger’s vow not to raise taxes or his campaign pledges to fix health care and reform education. The latter should be the priority. He shouldn’t abandon promises on behalf of students and the [6 million] uninsured. &#8230; Schwarzenegger should swallow hard and consider taxes: either a dedicated tax, like raising the tobacco tax, or a temporary tax. &#8230; [Another] option worth exploring: expanding the sales tax to include some professional services in exchange for reducing the sales tax rate.” How do you juggle that?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Uh oh – a real question – maybe.</strong>  Let’s see how Schwarzenegger handled this?<br />
<blockquote>Well, Tim, when I came into office, they said exactly the same thing: I got to raise taxes, I got to raise taxes, please raise taxes by at least 5 billion or $8 billion a year. And I said, “No. We’re going to stimulate the economy,” and that’s exactly what we’ve done, we’ve stimulated the economy. Now our revenues went up by $20 billion, first from 76 billion to $96 billion without raising taxes. That is the way to go. I think what we have to do in the future is, is we’ve got to go and pay down our debt, which we have been doing. And we have done a tremendous job of bringing down the structural deficit from $16 ½ billion when I took office to now $4 ½ billion. And we’re going to come down further this year and we’re going to eliminate it by next year or the year after that. I think that’s what we need to do. Never raise taxes, it wouldn’t happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now one would think that Russert would hammer this free lunch BS, but no – Russert’s follow-up was why the U.S. wasn’t letting ARNOLD run for President.  Look – I’d like a real governor whether he was a slash and burn conservative or a Democrat who was honest enough to tell me that ARNOLD’s spending on roads and education means I’ll have to pay more taxes.  But we Californians were stupid enough to re-elect a “big government” pandering lying wimp.  We have to deal with own our stupidity for four years, but why on earth hasn’t NBC fired Tim Russert?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I partially agree with <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_11_26_atrios_archive.html#116457446238819253">Duncan Black</a> when he writes this:<br />
<blockquote>There is no problem with the Social Security system. People who continue to argue that there is &#8211; and that the problem can be &#8220;solved&#8221; with the magic private accounts fairy &#8211; either have broken brains or are attempting to push an agenda for ideological reasons or for personal enrichment for themselves and their kind.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <em>partial</em> agreement relates to his mocking the “magic private fairy accounts”, but is there a long-run shortfall?  Yes – a very modest one that those who “push an agenda for ideological reasons” (e.g., George W. Bush) falsely claim is HUGE.  But I have to protest the opening of Duncan’s post:<br />
<blockquote>Look, people who advocate adding &#8220;personal accounts&#8221; to Social Security are just stupid people. Really, just morons. There&#8217;s no reason to do it. There&#8217;s no reason to take any part of Social Security contributions and put them in a little fund account with my name on it.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – there is not much to disagree with until one realizes that Duncan was linking to a very reasonable post from <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/11/social_security.html">Brad DeLong</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Back in 1998, 1999, and 2000 there was a deal to be struck: bring the existing Social Security system back into balance with a combination of (small) tax increases and (moderate) future benefit cuts, and supercharge it with add-on private but regulated and insured personal accounts. But neither Gingrich, Hastert, Armey, Delay, or Lott were interested in such a deal &#8211; it would give another substantive public-policy victory to Bill Clinton, you see. After 2000 Bush was interested in &#8211; well, it was never clear what Bush was interested in, for different advisors said very different things, and Bush never proposed a plan.  But the deal that was there to be struck in 1998, 1999, and 2000 is still there to be struck, if program design and decision-making can be moved out of the White House to locations with credibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Duncan was calling Gingrich, Hastert, Armey, Delay, Lott, and Bush morons – fine as they are for the privatization that he (as do I) condemns.  But Brad is not calling for carve-outs.  Brad is calling for the modest changes to either future benefits or contributions that are likely to be needed for long-run solvency.  And if individuals can be encouraged to save more for retirement through some add-on program, so much the better.  </p>
<p>We on the left – like many of those commenting to Brad’s post – should be very reluctant to deal with the Gingrich, Hastert, Armey, Delay, Lott, and Bush crowd, but we should listen to sensible conservatives such as <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/11/look-whos-talking-about-social.html">Andrew Samwick</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/11/duncan_black_no.html">Brad</a> responds to Duncan – with a touch of Rodney Dangerfield style sense of humor.  Sorry Brad – but there are too many candidates in Stupidest Man Alive contest so you don’t get to the next round.</p>

                                <p>Even though I live in Los Angeles, I rarely get that excited about either UCLA or USC football, but their game next Saturday may determine who gets to play Ohio State in the national championship.  It is no surprise that <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_11/010281.php">Kevin Drum</a> enjoyed the game last night between USC and <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/football/ncaa/11/25/notredame.usc.ap/index.html">Notre Dame</a> as USC beat the #6 ranked team nation handily.  </p>
<p>While <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&#038;id=2676062">Gene Wojciechowski</a> concedes that a USC win over UCLA will likely seal the deal, he protests:<br />
<blockquote>That&#8217;s the only real question left to answer in a season where a national championship matchup will be determined by &#8211; and how stupid is this? &#8211; &#8220;style&#8221; points. I hate the BCS. I hate it because the two best teams in the country aren&#8217;t going to play in the national title game. Instead, No. 1-ranked Ohio State is going to face a very good, but moderately flawed USC team. If it were up to me &#8212; and a slightly less-flawed Michigan team &#8211; the BCS would be swimming with the fishes. It would be ruled unconstitutional. If you uttered its initials, you would be required to eat a very large bowl of FieldTurf. So while the rest of the NCAA&#8217;s Division I-AA, II and III qualifiers are in varying stages of 16-, 24- and 32-team football playoffs, we&#8217;re stuck with BCS computer standings, mathematical formulas and a &#8220;system&#8221; so screwed up that it sees a therapist twice a week. It ought to be called the FAC (Flip A Coin).</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s we forget, Michigan beat Notre Dame by a score of 47 to 21 and its only loss was a well played game against Ohio State. While USC has beaten some very good Pac-10 teams including Berkeley, they lost to Oregon State and its margin over Notre Dame was only 44 to 24 (only?).  So Gene has a point.</p>
<p>But I’m be cheering for USC Saturday (heresy!) for this reason.  If USC plays Ohio State for the national championship, Michigan will play in the Rose Bowl.  And my hope is that their opponent will be the Berkeley Bears.  Go Bears!</p>

                                <p>I haven’t had a post about Iraq.  In general, I’ve avoided it because its generally not regarded as an economic issue, and because by the time I began blogging a few months ago, the situation had deteriorated to the point where the cheerleaders were in such denial that any discussion about Iraq inevitably would resemble the debate between a biologist and a creationist.  Rational disagreement is one thing, but just as I have no wish to waste time having a “civilized debate” with some clod who would actually write that tax receipts have doubled since 2003 (and who presumably knows that the actual figures are just sitting there on the OMB website), there was no real point in arguing with those who 3 months ago insisted that things were going swimmingly in Iraq. </p>
<p>I was born in the US, but I grew up in a (relatively mild) military dictatorship.  I also grew up next door to (and had relatives who were citizens of) somewhat more violent military dictatorships – places where the words “dirty war” meant the disappearance of tens of thousands of people, and the word “disappearance” meant death, often preceded by torture.   All that is to say – I have no problems with the concept of taking out dictators simply because it is the right thing to do, but at the same cost as what was expended taking out Saddam Hussein, quite a few dictators (some more vicious, some oppressing more people) could have been taken out.   </p>
<p>But what happens after you take out a dictatorship?  Well, clearly, even the administration admits that planning for this was poor.  Actually… it was worse than poor – I personally knew there was going to be a problem when Wolfowitz said there was no history of ethnic strife in Iraq.  I’ve never been to the Middle East, and am certainly no scholar of the region, but I knew that statement was bs.  Which meant that either one of the chief architects of the war was operating under a false (important) assumption, or he was deliberately feeding us bs about something important.  Either way, not a good sign.</p>
<p>But does the fall of a dictatorship have to be violent?  No.   I remember seeing a dictatorship fall – not from a few thousand miles away, but from right there, in the country.   The next day, it was business as usual.  Sure, the mood was different, but everyone still had to earn a living, and people still had to eat.  </p>
<p>(As an aside… In South America, the fall of various dictatorships became inevitable when the military lost the will to shoot enough people to stay in power.  The Argentine junta would still be in power in Argentina if they’d simply and without a fuss gunned down the Madres de la Plaza de Mayo – the mothers of the disappeared who marched in front of the Presidential Palace every Thursday.  In the beginning even that wouldn’t have been necessary – “disappearing” the first twenty or so of the Mothers would have ended the whole movement.  Or to use a more celebrated example – if the leaders of the Soviet coup that had arrested Gorbachev had simply shot Boris Yeltsin and the handful of supporters who rallied outside the Russian White House in the early hours after the coup, the coup would have been successful.   Think Tiananmen Square, except that none of us would have heard about that either had the Chinese authorities moved in weeks earlier.  I’m sure they’ve learned that lesson.) </p>
<p>But is violence inevitable if the fall of a dictatorship is brought about by external forces?  Then, once again, the answer is no.  If the dictatorship’s forces have been thoroughly beaten, they fight no more – and it doesn’t really matter what the enemy that beat them is like.  Germans knew that they were better being taken prisoner by the Anglo-Americans than by the Soviets, and they may have gone out of their way to surrender to the former, but when the war was over, the fighting simply stopped – on all fronts.  The myths of the werewolves and the Alpenfestung were just that – myths.  In the Pacific – a few Japanese soldiers “fought” on until as late as the 1960s and 1970s, but only because they didn’t know Japan itself had been beaten.  Those that knew ceased fighting as soon as the Emperor called for it.</p>
<p>Arguably, Iraq had not been thoroughly beaten – most Iraqi units had not even participated in any battle by the time Iraq surrendered.  But I suspect once Saddam fell, everyone had seen enough to know that if the Coalition of the Willing had been willing to utterly devastate Iraq, it could have done so.  In other words… even without the physical beating, the psychic beating had still been inflicted.</p>
<p>So what happened?  Why is there violence in Iraq?  Well… some thoughts…   While Germany and Japan surrendered completely after World War 2, there was always some amount of partisan activity in the countries that Germany and Japan had conquered.  (Granted, in most cases it was minimal, but, say, Danish or Polish resistance against the Germans existed years after Denmark and Poland surrendered, but German resistance after VE day was non-existent.)  In part, that is because the war was ongoing, and because the partisans felt their cause was just.  In other words, there was still hope for a final victory, and fighting on was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether these views make any sense to anyone who has facts at their disposal, US activities have allowed these views – that beating the US possible, and that it is the right thing to do – to take hold and to spread.    Honestly, at this point things have deteriorated so much its hard to say how to fix it.  And I wasn’t blogging at the time, so I can’t quote myself.  But I can tell you what I told friends of mine, both in person and in e-mail, at the time.  To put things in terms that GW would have understood, namely that idle hands are the devil’s workshop.  Keep people busy and they won’t have anything to do with the fanatics.  But if people unemployed, bored and desperate, you will create a lot of fanatics.</p>
<p>My prescription for a permanent victory – in the form of a peaceful, pro-Western, eventually democratic Iraq was to do the following for the first few years:</p>
<p>1.  Put every adult Iraqi to work.  Those that don’t have jobs &#8211; have them build roads and dams and any other infrastructure that is needed.  Pay them well – they’ll do a better job than foreign contractors.  And if nobody can find enough jobs to employ everyone, pay some of them dig holes, and the rest to fill those holes up.  But keep them busy and well fed, and make sure they have a stake in their own country.<br />2.  Make sure every child is also busy.  Keep them all in school.  After school… well, form soccer leagues.  Soccer balls are a cheap way to ensure nobody listens to the clerics.<br />3.  Imprison anyone – and I mean anyone, including American contractors – who break the law of the land.  Do not accept corruption even from our puppet regime.</p>
<p>(Aside number 2:  I guess none of this was an option for the folks running the show because there isn’t enough “free market” in here.  After all, that’s what all those Heritage Foundation interns went to Iraq to instill.  Of course, they didn’t believe enough in the power of the free market to let that be the determinant of whether Saddam should be in power or not.)</p>
<p>So… what do you think?  Would my simple prescription have worked?</p>

<blockquote>A sharpening slide in the US dollar unnerved global markets on Friday as investors sought to protect themselves from the possibility of sustained dollar weakness.  As US markets were closing on Friday, the euro stood at a 19-month high of $1.309, up 1.2 per cent, while sterling gained 0.9 per cent to a 1½-year peak of $1.9333. The yen climbed 0.5 per cent to ¥115.66.  European and Asian stock markets suffered the fallout from the dollar’s decline with exporters to the US the worst performing stocks in all regions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn’t it interesting that Neil Dennis, Chris Giles, and Ralph Atkins focus on foreign shareholders and not on workers?  Of course, U.S. import demand declines when the dollar devalues.  But doesn’t that spell good news for U.S. firms that export abroad?  Menzie also treat us to a paper from <a href="http://www.econ.princeton.edu/seminars/WEEKLY%20SEMINAR%20SCHEDULE/SPRING_05-06/April_24/Krugman.pdf">Paul Krugman</a> entitled “Will There Be a Dollar Crisis”, which addresses two basic questions:<br />
<blockquote>Concerns about a dollar crisis can be divided into two questions: Will there be a plunge in the dollar? Will this plunge have nasty macroeconomic consequences?</p></blockquote>
<p>Some bit of goods news from Paul as noted by Menzie:<br />
<blockquote>The dollar decline should have a net positive effect on aggregate demand via expenditure switching.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, we can avoid a recession even as we move to fiscal restraint if we allow currencies to float.</p>
