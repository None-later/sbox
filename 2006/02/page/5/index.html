                                <p>Mark Thoma and Andrew Samwick discuss problems with and potential solutions for the social safety net in this week&#8217;s<a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB113922850451565956.html"> WSJ Econoblog</a>.  They cover several important points, but following up on some posts from last week, let me highlight their discussion of the pros and cons of a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/moving-to-single-payer-system.html">single-payer health insurance system</a>.  </p>
<p>Mark Thoma argues that a single-payer system would have several advantages over market-based health insurance provision: <br />
<blockquote>The benefits of a comprehensive single-payer system covering both non-retirees and retirees begin with preventative care. Under the current system, there is little incentive for insurance companies to pay for preventative care. Instead, their incentive is to minimize costs when patients are young and relatively healthy, and then pass patients along to someone else, often the government, in later years when preventable problems become costly illnesses.</p>
<p>A second advantage is a reduction in the high overhead and administrative costs incurred by private insurance companies. </p>
<p>&#8230;A third advantage is the substantial saving that a single-payer system can realize through its bargaining power with drug and medical device suppliers. A comparison to health-care systems such as Canada&#8217;s shows such savings can be large.</p>
<p>Finally, single-payer systems offer a solution to conflict of interest problems among doctors, drug companies, and medical equipment makers that lead to an overinvestment in high cost treatments and higher medical costs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrew, on the other hand, is not a fan of the single-payer solution.  He concedes that a single-payer system would have cost advantages through increased bargaining power and lower administrative costs, but is skeptical about the other advantages to a single-payer system.  Instead, Andrew &#8220;would prefer to fix some of the obvious mistakes before making such radical changes to the [US&#8217;s health care] system.&#8221;  <br />
<blockquote>The first mistake is to make insurance voluntary when we don&#8217;t subsequently exclude those who need care from getting it at the public&#8217;s expense. We should make health insurance mandatory, but we should do so by putting the mandate on the individual, not the employer. Those who cannot provide proof of insurance on their tax returns should be charged an amount that corresponds to an insurance policy in their area. Implementing this on the tax form allows for family resources to be taken into consideration.</p>
<p>The second mistake is to allow the tax code to distort the type of insurance offered&#8230; Rather than the Bush administration&#8217;s proposal to make out-of-pocket expenses deductible via expanded medical savings accounts, I favor removing the excludability of health-insurance premiums from taxable income. This eliminates both the large tax expenditure and the distortion in the health-care market.</p>
<p>The third mistake is to force young workers to subsidize older workers in group health-insurance markets&#8230; Lowering premiums for younger workers would draw them into the insured sector and hopefully keep them there.</p></blockquote>
<p>Needless to say, I find myself squarely in the single-payer camp on this debate.  The potential savings are enormous:  better preventative care may save as much as <a href="http://www.iom.edu/CMS/3809/4660/12313/12327.aspx">$136bn</a> annually, lower administrative costs could save up to <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/IJHS_State_Paper.pdf">$300bn</a> per year, and if improved bargaining power reduced drug and medical equipment costs by just 10%, that would save perhaps $25bn-$50bn per year &#8211; with savings of perhaps $100-$200bn if we assume that a national health insurance provider could negotiate a 10% fall in overall provider prices.  </p>
<p>More importantly, however, a single-payer system would mean that everyone in the US has access to routine health care, thus improving the quality of life for millions, and would eliminate an enormous source of complexity and stress in many people&#8217;s lives &#8211; worrying about maintaining (and fighting the bureaucracy of) health insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Whether you agree or disagree with me, however, it&#8217;s worth reading this Econoblog in its entirety.  Mark and Andrew do a very nice job outlining two competing economist-prescriptions to improve the way health care is paid for in the US.</p>

                                <p>Credit goes to <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/02/gold_and_inflat.html">James Hamilton</a> for what may be the best takedown of the gold bugs over at the National Review I’ve seen yet:<br />
<blockquote>What&#8217;s behind the ongoing run-up in gold prices? One popular interpretation is that investors fear a resurgence of U.S. inflation. But that story just doesn&#8217;t square with the facts &#8230; I often hear stories along the lines of, &#8220;the bond market doesn&#8217;t expect inflation but the gold market does.&#8221; But this makes no sense. Markets are fully integrated, and there&#8217;s no reason why somebody with a particular world view wouldn&#8217;t try to grab spectacular returns wherever they might be found &#8230; We&#8217;ve seen a pretty impressive surge in commodity prices relative to other prices. But that is not quite the same thing as inflation, in which the price of a broader basket of goods and services (such as the CPI) goes up at a faster rate. If you want to claim that the current gold price reflects a fear about the latter, you have to reconcile it with the way that nominal and inflation-indexed bonds are currently priced.</p></blockquote>
<p>While taking down things like the latest from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_buzzcharts/buzzcharts200602060915.asp">Fuzzcharts</a> was not the explicit purpose of Dr. Hamilton’s post, it allowed me to skip reacting to the following nonsense:<br />
<blockquote>While many credit Greenspan for the booming economy of the late 1990s, his term should be evaluated on how well he fulfilled his core duty: maintaining the value of the dollar. When judged against that goal, the Maestro’s record is mixed. The CRB Spot Index is an inflation index based on 22 commodities and prepared daily by the Commodity Research Bureau. As the chart above shows, former Fed chairs Arthur Burns and G. William Miller both tried (and failed) to fight the pervasive inflation of the 1970s. Paul Volcker, who took over at the Fed in 1979, put an end to it in the early 1980s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jerry Bowyer is not qualified to grade the Greenspan FED – so I’m deferring to the views of economists such as James Hamilton.</p>

<blockquote><p>The hearing began with a sudden and sharp partisan dispute when Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Arlen Specter ruled that Gonzales did not have to be sworn in to testify. After Democrats strongly objected and demanded a roll-call vote, Republicans prevailed and the attorney general did not testify under oath.</p></blockquote>
<p>Before one asks why not, let’s see what he has been reported to have said to the Senate committee:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The terrorist surveillance program is necessary, it is lawful and it respects the civil liberties we all cherish,&#8221; Gonzales said &#8230; Gonzales told the committee that the program is limited to communication between someone in the U.S. and someone in a foreign nation; triggered when a NSA professional beliefs one of the parties is tied to al Qaeda &#8230; Gonzales responded that he was asked whether the president could authorize surveillance that violated law. &#8220;That has not occurred&#8221;, he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>My question sort of answers itself – it would not be prudent for the Attorney General to have lied under oath, would it?</p>

<p>Menzie writes:<br />
<blockquote>By December 2004, payroll employment was -76,000 less than in January 2001. Both the payroll employment series, and the household survey based employment series adjusted to conform to the establishment survey coverage, are plotted in the figure below … Not only has employment growth been unnaturally low in this recovery, it has been &#8211; and remains &#8211; low relative to even the post-1991 recovery, which was itself marked by slow job creation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Put another way – payroll employment as of January 2005 was the same as it was as of January 2001, that is, zero growth during Bush’s first term.  While it is true that we have had better decent growth over the past year, the cumulative growth during the first five years of this century has been very low for such a time span.</p>

                                <p>In the spirit of Brad DeLong&#8217;s <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/teaching_spring_2006/">course on economics reporting</a>, I noticed this morning that Joel Havemann of the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-budget6feb06,0,4647679.story?coll=la-home-nation">LA Times</a> does a reasonably good job providing some context against which to measure the Bush administration&#8217;s budget rhetoric:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Bush Budget Plan Strikes Home, Not Deficit</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Bush today will propose a $2.7-trillion budget that would take another slice out of domestic spending next year — but still leave a huge $355-billion deficit.</p>
<p>In Bush&#8217;s budget for fiscal year 2007, which begins Oct. 1, the departments of Defense and Homeland Security would continue to grow at a rate greater than inflation.</p>
<p>But most other federal departments, from Agriculture to Veterans Affairs, will be asked to get along next year with less money, and with no allowance for inflation or population growth.</p>
<p>Altogether, Bush&#8217;s budget would save $14.5 billion next year by eliminating or sharply curtailing 141 federal programs — fulfilling his vow in last week&#8217;s State of the Union address to reduce the costs of what he called &#8220;non-security discretionary spending.&#8221;</p>
<p>Broken down, those range from a relatively small nick in Medicare&#8217;s enormous growth to the virtual elimination of a small program that distributes food to the elderly.</p></blockquote>
<p>The things that Havemann&#8217;s article could have done better are: 1) providing a bit more context to illustrate that the $14.5 billion cut from some discretionary programs, while a lot of money to the programs being cut, is peanuts compared to the huge numbers in the defense budget, entitlements, and the deficit; and 2) pointing out that while the Bush budget does show a halving of the deficit as a percent of GDP by 2009 (though not in dollar terms), the administration&#8217;s <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/pdf/overview-06.pdf">budget document</a> showing this fall is suspiciously vague about the assumptions it incorporates regarding spending in Iraq and Afghanistan, future tax cuts, and AMT relief.  All of these major factors affecting the budget are frequently excluded from Bush administration budget forecasts whenever they are inconvenient to their rhetorical goals.</p>
<p>Those quibbles aside, this is a pretty good piece of reporting, and overall the LA Times continues to generally provide better reporting on the budget and economic issues than you will see from most major news outlets.</p>

<blockquote>Including revisions, January employment is a huge 317,000 above the initial December level.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/02/latest_employme_1.html">James Hamilton</a> reads this sentence and writes:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;m not quite sure where Larry is getting this 317,000 figure, but I am inclined not to make too much of the data revisions. As the table on the right reveals, the revised figures released yesterday show 140,000 new jobs in December, rather than the 108,000 December job growth figure that was reported on January 6.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s go to page 6 of the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Employment Situation Summary</a> that discusses revisions to establishment survey data:</p>
<blockquote><p>In accordance with annual practice, the establishment survey data have been revised to reflect comprehensive universe counts of payroll jobs, or benchmarks. These counts are derived principally from unemployment insurance tax records for March 2005.  As a result of the benchmark process, all not seasonally adjusted data series were subject to revision from April 2004 forward, the time period since the last benchmark was established.  In addition, with this release, the seasonally adjusted establishment survey data from January 2001 forward were subject to revision due to the introduction of updated seasonal adjustment factors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Had these revisions increased reported employment by something on the order of 93,000, then perhaps we might understand how Mr. Kudlow came up with his 317,000 figure.  Now any reasonable person would say such playing games with numbers is rubbish, but note Kudlow loves to report the change in the reported household survey figures – never acknowledging the footnotes, which state “data affected by changes in population controls in January 2000, January 2003, January 2004, January 2005, and January 2006”.  To illustrate how dishonest Kudlow et al. are being, let’s consider the following chart of the reported household survey figure from October 2002 to September 2003 – a period in which the employment to population ratio declined from 62.7% to 62%.  Yet, the reported employment number appears to be higher on September 2003 than it was on October 2002 because of the jump in reported employment from December 2002 to January 2003.  This jump occurred not because the employment to population ratio jumped.  Rather it is related to the “changes in population controls in January 2003”.  </p>

<p>Kudlow got the sign wrong per the recent revision in the payroll survey.  Table C shows the December figure “as previously published” to be 134,468,000 as compared to the revised figure of 134,371,000.  Now if some pessimist wished to be as dishonest as Kudlow has been in the past, he could not that the January 2006 figure of 134,564,000 is only 96,000 greater than the 134.468,000 December figure “as previously published”.  But let’s not go down this dishonest path – January did see an increase in employment that was indeed almost 200,000, which was neither as explosive as Kudlow had claimed nor as small as his inappropriate reporting technique (done right) would have implied.  The following graph shows reported employment from July 2005 to December 2005 “as previously published” as well as the current reporting from July 2005 to January 2006.</p>

<p>No wonder Dr. Hamilton was confused by Kudlow’s Kalculation – as Kudlow once again fails to tell his readers what he has done and this time fails to double check his math.</p>

                                <p>So asks <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200602031604.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> who writes:<br />
<blockquote>Economic pessimists have had a field day ever since GDP was reported a week ago at only 1.1 percent for the fourth quarter. But the latest jobs report released on Friday blew them out of the water. Including revisions, January employment is a huge 317,000 above the initial December level. In fact, over the past three months, non-farm payrolls have increased an average 229,000 per month. That’s explosive … As soon as the breakout employment news was released, Salesman-in-Chief George W. Bush should have been in the Rose Garden giving it air time. He should have declared that jobs have continued to grow big time while the unemployment rate has fallen &#8211; all the way down to 4.7 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be fair to Mr. Kudlow, I was hoping someone would bring up as I was eager to bring up an old point about the labor force participation rate and I see that <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2006/02/payroll_employm.html">William Polley</a> has already weighed in.  The point starts with the identity that the unemployment rate is simply one minus (the employment-population ratio/the labor force participation rate).  </p>
<p>Let’s go back to December 2000 (just before George Bush took office) and remember that the employment-population ratio was 64.4%, while the labor force participation rate was 67.0% &#8211; which translated into a 3.9% unemployment rate.  Economic growth, however, was dreadfully slow from early 2001 to September 2003, which translated into an employment-population ratio of only 62.1%.  The unemployment rate, however, only rose to 6.2% as the labor force participation rate had declined to 66.1%.  From September 2003 to January 2006, the recovery in the labor market has not been explosive but has been sufficient to let the employment-population ratio inch back up to 62.9%.  Alas, the labor force participation rate is 66.0%, which is lower than where it was as of September 2003.  Leave to Mr. Kudlow to cheer about falling unemployment as a result of fewer people being officially counted in the labor force.</p>
<p>Even as Dr. Polley notes that whether it is reasonable to expect the labor force participation rate to rise, let’s consider what the implications of a 62.9% employment-population ratio would be if the labor force participation rate were currently at 67%.  Wow – the unemployment rate would be 6.1%.  Even if we split the difference and assumed a 66.5% labor force participation rate with the present employment-population ratio, we’d be talking about a 5.4% unemployment rate.</p>
<p>But beyond these simple realities, there may be another reason President Bush does not wish to join Kudlow’s cheerleading.  I bet that President Bush – like Mr. Kudlow – is hoping for another pander to the voters style free lunch tax cut – and if one claimed we were at full employment, the logic behind advocating even more fiscal stimulus would simply be too stupid for even this White House.  But not to NRO Financial.</p>

                                <p>Apparently, Donald Marron testified to the Senate Budget Committee yesterday &#8211; and if the account I’m being told is true, I have a lot more respect for Senator Judd Gregg (Republican-New Hampshire) than I do for Mr. Marron.  From a Tax Analyst account of the testimony:<br />
<blockquote>Marron told the committee that the February 1 passage of a budget reconciliation bill in the House would chip about $5 billion from this year’s estimated $337 billion federal budget deficit. Other than that, Marron’s testimony was consistent with the themes he has echoed since the January 26 release of the latest CBO outlook: Over the next 10 years the deficit is projected to improve, the economy should remain strong, and challenges from entitlement programs loom. Marron said those themes and projections assume that mandatory spending programs will continue, that discretionary spending will grow at the rate of inflation, and that tax law will stay as is.  In other words, said Budget Committee Chair Judd Gregg, R-N.H., the CBO’s baseline “takes into account things that probably aren’t going to happen.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Kent Conrad (Democrat-North Dakota) also got in an important objection to Mr. Marron’s testimony:<br />
<blockquote>Conrad dismissed the argument that the president’s tax cuts on capital gains and dividends would generate enough economic growth to offset the revenue loss they cause.  Marron agreed: “Pro-growth tax cuts &#8211; reducing marginal rates, things that are focused on savings and investment &#8211; do help the economy grow, and therefore you get back something from that economic behavior that a purely static estimate wouldn’t account for. But the scenarios being considered do not come close to actually paying for themselves.”</p></blockquote>
<p>What does President Bush continue to say?  Oh yea, we need to give people their money back so they can CONSUME more.  Which means national savings decline (yes, I’m assuming that this Congress will continue to only pretend to cut spending).  So how does the acting director of the CBO get away with claiming that savings and investment will increase?</p>

Donohue and Justin Wolfers</a> questions the empirical evidence purporting to show that capital punishment deters murder:<br />
<blockquote>Does the death penalty save lives? A surge of recent interest in this question has yielded a series of papers purporting to show robust and precise estimates of a substantial deterrent effect of capital punishment. We assess the various approaches that have been used in this literature, testing the robustness of these inferences. Specifically, we start by assessing the time series evidence, comparing the history of executions and homicides in the United States and Canada, and within the United States, between executing and non-executing states. We analyze the effects of the judicial experiments provided by the Furman and Gregg decisions and assess the relationship between execution and homicide rates in state panel data since 1934. We then revisit the existing instrumental variables approaches and assess two recent state-specific execution morartoria. In each case we find that previous inferences of large deterrent effects based upon specific examples, functional forms, control variables, comparison groups, or IV strategies are extremely fragile and even small changes in the specifications yield dramatically different results. The fundamental difficulty is that the death penalty &#8212; at least as it has been implemented in the United States &#8212; is applied so rarely that the number of homicides that it can plausibly have caused or deterred cannot be reliably disentangled from the large year-to-year changes in the homicide rate caused by other factors. As such, short samples and particular specifications may yield large but spurious correlations. We conclude that existing estimates appear to reflect a small and unrepresentative sample of the estimates that arise from alternative approaches. Sampling from the broader universe of plausible approaches suggests not just &#8220;reasonable doubt&#8221; about whether there is any deterrent effect of the death penalty, but profound uncertainty &#8211; even about its sign.</p></blockquote>
<p>Their abstract reminds me of an argument in Edward Leamer’s  <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8282(198303)73%3A1%3C31%3ALTTCOO%3E2.0.CO%3B2-R"> Let&#8217;s Take the Con Out of Econometrics</a>.  For more discussion on whether capital punishment deters murder, see the testimony of <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/FaganTestimony.pdf">Jeffrey Fagan</a>.</p>
<p>Confession – I’m opposed to capital punishment in part because I’ve yet to be convinced that the evidence shows any deterrent value.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This morning the BLS released its estimate of net new job creation in Janaury.  Including upward revisions in the new job estimates for the previous few months, it was <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">a pretty good report</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Nonfarm payroll employment increased by 193,000 in January, and the unemployment rate fell to 4.7 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Job gains occurred in several industries, including construction, mining, food services and drinking places, health care, and financial activities.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, construction employment still seems to be growing robustly, despite some concerns that the real estate market is cooling off; 46,000 of the new jobs created last month were in construction.</p>
<p>Taking a look at the industry shares of employment gains over the past year illustrates that construction has regularly accounted for nearly one out of five new jobs in the US economy.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/sector_jobs3.jpg"></p>
<p>In percentage terms the growth rate of jobs in the construction sector was higher than for [almost] any other industry in 2005, as the following table shows (job growth in thousands, wage in $/hour).</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/sector_jobs4.jpg"></p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, all of this confirms what we already knew: the US economy is steadily shifting away from producing tradeable goods, toward producing non-tradeable goods.  And that underlies most of the concern many people have about how painful an adjustment in the US&#8217;s current account deficit might someday be.</p>

<p>UPDATE: Errors on chart and table fixed.</p>
