                                <p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2148486">Mickey Kaus</a> gets around to responding to <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/09/why_oh_why_cant_1.html">Brad DeLong</a> and has a lot more to say.  Let’s start with something that will disappoint a certain troll:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Roland Patrick&#8221; comes up with similar good news” in answer to DeLong. I&#8217;m skeptical, however, of arguments that claim the poverty rate isn’t even a useful measure because it &#8220;moves in the wrong direction on good [economic] news.&#8221; It looks to me like it moves in the right direction, but after a lag.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alas, he follows this wisdom with:<br />
<blockquote>But I&#8217;d love to see a poverty rate that makes two obvious corrections: 1) Don&#8217;t count the millions of new immigrants who come to this country poor and swell the poverty numbers simply because they have yet to move up the ladder. What&#8217;s the poverty rate in 2005 for those families that were here in 2000? Compare it with the rate in 2004 for families here in 1999, etc. &#8230; 2) Don&#8217;t count affluent people who, by reason of their affluence, are able to take off a year with no income and therefore show up as &#8220;poor&#8221; in the income stats.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_09/009443.php">Kevin Drum</a> has some fun with 2).  In his reply to Brad DeLong, Mickey Kaus writes:<br />
<blockquote>If there&#8217;s good news, I assume it would be mainly that the poverty rate &#8211; and the &#8220;extreme poverty&#8221; rate &#8211; seem to have peaked, after the 2000 recession, at a lower level than they peaked after the previous recession … That&#8217;s a good thing, no? On the other hand, poverty hasn&#8217;t yet fallen to the low level achieved at the end of the Clinton boom/bubble. &#8230; Will the rate continue to fall? Has it maybe become less volatile &#8211; less sensitive to both busts and booms? Only time will tell! &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>There WAS good news during the late 1990’s.  The bad news is that the Bush recovery has not brought us back to those lower levels.  But to be fair, maybe there will be a lagged effect – only time will tell.  But then Mickey Kaus really gets nutty:<br />
<blockquote>But I would think Democrats &#8211; especially Clintonite Democrats, should resist bogus bad news, like the left&#8217;s spin on the &#8220;deep poverty&#8221; number, a number that was suddenly emphasized by opponents of Clinton&#8217;s welfare reform when, after that law&#8217;s passage, the regular old poverty numbers failed to soar as predicted. The &#8220;deep poverty&#8221; number didn&#8217;t soar either, so leftish organizations like Robert Greenstein&#8217;s Center on Budget and Policy Priorities moved on to noting that &#8220;deep poverty&#8221; increased (slightly) as a percentage of all poverty &#8211; a completely confected statistic that we shouldn&#8217;t really care about.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure what Robert Greenstein meant by “soar” (or even if he used that particular term) but the fact is that the extreme poverty rate was 5.4% in 2005 versus 4.5% in 2000.  Also the official poverty rate in 2005 was higher than it was in 2000.  We are hearing from the likes of Mickey Kaus that welfare reform worked – even though the evidence suggests poverty is higher now than it was before the Bush recession/recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/09/im_not_going_ba.html">Brad DeLong</a> makes a very good decision:<br />
<blockquote>Some correspondents are asking me to go back to [Slate].  They don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re asking. You don&#8217;t know what it&#8217;s like over there. I can&#8217;t go back. I can&#8217;t. Please don&#8217;t make me.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even as he wisely refuses to read Kaus, he makes an interesting point:<br />
<blockquote>Yep. Rich people who don&#8217;t work, so they don&#8217;t have any earned income; don&#8217;t have pensions and Social Security; don&#8217;t own property, so they don&#8217;t have any rental income; don&#8217;t own stocks, so they don&#8217;t have any dividend income; they don&#8217;t have any oil wells or literary properties, so they don&#8217;t have any royalty income; and don&#8217;t own bonds or have bank accounts, so they don&#8217;t have any interest income. Rich people without any earned income, pension income, Social Security income, rental income, royalty income, dividend income, or interest income. But they are &#8220;affluent.&#8221; There are sure a lot of them. Why, I run into thousands every day. At Safeway.</p></blockquote>
<p>The point being that the best way to address a dopey argument is to mock it!</p>

                                <p>As a follow-up to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/mismeasure-of-poverty.html">this discussion</a>, we should note <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/01/AR2006090101409.html">Eberstadt</a> gets a little Washington Post space:<br />
<blockquote>The percentage of people falling below that threshold was deemed the &#8220;poverty rate.&#8221; The threshold is adjusted each year to take into account changing prices. But much more than prices has changed since 1965 &#8211; and the government&#8217;s poverty measures have failed to adapt to and recognize the new conditions. With more access to credit, greater income swings from year to year, and improved nutrition, housing and health care, the life of America&#8217;s poor is radically different today. Unless the nation&#8217;s basic poverty indicators take into account such new conditions, any efforts to effectively redress poverty in America are bound to fail.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max calls this <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002482.html">dopey</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The fundamental value of the measure is to compare different points in time, not to provide a scientific assessment of deprivation at any point in time. Criticizing it in this dimension is idiotic.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max tackles several of the details of Eberstadt’s writings, including this gem:</p>
<blockquote><p>NE&#8217;s own suggestions on data are laughable. He invokes levels of per capita income, high school graduation, the unemployment rate, and total public spending on the poor. The relation of any of these to the poverty rate could be ably disentangled by a smart college student, so I will pass on the details.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Max only alludes to the CPI bias argument, he and Dean Baker have also noted that the cost of health care has increased, while any advantages from things like fancy cars with GPS don’t matter too much to the poor.  And catch how Max ends his devastating critique:</p>
<blockquote><p>Eberstadt really wants a measure of the distribution of consumption over time, the better to analyze changes in the standard of living. But he provides no such measurement nor alludes to any in his column. Maybe he&#8217;s not a data person. For the story, you need to consult two organizations not included in the Post&#8217;s &#8220;Think Tank Town&#8221; stable, EPI and CEPR who have done quite a bit in this realm.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am delighted to point AB readers to Max’s blog and the writing of EPI and CEPR.  And my apologies in advance to Max if our troll makes a pest of himself in Max’s comment box.</p>
<p>Update: Jonah Goldberg is busy proving he knows nothing about poverty either.  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODUwNDU3MzVhYmRmYTgxYWZjYTdkYTBjMmFmNzQ5Y2I=">One post</a> praises the garbage from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/mickey-kaus-finds-good-poverty-news.html">Mickey Kaus</a>.</p>
<p>The other salutes one of his know-nothing <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTJkMTYyYzc5Y2Y2N2EwNTlhMjE4ODlhYjNlNzJhODA=">readers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>don&#8217;t see it mentioned very often in poverty rate discussions but it seems to me that when you consider the fact that the US absorbs millions of desperately poor immigrants every year, it&#8217;s really amazing that the poverty rate isn&#8217;t much higher than it is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clueless and lazy Jonah declares this to be an excellent point without taking the effort to check any facts.  So I did.  The <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/histpov/hstpov3.html">Census Bureau</a> breaks out poverty rates over time among ages as well as race.  Forgive me as I delve into the race side of this, but low expectations Jonah has already taken us there.  Let’s see – while Asians have lower poverty rates than African Americans, but it is true that Hispanics have higher poverty rates than whites.  I guess Jonah only focuses on Hispanic and not Asian immigrants.  Of course, the historical trends are color blind with poverty rising for all groups including whites.  Maybe Jonah is still blaming us Irish.  </p>
<p>We also could look at poverty rates by <a href="http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/pov/new46_100125_09.htm">state</a>.  My state (California) has a poverty rate just over the national average with Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas also having poverty rates about the national average.  But check red states such as Georgia, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Carolina where their poverty rates are higher than California’s.  Can immigration be blamed for that? </p>
<p>Why does Mr. Goldberg get to draw a salary for his lazy serial stupidity?  I can’t believe there is anyone on the planet dumb enough to think he ever has any insights on anything.</p>

                                <p>Bob Casey made a fool out of Rick Santorum during the national security portion of their debate on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14568263">Meet the Press</a> (even if Philly’s own <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_09_03_atrios_archive.html#115729472021739800">Duncan Black </a> was not impressed).  Given that Casey believes in fiscal responsibility, the second half of the debate would have gone in his favor except for the fact that the fool named Tim Russert was moderating.  One had to know how idiotic Russert would be as soon as he started using the unified budget rather than the General Fund deficit as his metric.  After Casey promised to repeal some of Bush’s tax cuts, we got this:<br />
<blockquote>MR. RUSSERT: Over 10 years.<br />MR. CASEY: Over 10 years, that’s right.<br />MR. RUSSERT: Yeah, but, but if you rolled back the top 1 percent, it’s about $56 billion in a year. Our deficit is 200&#8230;<br />MR. CASEY: That’s true, Tim, absolutely.<br />MR. RUSSERT: How you going to balance the budget? Which, which programs you going to cut?<br />MR. CASEY: Tim, you can’t, you can’t balance a budget in one year. They’ve put us in such a fiscal hole, it will take many years. I hope it doesn’t take 10 years, it took&#8230;<br />MR. RUSSERT: Well, but give me a couple ideas. Which programs would you cut?</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, that’s a fair question that Casey tried to answer.  Alas, Russert did not hammer Santorum in the same way as he let Santorum get away with the usual GOP garbage of saying the Democrat has no plan, the Democrat’s plan (which of course does not exist) lacks specifics, and the specifics of the Democrat’s plan (which again does not exist) would somehow be bad for the economy.  And then we get this bait-and-switch:</p>
<blockquote><p>SEN. SANTORUM: Well, let me just say this. First up, I don’t know how Mr.  Casey by, by, by changing the, the estate tax to provide more exemptions is going to save money. The fact of the matter is that that would cost money over, over the long term, not, not save money. The death tax snaps back to the old death tax in 2011, and if he made changes, it would cost, literally, hundreds of millions &#8211; probably $100 million just to do the changes that he suggested. So it doesn’t save money, it costs money. But that’s OK because I’m for not, not taking more people’s money when, when they die. So maybe we, maybe we agree on that. Although he said he would have voted against any changes to, to lower the death tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>Casey’s numbers were how his middle ground position would compare to Bush’s position for a complete elimination of the Estate Tax, while Santorum’s metric was comparing Casey’s position to a return to the tax rates during the 1990’s.  Last I heard – Santorum was in favor of Bush’s position.  In fact, he offered no specifics on either spending cuts or reversals of Bush’s tax cuts.  All Santorum did was to repeat two examples of free lunch supply-side spin such as:</p>
<blockquote><p>SEN. SANTORUM: He wants to, he, he wants to grow the economy by increasing taxes. That’s what he says. So here, here he’s saying we have to grow the economy so we’re going to take more out of it. That’s a great way to grow the economy. In fact, what we’ve seen is that, in fact, when we give people their money, let them keep the money that they’ve worked hard to earn, they reinvest it, they create jobs, and they grow the economy just like you suggested. He provided absolutely no answer, again.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see – giving people their money back so they can consume more.  Of course, this means less national savings and hence less investment and long-term growth.  Don’t believe me.  This is also the view of Bush’s first two CEA chairs: Glenn Hubbard and Greg Mankiw.  Andy why not?  During the fiscally responsible era from the end of World War II to 1980, we average annual real GDP growth of 3.5%.  We were told that the 1981 tax cut would lead to more growth but the reduction in national savings led to an average annual growth rate of only 3.0% over the next 12 years.  We were told that the 1993 tax increase would cut growth but the Clinton years saw average annual growth rates of 3.7%.  The Bush43 years so far?  Average annual growth rates have been only 2.6%.  As Russert pretends he understands these issues, he can’t ask Santorum a follow-up question?  </p>
<p>But it got much worse when Russert turned to Social Security (calling <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/">Bob Somereby</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Social Security and Medicare and other entitlements make up 52 percent of our federal spending. It dwarfs defense and non-defense and interest on the public debt. There are 40 million people on Social Security and Medicare.  There’s going to be 80 million in the next 15 years. Life expectancy is &#8211; used to be 65, it’s now approaching 80 &#8230; So, so double the people on Social Security and Medicare, and life expectancy approaches 80, and the solution is do nothing? &#8230; You didn’t have a baby boom, you didn’t have a baby boom generation in retiring.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ve call for the producers of Meet the Press to fire Russert – and if they are not willing to do that, to order Russert to learn something about the Social Security issue or cease his incessant babbling about it.  And why couldn’t he follow-up on this:</p>
<blockquote><p>stop the raid introduced by Jim DeMint which says take the surplus that’s coming in right now and actually put it into individual accounts so people have ownership of this surplus instead of the money being taken and raided to pay for, for current government expenditures. So number two is to stop the raid, give people their own personal accounts that, that will actually be there to pay for them down the road. And number three, give younger workers the opportunity to have personal retirement accounts. Those personal retirement accounts will grow faster and produce more than what the government, “investment in Social Security,” thus making up the difference between the two.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone explain to me what the difference is between Gore’s “lock box” and DeMint’s “stop the raid”.  At least, Al Gore wanted to find someway to reverse the General Fund deficit fiasco whereas DeMint and Santorum can neither find a single tax increase or spending cut that they will support.  As far as the “personal retirement accounts will grow faster”, we have addressed this piece of financial mendacity many times including <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/privatization-becker-v-snow-dead.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/two-conservative-economists-question.html">here</a>.  Maybe Santorum believes the free lunch lies that the Cato Institute told George W. Bush back in 1998.  If so, he is too stupid to trust with our long-run fiscal policy.</p>

                                <p>Be patient with the <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OGNmNmI1OWFjZWQ5NTJiODRhYjM5YjUwZWZlYjI3ZDg=">following point/counterpoint</a> as it comes from two of Karl Rove’s favorite excuse makers: Cliff May reporting on something Brit Hume said.  </p>
<blockquote><p>I know I keep making the same point over and over re the Plame/Wilson case. I can’t help myself. On Fox just now, Brit Hume said that the only significant leak was Dick Armitage’s leak to Bob Novak, which led Novak to write that Valerie Plame was a CIA operative. But Armitage did not tell Novak (and Novak did not believe or write) that Plame had undercover status. Both thought (as did others around town) that Plame was simply a CIA analyst working in an office at CIA HQ in Langley &#8211; which indeed she was. So the one other significant leak was the fact that Plame was (or had been) a NOC, an agent with Non-Official Cover.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sentence 2 was false, but sentence 3 pointed this out.  Sentence 4 is one of Cliff’s often repeated lies, but sentence 5 pointed this out.  The rest of this is simply one lie after another:</p>
<blockquote><p>Who first revealed that? David Corn did. What was his source? It was almost certainly Joe Wilson himself.  So there were two significant leaks: one by Armitage to Novak, one by – presumably &#8211; Wilson to Corn. (No significant leaks came from Rove, Libby or others at the White House.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Corn’s article ran on July 16, 2003 and even Cliff has said we knew Valerie Plame was a NOC as of July 14, 2003.  But I’m being rude by ignoring Cliff’s question:</p>
<blockquote><p>AM I BECOMING A BORE ON THIS?</p></blockquote>
<p>YES!</p>
<p>Footnte on the Rustman Rouse: This is truly funny.  Rightwingers (as in our troll) who wish to claim Valerie Plame was not a NOC are pointing to the <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20050715-121257-9887r.htm">July 15, 2005</a> piece from the rightwing rag known as the Washington Times:</p>
<blockquote><p>A former CIA covert agent who supervised Mrs. Plame early in her career yesterday took issue with her identification as an &#8220;undercover agent,&#8221; saying that she worked for more than five years at the agency&#8217;s headquarters in Langley and that most of her neighbors and friends knew that she was a CIA employee. &#8220;She made no bones about the fact that she was an agency employee and her husband was a diplomat,&#8221; Fred Rustmann, a covert agent from 1966 to 1990, told The Washington Times. &#8220;Her neighbors knew this, her friends knew this, his friends knew this. A lot of blame could be put on to central cover staff and the agency because they weren&#8217;t minding the store here. &#8230; The agency never changed her cover status.&#8221; Mr. Rustmann, who spent 20 of his 24 years in the agency under &#8220;nonofficial cover&#8221; &#8211; also known as a NOC, the same status as the wife of Mr. Wilson &#8211; also said that she worked under extremely light cover. In addition, Mrs. Plame hadn&#8217;t been out as an NOC since 1997, when she returned from her last assignment, married Mr. Wilson and had twins, USA Today reported yesterday. The distinction matters because a law that forbids disclosing the name of undercover CIA operatives applies to agents that had been on overseas assignment &#8220;within the last five years.&#8221; &#8220;She was home for such a long time, she went to work every day at Langley, she was in an analytical type job, she was married to a high-profile diplomat with two kids,&#8221; Mr. Rustmann said. &#8220;Most people who knew Valerie and her husband, I think, would have thought that she was an overt CIA employee.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow – her supervisory?  But what did Rustman say?  First of all, he never talked to the neighbors of Joseph Wilson and his lovely wife Valerie.  He was her supervisor up to 1990 when she clearly was a NOC.  No one denies she was a NOC at least for another seven years AFTER Mr. Rustman left the agency.  This is the basis of the rightwing’s excuse that Valerie Plame was not an undercover agent?</p>

                                <p>is the title of a series of papers editted by <a href="http://www.brook.edu/press/books/new_world_of_welfare.htm">Rebecca Blank and Ron Haskins</a> and was published in 2001 by the Brookings Institute:<br />
<blockquote>The need for reauthorization presents an opportunity to assess what welfare reform has accomplished and what remains to be done. The New World of Welfare is an attempt to frame the policy debate for reauthorization, and to inform the policy discussion among the states and at the federal level, especially by drawing lessons from research on the effects of welfare reform. In the book, a diverse set of welfare experts—liberal and conservative, academic and nonacademic—engage in rigorous debate on topics ranging from work experience programs, to job availability, to child well-being, to family formation. In order to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of research on welfare reform, the contributors cover subjects including work and wages, effects of reform on family income and poverty, the politics of conservative welfare reform, sanctions and time limits, financial work incentives for low-wage earners, the use of medicaid and food stamps, welfare-to-work, child support, child care, and welfare reform and immigration &#8230; Rebecca M. Blank is dean of the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy at the University of Michigan. She was senior staff economist with the Council of Economic Advisers during the first Bush administration and was appointed to the council under President Clinton. Ron Haskins is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a senior consultant at the Annie E. Casey Foundation.</p></blockquote>
<p>The AB comment box has been occasionally graced with contributions from Dr. Blank, which is truly an honor.  When I posted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/welfare-deform-now-why-didnt-i-say.html">this</a>, one comment directed us to the recent testimony of <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/views/testimony/haskins/20060719.pdf">Ron Haskins</a>. Haskins talks about lower caseloads, which could be due less to the premise that welfare reform is working and more to the possibility that time limits are just tossing people deeper into poverty.  Yes, poverty is lower today than it was in 1996 – but it has been rising.  Haskins, however, does gather evidence as the employment and earnings of female-headed households.  Again, we saw improvements during the boom during the late 1990’s with some recent reversals.  </p>
<p><a href="http://urbanpolicy.berkeley.edu/pdf/Ch2Blank0404.pdf">Dr. Blank</a> asks What Did the 1990s Welfare Reform Accomplish? I cannot do justice to Dr. Blank’s paper in a single post, so I’ll simply focus on a couple of points.  First welfare reform neither began nor ended with the 1996 act and it would be a mistake to think that Congress had some simple monolithic welfare to work mandate:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since the Reagan administration, there has been a growing interest in providing welfare recipients with the assistance and the incentives to move rapidly off welfare into employment. Experiments with welfare-to-work programs started in the 1980s. These experiments became more dramatic in the early 1990s under the Clinton Administration … The 1996 passage of PRWORA enacted federal changes to cash assistance programs. Most notably, it abolished AFDC and in its place Congress created the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) block grant. This had two major effects. First, it gave states much more discretion over program design &#8230; Second, TANF provides funds to state programs as a block grant, whereas AFDC was funded through a matching grant &#8230; In addition to the creation of the TANF block grant, the PRWORA legislation had a number of other provisions that limited the availability of cash assistance and increased the incentives for low-income families to move into work … PRWORA also enacted time limits, limiting an individual’s ability to receive TANF-funded assistance to 60 months &#8230; Finally, a variety of PRWORA provisions limited access to income assistance programs among target groups. Immigrant access to TANF was restricted, as well as to food stamps and Medicaid.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice that we had been experimenting with different structures before 1996 and the 1996 act gave states more flexibility to experiment.  The second point I’d like to focus on is noted here:<br />
<blockquote>Policy changes weren’t the only news in the last half of the 1990s. While the economy grew slowly coming out of the recession of 1990-91, starting in 1995 the U.S. entered a period of sustained high growth, rising productivity, and low unemployment. By the time the expansion ended in 2001, it had become the longest period of continuous economic growth in U.S. history. The effect of this expansion was particularly noticeable for less-skilled workers. Despite a consensus view in the early 1990s that the expected long-term unemployment rate in the United States was between 5.5 or 6 percent, unemployment remained at or below 5 percent from April 1997 through October 2001. Even among adult high school dropouts &#8211; whose unemployment rates were in the double digits in the early 1990s &#8211; unemployment fell to less than 7 percent. Wages also rose throughout the wage distribution. This was particularly good news for less-skilled (and especially male) workers, who had experienced substantial wage declines for 15 years starting around 1979. Although the wage increases after 1995 did not make up all of the ground lost in the previous two decades, they clearly increased the economic returns to work. The result of this economic boom was a job-rich economy that offered more job availability and better wages to low-skilled workers than at any time in the previous two or three decades. This allowed states to largely ignore job availability concerns as they<br />redesigned their welfare-to-work programs and encouraged a growing number of welfare recipients to seek work. States could focus on program design and implementation for their new TANF-funded programs &#8230; The economic slowdown of the early 2000s is clearly visible in these data, combined with the effects of a steady caseload decline. The likelihood of moving into work, conditional on receiving welfare in the previous year, declines in 2001 and 2002 (although it rises again in 2003). In part this reflects higher unemployment rates and a more sluggish economy. In part it reflects the fact that the group of women who report public assistance income in each year is shrinking over time, creating a progressively smaller and more selected base sample.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have heard from a bunch of know-nothings who cannot make up their minds whether poverty moves inversely with the business cycle.  While I don’t pretend to be an expert on this topic, Dr. Blank certainly is.  And she recognizes that efforts to reduce poverty work best when the economy is growing and its growth is shared across income groups.</p>

                                <p>At first, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjcwYWE5NGM3Y2E2ZDc4OTNmYTZiMzM0MmUwZmZiNTE=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> was making sense:<br />
<blockquote>People on the right, like me, want to win the war, but the president is not unveiling a truly new victory plan. His own Pentagon just issued a gloomy Iraq report that chronicles near-civil-war sectarian violence and the security problems in that country. Voter opinions have already hardened on Iraq, and it is doubtful that the commander in chief is going to change any of this in the next 60 or so days. It may well be that things have improved in the Sunni Triangle in the last month, with 12,000 additional U.S. troops and something of a standoff with al Sadr and his army. But this will not resonate for the election.  It is too late to make this sale. Instead, the president should be hammering away on homeland-security measures to protect against another terrorist attack.</p></blockquote>
<p>This Administration has botched Iraq.  Alas, this Administration has been doing little about homeland security except for the kind of rhetoric that follows:<br />
<blockquote>This is where the Republican party has true value-added. Defense against terrorist bombings should be made into a wedge issue for this election. There will be critical votes in Congress on the Patriot Act and FISA-related issues concerning electronic surveillance … The ACLU Democrats will keep carping about chemical plants, bridges, and tunnels. And Republicans must counter with highly publicized votes on surveillance expansion. This is what stopped the terrorists in the London plot. Folks know this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, we know the UK government can do surveillance and obey the law at the same time.  We Democrats are not against wiretaps – we just what FISA obeyed.  But carping about protecting our chemical plants, bridges, and tunnels?  It is criminal that this Administration has shortchanged protecting these assets.  Yes, the National Review do wedge issues, but little else.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.policyreview.org/138/eberstadt.html">Nicholas Eberstadt</a> declares victory in the War on Poverty.  I would hope <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/08/31/more-welfare-more-poverty">Michael Tanner</a> might read this portion of Eberstadt’s 30-page paper:<br />
<blockquote>One may note that most of the reported reduction in overall U.S. poverty, according to this federal poverty measure, occurred at the very beginning of the series &#8211; that is to say, during the first decade for which numbers are available. Between 1959 and 1968, the OPR for the total population of the United States fell from 22.4 percent to 12.8 percent, or by more than a point per year. In 2004, by contrast, the U.S. poverty rate was only imperceptibly lower than it had been in 1968 &#8211; and actually slightly higher than it had been back in 1969. Indeed, to judge by the official poverty rate, the United States has suffered a generation and more of stagnation &#8211; or even retrogression &#8211; in its quest to reduce poverty. Figure 1 illustrates the situation. For the entire U.S. population, the lowest OPR yet recorded was for the year 1973, when the index bottomed at 11.1 percent. Over the subsequent three decades, the OPR nationwide has remained steadily above 11.1 percent, often substantially; in 2004, the rate reported was 12.7 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>A combination of strong overall growth in the 1960’s and LBJ’s War on Poverty did lower the poverty rate.  Since then, the poverty rate has experienced periods where it has increased – either because of recessions or because the government scaled back our anti-poverty efforts.  We have also seen periods where the poverty rate has decreased because of increases in our anti-poverty efforts and economic growth.</p>
<p>Eberstadt, however, is saying that the changes in the official poverty rate is a poor measure of how success (or lack thereof) in reducing poverty.  While much of his paper is of interest, this following strikes me as silly:<br />
<blockquote>Curiously, the official poverty rate does not seem to exhibit the normal and customary relationship with any of these other poverty proxies. Table 1 illustrates the problem. It contrasts results for the years 1973 and 2001 for the official poverty rate and several other indicators widely recognized as bearing directly upon the risk of poverty in any modern urbanized society. (The choice of these two specific end-years is admittedly and deliberately selective &#8211; but it is a selection that highlights the underlying contradictions discussed below.) In the period between 1973 and 2001, for example, per capita income in the United States rose very significantly in real (inflation-adjusted) terms: by roughly 60 percent, according to estimates from the Census Bureau’s CPS series.</p></blockquote>
<p>Increases in average income per capita would be expected to lower poverty if these gains were evenly spread across the population.  But we know that most of these gains have gone to higher income groups.  Eberstadt tosses in three other variables including the unemployment rate (more on this later), the percent of people with a high school education, and total non-medical means tested government spending.</p>
<p>While it is encouraging that 84% of the population had a high school degree in 2001, the fact that 16% of the population still does not strikes me as one explanation why the poverty rate has not dipped below 10%.  If Eberstadt is using total non-medical means tested government spending (inflation adjusted) in his regressions – might I suggest that he use per capita spending instead especially since he writes:<br />
<blockquote>Between Fiscal Year 1973 and Fiscal Year 2001, real spending on such programs more than tripled, leaping from $153 billion to $484 billion (in constant 2002 dollars), or by over 150 percent on a per capita inflation-adjusted basis. One can make arguments for excluding the health and medical care component from the measure of antipoverty program spending; doing the sums, nonhealth antipoverty spending would still rise in constant 2002 terms from $109 billion in 1973 to $231 billion in 2001, or by 57 percent per capita.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be interesting to track real spending per capita over time given the differences in attitudes of Administrations such as Reagan’s in the 1980’s and Clinton’s in the 1990’s.  That health care spending has outpaced general inflation is no surprise given the fact that health care costs have generally increased by more than the overall CPI.  Which brings us to what may be Eberstadt’s main point:   <br />
<blockquote>It embraces an inappropriate deflator for its inter-temporal adjustments in price levels.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, if the relative price of necessities such as food declines, using the overall consumer price index might be misleading.  But the increase in the relative price of health care works in the opposite direction in terms of any alleged CPI bias.  Eberstadt continues with some rather silly complaints:<br />
<blockquote>It takes no account in “money income” of either personal taxes paid or capital gains reaped &#8211; quantities that have been on the rise over the past generation. It is biased because it makes no imputation for the implicit rental “income” homeowners enjoy through occupying their own properties.</p></blockquote>
<p>How many poor people do you know that enjoy income from a portfolio of stocks and own a house?  </p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a1-715162.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a1-708536.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>But let’s talk about this alleged positive correlation between the poverty rate and the unemployment rate (I had to find some excuse for the above graph).  As Eberstadt admits, his focus on the 1973 to 2001 period is “deliberately selective”.  The correlation between these two series over the entire 1959 to 2005 is near zero.  Does this mean the often heard claim &#8211; that economic booms tend to lower poverty and recessions tend to raise poverty – has been discredited?  Not quite as one can trace much of the increases in the poverty rate to identified recessions and much of the decreases in the poverty rate to recoveries.  It has been well recognized by macroeconomists that the natural rate of unemployment is not constant over time so a simple correlation between the poverty rate and the unemployment rate is not particularly useful evidence as to whether there is business cycle effect.</p>
<p>But let me close by focusing on Eberstadt’s statement:<br />
<blockquote>And while the poverty threshold was devised to be measuring a fixed and unchanging degree of material deprivation (i.e., an “absolute” level of poverty) over time, an abundance of data on the actual living conditions of low-income families and “poverty households” contradicts that key presumption &#8211; demonstrating instead that the material circumstances of persons officially defined as poor have improved broadly and appreciably over the past four decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>The poverty rate is indeed based on a proxy for absolute levels of income as opposed to relative income levels.  The fact that the poverty rate today is approximately the same as it was when Richard Nixon become President suggests that relative income disparities have widened. As Eberstad argues that the measuring real income as nominal income divided by the CPI index understates one’s increase in well being, I am reminded of the fun that <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002471.html">Max Sawicky</a> had with an argument from <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2006/08/were_much_wealt.html">Don Boudreaux</a> as the latter wrote:<br />
<blockquote>It reveals that real median household income has increased, with the expected blips and surges, over the past 38 years. But being 31 percent higher today than it was in 1967 is not very impressive. This fact means that real household income grew at an average annual rate since 1967 of much less than one percent. But I ask: would you prefer to live in 1967 with today’s real median household income ($46,326) or live today with 1967’s real median household income ($35,379)?  (These figures are expressed in 2005 dollars, by the way.) Given these two options, I’d choose to live today with only 1967’s real median household income. The reason is that the economy today offers so very many more options than did the economy in 1967 – or even the economy of that halcyon year, 1973. Today I can buy cell-phone service; today I can buy cable television with hundreds of channels, including ones that specialize in sports, cooking, history, and science; today even the cheapest automobiles are safer and more reliable than were the finest cars for sale in 1967; today I can buy telephone answering machines (with caller-ID), microwave ovens, CDs, personal computers, Internet service, and MP3 players. Today I can watch movies in my own home – in color – whenever I want without having to wait for one of the three or four available television stations to telecast a movie for viewing on a black-and-white television. Today I can use GPS.</p></blockquote>
<p>A fine car with GPS is not exactly something those with income below the official poverty rate are enjoying.  So isn’t a reasonable proposition that correcting for this CPI bias would show that the relative income disparity has grown by even more than our conventional measures suggest?</p>

Maybe that&#8217;s standard, but I don&#8217;t see why they should receive special treatment with government generated statistics &#8230; But I can&#8217;t resist a few notes before I hit the road. First, are we surprised that when real wages of middle and low income workers fall, taxes fall? Or when the wealthy receive more income, they pay more taxes? Second, the graph confuses income and wealth. To me, that&#8217;s always a sign of sloppiness and I tend to discount the entire article when it is evident that nobody took the time to check things over carefully. The article only discusses income inequality, not wealth gaps. Third, the main point here is that inequality was also rising during the Clinton years, but it was largely ignored.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark documents that the rising gap in income was the topic of an interesting debate back in the 1990’s.  We are having another debate on the distribution of income.  Alas, this WSJ op-ed makes no contribution to it.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: As our <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2006/09/perversion-of-poverty.html">troll</a> decides to attack yours truly, he once again proves he has nothing original to offer.  Speaking of unwarranted attacks, the troll goes after <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2006/09/why-oh-why-cant-bad-bad-delong-be.html">Brad DeLong</a> as he completely misses several points with:<br />
<blockquote>We regretfully have to point out to the distinguished economist that one only makes valid comparisons by using same points in the business cycle. And when we do, we find that Mickey Kaus could have easily pointed to &#8216;good poverty news&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would be so easy to point out to this troll that he is contradicting himself (as in an economic recovery should have lowered the poverty rate by more than 0.1% OR BETTER &#8211; how troll uses some business cycle argument he also argues is nonsense &#8211; but COMPLETELY MISSES the fact that poverty fell dramatically during the late 1990&#8217;s), but the troll only allows team members to comment.  I guess he has no members of his team as his comment box is always empty.  </p>
<p>Memo to Donald Luskin &#8211; this year&#8217;s stupidest man alive contest will have some serious competition.</p>

<blockquote>But what is the &#8220;good poverty news&#8221; in the Census Bureau&#8217;s report? What is the &#8220;good poverty news&#8221; in this table? Is it that there are more people in extreme poverty than in any year since 1993? Is it that the proportion of Americans in extreme poverty is greater than in any year since 1997? Is it that the extreme poverty rate is 0.9%-2,336,000 people&#8211;higher than in 2000, at the last business cycle peak?  Is it that the overall poverty rate stands at 12.6%, 0.1% less than last year? Is it that the overall numbers in poverty stand at 36,950,000, 50,000 less than last year? Is it that 5,369,000 more people were poor last year than at the last business cycle peak, in 2000? Is it that the poverty rate is higher than in any year from 1999 to 2003 or from 1969 to 1979? Is it that the number of people in poverty this year and last year is greater than in any year since 1994? If you parse Kaus closely, he doesn&#8217;t actually say that there is &#8220;good poverty news.&#8221; He talks about how Bob Greenstein &#8220;specializes in&#8230; suggest[ing] that good poverty news is really bad poverty news&#8221; and about how Eric &#8220;Alterman [got] his bogus spin.&#8221; He wants his readers to think that there is a whole bunch of good poverty news that is being spun as bad, but he doesn&#8217;t actually say so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kaus wasn’t done in his imitation of Donald Luskin.  He continues:<br />
<blockquote>The purpose of welfare reform wasn&#8217;t to lower the poverty rate. It was to move people from welfare to work &#8230; If reform had accomplished this goal&#8211;a near-60% reduction in the families getting welfare**&#8211;with no increase in the poverty rate, that would be a victory. That the poverty rate has actually has fallen a full point from 1996 (13.7% then to 12.6% now&#8211;an 8% reduction) is a significant success.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Mickey Kaus doesn’t realize that economic growth tends to reduce poverty.  But as he is suggesting that the “welfare to work” wasn’t supposed to reduce poverty, I suspect <a href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/2006/08/welfare-deform-sad-anniversary.html">Robert Reich</a> is having a good laugh at Mickey Kaus’s expense!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">The Employment Situation Report</a> for August 2006 showed employment rising by only 128,000.  The unemployment rate fell to 4.7% &#8211; not because the labor force participation rate fell (it was unchanged) – but because the employment to population ratio rose from 63.0% to 63.1%.  You see – the household survey reported a 250,000 increase in employment.  I wonder what the rightwing spin will be this month?</p>
<p>Update: Since the Corner Kids over at National Review are too busy advocating World War III with the Muslim world, I figured the only real spinning would be coming from the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/09/20060901-1.html">White House</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Since August 2003, our economy has created more than 5.7 million jobs, and manufacturing production has risen 5.6 percent in the last year. Our economic expansion is lifting the lives of millions of our citizens, and we will continue to work toward developing sound economic polices that keep our economy moving forward and create more jobs for American workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m impressed that the President chose to stick with the payroll survey.  Of course, employment has increased by only 3 million since he took office in January 2001.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/02/business/02charts.html?ei=5088&#038;en=3374d565d799f3ce&#038;ex=1314849600&#038;partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss&#038;pagewanted=print">Floyd Norris</a> sort of falls for the unemployment is falling spin:<br />
<blockquote>NEARLY five years after the end of the 2001 recession in the United States, this recovery can be painted using employment statistics as the worst &#8211; or one of the best &#8211; of the aftermaths of the 10 post-World War II recessions. On the good side, the unemployment rate, at 5.5 percent in November 2001, was down to 4.7 percent in August, the Labor Department reported yesterday. In similar periods after ends of the nine previous downturns, the unemployment rate was that low only once. The low unemployment rate has come about despite a slow rate of job creation … To some extent, the divergent indicators reflect the fact that the numbers come from two surveys with different methodologies and, in recent years, differing trends. The jobs figure comes from a Labor Department survey of establishments and lately it has tended to produce gloomier numbers than the other survey the department performs, in which households are asked which members have jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/09/a_labor_day_loo.html">Brad DeLong</a> compliments Mr. Norris on this article as he takes care of the couple of problems:<br />
<blockquote>the most obvious explanation is that employment is low because the labor market is weak, and taht labor force participation is y because half a decade of a weak labor market has convinced a lot of people that they have better things to do&#8211;go to school, raise a kid, retire early, et cetera&#8211;than look for a lousy job. Norris gets two things wrong, however. He gets the lead wrong: I haven&#8217;t heard anybody&#8211;not even White House spinmaasters&#8211;paint the emploment recovery as &#8220;one of the best&#8221; since World War II. That doesn&#8217;t pass the laugh test. And he overstates the role played by the divergence between the household and establishment surveys. They don&#8217;t paint all that different pictures.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, Brad has a few spelling errors, but he captures my thoughts perfectly.</p>

                                <p>Incredibly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/01/business/worldbusiness/01rupee.html?ex=1314763200&#038;en=b5f0ab2479025bd5&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Keith Bradsher</a> thinks so:<br />
<blockquote>A prime reason India is now developing into the world’s next big industrial power is that a number of global manufacturers are already looking ahead to a serious demographic squeeze facing China. Because of China’s “one child” policy, family sizes have been shrinking there since the 1980’s, so fewer young people will be available soon for factory labor.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which draws some fire from <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/09/chinas_demographic_squeeze_hav_1.html#006115">Dean Baker</a>: <br />
<blockquote>China’s supply of manufacturing workers will not be limited by its population anytime soon for the simple reason that close to half of its work force is still in agriculture. So, there is not any imminent shortage of manufacturing workers in China. Now, there is a separate point. There is some evidence (noted in the article) that wages are rising in China. This is not a “demographic squeeze,” this is the desired result of economic growth. Chinese workers, like New York Times reporters, would like better living standards. The fact that workers might be experiencing rising living standards is good news for China – the opposite of a problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – higher wages are the result of an outward shift of the demand curve and not some alleged inward shift of the supply curve.  Could we reasonably expect those writing on economic issues for the New York Times to understand this basic concept?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader YC points us to <a href="http://www.zhonghuarising.com/2006/08/thirty_years_on_the_east_side_1.html">Yuan Yao</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The green paper report on population and labor by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) showed that after 2016, the aging population is set to increase dramatically, and the size of the labor force will drop accordingly. Economists said if this situation becomes a reality China’s cheap labor advantage may disappear. Actually the problem has already emerged in China’s most development areas including the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River delta, where the labor supply could not meet the demand in years. Indeed China’s economic growth has mainly relied on its ample supply of labor. It is the labor intensive manufacturing and processing industries that have given China such an advantage in the world economy. Without sufficient labor supply, these industries will collapse.</p></blockquote>
<p>This post is clearing talking about a current outward shift of the demand with a potential future inward shift of available supply in certain regions.  While I still think Dean Baker has a point about the latter, AB readers K Harris and KNZN frame this nicely in terms of elasticity of supply and possible heterogeneity of workers &#8211; with part of this coming from they live in relationship to where the jobs are.</p>
