                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/08/more_entitlement_nonsense_at_t.html#005763">Dean Baker</a> continues to beat up on the Washington Post coverage of fiscal policy matters:<br />
<blockquote>Yet again the Post reports on the threat posed by “entitlement” spending, referring to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. To quickly repeat myself, this is dishonest. There are modest and manageable increases in projected Social Security spending due to the aging of the population. There are unmanageable projected increases in Medicare and Medicaid expenditures due to a projected explosion in health care costs. If the projected explosion in health care costs proves accurate, then it will devastate the economy, and cause serious budget problems. Honest people respond to these projections by examining ways to prevent the explosion in health care costs. Less honest people talk about the need to cut entitlement spending, including Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>I loved the title that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/10/AR2006081001508.html">Michael Abramowitz</a> choose for his “nonsense”.  Also note:<br />
<blockquote>No specific plan has been advanced, and administration officials are proceeding gingerly given the political debacle that beset the White House last year when President Bush promoted a plan to create private accounts in the Social Security program. But they have been sending strong signals in recent weeks that they want to try something again after the elections in November.</p></blockquote>
<p>We’ll likely hear the usual garbage from the GOP that we Democrats have no plan.  Well, I have a suggestion: scrap the prescription drug benefit until we can come up with a less costly way of achieving better benefits for the elderly and we come up with the tax base to finance it.  And I’m sure Dean Baker would love to talk about other ways to address the inefficiencies in how we delivery health care.  </p>
<p>I was impressed with some realism coming from Grover Norquist:<br />
<blockquote>Grover Norquist, a leading GOP strategist, said he can envision no circumstance in which Bush could secure any overhaul of the Social Security program, including creating personal accounts. &#8220;The Democrats cannot be bribed, cajoled or threatened into voting for Social Security reform &#8211; it can&#8217;t happen,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story continues by noting that the Republicans wish to duck this issue until after the November 2006 issue.  That was exactly their strategy during the 2004 campaigns.  Look – if they have some notions for changing the Social Security system – wouldn’t it be nice to inform the voters as to their intentions before the elections?</p>

                                <p>The rightwingers of the Republican Party are in a foul mood now that Joseph Lieberman lost in the Democratic primary.  First up is <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh081006.shtml">David BoBo Brooks</a> calling for civility as he hurls insults at unnamed Democrats.  As the always excellent Bob Somerby notes:<br />
<blockquote>People want civility, not venom, Brooks says. But uh-oh! Even as he tells us this, he emits vast poison of his own, name-calling those with whom he disagrees in the most venomous manner. Could you possibly write a less civil column? A column driven more by venom? In paragraph 2, Brooks establishes moral equivalence between “scandal-tainted Tom DeLay” and—you guessed it—Ned Lamont. No, Lamont isn’t tainted by any known scandal—but he had “the net roots exulting before him and Al Sharpton smiling just behind” when he won his race Tuesday night. As a result, Brooks name-calls Lamont and his supporters in the most egregious ways. What does he tell us about these people? Brooks sheds his deep desire for civility as he name-calls and slimes:</p>
<p>In paragraph 3, we learn that Lamont supporters engage in “the Sunni-Shiite style of politics.”</p>
<p>In paragraph 4, we learn that Lamont supporters are “flamers” who “tell themselves that their enemies are so vicious they have to be vicious too.” Indeed, “[t]hey rationalize their behavior by insisting that circumstances have forced them to shelve their integrity for the good of the country.”</p>
<p>In paragraph 5, we learn that Lamont supporters are “hyper-partisans;” they “may have started with subtle beliefs, but their beliefs led them to partisanship and their partisanship led to malice and malice made them extremist.”</p>
<p>And in paragraph 6, we learn, by inference, that Lamont people favor venom, not civility. Later, Brooks refers to them as a “hostile force” inside the Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Wow! For someone so deeply in love with civility, Brooks really lets himself go in this piece! He doesn’t name a single Democrat who has actually misbehaved; he doesn’t explain what any Dem has done wrong. But so what? In a sweeping, name-calling indictment, he seems to say that Lamont supporters are “vicious” “flamers” who have “shelved their integrity” so they can “engage in Sunni-Shiite politics.” They’re “extremists,” we are told. Their partisanship has “led them to malice.” For ourselves, we’ll only say this about that: Thank God David Brooks is in love with civility! Just think how this morning’s piece might have read if he’d let his own venom break loose!</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/08/10/mehlman-murtha">Ken Mehlman</a> knows nothing about civility or integrity with his usual crap such as:<br />
<blockquote>The message from Connecticut is clear, and Ned Lamont isn’t alone. He is joined by Rep. John Murtha &#8230; who claims America is more dangerous than Iran and North Korea.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know, I know – it’s well established that Ken Mehlman is a serial liar.  </p>
<p>Then we have <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/10/lieberman.ap/index.html">Lieberman</a> acting like what he truly is – a rightwing Republican:<br />
<blockquote>WATERBURY, Connecticut (AP) &#8211; Sen. Joe Lieberman set out on his go-it-alone re-election campaign Thursday and seized on the terror arrests in Britain to argue that his Democratic opponent, Ned Lamont, does not fully understand the danger facing the nation.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s check the transcripts of last night’s <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0608/09/lkl.01.html">Larry King Live</a>, which included George Mitchell and Neil Boortz:<br />
<blockquote>MITCHELL: Well it&#8217;s clearly, Larry, further reducing the credibility of the United States around the world. It&#8217;s already the lowest it&#8217;s ever been. The fact is ironically American power is the greatest it&#8217;s ever been in our history but America&#8217;s standing in the world is the lowest it&#8217;s ever been. And it&#8217;s not just the Muslim world. It&#8217;s everywhere, including our closest allies Britain and other places. What you see, Larry, in the Middle East now is the narrative of each side taking hold and deepening. Whenever you have these conflicts there&#8217;s a point of view, a narrative, and here you have the Lebanese and Israeli narratives and they almost always in conflict situations emphasize the hurt that&#8217;s done to my side and minimize the hurt that&#8217;s done to the other side. That happens all the time in all cases. The task of leadership, and here it is the task of the United States, although our credibility has been impaired in recent years it&#8217;s still necessary to get this job done is to understand the narrative of both sides and to find that narrow band of common ground that exists in every single conflict that you can bring the parties together on to end the violence. Because I&#8217;ll tell you it&#8217;s horrific for everyone to have this violence on both sides. The problem is the more casualties you get the more the demand for revenge, the more casualties result, the more the demand for revenge.</p></blockquote>
<p>Boortz takes the statement “a point of view, a narrative, and here you have the Lebanese and Israeli narratives” and twists it thusly:<br />
<blockquote>This idea of &#8211; I heard the Senator talking about understanding the narratives. Well, Hezbollah is an arm of Iran and we understand the narrative from Iran. It&#8217;s Israel must be wiped off the face of the earth. So, Israel has a right to self defense. They&#8217;re exercising it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later, the host gave the Senator a chance to reply to the dishonesty of Mr. Boortz:<br />
<blockquote>MITCHELL: Yes, Larry. Mr. Boortz apparently misunderstood what I said because when I was talking about the competing narratives I was speaking, and I believe I said Israel and Lebanon. He said that I spoke of Hezbollah. Before this happened Hezbollah was a minority party in Lebanon. The majority of the government and the people of Lebanon opposed Hezbollah. So Lebanon and Hezbollah are not identical. And as you know, Larry, on this show I have condemned Hezbollah&#8217;s actions as reckless and wrong. So I wanted to make sure that his inaccurate comment was responded to lest it be taken as true.</p></blockquote>
<p>These rightwing Republicans are not fighting a real war against Osama bin Laden as they are much more interested in fighting a war of words (and dishonest ones at that) with the American people.  And unfortunately, Joe Lieberman has joined forces with these Rovian forces.  It’s time to remove the neo-McCarthyites from power and allow competent and honest leaders to finally go after Al Qaeda.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/08/10/delay-liberals">Think Progress</a> nails “criminally indicted ex-Rep. Tom DeLay” for saying that liberal “don’t want to fight this war on terrorism” and having the view “can’t we all get along? … You can’t go after these wonderful people that just killed a bunch of Americans.”  Think Progress notes:<br />
<blockquote>This is a classic Rovian tactic. An overwhelming majority 84% of national security experts &#8211; liberal and conservative &#8211; believe America is losing the war on terror under the guidance of the Bush administration. Instead of addressing the failure of their approach, Delay and other White House surrogates attack their opponents on the same issue. It may or may not be a successful political strategy but it definitely doesn’t make the country safer. </p></blockquote>
<p>Invading Iraq helped Al Qaeda.  The rightwing Republicans don’t want to fight the real war on terrorism as they might actually get in the way of their war on Democrats.  </p>
<p>DeLay is also calling for overwhelming force in Iraq and Lebanon.  I’m sure that he’s not busy passing out taxpayer’s money as a Congressman, he’ll enlist in the army and go lead the charge in Baghdad along with his fellow chickenhawks.</p>

<p>It would not be news to suggest the op-ed pages of the Wall Street Journal often contain some really stupid comments, but <a href="http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users2&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB115508135412330481.html">this</a> takes the cake:<br />

<blockquote>If there is no short-run tradeoff between output/unemployment and inflation, then the WSJ editors should have no objection to the Fed raising the federal funds rate (i.e. cutting money growth) by whatever amount is necessary to hit, say, a 1% inflation rate in 3-6 months (with no short-run tradeoff, this amount of time isn&#8217;t needed, but let&#8217;s not be overly demanding). Rates of 15%, 20%, 25%? 50% if needed? No problem. It doesn&#8217;t matter how high rates go, unemployment and output won&#8217;t change in the short-run &#8211; so just get rid of inflation no matter how high rates need to go. I bet the WSJ editors, and their readers in the business community, would worry about GDP falling. If so, they believe in a short-run Phillips curve no matter what they say in public. Their idea of the short-run might be a shorter time period than mine, and that can affect policy choices, e.g. how aggressive to move against inflation, but that&#8217;s a matter of degree, not substance.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I agree with Dr. Thoma, let me suggest why this rebuttal is not sufficient.  Mark and I likely did our graduate work in economics around the same time during the era that followed Milton Friedman’s 1968 Presidential address.  Friedman was suggesting there was no long-run tradeoff, which is now a very well accepted proposition, but also argued there was a short-run tradeoff.  In my view, his market clearing model with adaptive expectations was doomed from the start as all a few other very bright economists (e.g., Thomas Sargent and Robert Lucas) had to do was to combine market clearing with rational expectations and the theoretical case for a short-run tradeoff evaporated.  </p>
<p>Those of us who question whether labor markets quickly clear might also ask &#8211; what is the historical record with prior episodes of using tight monetary policy to reduce inflation?  I have chosen two periods of time with the first being a period surrounding Friedman’s 1968 Presidential address.  The critics of Keynesian thought often point to the acceleration of inflation during the late 1960’s, which in my view is a dishonest argument given the fact that the Keynesian economists on President Johnson’s CEA were arguing for aggregate demand restraint as early as December 1965.  The fact that the politicians ignored the CEA recommendations preferring to listen to crackpot Norman Ture (the mentor of the free lunch supply-side lunatics that the WSJ editors worship) is not a condemnation of Keynesian thought.  The record of unemployment from 1966 to 1971 shows that unemployment did decline during the period of rapid aggregate demand growth and that it did increase when the Federal Reserve during the early days of Nixon’s Presidency followed Dr. Friedman’s advice.  </p>
<p>The second episode from 1979 to 1982 shows the record of the Volcker Federal Reserve as it tried to reduce inflation through tight monetary policy.  We began with the Carter recession (1979-1980), which was followed by the anemic Carter recovery (1980-1981) as Volcker temporarily backed off from his tight monetary regime.  The next step was quite unfortunate as a group of free lunch supply-side lunatics convinced President Reagan to adopt a policy of long-run fiscal insanity, which prompted the Volcker Federal Reserve to adopt round II of tight monetary policy.  Now if the editors of the Wall Street Journal are correct that the short-run Phillips curve did not exist, my graph which shows the rise in the unemployment rate is a bit of data these editors need to explain – assuming they know to recognize the historical record.</p>

<blockquote>Joe Lieberman played an important role in laying the basis for the accounting scandals of the stock bubble era. Senator Lieberman’s role dates back to 1993. This was the year when he led the charge against the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in its effort to require firms to treat stock options as an expense against profit. At the time, companies were able to issue stock options to employees and treat them on their books as though the options had no cost. FASB had become concerned because of the rapid growth in the use of stock options, especially in the tech sector. After carefully examining the issue, FASB issued new rules requiring that options be treated as an expense. Senator Lieberman led the counterattack, arguing that the new rules would depress stock prices. (Interesting thought – how can accurate accounting depress stock prices?) Lower stock prices would damage the tech sector and cost jobs. Lieberman managed to push through an 88-9 vote on a non-binding Senate resolution opposing the change. FASB got the message and backed down on its proposed rules change. The rest is history &#8230; There may not have been a single person in the state of Connecticut who voted against Senator Lieberman yesterday because of his harassment of FASB. Other issues loomed larger. But those who think that honest accounting is essential to the working of the economy might believe that some justice was done in this election.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure where Lamont stands on this issue, but for all of those who think of Lieberman as John McCain’s ally in bipartisanship – remember that Senator McCain wanted to allow FASB to do its job without the political influence of the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/06/stock-options-lieberman-lobbyists-in.html">Lieberman Lobbyists</a>.  And where did George W. Bush stand on this issue?  Oh yea – he wanted to give corporations the option as to whether to follow the recommendations of FASB or not properly reporting the expense from employee stock options.</p>

<blockquote>In 2003, a whistle-blower forced San Diego to reveal that it had been shortchanging its city workers’ pension fund for years, setting off a wave of lawsuits, investigations and eventually criminal indictments … Retirees are still being paid, but a portion of their benefits is in doubt because of continuing legal challenges. And the city, which is scheduled to receive a report today on the causes of its current predicament, still has to figure out how to close the $1.4 billion shortfall in its pension fund.  Maybe someone should be paying closer attention in New Jersey. And in Illinois. Not to mention Colorado and several other states and local governments. Across the nation, a number of states, counties and municipalities have engaged in many of the same maneuvers with their pension funds that San Diego did, but without the crippling scandal &#8211; at least not yet. It is hard to know the extent of the problems, because there is no central regulator to gather data on public plans. Nor is the accounting for government pension plans uniform, so comparing one with another can be unreliable. But by one estimate, state and local governments owe their current and future retirees roughly $375 billion more than they have committed to their pension funds. And that may well understate the gap: Barclays Global Investments has calculated that if America’s state pension plans were required to use the same methods as corporations, the total value of the benefits they have promised would grow 22 percent, to $2.5 trillion. Only $1.7 trillion has been set aside to pay those benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/08/public-employee-pension-mess.html">Andrew Samwick</a> called this New Jersey approach “clever” as he wondered why the Enron folks didn’t think of it:<br />
<blockquote>Still, officials in Trenton have been shortchanging New Jersey’s pension fund for years, much as San Diego did. From 1998 to 2005, the state overrode its actuary’s instructions to put a total of $652 million into the fund for state employees. Instead, it provided a little less than $1 million. Funds for judges, teachers, police officers and other workers got less, too. To make up the missing money, New Jersey officials tried an approach similar to one used in San Diego. They said they would capture the “excess” gains they expected the pension funds’ investments to make and use them as contributions.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m wondering when the Cato Institute will take something like this approach to George Bush’s Social Security deformers.  When the National Association of State Retirement Administrators (NASRA) crowd suggested it was not realistic to expect pension funds to be fully funded, Dr. Samwick sensibly remarked:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;s no financial literacy requirement to be a spokesperson for NASRA. Wishing won&#8217;t make this problem go away. At some point, state and local taxes go up or benefits to public employees or retirees get cut.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>We Angrybears have been accused of mischaracterizing data by someone who fails to cite any specific example.  But this fellow did provide a couple of links to op-eds that seem to be calling for the repeal of the estate tax.  Let’s review both.  First up is <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/paul/paul328.html">Ron Paul</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Fortunately, estate taxes no longer devour 60% of some individuals’ wealth when they die. Congress passed legislation in 2001 that reduced estate tax rates and increased the amount of assets exempt from the tax. Yet Congress has been unable to abolish the estate tax altogether, and, due to a political compromise the old rates will be back in effect come 2011 unless Congress acts first. The estate tax raises very little money. In fact, even at its height the estate tax accounted for only a little more than 1% of federal revenues. A congressional Joint Economic committee report estimates that Americans spend as much avoiding estate taxes – paying attorneys and accountants – as they do paying estate taxes. A study by a Stanford professor concluded that “True revenues associated with estate taxation may well have been near zero, or even negative.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The estate tax never devoured 60% of someone’s wealth.  Even assuming one did not play games with the valuations of one’s asset, the highest marginal rate before 2001 was only 55%.  The average tax rate depended on the value of the estate given the tax rate scheduled, which was kindly provided by the <a href="http://www.ctj.org/html/estate.htm">Citizens for Tax Justice</a>.   </p>
<p>The Stanford professor happens to be Douglas Bernheim who wrote <a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w2087">Does the Estate Tax Raise Revenues</a> with the conclusion being:<br />
<blockquote>Although it is very difficult to estimate these effects precisely, in recent years true estate tax revenues may well have been negative.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next up is <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/archives/fm/9-95.html">Lew Rockwell</a> <br />
<blockquote>Left-liberals hate the idea, but the prosperity of everyone in a market economy depends in good part on the rich. The capital they have earned and saved generates investments and creates jobs. Their savings keep interest rates low. Their actions are philanthropic in every sense. In their professions, they help everyone prosper. In their charity, they help the poor, and allow the arts and education to thrive.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m a liberal and I don’t hate either the idea of prosperity or market economies.  I realize that increasing savings and investment is key to increasing opportunities for workers, but I reject the notion that we need to shift the burden of taxation onto the working poor in order to promote long-term growth.  Lew Rockwell and Ron Paul are not economists and I find their selective use of quotes from economists they don’t even bother to name not exactly an enlightening way to discuss the pros and cons of tax policy.</p>
<p><strong>Footnote</strong>: Given the suggestion that Ron Paul wants tax cuts for everyone, I could (perhaps should as I did in the comments section) bring up the long-run government budget constraint, but then <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/08/without_tax_cut.html">Mark Thoma</a> has put my point quite nicely:<br />
<blockquote>What I am suggesting is that we think hard about who pays for the tax cuts &#8211; should it be a tax shift to reduce distortions or should it be cuts to programs &#8211; because it&#8217;s very clear tax cuts won&#8217;t pay for themselves.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I don’t expect to post very frequently, but something came up and I have to rant. I’m not sure this rant is really Angry Bear material, but since AB made the mistake of letting me in, well, who am I not to abuse his hospitality?</p>
<p>Yesterday, I got a jury duty summons in the mail. (Ironically, this week my girlfriend is “doing her civic duty” though so far she was excused by phone for the first two days of the week.) Most people have a problem with jury duty – its inconvenient, and often one spends more time sitting around doing nothing than actually “serving.” I have another problem. I’m a consultant. I’ve been lucky enough to do a very wide range of work, from straight-up economics and forecasting for telecom companies, to more oddball stuff like looking at the failure rate of military satellites or risks associated with developing new software.</p>
<p>Regardless of the project, I am expected to either come in knowing a lot about the subject, or to pick it up very quickly. I’m expected to ask questions, often, a lot of questions, and to seek out whatever additional information and tools I need to do the job as well as I can subject to the client’s constraints (cost, time, etc.). Similarly, I assume that in general, I haven’t been selected at random by the client – instead, presumably the client believes that while there are, no doubt, people who can do that particular job as well or better at the same or lower cost, the cost in time and dollars of finding those people exceeds the marginal benefits. Additionally, if for some reason I don’t think I am the person for the job, I will pass on the job and at times even help the client find someone better.</p>
<p>Jury duty doesn’t work that way at all. The people making the decision, often an important decision, perhaps even one of life or death, or that affects the livelihood and well-being of many people, are the least informed people in the court-room. What they can and cannot know is determined by the attorneys for both sides, and the judge. The jury cannot ask questions, nor are they allowed to search out additional information or develop additional expertise.</p>
<p>One supposed goal of this process seems to be impartiality. But… if the judge has any bias at all, he will ensure that the only information the jury has at its disposal is biased. Therefore, the jury system gives up the likelihood of a knowledgeable jury making informed decisions, without even getting impartiality in exchange. It seems to me if the system is set up to achieve unbiased but ignorant outcomes, a lot of time, effort and energy can be saved by simply flipping a coin.</p>

OK, I may be just a mere servant in the order, but let me turn the microphone over to Larry:<br />
<blockquote>Top generals John P. Abizaid, the head of military operations in Iraq, and Peter Pace, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, are strongly suggesting that Iraq may be sinking from a state of violent sectarian unrest into a true civil war. But if that weren’t bad enough, Stuart Bowen, the special inspector general for Iraq reconstruction, now estimates that corruption costs in Iraq have reached a startling $4 billion per year. This is vital taxpayer war money &#8211; money you’d think would be safeguarded by the GOP Congress. But nothing, it seems, could be further from the truth. A Wall Street Journal story on the subject states that “the Bush administration continues to wind down its ambitious Iraq reconstruction program, which has spent ten of billions of dollars on rebuilding efforts that have largely failed to restore basic services such as water or electricity to pre-war levels.” And why has this spending failed? Sen. Susan Collins (R., Me.), the chair of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee that overseas the war money, says this is a story of “mistakes made, plans poorly conceived, overwhelmed by ongoing violence, and the waste, greed, and corruption that drains dollars that should have been used to build schools, improve the electrical grid, and repair the oil infrastructure.” True enough, corruption is a big part of this problem, in particular the oil smuggling that continues to siphon off what could be precious oil revenues for Iraq. U.S. Comptroller General David Walker says 10 percent of Iraq’s refined fuels and 30 percent of its imported fuels are being stolen. But Bowen says this is a problem that began at home: “the Bush administration’s overall handling of Iraq contracting &#8211; from relying on no-bid contracts even when major fighting had ended, to failing to standardize contracting regulations to help prevent fraud &#8211; was deeply flawed.” He goes on to say that the U.S. has not provided the proper contracting and procurement support necessary to manage reconstruction efforts that were begun three years ago, and also cites widespread mismanagement among competing U.S. government agencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Larry recommends Congressional oversight and the return of Harry Truman – who incidentally was a Democrat.</p>

<blockquote>So many superrich Americans evade taxes using offshore accounts that law enforcement cannot control the growing misconduct, according to a Senate report that provides the most detailed look ever at high-level tax schemes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This article drew the attention of <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/08/gimme_tax_shelt.html">Mark Thoma</a>, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002388.html">Max Sawicky</a>, and <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/monthly/2006_08.php">Kevin Drum</a>.  Kevin recommends:<br />
<blockquote>Better statutes and more auditors would help, as would appointment of judges who don&#8217;t turn themselves into pretzels to find reasons to approve of convoluted tax avoidance schemes. (&#8220;The money changed hands for two and a half minutes? Sounds like a genuinely risky investment to me, not a sham transaction. Case dismissed!&#8221;) There is, literally, no non-laughable argument for not cracking down on this stuff.</p></blockquote>
<p>An earlier article by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/23/business/23tax.html?ex=1311307200&#038;en=a1b03ade9e7403fc&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">David Cay Johnson</a> noted:<br />
<blockquote>The federal government is moving to eliminate the jobs of nearly half of the lawyers at the Internal Revenue Service who audit tax returns of some of the wealthiest Americans, specifically those who are subject to gift and estate taxes when they transfer parts of their fortunes to their children and others.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_07/009222.php">Kevin</a> calls this for what it is – a de facto repeal of the Estate Tax.  <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/07/cutting-back-irs-enforcement-staff.html">Dean Baker</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>these lawyers generate an average of more than $2,000 per hour of work in revenue for the government. This implies, that unless they are paid more than $4 million a year, the government will lose money by laying them off.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have argued that effective enforcement of the Estate Tax would require that the government improves its ability to spot <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/pick-your-effective-estate-tax-rate.html">low-ball valuations</a>. </p>
<p>One could note the good news that the IRS is increasing its staff to enforce the transfer pricing regulations against attempts by multinational enterprises to shift income from U.S. entities to their offshore affiliates.  We at Angrybear have spent a fair number of posts over whether the IRS is appropriately addressing transfer pricing enforcement, including <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/corporate-taxation-transfer-pricing.html">this example</a>: <br />
<blockquote>But you might ask don’t the tax authorities have economists working for them as do the representatives of national tax authorities. While they do, I would ask you to review some of the insightful (if not jaded) comments from AB reader OldVet as to how the attorneys for the IRS seem to get in the way of effective transfer pricing enforcement while those pretending to be economists for the representatives of the taxpayer play the economists at the tax authorities for fools with “analyzes” so disingenuous that I suspect the National Review would refuse to put their writings up as being credible. Note, however, that the point that Kash and Alfons J. Weichenrieder make is that tax authorities often ask their economists to also act like overpriced whores. At the end of the day, honest multinationals have to pay more to avoid double taxation, while those who engage in transfer pricing manipulation to evade U.S. taxation somehow escape effective scrutiny. I wish it were as simple as the line in Shakespeare&#8217;s Henry VI: &#8220;The first thing we do, let&#8217;s kill all the lawyers&#8221;. Yet, these lawyers are trained to be advocates. Economists are not trained to be paid whores, but alas we see so many behaving that way.</p></blockquote>
<p>The point that Kash was making in his paper with Alfons J. Weichenrieder is that tax authorities unfortunately go after honest multinationals, which imposes either double taxation or compliance costs.  The IRS often goes after the small fish in these endeavors, but alas they often leave the big fish alone even when the big fish are doing some brazenly suspect transfer pricing games.  </p>
<p>Consider, for example, the transfer pricing game that got <a href="http://accounting.smartpros.com/x45269.xml">Tommy Hilfiger</a> in hot water:<br />
<blockquote>Tommy Hilfiger may not be the only company to find itself on the hot seat over the potential to use foreign buying offices to improperly shift income overseas and, thereby, avoid paying U.S. income taxes. As large American manufacturers have moved production abroad throughout the last decade, the practice of using foreign buying offices to help source, develop and produce merchandise has become widespread and so has the potential for fraud, analysts said.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Tommy Hilfiger initially paid its related its related party foreign buying office a commission equal to 10% of goods purchased, the government ultimately allowed it to charge a commission rate equal to 7.5%.  I’m not sure whether Wal Mart does the same transfer pricing game, but since everyone likes to pick on the world’s largest distributor, let’s do as well.  Wal Mart purchases about $20 billion in goods from China so a 7.5% commission rate would translate into $1.5 billion in commission payments.  Maybe the arm’s length commission rate is 2.5% so the amount of income shifting is only $1 billion.  <strong>Only?</strong> </p>
<p>You might protest that it’s only 6% of Wal Mart’s worldwide income but its imports from China are about 8% of their total purchases.  Companies that rely more extensively on purchasing goods from China have been known to cut their effective tax rates in half or more.  And consider the fact that our imports from China are approaching $300 billion so if the typical income shift is 5% of these purchases, we are talking about losing $15 billion in the corporate income tax base.  </p>
<p>So isn’t this worth a little IRS scrutiny?  Our story on Tommy Hilfiger continues:<br />
<blockquote>The Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting an audit of toy maker Mattel, which uses foreign buying offices, according to SEC documents and a report by Prudential Equity Group analyst Lizabeth Dunn. Mattel spokeswoman Lisa Marie Bongiovanni said that it would be unfair to draw comparisons between Mattel and Tommy Hilfiger. An IRS audit is &#8220;done in the normal course of business,&#8221; Bongiovanni continued, &#8220;and does not mean that a law has been broken.&#8221; Companies that own foreign buying offices outright, as Tommy Hilfiger does, are likely to come under more scrutiny than those that hire outside firms to perform the same services, experts said. To protect themselves in the event of an audit, companies that own their own buying offices typically obtain what is called a transfer pricing agreement. The analysis, usually conducted by an accounting firm, scrutinizes the transactions to ensure they are conducted at arm&#8217;s length. </p></blockquote>
<p>While the IRS has its transfer pricing specialists, multinational enterprises can hire their own specialists.  Any guesses as to who will prevail in this “battle of the experts”? </p>
<p>As an aside that might get Brad Setser thinking, consider the claim from <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/print/globalbiz/content/may2006/gb20060522_662112.htm">Stephen Green</a> that <em>China’s Trade Surplus May Be an Illusion</em>, which rests in part on this argument: <br />
<blockquote>IN THE FAMILY.  This &#8220;mis-invoicing&#8221; of trade was commonplace in the last decade, but back then it was a way of getting money out of China. Now we think it is being used to bring funds in, given the strong likelihood the yuan will appreciate in value relative to foreign currencies down the road. This again inflates the value of Chinese exports. The exaggeration in the value of Chinese exports is probably getting another boost from the phenomenon of transfer pricing. This involves the price at which transactions between units of multinationals take place. When a mainland company trades with a sister company or affiliate offshore, the value of goods depends a great deal on where the company wants to book the profit. Usually firms will ensure that profit on trade transactions within a company are booked in lower tax jurisdictions. And that has usually meant offshore in the past, given the relatively high tax rates on the mainland compared to Hong Kong and other regional economies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another possible example of how transfer pricing manipulation may be part of the observed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/current-account-deficit-and-dark.html">Dark Matter</a>!</p>

                                <p>This is my first post&#8230; I apologize for any formatting errors&#8230;.</p>
<p>Tax reduction seems to be a signature policy of the GW administration, and there has been time to see how well it has worked (or not). Despite the rising chorus, the data just doesn’t seem to be cooperating with the administration or its supporters – real tax collections in 2005 were less than in 2000 <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/%3Ca">according to the Office of Management and Budget</a>, despite a growing economy and population. Before this administration took office, you would have had to go back to the Reagan administration’s tax cutting experiment to find a time when real tax collections were less than they had been five years earlier. One would think that would make it tough to argue that the tax cuts are “working”, but regular Angry Bear readers are treated to a periodic skewering of National Review who insist on trying anyway.</p>
<p>Another way to look at the tax issue is by comparing tax rates and economic performance across jurisdictions. Each of the fifty states has its own tax policies. If the tax cut crowd is correct, states with lower taxes should grow faster than states with higher taxes, for two reasons. The first is that the low taxes leave more money in people’s pockets, giving them more to spend and invest. The second is that people will vote with their feet, as per the Tiebout hypothesis.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/%3Ca">BEA website</a> reports real gross state product from 1990 to 2005. Combined state and local tax burden for each state from 1970 to 2006 is available from the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/%3Ca">Tax Foundation</a>. Because the Tax Foundation has impeccable credentials among the tax-cutting crowd, use of its data should be kosher for them.</p>
<p>The correlation between each state’s percentage change in Gross State Product and its tax burden for every year from 1991 to 2005 can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>minimum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;-64.2%<br />25th percentile&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-24.9%<br />median&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.8.4%<br />75th percentile&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..27.0%<br />maximum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..73.3%</p>
<p>average&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.. 0.7%</p>
<p>What this means is that the state with the lowest correlation between its percentage change in GSP and its tax burden has a correlation of –64.2%, the state with the highest such correlation shows a correlation of 73.3%. A negative correlation indicates that higher taxes are associated with slower growth rates, and a positive correlation indicates that higher taxes are associated with higher growth rates. Half of states fit into the interquartile range, with correlations between –24.9% and 27%. Additionally, the median correlation is 8.4% and the average is 0.7%. This first pass doesn’t seem to indicate much of a relationship between tax burdens and growth rates, and, if anything, since both the median and average correlations are positive, in at least half the states, lower tax burdens are associated with lower, not higher growth rates.</p>
<p>However… perhaps this isn’t true of states with high growth rates? Is it possible the fast growing states have discovered something about tax burdens that other states have not? Or perhaps the slow growth states are missing something obvious? The table below shows the same statistics for the states that have grown the fastest from 1990 to 2005, and for the states that have grown the slowest over the same period:</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;5 fastest growing&#8230;&#8230;.5 slowest growing<br />minimum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..-25.1%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-64.2%<br />25th percentile&#8230;&#8230;-18.3%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-54.7%<br />median &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..19.2%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-24.6%<br />75th percentile&#8230;&#8230;.30.4%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..28.9%<br />maximum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.35.7%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..43.4%</p>
<p>average&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;8.4%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-14.2%</p>
<p>On average, for fast growing states, there is a more positive correlation between growth rates and tax burdens than for states in general. Conversely, for the slow growing states, there actually is the negative correlation between tax burdens and growth rates that the tax-cutting crowd would have predicted for all states.</p>
<p>But maybe it takes time for tax cuts to work their magic? After all, people don’t decide to start a business or relocate overnight… A summary of the correlation between growth rates and tax burdens in the previous year is shown below:</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..all states&#8230;&#8230;.5 fast growing&#8230;&#8230;.5 slow growing<br />minimum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..-63.8%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..-19.3%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-63.8%<br />25th percentile.-15.5%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..-15.4%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-54.0%<br />median&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.11.6%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;18.3%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.-28.0%<br />75th percentile&#8230;..32.7%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;21.7%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..34.3%<br />maximum&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.65.3%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;65.3%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..54.9%</p>
<p>average&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..5.5%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.14.1%&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;-11.3%</p>
<p>Hmmm… perhaps not. Similar relationships persist lagging tax burdens by 2 years, 3 yeas, 5 years, 10 years and 20 years (beyond that I got bored), though, if anything, the average correlation between growth rates and lagged tax burdens has a slight tendency to increase as the lag length increases.</p>
<p>Thus, the data doesn’t seem to support the idea that lower taxes are associated with faster growth rates. In fact, the opposite is true, especially for the fastest growing states. One way to interpret this is to conclude that taxes are actually below their optimal rates, and therefore, at the margin, the government is actually more efficient than individuals at converting its spending into growth. Society needs a certain amount of public goods (infrastructure, public health, confronting the Canadian menace, etc.) for businesses to thrive, and perhaps we currently have too little provision of public goods rather than too much.</p>
