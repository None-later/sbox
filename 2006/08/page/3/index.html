                                <p>As <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/08/dating_business.html">James Hamilton</a> weighed in on when the most recent recession began, he also takes us back to the late 1970’s:</p>
<blockquote><p>For example, most of us would agree that the slowdown in inflation in the 1980s (for which President Reagan is sometimes credited) was due to Fed Chair Paul Volcker, who was in fact appointed by President Carter. Moreover, the primary reason that Volcker was able to bring inflation down was his willingness to contribute to an economic recession in 1980, for which Carter was blamed. Perhaps the real error was allowing inflation to accelerate as much as it did prior to Volcker, for which much of the blame would logically go to Fed Chair Arthur Burns, appointed by President Nixon in 1970, and G. William Miller, Carter&#8217;s pick in 1978. But even here there is a separate interesting question as to the contribution that bad real-time data may have made to those policy errors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Hamilton provided a link to an important paper by <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/1998/199803/199803pap.pdf">Athanasios Orphanides</a> on how the tradeoff between using timely data versus reliable data makes policy choices more difficult.</p>
<p>The “stagflation” of the late 1970’s presented the Federal Reserve with certain chooses that would have been difficult even if they had better real-time data.  I view the Carter years as being composed of three distinct periods as far as policy actions and the policy debates.  During the first year and a half, macroeconomic policy seemed to be designed on generating an investment led recovery by using monetary expansion – especially given Carter’s tendency towards fiscal conservatism.  By late 1978, unemployment had declined to just below 6% and with inflation accelerating, there was a period when Keynesians were split on what monetary policy should be.  Dr. Hamilton is making the case that monetary restraint should have been imposed well before Volcker became Federal Reserve chairman. </p>
<p>While some Keynesians were saying the same thing in late 1978, others were arguing that we were still well below full employment as we really had little consensus on whether the natural rate of unemployment was 5% or 6%.  Those Keynesians who believed that the natural rate was between 5% and 5.5% were arguing that the acceleration of inflation was due to oil price increases, dollar devaluation, or other cost-plus factors.  Even when the Volcker FED decided to adopt a Friedman type approach and ride us along the short-run Phillips curve to reduce inflation at the pain of a recession – these more liberal Keynesians strongly objected.  </p>
<p>This episode has a parallel in today’s debate.  While some of us still think the labor market is weak, other economists have applauded the FED for raising interest rates on the fear that excess aggregate demand would lead to an acceleration of inflation.  And for those of us who recall Volcker’s second round of monetary restraint, which was driven by Reagan’s fiscal insanity, it is hard to criticize today’s FED in light of the current fiscal insanity.  But there have some macroeconomists who are better forecasters than this Bear (I don’t discuss forecasts as I’d only make the weatherman look good) who are concerned that the tight monetary policy is about to lead to another recession.  On this score – the recent debates as to the natural rate of the employment to population ratio may be secondary to the issue raised by Dr. Hamilton and Athanasios Orphanides.</p>

<blockquote><p>So, pro-war hawks like myself would favor Lieberman. But of course the big problem I have is that the U.S. is not winning the war. Staying the course doesn’t sound like a solution to the massive sectarian violence going on in Iraq. On domestic policies, they’re both liberal Democrats opposing tax cuts, ANWR, and offshore drilling, and opposing the ban on partial-birth abortion. Lamont however may be slightly to the right of Lieberman on budget spending. In the CNBC interview with me, Lamont said he wanted to eliminate budget earmarks like the abusive transportation bill. Lieberman is a defender of earmarks.</p></blockquote>

Johns[t]on writes:<br />
<blockquote>Within two weeks, the I.R.S. will turn over data on 12,500 taxpayers &#8211; each of whom owes $25,000 or less in back taxes &#8211; to three collection agencies. Larger debtors will continue to be pursued by I.R.S. officers. The move, an initiative of the Bush administration, represents the first step in a broader plan to outsource the collection of smaller tax debts to private companies over time. Although I.R.S. officials acknowledge that this will be much more expensive than doing it internally, they say that Congress has forced their hand by refusing to let them hire more revenue officers, who could pull in a lot of easy-to-collect money.  The private debt collection program is expected to bring in $1.4 billion over 10 years, with the collection agencies keeping about $330 million of that, or 22 to 24 cents on the dollar.  By hiring more revenue officers, the I.R.S. could collect more than $9 billion each year and spend only $296 million &#8211; or about three cents on the dollar &#8211; to do so, Charles O. Rossotti, the computer systems entrepreneur who was commissioner from 1997 to 2002, told Congress four years ago. I.R.S. officials on Friday characterized those figures as correct, but said that the plan Mr. Rossotti had proposed had been forestalled by Congress, which declined to authorize it to hire more revenue officers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Beyond the potential abuse of lower income taxpayers as the IRS does not do the same thing for the fat cats, I don’t get the economics of this decision.  If it costs the government only 3 cents on the dollar, why is the commission rate for the private collectors set at 23 cents on the dollar.  Either these private collection agencies very inefficient relative to letting the government do the job internally – or this program will shift a lot of profits to some very lucky (perhaps politically connected) companies.  But isn’t this politics as usual ever since January 20, 2001?</p>
<p>Update: David Cay Johnston sends a kind email reminding yours truly to spell his last name correctly as I omitted the &#8220;t&#8221; in his last name.  Other reminder &#8211; his middle name starts with &#8220;c&#8221; not &#8220;k&#8221;.  Those of us who admire his writing own him the courtesy of getting his name right.</p>

                                <p>A reader asks <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/08/fair-tax.html">Greg Mankiw</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Professor: Could you shed some of your wisdom on the Boortz/Linder tax plan, the FairTax.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Mankiw said he liked the idea of collecting more of our taxes through a consumption tax, which is not surprising given his often stated view:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many economists &#8211; and I include myself among them &#8211; believe that consumption taxes are better than income taxes because they do not discourage saving.</p></blockquote>
<p>But you get the idea that he would not criticize the specific proposal from the gitgo:</p>
<blockquote><p>As I understand it, the so-called Fair Tax plan calls to raise a substantial fraction of U.S. federal tax revenue with a retail sales tax. It is one form of a consumption tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>My understanding is different in that the Boortz and Linder plan proposes to eliminate income taxes and put in its place a national sales tax that is not sufficient to fund the current level of Federal spending.  We also have Dr. Mankiw on record reasonably arguing that increasing Federal deficits tend to lower national savings and crowd-out investment.  Rather than directly addressing the Boortz/Linder tax plan, he suggests alternative ideas.  Nice dodge!</p>

<blockquote>Welfare caseloads have dropped 60 percent since the passage of welfare reform. Was that just the result of a strong economy? No. Caseloads didn’t decline significantly in any of the eight periods of economic expansion from the 1950s to the mid-1990s. From 1953 to 1994, the number of families on welfare dropped in only five of those years, and dropped two years in a row only once. By 2005, welfare caseloads had been declining for a stunning 11 straight years.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I read this, I had to think – aren’t caseloads a poor measure of poverty as they also reflect the proportion of poor people in these programs as opposed to be in dire poverty without government aid?  The <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/10-7-04tanf-stmt.htm">Center on Budget and Policy Priorities</a> noted a couple of years ago:<br />
<blockquote>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced today that caseloads in the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program fell below 2 million during the first quarter of 2004.  Echoing similar past press releases, Assistant Secretary Wade Horn claimed that “more Americans are leaving welfare, entering the workforce and becoming part of the economic mainstream.&#8221; “Contrary to HHS’s assertions, falling TANF caseloads in recent years have not meant that more families are working or out of poverty,” noted Sharon Parrott, the Center’s director of welfare reform policy.  “Earlier this year, shortly before the Census Bureau released data showing a marked rise in child poverty in the United States in 2003, HHS issued a similar press release that trumpeted TANF caseload declines in 2003.”  (Data on poverty are only available through 2003.) “While poverty did fall in the 1990s &#8211; as a result of a growing economy, increased supports for working poor families, and welfare reform efforts &#8211; poverty and joblessness among single mothers increased significantly between 2000 and 2003, data noticeably absent from the HHS press release,” said Parrott. “Contrary to Horn’s claim, rising poverty rates in recent years show that more families have left the economic mainstream rather than joined it.” “HHS is once again touting declining caseloads absent any research or data showing that this decline is the result of improving economic prospects for poor families,” said Parrott. “Effective welfare reform should help families join the economic mainstream by providing temporary income support, help finding and keeping jobs, and child care.  But to accomplish these goals, welfare programs have to respond to increases in the number of families who need help,” said Parrott.  “The decline in the number of families being helped by TANF, despite the increase in the number of families living in poverty in recent years, suggests that steps need to be taken to reduce barriers that keep needy families from benefiting from the benefits and services the TANF program can provide.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Figure 1 from the <a href="http://www.ncsl.org/statefed/welfare/caseloadwatch.htm">Welfare Caseload Watch</a> documents there was a decline in caseloads during the Clinton years that predated the passage of the 1996 act.  Caseloads have not materially changed since Bush took office:<br />
<blockquote>For most states, welfare caseloads have remained fairly stable, despite concerns over caseload increases during the recent economic downturn.  National caseloads have leveled off even in the midst of relatively high unemployment rates.  Some states have seen increases and others decreases, but overall, caseload numbers have not responded strongly to the weak economy.  NCSL&#8217;s Welfare Project is actively collecting welfare caseload information from state agencies to provide a national picture and analyze state trends.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jeffrey Grogger has authored a couple of papers of interest.  In <a href="http://www.spc.uchicago.edu/prc/pdfs/grogge05.pdf">Markov Forecasting Methods for Welfare Caseloads</a>, he notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Restoration Act (PRWORA) replaced AFDC with Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and changed the funding formula used to finance welfare expenditures. Whereas AFDC expenditures were shared between federal and state governments, TANF is funded with a block grant. This means that sufficient growth in TANF cases could force states to curtail eligibility, reduce benefits, reduce spending on other state programs, or raise taxes to support higher spending. Although the threat of such welfare-driven fiscal dislocations is currently low due to the high funding level of the TANF block grant, recent proposals to reduce the federal block grant could present states with difficult choices if caseloads were to rise substantially … In the simplest terms, today’s caseload depends on yesterday’s caseload plus entries and exits. Because today’s caseload depends in part on yesterday’s caseload, the caseload exhibits inertia. Markov forecasting exploits that inertia to base forecasts of the future caseload on current entries and exits. Put differently, current entries and exits affect current caseloads, but since today’s caseload affects future caseloads, current entries and exits affect future caseloads as well. If turnover is not too great, then there is a lag between changes in entries and exits and the time that those changes are fully reflected in the caseload. Thus current trends in entries and exits help predict future caseloads. Markov theory motivates a leading indicator that is based on entries and exits &#8230; The key trends in the entry and exit series discussed above are quite prominent. The smoothed ISS seems to fit quite well, even though it was computed indirectly from the smoothed entry and exit rate series rather than estimated It achieves its maximum value in January 1994, 14 months before the caseload peak in March 1995. It achieves its minimum value in November 2002, 12 months before the recent caseload minimum in November 2003 … The forecasts achieve their minimum value in January 2004, just two months after the caseload achieved its minimum value. furthermore, the forecasts strongly suggest that the November 2003 low point represents a true turning point, rather than just a relatively minor fluctuation around a stable level. After the beginning of 2004, the forecasted caseload rises sharply.</p></blockquote>
<p>Grogger’s data and Markov model shows that caseloads rose from 1989 to 1995 before they began their decline.  We know that poverty was already high during the 1980’s with the 1990 recession increasing poverty.  Groggery’s model suggests that changes in caseloads will lag changes in poverty and it suggests that caseloads will begin to rise given the recent increase in poverty.  Also, note that caseloads may decline because government assistance to the poor becomes more stingy.  </p>
<p>None of what Lowry writes has anything to do with the impact of the 1996 act on economic behavior.  Grogger’s <a href="http://www.soc.washington.edu/users/brines/grogger.pdf">The Effects of Time Limits, the EITC, and Other Policy Changes on Welfare Use, Work, and Income Among Female-headed Families</a> is more promising: </p>
<blockquote><p>Of all of the welfare reforms that were implemented during the 1990s, time limits may represent the single greatest break from past policy. This paper expands on what is known about this important welfare reform measure by exploiting the predictions from Grogger and Michalopoulos (2003) to estimate the effects of time limits on welfare use, employment, labor supply, earnings, and income among female-headed families. Results based on data from the March Current Population Survey suggest that time limits have had important effects on welfare use and work, accounting for about one-eighth of the decline in welfare use and about 7% of the rise in employment since 1993. They have had no significant effect on earnings or income, however. The analysis also shows that the collective effects of other reforms have had important impacts on employment and labor supply. Furthermore, it identifies the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) as a particularly important contributor to both the recent decrease in welfare use and the recent increase in employment, labor supply, and earnings.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The logic seems to run as follows: <br />1. Krugman advocates policies that would reduce the income of affluent people. <br />2. But Krugman is an affluent person. <br />3. Therefore, Krugman is being dishonest. <br />Huh? Are you dishonest if you want to reduce poverty, but aren&#8217;t poor yourself, and will probably end up paying taxes to support anti-poverty programs?</p></blockquote>
<p>While Dr. Samwick did not saw Dr. Krugman was being dishonest – given all the (false) allegations of Krugman dishonesty being hurled by the likes of Donald Luskin, I see can where Mark was coming from.  Mark’s ghost writing for Dr. Krugman later noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m sure that I earn a lot more than James Tobin did (I use him as an example because of how modest his lifestyle was), but it&#8217;s not because I&#8217;m a better economist; it&#8217;s the system that has changed.</p></blockquote>
<p>I will not even pretend I could ghost write for the author of <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/cwl/cwldpp/458.html">How Dead is Keynes</a>, but the calm and humor of the late James Tobin is surely needed here.  I suspect Dr. Tobin would find some funny opening line that would have the room calm down and listen to his usual wisdom.  I also suspect that he’d concede Dr. Samwick’s argument that education has something to do with earning – albeit it’s not the only factor.  And then he’d likely challenge Paulson’s contention that nothing could be done about “this trend”, which seems to be saying policy cannot address the wide disparity of educational opportunities.  After all, wasn’t a central theme in George W. Bush’s 2000 campaign for the White House that we must improve educational standards?  OK, President Bush’s actual policies fall woefully short of his promises six years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/08/an_interview_wi.html">Mark Thoma</a> treats us to a 1996 interview with <a href="http://minneapolisfed.org/pubs/region/96-12/tobin.cfm">James Tobin</a>. Dr. Tobin had some interesting comments about Social Security and minimum wages, and even politics.  It is not surprising that much of the interview addressed macroeconomics.  Mark and I were particularly drawn to Dr. Tobin’s comments about supply-side economics and other challenges in Keynesian thinking:<br />
<blockquote>I think Keynesian ideas are still what&#8217;s going on in practical economics. What guides the Federal Reserve mostly is mainstream Keynesian macroeconomics. I don&#8217;t see monetarism being of any practical use these days and I don&#8217;t see real business cycle theory being of any practical use any days, even though it occupies an inordinate amount of time of some very gifted people and their students. And supply-side economics, aside from the supply-side economics that is just ordinary microeconomics and growth economics, the supply-side economics that you might call &#8220;pop&#8221; supply-side economics which, unfortunately, was able to get a certain amount of authenticity in this most recent political campaign for an outrageous proposal by Sen. Dole, I don&#8217;t see any of that getting anywhere at all. So, Reaganomics, supply-side economics in that sense, Laffer curves, Jack Kemp stuff, alas the stuff that some very good economists were selling during the recent campaign, that&#8217;s nonsense and that&#8217;s certainly not getting us anywhere. So after you look at the other entries in the beauty contest, you come back to the natural evolution from 1936 to 1962. And isn&#8217;t it interesting that these guys who were so big on pushing all these fantasies, Lucas, Barro, Prescott, they&#8217;re not interested in business cycles anymore—not because they solved the problem, but because they didn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>If you look at their Table 6 (page 53), you can find their estimated date for the start of the recession: September 2000.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/08/the_2001_recess.html">Menzie Chinn</a> read the same paper and notes:<br />
<blockquote>First let me make the observation that while Mankiw prefers the multivariate Markov Switching results in Table 6 of Hamilton-Chauvet, it is by no means the only set of estimates in the paper. Table 8, using the recursive estimation methodology indicates a March 2001 recession date &#8211; exactly the determination of the NBER Business Cycle Committee.</p></blockquote>
<p>Menzie does a nice job of summarizing the paper co-authored by his co-blogger, but admits that we should ask Dr. Hamilton his view of to which methodology he finds more compelling.</p>

Matt writes:<br />
<blockquote>The war in Lebanon, as wars so often are, was the result of a serious double miscalculation. First, Hezbollah clearly failed to anticipate how Israel would respond to their cross-border raid. In turn, Israel clearly failed to anticipate how difficult it would be to mount a major anti-Hezbollah operation in Lebanon. And, indeed, the miscalculations were surely interlinked. Hezbollah correctly assessed how difficult it would be for Israel to mount a massive retaliation and therefore banked on Israel not retaliating massively. The resulting war was a disaster for both sides. Israel really was significantly hurting Hezbollah. But it was doing so at a massive cost to itself in terms of lives lost and money spent. Hezbollah was bound to start running low on rockets and Israel running low on things to bomb. The situation was heading in the direction of grinding, endless guerilla conflict that would have been exceedingly costly and essentially hopeless from the Israeli perspective while also imperiling everything Hezbollah&#8217;s built itself into in southern Lebanon. Each side had reason to regret the conflict&#8217;s existence. Both sides would have been made better off by calling &#8220;do over&#8221; and returning to the status quo ante. But neither side wanted to back down. Nor would it have been easy for either side to do so since the coalition Hezbollah/Syria/Iran team won&#8217;t negotiate with the Israel/USA coalition and vice versa. Enter France. In essence, through two consecutive bait-and-switches &#8211; first over the wording of a UN resolution, and second over the deployment of French troops to Lebanon &#8211; France managed to get both parties to agree to a return to the status quo ante, which is better for both sides (that&#8217;s why the tricks worked), but that neither side could admit to wanting. That&#8217;s a pretty good result, especially considering that Chirac spent essentially none of France&#8217;s resources achieving it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Matt but his two references to the “status quo ante” in bold.  I have to wonder – was Matt was directing his comments towards <a href="http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2006/70012.htm">Secretary Rice</a>?</p>

                                <p>It seems that <a href="http://www.noridianmedicare.com/lsredir.php?pdf=/provider/updates/docs/Nine%20Day%20Hold%20QandA.pdf">The Centers for Medicare &#038; Medicaid Services</a> have been ordered to delay certain payments until the next fiscal year begins:<br />
<blockquote>The Centers for Medicare &#038; Medicaid Services (CMS) has been instructed by the United States Congress in the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005, to place a brief hold on Medicare payments for ALL claims (e.g., initial claims, adjustment claims, and Medicare Secondary Payer (MSP) claims) for the last 9 days of the Federal fiscal year, i.e., September 22, 2006 through September 30, 2006.  Noridian Administrative Services (NAS) will release the held payments on Monday, October 2, 2006 including all payments that normally would be scheduled for release on that date.</p></blockquote>
<p>So please explain why a nine-day hold on Medicare payments has been ordered by Congress if – as has been claimed – the Federal government has done such a wonderful job at reducing the deficit.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/08/budget-missing-money.html">CalculatedRisk</a> spots more creative accounting:<br />
<blockquote>The non-Social Security off-budget expenditures have increased dramatically this year. My guess is the gap will be close to $160 Billion by the end of the fiscal year. Perhaps this is due to expenditure related to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita that might be off-budget. Or maybe this is a little Enron-style creative accounting. I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;d like to know.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>For the past 30 years, left-right debate over America’s wars has traveled a well-worn rut. The Left says whatever war is in question is “another Vietnam,” while the Right denies it. After three decades of being serially wrong, in the Iraq war liberals might be making their first-ever correct diagnosis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Lowry is finally say Iraq has become a second Vietnam.  Welcome to the Reality Based Community, Rich!  But you forget two things.  Some of us supported the wise way George H. W. Bush handled the 1991 Iraq issue.  But more importantly, some of us were saying back in 2002 that invading Iraq would lead to the lose, lose situation we are in now and would be seen by Osama bin Laden as a “gift from God”.  So our diagnosis was correct back then – and yours was horribly wrong.</p>
