                                <p>Let’s go back a bit to when <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/wall-street-journal-declares-there-is.html">we</a> and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/08/there_is_too_a_.html">Mark Thoma</a> ridiculed a <a href="http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users2&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB115508135412330481.html">WSJ oped</a> for arguing there was no short-term Phillips curve trade-off.  Now let’s review the latest nonsense from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTZjYjk0ZjM4YTM0YTY5YjkzN2RkMTViMjk1ZTdhZTM=">John Tamny</a>: <br />
<blockquote>While U.S. businesses access worldwide capacity and labor pools, the Fed (at least publicly) persists in viewing the U.S. economy as a closed one &#8211; one with static amounts of labor and capacity that do not change in response to shifts in the economic landscape.  Rather than letting market prices such as gold guide management of the dollar, today’s Fed seemingly follows an “economy rule,” whereby it will raise its target interest rate when backward-looking government indicators of growth suggest economic strength, and cut rates when those same indicators suggest weakness… In defense of Ben Bernanke, it was his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, who resurrected the Phillips curve in the late 1990s with frequent commentary suggesting the “economy could overheat” if “demand growth persists or strengthens.” Stocks have been flat since then in nominal terms, and in real terms they are even weaker.</p></blockquote>
<p>While both the WSJ oped pages and Tamny ridicule the concept of the short-term Phillips curve, they have contradictory complaints about monetary policy.  The WSJ crowd wants even tighter monetary policy – whereas Tamny is arguing that monetary policy is too tight.  While I’m a bit concerned with the tightness of our current monetary policy, I’m sure glad it is being run by folks like Ben Bernanke than the inconsistent idiots of the rightwing.</p>

                                <p>If I were a Democratic 2008 hopeful, I might say “bring it on” to the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/08/16/news/companies/walmart_politics/index.htm?cnn=yes">Wake Up Wal-Mart</a> campaign:<br />
<blockquote>NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) &#8211; Wal-Mart Stores is hitting back at some leading Democratic presidential hopefuls who have joined with the company&#8217;s critics recently. The world&#8217;s largest retailer announced it is sending out what it terms a &#8220;voter education guide&#8221; to its 18,000 Iowa employees, criticizing politicians who have recently joined with the union-backed group &#8220;Wake Up Wal-Mart&#8221; for a series of rallies. Iowa holds the nation&#8217;s first presidential caucus, and potential candidates are already visiting the state.</p></blockquote>
<p>Footnote: Actually, I should have said Wal-Mart&#8217;s attempt to counter Wake Up Wal-Mart.  That&#8217;s what I get for posting when I first wake up on the West Coast!</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Martin A. Sullivan – who writes for some very good articles for Tax Analyst – had been making a major issue of the following:<br />
<blockquote>Moving profits from the United States to low-tax jurisdictions is the way prosperous U.S. pharmaceutical companies keep their taxes low. And that domestic-to-foreign shift has clearly accelerated in recent years. By Tax Analysts&#8217; calculations, in 1999 foreign profits accounted for 39.2 percent of worldwide profits of large U.S. drug companies. By 2005 that percentage had jumped to 69.9 percent … When one affiliate of a multinational corporation makes a sale or loan to another affiliate, profits are shifted. When the terms of the transactions are set so that affiliates in low-tax countries get the better deals, the low-tax affiliates get larger shares of the profits and the multinational group reduces its overall income tax burden … Pharmaceutical companies own a lot of marketing intangibles and patents that are developed in one or just a few locations and then used worldwide. Determining fair terms for interaffiliate transactions involving intangible assets involves a great deal of subjective judgment, so those determinations are a constant source of conflict between drug companies and the IRS. The data strongly suggest the IRS is losing the battle.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the point made by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/economists-enabling-tax-cheats-why.html">David Cay Johnson</a> in his chapter entitled Letters to Switzerland.  I know we Angrybears have made the general point before as has Martin Sullivan.  I just wanted to thank Mr. Sullivan for reminding us again.</p>

                                <p>I have a bad habit of biting my nails but I’m not flexible enough to bite my ankles even if <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjIxNDVlYmZhZjI4ODk3ZDMzMjViZjdhMTE3NjMwZjA=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> suggests:<br />
<blockquote>Ankle-biting, demand-side Keynesians (most of whom reside in the Democratic party) are always looking for blotches, hanging toenails, and the occasional scrape on what is today’s muscular and statuesque American economic body. But the genial and optimistic Mr. Reagan undoubtedly chuckles from his perch on high, as he watches his critics scramble to come up with a coherent opposing idea. They can’t, and they won’t. One of Reagan’s big ideas was that tax incentives matter. It has been a blockbuster, runaway success. But even today, twenty-five years later, it remains the greatest economic story never told.</p></blockquote>
<p>His evidence that supply-side economics produces miracles?  That the economy has grown by about 3.5% per year over the past 25 years.  Never mind that the economy grew by the same rate the quarter of a century before the 1981 tax cut.  Never mind the fact that economic growth averaged only 3% during the Reagan-Bush41 period and only 2.6% under Bush43.  Yes, it was that 3.7% growth during the Clinton years that kept the overall average near 3.5%.  And supply-siders claimed the 1993 tax increase would lead to low economic growth.  </p>
<blockquote><p>But what was the rational for the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts?  Try Keynesian aggregate demand stimulus.  One of the rationales for the 1981 tax cut was also Keynesian aggregate demand stimulus.  But Kudlow did had a new tidbit to his usual nonsense:<br />Over the past 3 months core sales rose 6.7 percent at annual rate, and in the past year they’re up 7.4 percent. Excluding autos alone, sales have gained 9.2 percent in the last 12 months. That’s big time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Core sales excluding autos?  What is Kudlow including?  We know he usually excludes government purchases and net exports preferring to include only consumption and certain kinds of investment such as business investment.  Is he including or excluding residential investment?  Let’s review the facts.  BEA shows the sum of consumption and investment in terms of 2000$ to have been $9967 billion as of 2006QI and $10,025 billion as of 2006QII.  This increase is nowhere close to 6.7%.  The fall in residential investment may be part of the issue here, but I suspect Kudlow is using nominal increases rather than real increases – AGAIN.</p>
<p>We should also note that real motor vehicle output was only $417 billion as of 2006QII as compared to $447 billion as of 2005QIII.  This is not good news so sunny Larry decides to exclude this sector as well as the residential investment sector.  To exclude the statistics of sectors that are declining is dishonest.  To report nominal growth rather than real growth is dishonest.  But this is what it takes for Kudlow to write an upbeat story about recent economic growth for the National Review aka Dishonesty R Us.  </p>
<p>Since I do have a hanging toenail, I need to practice my yoga so that one day I can actually bite it!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The claim that real GDP growth averaged 3.5% per year over the quarter of a century from 1981 to 2005 struck me as a bit off so I compared real GDP at the end of 2005 ($11,163.8 billion) to real GDP at the end of 1980 ($5202.1 billion) and it seems real GDP had grown by 131.7%, which translates into an average annual growth rate of 3.1% and not the 3.5% rate Kudlow claimed.  Even if one uses 2006QII versus 1981QII (notice real GDP fell during the second quarter of Reagan’s first term), real GDP was only 116.2% higher, which translates into an average growth rate of only 3.13%.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Was Ken Mehlman auditioning to become the anchor on the <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml">Colbert Report</a> during last segment of today’s <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14273400">Meet the Press</a>.  David Gregory set up Mehlman by noting: (a) Mehlman had praised Lieberman as believing in a strong national defense (Mehlman was trying to paint the rest of us Democrats as not caring about security); and (b) noting some of Lieberman’s criticisms of the ineptitude of the Bush Administration in handling post invasion Iraq.  So was this a joke:<br />
<blockquote>Look, the fact is that our mission in the war in Iraq is critical. We agree on that; we agree it’s wrong to cut and run. But look, we’re not coming in and saying “Stay the course.” The choice in this election is not between “Stay the course” and “Cut and run,” it’s between “Win by adapting” and “Cut and run.” Let me tell you what we’re doing. The fact is, before the successful Iraqi elections, the number of troops went up from 137,000 to 167,000. That’s adapting to win. Recently, the increased troops in Baghdad, adapting to win. We changed how the training of Iraqi forces occurred to involve more Iraqis. That’s adapting to win.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why did the Bush Administration stay the course for three years and only recently decide to adapt to win?  Could it be that they are trailing in the polls for our November 2006 elections?  Of course, they are not adapting their strategy of smearing Democrats as weak on national security.  </p>
<p>More jokes from comedian Mehlman:<br />
<blockquote>But every one of the points you mentioned &#8211; North Korea successfully tested six missiles. The people want to vote for Democratic leaders who have been against missile defense. You mentioned Iran, Harry Reid said we should take the use of force off the table. How are we going to be able to negotiate and prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon &#8211; which Chairman Dean is right, is a terrible thing if it happens &#8211; if they don’t think force is a possibility?</p></blockquote>
<p>The previous Administration relied on a strategy of diplomacy where we told Iran and North Korea that there would be severe consequences if they built nuclear weapons.  That way we would not have to rely on shooting down a nuclear missile.  The Bush Administration’s lack of diplomacy leads to nuclear missiles being developed by North Korea and Mehlman wants to rely on Star Wars to shoot them down?  Never mind, we’ve been trying to develop such a defense for a generation to no avail.  Now we have to rely on this pipe dream to prevent the infamous “mushroom cloud”?  I don’t know whether to laugh or cry.  </p>
<p>But the real joke was how Mehlman opened his interview:<br />
<blockquote>If you listen to what Osama bin Laden says, if you listen to what Mr. Zawahiri says, they both say their goal is to drive America out of Iraq the way we were driven out of Vietnam and to use that as a base to launch further attacks. They’ve said what their goal is if there’s a failed state sitting in between Syria and Iran.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would not have been a failed state open to the likes of Al Qaeda had the White House listened to John Dean and many others who warned going into Iraq in the first place was a mistake.  But yes, we now have a lose, lose situation thanks to that stupid decision on March 19, 2003.  Go back and read what Howard Dean said this morning about the need to address this nightmare in the right way – since obviously Ken Mehlman failed to listen to Mr. Dean’s comments as he was too busy rehearsing his dishonest talking points.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: With a hat tip to Judd who notes that <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/08/13/kristol-cheneys-claim">Bill Kristol</a> gives Ken Mehlman some real competition as joker of the week:<br />
<blockquote>The Bush administration, I think, is deeply correct about this. And what you do on one front affects what happens on the other front. Cheney’s statement is indisputably correct. It doesn’t mean that Ned Lamont likes al Qaeda or wants al Qaeda to win. But the notion that a retreat in Iraq would not embolden terrorists elsewhere in the Middle East, and terror recruiters in the suburbs of London, is ludicrous. Of course it would. Now, if you want to say we should get out of Iraq anyway because we can’t win and this is the price we have to pay, fine.</p></blockquote>
<p>No Billie boy – getting into Iraq is what was deemed by Osama bin Laden to be his “gift from God”.  But you are correct – what we did on the Iraq “front” on March 19, 2003 did have a catastrophic effect on the “other front” – the real GWOT.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/13/washington/13bush.html&#038;OQ=_rQ3D1&#038;OP=5c326eb5Q2FzDZEzQ5EQ24bTQ3BQ24Q24Q3Aizi77(z7ozQ60Q2BzDQ5CTx0qQ5BQ3AQ24qzQ60Q2BEmTxWxQ3A)Q2F">Jim Rutenberg</a> exposes the “Defeatocrats memo” penned by Fox News spokesperson (or was it White House press secretary) Tony Snow:<br />
<blockquote>The entire effort was swiftly coordinated by the Republican National Committee and the White House, using the same political machinery that carried them to victory in 2004. It began in the days before the anticipated loss of Mr. Lieberman, a staunch supporter of the war in Iraq, to Ned Lamont, a vocal war critic whose victory Republicans used to paint Democrats as “Defeatocrats.” That word originated in a White House memorandum by Mr. Bush’s press secretary, Tony Snow, suggesting ways to frame the debate, that was shared with officials, including Ken Mehlman, the Republican chairman, and Karl Rove, the president’s top strategist &#8230; The plan came together at the same time that Mr. Bush and his top security aides, as well as Vice President Dick Cheney, were being intensively briefed on the unfolding British investigation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see – a plot to kill thousands of American and British citizens – and all these demagogues can think of as how to (dishonestly) smear Democrats as Al Qaeda sympathizers.  How did we ever let such clowns into the White House in the first place?  Hat tip to <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/08/13/spin-me/#more-3968">Christy Hardin Smith</a> who adds:<br />
<blockquote>the US rushed Britain on arrests in the terrorism bust from last week, that came on the heels of the Lieberman loss.   Hmmm…anyone think that the CT referendum against Joe Lieberman and his support of the &#8220;Stay the Failing Course&#8221; Bush Presidency had anything to do with the push on this?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Unfortunately, some have suggested recently that the terrorist threat is being used for partisan political advantage. We can have legitimate disagreements about the best way to fight the terrorists, yet there should be no disagreement about the dangers we face.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the President is saying this should not be a partisan issue &#8211; I agree 100%.  Alas, it seems that the GOP strategy for 2006 is the same one that they used in 2002 and 2004 as <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/08/10/terror.politics/index.html">Bill Schneider</a> suggests:<br /><strong><br />

<blockquote>People in Asia work the longest hours – almost 50 days more per year than Western Europeans. Asian workers at least partially compensate for low purchasing power through longer working hours &#8230; Seoul has the highest, Paris the lowest working hours. Asian employees can at least partially compensate for low hourly wages through longer hours spent at work &#8230; An analysis of the historical data produced by the UBS Study of Prices and Earnings, shows that Europeans have reduced their working hours in the last 30 years in favor of more leisure time.</p></blockquote>
<p>French real per capita GDP is near $30,000 per year, while South Korean real per capita GDP is around $20,000 per year.  In other words, we may have evidence (as UBS notes) of the income effect in action.  It seems a certain rightwing <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2006/08/lazy-faire.html">troll</a> did not bother to read the UBS discussion before accusing the French of being lazy.</p>

                                <p>For some reason <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGEzYmE2NDYwMDJlMWI4ZjIxNDNhM2I0MDA2ZDJlNTc=">Jerry Bowyer</a> has decided to SwiftBoat Warren Buffet.  Bowyer seems to be mad that Buffet has criticized <a href="http://www.dca.nic.in/naresh/naresh_second/annex_6.htm">corporate greed</a> and accuses Buffet of being guilty of making <a href="http://www.buffettsecrets.com/berkshire-hathaway.htm">good business decisions</a>. The mixed-up mind of Fuzzcharts was evident in his opening paragraph:<br />
<blockquote>Last Saturday, when Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway company revealed that its boffo first quarter was due partly to high returns from its investment in corporate jets, the cycle of irony was finally complete.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me type slowly for the mentally challenged Mr. Bowyer.  Buffet’s company was selling products at a profit with some of the buyers being corporations whose decisions were made by executives not maximizing shareholder value.  Had Buffet’s company choose not to sell products in high demand – it would not be maximizing its shareholder value.</p>
<p>Of course, we see at the end that Mr. Bowyer’s real problem with Warren Buffet is that Mr. Buffet is not stupid enough to endorse the National Review’s incessant supply-side stupidity.</p>

                                <p>The plot in Great Britain to blow up a bunch of airplanes flying from the UK to the US attracts another rightwing stupid comment – this time from the <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110008785">WSJ oped</a> pages:<br />
<blockquote>Meanwhile, British antiterrorism chief Peter Clarke said at a news conference that the plot was foiled because &#8220;a large number of people&#8221; had been under surveillance, with police monitoring &#8220;spending, travel and communications.&#8221; Let&#8217;s emphasize that again: The plot was foiled because a large number of people were under surveillance concerning their spending, travel and communications. Which leads us to wonder if Scotland Yard would have succeeded if the ACLU or the New York Times had first learned the details of such surveillance programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Aha says <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/031892.php">Glenn Reynolds</a>! So this means that President Bush is correct that we must trash our Constitution and our liberties to be safe – right?  <a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2006/08/today-in-fake-libertarianism.html">Not so fast</a> says one blogger pointing to <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/theplank?pid=30857">Spencer Ackerman</a>: <br />
<blockquote>it&#8217;s worth pointing out one key difference between the British way and the new American way of surveillance: Barring some unforeseen and massively scandalous revelation, British investigators, in all cases, have to obtain and comply with court-issued warrants for any surveillance. This week&#8217;s counter-terrorism success should demonstrate how possible it is, and remains, for open-society to combat jihadism while preserving the rule of law. In fact, let&#8217;s take that a step further. According to a U.S. intelligence official cited by the Post, some of the British terrorists placed phone calls to individuals within the United States. Whoever they called should very obviously be placed under surveillance. The FISA court would undoubtedly agree, despite Bush&#8217;s protests that successful counter-terrorism surveillance has to occur outside the restrictions of FISA. In short: counter-terrorism success, vigilance, the rule of law, and you &#8211; perfect together.</p></blockquote>
<p>This week has been dominated by rightwingers telling us Democrats that opposing the Iraq War leads to more terrorist dangers, which of course, is perfectly backwards as our arrogance and incompetence during the invasion and occupation of Iraq took a beaten down and clueless Al Qaeda &#8211; clueless after they plan to suck us into a protracted US boots-on-the-ground civil war in Afghanistan utterly failed – more than they could have ever hoped for, but this time in Iraq.  </p>
<p>President Bush is down in Crawford cutting down trees or whatever as <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2006/aug/12/dems_better_explot_uk_terrorist_plot_or_theyll_lose">M. J. Rosenberg</a> comments on the political implications of what the New York Times noted:<br />
<blockquote>The most frightening thing about the foiled plot to use liquid explosives to blow up airplanes over the Atlantic is that both the government and the aviation industry have been aware of the liquid bomb threat for years but have done little to prepare for it. What saved everyone was apparently superb intelligence work by the British, who apprehended the terrorists before they could carry out their scheme. It is unlikely that any of the scanning machines or screening personnel deployed at airports would have detected the potentially destructive materials before they could be carried aboard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rosenberg continues:<br />
<blockquote>In other words, the Bush administration is not even meeting the bare requirements of fighting a war on terrorism: arming us to fight technologies they know are out there and which terrorists will use to kill us. It&#8217;s just like it&#8217;s ignoring the container ship issue. I wonder how many other of these technologies are out there which DHS knows about and does nothing to thwart. This is a natural issue for the Dems to use in the fall. But I see no evidence they will. As other posters have written, the Dems have allowed the GOP to own the terrorism issue. Most of them (not all) shrink from criticizing the administration on this because they are scared. In their hearts, they think the Repubs are more credible on terrorism so they keep quiet. That is why Bush never had to answer for being asleep at the switch on 9/11. And it&#8217;s why the GOP, and not the Dems, are likely to benefit in November from exposure of the UK plot. To put it simply. If Dems allow the GOP to use the terrorist issue against them, they do not deserve to control Congress or the White House. My guess, the Dems run and hide and the party responsible for US unpreparedness in the face of terrorism successfully uses the issue against Democrats.  If that happens, we will know that it is third party time.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Bush White House ignored the Al Qaeda threat during the summer of 2001.  Since then, the Bush White House has demonized Democrats for being soft on terror as they do precious little.  Thank God, the UK government is not so utterly incompetent.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/08/after_london.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> whines we Democrats have no plan.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_08/009331.php">Kevin Drum</a> could have gone insane over such stupidity, but thankfully, he noted the Democrats do have a plan very similar to what Andrew Sullivan would recommend.  I’d hate to accuse Mr. Sullivan of dishonesty, so let’s just chalk this one up on the possibility that he is as clueless now as Condi Rice was five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/national/1155AP_Terror_Explosives_Detection.html">John Solomon</a> reports:<br />
<blockquote>As the British terror plot was unfolding, the Bush administration quietly tried to take away $6 million that was supposed to be spent this year developing new explosives detection technology. Congressional leaders rejected the idea, the latest in a series of Homeland Security Department steps that have left lawmakers and some of the department&#8217;s own experts questioning the commitment to create better anti-terror technologies.  Homeland Security&#8217;s research arm, called the Sciences &#038; Technology Directorate, is a &#8220;rudderless ship without a clear way to get back on course,&#8221; Republican and Democratic senators on the Appropriations Committee declared recently.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess the White House’s priorities are such that this $6 million could have been better spent for pork barrel spending to prop up Republican Congressional candidates.  Hat tip to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/">Think Progress</a>.</p>

                                <p>You might find the latest garbage from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTlmZDYxZDJhZDJlMTQ2NGVmZmI0OTFmMGMzOGRjZmQ=&#038;c=1">Andrew McCarthy</a> to be simply nothing more than a small bag in the heap of garbage coming from the neocons this week:<br />
<blockquote>We are reading only about 24 arrests today. If we were already in the heralded antiwar world of Ned Lamont and the war-against-the-war crowd, it could be much different. We could just as easily be reading about ten jumbo jets exploded out of the sky. Or 3,000 murdered innocents &#8211; mostly American and British citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>To me, it’s just down right comical.  His title talked about London and Connecticut, which I trust he could find on a map.  But I doubt he could figure out the distance between Baghdad (as in the invasion of Saddam Hussein’s Iraq that Lamont and many Americans now realize was a gift to Al Qaeda) and the border region between Afghanistan and Pakistan where these wannabe terrorists trained.  McCarthy, however, continued with some oldie but moldie rightwing talking points:<br />
<blockquote>The antiwar Left has a conveniently flexible moral compass. Consequently, the Clinton era Echelon program was fine, but Bush’s NSA Terrorist Surveillance Program is an impeachable offense. Mishandling classified information by a Clinton CIA director was worthy of a pardon, and destroying classified information (and lying to investigators about it) by a former Clinton national-security adviser was worthy of a pass, but leaking the unremarkable fact that Valerie Plame worked for the CIA is the crime of the century. Bombing Kosovo without U.N. approval was a moral imperative; invading Iraq after over a dozen U.N. resolutions is a violation of international law. Renditions conducted between 1994 and 2000 were just good national-security sense; renditions conducted between 2001 and 2006 are war crimes. Indicting Osama bin Laden in 1998 and then doing nothing to capture him while he bombed two American embassies and an American naval destroyer, killing hundreds, was aggressive yet intelligently modulated counterterrorism; allowing Osama bin Laden to evade capture in Tora Bora while killing and capturing hundreds of his operatives and decimating his hierarchy is irresponsibly incompetent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s take this one by one.  Is McCarthy trying to say that the outing of a CIA operative as well as her team that was trying to ascertain information about Iran’s nuclear capabilities something that assisted the UK in catching these wannabe terrorists?  And yes – Kosovo was a war that the rightwing opposed.  After all, genocide in Europe is AOK with Andrew McCarthy.  Incidentally, the dishonest case for war in 2002 did not include as its primary motive any allegations that Saddam was engaged in ongoing genocide.  </p>
<p>But I am glad that Mr. McCarthy is hoping we can one day bring Osama bin Laden to justice – since it was the incompetence of the Bush Administration that allowed bin Laden to evade capture in Tora Bora.  It’s just a shame that this White House took their eye off of going after Al Qaeda since then to focus on Iraq.</p>
