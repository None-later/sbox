                                <p>Regular Angry Bear readers will (hopefully?) have noticed that I haven&#8217;t been writing  regularly for quite some time.  Well&#8230; I&#8217;m back.  However, while I will be posting occasionally on Angry Bear, most of my day-to-day writing will now be on my new blog, <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/">The Street Light</a>.  From the blog&#8217;s <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2006/10/welcome-to-street-light.html">first post</a>:<br />
<blockquote>For about two and a half years, I was one of the principal writers on the blog Angry Bear, writing about economics and politics. It is a great blog, and I had lots of fun with my excellent coauthors trying to keep up with current news in economics and politics in the US. During my time as a principal writer at Angry Bear we saw it all, from the ridiculous to the sublime. True, the ridiculous moments seemed far more common, but oh well.</p>
<p>Then, I was forced to take a bit of hiatus from blogging by the demands of the rest of my life. Yah, it’s that old “real life” excuse: jobs, moving, family, and so forth. It turns out that those things can take up quite a bit of time, if you actually pay attention to them. But now I’m now ready to put all of that behind me and get back to blogging again.</p></blockquote>
<p>I realize that this move is a risky one; on Angry Bear, I&#8217;ve always been able to hide behind the fact that it wasn&#8217;t exclusively my blog.  Now I will have no such excuse&#8230;</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/news/15765751.htm">Richard Pombo</a>, who is a Republican Congressman from Stockton, wants to subsidize certain oil production: <br />
<blockquote>Tucked into a massive energy bill that would open the outer continental shelf to oil drilling are provisions that would slash future royalties owed to the federal government by companies prospecting in Rocky Mountain oil shale deposits. Sponsored by Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Stockton, and passed by the House earlier this year, the bill would amend an existing requirement that the federal government receive a “fair return” from oil companies that hold oil shale leases on public lands. Instead, Pombo&#8217;s bill would reduce royalties from the customary 12.5 percent of annual revenue to 1 percent … The provision would benefit the energy industry, which is a heavy contributor to Pombo&#8217;s re-election campaign.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Duncan Black</a> for discovering Pombo’s <a href="http://www.tbo.com/news/nationworld/MGB293FYATE.html">excuse</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Pombo stands by his provision, a spokesman said.  &#8220;The chairman and the majority of the members of the [House Resources] committee feel that it is the right thing to do because it is such a massive resource that it could provide relief for consumers and strengthen our economy,&#8221; Pombo aide Brian Kennedy said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The good news is that President Bush and certain Senate Republicans are not so sure that they wish to support Pombo’s proposal.  But let’s discuss the economics of providing below market rates to government owned resources.  Sure, it would tend to give a little more incentive to oil production.  But don’t higher oil prices already give incentives to develop these resources?  Pombo is pretending that the incidence of these subsidies will most accrue to consumers rather than suppliers.  In other words, he is assuming that the elasticity of the supply curve exceeds the elasticity of the demand curve.  But suppose that the elasticity of the supply curve is low – as depicted in the diagram drawn by <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/04/more_political.html">James Hamilton</a>.   <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=042806F">Arnold Kling</a> provides a verbal discussion in his “Energy Policy for Idiots”:<br />
<blockquote>Who would benefit from a short-term suspension of the 18.4-cent-per-gallon retail gasoline tax? Probably not the American consumer. The biggest beneficiary might be Iran.  In the short run, the supply of gasoline is fairly inelastic. Current inventories of crude oil and refined products are fairly difficult to adjust, so that the supply of gasoline is what it is. That is why it is pretty certain that drivers face a &#8220;tough summer,&#8221; in the words of the President. If the supply of gasoline is what it is, then the price of gasoline will be whatever it takes to limit demand to meet the supply. If that means $3.00 a gallon, then consumers are going to end up paying $3.00 per gallon, no matter what the tax is on gasoline. (Note: this analysis applies only in the very short run. In the long run, supply is elastic, so that some of a tax cut would be passed through to consumers.)  If the tax cut on gasoline will not be passed through to consumers, then where will it go? It will go to oil suppliers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Subsidies are similar to reduction in tax rates.  So what is Congressman’s Pombo’s evidence on the long-run elasticity for demand and for supply?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/10/barone-on-john-edwards.html">Greg Mankiw</a> points us to a criticism of John Edwards from <a href="http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/baroneblog/archives/061012/mark_warner_bow.htm#more">Michael Barone</a>:<br />
<blockquote>His shtick on how many Americans live in poverty is going to wear thin. His stump speech includes a line about a little girl whose parents couldn&#8217;t afford a winter coat. Give me a break. You can buy a little girl&#8217;s winter coat at Wal-Mart for $10. That&#8217;s the price of taking the little girl out to lunch at McDonald&#8217;s. As Juan Williams points out in his book Enough: The Phony Leaders, Dead-End Movements, and Culture of Failure That Are Undermining Black America—and What We Can Do About It, no one in America is stuck in poverty if he or she does three things: graduates from high school; gets a job, any job; refrains from having children before getting married. Poverty comes not from any structural failure of society but from dysfunctional behaviors. Edwards&#8217;s poverty shtick is a crock.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg notes:<br />
<blockquote>Barone fails to mention that we have textile and clothing imports to thank for all those cheap coats.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of his readers writes:<br />
<blockquote>If any of you looked at the Walmart website, a warm girl&#8217;s winter jacket costs 20 dollars (19.82). It&#8217;s possible that the website doesn&#8217;t have some items that they sell in stores, however let&#8217;s agree that 20 dollars is a non-neglible sum of money.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether the coat costs $10 or $20, the cost of paying rent, buying food, paying for health care and so forth are not free.  To suggest that the only reason people are poor is dysfunctional behavior suggests to me that Mr. Barone has little right to criticize John Edwards.</p>
<p>Update: It seems <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/10/dysfunctional_b.html">Brad DeLong</a> was also annoyed by Barone’s oped.  One point about Greg’s free trade comment, wouldn’t it be ironic if it turns out the girl’s father lost a job to foreign competition.  One reason why Senators from the Carolinas – such as John Edwards and Lindsey Graham – are not free traders is that the demand for Carolina manufactured apparel was reduced by the elimination of the Multifibre Agreement  quotas.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2006/10/michael_barones.html">Brendan Nyhan</a> says Barone does not understand relative pricing.  Michael Barone thought that the relative price of that coat was one McDonald’s Happy Meal.  Brendan writes:<br />
<blockquote>But Brad DeLong writes that &#8220;neither Greg nor Barone shops at Wal-Mart often enough to know or surfs on over to the Wal-Mart web site to learn what girls&#8217; winter quotes actually cost,&#8221; pointing out that the winter coats at Walmart.com actually cost $20-$35. Along the same lines, has Barone ever eaten at McDonald&#8217;s? Two people can eat lunch there for way less than $10.</p></blockquote>
<p>If that coat costs $30 and a Happy Meal costs $3, then the relative price of that coats is ten meals not one.  Heck, for the price of one coat, the girl’s mom could buy herself a meal, and buy another for eight of the girl’s friends!  Is Mr. Barone buying tattered used coats and using the rest of his money to purchase a hamburger at some fancy restaurant?</p>

John Cowperthwaite’s passing earlier this year was noted in <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/01/25/db2501.xml&#038;sSheet=/portal/2006/01/25/ixportal.html">this tribute</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Sir John Cowperthwaite, who died on January 21 aged 90, was Financial Secretary of Hong Kong throughout the 1960s; his extreme laissez-faire economic policies created conditions for very rapid growth, laying the foundations of the colony&#8217;s prosperity as an international business centre. Cowperthwaite was a classical free-trader in the tradition which stretched from Adam Smith to John Stuart Mill and Gladstone, rather than a modern monetarist. He was also a seasoned colonial administrator, with a strong streak of common sense. But his achievement in Hong Kong was hailed by Milton Friedman and other free-market economists as a shining example of the potency of laissez-faire when carried through to its logical conclusions in almost every aspect of government. The Right-wing American commentator PJ O&#8217;Rourke called Cowperthwaite &#8220;a master of simplicities&#8221;. Cowperthwaite himself called his approach &#8220;positive non-intervention&#8221;. Personal taxes were kept at a maximum of 15 per cent; government borrowing was wholly unacceptable; there were no tariffs or subsidies. Red tape was so reduced that a new company could be registered with a one-page form.  Cowperthwaite believed that government should concern itself with only minimal intervention on behalf of the most needy, and should not interfere in business.</p></blockquote>
<p>Free trade and low taxes as the engine of growth for Hong Kong has certainly been a theme of <a href="http://www.hooverdigest.org/983/friedman.html">Dr. Friedman</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Take the fifty-year experiment in economic policy provided by Hong Kong between the end of World War II and this past July, when Hong Kong reverted to China … Nonetheless, there are some statistics, and in 1960, the earliest date for which I have been able to get them, the average per capita income in Hong Kong was 28 percent of that in Great Britain; by 1996, it had risen to 137 percent of that in Britain. In short, from 1960 to 1996, Hong Kong’s per capita income rose from about one-quarter of Britain’s to more than a third larger than Britain’s … I believe that the only plausible explanation for the different rates of growth is socialism in Britain, free enterprise and free markets in Hong Kong. Has anybody got a better explanation? I’d be grateful for any suggestions.</p></blockquote>
<p>With such a kind invitation – how could one resist?  Hong Kong is often referred to as an entrepôt economy with the term entrepôt referring to trading centers that generate significant profits.  Sure, Hong Kong believed in free trade but my point is that it was able to thrive in large part because of certain restrictions to free trade between nations such as China and the U.S.  While Hong Kong had been a trading center even before the British established it as a crown colony, its livelihood as an entrepôt was diminished by the UN embargo against trade with China as a result of the Korean War.  Hong Kong in response moved to establish its own industries.  Hong Kong’s role as entrepôt, however, revived over time and was discussed by <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/W8088">Robert C. Feenstra  and Gordon H. Hanson</a> in <em>Intermediaries in Entrepôt Trade: Hong Kong Re-Exports of Chinese Goods</em>:<br />
<blockquote>In this paper, we examine Hong Kong&#8217;s role in intermediating trade between China and the rest of the world. Hong Kong distributes a large fraction of China&#8217;s exports. Net of customs, insurance, and freight charges, re-exports of Chinese goods are much more expensive when they leave Hong Kong than when they enter. Hong Kong markups on re-exports of Chinese goods are higher for differentiated products, products with higher variance in export prices, products sent to China for further processing, and products shipped to countries which have less trade with China. These results are consistent with quality-sorting models of intermediation and with the outsourcing of production tasks from Hong Kong to China. Additional results suggest that Hong Kong traders price discriminate across destination markets and use transfer pricing to shift income from high-tax countries to Hong Kong.</p></blockquote>
<p>The authors noted that the ratio of total trade to GDP for Hong Kong in 1998 was 259% and that the average markup on Hong Kong re-exports of Chinese goods was 24%.  In other words, a significant portion of Hong Kong’s GDP comes from entrepôt trade.  The authors often various explanation for these very high markup on trade:<br />
<blockquote>One compelling hypothesis is that Hong Kong traders have an informational advantage in trade between China and the rest of the world &#8230; In their role as middlemen, traders may earn informational rents, which could account for the markups they charge &#8230; Many firms that import goods from China forre-export engage in outward processing. Before importing goods from China, they may purchase raw materials on the world market, process these materials in Hong Kong or elsewhere, and export the unfinished goods to China for yet further processing … Quality sorting and outward processing are often complementary activities and we attempt to control for this in our empirical work. We also control for other behavior which may influence re-export activity, including transfer pricing, circumventing trade barriers, and hubbing in international shipping &#8230; higher for products subject to Multi-Fiber Arrangement (MFA) quotas; and higher for products shipped to countries with higher corporate tax rates. These last two results suggest that firms may use re-exporting to transfer income from abroad to the low-tax jurisdiction of Hong Kong.</p></blockquote>
<p>The role of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement was discussed years ago by <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/1003.html">Kala Krishna and Ling Hui Tang</a> in a paper entitled <em>Rent-sharing in the multi-fibre arrangement : evidence from U.S. &#8211; Hong Kong trade in apparel</em>.  The authors described an active market in selling valuable quota rights.  Like Feenstra  and Hanson wonder if the rents from these quotas might be exaggerated by creative transfer pricing, we have also suggested <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/failure-to-enforce-tax-laws.html">similar motivations</a>. <a href="http://www2.gsb.columbia.edu/faculty/rfisman/hk%20entrepot%20trade%201-18-05.pdf">Raymond Fisman, Peter Moustakerski, and Shang-Jin Wei</a> in <em>Offshoring Tariff Evasion: Evidence from Hong Kong as Entrepôt Trader</em> take the argument further by arguing that one of the reason why Hong Kong is a source for so much trade is the ability to evade tariffs.   While the end of the Multi-Fiber Arrangement and other movements towards free trade may be good news for the world economy, such movements would tend to reduce Hong Kong’s advantages as entrepôt traders.</p>

                                <p>Like most of us, I like to think I’m unbiased, or at least that I’ve arrived at my biases in a logical manner. In other words, I like to think that my biases are shaped by the data, and not that my interpretation of the data is shaped by my biases. I like to think I change my opinion when I see data contradicting what I believe. And I like to think I run sanity checks every so often. This post is intended as a sanity check.</p>
<p>I’ve had a few earlier posts that have dealt with tax issues, and those have tended to gravitate toward one of two points. One is that the data tends to show that cutting tax rates does not seem to lead to increased tax collections, and the other is enforcement affects tax collections, and that Republican administrations tend not to be big on tax enforcement. Perhaps I’m biased, but this is what I think the data shows, and I always try to summarize the data in the post as well as make my spreadsheets available.</p>
<p>There are always people who don’t accept the data, or at least my interpretation of the data. So to them… consider this an invitation to tell your story. Below are the percent changes per year in real taxes collected per capita between selected non-random blocks of dates.</p>
<p>1952 – 1960____1.41%<br />1960 – 1963____5.46%<br />1963 – 1968____4.12<br />1968 – 1974____1.36<br />1974 – 1976___-1.17<br />1976 – 1980____4.28<br />1980 – 1988____1.37<br />1988 &#8211; 1992____0.32<br />1992 – 2000_____4.46<br />2000 – 2005____-0.95</p>
<p>1952 – 2005____2.05</p>
<p>(Update&#8230; Correction&#8230; Note&#8230;  I am embarassed.  Reader M. Jed pointed out a mistake.  My original figures for the growth rate under Clinton were twice as high as they should have been.  I divided through by 4 years, rather than 8 for his term.  Apologies all.) </p>
<p>(Update 2&#8230; Now I am more than embarassed&#8230; I am mortified.  I should have been using the geometric mean&#8230;  my original figures were just the average of the percentage changes over each President&#8217;s term.)  </p>
<p>Please tell me how this can be interpreted to mean one or both of the following:</p>
<p>1. cutting tax rates encourages people to expand output which leads to each person actually paying more taxes on the average<br />2. Republican administrations are very diligent at ensuring everyone pays his or her fair share</p>
<p>Feel free to add in whatever other information you want or need to tell your story. I’m genuinely curious to see what I’m missing here.</p>
<p>And as always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them. (BTW… data on real tax collections comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls">OMB Table 1.3. </a>Because the fiscal year runs through Q3 of the calendar year, I divided through by Q3 population from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">BEA NIPA Table 7.1, </a>which of course derives originally from the Census.)</p>
<p>Update&#8230; corrected annual percent change in real per capita tax collections from 1952-2005.<br />Update 2&#8230; corrected  sentences stating that the data posted was for real GDP per capita rather than real tax collections per capita.<br />Update and correction.  As per note above, the original growth rate posted for Clinton was wrong.  Apologies!!!!</p>

<blockquote>Cablevision Systems Corp. awarded options to an executive after his 1999 death, backdating them so that they appeared to have been granted while he was still alive, a regulatory filing revealed. A newspaper report said the executive&#8217;s estate was the beneficiary.  The cable operator also improperly granted options to a former compensation consultant, accounting for them as if the consultant were a Cablevision employee, the company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The deceased executive was not named in the filing but he was identified by the Wall Street Journal as former Vice Chairman Marc Lustgarten.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.professorbainbridge.com/2006/10/a_real_backdati.html">Professor Bainbridge</a> remarks:<br />
<blockquote>Options are supposed to be used as incentive compensation, but it&#8217;s hard to see how you incentivize a dead man.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_10/009768.php">Kevin Drum</a> offers:<br />
<blockquote>Is there anything too revolting for these guys to do in pursuit of another buck? And they wonder why us liberals think they need an occasional watchful eye?</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of watchful eyes – someone call the IRS.  How was this transfer of wealth from a dead guy to his heirs treated in terms of Estate taxation?  Pardon me for being a little suspicious, but did these schemers find a way to end-run the taxman?  </p>
<p>Finally, the following suggests that the executives of Cablevision Systems Corp. might have to address a few lawsuits from the shareholders:<br />
<blockquote>The company said in the filing that its financial statements for 2003, 2004 and 2005 and other financial data should be restated as a result.</p></blockquote>

We were asked to consider one small portion of the SSA’s <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/BudgetTreatment.html">Research Note #20</a> that had to do with how Lyndon Johnson decided to have a unified budget in 1968.  Here is the relevant portion of the Research Note:<br />
<blockquote>In early 1968 President Lyndon Johnson made a change in the budget presentation by including Social Security and all other trust funds in a &#8220;unified budget.&#8221; This is likewise sometimes described by saying that Social Security was placed &#8220;on-budget.&#8221; This 1968 change grew out of the recommendations of a presidential commission appointed by President Johnson in 1967, and known as the President&#8217;s Commission on Budget Concepts. The concern of this Commission was not specifically with the Social Security Trust Funds, but rather it was an effort to rationalize what the Commission viewed as a confusing budget presentation. At that time, the federal budget consisted of three separate and inconsistent sets of measures, and often budget debates became bogged-down in arguments over which of the three to use.</p></blockquote>
<p>So LBJ was trying to reduce confusion whereas George W. Bush loves to create confusion.  Not exactly the point being argued by the troll who brought this up.  But let’s read further down:<br />
<blockquote>In the 1983 Social Security Amendments a provision was included mandating that Social Security be taken &#8220;off-budget&#8221; starting in FY 1993. This was a recommendation from the National Commission on Social Security Reform (aka the Greenspan Commission). The Commission&#8217;s report argued: &#8220;The National Commission believes that changes in the Social Security program should be made only for programmatic reasons, and not for purposes of balancing the budget. Those who support the removal of the operations of the trust funds from the budget believe that this policy of making changes only for programmatic reasons would be more likely to be carried out if the Social Security program were not in the unified budget.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That was Greenspan back in 1983.  Of course, Greenspan in 2001 was concerned that the unified budget was in surplus so he endorsed a series of tax cuts that have created a General Fund crisis that is now being abused by President Bush to excuse raiding the Social Security Trust Fund.  Again – not exactly the point that our favorite troll was trying to make.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I added a graph in light of an excellent point made by AB reader Howard.  The graph shows total Federal debt (TD), debt held by the public (DHP), and intragovernmental holdings (IH) &#8211; all in proportion to GDP.  During the late 1960&#8217;s, the difference between TD and DHP &#8211; which is IH &#8211; was not rising.  So whether we measured the deficit in terms of the General Fund v. the Unified Deficit would not matter that much.  But check out what&#8217;s been happening later to IH. This is the point I&#8217;ve been trying to make since Monday &#8211; even if AB reader Muckdog is not convinced.</p>

                                <p>Fiscal Responsibility and the Budget Authority for Discretionary Programs</p>
<p>I’m not really a macro guy –but there’s a lot of macro data out there, and a data guy like me likes to look around and see how it all runs.  </p>
<p>As I understand the budget process, the President sends a proposed budget to Congress with lots of stuff for his campaign contributors.  The budget goes to Congress, and comes back larded up with stuff for supporters of those who “serve us” in Congress.  (Why am I suddenly reminded of Damon Knight?)  Along the way there’s some back and forth, but basically, the budget reflects the President’s wishes supplemented by those of Congress.  This is particularly true of discretionary spending; mandatory spending, after all, is mandatory, regardless of who is President.  </p>
<p>Wandering through the bowels of the OMB website, I came upon <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist08z9.xls"> Table 8.9 </a>, entitled: “BUDGET AUTHORITY FOR DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS”, and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist08z7.xls"> Table 8.7 </a>, entitled “OUTLAYS FOR DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS.”</p>
<p>Here’s the yearly % change in outlays as a share of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z2.xls"> GDP </a>, and the yearly % change in authority as a share of GDP under President’s Reagan through GW.  (Note… GW data goes through 2005 – the OMB had not updated their tables at the point I pulled the data, and probably won’t for a while.)  </p>
<p>_________% ch in outlays___% ch in authority<br />Reagan_____-1.1_____________-2.6<br />GHW_______-1.9_____________-1.5<br />Clinton_____-3.2_____________-3.7<br />GW_________4.9______________6.6</p>
<p>Leaving out defense</p>
<p>_________% ch in outlays___% ch in authority<br />Reagan____-4.2_____________-5.9<br />GHW_______1.7______________4.0<br />Clinton____-1.4_____________-2.7<br />GW________3.5______________7.0</p>
<p>GW seems to be the clear winner in spending increases… in fact, he’s the only President in the sample who increased discretionary spending as a share of GDP, and did it by more quite a bit more than any of the previous Presidents decreased it.  (Let me, at this point anticipate some of the comments to this post by being the first to note that clearly, by writing this I am biased, delusional and lying, and I clearly must have an irrational hatred toward GW.)  Clinton seems to have done the best job at reducing discretionary budget bloat, and Reagan cut the most from the non-military portion of the discretionary budget.   GHW decreased discretionary spending overall, but increased the non-military portion – this was the Peace Dividend.</p>
<p>(BTW – for those whose knee-jerk reaction is that Clinton’s relatively slow spending increases were Newt Gingrich’s doing…  – the average % change in outlays and average % change in authority for the first two years of his term, before the Republican Revolution, were –4.5% and –6.8%; when defense spending is removed, the figures were 0.2% and -1.7%.  We can conclude the Republican Revolution reduced Clinton’s ability to cut spending.) </p>
<p>But that leaves me with some questions…  why would spending increase at a different rate than authority?  Well, perhaps the President doesn’t spend everything he is authorized to spend on discretionary items.  The table below shows the yearly average percentage change in the Budget Authority on discretionary items less outlays on discretionary items as a share of GDP. </p>
<p>_____average budget authority less spending on discretionary items as a pct of GDP<br />Reagan_______0.62<br />GHW_________-0.06<br />Clinton_______-0.32<br />GW___________0.12</p>
<p>If I understand this correctly, Reagan did the best job at keeping to his budget.  GW is also keeping to his budget.  (In GW’s case, as we see above, those were budgets that bloated very rapidly.)  Both GHW and Clinton tended to overspend their budgets.  (In both cases, each only came in under their authority in one year during their administrations.) </p>
<p>Am I understanding this correctly?  It seems odd that the most fiscally irresponsible President in the sample managed to come in under budget.  (Bear in mind – GW is running two wars on supplementals and appropriations, rather than budgeting for those wars.)  Or that Clinton could get away with consistently spending above his authority, given that during his term there was an open-ended six year sixty million dollar fishing expedition into, well, pretty much everything he ever did, and everything anyone ever thought it was conceivable he might have done.  So what is going on here?  </p>
<p>Postscript.  My spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.<br />Update.  One correction&#8230; erroneous comment about Reagan&#8217;s budgets being bloated removed.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Almost two years ago, I posed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/11/is-social-security-trust-fund-worth.html">this question</a>, which really was the title of a paper by <a href="http://irm.wharton.upenn.edu/WP-security-Smetters.pdf">Kent Smetters</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Several economists including myself would answer yes to this question but then Smetters notes that we are assuming policymakers set spending and tax rates for the other levels of government so as to insure that the General Fund adheres to a long-run balanced budget constraint. In particular note that his Figure 1 shows the assets of the Social Security Trust Fund still rising after 2018 when payouts to retirees start to exceed payroll contributions. The reason for this is that the diagram assumes that the interest on Trust Fund bonds will not be used by the General Fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bring this up in light of the fact that President Bush is confusing the increase in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/increasing-trust-fund-surpluses-and.html">Trust Fund surpluses</a> with fiscal responsibility.  Simply put – the General Fund deficit is not declining.  <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/10/future_shock.html">David Altig</a> quotes the Wall Street Journal as saying:<br />
<blockquote>Strong tax receipts from individuals and corporations helped to shrink the U.S. budget deficit for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 to $248 billion, far narrower than the $423 billion previously projected by the White House &#8230; While the deficit shrank in fiscal 2006, the White House and many economists expect it to widen again this fiscal year as revenue growth slows and spending continues to increase. The costs of entitlement programs are growing faster than the government&#8217;s ability to pay for them, and government debt payments, which totaled $406 billion in fiscal 2006, are also rising.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>For Christ’s sake!</strong>  Where the WSJ is going with this “costs of entitlement programs are growing faster than the government&#8217;s ability to pay for them” is the Trust Fund SURPLUS will not be as large.  David goes onto to note an interesting op-ed by Chris Edwards and Jagadeesh Gokhale:<br />
<blockquote>State and local governments are amassing huge obligations in the form of unfunded retirement benefits for their workers. Aside from underfunded pension plans, governments have also run up large obligations from their retiree health plans &#8230; The only good options are to cut benefits and move state and local retirement plans to a pre-funded basis with personal savings plans</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Pre-funded?</strong>  Wasn’t that what we did back in 1983 with respect to Social Security under President Reagan?  I was all set to agree with something else that <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/10/what_is_the_rig.html">David wrote</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The right measure for characterizing fiscal policy depends on what question is being asked.  If the question is &#8220;Does the government have the current means to pay for its current expenditures?&#8221;, then the unified budget &#8212; which includes receipts from Social Security payroll taxes &#8212; is clearly the right concept.  The reason is that those payroll taxes do finance contemporaneous spending.  Although the portion of that spending paid out of excess Social Security taxes are logged as contributions to the system&#8217;s trust fund, the trust fund never provides independent revenues for the government as a whole.  All future payments in excess of what is collected by the payroll tax must come from other tax sources. However, if the question is &#8220;Does the government have the current means to pay for its current expenditures after it has honored accrued entitlement benefits payable in the current year?&#8221;, then the deficit excluding off-budget items like Social Security is the right concept.  And as I have said many, many times on this weblog, honoring those benefits should be the starting point for any and all discussions of Social Security reform.</p></blockquote>
<p>David was posing the question in a similar fashion to how Kent Smetters posed it.  If David’s point is that the unified budget must be balanced in the long-run, he’s right.  Folks like CalculatedRisk, Andrew Samwick, Dean Baker, and myself would put the additional restriction that the Trust Funds and the General Funds should stand on their own.  Andrew asks that the General Fund not bail out the Trust Funds and I ask the converse.  So when we look at the General Fund, we see massive long-run solvency problems – as compared to a much more modest Social Security Trust Fund issue.  But if there are politicians out there (e.g., George W. Bush) who wants to take our payroll contributions and simply (ab)use them to give tax cuts to the very rich – can we simply ask these folks to just admit it.  To cheerlead now that the unified deficit has shrunk is sort of like cheering for the bank robber to get away.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As I was noting the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/brad-delong-discovers-more-fuzzy-math.html">Clown Show</a> talk from the President, I did not even realize that he made my point here:<br />
<blockquote>We&#8217;ve made good progress, as I mentioned to you, in getting the fiscal house in order, but there&#8217;s another problem with our budget, and that has to do with mandatory spending, particularly with Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. These are really important programs. They&#8217;re called entitlement programs because when each of us retire we&#8217;re entitled to a benefit, in Social Security for example. And yet the health of these programs &#8211; the health is in serious jeopardy &#8230; the government has made promises with a future generation&#8217;s money that we can&#8217;t keep. And so the fundamental question facing the government in Washington, D.C. is: Will we have the will necessary to deal with these entitlement programs to leave behind a better budget picture to deal with the unfunded liabilities and the mandatory programs for future generations? … Look, you don&#8217;t have to cut benefits. You&#8217;ve just got to slow the rate at which benefits are growing in order to make sure a future generation is not strapped with a budgetary system that is unaffordable.</p></blockquote>
<p>So many lies – so little time.  President Reagan in 1983 made a promise to workers my age that if we paid more in payroll contributions, the Social Security Trust Fund will accumulate reserves to pre-fund our benefits.  The real reason these benefits might be in jeopardy is the push by this dishonest President to increase the General Fund deficit so he can get his fat cat contributors both pork barrel spending benefits and tax cuts as well.  Slowing the rate at which benefits grow is just a euphemism for insuring the inflation-adjusted value of our Social Security benefits ARE cut.  Yes – there is an unfunded liability from that expensive Prescription Drug benefit (largely for Big Pharma) that this dishonest President brags about.  When George W. Bush says he’s not cutting your retirement benefits – watch your back because that’s exactly his intention.</p>

<blockquote>Yes, it is George W. Bush once again in the center ring with the funny nose and the big shoes &#8230; Should we say that the 2004 budget deficit was $412.7 billion, and that half of that would be $206.3 billion&#8211;not $248 billion? Should we say that the fiscal year ends in September, not February? Should we say that February never has 30 days? Should we say that February never had&#8211;not even before Julius Caesar &#8211; 30 days?</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, we have a President that doesn’t understand how to read a calendar, but let’s see if 248 divided by 413 is close to 50%.  Whoops, my calculator says it’s 60%.  But fellows – you guys counting those increasing <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/increasing-trust-fund-surpluses-and.html">Trust Fund surpluses</a>.   Maybe if we used the General Fund deficit, which was $595 billion as of fiscal year ended 9/30/2004 and only $574 billion as of 9/30/2006, maybe we’ll get closer to the President’s claim.  Let’s see: 574 divided by 595 is &#8211; Hey!  The four-year just swiped my calculator.  And why is the six-year old screaming adults are idiots?  </p>
<p>Maybe the problem is that the six-year old continued to listen to the President’s speech:<br />
<blockquote>These budget numbers are proof that pro-growth economic policies work. By restraining spending in Washington, and allowing Americans to keep more of what they earn, we&#8217;re creating jobs, reducing the deficit, and making this nation prosperous for all our citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>I say this because he’s now screaming: “if taxes are so high and spending is so low – how come the deficit is running at 4.4% of GDP”.  I blame the First Lady.  It seems our elementary school teachers have done too good of a job at teaching our kids about concepts such as arithmetic even as Laura Bush’s husband has been wasting his time studying <a href="http://thebots.net/FuzzyMath.htm">Fuzzy Math</a>.</p>
