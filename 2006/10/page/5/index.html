<p>This seems like a simple question and our graph, which is drawn from the NIPA tables provided by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, shows defense spending rising from $393 billion in 2001 to $589 billion in 2005.  <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/winslow-t-wheeler/the-2007-defense-budget-m_b_31331.html">Winslow Wheeler</a> looks at the Congressional budgeting process and finds it to be very confusing:<br />
<blockquote>Doing so is a serious mistake; the committees&#8217; numbers are highly misleading, and sometimes have absolutely nothing to do with what is actually spent on defense. For example, on Sept. 21, the Senate Appropriations Committee announced the completion of the House-Senate Conference Committee to resolve differences in two very dissimilar versions of the Department of Defense Appropriations bills the House and Senate had passed earlier in the year. Describing the final result, the Senate Appropriations Committee stated &#8220;The bill provides $436.6 billion in new discretionary spending authority for the Department of Defense for functions under the Defense subcommittee&#8217;s jurisdiction, including $70 billion in additional appropriations to fund operations related to the Global War on Terror (GWOT).&#8221; The next day, the House Appropriations Committee said in its press release that the bill&#8217;s total was &#8220;$377.6 billion (PLUS a $70.0 billion bridge fund for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan).&#8221; $377.6 billion plus $70.0 billion equals $447.6 billion, not the $436.6 billion the Senate Appropriations Committee cited. There&#8217;s an $11 billion difference in describing the same bill!</p></blockquote>
<p>Fiscal conservatives might take heart that Congress is proposing to keep defense spending below $500 billion a year – even as the first half of 2006 saw national defense running at a rate around $615 billion per year.  But let’s Mr. Wheeler continue:<br />
<blockquote>Neither figure constitutes the Department of Defense&#8217;s budget for 2007 &#8211; with or without including spending for the wars in 2007, which will not be the $70.0 billion the committees described. The Senate and House Armed Services Committee also just reached agreement on different legislation, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal year 2007. Those committees told us the total for defense was $532.8 billion ($85.2 billion more than the higher House Appropriations Committee figure above). But the numbers from the House and Senate Armed Services Committees &#8211; while in agreement with each other &#8211; have little, if anything, to do with the amounts will actually be spent on defense in 2007.  Feeling confused? You&#8217;re not alone. Many journalists reported what one of Congress&#8217;s defense committees said and, as a result, misreported to the public just what is the budget for defense spending in fiscal year 2007, which started Oct. 1.</p></blockquote>
<p>By the time he finishes explaining what has been left out of these figures, it turns out that the defense department budget is getting very close to $600 billion.  And that does not include the Department Homeland Security (DHS) budget.  I was hoping the OMB can give us a clearer idea of what the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/defense.html">DoD</a> and the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/dhs.html">DHS</a> are spending.  According to the OMB, DoD spent $474 billion in fiscal year 2005 and plans to spend $512 billion in fiscal year 2006, while DHS spent $39 billion in fiscal year 2005 and plans to spend $67 billion in fiscal year 2006.  The 2007 budget suggests DoD spending will be only $505 billion for fiscal year 2007 with DHS spending dropping to $44 billion.  Funny thing – even the combined actual spending figures are less than what the Bureau of Economic Analysis is reporting – so something is missing.  </p>
<p>Mr. Wheeler is right – this is confusing.  And I’m not sure why any fiscal conservative should trust this budgeting process as it suggests national defense spending will decline in fiscal year 2007.  Look, I’m all for a strong national defense but if conservatives are serious about keeping tax rates low into the future, shouldn’t we all expect a little more clarity in such a large portion of the Federal budget?</p>
<p>Update: AB readers requested that I show defense spending as a percent of GDP for an extended time period, which I’ve done below.  This only fair as the OMB’s claim that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Provides $439.3 billion for the Department of Defense’s base budget &#8211; a 7-percent increase over 2006 and a 48-percent increase over 2001</p></blockquote>
<p>confuses nominal spending increases with real spending increases.  Defense spending as a share of GDP increased from 3.9% in 2001 to 4.7% in 2005.  Defense spending as a share of GDP in the late 1970’s, however, was around 6% but increased to around 7.4% of GDP by 1986.  It seems George W. Bush is a lot like Ronald Reagan: promising to give people their money back but actually increasing long-run taxation by having more defense spending.  </p>

                                <p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002594.html#more">Jared Bernstein</a> and <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/10/perspective_on.html">Menzie Chinn</a> have wonderful charts and excellent analysis of the implications of that BLS benchmark revision.  As Jared notes:<br />
<blockquote>The preliminary revision, announced Friday, was larger than usual: up 810,000. This means that as of March 2006, there were this many more jobs than previously reported, and that employment grew more quickly between March 2005 and March 2006. Given the historically weak record of job growth over this recovery, some have wondered whether this larger than average revision significantly alters that record. The answer, as shown here, is clearly not.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a similar vein, Menzie writes:<br />
<blockquote>Third, we come to perspective. I thought it would be useful to see whether the revision, against a backdrop of 136 million employees, changes one&#8217;s view regarding the trends in employment growth during this expansion vis a vis the previous one.  The answer is no. While large in absolute number, the revision does not change the fact that employment growth has been remarkably low in this expansion. Finally, if my assumptions are not far off the mark, then the upward revision in the employment growth up to March 2006 merely accentuates the deceleration in employment growth in recent months.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Jared quips, the “job market still sucks” even if it doesn’t look quite as bleak as the payroll survey was suggesting before this revision.  Menzie also notes that this revised payroll series is not as far off from an adjusted household series, but I would not go as far as <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&#038;sid=aN6DnkFWl6ho">Carlos Torres</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The payroll revision &#8220;lends additional credence to the signal that the household survey had been sending &#8211; that the job market was very tight,&#8221; said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Greenwich, Connecticut. &#8220;It explains why consumers have stayed so strong. It&#8217;s because they&#8217;ve been seeing good gains in their paychecks.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Sorry to disagree with you Carlos, but real wage growth has not been strong and the employment to population ratio is still stuck at 63.1%.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I’ve had a few posts in the last month or two about taxes and honesty.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/enforcement-and-who-pays-taxes.html"> One post </a>  showed that the lower the degree of tax enforcement, the lower the share of total income taxes paid by the top 1% and 5% of income earners.   <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/are-americans-becoming-less-honest.html"> Another </a>  noted that over time, the correlation between the amount of corporate and individual income taxes paid and enforcement has increased, which seems to indicate that a lot of us are becoming less honest when it comes to taxes.</p>
<p>But how big is the problem of tax evasion? Is there any direct evidence that it gets better or worse in any given year? It’s a tough question to answer because it requires knowing how much income people actually make, not how much they report to the IRS. Being an adorable scamp, I was wandering around the IRS website and located <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab8.xls"> a table </a>  showing, among other things, taxable income (from the Statistics of Income or SOI) as a percentage of total income (from the BEA NIPA tables). The data runs from 1950 to 2004.</p>
<p>Personal income from the BEA includes some items that may not be taxable, such as employer contributions to pensions and income from municipal bonds. But for the most part, something that constitutes one type of income constitutes another type of income, and I would expect that as enforcement rises, the share of SOI reported income as a percentage of personal income would rise. Thus, in years when the President is an individual who is more concerned with (and effective in) upholding the law of the land, we would expect to see SOI reported income as a percentage of personal income rise. Conversely, if the President isn’t concerned about corruption or is ineffective in combating it, we would expect to see the ratio fall. Below is a table showing changes in this quantity for some non-randomly selected years.</p>
<p>__Years______Yearly Change<br />1953 &#8211; 1960_______0.32<br />1960 &#8211; 1963_______0.63<br />1963 &#8211; 1968_______1.19<br />1968 &#8211; 1973______-0.69<br />1973 &#8211; 1976______-0.11<br />1976 &#8211; 1980______-0.12<br />1980 &#8211; 1988_______0.42<br />1988 &#8211; 1992______-0.86<br />1992 &#8211; 2000_______1.09<br />2000 &#8211; 2004______-1.51</p>
<p>Ranking Presidents by the yearly change in this ratio over their presidency:</p>
<p>1.  LBJ<br />2.  Clinton<br />3.  JFK<br />4.  Reagan<br />5.  Ike<br />6.  Ford<br />7.  Carter<br />8.  Nixon<br />9.  GHW Bush<br />10. GW Bush</p>
<p>To me, and perhaps this simply reflects my biases, the surprises are with Reagan, Carter, and GHW. I am too young to remember anything about the Carter administration, and I wasn’t in the country at the time anyway, but it seems to me that Carter had a reputation for honesty but ineptitude. I guess in this instance, his ineptitude beat the heck out of honesty. I personally didn’t expect GHW to score so low. Certainly not below Nixon. I also would have expected Ike to score a bit higher from what I’ve read about him. As to Reagan, I wouldn’t have expected him to be a person who would care about enforcing tax laws (or most other white collar type laws), what with his reputation as a tax cutter, and the government being the problem and not the solution and all that.</p>
<p>But an interesting detail…. Adding a little bit to the first table:</p>
<p>__Years______Yearly Change<br />1953 &#8211; 1960_______0.32<br />1960 &#8211; 1963_______0.63<br />1963 &#8211; 1968_______1.19<br />1968 &#8211; 1973______-0.69<br />1973 &#8211; 1976______-0.11<br />1976 &#8211; 1980______-0.12<br />1980 &#8211; 1984______-0.32<br />1984 &#8211; 1988_______1.17<br />1988 &#8211; 1992______-0.86<br />1992 &#8211; 2000_______1.09<br />2000 &#8211; 2004______-1.51</p>
<p>It seems that Reagan’s second term was very different from his first term. In his second term, he became the second biggest tax enforcer in the sample. We all know Reagan went back on his tax cuts (one can point out he raised taxes on different people than those who got the tax cuts) when it appeared that trickle down economics really amounted to little more than piss-on-the-poor-and-run-up-a-deficit in practice. Apparently, he started enforcing tax laws too. Put another way – despite his encroaching senility, the man learned from his mistakes. I hope we are lucky enough to one day be able to say the same about GW.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/10/09/allen.stocks.ap/index.html">AP</a> lays out the facts:<br />
<blockquote>RICHMOND, Virginia (AP) &#8211; Sen. George Allen, locked in a tight re-election race, still holds stock options from his time as director of a high-tech company, but has failed to disclose them to Congress and the public the past five years. The Virginia Republican also asked the Army to help another business that gave him similar options. Congressional rules require senators to disclose to the Senate all deferred compensation, such as stock options. The rules also urge senators to avoid taking any official action that could benefit them financially or appear to do so. Those requirements exist so the public can police lawmakers for possible conflicts of interest, especially involving companies with government business that lawmakers can influence. Allen&#8217;s stock options date to the period from January 1998 to January 2001 when Allen was between political jobs and had plunged into the corporate world. An Associated Press review of Allen&#8217;s financial dealings from that era found that the senator:<br />• Did not have to look far to find corporate suitors, joining three Virginia high-tech companies he assisted as governor. Allen served on boards of directors for Xybernaut and Commonwealth Biotechnologies and advised a third company called Com-Net Ericsson, all government contractors.<br />• Twice failed to promptly alert the Securities and Exchange Commission of insider stock transactions as a Xybernaut and Commonwealth director. The SEC requires timely notification and can fine those who file late.<br />• Kept stock options provided to him for serving as a director of Xybernaut and Commonwealth, but steered other compensation from his board service to his law firm.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story later described Senator Allen’s excuses:<br />
<blockquote>In interviews, Allen and his staff sought to play down his corporate dealings, saying they were a good learning experience but did not lead to extraordinary riches &#8211; except for a quarter-million-dollar windfall from Com-Net Ericsson stock. Allen&#8217;s office said he sold his Xybernaut stock at a loss and has not cashed in his Commonwealth options because they cost more than the stock is now worth. The senator also said he saw no conflict going to work for companies shortly after assisting them as governor. &#8220;I actually got no money out of Xybernaut. I got paid in stock options which were worthless. Commonwealth Biotech asked me to be on their board. Glad to do it. I learned a lot on their board and enjoyed working with them, and they seem to be doing all right, I guess,&#8221; Allen said.</p></blockquote>
<p>But then comes the reality:<br />
<blockquote>The disclosure requirements exist so the public can watch for potential conflicts of interest, and Allen had an obligation to report his Commonwealth stock options to Congress, two ethics experts said. &#8220;As an ethical matter, it&#8217;s irrelevant whether the exercise price of those stock options is above or below the current market price of the stock,&#8221; said Kathleen Clark, a Washington University of St. Louis law professor, former prosecutor and former Democratic congressional aide. &#8220;If he owns stock options, he does have such a financial stake, whether the exercise price is above or below current market value.&#8221; Lawyer Marc Elias, who represents Democrats in ethics cases, said the conflict issue is even clearer because Commonwealth gets federal contracts. &#8220;Unlike some other controversies that have come up from time to time, this is a situation where the underlying asset is in a company that has business before Congress,&#8221; Elias said &#8230; Both Commonwealth and Xybernaut have suffered through difficult times and federal contracts have been an important financial lifeline in recent years. Allen&#8217;s office acknowledges he has met socially over the years with company executives and his office has granted &#8220;routine courtesy meetings&#8221; from company lobbyists &#8220;to hear their opinion on legislation and issues before the federal government.&#8221; Reid said he is aware of only one time that Allen&#8217;s office helped any of his former companies. That came in December 2001 when Allen asked the Army to resolve a lingering issue with Xybernaut. The company asked Allen to intervene, and he urged the Army to give Xybernaut an answer, Reid said. At the time, Allen still owned options to buy 110,000 shares of Xybernaut stock, which could be affected by any new federal contracts.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/corruption_in_washington_/2006/10/macaca_business.php">Mark Kleiman</a> weighs in as does <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/010262.php">Joshua Marshall</a> <br />
<blockquote>We have word that Allen has responded to the AP story. &#8220;I don&#8217;t even know what &#8216;stock options&#8217; means. I just made the term up. I have never used that term in my private life.&#8221; Maybe so, but we understand that the use of &#8220;stock options&#8221; began in French colonial North Africa, where Allen&#8217;s mother was raised.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the excuses offered by Senator Allen, maybe he does not understand stock options.  Even underwater options have value if the price of the underlying stock has some possibility of increasing.  It is sort of like holding a lottery ticket before the announcement of the winning numbers – a low probability exists that one might cash in but if one does, one could make a fortune.  Now suppose one of the holders of the lottery ticket actually got to influence which numbers would be chosen.  I’m not saying that Senator Allen actually tried to increase the value of the companies for which he held options by altering public policy decisions, but isn’t this why we have disclosure requirements in the first place?</p>

                                <p>Soon after I expressed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/accounting-for-defined-benefits-plans.html">my frustration</a> with unified deficit types (which includes apparently <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/10/if_you_care_abo.html">Daivd Altig</a>), we see that <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/10/06/budget.deficit.ap/index.html">the press</a> is falling for the deficit is improving canard:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8211; The federal budget deficit estimate for the fiscal year just completed has dropped to $250 billion, congressional estimators said Friday, as the economy continued to fuel impressive tax revenues. The Congressional Budget Office&#8217;s latest estimate is $10 billion below CBO predictions issued in August and well below a July White House prediction of $296 billion. The improving deficit picture &#8211; Bush predicted a $423 billion deficit in his February budget &#8211; has been driven by better-than-expected tax receipts, especially from corporate profits, CBO said. The 2005 deficit registered $318 billion; the record $413 billion deficit was posted in 2004. At $250 billion, it would be the lowest since the $158 billion figure in 2002, the first deficit following four years of surpluses. The CBO estimate continues a positive trend on the deficit after a grim deficit performance during President Bush&#8217;s first term, and comes despite soaring war costs and $50 billion in emergency spending for hurricane relief. House Budget Committee Chairman Jim Nussle, R-Iowa, credited the improving deficit numbers to &#8220;a responsible budget blueprint and pro-growth policies,&#8221; even as Democrats pointed out that at $250 billion, the deficit is still one of the largest in history.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the <a href="http://www.publicdebt.treas.gov/opd/opdpdodt.htm#years">Treasury Department</a> shows total Federal debt (total), debt held by the public (DHP), and intragovernmental holding (IH), I thought I’d plot the change in each series.  Over the past four fiscal years, the increase in total Federal debt has been between $550 and $600 billion per year.  So to suggest that the General Fund deficit is falling would be incorrect.  The reason that the unified deficit has declined a bit is due to the fact that the Trust Funds are running larger surpluses.</p>

<p>In other words, we should be seeing more pre-funding of our Social Security retirement benefits.  Alas, the fiscal policy of the current Administration is to rack up more and more Federal debt.  And they have the gall to brag about the fact that they are robbing more and more of our retirement benefits in order to give tax cuts to the rich?  Yes, this White House is actually bragging about stealing more of worker retirement funds to finance their reverse Robin Hood fiscal irresponsibility.  But hey – it is a Republican Administration.  I guess my problem is that the Steno Sue press reports all of this as good news.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader Woody points us to some graph from the <a href="http://www.heritage.org/research/features/budgetchartbook/charts_C/c3.cfm">Heritage Foundation</a> entitled “Average Federal Budget Surplus or Deficit as a Percentage of GDP, by Administration”.  Poor Woody does not realize that the Heritage crowd was looking at the unified deficit and not the general fund deficit.  Even then, the fiscal record of Reagan-Bush41 and Bush43 looks quite bleak when compared to the fiscal record of Kennedy-Johnson, Nixon-Ford, Carter, and Clinton.  Now if one does this in terms of the average annual increase in real total Federal debt per year as a percent of GDP, the records of Reagan-Bush41 and Bush43 would look even worse by comparison.  </p>
<p>Taking total Federal debt relative to the GDP deflator (base year 2000), the current inflation-adjusted debt is about $7488 billion as opposed to $5635 billion five years ago – representing a 33% increase over the past five years (about 6% per year).  Ten year ago, the real Federal debt was $5567 so during the 1996 to 2001 period, real debt grew by about 1.2%.  Let’s compare these increases to the periods from 1960 (real debt = $1473 billion) to 1980 (real debt = $1720 billion) and from 1980 to 1996.  During the periods when Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, and Carter were Presidents, real debt grew by only 17% over a 20-year period.  During the next sixteen years, real debt grew by 224% over a 16-year period (about 5.5% per year).  OK, 33% is less than 224% but if the current fiscal policy is not changed – we will likely be witnessing the same debt explosion following the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that we witnesses as a result of Reagan’s fiscal fiasco.  Of course, Heritage-quality research rarely admits to this rather obvious point.</p>

                                <p>As <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/10/fiscal-2006-national-debt-increases.html">CalculatedRisk</a> has some fun with the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/bogus-budget-projections.html">unified deficit</a> along with his proper noting that there is a Social Security Trust Fund that is accumulating reserves to pre-fund the retirement benefits of the baby boom generation, I’m reminded why I get ticked off at the unified budget types.  It is sort of why I get ticked off at CFOs who play games with <a href="http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2005/1005/essentials/p54.htm">SFAS 87</a>, that is, Employer’s Accounting for Pensions.  <a href="http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/old/07688326.htm">Robert Mills</a> writing in the July 1989 CPA Journal noted:<br />
<blockquote>The study reveals that the most common benefit plan selected by companies was the Defined Benefit Plans for single employers and that the assumed discount rate for most of the companies in all industry classifications ranged between 8% and 9.9%. An analysis of the results generated from the research reveals that requiring a standardized method for measuring pension cost is more understandable, comparable, and useful. Additionally, users can now better understand the effect and extent of employers&#8217; efforts to provide pensions due to expanded disclosure of statistical and financial data. However, it is believed that the one way where financial reporting can be enhanced is by narrowing the range of actuarial assumptions relating to rates of return on assets, rates of discount, and rates of compensation increase.</p></blockquote>
<p>One might wonder why private defined benefits plans are co-mingled with the financing of the corporation.  It not only sets up the requirements that shareholders have to be informed as to the expected cost of deferred compensation, it puts worker retirements at risk if the corporation ends up in financial difficulty.</p>
<p>Of course, people might wish to have at least some of their retirement in a defined benefits plan – be it privately run or publicly run.  The whole Bush push for privatization sort of misses this point.  And if we are going to have a defined benefits plan that is not commingled with the fortunes of corporations being run (hopefully) in the interest of shareholders – why not have it be run by the government?  Besides, the Social Security Administration annually publishes not only its historical financials but also its projections of inflows and outflows over the next 75 years.  And when we review these projections, the health of the system looks pretty good.</p>
<p>So why does <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/10/bernanke_we_must_cut_the_feds.html#013828">Dean Baker</a> has to continue to remind us of things such as the following:<br />
<blockquote>Of course, Mr. Bernanke knows that three quarters of this projected increase in spending is due to the projected rise in Medicare costs. The projected increase in Social Security spending is relatively modest over the next 45 years and in fact no larger than it was over the last 45 years. In addition, he also knows that workers have already largely paid for this projected increase in spending, paying a designated Social Security tax that exceeds current needs. The Congressional Budget Office projects that future tax revenue, plus the accumulated surplus over the last quarter century, will be sufficient to pay all scheduled Social Security benefits through the year 2046, with no changes whatsoever. So, Mr. Bernanke was not being honest when he claims there is a problem with Social Security. There is a problem with projected Medicare spending. Because of the projected problem with Medicare spending, there is also a problem with any category of spending which includes Medicare.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh yea, there was some speech by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/fed/2006-10-04-bernanke-retirement-programs_x.htm">Ben Bernanke</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Fed chief said Congress could not avoid hard choices to reform what he called &#8220;unsustainable&#8221; Medicare and Social Security benefits. If Congress shores up the programs solely through higher revenue, taxes would have to rise by 25% by 2030, with further increases needed down the line.</p></blockquote>
<p>Much of what Bernanke had to say was quite right, but I can see where Dean is coming from.  It would be like saying why not improve the income statement of <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/is?s=GM&#038;annual">this company</a> by ignoring its defined benefits commitments to its works.  Then again – General Motors is taking away the retirement benefits so shareholders can make more equity.  But isn’t that the real agenda behind George W. Bush’s fiscal policy – create a train wreck per the General Fund via reduction in tax rates on capital income so that the retirement benefits under Social Security have to be slashed?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/10/if_you_care_abo.html">David Altig</a> objects:<br />
<blockquote>The trick there is the stipulation that &#8220;future tax revenue, plus the accumulated surplus will be sufficient to pay all scheduled Social Security benefits.&#8221;  It is fair enough to say that the Social Security &#8220;trust fund&#8221; is a promise to workers that the government ought not breach.  It is incorrect to say that it will finance &#8220;all scheduled Social Security benefits&#8221; in any economically meaningful sense &#8230; In other words, the Social Security ceases to be self-financing out of payroll taxes in about 10 years.  Absent an increase in overall tax revenues or a reduction in government spending, the payment of scheduled social security benefits adds to the deficit. If you think that deficits are a problem, then logic compels you to treat the payment of accrued Social Security promises as a problem, and one that will arrive in fairly short order.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, David thinks we have a small current problem in the form of the circa $240 billion unified budget deficit – whereas some of us (e.g., CalculatedRisk) think we have a large current problem in the form of a circa $575 billion general fund deficit.  And what is this “absent an increase in overall tax revenues” et al.?  Haven’t I been clear that George W. Bush only shifted the tax burden onto the future?  Yes, we will see someone’s taxes go up in the future.  Either this will be explicit or it will take the form of an implicit tax increase ala a massive conversion of what workers thought were payroll contributions to their future Social Security retirement benefit into a retroactive employment tax increase.  If Republicans wish to see this massive backdoor employment tax increase – might they at least have the integrity to say so?</p>

                                <p>Long-term readers of Angrybear know I often appeal to the logic of the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH).  In comments to a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/on-that-record-dow.html">recent post</a>, one reader suggested EMH was so outdated that even Burton Malkiel has abandoned it.  That claim surprised me in light of his April 2003 paper <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~ceps/workingpapers/91malkiel.pdf">The Efficient Market Hypothesis and Its Critics</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The intellectual dominance of the efficient-market revolution has more been challenged by economists who stress psychological and behavioral elements of stock-price determination and by econometricians who argue that stock returns are, to a considerable extent, predictable. This survey examines the attacks on the efficient-market hypothesis and the relationship between predictability and efficiency. I conclude that our stock markets are more efficient and less predictable than many recent academic papers would have us believe &#8230; For me, the most direct and most convincing tests of market efficiency are direct tests of the ability of professional fund managers to outperform the market as a whole. Surely, if market prices were determined by irrational investors and systematically deviated from rational estimates of the present value of corporations, and if it was easy to spot predictable patterns in security returns or anomalous security prices, then professional fund managers should be able to beat the market &#8230; A remarkably large body of evidence suggesting that professional investment managers are not able to outperform index funds that simply buy and hold the broad stock market portfolio.</p></blockquote>
<p>A couple of years later, Malkiel wrote <a href="http://www.e-m-h.org/Malkiel2005.pdf">Reflections on the Efficient Market Hypothesis: 30 Years Later</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In recent years financial economists have increasingly questioned the efficient market hypothesis. But surely if market prices were often irrational and if market returns were as predictable as some critics have claimed, then professionally managed investment funds should easily be able to outdistance a passive index fund. This paper shows that professional investment managers, both in The U.S. and abroad, do not outperform their index benchmarks and provides evidence that by and large market prices do seem to reflect all available information.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not aware of a subsequent paper where Professor Malkiel has abandoned his long held view – but I’d appreciate it if someone would provide us with his latest thoughts.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.danielgross.net/archives/2006/10/01-week/index.html#a001208">Daniel Gross</a> reads <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/06/AR2006100600335.html">Nell Henderson and Peter Baker</a> reporting on yesterday’s report that employment growth was very weak and just shakes his head.  The title of the Washington Post article was “U.S. Job Numbers Remain Strong Bush Promotes September Totals”.  Beyond falsely claiming the BLS reported strong employment growth, Henderson and Baker write:<br />
<blockquote>Demand for labor helped drive workers&#8217; average hourly wages, not including those of most managers, up to $16.84 last month. That&#8217;s a 4 percent increase from September 2005, the fastest wage growth in more than five years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dan reminds us that consumer prices have increased by 3.8% over the same period.  Our graph shows real wages of non-supervisory employees in terms of 1982$ as reported by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Real wages as of August 2006 were $8.16 as compared to $8.15 as of August 2005.  Real wages back in August 2001 were $8.13 but increased to $8.23 as of August 2002 and were $8.28 as of August 2003.  It is true that real wages fell over the next two years &#8211; even if Dick Cheney was falsely claiming real wages were rising during the 2004 Presidential campaign.  </p>
<p>If Henderson and Baker are to write on labor market issues, might we expect them to understand the difference between nominal wages increases and change in real wages?</p>

                                <p>It’s late Friday and <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/10/september-employment-report.html">CalculatedRisk</a> has the headline news and more:<br />
<blockquote>U.S. nonfarm payrolls climbed by 51,000 in September, after a revised 188,000 gain in August, and the unemployment rate fell slightly to 4.6% in September from 4.7% in August.</p></blockquote>
<p>Employment per the payroll survey is up by only 51 thousand and the unemployment rate fell?  Let’s check out the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">BLS report</a> for the household survey.   It seems the household survey says employment rose by 271 thousand whereas the labor force rose by 101 thousand.  Taking this to two decimal points, it seems the employment to population rose inched up from 63.09% to 63.14%, while the labor force participation rate inched down from 66.20% to 66.17%.  Aha – some news for <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/10/20061006-9.html">George Bush</a> to crow about:<br />
<blockquote>Secretary Paulson and I want to thank FedEx for inviting us here today to have a discussion about our economy and about entrepreneurship. We just met with a handful of small business owners, business creators, people who had an innovative idea, followed up on their idea and have now built healthy little businesses that are growing and employing people. I don&#8217;t necessarily want to speak for the Secretary, but I will tell you that it does my spirits good to be able to talk to risk-takers and dreamers and doers &#8230; I say that because today we got more good news. The national unemployment rate is down to 4.6 percent. We added 6.6 million new jobs since August of 2003. The wages are going up, energy prices are falling, which means people are going to have more money in their pocket to save, invest, or spend. And the fundamental question is, how do we make sure we sustain the economic growth? And one way to do so is to make the tax cuts we passed permanent. One sure way to hurt this economy is to take money out of the pockets of consumers, or small business owners, and send it to Washington, D.C.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if this President really does believe that nonsense about the difference between the household survey and the payroll survey being some sort of self-employment surge?  He certainly does want to babble on about all sorts of other nonsense (e.g.., wages up and permanent tax cuts).  </p>
<p><em>That’s my excuse for being so tardy today</em> – I had to wait to see what kind of garbage we’d get from the President!</p>
