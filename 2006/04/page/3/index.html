                                <p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/06_04_16_corner-archive.asp#095179">Jonah Goldberg</a> says GOTCHYA after he read <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,192065,00.html">Brit Hume</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Former Clinton CENTCOM commander, Anthony Zinni … But in early 2000, Zinni told Congress &#8220;Iraq remains the most significant near-term threat to U.S. interests in the Arabian Gulf region,&#8221; adding, &#8220;Iraq probably is continuing clandestine nuclear research, [and] retains stocks of chemical and biological munitions &#8230; Even if Baghdad reversed its course and surrendered all WMD capabilities, it retains scientific, technical, and industrial infrastructure to replace agents and munitions within weeks or months.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I see.  The criticism of Rumsfeld is all Clinton’s fault.  Zinni is some Michael Moore leftie who has flip-flopped.  I’m wondering if Hume got this some from <a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/articles.php?article_id=5415">this source</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Nevertheless, in February of 2000, long before President Bush assumed office, Zinni felt confident enough to provide a strikingly familiar threat assessment on Iraq to the Senate Armed Services Committee.</p></blockquote>
<p>The “American Thinking” went so far as to suggest that General Zinni told Congress that Al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein were allies.  But we can also thank him for <a href="http://armed-services.senate.gov/statemnt/2000/000229az.pdf">this link</a> to Zinni’s 29 page testimony.  </p>
<p>Iraq is not even mentioned until page 9 of this 29 page document and Zinni led with:<br />
<blockquote>While Iraq&#8217;s WMD capabilities were degraded under UN supervision and set back by Coalition strikes, some capabilities remain and others could quickly be regenerated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the entire threat assessment for yourself and you’ll likely agree with me – Brit Hume has lied again.  But why would Hume and Goldberg launch such a pathetic and dishonest attack against the former CENTCOM commander?  Maybe they are afraid he’ll do in 2008 what GeneraL Wesley Clark did in 2004 – run for the White House as a Democrat.  Yes – the Swift Boat campaign has started early this time.  </p>
<p>But I have a question for Mr. Goldberg.  Since it took me all of two minutes to find the actual testimony, why couldn’t you?  I am assuming you actually know how to read.  But then – I might be incorrect in this assumption.</p>
<p>(Link corrected &#8211; and AB reader Greg notes that the first reference to Iraq was on page 7 with the total number of pages being 39 not 29)</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200604170812.asp">John Tamny</a> wants to remind Lawrence Lindsey about the Hume Specie Flow Model:<br />
<blockquote>To begin, just as Chinese authorities fix the yuan’s value, so too do U.S. authorities fix the dollar’s value. As the Journal’s George Melloan noted in a recent editorial, “no currency actually ‘floats.’” As opposed to commodities set by market forces, currencies today are merely paper concepts controlled by central banks through the creation of and extinguishment of that paper. That the above is true calls into question Lindsey’s assertion that the “Chinese clearly undervalue their exchange rate.” More realistically, the Chinese likely recognize that the yuan’s credibility will be best maintained if its value is mostly fixed against the world’s senior currency, the U.S. dollar. David Ranson and Arthur Laffer are but two economists who have said that absent the yuan’s tight relationship with the dollar, market forces would arguably drive the value of the former down. Regarding the exchange of goods between the two countries, Lindsey argues that the supposedly undervalued yuan creates “losers,” specifically the “American producers of goods that are now made in China.” Implicit here is the flawed assumption that changes in currency values impact the real price of anything. In truth, as 18th century philosopher David Hume wrote, “the greater or less plenty of money is of no consequence” in trade since the price of commodities always adjusts to any changes in a currency’s value.</p></blockquote>
<p>In a April 2003 discussion of Argentina’s fixed exchange rate regime, <a href="http://quote.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000039&#038;sid=aKTooeoTq8qw&#038;refer=columnist_derosa">Bloomberg</a> provided this succinct description of the Hume specie flow mechanism: <br />
<blockquote>The most important thing about the gold standard was that all countries were on the same system. And we have known from the days of British philosopher and economist David Hume that when several countries are on the gold standard there is an automatic mechanism that achieves equilibrium. This process, called Hume Specie Flow, dictates that gold will flow naturally from a country having higher prices to a country having lower prices. It is like the autonomic nervous system on the human body that unconsciously regulates vital body functions. But if only Argentina is on the gold standard, there is no place for the gold to flow. True enough, one country could base its currency on the value of gold, which would require that country to operate something like a gold currency board. The government would have to stand ready to exchange gold for pesos and pesos for gold on demand. Hence, it would be left with something very much like the currency board that blew up at the beginning of 2002. </p></blockquote>
<p>Lindsey’s <a href="http://users1.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users1&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB114429292698818544.html%3Fmod%3Dtodays_us_opinion">WSJ oped</a> covered a variety of issues and was favorably received by <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/123457">Brad Setser</a> in terms of the impact of Chinese policy on the U.S. economy:<br />
<blockquote>Even if the US economy as a whole benefits from taking on external debt to finance consumption and real-estate led growth, China&#8217;s central bank is helping to determine which parts of the US economy are thriving, and which are not.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2006/04/a_cause_of_rati.html">Don Boudreaux</a> had another interesting take on U.S. concerns:<br />
<blockquote>Without here getting into the question of whether or not Uncle Sam would be wise to pressure China to let the value of the yuan rise, Lindsey&#8217;s remarks imply that, even as conventionally reckoned, Americans&#8217; savings rate is not irresponsibly low.  If foreign governments are forcing their citizens to subsidize Americans&#8217; consumption, what&#8217;s irrational or irresponsible about Americans relying upon these subsidies and, thus, consuming more and saving less? Put differently, if foreign-govenment monetary and trade policies truly are lowering the cost to Americans of consuming more today, it&#8217;s off-the-mark to lay the blame for Americans&#8217; low saving rate on Americans&#8217; irrationality, irresponsibility, myopia, stupidity, laziness, or crass materialism.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad takes us back to the issue that Tamny raised:<br />
<blockquote>Most of Lindsey&#8217;s oped is devoted to explaining to the readers of the Wall Street Journal &#8211; or perhaps the editors of its oped page &#8211; why China&#8217;s de facto peg is bad even if fixed exchange rates generally are good.  The argument is rather ingenious: basically, China&#8217;s fixed exchange rate reinforced government control over the rest of the economy: &#8220;The Chinese authorities are intent on maintaining a fixed exchange rate not to provide discipline to the People&#8217;s Bank of China, but to maintain state control over the economy.&#8221;   It doesn&#8217;t really matter whether Lindsey&#8217;s specific argment that China&#8217;s peg reinforces state control is true; I suspect it is directed at providing a specific audience in the US an argument to use in US internal debates, not at China.   Lindsey is trying to explain why it is OK to think that Argentina should have held on to its peg &#8211; or even dollarized &#8211; back in 2001 but that China should not stick steadfastly to its peg now. </p></blockquote>
<p>Just as Argentina’s pegged exchange rate outlived its usefulness by 2001 with an overvalued peso and rising trade deficits, Brad Setser and Lawrence Lindsey appear to agree that the pegged yuan has led to an undervalued yuan and large trade surpluses.  So given this Hume specie flow – why isn’t Chinese monetary growth and inflation leading to a self-correction as Tamny suggest should happen in theory?  </p>
<p>Some of Tamny’s NRO colleagues seem to be under the illusion that Chinese monetary growth has been implicitly set by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  Of course, this assertion is absurd given the fact that the Chinese monetary growth has greatly exceeded U.S. monetary growth over the past several years.  But given the extent of reserve accumulation by the Chinese Central Bank – one might wonder why Chinese monetary growth has not been higher.  Brad Setser answers <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/113297">sterilization</a>. Then again – this sterilization has only been <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/20051216-fri.html#anchor27">partial</a>. But even with rapid monetary growth, China’s <a href="http://www.morganstanley.com/GEFdata/digests/20060227-mon.html#anchor3">inflation rate</a> has been very modest.  </p>
<p>It’s nice to see Mr. Tamny has learned about the Hume Specie Flow mechanism, but he should be careful before he insists that this simple theory always works so perfectly in practice.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Bruce Webb wants to know what Brad Setser means by “sterilization bonds”.  Good question! Maybe Brad S’s comment to <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2004-2_archives/000597.html">this post</a> from Brad DeLong might help: <br />
<blockquote>Sterilization implies that China offsets the increase in the money supply associated with higher dollar reserves by issuing renminbi sterilization bonds (selling reminbi bonds for reminbi cash) at current exchange rates. The PBoC ends up with a renminbi liability (the sterilization bond), and a dollar asset &#8211; its fx reserves.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad D. had linked to another <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/91264">Brad S.</a> on the accumulation of international reserves by China’s Central Bank.  As background, check the other Q&#038;A comments to Brad D’s post.  An interesting discussion – even if the National Review crowd has never bothered to read anything of the sort.</p>

<blockquote>I’ve come to believe that John Snow is doing a terrific job. Since he was nominated by the president in January 2003, he has been at the center of the Bush administration’s best economic initiatives. In his first months in office, he helped push through the 2003 tax cuts on personal income, dividends, and capital gains. Those tax cuts were arguably the Bush administration’s single best economic policy initiative — the catalyst for a sharp turnaround in economic growth and job creation. Those tax cuts probably wouldn’t have happened were it not for Snow’s tireless salesmanship. The only time I ever met Snow, in fact, was at a presidential briefing on the tax cuts with a small group of economists in April 2003. As soon as the meeting broke up, Snow raced up to me, grabbed me by the arm, and took me and two other economists out to the White House lawn where he whipped up a spontaneous press conference to ballyhoo the tax cuts. </p></blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Ballyhoo</strong></em> is an interesting way to put this and I could spend an entire post mocking the premise that the 2003 tax cuts led to the belated recovery.  But it is the following that needs mocking even more:<br />
<blockquote>If the tax cuts were the administration’s finest economic hour, then its 2002 steel tariffs probably were its worst. They were implemented under Snow’s predecessor, Paul O’Neill. They were rescinded in Snow’s first year in office. </p></blockquote>
<p>Let me agree with Mr. Luskin that the 2002 steel tariffs were bad policy – but it was not Treas. Sec. O’Neill that pushed forward this idea.  That honor belongs to Vice President Cheney.</p>

                                <p>The Department of State’s <a href="http://www.nysun.com/pics/31062_2.php">July 9, 2003</a> continues to be discussed in the PlameGate matter.  The latest is from the <a href="http://www.nysun.com/pf.php?id=31062">New York Sun</a> article entitled “No Hint Seen in Memo that Plame&#8217;s Role Was Secret”:<br />
<blockquote>Contrary to published reports, a State Department memorandum at the center of the investigation into the leak of the name of a CIA operative, Valerie Plame, appears to offer no particular indication that Ms. Plame&#8217;s role at the agency was classified or covert. The memo, drafted by the then head of the State Department&#8217;s Bureau of Intelligence and Research and addressed to the then secretary of state, Colin Powell, was carried aboard Air Force One as President Bush departed for Africa in July 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that this memo was on board Air Force One shortly before Robert Novak revealed to the world that Valerie Plame was a CIA operative is the intriguing sentence here.  As far as the title and the first sentence of the NY Sun’s piece – notice that the top and the bottom of each page of the July 9, 2003 memo was stamped “Secret”.</p>

                                <p>Sensible and honest conservative Bruce Bartlett emails me the latest nonsense from <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/murdock/murdock200604170633.asp">Deroy Murdock</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Modest legislation to extend President Bush&#8217;s tax cuts for two years, rather than make them permanent, is trapped in a House-Senate conference committee. Such inaction might be understandable if tax cuts actually &#8220;ballooned the deficit,&#8221; as tax hikers always charge. In fact, the opposite is true: Federal revenues surged 15 percent last year. The Laffer Curve, economist Arthur Laffer&#8217;s oft-dismissed theory that marginal tax-rate reduction lifts revenues by accelerating economic activity, has been vindicated, yet again. While liberal critics giggle to themselves, Laffer gets the last laugh as the economy follows his model. </p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Mr. Murdock forgot that the 2001 tax cut was followed by contined weak growth in real GDP.  And does he not realize that real tax revenues per capita are still below where they were in 2000?  Maybe he really believes this Laffer curve spin, which is why he resorts to blaming the large Federal deficits on higher government spending:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Had the President and Congress limited federal spending increases to 4 percent each year since FY 2001, the budget would be out of the red next year and would yield a surplus of $58 billion instead of a $354 billion deficit,&#8221; says  National Taxpayers Union president John Berthoud. &#8220;Considering that in 2010, the Administration still expects a shortfall of $183 billion, a little self-restraint would have gone a long way.&#8221; NTU&#8217;s Pete Sepp calculates that &#8220;the GOP Congress added $525 billion of inflation-adjusted federal spending between FY 2000 and FY 2007, an increase, after inflation, of 29 percent.&#8221; Simply put, limiting spending to inflation would have saved taxpayers more than half a trillion dollars since 2000. </p></blockquote>
<p>President Bush during the 2001 State of the Union address promised to limit spending increases to 4% per year after inflation.  A 29% real increase over a 7-year period amounts to an average annual increase of only 3.7%.  </p>
<p><a href="http://%20beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/04/when-out-of-context-is-untrue.html">Dean Baker</a> wisely advises that: <br />
<blockquote>The impact of the deficit on the economy, and the potential debt burden it poses to taxpayers in the future, depends entirely on its size relative to the economy. This is the Bill Gates principle. If Bill Gates chooses to borrow $1 million for some reason, it is not a big deal for him, since he can easily repay this sum. However, if most of us had $1 million in debt, this would be a very big deal for us. It is entirely possible that Bill Gates actually has borrowed millions of dollars for various purposes, but a comparison of our wealth with Bill Gates’ wealth that focused only on his debts, without including his assets, would be ridiculous. That is effectively what reporters do when they compare budget deficits through time, without comparing them to the size of the economy. The proper measure is to describe the deficit relative to GDP.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a fair point, which should also extend to comparisons about spending and taxes.  Taxes as a share of GDP have fallen since 2000.  But with real GDP growth averaging 3.2% per year, government spending as a share of GDP has increased – SLIGHTLY.  </p>
<p>My concern is less that we have the largest deficit in history – as Dean notes, that’s not true.  My concern is that certain Republicans have no clue as to how to turn this deficit around.  Not only do we get Mr. Murdock’s silly op-ed, we also get even more brazen fiscal dishonesty from the House Republican crowd – who wish to buy the 2006 election with even more tax cuts for the rich.  Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/04/budgetary_smoke.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes a very nice op-ed from the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/16/AR2006041600685.html">Washington Post</a>: <br />
<blockquote>But when Congress comes back from its recess, it&#8217;s expected to take up a deal to extend President Bush&#8217;s capital gains and dividend tax cuts. To make their budget-busting tax policy appear less costly than it is, the lawmakers are resorting to a gimmick that is even more egregious than their usual tactics.  This one would, as usual, hide the cost of tax cuts that primarily benefit upper-income Americans. But it would accomplish that budgetary smoke and mirrors with a new tax provision, involving retirement savings accounts, that also benefits the well-to-do. And, to top things off, this new tax provision, while masking the cost of the tax cuts by bringing in more revenue in the short term, would in the long run worsen the fiscal situation by piling on more debt. No one who&#8217;s serious about controlling the deficit &#8211; whatever one&#8217;s position on extending the tax cuts &#8211; could support this dishonest approach.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/goldblatt200604170627.asp">Mark Goldblatt</a> finds evidence of the Laffer curve in the behavior of a cartoon character named Chadwick Worthington III.  Goldblatt also adds this tired old canard:<br />
<blockquote>After President Kennedy cut the top tax rate from 90 percent down to 70 percent, actual tax revenues rose from 94 billion dollars in 1961 to 153 billion in 1968. After President Reagan initiated across-the-board tax cuts, overall tax revenues jumped from $599 billion in 1981 to $909 billion in 1988. President Bush&#8217;s tax cuts seemed, at first, to break the pattern. Before he came into office, in 2000, tax revenues stood at a record $2,025 billion. They shrank to $1,991 billion in 2001, the first year of Bush&#8217;s presidency (and the year of the 9/11 attacks) . . . then shrank to $1853 billion in 2002 . . . then shrank to $1,782 billion in 2003. But that was the bottom. Tax revenues rose to $1,880 in 2004. The Congressional Budget Office estimates tax revenues for 2005 will hit $2,154 billion &#8211; in other words, the government is now hauling in more money in taxes than it ever has before. This would be impossible if &#8220;tax cuts for the rich&#8221; meant less overall tax revenues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit">Toontown</a>, the characters understand concepts such as real taxes per capita and Keynesian business cycles, but not Mr. Goldblatt!</p>

                                <p>The spot price for Cushing, OK WTI just hit $70 per barrel.  Edit: Spot prices were briefly above $70 last year due to Hurricane Katrina.</p>

<p>Dr. Nouriel Roubini suggests that $70 oil may have a significant impact on the US economy:<br />
<blockquote>&#8221; &#8230; if oil prices were to drift towards $70 and stay there for the rest of 2006 &#8211; as I expect they may &#8230;  &#8211; the effects on global growth and inflation would be more serious and significant than the effects of rising oil prices in 2004 and 2005.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  Here is Dr. Roubini&#8217;s <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/123823">post</a>: Why Oil at $70 Would Have Serious Negative Effects on U.S. and Global Economic Growth.  Dr. Roubini presents five reasons why he believes $70 oil will impact the US economy.  From reason #2:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230; the last thing that a shopped-out consumer with negative savings and increasing debt and debt service ratios needs now is higher oil and energy prices at the time when the housing bubble is fizzling out and the purchasing power support provided by mortgage equity withdrawals is also fizzling out. The U.S. consumer will not survive unscathed the triple whammy of a housing bubble flattening, oil prices surging and short and long term interest rates rising.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  This is potentially why the housing slowdown may have a larger impact on the economy than some people realize.  Many homeowners have been using their homes as an &#8220;ATM&#8221;.  Perhaps last year people believed that higher energy prices would be a short duration problem, and they borrowed to maintain their lifestyle.  This year, they might not have that luxury.  </p>
<p>Also, Dr. Setser adds his <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/124164">thoughts</a>: Abridged Roubini on oil at $70 &#8212; and not-so-abridged Setser on Petrodollars</p>
<p>Who knows if $70 oil will hold (or even go higher).  WTI has fallen to $69.93 as I&#8217;ve written this post.  </p>

                                <p>If you are wondering what the Hamilton Project is – go <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/es/hamilton/hamilton_hp.htm">here</a>. On April 12, <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/js4178.htm">John Snow</a> states:<br />
<blockquote>On the one hand are those who believe that the future of our economy is best served by a larger role for government in the economy. On the other side are those, like myself, who maintain that while the role of government is to create the conditions for prosperity, the citizens and taxpayers are the best judge of how to spend their own money, not the government. One view necessitates higher taxes, a more expansive role for government, and more government spending. The other holds that low tax rates, a reduced role for government and a vibrant private sector is the best path to prosperity for all Americans. Recently the former view was exemplified in a presentation in Washington by a number of past officials of the previous Administration. They styled their undertaking the so-called &#8220;Hamilton Project,&#8221; drawing on the name of the first U.S. Treasury Secretary. Based on what was said, it appears that Hamilton&#8217;s name may have been misappropriated.  Hamilton after all was foremost among the founding fathers in seeing that the new republic&#8217;s future depended upon the vitality of commerce and the private sector while the authors of the Hamilton Project argue for a larger government role. The stated goal of this group was to put policy for our economy on a course &#8220;diametrically opposed to the current policy regime,&#8221; calling the current path &#8220;on the wrong track on almost every front.&#8221; They argued for a deceptively simple approach as an alternative, calling for both &#8220;fiscal discipline, and for increased public investment in key growth-enhancing areas.&#8221; Well, if you do the math, growing the public sector&#8211;that is, making government bigger&#8211;and achieving fiscal discipline, can only lead to one thing: higher taxes.   And higher taxes always mean a larger role for government and a smaller role for the private sector.  Is that the way we want to go?  I don&#8217;t think so. They also claim to want economic growth to be &#8220;broad based.&#8221; But, they intend a recipe of more government and higher taxes that is antithetical to growth itself. In that scenario, the only way for some to have more, is for others to do with less. That sounds to me like nothing more than the same old &#8220;class warfare.&#8221;  Hamilton on the other hand saw the boundless opportunity for all to benefit from an expanding economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Snow continues with the usual propaganda about how great the economy is doing.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/04/special_john_sn.html">Brad DeLong</a> starts his reply to this garbage from the “worst Treasury Secretary in living memory” with a history lesson:<br />
<blockquote>Does John Snow really have no clue that Hamilton believed that a big, activist government&#8211;regulating the financial system, supporting science and industry, encouraging manufactures, assuming the national debt&#8211;was essential for the health of the American economy? Is it really the case that nobody in John Snow&#8217;s entourage knows that Hamilton was always on the &#8220;big government&#8221; side in his fights with Jefferson? That Jefferson believed that a big government was a threat to liberty, but that Hamilton did no&#8211;Hamilton was not interested in either big government or small government per se but rather in effective government?</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s also recall what Sec. Hamilton said in the First Report on the Public Credit, 1790:</p>
<blockquote><p>Persuaded, as the Secretary is, that the proper funding of the present debt will render it a national blessing, yet he is so far from acceding to the position, in the latitude in which it is sometimes laid down, that &#8220;public debts are public benefits&#8221; &#8211; a position inviting to prodigality and liable to dangerous abuse &#8211; that he ardently wishes to see it incorporated as a fundamental maxim in the system of public credit of the United States, that the creation of debt should always be accompanied with the means of extinguishment. This he regards as the true secret /or rendering public credit immortal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sec. Robert Rubin understood this fundamental maxim, but Sec. Snow seems to have forgotten it – alas! Sec. Snow also seems to not understand two facts.  The share of GDP going to government spending is higher today than it was in 2000 and the share of GDP captured by investment spending is lower than it was in 2000.  The lack of fiscal responsibility embedded in the Bush Administration’s phony claim that they are “giving us our money back” clearly has something to do with the reduction in national savings.  It is too bad that our current Treasury Secretary fails to understand what Secretary Hamilton and Secretary Rubin realized.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_nugent/nugent200604130817.asp">Thomas Nugent</a> coins a new term &#8211; Graham-Schumer-push inflation only after he tells us that the labor market is wonderful:<br />
<blockquote>Heretofore, the gloom-and-doom crowd fixated on the slow creation of jobs during this economic cycle and on the idea that outsourcing and illegal immigration were combining to steal American jobs. But at the current unemployment rate of 4.7 percent, any argument that the economy is not creating enough jobs can only be met with laughter.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry Thomas – but we can only meet your ignorance of the fact that the labor force participation rate and the employment-population ratio are both lower today than before Bush took office with laughter, but let’s move on:<br />
<blockquote>One reason why inflation has remained low is the proliferation of low-cost imports from China. By building a dynamic manufacturing base complemented by low-cost labor, China has become a major U.S. trading partner. Since China’s growth rate is one of the fastest among industrialized economies, the Chinese government’s monetary policy has been one of price stability. To achieve this stability, the Chinese have benchmarked their currency relative to the dollar and, as such, have enjoyed strong economic growth and low inflation. This policy has also tended to keep interest rates low in the U.S., as the Chinese have invested close to $1 trillion of dollar reserves in U.S. government securities.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see – inflation in China is low because its rate of monetary growth is so high.  I’m sorry to laugh as we really need to get to your thesis:<br />
<blockquote>Imagine what would happen if Graham-Schumer, or any of our elected federal officials, are successful in “retaliating” against China. If this is the case, U.S. consumers will have to absorb the price increases that would come with the importation of Chinese goods. Given our heavy imports from China, a rise in the prices of domestic goods and services would undoubtedly push the traditional measures of inflation a lot higher. Since the Fed doesn’t ask questions, and only reacts to rising prices, a pop in the inflation numbers would mean tighter money and higher interest rates. Meanwhile, if the Chinese retaliate against our retaliation, either through tariffs or quotas, then more than a few American laborers will be put out of work. Such a downward spiral in standards of living in the name of fighting inflation would not be welcome by most Americans. Key Chinese politicians are visiting the U.S. over the next few weeks in an attempt to mollify politicians and keep the yuan from a free float. Chinese resistance to these pressures may be weakening and a change in their policy may be in the offing. If not, and if a 27.5 percent tariff on Chinese imports makes it into law, economists will have the opportunity to stick a new catch phrase on inflation. Demand-push? Cost-push? Try Graham-Schumer-push.</p></blockquote>
<p>My head is spinning.  Prices of Chinese imports will rise because of the tariff.  OK – that might be right.  But as we consumers buy American goods instead of Chinese goods, U.S. employment will decline.  <strong>HUH?</strong>  And the higher unemployment will lead to more inflation?  Was Nugent drunk when he wrote this?</p>
<p>If Mr. Nugent is hoping that the Chinese government decides to let the yuan float so as to accomplish an <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/expenditure-switching.html">expenditure-switching</a> shift in demand away from Chinese goods and towards U.S. goods, let me echo this hope.  Of course, such a devaluation of the dollar would increase the price of goods purchased from China – just as a tariff would do. </p>
<p>OK, I&#8217;m not in favor  Graham-Schumer on the microeconomic grounds that it is an inefficient way of achieving a macroeconomic end with currency realignment being a preferred means of achieving the macroeconomic end.  If there are any macroeconomic differences between these two means to this end, Mr. Nugent does not present them.  </p>
<p>However, the <a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2006/04/imf_how_has_glo.html">New Economist</a> offers us chapter 3 of the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2006/01/index.htm">World Economic Outlook</a> and notes:<br />
<blockquote>IMF staff estimate that on average globalisation has reduced inflation through the channel of non-oil import prices by around ¼ percentage point a year in the advanced economies, with a larger effect of ½ percentage point a year in the US. But, as noted, these import effects are neither regular nor persistent, and so cannot be relied upon to prevent higher inflation in the period ahead. Globalisation is &#8220;no guarantee of low inflation over the next year or two&#8221;, as &#8220;robust global growth and diminishing economic slack have reduced the restraining impact of declining import prices on inflation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Limiting free trade does impact relative prices and may have very modest albeit temporary effects on inflation – that’s true.  As is the premise that lower unemployment (not higher as Mr. Nugent suggested) would tend to offset any deflationary effects from declining import prices.</p>

                                <p>On March 31, <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/03/index.html">David Altig</a> discussed <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/es/commentary/journals/bpea_macro/forum/200603bpea_aaronson.pdf">this paper</a> by Stephanie Aaronson, Bruce Fallick, Andrew Figura, Jonathan Pingle and William Wascher:<br />
<blockquote>On balance, the results suggest that most of the decline in the participation rate during and immediately following the 2001 recession was a response to business cycle developments. However, the continued decline in participation in subsequent years and the absence of a significant rebound in 2005 appears to reflect other more structural factors.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/04/a_slowdown_in_b.html">Mark Thoma</a> notes <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=71000001&#038;sid=a6Sdd680grwE&#038;refer=fed_watch">this review</a> from Bloomberg:<br />
<blockquote>A Federal Reserve study is shaking economists&#8217; forecasts by suggesting U.S. economic growth will have to decelerate more over the next decade than most expect &#8230; The study projects a slower pace of workforce growth than most economists now forecast, suggesting the economy can&#8217;t keep growing at the present-day pace without generating pressure for higher wages and inflation. To prevent that, the Fed will have to enforce a lower speed limit on the economy by pushing up interest rates.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/2005-3_archives/000566.html">Baker, DeLong, and Krugman</a> discussed one aspect of this possible slowdown in population growth – the implications for asset returns:<br />
<blockquote>Simple standard closed-economy growth models predict that growth slowdowns are likely to lower the marginal product of capital, and thus the long-run rate of return. </p></blockquote>
<p>During the blog discussion that preceded this paper, I had mused about the role of the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/02/luskin-on-krugman-before-don-learned.html">Solow growth model</a>:<br />
<blockquote>If population growth declines and national savings rates stay the same, the logic has it that we will enjoy capital deepening, which would predict a fell in the return to capital consistent with Dean Baker’s financial modeling.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – less population growth along with continued national savings (assuming the Bush fiscal train wreck is eventually reversed) means rising capital to labor ratios and increasing real wages as the Bloomberg piece suggests.  But I don’t know why Bloomberg thinks rising per capita income is a problem or would be inflationary.</p>
