                                <p>While I profess to being a Keynesian economist, I have never bought into the notion that fiscal stimulus is the only way to reverse a recession.  <a href="http://www.tompaine.com/articles/2006/04/12/what_recovery.php">Max Sawicky</a> &#8211; who may be more Keynesian than yours truly – writes:<br />
<blockquote>My question in all this, which no conservatives are rushing to answer, is this: What sequence of economic events would it take since the end of recession in 2001 to lead you to conclude that the tax cuts have failed?  If none, and failure is conceptually impossible, then naturally one must conclude that the tax cuts have succeeded.  The economic recovery would have occurred at some pace in any case.  Can it be said that this recovery was markedly superior to those of the past? That question has already been answered, not least in a paper by Lee Price for the Economic Policy Institute.  He shows conclusively that in almost every dimension, the course of the economy since 2001 has been worse than in previous recoveries. It is true that at present the unemployment rate of 4.7 percent looks good.  Unfortunately, this rate glosses over the extent of labor market drop-outs &#8211; anyone too discouraged by the recession to look for work &#8211; who are not counted as unemployed under the official definitions.  That aside, the rate does not prove the tax cuts work.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Max and I agree that we have yet to reach full employment.  And it is refreshing to see Keynesian Max noting that we would have seen a recovery even in the absence of a tax cut.  Of course, those who argue we need a permanent tax cut to maintain aggregate demand near full employment likely never read the <em>General Theory</em> in the first place.</p>

                                <p>This is one of those milestones (in some ways like the Dow breaching 10,000) that obviously means nothing from a strictly financial point of view, but is an important psychological threshold.  If nothing else, this news draws our attention to the real story, which is the slow but steady upward march of interest rates that we&#8217;ve seen in recent months.<br />
<blockquote><strong>Yield on 10-year note climbs above 5%</strong></p>
<p>NEW YORK (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B608E407F-9CED-41F6-990B-AAD6345920F5%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; Treasury prices were under pressure Thursday, pushing the 10-year yield above 5% for the first time in nearly four years, as unexpectedly strong retail sales and consumer-sentiment data advanced a case for the Federal Reserve to keep lifting rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>This rise in rates reflects a belief that the economy will continue to remain strong through the rest of the year.  That belief pushes long-term interest rates higher due to three factors, which are all interrelated.  A rough attempt at disentangling their relative importance is presented in the following picture.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/rates_apr06b.jpg"></p>
<p>First, a stronger economy will persuade the Fed to keep raising short-term interest rates.  Higher short-term rates (the red line on the graph above) tends to push up long-term rates, since people tend to demand at least as high a rate of interest on longer deposits as they&#8217;re getting on short-term deposits.</p>
<p>Second, a stronger economy will tend to cause inflation to rise.  If prices are expected to rise more, then investors will demand a higher rate of interest to compensate them.</p>
<p>Finally, a stronger economy will tend to cause the real (i.e. after inflation) rate of return to rise, since the demand for borrowed funds will typically be greater during a period of strong economic growth.</p>
<p>The graph above illustrates that much of the recent rise in long-term rates is due to this final effect.  Since the end of January, the yields on inflation-adjusted bonds (TIPS) have risen almost as much as yields on nominal bonds, suggesting that the rise in nominal bond yields is not primarily due to fears of higher future inflation.  </p>
<p>As for the effects of these higher long-term interest rates on the economy&#8230; I would suggest paying close attention to the <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/060413/nyth032.html?.v=50">real estate market</a>.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett200604120758.asp">Bruce Bartlett</a> has been invited to contribute to the National Review:<br />
<blockquote>The question is ambiguous because it is not clear whether people are being asked about the effective rate of taxation (taxes as a share of income) or the marginal rate of taxation (that which applies to the last dollar earned). But either way, taxes are much higher than people think they should be. According to the poll, 24 percent of people think all taxes should take less than 10 percent of a person’s income. Another 43 percent think they should take less than 20 percent and an additional 22 percent of people think the tax burden should be no more than 30 percent of income. In other words, two-thirds of Americans think that 19 percent is the most anyone should pay while 90 percent think a tax rate of 29 percent should be the maximum. How does this stack up against actual tax burdens? One way to look at this is to take taxes at all levels of government as a share of the gross domestic product — the nation’s total income. In 2005, taxes came to a little over $3.5 trillion and GDP was close to $12.5 trillion, for an effective tax rate of 28.5 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess anything that gets the numbers right represents a contribution in terms of the low standards of the National Review and Bruce is certainly right to add this forward looking statement:<br />
<blockquote>Unfortunately, taxes are going up because of the vast government spending in the pipeline due to the aging of society. In the end, I think people will accept higher taxes rather than cut spending enough to prevent that necessity.</p></blockquote>
<p>After all, not enough conservatives are admitting the deficits represent deferred taxation and the expected future increases in entitlement spending (as a share of GDP) means the fiscal imbalance will only grow if we don’t either raise tax rates or massively reduce spending.  But let me toss this tidbit in – disposable income equals taxes paid minus transfer payments received.  Over the long-term, net taxes must equal government purchases, which were about 19% of GDP in 2005.  And if we cut entitlements to reduce the deficit, don’t net taxes rise?</p>

<blockquote>Iran, which is defying United Nations Security Council demands to cease its nuclear program, may be capable of making a nuclear bomb within 16 days if it goes ahead with plans to install thousands of centrifuges at its Natanz plant, a U.S. State Department official said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does this scare you into wanting to declare war on Iran TODAY?  It scares me for a very different reason as noted by <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/008209.php">Josh Marshall</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Now, I&#8217;m pretty new to this issue. But even I can spot that Stephen Rademaker works for Robert Joseph.  And that&#8217;s the same Bob Joseph who was charged with muscling the CIA into letting President Bush use the Niger bamboozle in the 2003 State of the Union address.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem we are coming into another election where Karl Rove has to pull another rabbit out of the hat.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2006/04/iran-can-now-make-glowing-mickey-mouse.html">Juan Cole</a> reports:<br />
<blockquote>the fact is that all President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Tuesday was that it had enriched uranium to a measely 3.5 percent, using a bank of 180 centrifuges hooked up so that they &#8220;cascade.&#8221; The ability to slightly enrich uranium is not the same as the ability to build a bomb. For the latter, you need at least 80% enrichment, which in turn would require about 16,000 small centrifuges hooked up to cascade. Iran does not have 16,000 centrifuges. It seems to have 180. Iran is a good ten years away from having a bomb, and since its leaders, including Supreme Jurisprudent Ali Khamenei, say they do not want an atomic bomb because it is Islamically immoral, you have to wonder if they will ever have a bomb.The crisis is not one of nuclear enrichment, a low-level attainment that does not necessarily lead to having a bomb. Even if Iran had a bomb, it is hard to see how they could be more dangerous than Communist China, which has lots of such bombs, and whose Walmart stores are a clever ruse to wipe out the middle class American family through funneling in cheaply made Chinese goods.</p></blockquote>
<p>Walmart and our imports from China tied into this phony war mongering garbage from the White House.  CLEVER!</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2006/04/berlusconi_econ.html">New Economist</a> predicted the failure of the Berlusconi coalition:<br />
<blockquote>But these all take second place to Silvio Berlusconi&#8217;s central crime since his coalition came to power in May 2001: economic mismanagement. As the German economy has steadily improved its competitiveness and boosted exports in recent years, Italy has lost a lot of ground.</p></blockquote>
<p>This post notes the incredibly low GDP growth even in the face of rising government spending.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/rocca200604111043.asp">Francis Rocca</a> of NRO similarly suggests that Berlusconi fared poorly because of the economy:<br />
<blockquote>With growth at barely more than zero, unemployment over 8 percent, and the national debt at 108.5 percent of GDP in 2005, Italians are scared. The manufacturing industries that were the engine of Italy&#8217;s boom in the 1950s and 1960s, and which are largely responsible for its position today as the world&#8217;s seventh biggest economy, now face fierce competition from China and other East Asian countries. A rapidly aging nation with one of the lowest fertility rates in the world, Italy urgently needs to reform its pay-as-you-go pension system and rationalize its immigration policies. Of course, this is not all, or even mostly, the fault of Silvio Berlusconi.</p></blockquote>
<p>So beyond increasing in government spending from an allegedly conservative government, what were Berlusconi’s economic policies?  Almost a year ago, the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/05/18/news/berlusconi.php">International Herald Tribune</a> had this rather prophetic article:<br />
<blockquote>Elected on a growth platform, Berlusconi promised the kind of liberalizing initiatives that Margaret Thatcher gave Britain in the 1980s. Four years into his second term as Italy&#8217;s prime minister, the public sector remains badly bloated and the crisis in the country&#8217;s pensions system has, if anything, deepened. Last week, Italy fell into recession for the second time in two years, even as Germany, another struggling economy, showed better-than-expected growth. Berlusconi &#8220;promised a new economic miracle but the situation actually got worse,&#8221; said Francesco Daveri, an economics professor at the University of Parma. Odds of a turnaround seem remote. Italy&#8217;s productivity has been slipping since 2000 and for experts like Daveri, Berlusconi&#8217;s lackluster economic record adds up to likely defeat at the next election. &#8220;People don&#8217;t want to be fooled by promises,&#8221; Daveri said. Nonetheless, Berlusconi has stuck by some pledges, for example by raising the retirement age to 60 from 57 in the face of opposition from unions. He approved tax incentives for small companies to merge with each other and better financing for research and development to help Italian competitiveness. Berlusconi is also credited with keeping the country&#8217;s joblessness under control. About 8 percent of Italians are unemployed &#8211; more than the 5 percent in Britain but far fewer than rates above 10 percent in Germany and France. Even so, changes have been less remarkable and less effective than promised. Italy&#8217;s economy last year grew at 1.2 percent, well under the euro zone average of 2 percent, and the country&#8217;s manufacturing base is not evolving fast enough toward high-technology manufacturing to compete with Asia&#8217;s powerhouses. </p></blockquote>
<p>Berlusconi has been compared to Bush in several ways.  Thatcher &#038; Berlusconi and Reagan and George W. Bush: tax cuts not offset by reduction in government spending sold as free-lunch supply-side economics.  Sorry – but I could not resist this analogy.</p>

<blockquote>When I talk to people about the sad state of the Bush administration lately, we always ask ourselves, “Well, what can he do now?” … I have come up with (an admittedly thin) seven-point plan of action:</p>
<p>Accept an enforcement-only immigration bill. This is a no-brainer. Bush can say, “Look, I love immigrants and we should welcome them, but the only consensus that exists at the moment is for enforcement. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m signing a tough enforcement bill, which will enhance our security at a time we face a dire terrorist threat. But I have also extracted a blood-oath commitment from the GOP leadership in the House and the Senate that a proposal for a guest-worker program and bringing illegals out of shadows will be a priority in the new Congress. Once we have better control of our borders, I am confident we can pass sensible, comprehensive, compassionate legislation on this issue,” etc., etc.</p>
<p>Give some speeches denouncing eminent domain abuse. He can&#8217;t do anything about it, of course, but the Republican base will love it and it&#8217;s a broadly popular issue, so no one else will be offended.</p>
<p>Talk about the economy as much as possible, and get a new treasury secretary to try to shift the conversation onto this topic (although I don&#8217;t think John Snow is in anyway to blame for the administration&#8217;s failed PR campaign on this front).</p>
<p>Endorse the Ponnuru tax reform plan. Ramesh can spell it out more, but it basically involves an enormous expansion of the child tax credit. It can&#8217;t go anywhere this year, but for a party that desperately needs substantive issues to talk about&#8211;and ones that aren&#8217;t unpopular&#8211;it&#8217;s a pretty good place to land for the time being.</p>
<p>Push for the confirmation of his circuit judges that are pending. Talk about them by name. The GOP wins judiciary fights.</p>
<p>Veto a spending bill. It will make him look strong, and the GOP base will love it. It will embarrass the GOP congress, but, hey, they deserve it, and ultimately the congressional GOP gains when Bush gains.</p>
<p>Sit-down with conservative bloggers. They are some of his most loyal supporters-include them in the media out-reach.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll admit that I’m no match to the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/11/karl-rove-is-evil-genius.html">Evil Genius</a> when it comes to partisan politics, so let me stick to the policy aspects of proposals 1, 3, 4, and 6 (#2 and #7 are just sound bite nonsense).  On #3, Lowry is correct – the Treasury Secretary cannot be blamed for the failure PR campaign since he has echoed Karl Rove’s spin whenever possible.  The Administration might wish to blame some of its own economic policies – but under Karl Rove, Treasury Secretaries don’t seem to be part of the policy making process.  Alas. </p>
<p>#4 seems to be more of the same – pass more deferrals of our tax liabilities, which is pandering at best and fiscally irresponsible at worst.  But I just might agree with Lowry on #6 – let’s see some fiscal backbone from the White House for once ESPECIALLY if the veto is designed to reign in the Tom DeLay pork barrel spending machine.  Ah, but Karl Rove knows reducing this type of pork might cost the GOP some votes.  Never mind.  </p>
<p>Which brings us to #1 &#8211; which essentially is to give up on what may be George W. Bush’s signature issue.   I might disagree with a few of the details of what Bush is proposing to do in regards immigration reform, but at least the compassionate half of “compassionate conservative” seems to be something that predates Bush’s political career even before he was the GOP nominee in 2000.  In my view, George W. Bush has precious view principled positions, which is why I find it odd that Lowry began his list by recommending that Bush abandon the only one that seems to be left in his Presidency.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.tnr.com/user/nregi.mhtml?i=w060410&#038;s=lizza04106&#038;pt=FEyuLds7UPfBjAy166P08C%3D%3D">Ryan Lizza</a> also offers some advice to President Bush, which drew the following comment from <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_04/008606.php">Kevin Drum</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Well, OK. Except that Bush is fundamentally incompetent and he does govern for the benefit of a handful of Republican special interests. How does one &#8220;overcome&#8221; one&#8217;s very raison d&#8217;etre? On the other hand, I like the idea of shipping Bush off to Baghdad for the rest of his term. He could start a blog and report back regularly on all the progress we&#8217;re making.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ouch!</p>
<p><strong><em>Update II</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/lowry/lowry200604110751.asp">Rich Lowry</a> follows-up his first partisan proposal with flat out lying about Democrats:<br />
<blockquote>Democrats opposed the ratification of the Central America Free Trade Agreement last year for fear that it would undercut American workers made to compete with cheap Latin American labor &#8230; Bizarrely, it is the Democrats who most strongly support a lax immigration system that acts as a subsidy to business interests eager to hire workers at the lowest wages possible and to upper-middle-class Americans who don’t want to pay too much to have someone mow their lawns.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe SOME Democrats opposed CAFTA fearing free trade but THIS Democrat opposed CAFTA precisely because it was not riddled with movements away from free markets.  But to suggest that it is the fault of the Democrats in the Senate for Frist’s failure to work with Reid on shoring up the bipartisan compromise is the kind of dishonesty that Rich Lowry excels at.  No, the National Review does not care about real reform – it only cares about raw partisan politics.</p>

<p>WASHINGTON (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B7F74606B-DD80-44A4-B5B8-047C6D5D42E1%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; After several years of low interest rates and ample liquidity, storm clouds are developing over global financial markets, according to a new report from the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p>Although the global financial system has gathered strength and resilience in 2005, &#8220;a number of cyclical challenges appear to be gathering on the horizon, which necessitates a more nuanced view of the financial outlook for the remainder of 2006 and beyond,&#8221; the study, called the Global Financial Stability Report, concluded.</p>
<p>Despite the worries, continuation of sunny skies was still the baseline forecast of IMF researchers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The most likely cyclical setting for financial markets in 2006 could be defined as &#8216;not bad, but not as good as the stellar year 2005,&#8217; the report concluded.  But the storm clouds are mounting and questions remain about how fast they might arrive and whether financial systems will be able to handle any added stress.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The core economic issue is this: in the midst of a &#8220;chicken&#8221; game, which verbal cues should lead you to conclude that things are going well (poorly) for your side? … How about this?  We make lots of noise, hoping to scare Iran.  If the noise doesn&#8217;t work (which it won&#8217;t) then we might feel we must attack, having put our credibility on the line.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002127.html">Barkley</a> is less optimistic:<br />
<blockquote>Tyler Cowin on Marginal Revolution has linked to this article and compared the whole thing to a game of chicken, arguing that maybe the US policymakers do not really want to bomb, but are semi-secretly trying to scare the Iranians into not doing anything. The problem is, as I have previously noted, that this looks very much like the pre-Iraq-war hubbub over WMD. Saddam had stopped their programs, but nobody in the US believed him because of his previous lying.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m even less optimistic for the following reason.  We did play this game of chicken with Saddam and he blinked.  We were not relying on his good word as part of this game was for Saddam to let the UN inspectors back in.  When Saddam blinked, he was letting the inspectors do their job and they were not finding any WMDs.  But then some madman in the White House decided on March 19, 2003 to start a war anyway.  If that same madman is Commander-in-Chief, there is a bit of a flaw in Tyler’s theory.</p>

<blockquote>The staggering costs of Sarbox bear repeating. An analysis by Sarbanes-Oxley Ivy Xiying Zhang of the University of Rochester measured the total stock market impact of the law, and found that it has cost over $1 trillion, with a “T.” About a third of that cost can be attributed to direct compliance costs, while the remainder is the result of the economic inefficiencies created by the law. Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman recently told the New York Sun that Sarbanes-Oxley is the biggest problem facing the U.S. economy today, noting that it tells entrepreneurs, “Don’t take chances because down will come the hatchet. We’re going to knock your head off.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://w4.stern.nyu.edu/accounting/docs/speaker_papers/spring2005/Zhang_Ivy_Economic_Consequences_of_S_O.pdf">Ivy Xiying Zhang</a> paper is discussed by <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/06/how_much_does_s.html">The Big Picture</a>:<br />
<blockquote>There&#8217;s a meme circulating now amongst the sloping forehead crowd that Sarbanes-Oxley costs exceed $1.4 trillion dollars. The way that was calculated was the drop in stock market market capitilization during July 2002 when the legislation was passed. Somehow, SOX gets the entire responsibility for that July 2002 sell off; Even more amusing, SOX gets none of the credit for any subsequent rise in market capitilization since then &#8211; it simply gets ignored; Further, this researcher thinks that the only factor impacting market action was Congressional legislation &#8212; and not all legislation, just SOX.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nysun.com/article/29551">NY Sun</a> did interview Milton Friedman as did <a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&#038;name=ViewPrint&#038;articleId=10764">Robert Kuttner</a>:<br />
<blockquote>RK: So how does that translate when you are talking about financial markets, where if the last round of scandals is any indication, insiders just were in a position to fool investors, and it eventually self-corrected, but it did a fair amount of damage in the meantime. <br />MF: Yes it did and you didn’t note that it self corrected before government got involved. Enron wasn’t brought to surface by the government. It was brought to the surface by the market <br />RK: Well but the whole business of financial advisors also being investment bankers was brought to surface by [New York Attorney General] Eliot Spitzer, so it was some government and some prosecution. It certainly wasn’t the SEC. The SEC was asleep at the switch if anything. <br />MF: Yes, and it has been mostly since. <br />RK: Right. But one of the paradoxes here is that the law and economics movement seems to be in favor of restricting some rights of private remedy even as its in favor of reducing regulation. <br />MF: I’m not sure what you are referring to <br />RK: Well I’m referring to both the writings of some prominent law and economics people, but also the 1995 and 1998 amendments that made it harder for individual investors to bring suits claiming that they were defrauded by the representations of people selling securities and the accountants signing off on offerings, and that sort of thing. <br />MF: I’m not an expert on that area. I don’t know what those amendments were. You’ve got me out of my depth.<br />RK: Well, let’s come back to the SEC. In general, well, what did you think of Sarbanes-Oxley? Was that overkill? Or was that a reasonable…. <br />MF: I think Sarbanes-Oxley is a terrible law. <br />RK: Because…? <br />MF: Here you say to every CEO in the country: you’ve got to swear to the accuracy of things you can’t possibly know. You’re going to make a perjurer of him. And you say to him, for God sakes whatever you do, don’t take risks. We’ve been having something of a slowdown, not in the economy as a whole thanks to the housing boom. But in what I describe as the healthy party of the economy: manufacturing, services, etc., the free market part of the economy. And one of the reasons why I think we’ve been having this slow down is because Sarbanes-Oxley is saying to CEOs, for god sakes don’t take any risks. And yet progress depends on doing risk. You can’t make an omelet without breaking some eggs. <br />RK: But the whole system of independent accounting firms certifying to the accuracy of corporate books came crashing down in the 90’s. Do you think the private market was capable of repairing that? <br />MF: I really have never studied that problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since Professor Friedman is honest enough to admit that the economics behind the Sarbanes-Oxley debate is not his expertise, I would hope others who know even less about these issues would cease citing him as an authority on this particular matter.</p>

                                <p>First, it was <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/04/09/be-nice-to-the-man-with-the-double-barrel-shotgun">William Kristol</a>.  As Jane Hamsher notes:<br />
<blockquote>Many people have assumed that BushCo. hasn’t gone into smear mode because of their previous praise of Fitzgerald, to which I say balderdash.  They’d frame Mother Theresa for pedophelia if it suited their purposes.  It’s what they know how to do.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/000325.php">Justin Hood</a> catches GOP hack Joseph E. diGenova advocating a Presidential pardon for Scooter Libby.  The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-leakassess9apr09,0,3841741.story?coll=la-home-headlines">LA Times</a> story also included:<br />
<blockquote>Some Republicans predicted that the issue would go nowhere. &#8220;This needs to play out over the next seven days,&#8221; said Joseph E. diGenova, a federal prosecutor under President Reagan. &#8220;This is just inside-the-Beltway stuff. If Republicans stick with [Bush], it will become a partisan issue and people will turn it off.&#8221; … Moreover, DiGenova said, the White House has dismissed questions stemming from the special prosecutor&#8217;s investigation with the explanation that it can&#8217;t comment on an ongoing legal case. &#8220;They&#8217;re not coming to their own defense,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>The White House is not coming to their own defense?  Then exactly who is putting Mr. DiGenova and Mr. Kristol up to these attacks on Mr. Fitzgerald?</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200604100004">Media Matters</a> contrasts William Kristol now to the 1998 defense of Ken Starr by guess who – William Kristol!</p>
