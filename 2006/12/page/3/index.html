                                <p>Dean Baker’s subtitle for <a href="http://www.conservativenannystate.org/">The Conservative Nanny State</a> is How the Wealthy Use the Government to Stay Rich and Get Richer.  My attempt to explain why the prescription drug benefit is so massively expensive relative to the benefits it brings seniors has to do with titling the incidence of this subsidy toward suppliers.  But how did this law do this, you may ask?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/12/medicare_drug_plan_the_conserv.html#014925">Dean</a> brings us a story by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/washington/27medicare.html?_r=1&#038;ref=us&#038;oref=slogin">Robert Pear</a> noting that (Dean’s summary):<br />
<blockquote>some of the insurance companies in the Medicare drug plan failed to notify seniors of changes in their plan. These changes often involve higher prices and the dropping of some drugs from the plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean continues:<br />
<blockquote>The brave men and women who occupy Congress say that the insurance and drug industry have too much power to allow for a Medicare sponsored drug plan. So, we compromise. We put in place an efficient user-friendly system and then cut the insurance and pharmaceutical industries checks for the amount of profit that they would have made off the taxpayers under the current system. The system is called &#8220;Temporary Assistance for Needy Corporations (TANC).&#8221; The companies that are unable to compete in the market will get checks for their lost profits from the government for 10 years. This will allow their CEOs to still get multi-million dollar compensation packages and their shareholders will still get big dividends, the big benefit for the public will be that seniors won&#8217;t have to deal with so much nonsense when trying to get the health care that they need.</p></blockquote>
<p>A few principled conservatives objected to expanding transfer payments in this way.  Some of us on the left also objected to the nature of this program which allowed for much of the taxpayer funded subsidy to be captured by suppliers.  Of course, President Bush is trying to tell us that we can have the new subsidy and not raise taxes on anyone.  My real objection comes from such free lunch dishonesty.  Someone in the future will be responsible for paying taxes on all these goodies.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Some folks think just about everything should be left to the private sector, some think that government should do a lot more.  Presumably, that must mean there are big differences between a modern American corporation, say, and a government.</p>
<p>A believer in the private sector can name a few:</p>
<p>1.  One is the profit motive.  In theory, corporations exist to maximize profits for their shareholders.  Of course, in theory, a country exists to maximize the well-being of its citizens.  Some, such as Sweden, apparently do a good job.  Others, like North Korea, are abysmal.  But even the Swedens leave a lot on the table.  The same is true of corporations.  Partly this is true because the profit motive doesn&#8217;t really apply to all the employees.  (If you&#8217;ve ever worked for a Fortune 500 company, you know the waste and inefficiency have a DMV-like magnitude.)  Usually, a few guys at the top get a lot of stock options that are supposed to align their interests with those of the shareholder, but most do not so their incentives may be very different.  In fact, even the CEO&#8217;s incentive may not be aligned with that of shareholders.  It isn&#8217;t possible to positively identify each person&#8217;s contribution, so if nothing else, the incentive to free ride is always there.<br />2.  Closely tied to the profit motive is the fact that underperforming corporations can be taken over or go out of business.  But so can underperforming countries &#8211; the USSR, for one, is gone.  So is East Germany.  And who would be shocked if North Korea didn&#8217;t exist in 10 years, other than a few million kept-in-the-dark North Koreans?  And corporations don&#8217;t exactly go under all that easily.  Ford and GM are still around.  They&#8217;ll probably still be around for a while.<br />3.  There are limits to the powers of the corporation.  Giving a non-performing employee a beating is generally frowned upon in Corporate America.  But in most countries, the executive is not the final arbiter of what is legal.  For all practical purposes, it was the final arbiter in the old USSR, and GW has argued that he is the decider when it comes to anything he thinks is related to the War on Terror, but for the most part, there is a legal system putting limits on government just as there is a legal system putting limits on corporations.<br />4.  Free association.  Theoretically, you are free to leave your job with a corporation; this might force corporations to provide their employees with desirable incentives to work.  You are also free to leave most countries, including the US.  <br />5.  Size.  The largest corporation is still smaller than a country.  (I mean the real countries, not the fake places like Vatican and Andorra.)  But will this be for much longer?</p>
<p>Are there any other differences?  Does it all come down to size?</p>

<blockquote>Sen. Joseph Biden, the incoming chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, said he has invited Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to testify during three weeks of hearings in January about the Iraq war.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would be a great idea if Condoleezza Rice decided to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth (sorry to turn Perry Mason-ish on you this evening).  But we’ve seen this woman testify before.  Stonewall, beat the clock, and when that doesn’t pan out – lie through her teeth on every real question.  Now if the Biden committee follows up with perjury charges, fine.  But I have really grown tired of listening to Dr. Rice lie before such committees. And there are some who actually thinks this person deserves to be our next President????</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I was reading <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/mankiws-non-theorem-on-minimum-wage.html">PGL&#8217;s post</a> about Mankiw&#8217;s latest whatever-it-is-one-calls-that-thing-that-Mankiw-does, and I had a thought.   I&#8217;m kind of sick right now, so I don&#8217;t know if the thought only makes sense to me because I&#8217;m sick, or if there&#8217;s something to it.  </p>
<p>So&#8230; fully prepared to be very embarrassed when my mind is back at work, here&#8217;s my thought&#8230;.</p>
<p>Two of the basic inputs into production are capital and labor.  There is a price floor on labor &#8211; its the minimum wage.  But there is also a price floor on capital &#8211; its the fed funds rate.  Just as few workers work at the minimum wage, most capital gets paid more than the fed funds rate, or at least the &#8220;real&#8221; fed funds rate, which would be the fed funds rate less the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>One difference between the minimum wage and the fed funds rate is that while the latter is sometimes raised, it is also sometimes lowered.  Except that it isn&#8217;t a real difference&#8230; the real minimum wage, adjusted for inflation, is also lowered sometimes&#8230; in fact, it is usually being decreased.  Simply keeping the minimum wage constant, as it has been kept for years now, lowers the real minimum wage.  </p>
<p>Now, raising the cost of capital can decrease the amount of capital that gets used, slowing down the economy.  (It doesn&#8217;t always&#8230; sometimes even raising the price floor doesn&#8217;t bring it to the market clearing level.)  Lowering the cost of capital can increase the amount of capital that gets used (again, with the caveat above the market clearing price), which can overheat the economy.</p>
<p>So what are the differences between the real Fed Funds rate and the real minimum wage?  From what I can tell, they are these:<br />1.  The nominal wage is sticky downward, so decreases in the real minimum wage are bounded by the rate of inflation.  The real Fed Funds rate can be decreased more quickly.<br />2.  The folks who have political power in this country control capital, not labor.   Capital is more valuable, regardless of the cost of capital itself, when labor is cheap.<br />3.  I imagine Mankiw would have a conniption if anyone ever advocated a slow constant deterioration in the real fed funds rate.  </p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s about all the brain is producing right now.  So tell me what&#8217;s wrong with what I just wrote.</p>
<p>Update.  Corrected typo pointed out by Laurent GUERBY.</p>

                                <p>Once again, <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/12/working-at-cross-purposes.html">Greg Mankiw</a> tries to ridicule any economist who supports an increase in the minimum wage:<br />
<blockquote>Consider this policy aimed to help workers at the bottom of the income distribution:</p>
<p>1. A wage subsidy for unskilled workers, paid for by<br />2. A tax on employers who hire unskilled workers.</p>
<p>Now, if you think like an economist, you might wonder about the logic of part 2 of this proposal. You might say, &#8220;A tax on the hiring of unskilled workers would discourage their employment, offsetting some of the benefits they would get from the wage subsidy. It would be better to finance the wage subsidy with a more general tax, rather than with a tax targeted specifically on employers of unskilled workers.&#8221;</p>
<p>I agree. So why did I bring up this proposal? Because a policy essentially the same looks likely to become law, having been advocated by Congressional leaders and, recently at his news conference, President Bush. Haven&#8217;t heard of it? It is called an increase in the minimum wage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Mankiw is posing the following experiment in three steps but he only mentions the last two:</p>
<p>(1) Raise the minimum wage floor by Z;</p>
<p>(2) Grant an employment subsidy equal to X;</p>
<p>(3) Impose an employment tax equal to X.</p>
<p>Regardless of the size of X (in the real world experiment, X = 0 &#8211; but in Mankiw&#8217;s experiment X = Z), (2) and (3) cancel.  If Dr. Mankiw thinks this proves (1) has no effect, I suggest he rethink his experiment.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/12/poverty_rates_i.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes another consumption-based inequality argument from <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/commentary/20061223-100359-6712r.htm">Alan Reynolds</a>: <br />
<blockquote>No economist who hopes to avoid professional ridicule would try to deny that consumption is a better measure of long-term living standards than the most widely cited income distribution figures, which do not even add transfer payments or subtract taxes … Yet growth of consumption by the bottom fifth grew by 7 percent in 2000, and by another 3.1 percent in 2001. They consumed much more than their apparent money income, which is always the case … If we add figures for 2000 and 2001 to those of 2002-2005, consumption still grew a percentage point faster in the top group (2.2 percent) than the bottom (1.2 percent) and slightly faster than the middle (1.8 percent).</p></blockquote>
<p>Poor people are consuming more?  Mark provides a graph of the consumption and income definitions of poverty drawn from a recent paper by <a href="http://woodrow.mpls.frb.fed.us/pubs/fedgaz/06-11/standard.cfm">Ronald A. Wirtz</a> of the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, which shows that the consumption based definition has poverty virtually unchanged since 2000 even as the income measure shows an increase in poverty.  Wirtz provides two possible explanations of the divergent signals.  The first is the same argument that Alan Reynolds would offer:<br />
<blockquote>Some economists prefer to look at consumption because it is less volatile than income on an annual basis for most households. People smooth their consumption based on long-term income expectations. Such a phenomenon is readily apparent among those who lose a job. While their income might plummet, consumption tends to fall much less dramatically. Such households tend to either dip into savings or take on additional debt with the expectation that higher income will return in due time.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/does-income-inequality-lead-to.html">earlier</a>, Reynolds is pushing the permanent income hypothesis where consumption measures expected lifetime income.  But Wirtz later notes another possibility that we have discussed before when he quotes Austin Nichols, a research associate at the Urban Institute:<br />
<blockquote>“I disagree that consumption is a better measure of well-being,” in part because researchers don&#8217;t know how much consumption is financed by unsustainable borrowing. He added that consumption measures “have just as many problems as income-based measures.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I would not professionally ridicule Austin Nichols on this latter point.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m kind of under the weather, so this will be short&#8230;  Apparently a lot of people get engaged around Christmas.  I heard a lot of ads on the radio for diamonds lately.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m curious about is the fact that if you buy diamonds at store X, they&#8217;re guaranteed to appraise for at least Y times what you paid.  Now, if that were regularly true, and you could sell diamonds for what they&#8217;re appraised, there&#8217;s an unlimited arbitrage opportunity.  Presumably, that&#8217;s not the case.  So the appraisals are not really worth anything, except that some small part of the market is willing to pay appraised value.  </p>
<p>My girlfriend thinks its just a scheme to rip off insurance companies.  Anyone know what is going on and why?</p>

                                <p>This may sound like an odd question since Ecuador has pegged its currency such that $1 purchases <a href="http://www.ecamcham.com/ecuador/moneda_en.htm">25 thousand sucres</a>.  Actually, my intent is to follow-up <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/social-security-if-trust-fund-is.html">this post</a>: <br />
<blockquote>let’s think about how market prices respond to default risk. Oh yea, the market prices of long-term bonds would fall, which would mean that their yields would be higher.</p></blockquote>
<p>My point was that if markets expect the U.S. Federal government to default on its obligations in about 20 years, the yield on long-term Federal bonds would be higher than what we currently observe.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=akt68CjalSB0">Lester Pimentel and Helen Murphy</a> of Bloomberg report:<br />
<blockquote>Ecuador&#8217;s bonds had their biggest &#8211; ever decline after the incoming finance minister said the government may restructure its $11 billion debt in a way similar to Argentina, which defaulted on $95 billion in 2001. Ecuador&#8217;s benchmark 10 percent bonds due 2030 tumbled after Ricardo Patino said yesterday president-elect Rafael Correa&#8217;s administration will meet with bondholders next month to discuss a plan that “may be more like what happened in Argentina” &#8230; The yield on the bonds today surged 184 basis points to 13.32 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>The yield on Ecuador bonds reflects a significant probability of default.  So far – we see no such evidence as far as U.S. Federal bonds.  Alas – we haven’t seen any evidence that President Bush will spend political capital on fiscal responsibility.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This post is probably ill-advised.  But I am trying to write it in a way that hopefully nobody will take offense.  Please read it in that context. </p>
<p>To start with, let me just say that I am not a Christian – I do not believe in Jesus.  A good friend of mine, who is a devout Christian, has tried a number of times to get me to believe.  He has provided me with reading material – including CS Lewis’ Mere Christianity.  And I think he has been very surprised that I do not believe, because I have had a lot of exposure to religion in my life, and always been very interested in religious matters.  I read the Old Testament, the Testament, the Koran, the Book of Mormon, as well as part of the Book of Christian Science and Dianetics at least once before graduating from college.  I also know something of the history of each of the major Western faiths.  (In part that comes from spending one’s childhood at a Catholic school, in part from natural curiosity.)  </p>
<p>I’ll be honest, though, and note that I haven’t been paying as much attention to religious issues in the last decade – I think I’ve given up my search by concluding that there isn’t much out there.  That doesn’t mean any disrespect toward those who have concluded otherwise, but I personally just don’t see it.  But this being Christmas and all, and this being an economics blog, I want to talk a bit about believers, Jesus (these two being issues of Christmas) and motivations and constraints (these two being the building blocks of economics).  </p>
<p>My devout Christian friend has had even more exposure to religion, though on balance, his has been more limited to Christianity as practiced widely in the US.  He went to Wheaton College, in Illinois – about as religious an institution as you’ll find, and he’s read the classics.  He tells me that as far as he can tell, there is only one unforgiveable sin, which is to turn away from God when God calls you.  </p>
<p>Now this is interesting to me as it is an area that overlaps economics.  Christians feel that faith is a gift that God provides to some but not to others.  You either believe or you don’t, and presumably, one cannot make oneself believe.  (Try forcing yourself to believe, to truly believe, that the sky is Kelly green.)  That has to come either from evidence, or from somewhere.</p>
<p>Now, if there is a True Faith (whether Christianity more or less as widely practiced in the US or something else), it hasn’t relied on evidence.  Most of the Holy Books (of Western faiths at least) describes miracles – things that are clearly evidence of the supernatural if they did occur.  But how can one believe that the miracles described in one Holy Book occurred while those described in another did not?  What diferentiates between set and the other?  The evidence available is not enough to say that Holy Book A describes true miracles, while Holy Book B describes fraudulent miracles.  Thus, in the end, the differentiating factor – the reason why one person is a Jew, another a Christian of one denomination, another a Christian of second denomination, the next person a Muslim, the one after that a Mormon, and so forth, comes down to faith.  And faith is not enough to guarantee that is True Faith.  (I note that the doctrines of the major Western Religions alone are sufficiently different that I, at least, do not see how they can be compatible.)  </p>
<p>Now, let us assume (because most readers of this blog are American) that the True Faith is the American version of Christianity, and return to the one unforgivable sin.  An economist might ask &#8211; how can someone who truly believes turn away?  The benefits of doing what God asks you, if you believe in Christianity as its practiced in much of the US, are literally infinite – spending Heaven in eternity.  What about the costs?  Well, the costs of compliance may be high – God might call you to do something difficult, that causes you to lose your pride, to renounce material wealth or even family and friends.  But these are temporary, they last at most, literally, only a lifetime, which is not even a fraction of a fraction of a fraction of human history, much less of eternity.  </p>
<p>The only type of person who would do something like this has to have an infinite discount rate.  Honestly, I’m not sure such a person could be considered rational, which raises questions in my mind about punishing such a person.</p>
<p>Anyway, I’d like to throw this open to any issues of how economics ties in with religion you might have.  I’m particularly curious… for those who believe in one or another faith…  how do you reconcile faith in one religion as opposed to another religion with lack of evidence?  One request… please keep all comments civil.</p>
<p>In any case, I would like to wish all the Angry Bear readers, those who have faith and those who don’t, a Merry Christmas.  May you find happiness.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>We know this President prides himself on being an MBA president.  And he also considers himself a war president.  So presumably, he must be some sort of MBA-war president, running the war efficiently, effectively, and on the cheap.  Right?  </p>
<p>The following tables show the annual percentage change in real spending on defense per capita, the annual chagne in the defense as a share of the budget, and the annual change in defense as a percentage of GDP under various administrations going back to 1952.</p>
<p>____Real $ per Cap___Share of Budget___Pct of GDP<br />Ike______-2.49%________-1.99____________-0.49<br />JFK_____0.58%_________-1.40____________-0.13<br />LBJ_____4.86%_________-0.40____________0.12<br />Nixon___-6.91%________-2.75____________-0.67<br />Ford____-2.87%________-2.70____________-0.15<br />Carter___0.26%_________-0.35____________-0.08<br />Reagan__4.00%_________0.58_____________0.11<br />GHW___-4.49%________-1.43_____________-0.25<br />Clinton__-3.85%________-0.64_____________-0.23<br />GW_____7.05%________0.70______________0.20</p>
<p>By every measure, defense spending has increased more under GW than under any previous President since Ike took office.  And yet, previous wars (or at least spending increases) were geared toward more formidable foes – under LBJ, America was fighting a proxy war against the Soviets, and Reagan was trying to spend the USSR under the table.  Neither quite succeeded at increasing spending the way GW has increased spending.  Nor did GHW, who also led the country in a war in the same area, even though GHW mobilized a larger force.  </p>
<p>Note… real (2000 dollars) spending on defense per capita in 2005 was about $1500, which was quite a bit less than the almost $2100 per person under LBJ in 1968, or the $1823 per person in 1986 under Reagan.  Similarly, defense spending as a share of the budget and as a share of GDP have generally been declining since World War 2 ended.  Thus, just as with the debt, in absolute numbers, GW is not doing poorly, but the trend he has put in place is rather alarming.  </p>
<p>Now why did I use the word “alarming?”  Well, there are plenty of people who tell us that Social Security is in trouble, because costs are rising rapidly and revenues are not.  But we all know what GW has done to the revenues that go toward paying for defense – we saw <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist01z3.xls">3 consecutive years of decline of tax revenues </a> – something that hasn’t happened any other time for which data is available.  </p>
<p>In 2005, spending on Social Security was about equal to spending on National Defense, but the increase in real Social Security expenditures per person from 2000 to 2005 was 1.33%.  If Social Security is in trouble, what can be said about defense spending which seems to have even bigger problems on both the revenue and expenditure side?</p>
