                                <p>Steven Kyle has had a number of very good posts up recently.  Here&#8217;s another:</p>
<p>If Oil Were Priced in Euros …</p>
<p>….  would it really make much difference?  Not as much as some people seem to think. There are a series of myths out there, among them that quoting oil prices in dollars keeps the dollar oil price down, and another that it supports the value of the dollar vis a vis other currencies.  Neither of these is true.</p>
<p>&#8211;  Does quoting oil prices in dollars make a difference to the price of oil in dollars?</p>
<p> No.  The price of oil is a relative price and the dollar price of oil depends on two things – the price of oil relative to other goods in the world market and the value of the dollar.  The first is clearly not something that depends on which currency you measure value in since it depends on the actual supply and demand for oil relative to other goods.  This is whatever it is on a given day and would be the same if we divided all prices by 1.32 or whatever the current dollar/euro rate is.  </p>
<p> The real source of the fallacy is in the second part – the value of the dollar – since it might seem on the face of it that if the dollar falls then oil prices would stay the same if they were denominated in dollars.  However, this gets the causality wrong.  The relative price of oil as opposed to other goods is fundamental – the price in terms of dollars is just the result of the supply and demand translated into dollars.  To believe otherwise is to believe that every time the value of the dollar drops the real value of oil drops by the same amount.  This is simply not the case, as a look at a historical series of oil prices and the dollar will show you.  Indeed, if any anything the LESS oil we buy (and the lower the oil price) the HIGHER the dollar will be since our balance of payments is less in deficit and we are sending fewer dollars out into the global economy.</p>
<p>&#8211;  Does quoting the price of oil in dollars support the value of the dollar?</p>
<p> No.  Some seem to believe that if the price of oil is quoted in dollars then you need to actually have dollars to buy it.  This is not the case at all.  Oil exporters and oil traders have those nifty forex quote pages on their computers just like economists do and are happy to accept an equivalent amount of euros or yen for a boatload of oil.  Even if they take dollars (which, of course, they do) that is not what really counts for the value of the dollar at the end of the day.  What really matters is what denomination they choose to HOLD their wealth in.  After all, if an oil exporter accepts dollars and then converts them to euros 10 seconds later in order to hold them in that form it is the euro that ends up stronger and the dollar that gets weaker.  So what really matters to the value of the dollar is whether the central banks of oil exporters like to have a portfolio heavy in dollar assets or heavy in other currencies.  If the latter (as is beginning to seem to be the case – See for example, numerous posts on  Brad Setser’s blog  <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser">here</a>)  then the dollar will weaken even if the oil exporters are getting bucket loads of dollars from the US or other oil importers who would rather spend them than hold them.</p>
<p> So what is left?  There may still be some transactions demand for dollars on the part of countries that don’t have hard currencies and need to buy some to engage in international trade.  But that is a function of the ease and liquidity of the dollar market – a result of the dollar being the world reserve currency, not the numeraire for oil prices.  And that is what is really at stake here – If we run our country in a way that pumps two billion new dollars A DAY into the international market then we are going to see a tendency for the dollar to decline if/when the various foreigners who are propping it up lose their appetite for yet more of our paper.   And if one of the causes of that huge outflow of dollars is our huge appetite for oil then count on the price of oil going up in dollars as well as euros and yen while the value of the dollar goes down.  </p>
<p> But that is because of plain old supply and demand and we can “blame” the Chinese and Indians as much as ourselves – It won’t be because of some numeraire or exchange rate effect.  And we could well see the dollar replaced as the world reserve currency at some point in the future, which would have an effect on not just the world oil market, but everything we buy and sell from other countries – but that is a story for another day.</p>

<blockquote>First it was spinach. Then tomatoes. Now possibly green onions. Over the past three months, fresh produce has been the culprit in one episode of food-borne illness after another, the latest an E. coli outbreak that appears to be linked to green onions served at Taco Bell restaurants in the Northeast. More than 60 people have been sickened in that outbreak. The patchwork of federal and state regulations that is supposed to ensure food safety has become less effective as the nation&#8217;s produce supply has grown increasingly industrial. Three months after the spinach scare, there is no agreement on what should be done to reduce health risks from the nation&#8217;s fruits and vegetables even as each episode of illness has heightened a sense of urgency … The FDA&#8217;s critics say the agency doesn&#8217;t have the manpower to do more. From 2003 to 2006, the budget for the agency&#8217;s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition has fallen 37 percent, according to agency data. That has meant fewer inspectors and less frequent inspections. In 2005, the FDA conducted 4,573 inspections of domestic food-processing operations. For 2006, the agency said, it hopes to conduct 3,400. There are more than 12,000 such plants in the nation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Look, I’m in favor of cutting wasteful government spending but then President Bush says we should spend on our priorities.  I guess healthy food is not one of them.  An FDA top dog was on CNN explaining this by saying we are in austere times.  Huh?  I thought the Bush crowd was talking about this being the best economy ever.  But maybe another <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/09/AR2006120900443.html">Washington Post</a> story explains this comment:<br />
<blockquote>Steady condemnation from conservatives for the Iraq Study Group report may be providing some cover to the Bush administration as it completes its own review of strategy in Iraq, apparently with little enthusiasm for the panel&#8217;s prescription of U.S. troop withdrawal and dialogue with Syria and Iran. The criticism of the panel, co-chaired by former secretary of state James A. Baker III and former representative Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.), has burst forth from the leading institutions of the right: the National Review, the Wall Street Journal editorial page and the Weekly Standard; conservative talk radio; and scholars at some of Washington&#8217;s top think tanks.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem the neocon stay the course crowd are urging President Bush to ignore the Baker-Hamilton recommendations, which will mean continuation of this very expensive failed venture.  And the number of deaths from E.coli will pale in comparison to the loss of lives from this neocon nightmare.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader Don Marek points us to <a href="http://townhall.com/columnists/JohnStossel/2006/11/01/birdwatching,_government_style">John Stossel</a> as he criticizes how the FDA operates:<br />
<blockquote>Here&#8217;s a job that&#8217;s really for the birds: staring at dead chickens.  The job is tedious, done in unpleasant places, and largely useless. But you and I pay thousands of people to do it … So if staring at dead chickens is your idea of a good time, there is a job for you with the USDA, inspecting poultry. And don&#8217;t worry that you&#8217;ll lose the job because it doesn&#8217;t do much good &#8211; how often does that cause the government to close a program? I learned about these dead-bird watchers when a union, Government Workers Local 2357, persuaded &#8220;20/20&#8221; go into poultry-processing plants with hidden cameras to document their claim that conditions in the plants are deplorable and that chickens are contaminated with bacteria. Inside the plants, with bird intestines strung all over the place, it was easy to see why the chickens we buy are often crawling with germs. In fact, we had a lab perform tests, and they found four kinds of bacteria: yersinia, salmonella, listeria and campylobacter. Food-borne bacteria can be deadly; it kills hundreds, if not thousands, of Americans every year. Hundreds of thousands of people get sick from it. Many of you who thought you had the stomach flu this year really had food poisoning from bacteria. We should treat raw chicken as if it were covered in fecal matter &#8211; it&#8217;s crawling with bacteria. Keep it away from the salad, and wash the cutting board. Local 2357 had a different solution: The government must hire more union inspectors. Apparently if more people stared at the birds, they&#8217;d be better at seeing invisible germs &#8230; The chicken industry likes things the way they are because it gets free employees. They have taxpayer-paid inspectors to make sure all the birds look good; the inspectors even stamp the bacteria-laden birds with a government label that promises they&#8217;re wholesome. Microbial testing of random samples would be cheaper. And scientists told us the best protection would be to treat poultry with cobalt irradiation, which kills virtually all disease-causing organisms and doesn&#8217;t require paying government inspectors to watch dead birds go by.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what is Mr. Stossel telling us?  That there’s a better way to run the FDA program?  If so, let’s push for the new and improved form of FDA regulation.  Or is Mr. Stossel advocating the self policing system that Don Marek prefers?  If so, I have a question for the laissez-faire crowd – why isn’t the industry doing this on its own accord?</p>

                                <p>Cactus has started an interesting tradition – letting those who have different points of view than the ones often presented at Angrybear go beyond putting their views in the comment box and allowing a few to become guest posts.  AB reader <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/in-defense-of-social-security.html">M. Jed</a>, for example, argues for Social Security privatization:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me state up front that I am a proponent of Social Security privatization. My reasons vary, and in researching this, some were validated and others called into question but they included – (1) higher expected rates of return, (2) increased equity ownership and portfolio diversification for those at the lower end of wealth spectrum, and (3) a personal bias towards increased individual responsibility versus social responsibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m tempted to point out that <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006321">Gary Becker</a> and <a href="http://post.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/barro/bw/bw00_07_03.pdf">Robert Barro</a> might agree with (3) but they have also argued that (1) and (2) are false.  I have tried to make the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/privatization-brad-plumer-joins-no.html">same point</a> numerous times. M. Jed actually makes this easy as he points us to <a href="http://www.bc.edu/centers/crr/papers/wp_2005-11.pdf">Top Ten Myths of Social Security Reform</a> by Jeffrey Brown, Kevin Hassett, and Kent Smetters:</p>
<blockquote><p>Myth 4 &#8230; This mathematic and economic reality has not stopped some proponents of personal accounts from arguing that there is a “free lunch” available, if only we would divert existing tax revenue into personal accounts. The idea behind this approach is that the higher rates of return that would be achieved by investing Social Security funds in the stock market (or other private investments) would allow us to deliver future benefits that are greater than or equal to the existing level of scheduled benefits without raising taxes … The only problem with this approach is a simple one – it is not true … The fallacy of this argument, which is nearly universally understood by academic economists of all political stripes, has been known for decades and is perhaps most clearly explained in work by Geanakoplos, Mitchell, and Zeldes … “Myth 5” below will address this issue more in-depth, but a problem with simple rate of return comparisons is that these analyses often fail to acknowledge that higher rates of return on stocks are simply the market’s compensation for risk.</p>
<p>Myth 5 &#8230; A leading selling point among advocates of personal accounts is that the rate of return that individuals can achieve through personal accounts is much greater than the return that is available through the existing Social Security system &#8230; It is certainly true that an individual (or, for that matter, a centralized fund) can earn an expected rate of return on private investments that is higher than the internal rate of return that the average worker can expect to receive from Social Security. It does not follow, however, that redirecting existing Social Security payroll tax revenue into private investments will necessarily increase the rate of return for participants. There are two basic reasons that this is so. First, when using existing Social Security revenue to finance the private investment, it is necessary to net out the expense of servicing the legacy costs of the system. As already discussed under Myth 4, unless policymakers decide that they will not honor the benefit obligations to current and future retirees, we still need to find the funds to pay those benefits. An accurate comparison of rates of return from Social Security contributions should account for these costs in both the current system and in a mixed system where part of the funds are redirected to personal accounts.  A second issue is that statements about higher rates of return need to be accompanied by appropriate caveats about risk. Basic finance theory teaches that higher expected returns are the reward for bearing increased risk. For example, stocks have a higher expected return than bonds because stocks are riskier than bonds, i.e., stocks will outperform bonds on average, but also carry with them an increased probability of “extreme” outcomes (e.g., experiencing very high, or very low, even negative, returns). This must be true in a market equilibrium as long as investors like high returns and dislike risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – the privatization crowd loves to lecture us that stocks pay a higher expected return than bonds, but then the same households they would transfer the Social Security Trust Fund bonds too likely know this as they also recognize the risks from holding bonds.  Now perhaps M. Jed thinks these households are irrationally risk averse, while Barro and Becker would view their risk aversion as rational.  But it makes no difference as to who is correct as these households would take these bonds and invest them in guess what – government bonds.  Which means there would be no change in either risk taking or expected returns.  I’m truly amazed how many times we hear this free lunch argument given the simple financial economists put forth by Gary Becker, Robert Barro, and many others – which appeared in that 1998 paper by Geanakoplos, Mitchell, and Zeldes.</p>

                                <p>Thankfully, the Hastert led Congress will not be in power after this year so that it cannot do more of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/08/congress.roundup.ap/index.html">this</a>: <br />
<blockquote>In its last hours of GOP control, Congress passed a raft of bills big and small, most significantly a sweeping bill reviving expired tax breaks, extending trade benefits for developing countries and protecting doctors from a big cut in Medicare payments.</p></blockquote>
<p>The CNN headline says Congress finished with a flourish.  Pretending to cut taxes as Congress insures its increases in entitlement will be large.  Pathetic or just for the course?  There may be a few fiscal conservatives in the Congress but the story notes:<br />
<blockquote>The legislation was bundled and sent to the Senate for a single vote, and its popularity easily vanquished a handful of GOP opponents. Republican budget hawks bridled at the measure&#8217;s cost, and textile state senators objected to trade provisions benefiting Haiti. The sweeping votes reflected widespread bipartisan support for extending expired tax breaks, including the research and development tax credit for businesses, sales tax deductions for people in states without income taxes, the tax deduction on college tuition, a tax credit for hiring welfare recipients and others facing difficulties finding jobs, tax credits for alternative energy producers and purchases of solar energy equipment by homeowners and businesses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, free lunch fiscal policy is popular and there aren’t enough leaders in the Democratic Party who are willing to say no.  I hope this changes when Nancy Pelosi becomes the Speaker because I see this as an opportunity:<br />
<blockquote>But Republicans dumped an unfinished budget on the Democrats about to take power, with the Senate barely meeting a midnight deadline to pass a stopgap spending bill putting the government on autopilot until February 15. The failure to pass budget bills for domestic agencies, said Rep. David Obey, D-Wisconsin, amounted to &#8220;a blatant admission of abject failure by the most useless Congress in modern times.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Irresponsible?  Yes.  But now that the Democrats are about to gain control of Congress, my hope is that Speaker Pelosi sits down with the true fiscal conservatives in the GOP and the Blue Dog Democrats to figure out where some of the pork can be sliced out of these bills.</p>

                                <p>This one is by reader M. Jed.  You might remember that last month, M. Jed had a post on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/m-jeds-post-on-demographics-and-tax.html">how demographics affect tax collections</a>.  Here&#8217;s M. Jed:</p>
<p>Let me state up front that I am a proponent of Social Security privatization.  My reasons vary, and in researching this, some were validated and others called into question but they included – (1) higher expected rates of return, (2) increased equity ownership and portfolio diversification for those at the lower end of wealth spectrum, and (3) a personal bias towards increased individual responsibility versus social responsibility.  Solvency is not and has never been one of my reasons.  Frequent commenter Bruce Webb, persistently asks privatization proponents to backup their ideology with numbers and what follows is my attempt.  </p>
<p>For those, including myself, that recognize Social Security as a combination of retirement savings and disability insurance, fortunately the SS Administration breaks out the components of the contribution rates.  The Old Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) (original design of the program) component of the contribution rate is <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/t2a3.pdf">5.3% for each employee and employer.</a>  Using the <a href="http://pubdb3.census.gov/macro/032006/hhinc/new02_001.htm">Consumer Population Survey’s Income Statistics</a>, I recreated a life-cycle household earnings chronology, for the median household, which based on my estimates starts at $30,000 at age 22 (median for 15-24 year olds is $28,770) and peaks at $64,000 at age 45, before starting to decline again. The real IRR of SS for the post baby-boom generation is estimated at<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v62n2/v62n2p43.pdf"> about 1.8%.</a>  With the contribution rate, estimated household incomes, and the IRR, it’s possible to estimate the projected real account value at retirement (I used age 65).  For this hypothetical median family, they contribute $247,000 over the course of their career(s) and have a real account value at retirement of $370,000.  As I understand the cited source, the 1.8% real IRR only incorporates the OASI component of SS so it is apples-to-apples for the 10.6% employer/employee combined contribution.  </p>
<p>Now, most people (even Bruce) acknowledge if one were to have instead invested prior contributions and received the historical equity rates of return, the Social Security account values would be substantially higher.   What Bruce doggedly questions is why people assume that historical equity returns are likely to persist in an environment where the required assumption (i.e., that SS faces problems) is that productivity growth will be lower than history.  I make no such assumption, however, in researching this post I found that the primary reason OASI has a lower IRR than government bonds is because of the net wealth transfer that benefited initial recipients in a pay-as-you-go pension scheme, since they made no contributions.  This wealth transfer needs to be taken into account when projecting rates of return and is estimated as a reduction of 25% of contributions.  Note that grossing up the 1.8% IRR for this 25% reduction, is 2.4%, or about the historical real return on government bonds, and slightly better than current long-dated TIPS yields.  </p>
<p>So let’s move to equities.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/"> There </a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">exist</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/"></a>>multiple <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">sources</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">that</a> note that historical rates of return on equities are not the correct benchmark, but rather they seem to center on an expected forward real U.S. equity return of<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/"> 4.5%.</a>  I’ve been unable to find projections for foreign equities, but I recognize arguments for either greater or lesser expected returns relative to U.S. markets and also the political firestorm that recommending investing Social Security contributions in non-U.S. based companies would create and thereby default to the 4.5% for the entire equities component.  Using a real rate of equity returns of 4.5%, an assumption of an administration fee on equities of 0.25%, and a 25% reduction in the rate to pay for historical wealth transfer produces an effective expected total return on equities of 3.2%.  If one were to allocate 50/50, the effective expected SS rate would be 2.5% compared to today’s 1.8%.  Over the course of a median career, this results in an expected portfolio at retirement that is 22% higher than the status quo and if one were to allocate 75% to equities it would be 33% higher.  </p>
<p>The post-retirement OASI annuity component must also be taken into account, but I’d note that there currently exist a plethora of private products with income-for-life for both the purchaser and spouse that have both market exposure and guaranteed returns.  Analyzing these would necessitate a much longer post.</p>
<p>In conclusion, (1) private accounts would produce higher expected at-retirement account values, though nowhere near as high as most proponents suggest and (2) the “free lunch” comes from increased diversification for those who have traditionally not invested in equities, which I personally assume is because most of their savings has gone to Social Security.  Finally, by far the best and most balanced summary of SS issues I found was <a href="http://www.bc.edu/crr/papers/wp_2005-11.pdf"> here</a> which addresses the top 10 myths of SS reform perpetuated by both the left and the right, many of which have been discussed at AngryBear.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve stated my views of the two main political parties before&#8230; its my opinion that at this point in time (at least since 1994, if not 1980), the Democrats are less obnoxious than the Republicans.  I&#8217;m hopeful the Democrats are going to clean up Washington, but I&#8217;m not exactly willing to bet on it.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_12/010363.php">Kevin Drum </a> links to an article providing some indication that the incoming Democrats are as willing to embrace complete ignorance on important subjects, and elevate the completely ignorant to leadership positions, as the outgoing Republicans.  </p>
<p>You can&#8217;t win a war if you don&#8217;t have a clue who you&#8217;re fighting, and you can&#8217;t win it if you aren&#8217;t fighting the people who are fighting you.</p>
<p>Let me close this post by stating&#8230; the hell with all these people who don&#8217;t have the decency to step aside when their ignorance costs lives.  I hope they rot.  And I hope the same for those who enable them.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This one is by Steven Kyle:</p>
<p>It was reported yesterday (See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/08/world/africa/08worldbank.html">here</a>) that the World Bank’s work in rural Africa has not yielded good results.  This is a bit misleading – Though I wouldn’t want to disagree with this statement, it would be more accurate to say that the World Bank hasn’t generated much in the way of results in rural Africa because the World Bank has retreated from any major effort to achieve those results in recent years.  </p>
<p>A quick look at the Bank’s own website reveals that out of 251 loans and credits to date in 2006 only 24 were for the purpose of Agriculture and Rural Development.  Of these 24 only 11 were for countries in Sub Saharan Africa.  Even granting that this figure only represents projects initiated in 2006 it is still obvious that rural development is not a primary focus of World Bank lending.  Rather, as stated in the article, emphasis has been more on education and combating corruption.</p>
<p>These are certainly worthy goals – but the Bank’s retreat from agriculture over the past decade or so is the result of several different forces – one is the dismal performance of many rural development efforts in the past but another is simply the fact that rural development is difficult and time-consuming so that even if there are positive results they aren’t seen within the 5-7 year span of most projects. Another factor which is not so fashionable to point out is that there are quite a few Sub Saharan African countries where growth in agriculture is never going to be all that great because the countries involved are located in deserts where it seldom rains and soils are poor.  Yet another is the fact that agricultural development, unlike some other activities with more of a public good nature, is not best done by bureaucrats in capital cities.  (Just look at the disaster the centrally planned economies made of agriculture – The World Bank is not alone in this problem)</p>
<p>The World Bank is as prone to fads and cycles as any other organization.  The problem with relegating rural development to a second tier status is that in many parts of the world that’s where most of the poor people are.  Depending on whether you believe the World Bank is a useful participant in trying to promote rural development, we should hope that agriculture will be the target of renewed interest in the future.</p>

                                <p>In the comments to Steve Kyle&#8217;s post on the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/economic-literacy-of-teenagers-by.html">economic literacy of college students</a>, Tom DC/VA mentions a hypothetical economic literacy course for high school students.</p>
<p>What would such a class entail?  If you read this blog, you shouldn&#8217;t be surprised I think it should make students familiar with the magnitude of numbers.  Of course, nobody can visualize a 12 trillion dollar GDP &#8211; they can, however, visualize real GDP per capita.  Same with debt, etc.  </p>
<p>Another thing&#8230;  students have to be taught empathy, and I don&#8217;t mean it in the bleeding heart liberal sense.  Consider&#8230; I taught for a while at an MBA program whose students are often quite wealthy.  (One professor has joked that the school has the GDP of Austria.)  I found many concepts were alien to them.  For instance, nobody could understand discouraged workers &#8211; why would people voluntarilly choose to be unemployed?  So I had an exercise&#8230; I would pick a small town in the middle of nowhere.  We would talk about life in the town &#8211; how it has only one big employer, perhaps a saw mill or whatnot.   I would then ask &#8211; what happens if that saw mill closes?</p>
<p>Well, the response was&#8230; &#8220;find another job.&#8221;  Ah&#8230; but you and 200 other people are searching&#8230;  what other job?  <br />The next response was &#8220;Leave. Move to Chicago or whatever happens to be the nearest big city.&#8221;  But&#8230;  how much can you get for your four bedroom home in the small town, especially now that the saw mill closed down?  And how much is a home in Chicago?  You, your spouse, and your three kids have to live somewhere.  And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>I think teaching kids to put themselves into other people&#8217;s shoes and think things through to their logical conclusion has a lot of value.</p>
<p>What about you?  What do you think should be in the course that Tom DC/VA mentions?</p>

                                <p>In comments to PGL&#8217;s post, <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/116563664342477890/#574360">Greg Mankiw writes</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I were auditioning for the National Review, do you think I would be using my blog to advocate an increase in gasoline taxes?&#8221;</p>
<p>Some of you may remember my post on Arnold Harberger a few weeks back.  Now, I was reminded of Harberger again when I read Mankiw&#8217;s comment.  If it wasn&#8217;t clear from my previous post, I think Harberger is brilliant.  He simplifies amazingly well, cutting right down to the bone but no farther.  Its milimetric precision, and he does it very quickly.  But one thing that is clear to anyone who knows who Harberger is &#8211; nobody sane, not even a Pinochet, would ever confuse him with a liberal.</p>
<p>And yet&#8230; unless I&#8217;m hallucinating, I remember Harberger saying in class that the thought there should be a large tax on gasoline.  I think he specifically mentioned an additional $3 per gallon.  In fact, I remember arguing with him about it both during and after class.  For context, this would have been about 1992 or 1993.  And I remember having the same discussion with him in his office a couple of years later &#8211; probably around 1995. </p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not about to say that a tax on gasoline is a popular position among conservatives, or even among conservatives who know their economics.  But, here is an example of two economists, both of whom are at least very, very good (even if I personally think one made the decision to become a hack &#8211; and I&#8217;m not talking about Harberger) who support a specific tax.  And it is a tax that many liberals might not support.  I personally would support a higher tax on gasoline&#8230; $3 a gallon (in 1993 dollars) higher, well, I&#8217;m not sure.  I&#8217;ve never run any numbers.   </p>
<p>So what gives?</p>

<p>What motivated <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/12/wage-growth.html">Greg Mankiw</a> to write this comment:<br />
<blockquote>The average hourly wage for workers below management level &#8211; everyone from school bus drivers to stockbrokers &#8211; rose 2.8 percent from October 2005 to October of this year, after being adjusted for inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, Greg is quoting a NYTimes that we discussed <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/november-employment-report.html">this morning</a> and yes it is technically true &#8211; if one does not consider the latest news from the BLS that nominal wage growth was only 2% on an annualized basis last month.  We’ll have to wait to see how much the CPI rose.  If real wages dip even by the slightest amount, then real wage growth from November 2003 to November 2006 will have been ZERO.  Not exactly commensurate with the real wage growth during the 1997 to 2001 period.  This is rather obvious to anyone who understands the facts – and I’m sure that Greg Mankiw does as well as anyone.  So why does he continue to write Karl Rove approved spin?  I hope Harvard is compensating him enough that he does not need income from the National Review crowd.</p>
