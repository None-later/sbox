<p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MTQ5MWZhMzVkYzc5MzBiYzM1YzlmZGI0MmJkZjE5NzY">Thomas Nugent</a> thinks that us silly economists should take Accounting 101:<br />
<blockquote>Accountants, as a matter of practice, also must use two hands, although their margin for error is much smaller. Whereas economic foreasts can be either close to or wide of the mark, accountants are held to strict standards of accuracy. As a result, professional accounting relies on the balance sheet &#8211; the key to making sure that one and one make two. Balance sheets are important tools for evaluating the events or cash flows that affect corporate finances.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well golly gee, this is news to me – NOT.  So what is Mr. Nugent really trying to say here:<br />
<blockquote>For instance, when a government spends money on an aircraft carrier, an asset (the aircraft carrier) is created. Over time, government spending will create an enormous trove of assets &#8211; buildings, national parks, defense systems, etc. &#8211; that can continue to exist for many years and better the lifestyles of our children and grandchildren. But there’s a hitch: the politician who has little, if any, economic or accounting knowledge. There are many such politicians running around Washington, D.C., people who forget or ignore assets when evaluating the impact of budget deficits on the economy. Indeed, the boogeyman strategy of scaring the American public about how deficit spending is eroding the future for our children ignores all of the assets that have been built with increased government spending and, when necessary, borrowing. Such assets add to our future well being. To say that deficit spending simply detracts from our potential is like a homeowner viewing the liability of his mortgage without considering the asset value of his home.  Politicians veer down this wrong path when they ignore the two-handed impact of such deficits. For example, when an American buys a Toyota, he exchanges one asset with his Japanese counterpart, who in turn gets the equivalent of an I.O.U. for future purchases of U.S. goods and services. And when the counterparty decides to convert future goods into current goods, the transaction will create job demand and increase economic activity here at home. Liabilities? These deficits are valuable. There is a timing element to all this. Current trade deficits create future economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, so when President Bush is racking up enormous amounts of new Federal liabilities, these are backed by all sorts of new income-producing assets.  And that current account deficit is nothing more than a surge in investment demand as the national savings rate is still high.  The problem with the latter argument is that our national savings rate is near zero, while the ratio of gross private domestic investment to GDP actually lower now (16.9%) than it was in 2000 (17.7%). </p>
<p>But what about Mr. Nugent’s claim that our government is investing more in the future?  Our first graph shows the ratio of government investment to GDP from 1993 to 2006 as measured by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  In 2006, this ratio is about 3.2% &#8211; which seems to be the average over the past 14 years.  If all this is borrowing is being done to accumulate assets, one would expect a surge in either private or government investment.  But we don’t see that.  </p>
<p>Our second graph plots household net worth as a share of GDP and the Federal debt as a share of GDP (accounting tip for Mr. Nugent – net worth is defined as asset minus liabilities).  There has been a recent increase in the latter ratio, but Mr. Nugent says don’t worry about that as we are creating other assets.  But are we?  The net worth to GDP rose was 4.5 in late 1999 and then fell in part because market valuations of corporate equity fell.  Much of this stock market decline has reversed itself, which appears to be the only reason why the household net worth went from 3.7 in 2002 to around 4.1 now.  But the premise that we have much more in assets to compensate for that extra debt is inconsistent with the data. As <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/12/21/news/economy/savings_rate/index.htm?cnn=yes">this recent story notes</a>: <br />
<blockquote>For the last 19 months, the report has shown a negative savings rate. That means American consumers are spending more than they&#8217;re taking home after taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, business savings may be positive but with household and government savings both being negative – we are saddled with a low national savings rate.<br />Mr. Nugent is wrong – we economists do understand basic accounting.  Alas, he does not know how to read the GDP accounts or the financial data from the Flow of Funds accounts provided by the Federal Reserve.   Then again – Nugent writes for the National Review so proficiency with the data and basic integrity are not assets: they are career limiting moves.</p>
<p>But before we nominate Mr. Nugent to the stupidest man alive contest, we should read <a href="http://users1.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users1&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB116667027467856406.html%3Fmod%3Dopinion_main_commentaries">David Malpass</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Though widely criticized as an imbalance, the trade deficit and related capital inflow reflect U.S. growth, not weakness &#8211; they link the younger, faster-growing U.S. with aging, slower-growing economies abroad.  The trade deficit is the mechanism allowing consumption and investment in the U.S. to grow faster than in Europe and Japan.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/170003">Brad Setser</a> decides to get compassionate:<br />
<blockquote>Rigth now, businesses are saving more than they invest, and so they are on net contributing to the United States national savings.  That is one of the unusual features of the current situation.   The US savings shortfall comes from the fact that the US government still spends more than it takes in, even if the gap today is a bit smaller than it was in 2004.  Above all, though, the gap stems from households that don’t save any of their current income.  That means household sector that has to borrow to finance its investment in residential real estate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad S. continues to dissect the spin from Malpass.  In the meantime, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/12/why_oh_why_cant_7.html">Brad DeLong</a> is less compassionate:<br />
<blockquote>Reporters for the news side of the Wall Street Journal firmly believe that readers make a sharp distinction between WSJ news and editorial pages, and that their good and reality-based work doesn&#8217;t add credibility to the misinformation on the editorial page. I think that they are deceiving themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was wondering why Brad did not nominate Malpass for the stupidest man alive contest.  Is the slate just that overloaded or is this a clear case of WSJ oped mendacity rather than stupidity?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I thought a bit about the recent Krugman controversy, and here’s my opinion, for what its worth…</p>
<p>I have a lot of respect for Krugman, but his column has me worried about whether he will become Mankiw.  The public doesn&#8217;t buy and won&#8217;t buy the idea that large deficits can be run forever without consequences.  There might be enough gullible people out there to believe (twice) that at roughly current tax rates, a rate ct cut will reduce the deficit, but one way or the other, free lunch or not, people prefer small or no deficits to large ones.  Recall &#8211; GW&#8217;s &#8220;economic blueprint&#8221; &#8211; however ludicrous &#8211; was sold as a way to boost the economy and pay down the debt right from the start.  Section 1 was entitled <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">&#8220;Pay Down the Debt</a>.</p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t see how you sell the public on the idea, as stated by Krugman, that we have to run deficits or the other guy will spend the money later, even if its true that the other guy will spend the money later, and in worse ways.</p>
<p>Once you start the policy of running these deficits forever, regardless of your reason for doing so, you have to sell it.  The sales pitch is basically that running big deficits is not a bad thing because you’re spending it in ways that produce larger returns than they cost.  But if the deficit is large enough, and the government is spending on enough things, that is unlikely to be true – there are decreasing returns to everything, including, obviously, government spending.  </p>
<p>I’ll take the Krugman’s column as a discussion of strategy tinged with frustration.  I can accept that depending on where money is spent, we are not yet at the point where decreasing returns to scale sets in.  I’ve written about the need for more infrastructure before.  I’m willing to accept, provisionally, that if done right, the economy will grow faster with universal healthcare.  </p>
<p>But I also remember this &#8211; Mankiw was right, to some extent, too  – at some point, tax rates are high enough that cutting them will boost the economy.  No reasonable or honest person would say otherwise.  However, at some lower tax rate, that ceases to be true – a tax cut will result in a marginally worse performing economy.  Reasonable, honest people can debate where that point happens to be.  One might say X, the other Y, and those may even be wide apart.  But if tax rates drop even further, there comes a point where no honest or reasonable person would conclude that a tax cut will be on net, a benefit.</p>
<p>And there is the difference that I personally think still exists between Krugman and Mankiw.  I think there are many reasons to look out onto the abyss, as Krugman is now doing.  But if Krugman comes back from the abyss as the Democrat’s Mankiw, it will be a very bad thing, and it will be a worse one if Democrats treat their Mankiw with the deference Republicans have given the good doctor.</p>

                                <p>When I was sort of critical of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/krugmans-fiscal-advice-to-democrats.html">Krugman’s Fiscal Advice to the Democrats</a>, I should have referred to <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0002-8282(199112)81:5%3C1170:WASD%3E2.0.CO;2-V">Why are Stabilizations Delayed?</a> by Alberto Alesina and Allan Drazen – which eloquently lays out the game of chicken that concerns me.   So I owe one to <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/12/krugman-on-deficit.html">Greg Mankiw</a> who writes:<br />
<blockquote>If Paul and his conservative counterparts get their way, then at least for now we won&#8217;t see a grand bargain between the parties of the sort I described in this WSJ op-ed earlier in the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Mankiw was correct up to a point to write:<br />
<blockquote>To understand the challenge that Mr. Paulson faces, let&#8217;s start with a fact about which every serious policy analyst agrees: The government budget is on an unsustainable path. Americans are living longer and having fewer children.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are living longer and having few children are bad things?  Good grief.  Dr. Mankiw is correct that fiscal policy is an unsustainable path.  Why – because the Administration that Dr. Mankiw worked for was not honest about the needed revenues to cover all those free lunch promises from pandering politicians such as George W. Bush.  </p>
<p>Look – I agree with the spirit of Dr. Mankiw’s criticism of the “grand bargain” aka fiscal insanity.  But he is more guilty of being one of the “counterparts” than Paul Krugman ever was.  Could we stop jockeying for advantage in his game of chicken and just level with folks about the fiscal insanity of the game of chicken that began with those fake 2001 tax “cuts”?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/12/republicans_and.html">Mark Thoma</a> finds more conservative counterparts by directing us to the latest from <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-op-chait24dec24,0,6440106.column?coll=la-news-comment-opinions">Jonathan Chait</a>:  <br />
<blockquote>News reports are suggesting that Bush plans to send more troops to Iraq. Neoconservatives have been urging this very course of action for a long time. Indeed, they&#8217;ve been advocating more troops in general for years — even before the war started. And that&#8217;s not surprising. If you believe in expanding the worldwide application of American power, you need a military to do it. If you read old issues of the Weekly Standard, which is the bulletin board of neoconservatism, you can find calls for a bigger military going back to the Clinton administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Bush should have known that defense spending would have to rise even as he pushed for the 2001 tax cut.  Spend and borrow – the Republican way.</p>

<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/motivations-and-constraints-irs.html">Cactus</a> discusses the latest from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/business/21tax.html?ex=1324357200&#038;en=2f6f11bb413a1a7d&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">David Cay Johnston</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Internal Revenue Service has cut deeply the time that it spends auditing the nation’s largest corporations, according to data made public yesterday. The figures, obtained by Syracuse University researchers, showed that the I.R.S. had reduced the time spent on each audit by 21 percent in the last five years, to 958 hours from 1,210 hours. At the same time, the number of actual audits, which had increased in the last two years, has fallen back to the level of 2002.  The Syracuse researchers said the data raised questions about statements by Mark W. Everson, the I.R.S. commissioner, that he had increased enforcement of the tax laws in the last three years. I.R.S. officials said, however, that while the hours devoted to each audit had fallen, the number of additional tax dollars recommended per hour of audit had more than doubled from 2002 to 2006, to $6,500 an hour.  The government data is based on fiscal years, which end Sept. 30.  That increase “shows that we are working smarter, we are working more efficiently, we are working more effectively under a tight budget,” an I.R.S. spokesman, Terry L. Lemons, said. David Burnham, a director of the university’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, said the higher hourly figure might indicate more effective enforcement, but he proposed another explanation. “They may just be picking a lot of low-hanging fruit,” Mr. Burnham said.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would also suspect there is a low-hanging fruit that never gets picked up.  Johnston’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perfectly-Legal-Campaign-Benefit-Everybody/dp/1591840198">Perfectly Legal</a> put forth the proposition that the nation’s largest corporations were generally out-manning and out-gunning the professional staff at the IRS.  </p>
<p>Some critics of the IRS note that many multinational corporations pay less than 20% of their worldwide income in the form of Federal taxes.  This statistic itself, however, may be very misleading.  Take for example the case of Heinz which drew some stupid jokes about outsourcing from the rightwing at the expense of John Kerry and his wife.  You see – Heinz locally produces for local consumption with most of their customers being abroad.  It is also not surprising that Heinz pays a lot of taxes abroad – generally in high-tax jurisdictions.  For its last fiscal year, the effective tax rate for Heinz was 36%.  But notice something about U.S. corporations in general over the past several years.  Income taxes as a share of corporate profits have declined from approximately 35% to around 26%.  Could it be that multinationals are shifting income to low-tax jurisdictions by gaming the transfer pricing regulations under section 482?  </p>
<p>As we’ve noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/big-pharma-and-shifting-profits-to.html">before</a>, chapter 18 of Perfectly Legal is entitled “Letters to Switzerland”, where Johnston illustrates transfer pricing manipulation using an example of a pharmaceutical company transferring U.S. created intangibles to Switzerland for an amount below market value.  But the IRS might argue they had a huge success in terms of the Glaxo litigation.  While this is true, we are talking about a foreign based company with a U.S. distribution subsidiary.  The IRS’s point in that case appears to be that the heavy promotional expenses observed in this industry matter to transfer pricing.</p>
<p>Our link gives a hat tip to Martin A. Sullivan who writes for some very good articles for Tax Analyst with his August 2006 piece being devoted to the pharmaceutical sector. Sullivan argues that U.S. based pharmaceutical companies are setting up distribution subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions such as Switzerland and allowing them to capture the return to these heavy promotional expenses.</p>
<p>So I was curious about how the three largest pharmaceutical companies were doing in terms of their effective tax rates.  Our table takes average annual income before taxes for the three most recent years and average annual income taxes to calculate the company’s effective tax rates ($ figures in millions).  For good measure, we have also thrown in the largest biotech company.  It seems these four companies have achieved rather low effective tax rates.</p>

<blockquote>any vision of how to get jobs for Iraqis or a government that can accomplish anything is absolutely and critically dependent on the health of Iraq&#8217;s oil sector.</p></blockquote>
<p>In an earlier post, <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/12/blogging_colloq.html">Dr. Hamilton</a> discusses the importance of insuring a stable flow of oil production for the wellbeing of the average Iraqi – which he notes was part of what the Iraq Study Group discussed.  I applaud these recommendations from the Iraq Study Group.  Regardless of how the property rights for Iraqi oil are allocated, the owners of this oil will wish to sell their oil on world markets, which is what I meant by:<br />
<blockquote>Access to oil simply means one buys the stuff.</p></blockquote>
<p>The concern I expressed and that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/access-to-oil-view-from-another-civil.html">Steven Kyle</a> and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/12/what_about_iraq.html">Mark Thoma</a> expanded upon had less to do with whether oil would come back on line but rather who owns the property rights.  I would hope no American President would use war to extract property rights to resources owned by other nations and I certainly am not saying this is why George W. Bush made what I have called that stupid decision on March 19, 2003.  To use military might to expropriate resources from other nations strikes me as immoral.  But I have to say there are certain neoconservatives who disagree with me on this one.</p>

                                <p>One of the benefits of being a Bush supporter/admirer/cheerleader has been the opportunity to be an armchair general.  Making pronouncements like &#8220;let&#8217;s invade Iraq and convert them all to Christianity&#8221; or opining about how best to deploy troops some troops (&#8220;we really should be holding ground in Falluja&#8221;) seems to be a lot of fun, especially since those who have played this game have been able to ignore all the inconvenient facts until recently.  </p>
<p>Let us, this one time, play this game that the supporters and admirers and cheerleaders have been having so much fun with, but without ignoring the hard facts and the realities.  If you work for the general staff, your boss just told you the President wants to win this thing (whatever that means), and you&#8217;re getting 20,000 more troops to do it.  Nobody has any idea of what to do &#8211; if they had, they&#8217;d have done it already.  So they tell you to think out of the box &#8211; they want you to come up with the plan that nobody has thought of yet, but that has a reasonable shot at, if not achieving the President&#8217;s ill-defined goals, at least of making things a bit better. What can you do with the existing troop levels plus 20K to at least make the situation better?  (Assume you can&#8217;t turn down the troops, you can&#8217;t resign, and you can&#8217;t pull off anything outside the realm of likelihood like making Sadr into a Southern Baptist.)</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>So today, the Generals have come out in favor of <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-troops23dec23,0,2095230.story?coll=la-home-headlines">more troops</a> in Iraq.  Just the other day, they were against more troops.  In other words, something (could it be the administration?) has caused them to change their minds about the importance of more troops, allowing GW to get his wish &#8211; the &#8220;one last big push&#8221; scheme and still say he&#8217;s doing only what the generals want him to do.</p>
<p>(Ironically, a few years back, things went the other way.  We all remember what happened when the generals spoke up about the need for more troops in the beginning of the war&#8230;.)</p>
<p>Now, the problem with this the scheme the military is now endorsing seems to be that, well, the military doesn&#8217;t know what its endorsing because it hasn&#8217;t been told by the administration yet, and the administration is making it up as they go along:</p>
<p>&#8220;Those skeptical about the efficacy of an increase argue that any new troops must be given clear instructions. However, defense officials say the U.S. commanders in Iraq have not settled on what that mission should be, although they are expected to decide before calling up new units.&#8221;</p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;m wrong, but I&#8217;m not seeing a good outcome to this &#8211; we&#8217;re seeing an administration that tends to be  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">incredibly wrong</a> grasping at straws about to roll the dice with other peoples&#8217; lives supported by the same bunch of cheerleaders who have been wrong about everything else so far.  So what happens next year, when the last big push, whatever it turns out to be, has come to a screeching halt?  Anyone have a guess?</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>David Cay Johnston is a very unique creature – he is a reporter at a major newspaper who writes about taxes well, and he makes the subject matter interesting.  His <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/business/21tax.html?ex=1324357200&#038;en=2f6f11bb413a1a7d&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">latest</a>, in the NY Times, is one of the best I’ve read.  Its hard not to just get myself in trouble and copy and paste the whole thing.  </p>
<p>Basically, among other things, the article showed that there were fewer of audits of big companies last year, and the time spent on each audit has dropped by 21% over the past five years.  However, additional tax dollars recommended (is this the amount actually collected?  I suspect not) by the IRS per audit have increased.  An IRS spokesman said this was proof that the IRS was working more efficiently.</p>
<p>Now, an economist – at least one that hadn’t sold his or her soul to the administration, might conclude otherwise.  Reducing the number of audits reduces the probability of detection.  As far as I know, the penalties for getting caught have not been increased.  (In fact, this administration has a reputation for going easy on businesses.)  This would mean the expected gains to cheating have increased markedly, leading to a greater amount of cheating – both in terms of number of cheats and the size of the average cheat.</p>
<p>Therefore, what is going on is simple – the administration is “recommending” more tax dollars only because the amount of underpayment has increased.  (I wouldn’t be at all surprised if the increase in the recommended additional taxes is much smaller than the increase in underpayment, which in turn encourages even more cheating.)  </p>
<p>The article also has several other little gems, including one about how the IRS has not been entirely forthcoming with data they are required, by court order, to provide.  The article is short, and well worth a read.</p>

<blockquote>Democratic leaders in the new Congress plan to strip funding for thousands of pet projects for individual members, a big display of fiscal discipline they say will help cut deficits and curb spending abuses. As soon as they take control on Jan. 4, Democrats plan to impose a one-year moratorium on all special projects, known as earmarks, effectively killing those that were tucked into unfinished spending bills by the Republican-led Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll admit that some of the earmark cuts will hurt certain folks.  I’ll also admit that a one-year moratorium is a drop in the bucket when compared to the overall deficit.  But we have to start somewhere.  And here is my favorite part:<br />
<blockquote>In a joint statement released earlier this month, Sen. Robert Bryd, D-Va., and Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., the incoming chairmen of the Senate and House appropriations committees, said that the moratorium will remain in effect &#8220;until a reformed process is put in place&#8221; and that earmarks included in this year&#8217;s House and Senate bills will be eligible for consideration in 2008. They said the moratorium is the result of &#8220;fiscal mayhem&#8221; left over by the Republican Congress. &#8220;Republicans have spent years handing out billions upon billions of dollars in tax cuts to millionaires while shortchanging our national priorities,&#8221; Obey said. &#8220;It is going to take us years to get back on track.&#8221; The moratorium has the backing of President Bush, who called it &#8220;a good start&#8221; toward imposing fiscal discipline on Capitol Hill.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robert Byrd and George W. Bush working together to get a reformed process to end earmarks!  I would never anticipated this bipartisan effort from these two in particular.</p>
