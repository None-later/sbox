                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Some on the right have decided to suggest we liberals know nothing about economics.  There was the Greg Mankiw claim that no real economist could support a higher minimum wage and then there was the Alan Reynolds claim that no real economist could doubt the superiority of consumption-based measures of inequality.  And now <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTE1MWVhZGQxMjlhMjNlYzk5ZTU3M2JjOWY4NzE5NTU">Thomas Sowell</a> follows suit over at the National Review:<br />
<blockquote>People in the media, in academia, and among the intelligentsia in general who are obsessed with “disparities” in income and wealth usually show not the slightest interest in how that income and wealth were produced in the first place. They are hot to redistribute the existing income and wealth but seem wholly unaware that how you do that today can affect how much income and wealth will be produced tomorrow &#8230; Progressives” in the media and among academics and intellectuals claim to be interested in ending poverty but the production of more output is the only way to end poverty for millions of people &#8230; The real obsession of the Left is in gaining power or, at the very least, engaging in moral exhibitionism.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see – unless you support George W. Bush’s crony capitalism and his attempt to shift the tax burden away from the rich (aka Dooh Nibor economics), you are not only an idiot but you are also morally inferior to the great Thomas Sowell.  You see – Paul Krugman only plays an economist on TV. </p>
<p>Pardon my French – but this is a load of manure. But it’s the kind of manure we’ve come to expect from Sowell when he writes for the rag known as the National Review.  Economists for years have considered both equity and efficiency considerations at the same time.  And real economists know that “giving people their money back” so they can consume more reduces long-term growth.  But the nitwits at the National Review still preach the free lunch supply-side garbage that ignores the most basic premise of all economics – the law of scarcity.  Or maybe I should use the macroeconomic terms for the law of scarcity, which is crowding-out, given the fact that Sowell is hanging out with the Lawrence Kudlow crowd who missed this particular lecture during their Econ 101 class.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>“In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem….  It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government.”</p>
<p>Ronald Reagan’s First Inaugural Address, January 20, 1981</p>
<p>Every so often, I like to check things that everyone knows are true.  Its amazing how often it turns out that something we all know is true doesn’t seem to mesh with the data for some reason.</p>
<p>One thing we all know to be true, at least those of us who are from the good old US of A (I know there are some of them foreigner people that read this blog, and I suspect one or two of them may even be French!) is that the private sector is more efficient than the public sector.  Presumably this means that the greater the government’s share of the economy, the slower growth (say, growth in real GDP per capita) will be.</p>
<p>Well, this is self-evidently true, but let’s plug in some numbers, just for grins.  Everything we need is available from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/TableView.asp#Mid">NIPA Tables</a>.</p>
<p>Table 1.1.6 gives us data on Real GDP and its components (including total federal plus state and local Government consumption expenditures and investment).  From this we can determine government’s share of the total economy.  Going back to 1950, this figure hit a peak of about 34.33% in 1953, and bottomed out at 17.53% in 2000.  </p>
<p>(I note that post-Gerald Ford, government’s share of the economy rose as high as 22% three times.  Each time was under Ronald Reagan, and the last time was in 1986.  So much for Ronald Reagan being a small government kind of guy compared to, say, Jimmy Carter.)  </p>
<p>Government shrunk as a percentage of the economy every single year under Clinton, reaching a minimum of 17.5% in 2000.  Since then, its had ups and downs, and in 2005, was at about 17.7%.  (Obviously, given the massive growth in the Federal budget under GW, that’s due mostly to state and local government shrinking relative to the economy as a whole.)  </p>
<p>NIPA Table 7.1 gives us real GDP per capita, from which we can compute annual percentage change in real GDP per capita.</p>
<p>The table below shows the correlation between real annual percentage growth rate in GDP per capita, and government as a percentage the economy in period t-X.</p>
<p>X__Correlation<br />0___-0.00871<br />1___0.03625<br />2___0.04079<br />3___0.03249<br />4___0.01029<br />5___-0.01209<br />10__0.20349<br />15__0.08522<br />20__0.07019<br />25__0.16416<br />30__0.07019</p>
<p>Now, this is simplistic a simplistic analysis, but ten to 25 years out, spending by the private sector is not more likely to lead to growth than spending by the government, and in fact, the opposite may well be true.  (I note that using more sophisticated tools a few years back doing something similar, I got similar results.)  </p>
<p>Possible reasons why this result might be observed:</p>
<p>1.  It could all be an illusion.  A different period of time might show different results.  Long time readers will note I simply picked the time period I normally pick when the data is available.  I start at 1950 to give the economy enough time to get over the effects of the Great Depression and WW2, which were special cases if there were any.</p>
<p>2.  Government spending may be more geared toward the long term.  Spending on education and infrastructure, for example, take a long time to pay off.</p>
<p>3.  Government spending is geared toward institutions that are necessary for the long term functioning of the economy.  Even the DMV, which is always exhibit A of inefficiency, is never privately run – perhaps because doing so is difficult.  Eliminate the DMV and society can continue relatively unchanged for a year, or two… but eventually things break down.</p>
<p>4.  Market failures mean the profit motive creates private sector incentives that are inefficient and violate the Invisible Hand outcome – creating excess pollution and otherwise imposing private costs on third parties, generating paperwork rather than output (e.g., think the health insurance industry), etc.  Arguably, a significant part of the legal and accounting industries are geared toward increasing deception and obfuscation, and often these are among the most lucrative private sector careers open to a lot of people.</p>
<p>5.  In the private sector, there is often more gain to exploiting short-term inefficiencies that might well disappear by themselves anyway than there is to producing anything real, which is a tremendous waste of resources.  (Think number of stockbrokers.)</p>
<p>6.  The private sector is made up of people.  People are lazy in the private sector just as they are lazy in the public sector.</p>
<p>Two additional commentaries about the these results</p>
<p>1.  These results are for the US, for the range of government to private sector observed in the data.  Anyone who tries to extrapolate from this that having the US government run the entire economy will be more efficient is a fool.  At what ratio of government to private sector do we start seeing more government sector inefficiencies and fewer private sector inefficiencies?  Well, who knows?  That would require a lot more work, and this is an unpaid hobby.</p>
<p>2.  It may be that with different accounting rules, private sector spending’s advantage over government spending (note the extremely low correlations) might disappear altogether.  Government spending appears in ledgers at cost whereas private sector spending includes improvements made.  This accounting artifact makes private sector spending look more efficient than it is in the short term.</p>
<p>Since today I seem to be enumerating, let me try enumerating one more thing… why do we believe in this private sector is efficient myth?  I can think of a few reasons offhand:</p>
<p>1.  The Private Sector accounts for over 80% of the economy.  Most people work in the private sector.  We have a vested interest in believing we’re better than the alternative.</p>
<p>2.  The media, which tells us how everything works, is in the hands of the private sector.  They have a vested interested in believing the private sector is better than the alternative.</p>
<p>3.  Media’s advertisers are in the private sector.  They have a vested interested in all of us believing the private sector is better than the alternative.</p>
<p>4.  One of the purposes of government is to set rules and correct market failures.  But a very, very big part of the private sector is geared specifically toward finding ways around those rules and exploiting market failures.  Criticizing government is a way to justify such anti-social behavior, or at least focus attention elsewhere.</p>

<blockquote><p>By NBER dating, the economy had already been in recession for just short of a year when he made this speech and was only 5 months away from pulling out of it. The labor market is a lagging indicator, so while the unemployment rate was still high</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://nber.com/cycles/cyclesmain.html">NBER</a> does show the economy peaking in 1973QIV and hit its trough in 1975QI.   This dating is consistent with the real GDP data that I noted in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/gerald-fords-win-strategy.html">my update</a>.    </p>
<p>Bill and I (as well as others) have the luxury of looking at this from a historical perspective.  But the real question is what did the President’s economic advisors know at the time when policy decisions had to be made and what did they advise the President?  Even today – economists debate whether aggregate demand should have been restrained to fight inflation or whether we needed aggregate demand expansion to offset the recession?  </p>
<p>I suspect <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/12/was_win_a_loser.html">David Altig</a> would have preferred monetary restraint, which also seems to be what <a href="http://www.scsuscholars.com/2006/12/ford-couldnt-win.html">King Banaian</a> would have counseled.  Had the three of us served on Ford’s CEA, I would have argued for aggregate demand expansion.  But hey – the 1970’s was a very difficult period for policy makers and their economic advisors.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>So says <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002751.html#more">Max Sawicky</a> in comments related to Paul Krugman’s op ed in the NY Times and commented on here at AB by pgl and cactus and elsewhere by many more.  Apart from being unable to resist titling a post with Max’s line it is my turn to weigh in on this.
</p>
<p>First, I completely agree with Max.  There is no way to make a deal with feces flinging monkeys and even if you did they would just undo it the next chance they got, chortling all the while about “patsies” and “playing hardball”.  So what are we to do?  Responsible people (not just economists) should want to do the right thing for the country, but if all that means is enabling another round of Republican irresponsibility then it is easy to see why Krugman, Max and others say the moral equivalent of  “ah f&#8212; it” lets just spend on what WE want because otherwise the government will just get ratcheted down to what THEY want.  Until, that is, we hit the wall a la <country-region><place>Argentina</place></country-region> and have to reset our policies after an orgy of economic bloodletting.</p>
<p>Now I haven’t given up hope that we can drive a stake through the heart of the mindless Scarlett O’Hara republicanism that has come to characterize the right wing in recent years.  (“Fiddle dee dee.  I’ll worry about that tomorrow”)  But there is no guarantee of this given the inability of many in the Democratic leadership to go for the jugular when they have the chance.  And in economic discussions of fiscal policy there is little specificity about what we ought to want – a fact that plays in to my perennial peeve with discussions about fiscal policy.  Way too much time is spent debating overall balance, spending and taxes without any reference to WHAT it is being spent on.  Of course this is not universally true and the balances are very important &#8211; see pgl’s post of yesterday for example, not to mention some of mine &#8211; but if we really do want to do what is right for the economy in the long run then the thing to focus on when we are in power is building an economy that is resistant to the feces flinging that may someday come.
</p>
<p>Previous commenters on Krugman’s op ed have focused on the question of whether we should or should not bother bringing things back into balance only to have the Republicans wreck it all again.  I share the pessimism of many on this front which leads me to want to spend on what we want as opposed to what they want.  But even within what WE want there are some choices that make for a more feces-resistant future than others.  In short, we can improve the future not only by trying climb out of deficit on the spending side but also by accumulating capital that will generate future income which we can then tax.  </p>
<p>What is in and what is out if we are trying to protect capital spending and preventing growth in recurrent expenses?  Here is a brief and nowhere near exhaustive list &#8211;  IN would be spending on physical capital such as roads, ports or other public goods.  Also in would be spending on human capital, particularly education.  Also in would be spending on research and development – My own favorites are new energy technologies and various biomedical technologies.  OUT would be increased defense spending, increases in transfers which end up largely as consumption or subsidies to corporations that already make a profit.  Unfortunately, given my personal druthers, this line of thinking also says we might want to go slowly on new entitlement programs that are not directly productive such as Medicare for all though one could make a good argument that this is both protection for human capital and economic “grease” to make our economy more efficient and competitive.</p>
<p>Bottom line?  The Republicans have shown in the past 10 years that they do not negotiate in good faith.  In fact, they often don’t negotiate at all.  What we do has to take that as a fact for the time being, but there is still a policy direction that is “optimal” in the long run sense even if it isn’t what we would have chosen if grownups ran the Republican party.</p>

                                <p>Something in the thread of a recent post, and Steven Kyle&#8217;s recent post on short term trading horizons, reminded me of a question I&#8217;ve had for a long time&#8230;  what was up with Enron?  Who knows&#8230; it may even have been possible for most people above the janitor&#8217;s pay scale in the Houston headquarters not to know (if they went out of their way not to know) that the numbers didn&#8217;t add up.  (I personally doubt it, and perhaps in some other post I&#8217;ll go into details why I reach that conclusion, having been in that headquarters for a day at the end of the year 2000.)  However, at least some people, not only knew but knew the details.</p>
<p>Now, assuming you have the moral standards that allow you to go along or participate in such an environment, the rational thing is to go along, but walk away with a lot of cash before the inevitable end.  Now, it may be tough to spot the inevitable end &#8211; perhaps the temptation is there to always stick around just a bit longer &#8211; but as I recall, only one of the big boys, Lou Pai, actually showed any signs of doing just that.  I should hasten to note that Lou Pai, though he headed a few of Enron&#8217;s divisions and left the company with over $250 million payout 6 months before the end, has not, as far as I can tell, been alleged to have committed any wrong-doing.</p>
<p>But Enron is not a special case where the folks running the shell game decide to stay on long after the gig is up.  We all can name other instances where it happened in corporate America.  And it will happen again.</p>
<p>But its not just corporate America.  For example, I had a post a while back showing that, using data available in 2000, one should have anticipated that cutting taxes was going to lead to reductions, not increases in revenue.  Now, I don&#8217;t doubt GW was ignorant, but his economic advisors had to have the skills to do the analysis.  Maybe you couldn&#8217;t tell at the time that we would have, for the first time in history (at least of the data that the OMB has up), 3 consecutive years in which nominal tax revenues declined, but you could tell that the Economic Blueprint was BS.  And yet, smart guys went along with it.  Heck, they&#8217;re still going along with it now.  (And why not&#8230; in this case, they&#8217;re making out well, being hired by the Romney organization to do the same for yet another candidate.)</p>
<p>And its not just something involving business or economics.  Even GW had to know a year ago that things were not fine in Iraq, let alone a Rumsfeld or a Cheney.  But a bunch of smart guys (and GW too) continued to the peddle the line that all was well.  A bunch of cheerleaders too.</p>
<p>So why do people continue propping up the house of cards after it has started falling?  Why do so few of the rats try to leave until its too late?</p>

<p>I’ve been looking for a reason to return to the politics of this fiscal game of chicken and in his own unique way, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002751.html">Max Sawicky</a> opens the door:<br />
<blockquote>Here as well, the problem is not only the economics, but the political reality that in matters of budgetary scruples, the Democrats are trying to hold a formal dinner with a pack of feces-flinging monkeys.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since there is no way I can top this analogy, let’s turn to where Alberto Alesina and Allan Drazen ask <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v81y1991i5p1170-88.html">Why Are Stabilizations Delayed?</a>:  <br />
<blockquote>When a stabilization has significant distributional implications (e.g., tax increases to eliminate a large budget deficit), socioeconomic groups may attempt to shift the burden of stabilization onto other groups. The process leading to stabilization becomes a &#8220;war of attrition,&#8221; each group attempting to wait the others out and stabilization occurring only when one group concedes and bears a disproportionate share of the burden.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the important Alesina-Drazen contribution that <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/12/krugman-on-deficit.html">Greg Mankiw</a> brought to our attention.  While I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/fiscal-insanity-mankiw-as-krugmans.html">thanked</a> him for the reminder, AB readers know that I reject the implication that the fault lies with the Social Security program.  Thanks for the various comments especially the one from Dale who really gets it.  As David Wright tries to defend Mankiw, it seems I owe our readers some historical detail in terms of certain graphs that range from 1947 to 2005.  The graphs define Federal expenditure as the sum of defense spending (Def), Non-defense Federal purchases (Nondef), and non-interest transfers (Tran) – all as a percent of GDP.  They define Federal revenue as the sum of income taxes (Tax) and Payroll Contributions (PC) again as a percent of GDP.  I leave off interest expenses to focus on the primary deficit – something that Greg once suggested as well.  </p>
<p>The first graph compares the two sums.  I view the 1947 to 2005 period as being in four parts.  The first part was period where the Federal debt to GDP ratio fell from 110.3% in 1947 to 32.6% in 1981 as we tried to run primary surpluses.  During wars (Korea and Vietnam) and recessions, the primary surplus switched to deficit, but in general – both Republican and Democratic Administrations were committed to paying down the debt.  The second period involved the Reagan years. In terms of the Alesina-Drazen paper, the GOP was taken over by conservatives who may have wanted a smaller government but never really bothered to give us one.  What the Reagan Administration did was to increase defense spending and defer taxation.  But we Democrats do praise President Reagan for the 1983 Social Security reforms, which we’ll discuss shortly.  The third period was the 1990’s, which reversed this 1980’s fiscal game of chicken by partially reversing the Reagan tax “cuts” and by partially scaling back defense spending.  Mind you – the GOP universally opposed the 1993 tax increase and kept making noise about increasing defense spending – especially in neoconservative circles.  Alas, the fourth period was the reign of the neoconservatives where defense spending was raised as President George W. Bush pretended to give us tax “cuts”.  And it would seem this President wants to make his tax cuts and his higher defense spending permanent.  If you think I’m blaming those who support President Bush for the current fiscal game of chicken, I am.  But let’s return to the central Alesina-Drazen question:<br />
<blockquote>When a stabilization has significant distributional implications (e.g., tax increases to eliminate a large budget deficit), socioeconomic groups may attempt to shift the burden of stabilization onto other groups.</p></blockquote>
<p>Those conservatives who think this is a battle as to the size of the Federal government in terms of government purchases are either sadly informed or being dishonest.  Our second graph helps us understand why.  Non-defense Federal purchases are only 2.3% of GDP.  OK, they were only 1.8% of GDP in 1947 but both Republican and Democratic Administrations agreed a long time ago to the increases in non-defense spending.  Is the Republican Party saying that the government should do less in terms of maintaining a highway system or public education?  I doubt it.  I do know that the GOP is for more defense spending – not less.  So let’s be honest – this is all about the tax/transfer payment system.  </p>
<p>Transfer payments as a share of GDP did rise during the 1960’s and 1970’s as the Federal government declared a war on poverty and increased the role of the Social Security system.  How was this increase in transfer payments financed?  Certainly not be increasing income taxes as a share of GDP.  Rather – we have seen a dramatic increase in payroll contributions.  Part of that increase was due to the 1983 Social Security reform.  We Democrats have praised President Reagan for recognizing that if the Social Security Trust Fund was to have the funds to pay for the retirement benefits of the baby boomers, then we needed to raise the payroll tax so as to build a Trust Fund reserve over time.  </p>
<p>I thought the 1983 reforms were an honest bipartisan deal.  But the Republican Party since the Contract With (or was that On) America leaves me wondering.  On the one hand, President Bush in his 2001 State of the Union address pledged to honor our Social Security commitments as he also pledged to pay down the Federal debt.  But he also promised all sorts of new spending plus those tax cuts.  How could this all be?  You see – there was this giant bait-and-switch from talking about total Federal debt and the General Fund deficit to publicly held debt and the unified deficit.  Even in our best recent years, which were Clinton’s second term, total Federal debt did not fall even in real terms.  So the idea that there was a huge surplus simply wasn’t true in terms of the General Fund.  So what does President Bush and his enablers (which include Greg Mankiw) do?  They talk about the unified deficit, which has declined since the great reversal of fortunes during Bush’s first term only because the Trust Fund surpluses have predictably grown &#8211; something about us baby boomers paying into the Social Security Trust Fund on the premise that these are not employment taxes but rather payroll contributions.  But oh no says Greg Mankiw – the fiscal crisis is that our legions are growing and we might expect our retirement benefits be paid.  Now Greg Mankiw et al. know that the baby boom demographic deluge was known in the 1980’s so why the surprise?  Stupidity? Mendacity? You decide.  </p>
<p>Kent Smetters asked the right question: <a href="http://irm.wharton.upenn.edu/WP-security-Smetters.pdf">Is the Social Security Trust Fund Worth Anything?</a>.  Smetter notes two views of how we view the Federal deficit.  He specifically notes folks like Paul Krugman who would view the Social Security Trust Fund reserves as the prefunding of the baby boomer’s retirement benefits and who would logically focus on the General Fund deficit for the rest of Federal finances.  I obviously agree with Paul.  Greg, on the other hand, incessantly talks about the unified deficit as do others as if there was never any intent by President Reagan and the Social Security commission headed by Alan Greenspan to live up to what they said in 1983.  Well, we know Dr. Greenspan flip-flopped on this pledge in 2001.  Given Ronald Reagan is no longer with us, I choose to believe he was never so dishonest.  </p>
<p>Many conservatives dance on the head of a pin as to which side of the Smetters question they come down.  The only conservative economist that has been clear to my knowledge is our friend David Altig who is of the belief that politicians have renounced the 1983 deal.  David does not endorse such double dealing, but I can see his point. My problem is that Republican politicians not only double deal – they also doublespeak by saying they want to preserve Social Security.  Any economist worth his salt knows such doublespeak is very dishonest.  We should also note that to tell workers that they are paying more into the Social Security system for their retirement benefits only to spend that money on reductions in tax rates on capital income is grand larceny.  I guess it is too much to expect such grand larcenists to be honest as they pick our pockets.  But we should expect conservative economists such as Greg Mankiw to be as honest as David Altig had been and actually answer the Smetters question.  Oh wait – such honesty might so inform the average Americans that they elect Democrats who will end this game of chicken without picking the pockets of middle class workers.  Which is why we should expect this dishonesty from Republican politicians to continue.  </p>
<p>So to answer my question – the fiscal game of chicken was started by a pack of feces-flinging monkeys.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In a recent post <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/12/controlling_mal.html">Mark Thoma</a> quotes Jeff Sachs and several other commentators on the issue of providing antimalarial bednets free of charge in <place st="on">Africa</place> vs. charging a subsidized amount in order to promote “the market”.  Mark T. poses this as an evidentiary question – Do payments in fact generate positive results?  I agree that this is an evidentiary issue but I fear that  the wrong question is being asked.</p>
<p>First, when you are heavily subsidizing something you are missing a big part of the problem if you obsess on the issue of whether the subsidy is for 95% of the cost or 100%.  I don’t for a minute want to belittle the importance of that 5% to a very poor person but it is very very important not to lose sight of a fundamental fact:  Either way, we are NOT talking about anything like a “market”.  We are of necessity talking about administratively providing (either through the government or an aid organization) bednets and medicines in a transaction where the profit incentive is nowhere to be found for anyone.  That isn’t like any actual market transaction I know of.  It is a grant and the issue of a token payment revolves around issues of psychology for the recipient and not on any kind of market.</p>
<p>Second, there is a long history in <place st="on">Africa</place> and elsewhere of providing things for free or nearly so and then watching the whole effort collapse as soon as the aid is gone.  Of course, quite often the aid never gets where it is supposed to in the first place because of governmental incompetence and corruption.  One can find examples of free or subsidized credit.  One can find examples galore of free or subsidized fertilizer or seeds.  There are other examples but the point is that the history of such programs is pretty terrible because not only do they usually fail in their goals, but they fail in the fundamental objective of sustainability – Once the subsidy is gone then so is the program and its benefits along with it.</p>
<p>I am not arguing against the humanitarian need to help those in malarial areas.  What I am saying is that we should, if we can, do it in a way that will not depend on a never ending stream of aid from rich countries to maintain success because if there is one thing we know from history it is that aid is NEVER infinite.  There is always a new humanitarian disaster or fad in development giving to switch to.  That means that giving stuff for free is great if you are on a campaign where a realistically attainable goal is the complete eradication of the disease involved so that the aid is never needed again.  If that is not the case, or if there is a more development friendly way to do it, then the issue gets a bit more complicated.</p>
<p>What would a REAL market based solution look like?  Well, for one thing, a sustainable market in bednets in <place st="on">Africa</place> ought to involve not just local purchase but local manufacture as well.  An actual market has both a supply side and a demand side and there is no reason at all we shouldn’t promote both sides if we want a healthy market to be sustained in the future.  Lets face it, bednets are not high technology, and if they were made in <place st="on">Africa</place> costs would be much lower than if they were made abroad – allowing not only lower prices but an interested party in the recipient country motivated to promote its product and whose sales would themselves contribute to economic growth.  If we need to subsidize something, why not help the local entrepreneur overcome whatever barriers there are to a thriving bednet business?  If foreign aid agencies really want to help then they can buy the nets locally but even better would be help in marketing them as widely as possible.</p>
<p>This approach might be a bit slower but it would also have the benefit of lasting longer.  Jeff Sachs is right to be appalled that we are not doing more.  But the best long run solution may not hinge on the question of whether the subsidy should be 95% vs. 100%.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2006/12/#000747">Bill Polley</a> pays tribute to the late President Gerald Ford by commenting on his <a href="http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/speeches/740121.htm">Whip Inflation Now</a> strategy:<br />
<blockquote>Looking back on the proposal, we see that he got some things right, but of course it wasn&#8217;t until the Federal Reserve got serious about things that inflation really started to come under control. Ford wanted to remove acreage restrictions on farming, improve enforcement of antitrust laws, and improve energy conservation. He rejected price controls (a welcome departure from Nixon&#8217;s policies) and even called for increased taxes (though he later called for tax cuts). All of these were steps in the right direction for a number of reasons (many of which not having to do with inflation) but it wasn&#8217;t great strategy. Asking people to walk to work and waste less food was not going to cut it when M2 money stock was growing at double-digit rates. Economically speaking, it wasn&#8217;t a shining moment.</p></blockquote>
<p>Take a look at the fourth part of this 10-point proposal:<br />
<blockquote>We need more capital. We cannot &#8220;eat up our seed corn.&#8221; Our free enterprise system depends on orderly capital markets through which the savings of our people become productively used. Today, our capital markets are in total disarray. We must restore their vitality. Prudent monetary restraint is essential. You and the American people should know, however, that I have personally been assured by the Chairman of the independent Federal Reserve Board that the supply of money and credit will expand sufficiently to meet the needs of our economy and that in no event will a credit crunch occur. The prime lending rate is going down. To help industry to buy more machines and create more jobs, I am recommending a liberalized 10 percent investment tax credit. This credit should be especially helpful to capital-intensive industries such as primary metals, public utilities, where capacity shortages have developed. I am asking Congress to enact tax legislation to provide that all dividends on preferred stocks issued for cash be fully deductible by the issuing company. This should bring in more capital, especially for energy-producing utilities. It will also help other industries shift from debt to equity, providing a sounder capital structure. Capital gains tax legislation must be liberalized as proposed by the tax reform bill currently before the Committee on Ways and Means. I endorse this approach and hope that it will pass promptly.</p></blockquote>
<p>This baffles the mind – the President calls for monetary restraint but then says he and the Federal Reserve want the money supply to grow rapidly enough to lower interest rates.  He also asked for tax cuts to spur investment demand.  The President’s sixth proposal calls for stimulating housing demand.  Only later does the President call for fiscal restraint by proposing tax increases and spending cuts.  </p>
<p>But Bill is correct that the President later changed his mind on fiscal policy.  Ford decided to push for a tax cut to stimulate aggregate demand but only if Congress cut government spending by an equal amount.  Didn’t the CEA remind the President about the <a href="http://www.economyprofessor.com/economictheories/balanced-budget-multiplier.php">balanced budget multiplier</a>? </p>
<p>By the time Gerald Ford made this speech, the unemployment rate had increased from 4.9% to 5.9%.  By May 1975, the unemployment rate reached 9% and still at 7.7% when voters went to the polls to decide between Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter.  My problem with the WIN program was less its details and more with the fact that this President seemed to ignore the fact that we were on the verge of a rather significant recession.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/12/27/news/newsmakers/gerald_ford/index.htm?postversion=2006122716">Christian Zappone</a> does the Ford economy legacy piece for CNN/Money:<br />
<blockquote>Gerald Ford&#8217;s presidential term was as much marked by the economic forces of inflation as it was by the political fortunes of the time.  Ford, who was sworn in as president on Aug. 9, 1974, after the resignation of Richard Nixon, faced inflation that was already surging at a 10.9 percent annual rate in that month. It was thrust into overdrive by the OPEC oil embargo of 1974 and the elimination of wage/price controls instituted in the Nixon administration &#8230; Rising energy prices also contributed to higher unemployment by slowing consumer demand for companies&#8217; products, according to Mark Ratkus, economics professor at LaSalle University in Philadelphia.  Ford&#8217;s approach to controlling inflation, according to his White House biography, was through modest tax cuts and spending restraints. He also sought to &#8220;decontrol&#8221; energy prices in order to stimulate production … &#8220;Up to that time, we&#8217;d never had inflation and higher unemployment,&#8221; Ratkus explained. &#8220;It created a stagnant economy and a term that has since entered into textbooks: &#8216;stagflation.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The only cause of the Ford recession was higher energy costs?  The fact that short-term interest rates had climbed to 9% by the time Nixon left office and Ford’s attempts to use fiscal restraint had nothing to do with this? The BEA reports that real GDP fell by 3.1% or $135.7 billion (in 2000$) from 1973QIV to 1975QI.   The drop in consumption was only $17.6 billion, while investment demand fell by $162.4 billion.  And yet, CNN/Money blames higher energy costs leading to a drop in consumption for the 1974 recession!</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><stockticker>PGL</stockticker>’s post earlier in the week about yields on US bonds and the lack of a default premium got me thinking about how far into the future traders really think.  I don’t for a second want to get into a debate about the US government defaulting – I think that is a very low probability event though it is probably worth thinking about what would happen in a future where the US Treasury found it more difficult to cover its obligations than it does at the present time.  In fact, the many debates about a hard vs. soft landing are at least in part debates about exactly this, but one common thread to many of the hard landing scenarios is much higher interest rates.  So even if there isn’t a default we still have the question of why this possibility (some would say probability) isn’t priced in at the moment since there is no lack of evidence that bonds from other countries respond quite strongly to default risk.</p>
<p>I had a previous incarnation as a bond trader.  I worked in the Treasury at the World Bank where I traded the Bank’s holdings in the UK Gilt market (British government bonds) back in the 1980’s.  It taught me more about capital markets, monetary policy and exchange rates than graduate school did but it also brought me into close contact with traders and market participants of all types since I had one of the largest and most actively traded portfolios in the market.</p>
<p>My marching orders were “Don’t lose money and make some if you can”.  It is fair to say that my colleagues in the Bank and I had very long horizons compared to other traders in the market for two reasons – First, our salaries didn’t depend on our trading decisions (How I wish that weren’t true – I would be a much richer economist today …) and second, we computed our performance on a very ad hoc basis, with grand evaluations vs. various benchmarks on a quarterly basis.  Even then, a poor showing in one quarter just meant a reevaluation of strategy for the next in a portfolio where monthly and quarterly changes were not regarded as fundamental indicators.</p>
<p>What of the other traders and institutions?  My impression of most of them is that they cared desperately how their book looked at the end of each and every day.  The end of the week was important and the end of the month a cause for extreme anxiety.  A bad quarter could well be career changing.  A bad year and they were looking for a job.  (By the way, WE thought bond traders were paragons of futuristic thinking compared to currency traders with whom we communicated regularly.  Those guys bet immense sums and flip them back and forth within a trading day.  They seemed to me to have the attention span of a flea.)</p>
<p>So the point of this post is to solicit opinions.  Down there in the trenches the capital markets didn’t seem nearly as perfect and all seeing as they are often painted.  Indeed, it was possible to make some large sums of money exploiting what looked like obvious profit opportunities to us.  Could it just be that the people making the decisions aren’t thinking about what will happen in 20 years?    And 20 years is well beyond the professional lifetime of most bond traders – How many 45 and 50 year olds do you see on a trading floor?  Remember, even many of their bosses are just traders who graduated to management after a while. </p>
<p>    Could the explanation for the lack of a default premium in US bonds be partly due to the fact that it is far in the future as compared to default premia on other countries’ bonds where the threatened disaster is more imminent?  Or is it just that such a default really is unthinkable and so gets a low enough probability in traders’ minds as to be undetectable?</p>
