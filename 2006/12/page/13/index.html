                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Before I tell you who the GOP should nominate and why I might vote for him, let me turn to a few of the Sunday talking head low points via one of my favorite liberal political blogs.  First up is <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/12/03/wall-street-journal-iraq">Paul Gigot</a> on Faux News saying Stay the Course is the right policy.  Next up is <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/12/03/hadley-rumsfeld-iraq">Stephen Hadley</a> dancing on the head of a pin.  Since many of you are thinking those were too cheap shots, you may be right, but let me take a couple of more at George Bush’s favorite Democrat – Senator Lieberman.  First, he endorses <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/12/03/lieberman-iraq-troops">more troops</a> in Iraq and then he makes a fool out of himself by <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/12/03/lieberman-iran-syria">dissing real foreign policy</a>. </p>
<p>But you might have surmised the point of the last link was to show Senator Chuck Hagel in contrast to Lieberman.  Yes, I watched Face the Nation and thought to myself, this guy gets it and knows how to tell the truth.  Hagel may be a lot more conservative than I am, but what I want most in the next President of the United States is leadership.  A prerequisite of leadership is integrity and as I think of the field of GOP wannabes, no one comes close to Senator Hagel.  Now if he could only tell me how he would restore fiscal responsibility &#8230;</p>

                                                                            <a href="./../../../category/cats/index.html" class="post-category-2283" title="cats"><div class="color-box"></div>cats</a>                                                                     </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Every so often, someone comes up with a study showing that religious conservatives are more generous than secular liberals. Recently, there’s been <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Who-Really-Cares-Compassionate-Conservatism/dp/0465008216">another one</a>.</p>
<p>I haven’t read this book. But I have read excerpts, and unless I’m wrong, the book makes what to me is the same errors that previous efforts to prove the same thing have made.</p>
<p>The first error is that it assumes that any activity centered around a religious organization is charity.</p>
<p>I lived in the South for a number of years. At the time, I noticed that in much of that region, a lot of a town’s social life revolves around the local Church(es). And its not just Sunday services either.</p>
<p>Consider a typical family living in Searcy, Arkansas. Let’s go further, and assume its the kind of typical family the folks in Searcy would proudly call their own. The kids go to camp run by the Church, and they play basketball every day after school on the courts behind the Church. The mom is a member of a Church book club. The dad goes there to hear lectures on one or another topic. Part of family entertainment includes Church fairs, Church-sponsored trips to Little Rock to watch the Arkansas Travelers minor league ball team or up to Fayetteville to watch of the U of Arkansas Hogs play football, the occasional Church play, and of course, Sunday services.</p>
<p>From what I can tell, when they pony up money to the Church for each of these activities, they’re engaging in tax deductible charity.</p>
<p>Now, consider a family of Godless heathens in pagan Los Angeles. The kids play soccer in some league… league fees are not tax deductible, and not charity. The mom is a member of a book club… none of those costs are considered charity. The dad shows up at the occasional lecture series for one or another local university… nothing charity related here. And going to Disneyland, watching the Galaxy or the Dodgers or the Lakers, or going to the beach are not considered to be Charity.</p>
<p>The second error is that many forms of charity fall below the radar, especially when they are the types of activities more likely to be engaged in by city dwellers. I am kind of reluctant to discuss myself in this context, but here goes… every morning, I spend 30 minutes doing some rounds feeding a few colonies of feral cats. It doesn’t make me Mother Teresa, but I feel good doing it. I’m not sure what it costs me in cat food… some months when the budget is tighter, they only get kibble, other months they get to eat cans more frequently. I’ve come across a lot of other people who do the same.</p>
<p>I mention this for two reasons. As far as the government is concerned, most people who feed stray animals are not engaging in charity… there is no write-off occurring. Its way too much effort to go through the process of setting oneself up as a legitimate charity. (Yes, I know about organizations like Alley Cats and Feral Cat Alliance – those are great organizations, but they’re ways of sending money to other people who are doing their own charity work.) The second reason is that, and this is anecdotal, but it is my experience that city dwellers are more likely to be willing to work with animals than are those in rural areas. In the parts of South where I lived, spending time with animals doesn’t mean feeding feral cats or walking dogs at the shelter, it means shooting deer, and on occasion, bears.</p>
<p>(Two asides. Aside number 1 &#8211; I’m moving in a week, and I’ve found people to take over my route. Aside number 2 – anyone within driving distance of the LA area want a cat? My girlfriend and I found a big one living behind a dumpster that used to belong to someone – obvious signs were that she had been declawed and was more approachable than the ferals. We’ve got her at home now, all cleaned up, but we can’t find her owner and its been a few months. She’s about 4 years old, huge (16 solid pounds (i.e., not fat) when we pulled her off the street, larger now), very sweet, clumsy for a cat, and great with people – she will sleep with you in bed. Unfortunately she is very aggressive toward other cats (my girlfriend and I have 3 so we cannot keep her). Prove to me you’ll give her a good home and she’s yours. I mean the cat, not the girlfriend!)</p>
<p>There is a third error with these types of analyses. I remember reading studies that show that in general, people are more willing to pay taxes when a population is relatively homogenous. In other words, we don’t mind paying taxes if everyone else looks like us because we know then the money the government is taking away from us is not going to go to them. (Because, quite frankly, we don’t like them.) This matters because a) most religious conservatives live in rural areas with homogeneous populations and b) most Churches seem to be quite segregated – I’ve seen plenty of communities with a majority black Church and a majority white Church on the same street; thus, when Churchgoers fund their Church, they are funding “us” but not “them.”</p>
<p>So yes…. there is little doubt that the average conservative Church goer will engage in more charity than the average liberal Godless heathen.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/01/AR2006120101509.html">Eric Foner</a> briefly mentions the rankings of the greatest Presidents:<br />
<blockquote>Ever since 1948, when Harvard professor Arthur Schlesinger Sr. asked 55 historians to rank U.S. presidents on a scale from &#8220;great&#8221; to &#8220;failure,&#8221; such polls have been a favorite pastime for those of us who study the American past &#8230; More often, however, the rankings display a remarkable year-to-year uniformity. Abraham Lincoln, George Washington and Franklin D. Roosevelt always figure in the &#8220;great&#8221; category.</p></blockquote>
<p>But his main focus is on the failures.  Presidents are viewed as failures for various reasons:<br />
<blockquote>At a time of national crisis, Pierce and Buchanan, who served in the eight years preceding the Civil War, and Johnson, who followed it, were simply not up to the job. Stubborn, narrow-minded, unwilling to listen to criticism or to consider alternatives to disastrous mistakes, they surrounded themselves with sycophants and shaped their policies to appeal to retrogressive political forces &#8230; Harding and Coolidge are best remembered for the corruption of their years in office (1921-23 and 1923-29, respectively) and for channeling money and favors to big business. They slashed income and corporate taxes and supported employers&#8217; campaigns to eliminate unions. Members of their administrations received kickbacks and bribes from lobbyists and businessmen &#8230; Despite some notable accomplishments in domestic and foreign policy, Nixon is mostly associated today with disdain for the Constitution and abuse of presidential power. Obsessed with secrecy and media leaks, he viewed every critic as a threat to national security and illegally spied on U.S. citizens. Nixon considered himself above the law &#8230; But Polk should be remembered primarily for launching that unprovoked attack on Mexico and seizing one-third of its territory for the United States.  Lincoln, then a member of Congress from Illinois, condemned Polk for misleading Congress and the public about the cause of the war &#8211; an alleged Mexican incursion into the United States. Accepting the president&#8217;s right to attack another country &#8220;whenever he shall deem it necessary,&#8221; Lincoln observed, would make it impossible to &#8220;fix any limit&#8221; to his power to make war. Today, one wishes that the country had heeded Lincoln&#8217;s warning.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Foner’s point wasn’t to offer us a history lesson.  Rather he is outlining why he thinks George W. Bush is “The Worst Ever”.  Alas – we have to endure this for two more years.</p>

                                <p>So says <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/12/why_oh_why_cant.html">Brad DeLong</a> in regards what <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/02/business/02instincts.html?_r=2&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;oref=slogin">M. P. Dunleavey</a> wrote:<br />
<blockquote>I’ve often wondered what Social Security means to me, but never expected to read the following, rather astounding, explication: “Unless action is taken soon to strengthen Social Security, in just 11 years we will begin paying more in benefits than we collect in taxes,” the letter said. “Without changes, by 2040 the Social Security Trust Fund will be exhausted.” Exhausted? I’ve been fairly pessimistic about the future of Social Security and tend to side with those who recommend not counting on those benefits when calculating one’s retirement. But I thought the Social Security Administration itself might hold out more hope for its own future &#8211; let alone yours and mine. Evidently, it doesn’t.</p></blockquote>
<p>One would think with all the excellent discussions on the finances of the Social Security Trust Fund, Dunleavey would have more to say than to rehash the spin from the privatization crowd or better sources than Olivia S. Mitchell “who has served on the president’s Commission to Strengthen Social Security”.  Dunleavey and Mitchell claim all one has to do is add and subtract. But add and subtract what?  It seems there are aware of those Trust Fund reserves that will help fund Social Security benefits from 2017 to 2040, but then they drag out this canard:<br />
<blockquote>True, those I.O.U.’s are a promise to repay, “backed by the full faith of the U.S. government, so people are right to see them as secure,” Professor Mitchell added. “But the Treasury goes ahead and spends that money, so although there is a promise, nobody knows where the money will come from to pay them back.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess they believe that the Federal government MUST run General Fund deficits forever as if it were impossible to raise taxes.  As far as the Social Security system becoming exhausted as of 2040 – that’s simply not the case as long as we pay payroll taxes.  Of course, the real question is why are we paying payroll taxes?  Are they contributions to our future Social Security retirement benefits or just substitutes for taxes that would have been paid out of the incomes of the very well to do?  </p>
<p>I’m not sure about Brad’s claim that this is the worst article on this topic ever as it strikes me as a mere rehash of the incessant silliness on this topic we’ve heard for years.</p>

                                <p>I bet President Bush was a little ticked at his Defense Secretary when he was told the DAY BEFORE THE ELECTIONS that their strategy was <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/03/world/middleeast/03military.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">not working</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Two days before he resigned as defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld submitted a classified memo to the White House that acknowledged that the Bush administration’s strategy in Iraq as not working and called for a major course correction.  “In my view it is time for a major adjustment,” wrote Mr. Rumsfeld, who has been a symbol of a dogged stay-the-course policy. “Clearly, what U.S. forces are currently doing in Iraq is not working well enough or fast enough.”  Nor did Mr. Rumsfeld seem confident that the administration would readily develop an effective alternative. To limit the political fallout from shifting course, he suggested the administration consider a campaign to lower public expectations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the message from the GOP on November 6 was that we were winning and that we should stay the course.  Thank goodness the memo was classified so the voters didn’t have to know the truth.  Then again – the results of the election show the American people were not as stupid as this White House assumed.  </p>
<p>While their serial dishonesty has me too sick to even think about the various horrible options in this memo, we should be thankful that <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_12/010324.php">Kevin Drum</a> has the clarity of thought to address the policy implications.  Which is doubly amazing given that his team just blew their chance at the <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_12/010323.php">National Championship</a>.  Which means USC returns to Pasadena for the Rose Bowl.  Good luck Trojans!</p>

But a small part of me says&#8230; optimal market outcomes go away when you have externalities, crime, market power, or imperfect information.  Doesn&#8217;t misinformation and outright lying qualify as imperfect information?  </p>
<p>Why should the government try to stop crime, but put less effort into halting externalities and market power, and even less into reducing imperfect information?  (Or does it?)  Is there a way of ensuring that consumers aren&#8217;t deceived?  Is allowing consumers to be deceived a good thing?  Am I right &#8211; is this a really dumb idea by Harold Ford or is there something to it?  Your thoughts?</p>
<p>BTW&#8230; Benen has another <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/9223.html">interesting post</a>, today on goings on at the General Services Administration (GSA).</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The President helps set a tone.  One of the things the President might affect can be  seen in the values that people pass along to their children.  These values, in turn, can be seen by how children behave.</p>
<p>The table below shows the annual change in the % of 12th graders who report smoking cigarettes daily in the last 30 days, who reported drinking five or more alcoholic beverages in the previous 2 weeks, and who reported using illicit drugs in the last 30 days.  (Note… the data set I was able to find only goes back to 1980.)</p>
<p>________cigarette_____booze____drugs<br />Reagan____-2.0________-2.1_____-6.7<br />GHW_____-1.3________-5.3_____-9.3<br />Clinton____2.3_________0.9______7.1<br />GW______-8.0________-1.3______-1.5</p>
<p>(data runs through 2005)</p>
<p>The next table shows the annual change in the rate of serious violent crimes committed by youths age 12 to 17.</p>
<p>_______violent crimes<br />Reagan____-0.1<br />GHW______2.5<br />Clinton____-3.4<br />GW_______-0.9</p>
<p>(data runs through 2004)</p>
<p>Note… because the underlying data is in percentage terms, the changes shown are simply yearly averages.</p>
<p>So what is going on…  well, Clinton did best at cutting serious violent crimes by youths, but he was also the only President under whom nonviolent crime increased.  </p>
<p>What is going on?  Well, my theories:<br />1.  If the economy is doing very well, as it was under Clinton, young people can afford to buy drugs, alcohol, and booze.  They also might not feel frustrations that would lead to committing more violent crimes<br />2.  Reagan, GHW, and GW promoted tough guy images.  That might promote those with criminal tendencies to commit violent crimes.  (If video games will do it, why not Americans cheering planes bombing stuff on tv?)  On the other hand, Clinton, well, he “didn’t inhale.” That might inspire those with criminal tendencies to smoke pot, drink, or smoke.<br />3.  Killing, raping, and pillaging take effort, and are that much harder if you’re stoned.</p>
<p>A I missing any reasons?  Do you buy these reasons?  (I tend to lean two thirds toward option 1, and one third to option 2.)  Also… in discussing youth crimes… does anything else bear mentioning?</p>
<p>All data came from <a href="http://www.childstats.gov/americaschildren/tables.asp"> here</a>.</p>

<blockquote>With congressional Dems looking to take on the oil industry next year, the industry&#8217;s lead trade group, the American Petroleum Institute, is planning a $100 million PR &#8220;image and education effort</p></blockquote>
<p>In particular, the <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/11/30/D8LNLLBG0.html">Exxon CEO</a> argues:<br />
<blockquote>Proposals by congressional Democrats to eliminate oil industry tax breaks and subsidies would set a bad example overseas and discourage new industry investments, Exxon Mobil&#8217;s top executive said Thursday. Rex W. Tillerson said moves suggested by leaders of the incoming Democratic congressional majority would encourage similar steps by governments abroad, where Exxon Mobil Corp. generates the bulk of its profit. &#8220;I think the bigger concern I have is not so much the economic direct effect of the fact that they want to take a tax break off here or there. But it&#8217;s the message it sends the rest of the world that you don&#8217;t have to provide stable (regulatory) frameworks,&#8221; Tillerson told reporters after a speech to the Boston College Chief Executives&#8217; Club.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exxon does not want a stable tax regime – they want lower taxes for their industry.  Even it takes all sorts of gimmicks over time as they get their political friends into places of real authority (e.g., the White House).  I also find it funny that they are concerned that foreign tax laws might take the lead of American tax law given how the captains of Corporate America often ask U.S. tax law to follow the lead of foreign tax law – at least when foreign tax law affords them tax breaks.  </p>

Mark questions whether this committee was truly independent pointing us to an article by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/30/AR2006113001538.html">Carrie Johnson</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Investor groups sounded alarms yesterday after it emerged that a foundation with ties to a pair of well-heeled business donors and an executive battling civil charges had funded a controversial new report seeking to slash corporate regulation.  The Committee on Capital Markets Regulation, which argues that U.S. markets are suffering under overzealous enforcement and unwieldy rules, said it received $500,000 in financial support from the C.V. Starr Foundation &#8230; Barbara Roper, director of investor protection at the Consumer Federation of America, went even further, asserting that the capital markets group had preordained its conclusions and carefully selected statistics to make its case that more companies were listing their stocks on foreign markets because of burdensome U.S. rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>But even if one concedes that companies had to spend a lot of resources in the first couple of years under Sarbanes-Oxley – are these continuing costs or simply start-up costs?  It seems at least one of the <a href="http://www.sarbanes-oxley.be/AABS_404Perspectives_Issue2.pdf">Big Four</a> is attracting audit clients with promises of making the process more efficient over time.  I would presume the other accounting firms are acting similarly.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve had posts on attorneys before.  Regular readers may remember one question I asked&#8230; why is it acceptable to have a Secretary of the Energy who cannot define the word Energy, or a Secretary of Agriculture who doesn&#8217;t understand the first thing about mad cow disease, but its not OK to have, say, a Physicist on the Supreme Court?</p>
<p>Now, I am no scientist, but that question came to mind immediately when I read <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/intersection/2006/11/scalia_idiocy_continued.php"> this</a>.</p>
