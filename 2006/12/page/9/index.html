                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I mentioned one of my old Professors, Arnold Harberger, a few times in recent posts.  I can be argumentative, and I got into a lot of arguments with him.  As a general rule, when I argued with Harberger, I was wrong.  There is one thing, and one thing only that I can think of that I disagreed with him that to this day I still think I was right about.  So here’s that story…</p>
<p>When I finished my comps, I had a few rudimentary germs of ideas I was considering for thesis topics.  My favorite was a theory of economic development.  I had spent some time thinking about Mexico and Brazil and the United States – each was the flagship, so to speak, of a colonial power, but the first two are charitably described as developing countries, and the last, well, is the United States.  </p>
<p>I also thought about the period from World War 2 onward.  At the end of the war, much of the world was in pitiful shape.  There wasn’t much to differentiate, say, West Germany from East Germany, or Taiwan from China, or South Korea from North Korea, or England or France from Poland or Czechoslovakia.  And Mexico and Brazil were probably in better shape than most, if not all of those countries.  And yet, 50 years later there were definitely winners and losers among those countries.</p>
<p>So what was the difference?  Here’s what I thought…  the difference between Mexico and Brazil and the United States in the 1500s had nothing to do with Mexico, Brazil, and the US, but rather with Spain, Portugal, and England.  Spain and Portugal were dying empires, and they basically looted everything they could, often destorying much that they couldn&#8217;t loot in the process.  England was the most advanced country on earth; it didn’t need anything from the New World, and if anything, there was an outflow of capital (mostly human capital) from England to its colony.  </p>
<p>I also thought a bit about Mexico and Brazil and other countries: South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, West Germany, East Germany, Poland, England and China.  At the end of World War 2, arguably Mexico and Brazil were in better shape than the other countries I mentioned.  South Korea and Taiwan had never been particularly advanced; Japan and West Germany were in ruins.  And yet, 50 years later, Mexico and Brazil were lagging behind South Korea and Taiwan and Japan and West Germany.  Not so much East Germany and Poland.  </p>
<p>What’s the difference?  Well…  the winners were those that the United States effectively colonized.  (And if you don’t think we effectively colonized, say, England, bear in mind there are still US military bases there.  As to Taiwan, they were colonized twice – first, when the Nationalists took everything that wasn’t nailed down in China and much that was to Taiwan, and second, with US participation after Quemoy and Matsu.  South Korea, Japan, and the rest of Western Europe – I think colonization was self-evident.)  In other words, there was an inflow of human capital from the most advanced country on earth.  East Germany and Poland were effectively colonized by an empire that was already dying – there was more of a transfer of capital toward that empire (consider reports of Soviet soldiers stealing toilets from German apartment buildings) than the other way.</p>
<p>Now, what is magical about being colonized by whatever the most advanced country on earth?  Well…  I think it’s a few things.  I would imagine that when a country leads the world, it is generally because it has better institutions and a relative strong economic situation.  And the institutions, along with capital (human and otherwise) get transferred to the colonies.  All of that happened in England and South Korea and so forth, but it did not happen in Mexico or Brazil or Argentina.  (Some wag once called them the MBA countries.)</p>
<p>Note that I am not advocating colonization as a way of development.  (No “Mouse that Roared” scenario here.)  I believe the same effects could be accomplished by copying the institutions from countries that are successful and getting massive infusions of resources.</p>
<p>And yes, I note there are exceptions – places like Luxembourg and the Scandinavian countries – but these seem to have pretty good institutions of their own.  Other exceptions include countries where oil was discovered (but an argument could be made the US effectively colonized, if not Saudi Arabia, at least its economy), or one-off special cases; trading posts like Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>Anyway, Harberger thought this didn’t make sense, and wasn’t a good topic, so I scratched it off the list of thesis topics.  But it was one of the things about which he didn’t convince me.  And its been over a decade and I still think about this now and then, I still believe there’s something to this.  Your thoughts?  Am I missing something obvious?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Sometimes the data just shows what everyone expects it to show.  I don’t expect many people will be surprised by much in this post, which is on education.</p>
<p>55.5 percent of the US population aged 3 to 34 was enrolled in school in 1965; that figure was 56.2% in 2004, and it reached a low (for the sample) of 47.9% in 1984.  </p>
<p>We often hear that enrollment (especially in college and MBA programs) rises when the job market sucks.  An economist would say this because in a poor job market, the costs (in terms of foregone opportunity) of attending school drop.  Similarly, when the job market is poor, the benefits of attending school may also rise; the added degree may increase one’s likelihood of getting a job more when competition for jobs is extremely fierce than at other times.</p>
<p>But are there other instances in which the benefits of getting more education increase?  Well… yes.  For example, presumably the fewer the numbers of students per teacher, the better the education, on the average.  The table below shows the correlation between the percentage of the population (3 to 34) in school in any given year, and the ratio of students to teachers X years before</p>
<p>Ratio, X years before________correlation<br />1 year___________________-0.07<br />2 years__________________-0.19<br />3 years__________________-0.28<br />4 years__________________-0.34<br />5 years__________________-0.43</p>
<p>The more students per teacher, the lower the enrollment in later years.  (I probably should have gone back a few more years to see when the correlation stops mattering, but I got tired.  Sorry.)</p>
<p>Another measure of the quality of education might be teacher’s pay.  The next table shows the correlation between the percentage of the population (3 to 34) in school in any given year, and the ratio of students to teachers X years before</p>
<p>Ratio, X years before________correlation<br />1 year____________________0.56<br />2 years___________________0.65<br />3 years___________________0.75<br />4 years___________________0.81<br />5 years___________________0.84</p>
<p>The higher the teacher pay, the higher the enrollment in later years.</p>
<p>Conclusion…  on the average, students (or potential students) are rational.  When there are more signs that some of the proxies for education quality are increasing, it leads to greater enrollment in school, all else being equal.  </p>
<p>As always, if anyone wants my spreadsheet, just ask.  </p>

                                <p>Answer:  When it is a Social Security tax.</p>
<p>And there you have the central obfuscation of much of the conservative spin on tax burden and tax progressivity.  They focus on cutting only “income taxes” i.e. only those taxes collected collected by the <stockticker>IRS</stockticker> and paid into the Treasury.  They conveniently exclude another tax on income which is by far the larger of the two for much of the population – the Social Security or FICA tax.</p>
<p>If you are like most folks you don’t really pay much attention to the list of cryptic acronyms on your pay stub telling you which deduction went to which entity.  You just focus on the bottom line and wish that it were closer to the line named “gross pay”.  But this veil of ignorance hides a multitude of sins for those obsessed with tax cuts.   If the Social Security tax is the biggest tax paid by lower income workers and is not paid at all by those in the upper brackets then the increases in Social Security taxes over the past 20 years coupled with the decreases in “income tax” rates means that there has been a huge shift away from taxing rich people in favor of taxing poor ones.</p>
<p>All of this would be OK you might think if we eventually get the Social Security tax back in the form of a pension after we retire.  But if, as pgl has noted in the post just before this one – See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/great-wealth-transfer.html">here</a> &#8211; the government runs up so much debt today that they have no tax capacity left to redeem the SS Trust Fund’s bonds in the future, then the SS taxes really are just another income tax.
</p>
<p>Moral:  Any measure of tax burden, progressivity or regressivity that looks only at one of the two main taxes is probably not very accurate.
</p>
<p>Here are the basic facts about the rates:
</p>
<p>The Social Security tax (6.2% paid by workers and employers for a total of 12.4%) is paid mostly by lower income people and is only paid on the first $94,200 of income.  That is, Bill Gates pays the same SS tax as a middle class person earning only 94K.</p>
<p>The Federal Income Tax has several different brackets but maxes out at 35% at an income of about $336,000 while income up to $7550 ($15,000 for married couples) isnt taxed and income between $7,550 and $30,650 ($15,000 -61,000 for married couples)is taxed at 15% and $30,650 to $74,200 (61-123K for married couples) at 25%.  (See the <stockticker>IRS</stockticker> website <a href="http://www.irs.gov/formspubs/article/0,,id=150856,00.html">here</a> )</p>
<p>These rates mean that for most of those under the median household income of about $44K the Social Security tax is bigger than the income tax.  The reverse is true for those above the median.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/12699486/paul_krugman_on_the_great_wealth_transfer/print">Paul Krugman</a> does a really nice job of explaining why the current Adminstration’s policies are more Dooh Nibor (reverse Robin Hood) economics, but I think we need to have a couple of addendums.  Let’s start here:<br />
<blockquote>And while Bush&#8217;s tax cuts shaved only a few hundred dollars off the tax bills of most Americans, they saved the richest one percent more than $44,000 on average. In fact, once all of Bush&#8217;s tax cuts take effect, it is estimated that those with incomes of more than $200,000 a year &#8211; the richest five percent of the population &#8211; will pocket almost half of the money. Those who make less than $75,000 a year &#8211; eighty percent of America &#8211; will receive barely a quarter of the cuts. In the Bush era, economic inequality is on the rise.</p></blockquote>
<p>What tax cut?  Bush’s fiscal policies are only deferring taxes as his fiscal reign has increased government spending, not reduced it.  So in the future, someone will have to pay more in taxes not less.  But who?  George W. Bush tells us no one but we know that’s not true.  We have seen some conservatives, such as Greg Mankiw and Bruce Bartlett, admitting this fiscal reality.  Bruce wants a consumption tax, while Greg wants to tax gasoline.  Shifting away from taxing capital income towards taxing consumption in general or gasoline in particular also represents a wealth transfer.  </p>
<p>But we have another candidate for the “Great Wealth Transfer” if the Bush game plan is to so screw up the General Fund financing that we have to raid our future Social Security benefits.  We hear lots of conservative insisting that the Federal government can’t afford to pay those benefits in the future.  Well – that may be true if we refuse to tax rich people.  But then we have converted payroll contributions into employment taxes.  And this could be the greatest theft in history.  When George W. Bush says he’s given you your money back, the “you” are folks like Jeff Skilling but it’s not his money but the money of workers who were told they were putting payroll contributions into the Social Security Trust Fund.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A high level delegation led by the Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20061211/pl_nm/usa_china_paulson_dc">is off to <country-region st="on"><place st="on">China</place></country-region></a>  this week but it is far from clear that anything particularly useful will be accomplished.  Bashing Chinese exchange rate policy is a favorite passtime in the <country-region st="on"><place st="on">U.S.</place></country-region> but Paulson is unlikely to score any points on that front even if the Chinese agree to talk about it.  Since they have said clearly that this is “a sovereign issue” it would seem that talk is about as far as they are willing to go.</p>
<p>China has responded to pressure to allow the yuan to float by allowing an appreciation of about 5% since mid 2005 &#8211; but this hasn’t been big enough to do much to the bilateral deficit, reported as $202 billion last year and on course to be at least that big this year.  But there is reason to believe not only that a realignment of the exchange rate wouldn’t by itself cure our trade balance problems but also that eventually China’s own internal problems will slow down the growth of its export sector.
</p>
<p>On the question of the dollar/yuan exchange rate, it is  important to remember that the IMF’s typical advice to countries with balance of payments problems applies as much to the US as it does to anyone else – if you want to achieve external balance while maintaining some semblance of internal balance then you need to use BOTH exchange rate policy and tax/spending policy to achieve the twin goals.  (This is broadly true of any set of goals – you need as many policy levers as you have goals or you will only hit on a happy solution by highly improbable dumb luck).  It is because of this that the IMF typically advises governments to devalue their currency while at the same time cutting government spending (and/or raising taxes) as a fundamental basis for any stabilization plan.
</p>
<p>If the U.S. tried to rely solely on exchange rate policy (insisting on a Chinese appreciation is the same as a depreciation or devaluation for the US)  it might help to some extent but the fundamental problem would remain unaddressed:  If we continued to spend more than we produce as we have been doing for some years, then we will continue to run deficits on the current account and the only way to cure THAT problem is to either spend less or produce more.  To the extent that higher Chinese prices reduced our real income we might get some narrowing of the gap between income and spending and to the extent that higher Chinese prices shifted our demand to other countries’ exports we might see a narrowing of the bilateral gap, but to rely on the exchange rate alone to address the problem won’t achieve the goal of narrowing the trade gap while maintaining internal growth and stability.
</p>
<p>The same type of reasoning can be applied to <country-region st="on"><place st="on">China</place></country-region> itself and shows that there is another way to achieve the goal of reducing the competitiveness of Chinese exports.  The <country-region st="on">US</country-region> has been focused on raising the prices of our imports from <country-region st="on"><place st="on">China</place></country-region> through letting the yuan appreciate against the dollar.  Another way those prices could rise with a fixed exchange rate is if there is inflation inside <country-region st="on"><place st="on">China</place></country-region>.  So far, Chinese inflation (to the extent that we can believe the data in an economy with as many controls as <place st="on"><country-region st="on">China</country-region></place> has) remains in the low single digits.  </p>
<p>But there is reason to believe this can’t go on indefinitely if the economy continues to grow at a rate of 10% per year.  Sooner or later there will bottlenecks for skilled labor or other inputs that will raise costs for exporters.  Apparently, the Chinese authorities are trying to cool things down themselves, having engaged in contractionary bond sales in the past few weeks ( See  <a href="http://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/afx/2006/12/10/afx3243103.html">here</a>) and raising reserve requirements several times this year. (See  <a href="http://survivedsars.typepad.com/survivedsars/2006/11/reserve_require.html">here </a>  ) Whether this will work remains to be seen but even if it doesn’t the Chinese real exchange rate might eventually help out.</p>
<p>Bottom line?  Paulson may not achieve much but even if he did it wouldn&#8217;t make much difference.

                                <p><a href="http://www.clevelandfed.org/Research/index.cfm#topfive">David Altig</a> compares the Keynesian view of <a href="http://coffeehouse.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2006/dec/11/the_five_boxes_of_populist_economics">Max Sawicky</a> to the market clearing real business cycle view of <a href="http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users2&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB116579723019846033.html%3Fmod%3Dopinion_main_commentaries">Edward Prescott</a>.  David summarizes: <br />
<blockquote>So is [GDP below its potential] today, and can monetary policy do anything about it? Sawicky says yes, Prescott says no. What say I? Two-handed economist that I am, I may not go all the way to Prescott’s view—but I lean in that direction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prescott is arguing that the late 1990’s boom was a real business shock.  I’ll grant him that.  When Prescott writes the following, I have to disagree:<br />
<blockquote>What about busts? Let&#8217;s begin with the assumption that tight monetary policy caused the recession of 1978-1982. This myth is so firmly entrenched that I could have called this downturn the &#8220;Volcker recession&#8221; and readers would have understood my reference… But looking closer at the data we see that output began its downward trend in late 1979 while monetary policy was still easy through most of 1980. Also, output continued its decline through 1982, when it began to climb at a time when monetary policy remained tight. These facts do not square with conventional wisdom. Our obsession with monetary policy in the conduct of the real economy is misplaced.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh good grief.  There were four distinct periods of Volcker monetary policy: (1) his initial tight money, (2) his subsequent easing in 1980 which Prescott mentions, (3) round two of tight money when he got a load of Reagan’s fiscal stimulus, and (4) the easing of tight money after the damage known as the Reagan recession was done and could be reasonably assumed to bring inflation down.  Has Prescott ever heard of lags?  His case that money does not matter is specious at best (at worst, it seems suitable for the pages of the National Review). </p>
<p>David talks about economists with two hands.  Well, a two-handed economist understands that productivity shocks exists AND knows that Keynes had a point in his 1936 General Theory.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Early on in the settlement of Brazil, the king of Portugal, Dom Joao III, created a number of hereditary &#8220;captaincies&#8221; &#8211; enormous land grants the size of states today.  Needless to say, the captains who got these captaincies were extremely wealthy, well-connected individuals.  Also needless to say, someone who is given a property the size of, say, Oregon, isn&#8217;t going to care too much about developing that property.  That person&#8217;s major source of wealth is not developing property, its making nice to the king who can give him more property.  </p>
<p>Now, consider the captaincy.  In every single case, there were already people living there at the time the land was granted.  In many instances, natives (who would soon be virtually wiped out), but also European settlers.  Many were criminals or just the random dregs of society, while others were hoping to make a quick buck and go back to Europe wealthy.</p>
<p>Regardless, the vast majority of Brazilians were living on what, legally (assuming the Portuguese government had right to decide what was legal) living on land owned by others who had little interest in that land.  And its not like there was anyplace else to go&#8230; the Portuguese split of the lands under their domain, the Spanish did the same to the lands under their domain, ditto the Dutch, and whoever else was jostling around in South America.</p>
<p>So what do you do?  Well, say you, as a settler goes and builds something.  If it produces wealth, the landholder will express some interest.  So your incentive is either not to build anything, or build on the sly, in the boondocks.  If you get too big, too successful, someone else &#8211; the captain or his descendents, would simply take your stuff away.  (And those of you who are ready to argue that &#8211; &#8220;No, that&#8217;s irrational.  The captain&#8217;s best interests are served by encouraging small businessmen to create a thriving economy on his property&#8221; forget that doing that takes effort and foresight, but simply seizing provides a benefit here and now, especially to someone born of enough privilege.)  </p>
<p>So not much gets developed.  And this goes on for generations.</p>
<p>Eventually, the 1960s come around.  Outside of the cities, much of the country is poor and undeveloped.  Its still owned by a few large families for whom focusing on what&#8217;s going on in the boondocks or encouraging any economic development doesn&#8217;t pay off in the short run, so why bother?  Its still lived on by small farmers who are doing their best to stay under the radar of the captain&#8217;s descendents.</p>
<p>And yes, its Brazil, but its also Argentina, and just about every other country in the region.  And since its the 1960s, people in the region &#8211; at least the city dwellers &#8211; believe that their time has come.  This is Brazil&#8217;s (or Argentina&#8217;s or Chile&#8217;s or Uruguay&#8217;s) decade.  A populist who originates from a very wealthy family is President (again, this is Brazil, but it is also other South American countries) looks across the large, relatively prosperous cities, teeming with life and bustling with commerce, and he looks across the vast wasteland that is the backlands, and he says to himself&#8230; &#8220;The small property holders in the cities made these cities capitalist and prosperous.  But the big property owners who own the vast, vast tracts of land have made the rest of the country poor and backward.  Property rights are vastly important &#8211; without them, the cities would never have developed.  But the initial assignment of property rights in the hinterland was inefficient, and has led to waste.  Since property rights were assigned for random reasons in the first place, why not reset the clock, and start over?&#8221;</p>
<p>The populist President from a very wealthy family then gives a speech with the words &#8220;Land Reform.&#8221;  The other wealthy families talk to the generals.  One of the generals gives a speech:  &#8220;The military will not tolerate any hint of Marxism.&#8221;  The President isn&#8217;t concerned &#8211; after all, he isn&#8217;t a Marxist &#8211; he believes in property rights, small tradesman (a la Adam Smith), tariffs on imports, the infant industry argument, and the Virgin Mary.  These are also the things the general believes in.  Where they differ is that the President feels the original allocation of property rights was both wrong, and has hurt the country.  The general feels otherwise.  </p>
<p>And then one day the generals overthrow the President.  The new President is a general.  He gives a speech:  &#8220;The military will save the country from the Marxists.  No dissent will be tolerated.  The Marxists will be crushed, and then there will be elections.  Probably in six months.&#8221;</p>
<p>10 years pass, and there are no elections.  There are also no Marxists &#8211; Marxism is a stupid, stupid idea anyway, and most people weren&#8217;t stupid enough to fall for it.  But there are a lot of dead people who were labeled Marxists.  </p>
<p>At some point, eventually, the economy tanks under the military, which does share two penchants with real Marxists &#8211; they tolerate no dissent, and run a command economy.  And the people are unhappy.  And enough is enough.  And some of the people have little left to lose.  Their children had been taken away during the night, and have never come back.  </p>
<p>So they march.  Maybe they march in a circle in front of the Presidential palace, or they fill a square in a big city.  And the military has a choice &#8211; they can gun these people down, like they gunned down so many before, maintaining their economy like a Marxist totalitarian economy.  Or they can do nothing.  And because they are dispirited by now, they do nothing.</p>
<p>And so another politician from a very wealthy family steps forward.  He tells the people &#8211; &#8220;I really was in opposition this whole time.&#8221;   The marchers ally themselves with that politician.  He talks to the President &#8211; a general who was so dispirited, he had previously said, when asked how he wanted to be remembered:  &#8220;I want to be forgotten.&#8221;</p>
<p>And an agreement is reached.  There is one more military President, or perhaps there isn&#8217;t.  And then the politician, the one who supposedly had always been in opposition, becomes President.  After him, there are elections.  </p>
<p>And eventually&#8230;. the general, the one that originally overthrew a democratically elected President, dies.  And the Washington Post writes an editorial praising him, and praising the fact that the general, unlike the Marxists, really made a difference.  After all, just look at how the economy since the general left office.</p>

                                <p>Could Nancy Pelosi be listening to my pleas?  <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/002126.php">Eric Kleefeld</a> suggests she may be:<br />
<blockquote>“Democrats tidying up a cluster of unfinished spending bills dumped on them by departing Republican leaders in Congress will start by removing billions of dollars in lawmakers&#8217; pet projects next month. &#8220;The move, orchestrated by the incoming chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations committees, could prove politically savvy even as it proves unpopular with other members of Congress, who as a group will lose thousands of so-called earmarks. &#8220;&#8216;There will be no congressional earmarks,&#8217; Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., and Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said Monday in a statement announcing their plans, which were quickly endorsed by incoming Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and soon-to-be Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>This may be only a small start to fiscal sanity, but it will be at least a good first step.</p>

<p>Max Sawicky’s Five Boxes of Populist Economics</p>
<p>Over at TPM Café <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/blog/coffeehouse/2006/dec/11/the_five_boxes_of_populist_economics">Max Sawicky</a> cites five points of departure for populist economics:</p>
<p>1. Trade is most prominent, but it may be the least important of my top five. Measures to protect better-paying jobs in the U.S. are feasible but only promise results to a limited extent. <br />2. Deficit dementia. The dirty secret in economic policy is that most economists, radical, liberal, moderate, and conservative, understand that the Federal budget need never be balanced, that moderate deficits can be sustained indefinitely. The implications of tolerating deficits of two percent of GDP &#8212; over $200 billion in today&#8217;s terms &#8212; rather than a deficit of zero are huge. <br />3. Social Security. Forget &#8220;there is no crisis,&#8221; the clarion call of anti-Bush campaigners. The new slogan should be, there is no problem. No benefit cuts are necessary for the foreseeable future. If anything, there is a projected shortfall of income tax revenue required to repay debts to the Trust Fund, as per current law, as well as for maintaining other Federal programs. <br />4. Health care. There is no crisis. There is, rather, huge projected growth in demand for an ever-expanding menu of treatments, and the burden of managing efficient, ample, and fair public sector finance of this care. <br />5. The Imperial Fed. Our true economic overlords, the Federal Reserve Bank&#8217;s Board of Governors, have arrogated to themselves the right to ignore their mandate for full employment, elevating slow-growth anti-inflation policy over the unparalleled benefits of tight labor markets.<br />I think these are a fine place to start but I would certainly add a sixth:<br />6. The government can and should use tax and spending policies to engineer societal goals which market based solutions can’t or don’t achieve.<br />High on my list of these goals would be to engineer a more equitable distribution of income.  The social and economic costs of avoiding this issue are very high – our own past and the history of many other countries confirm that.  Another would be to engineer a better distribution of wealth, particularly human capital, by making sure that all schools were well funded and making college affordable for anyone who is smart and hard-working enough to get in.  I am certainly all in favor of using tax policy to engineer environmental goals (as is my Econ 101 textbook) but also political ones – e.g. if we had appropriate tax and research subsidies in place since the 1970’s we wouldn’t need a huge defense establishment to invade Middle Eastern oil exporting countries.  (Of course you could reasonably argue we don’t need it anyway but I am giving the conservatives the benefit of the doubt on that one.)  There are a whole list of other goals each of which could be debated but the general principle is one which has been derided by the right for years and should be unambiguously reaffirmed.<br />And as for Max’s number 2 I would be happy just to HAVE a fiscal policy in the sense of setting a goal for fiscal balance and implementing decisions to get us there.  As it is for the past six years we have had a “policy” which consisted of first cutting every tax that it was politically feasible to cut; second, cutting social spending and increasing corporate subsidies to the extent politically possible; third, borrow the difference from whoever would lend us the money (China, Saudi Arabia, etc. in addition to the usual domestic creditors).  This “policy” is simply the sum of each individual decision on taxing or spending and isn’t really a policy at all in the global sense.  <br />That is why Max’s number 5 has some added emphasis in my book – The Imperial Fed actually does have a policy – to the extent our government actually thinks about the future consequences of its actions they are the only game in town – So setting their goals in a socially beneficial way is very very important.  But let’s count our blessings.  Ben Bernanke may be closer to a “Germanic” central banker than I would like – but at least he is a competent person who has devoted his life to the study of monetary policy.  That is more than we can say about a lot of Bush’s appointments including some of the names that were floated for the Fed job before it went to Bernanke.</p>
