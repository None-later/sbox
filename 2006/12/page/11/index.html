                                <p>Steven Kyle really took me seriously when I offered to post stuff by Angry Bear readers.  M. Jed also had a write-up, as did Alex Gorski.  Where are the rest of you?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Steven Kyle&#8217;s latest.  I suspect some parts of this will look very familiar to those of you have had the opportunity to teach econ in the past few years:</p>
<p>Economic “Literacy” of Teenagers </p>
<p>I teach a large course in principles of economics  and often do informal surveys of student opinion to see what sort of notions they arrive with.  I guess I have two thoughts – one of them is to find out what the Future of Our Civilization will be like since these kids will be running the show when I am retired and the other is to find out what economic ideas are written on the tabula rasa of the 18 year old mind.  Most of them have no previous economics training and are largely telling me what they learned as conventional wisdom at dinner table conversations.  I think it is revealing of what their personal experience has been – Even the most aware don’t remember much before around 2000.  By far the majority of the students are not future Econ majors.  They take the course to fulfill core requirements for their majors but most aren’t going to go much further than Econ 102.</p>
<p>– Here is a not necessarily exhaustive list of some observations:</p>
<p>1.  They don’t see the problem with deficits or the national debt.  It hasn’t been a problem yet, it is boring and probably most important, they themselves live on credit cards and have happy lives so why shouldn’t the country?</p>
<p>2.  Inflation is a completely alien thought to them.  We economists are totally convinced of the importance of compound growth rates and what the price index has done over the past few decades but today’s college students (unless they are from Argentina or some other place where inflation is an issue) simply have no experience of it.  Prices haven’t gone up more than 2 or 3% a year in their lifetimes so they completely glaze over at being told how important it is to avoid it.</p>
<p>3.  They are convinced that Social Security is doomed and there is no way it will be there for them.  Many cite the much quoted factoid that the number of workers per retiree is declining.  Given these opinions they are mostly in favor of revamping the program since they see it as a tax with no future benefit.</p>
<p>4.  International trade is viewed with suspicion.  I can make them look at the labels on their clothes all day to demonstrate how important imports are to them and they will still worry about shipping jobs overseas and/or environmental issues.  Of course, since I teach them that international trade always has both winners and losers and truth lies in the data maybe I am at fault here.  Next time I do the course I think I will ask them if they would be willing to pay 5% more for their clothes if that meant more jobs here in the US.  I bet they would do it even if the sum total of the losses far outweighed the gains.</p>
<p>5.  There are no Luddites that I can find.  Technological change is taken for granted.  In fact, it is embraced fervently by all.  Today’s college students seem more interested in finding a job making new technologies than worrying about losing jobs because of it.</p>
<p>6.  Environmental awareness seems universal.  All are against pollution but there is no consensus on what to do about it and no real awareness of, or support for such economistic solutions as tradable permits.</p>
<p>So there you have it.  I suspect this is a fairly reasonable barometer of what opinion is among the population a whole or at least among those who are more or less aware but aren’t economists.  Comments?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The latest from the BLS can be found <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">here</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Nonfarm payroll employment rose by 132,000 in November, and the unemployment rate was essentially unchanged at 4.5 percent, the Bureau of Labor Statistics  of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  Job gains continued in several service-providing industries, including professional and business services, food services, and health care.  Employment declined in construction and manufacturing.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, some sectors suffered job losses but overall employment rose by a decent amount. The reported unemployment rate, which had declined from 4.6% in September to 4.4% in October inched back up to 4.5%.  This increase was not due to fall in the employment to population ratio, which stayed at 63.3% as the Household Survey recorded an increase of 277,000 (can’t wait for Lawrence Kudlow to tell us about all of those self-employed folks).  It seems the civilian labor force rose by 383,000 so the labor force participation rate rose from 66.2% to 66.3%.</p>
<p>On the wage front, nominal wages rose from $16.91 to $16.94 last month. Whether this modest increase will keep pace with the rise in consumer prices is not clear as the BLS will release the CPI later.  Speaking of which <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/08/business/08wage.html?ei=5094&#038;en=a06bab73a4abd4d6&#038;hp=&#038;ex=1165640400&#038;partner=homepage&#038;pagewanted=all">Jeremy Peters and David Leonhardt</a> write:<br />
<blockquote>After four years in which pay failed to keep pace with price increases, wages for most American workers have begun rising significantly faster than inflation &#8230; After years of stagnant, even declining real wages for the typical worker, the recent jump has also delivered a rare bit of good news for a White House coping with an unpopular war and the aftermath of the Democratic victory in the midterm elections &#8230; That question will begin to be answered today when the Labor Department releases its monthly employment report. Forecasters expect the pay gains — which began in earnest in September, when gas prices sank — to extend into November. But the economy has slowed significantly in recent months, and some analysts predict the housing slump will cause a further slowdown next year that will be a drag on incomes.  “The biggest issue is which direction the macroeconomy is headed,” said Jason Furman</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, Jeremy and David have written a good article.  So what got <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_12/010355.php">Kevin Drum</a> up on the wrong side of the bed so early on the West Coast:<br />
<blockquote>Boy, I sure hope the Fed doesn&#8217;t do anything to put the kibosh on this. Workers could use a break. But I&#8217;m sure Ben Bernanke realizes&#8230;.um, realizes that — what? He said what? &#8230; Ah yes. &#8220;Labor costs.&#8221; We can&#8217;t have those rising, can we? Not only does it get the workers all uppity, but it drains corporate treasuries and puts a crimp in CEO pay increases. That would be a disaster.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Chairman Ben thinks the labor market is overheated, I respectfully disagree.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/12/real_wages_are_rising_but_lets.html#014755">Dean Baker</a> objects to portions of the NYT article:<br />
<blockquote>The use of “significantly” in this sentence can be disputed. It is true that real wages have been rising rapidly in the last few months, but this is because of the plunge in gas prices, that was clearly a one-time event (as later acknowledged in the article). The reality is that nominal wages are rising in a neighborhood of 3.9 percent to 4.0 percent, while the underlying rate of inflation is in the range of 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent, translating into real wage growth of between 0.9 percent and 1.5 percent. This is a decent rate of real wage growth, but certainly not extraordinary. Average hourly wages grew at a real annual rate of 1.5 percent from the beginning of 1996 to 2000. From 1964 to 1973 real wage growth averaged more than 1.6 percent. So, the current rate of wage growth is respectable, but not extraordinary, especially following almost 5 years of wage stagnation. These points are noted in the article, but the article also features Ed Lazear, President Bush’s chief economist, saying that “the pay increases are huge, even relative to a period we think of as good.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone in the White House hyping the little morsels of good news?  Unheard of!  Deano also critiques Chairman Ben’s fear of rising wages.</p>

                                <p>I think just about everyone has come to a conclusion that things are not going well in Iraq.  Sure, there are <a href="http://tbogg.blogspot.com/2006/12/send-boy-to-camp-iraq-reporting-on.html">those</a> who still insist that in most of the country things are going well and who put the blame for the mess on everyone except those who actually have made any decisions about the war at all, but these are the cheerleaders who have just now realized that all is not hunky-dorry.</p>
<p>I think the problems in Iraq are evident to anyone who breaks things down into the ten year old level.</p>
<p>1.  A very bad person attacked the US<br />2.  The President ordered an attack on that very bad person who was hiding in Afghanistan<br />3.  Instead of finally finishing the bad guy off in Afghanistan, the President ordered an attack on another very bad guy who happened to be an enemy of the very bad guy who attacked the US<br />4.  The President treats other bad guys as his <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&#038;q=bush+abdullah">friends</a>.<br />5.  The other bad guys want us dead and are <a href="http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/our-friends-saudis.html">funding the bad guy with whom we&#8217;re fighting now</a>. </p>
<p>Now, does this sound like a credible story to a anyone?</p>
<p>Correction:  Restated point #5&#8230;<br />Correcton 2:  Removed duplicate words from point #3 pointed out by M1EK.</p>
<p>Update:  Two questions:  What could possibly be the motivation of a person who behaves as described above?  What could possibly be the motivation of people who cheerlead such behavior?</p>

                                <p>Assume there&#8217;s some dude out there who enjoys target shooting.  Let&#8217;s further assume that one fine afternoon, he decides to shoot targets in his back yard, and he happens to live in the suburbs.  Alarmed neighbors ask him to stop.  He responds that he has the right to do whatever he wants in his own backyard.  He continues firing, and at some point in the afternoon injures one of the neighborhood children, who happens to be cowering in his bedroom.  I would presume that at that point, if not before, the police show up, and if they didn&#8217;t the neighbors would have had the right to take steps, even violent steps on the man&#8217;s own property, to make him stop.  This would be especially true if the guy decided to start again the next day.</p>
<p>I was thinking about that when I read <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/9273.html">this post</a> by  Steve Benen.  The post discusses the fact that the EPA is currently considering relaxing clear air standards.  And I was wondering&#8230; what is the difference between, say, the crazy man target practicing, and a factory owner spewing toxins into the air or water?  </p>
<p>Well, I see a lot of similarities.  In both cases, you have a private property issue&#8230; presumably, people can do whatever they want on their property.  Of course, they don&#8217;t have the right to do what they want on someone else&#8217;s property, and neither a bullet nor airborne lead particulates seem to respect property lines.  In neither case is there necessarilly any intent to harm third parties, but in both cases, there is actual harm.  The main difference, from what I can tell (and I am no attorney), is that if someone aims a rifle in the direction of a four year old, you are legally allowed to shoot him before he pulls the trigger.  But when someone releases toxins that will harm a schoolyard full of children, and they do it day after day after day, well, that&#8217;s free enterprise.   (And the EPA is considering making that an even better thing.)  Am I missing something?</p>

                                <p>Here’s another post by Steven Kyle… I apologize to him and the readers in advance – I botched his table.  One of these years I have to learn how to post pictures….</p>
<p>Oil at $40???<br />It has been reported recently that one option being bandied about to counter the growing influence of Iran is a plan to “make the price of oil plummet” to $40 a barrel.  (See Steve Clemons’ report <a href="http://www.thewashingtonnote.com/archives/001815.php">here</a>) There are two questions that arise from this.<br />1. Can they do it?<br />2. Would it work?<br />In answer to the first question, it is instructive to look at the current OPEC oil production capacities since the key player in achieving an oil price crash would be Saudi Arabia which would have to produce at maximum capacity until the price came down from its current level of a bit over $60.  The table below, from the US Energy Information Administration (<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/steo/pub/3atab.html">here</a>) has the basic information.  The table shows Saudi excess capacity of around 1.5 mbd, or about 5% of current OPEC total production.  We know from various econometric studies that the short term demand for oil is highly inelastic (See e.g  <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/opecrv/v27y2003i1p1-8.html">here</a>) so in theory it is possible, at least for a while, but one question is whether some other country could “undo” the Saudi move by decreasing their own production.  Certainly Iran itself could do so by cutting their own production – in fact, they would be in a situation where the money they would lose by doing that would be not drastically different from the amount they would lose from a price decrease to $40.<br />Table 3a.  OPEC Oil Production<br />                       (Thousand Barrels Per Day)<br />(Energy Information Administration\Short-Term Energy Outlook &#8212; November 2006)</p>
<p>Member_Production__Capacity_Surplus Capacity<br />Algeria ______1430___1430______0<br />Indonesia_____890____890______0<br />Iran_________3750___3750______0<br />Kuwait_______2600___2600______0<br />Libya________1700___1700______0<br />Nigeria_______2300___2300______0<br />Qatar________726____726______0<br />Saudi Arabia__9200_10500-11500_1300-1800<br />UAE________2600____2600______0<br />Venezuela___2450____2450______0<br />Iraq*_______1900____1900______0<br />So the real problem isn’t necessarily the purely economic question of supply and demand elasticities.   A plan to manipulate the oil market would require everyone else active in the market (oil companies, other OPEC countries, etc.) to go along and it is far from obvious that they would.  Not only do the oil companies have an obvious interest in keeping the price up but so do all other oil producers.  While their record of restraint in honor of collusive behavior is not very impressive in the past, it is also important to note that the need for restraint would only be temporary – nobody imagines that the Saudis would want a permanently lower oil price.  In fact, it isn’t obvious that they would go along even in the short run.  <br />From the demand side, though short term elasticities are very low, the same cannot be said of the long term.  Not only do importing countries adjust to oil prices, but as their economies grow their demand shifts continuously outward over time.  This is a factor contributing to the  “peak oil” debate over the past few years.  Cheap oil would mean a reduced effort to conserve and increased growth for major importers as the positive shock of lower import prices filtered through their economies.  This would cause upward pressures on the oil price as soon as the Saudi induced slack was worked out.<br />As it happens, we have recent evidence on the effect of a 1.5 mbd shock in world oil markets, though in the opposite direction – When hurricane Katrina hit there was a loss of about that size to the world market but oil prices went up only $10.  While there is obviously a difference between a cut of that size and an equal increase, we have to be suspicious of claims that an increase of $1.5 mbd could generate a price drop twice as large as a decrease of the same magnitude.  All of these considerations mean that the answer to the first question even looking only at the supply side has to be “almost certainly not” and once we look at the demand side “definitely not”.<br />As to the second question,  whether an oil price crash would “work” to rein in the Iranians, the numbers certainly look big but the real issue is non-economic.  There is no question Iran would suffer from a financial hit as large as 40% of their oil income which is currently somewhere in the range of $50 billion a year.   (See <a href="http://www.house.gov/jec/studies/rr109-31.pdf">here</a> for a summary of Iran’s oil reserves and production) This is a loss on the order of 5% of GDP if one uses PPP values for GDP, but as much as 15-20% at the official exchange rate –  painful in aggregate terms but much more so for the government which is 90% dependent on oil revenue.  So the government would lose something like 40% of its revenue – Clearly a hardship but would it bring the government down?  The Iranian theocrats don’t seem ready to go anywhere and seem in fact to be strengthened every time the US makes another move against them.  And with a foreign exchange reserve fund of around $15 billion (See <a href="http://www.payvand.com/news/06/jan/1027.html">here</a>) they have room to maneuver.<br />So the bottom line is that the US State Department needs to get down to doing its job – talking to other countries to persuade them to do what we would like them to do – rather than engaging in pie in the sky searches for silver bullets to make other countries knuckle under through use of brute force, either military or economic.  <br />Besides, it isn’t too hard to imagine a scenario that would give us temporarily lower oil prices even without grand politico-economic manipulations.  If we get an increase in supply from the surge in oil drilling sparked by the price rises over the past  two years,  a recession in the OECD could well give us a drop in oil prices into the forties without any other actions taken.  But this is unlikely to be anything more than a temporary phenomenon – the long term trend seems clearly to be up and as I was told many times during my previous incarnation as a bond trader “the trend is your friend”.</p>

<p>The atrocities described in my earlier post were all committed in the name of anti-communism.  And yet, elsewhere in the world, especially in Asia, there were (and still are) thuggish regimes that are communist.   My theory is that these ideologies are just an excuse.  From what I can tell, the Chinese Communist Party is definitely not Communist now, if it ever was.  Sure, they mumbled the right words (if you were a communist sympathizer), but they were in the business of filling the role of supreme Emperor.  </p>
<p>Similarly, Bordaberry and Videla didn&#8217;t exactly believe in the free market.  Importing electronic equipment into most South American countries was a no-no (except, of course, for those with the right connections).  Pinochet may have done a lot of the right things from the point of view of many who call themselves capitalist, but on most of these capitalist experiments, the military and the state (think Social Security, or the sources of information, or, if I recall correctly (perhaps I&#8217;m wrong here), even the copper mines remained state owned).  </p>
<p>Am I right &#8211; are all these regimes &#8211; those calling themselves communist and those calling themselves anti-communist, just the same thing:  a group of verminous thugs clinging to power?  Why have so-called communists been successful at taking over countries in Asia, and so-called anti-communists been successful at taking over countries in Latin America?  Is it just proximity to the US and the former USSR or is there something else there?</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m too lazy to go looking for a link right now, but I recall that Uruguay, under the military dictatorship, was believed to be the country with the highest percentage of its population declared political prisoners in the world.  I vaguely recall seeing statisics (and I&#8217;m too lazy to look &#8217;em up right now so these numbers may not be right &#8211; don&#8217;t quote me!!!) that at one point, during the dictatorship, one out of 56 Uruguayan citizens had been locked up at one point in their lives for political reasons.  In Argentina, tens of thousands of people disappeared during the &#8220;dirty war&#8221; &#8211; many of them simply pushed out (while alive) of helicopters manacled an hour&#8217;s flight or so from the shore.  In Paraguay, Stroessner reputedly used former Gestapo thugs in his security apparatus.  As to Chile, most people who know little else, know the name Pinochet.  </p>
<p>Brazil&#8217;s military regime was considerably less thuggish than the above-mentioned countries.  And yet, you can get on a city bus in Asuncion or Santiago or Buenos Aires or Montevideo with an armful of valuables, and you will have that same armful of valuables when you get off.  You can&#8217;t do that in most major city in Brazil &#8211; not Sao Paulo or in Rio.  (You can do it in some second tier cities like Belo Horizonte &#8211; a few years ago I actually took a bus back from a client&#8217;s office.)  Why did Brazil have so much less violence from its dictatorship than the other big countries in the Southern half of South America, and why is it so much more prone to street violence now?</p>

                                <p>Continuing the policy of posting material by Angry Bear readers, this post on minimum wage policy is by Alex Gorski.</p>
<p> The conventional Econ101 approach to the minimum wage, although archaic, is at least well understood and therefore easily used in policy debate. Conservatives use Econ101 to create a zero-sum game – one where marginal benefits to minimum wage earners are canceled by the job loss of other minimum wage earners, often as a disguise for their pro-business stance. Liberals, on the other hand, prefer to discredit Econ101 as they see minimum wage growth as a poverty-fighting tool and not a matter of economic efficiency. The problem highlighted by <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_12/010328.php"> Kevin Drum</a> is that there is evidence on both sides of the minimum wage debate. Usually, if there is evidence on both sides, then there is an answer somewhere in the middle – and if we can find that answer then it will be possible to set policy accordingly.</p>
<p> Many domestic studies find little evidence supporting the classic Econ101 employment reduction. </p>
<p>There is no evidence of job loss from the last minimum wage increase. <br /><a href="http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/issueguides_minwage_minwagefacts">There is no evidence of job loss from the last minimum wage increase.</a></p>
<p>•  A 1998 EPI study failed to find any systematic, significant job loss associated with the 1996-97 minimum wage increase. In fact, following the most recent increase in the minimum wage in 1996-97, the low-wage labor market performed better than it had in decades (e.g., lower unemployment rates, increased average hourly wages, increased family income, decreased poverty rates).</p>
<p>•  Studies of the 1990-91 federal minimum wage increase, as well as studies by David Card and Alan Krueger of several state minimum wage increases, also found no measurable negative impact on employment.</p>
<p>•  New economic models that look specifically at low-wage labor markets help explain why there is little evidence of job loss associated with minimum wage increases. These models recognize that employers may be able to absorb some of the costs of a wage increase through higher productivity, lower recruiting and training costs, decreased absenteeism, and increased worker morale.</p>
<p>•    A recent Fiscal Policy Institute (FPI) study of state minimum wages found no evidence of negative employment effects on small businesses.</p>
<p> Context: The United States boasts the lowest industrialized minimum/average wage ratio at 31% [MAW Ratio]. Consequently, only <a href="http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/issueguides_minwage_minwagefacts">5%</a><br /> of the US workforce earn below 7.25$ per hour, with only <a href="http://epp.eurostat.cec.eu.int/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/PGP_PRD_CAT_PREREL/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2006/PGE_CAT_PREREL_YEAR_2006_MONTH_07/3-13072006-EN-AP2.PDF">1.4%</a> earning minimum wage. </p>
<p> With so few workers earning minimum wage, the cost of marginal increases is minimal which can explain why employers have absorbed previous increases without employment reductions. So let’s raise the minimum wage marginally from 5.15$ to 5.25$! Anyone get fired? NO? Let’s raise it from 5.25$ to 5.35$! Anyone get fired? You get the point – we can raise the minimum wage for a while before employers would react with employment reduction. But Econ101 is out there somewhere. Continue to raise the minimum wage in increments of .10$ and eventually there will be an employment reduction, slow at first but with gradual acceleration. When will that happen? I have no idea, nor does anyone else. </p>
<p> The redeeming aspect of the record low [31%] MAW ratio in the United States is the opportunity it presents to solve the minimum wage debate once and for all. Instead of foolish conventional policy, increasing the Federal minimum wage to a nominal figure [<a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/politics/4378157.html">7.25$ has been proposed</a>], the US could use a strategy of measured increases based on the MAW ratio. The MAW ratio is at <a href="http://www.epinet.org/content.cfm/issueguides_minwage_minwagefacts">31% [5.15/16.60]</a> – why not increase it by 2% each year and measure the employment reduction effects? [ceteris paribus of course]</p>
<p>A possible strategy:</p>
<p>(Note from cactus&#8230;  Unfortunately, I still don&#8217;t know how to post tables&#8230; my apologies to Alex Gorski here, but&#8230; the first column is year, the second column is Average Wage (3% growth), the third column is MAW ratio, and the fourth is the minimum wage.)</p>
<p>Year____Av Wage__MAW____Min Wage<br />2006____16.60____31%____5.15<br />2007____17.10____33%____5.64<br />2008____17.61____35%____6.16<br />2009____18.14____37%____6.71<br />2010____18.68____39%____7.29<br />2011____19.24____41%____7.89<br />2012____19.82____42%____8.32</p>
<p>As the aforementioned studies suggest, initially we will not see employment reductions. Eventually, Econ101 says we will begin to observe small employment reductions, at which point the MAW should be increased at a more measured pace.  The optimal MAW ratio will be reached when the minimum wage has been increased to the point where further increases will result in unwanted employment reduction. The minimum wage would then be indexed to the optimal MAW ratio so that it grows at the same pace as <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/bp177">overall wage growth</a>.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://timworstall.typepad.com/timworstall/2006/12/leftoid_economi.html#comment-26226780">Tim Worstall</a> argues:<br />
<blockquote>Now I assume that the argument over inequality is really about how much people have, yes? So it&#8217;s consumption inequality, if anything, that we should be worrying about &#8230; So, in attacking a Fox News guy Judd makes a schoolboy howler. He doesn&#8217;t even get the name of the chart right, which is The ratio of the wealthiest 1% to median wealth in the United States. Repeat after me. Wealth is a stock, income a flow. Leftoid economics, don&#8217;tcha just love it?</p></blockquote>
<p>Tim – you are right that Judd made a bit of an error here but income inequality has increased.  While it is true that measured consumption inequality has not increased as dramatically, if you follow my links in the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/income-inequality-cavuto-calls-krugman.html">post you referred to</a>, you’d see why I disagree with your premise that it is measured consumption inequality that we should refer to.</p>
<p>But I also owe Movie Guy – who had an excellent comment over at <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/12/krugman_versus_.html">Mark Thoma’s blog</a>, a little evidence (beyond those papers that Tim should go read). In 1974, the Gini coefficient was 0.395.  By 2005, it had increased to 0.469.  Now perhaps Mr. Cavuto has no idea what the Gini coefficient means, so let’s also report the shares of income of the highest quintile and the lowest quintile.  In 1974, the lowest quintile of the population received 4.3% of the nation’s income.  In 2005, their share was only 3.4%.  In 1974, the highest quintile of the population received 43.5% of the nation’s income.  In 2005, their share was 50.4%.  Now if Neil wishes to check this or find other fun facts, he can check with the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/income05.html">Census Bureau</a>.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;ve mentioned before that I&#8217;m moving this coming weekend, from the Valley to Silver Lake in Los Angeles.  I&#8217;ve also mentioned that every morning, I head out and feed feral cats that live in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>On my way back, I stop at Starbucks.  Though (perhaps because?) I grew up in South America, I don&#8217;t drink coffee.  My girlfriend, though, is addicted.  She orders (or when I go, I order) something called an iced opio.  If you put in the milk yourself at the little self-service island, its basically the same drink as an iced latte, but half the price.</p>
<p>Now, there are four Starbucks stores within two blocks of my apartment, if you count the mini-Starbucks (Joe&#8217;s or whatever its called) in the Barnes and Noble, and the other mini-Starbucks in the Marriott on Topanga Boulevard.  Sadly (?), where I will be in Silver Lake, there are none within a few miles.  This is important because my girlfriend is addicted not to coffee, but to Starbucks coffee.  Now, I&#8217;m not a coffee drinker, but I&#8217;ve heard sniping from some quarters at the quality of Starbucks coffee.  Perhaps its sour grapes.  I can&#8217;t hazard a guess.  I&#8217;ve also heard sniping at the price of Starbucks coffee, and yet there is often quite a line coming out of their stores.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s my question&#8230; can anyone explain to a non-coffee drinker what makes Starbucks so popular?</p>
