<p>It seems that there is some evidence that many oil and gas mining companies may not be paying the royalties they owe when drilling on government land.  Put another way, if this is true, they&#8217;re stealing from you and me.  </p>
<p>Show of hands &#8211; who is surprised?</p>

                                <p>One of the benefits of having new writers or guest writers is that they bring a different perspective.  Sometimes a completely different style.  The post that follows is from reader <a href="http://www.kyle.aem.cornell.edu/">Steven Kyle</a>.</p>
<p>Crystal Ball Special<br />Once a year I put my money where my mouth is and predict what the economy is going to do over the coming year.  Economists’ predictions tend to be about as accurate as a fourth grader with a ruler and some graph paper would be, but if we are worth anything to society we should be willing to say what we think about the actual economy we have and be graded on it occasionally.  I have done this for several years and while last year’s predictions were spot on, there have been some notable mistakes in the past.  So here goes – Mark this down and either praise me or point and laugh a year from now.<br />From the vantage point of early December 2006 it looks like we are now past the peak of the business cycle that began some five years ago. The Fed campaign of tightening is probably at an end (market expectations are for a rate decrease in March) and while the Democratic takeover of Congress has improved the long run fiscal outlook (those recent tax cuts will likely be allowed to expire by 2010 rather than being made permanent as the President wants) the near term outlook is still for huge deficits.<br />The housing market was the engine of the expansion over the past few years and the end of the housing boom is what is causing the turnaround in the overall business cycle. Various pieces of evidence point to a peak in housing earlier in 2006 and we are now left to hope that the air goes out of the bubble slowly rather than all at once. Either way, with house price appreciation slowing (or even going negative) and household debt service ratios at record highs there is little scope for consumer spending to prolong the economic expansion.<br />The European area is continuing to undergo a tightening cycle in monetary policy so there is little help to be expected from that direction, while the Chinese economy continues to grow at very high rates. This can&#8217;t go on forever but there is no particular reason to name a date when it will end. The big danger is that the Chinese central bank will decide to stop buying US government debt which would cause a drop in the value of the dollar. With dollar holdings already in the vicinity of $650-700 billion they could decide to expand in other directions. This would be significant for the US economy, providing additional downward pressure on the already weak US Dollar (now at 1.33 to the Euro) and upward pressure on interest rates.<br />Major caveats – Anybody in the Middle East with a grudge and a hand grenade has the potential ability to drastically affect oil prices.  Anybody who would be willing to predict that the Chinese will lose their appetite for endless reserve accumulation this year should be willing to issue drastic warnings, but having done so in the past I now refuse to try to mind read the Chinese monetary authorities.<br />Predictions for the coming year are: GDP growth around 2% (lower if there is a major political or economic shock) inflation continuing around 3% and interest rates likely to come down (at least at the short end) gradually through the year to 4.25% (Fed Funds).  The US dollar will likely be seen lower than it now is but where it will end the year is harder to say (though I am betting on it being lower in my personal portfolio).  But in the interest of not trying to wiggle out of making a prediction I will step up and say 1.45 to the euro a year from now.<br />Got your own predictions?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/12/05/cavuto-krugman">Judd</a> of Think Progress watched Neil Cavuto so we don’t have to:<br />
<blockquote>Krugman’s article is about how income inequality is getting worse and, as a result, even though some aggregate economic indicators are positive, most people aren’t benefiting. Cavuto told Krugman, “Here’s what I’m saying that you’re doing: You are lying to people.” Cavuto claims that income inequality isn’t “dramatically worse now than 10 years ago, 20 years ago.”</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, Cavuto is just another Faux New loud mouth idiot but Judd goofed here:<br />
<blockquote>Actually, Krugman is completely right: things are dramatically worse now than 10 or 20 years ago. Here’s a chart from the Economic Policy Institute that tracks the ratio of the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans to median income in the United States</p></blockquote>
<p>Judd is pointing out a measure of wealth inequality, which is not the same thing as income inequality.  So I went back to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/08/does-income-inequality-lead-to.html">this post</a>, which was contrasting the rise in consumption inequality to the rise in income inequality:<br />
<blockquote>Iacoviello’s model predicts that consumption inequality grows less than proportionally as income inequality grows, while wealth inequality grows more than proportionally.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rise in wealth inequality has been greater than the rise in income inequality, but the evidence is clear.  Paul Krugman was right and if Faux News were a real news outfit, they would have fired Neil Cavuto a long time ago.  Then again – I can’t think of many Faux News folks who would have been kept by a real news organization.</p>

                                <p>&#8220;A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&#8221;</p>
<p>On the comment thread to a recent post, I made a note that the Courts essentially interpret laws any way they choose.  The point was disputed by folks with a better legal understanding than I.</p>
<p>But let me try to expan on that.  Consider the second amendment.  (Why not be as controversial as possible?)</p>
<p>We all know precisely what the Founding Fathers had in mind when they wrote it.  The goal was for the country to have citizen soldiers that could repel invasions by foreign powers.  But&#8230; at least since the evil Canadians burned down the White House, its apparent to one and all that a citizen militia is unlikely to be the force that can keep them damn foreigners at bay.  </p>
<p>But these citizen militias have no chance, none, against the Canadian hordes without proper weaponry.  I&#8217;m talking assault helicopters, main battle tanks, fighter planes, reconnaissance aircraft, the works.  But the average Joe is not allowed not allowed to own these items.  Or, for that matter, fuel air bombs, surface to air missiles, or nuclear weapons.  Not even belt fed machine guns.  (I would guess that most Americans, myself included, are quite happy that their neighbors are not allowed to own such items.)  But the Founding Fathers never said:  &#8220;Its all well good for the People to own hunting knives and pistols, but not muskets.&#8221;</p>
<p>Which means&#8230; either the Courts &#8211; and that would include our boys Scalia and Thomas &#8211; are purposely violating the letter of the Constitution (something about the right to bear Arms) and the intent of the Founding Fathers.  Which means that they are interpreting things any way they choose.  And if this is true of the Constitution, how is it not going to be untrue of lesser issues?  Now, I&#8217;m not saying its a good thing or a bad thing&#8230; I am merely saying that its hard to take seriously anyone who claims to be a strict originalist or whatever the term happens to be, unless they support my right to own <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/015945.php">this</a>, but that anyone who does support that &#8220;right&#8221; is out of his or her mind.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Duncan Black is a “recovering” economist and he weighs in on the minimum wage debate in a post entitled <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_12_03_atrios_archive.html#116525506835108392">Monopsony</a>: <br />
<blockquote>unless you believe that the labor market is accurately characterized as perfectly competitive then not only is it the case that the minimum wage doesn&#8217;t necessarily, reduce employment, it&#8217;s actually quite possible that small increases in the minimum wage will increase it. To the extent that firms have market power, and there&#8217;s plenty of reason do think they do, the impact of small minimum wage increases can potentially be either &#8220;paradoxically&#8221; to increase employment or to just basically be a wash … The real point is that if the minimum wage has small or negligible employment effects, and there is both theoretical and empirical support for this idea, then it&#8217;s a pretty effective and inexpensive poverty reduction program. Obviously if poverty reduction programs for poor people interest you less than, say, poverty reduction programs for oil executives then you don&#8217;t much care about that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Duncan also recommends <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7522.html">Monopsony in Motion: Imperfect Competition in Labor Markets</a> by Alan Manning:<br />
<blockquote>Much of labor economics is built on the assumption that all the workers will quit immediately. Here, Alan Manning mounts a systematic challenge to the standard model of perfect competition. Monopsony in Motion stands apart by analyzing labor markets from the real-world perspective that employers have significant market (or monopsony) power over their workers. Arguing that this power derives from frictions in the labor market that make it time-consuming and costly for workers to change jobs, Manning re-examines much of labor economics based on this alternative and equally plausible assumption. The book addresses the theoretical implications of monopsony and presents a wealth of empirical evidence.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The other day I had a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/liberals-conservatives-charity-and.html">post</a> about a book on charitable giving and people’s political &#038; religious affiliations.  I was actually fairly late to the party… some big hitters like <a href="http://powerlineblog.com/archives/015945.php">Powerline</a> and <a href="http://www.drudge.com/news/87659/study-cons-more-charitable-than-libs">Drudge</a> commented on it approvingly.  I was actually thinking of that post when I wrote this one; perhaps Powerline and Drudge and the like will be as approving of this post as they were of Brook’s book on charity, especially since I think (in all modesty) that this analysis is a bit more solid in the data department.  </p>
<p>Y’all might recall I’ve had posts on abortions and unwed motherhood, as well as youth violence.  This one is on sexually transmitted diseases.  Before I post changes over time, here’s the part that the Powerlines and the Drudges might be interested in… I found data for 2004 incidences of <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/tables/table24.htm">syphillis</a>, <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/tables/table12.htm">gonorrhea</a> and <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/tables/table2.htm">chlamydia</a>, by state.  So it’s a simple matter to compare those to, say, how <a href="http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe2004/appendix.pdf">each state voted in the 2004 elections</a>.</p>
<p>The table below shows the median rate (per 100,000) of each STD in states that cast more than 50% of their votes for GW, the median in states that cast less than 50% of their votes for GW, and the median rate of each STD in all states.</p>
<p>GW&#8217;s Pct of votes______gonorrhea___syphillis___chlamydia<br />> 50% of votes____110.20______1.60_______298.50<br />Overall median_____89.15______1.60_______299.65</p>
<p>The table below shows the average rate (again, per 100,000) of each STD in states that cast more than 50% of their votes for GW, the average in states that cast less than 50% of their votes for GW, and the average rate of each STD in all states.</p>
<p>GW&#8217;s Pct of votes______gonorrhea___syphillis___chlamydia<br />> 50% of votes____110.72______1.95_______322.58<br />Overall average____96.86______1.91_______311.10</p>
<p>I just don’t have enough of a sense of humor to do justice to these figures.  Suffice it to say, states that voted for GW show higher average and median incidences of gonorrhea and syphilis, and a higher average incidence of chlamydia, than states that voted against him.  Presumably, the states that voted for GW also lean conservative.</p>
<p>In case you’re interested, I also looked at how incidences of these diseases <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/std/stats/tables/table1.htm">changed over time</a>.</p>
<p>Note that Chlamydia figures begin in 1984.  Also, I was able to find <a href="ftp://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Publications/Health_US/hus05tables/Table042.xls">deaths from AIDS</a>, but AIDS figures only run through 2003.  <br />Annual percentage change in incidence rate per 100,000 (syphilis, Chlamydia, gonorrhea) and death rate per 100,000 (AIDS)</p>
<p>______Syphilis __Chlamydia__Gonorrhea___ AIDS<br />Ike_____-5.72%______NA______-1.25%______NA<br />JFK____-1.08%______NA_______0.86%______NA<br />LBJ____-6.03%______NA_______9.58%______NA<br />Nixon__-3.42%______NA_______10.46%______NA<br />Ford___-8.44%______NA_______4.11%______NA<br />Carter__-2.10%______NA______-1.04%______NA<br />Reagan__4.33%_____91.33% ___-4.74%______NA<br />GHW___1.09%_____20.28%___-10.24%______17.38%<br />Clinton_-15.89%____4.10%_____-5.12%_____-10.91%<br />GW____0.66%_____6.18%_____-3.09%______-3.31%</p>
<p>I’m kinda suspicious of the Chlamydia figures during the Reagan years.  Is the massive jump because they only started looking for the disease during the Reagan years?  Anyone have any idea?</p>
<p>Otherwise, the only thing I get out of this is that (and this is almost a refrain for someone who looks at data), trends that were going in the right direction under Clinton was reversed under GW (syphilis, chlamydia, AIDS), the trend that was going the wrong way under Clinton (gonorrhea) kept heading in the same direction under GW.  </p>
<p>Anyone see anything else in the data? </p>
<p>(Aside: the quest for data that makes GW looks good continues.)</p>
<p>As usual, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants &#8217;em.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/12/04/news/companies/pluggedin_simons_pfizer.fortune/index.htm?postversion=2006120414">John Simons</a> reports on the bad news for Pfizer, he proves he knows little about financial economics:<br />
<blockquote>When Big Pharma gets too big: The meltdown at Pfizer demonstrates that too many pharmaceutical giants have too much riding on a handful of potential drugs, argues Fortune&#8217;s John Simons.</p>
<p>For as long as anyone on Wall Street can remember, Pfizer executives have promised to follow up Lipitor, the company&#8217;s blockbuster cholesterol pill, with something even bigger and better.  It&#8217;s not an assurance that&#8217;s easily kept. Lipitor, after all, generates $12 billion in annual revenue and is the biggest-selling medicine produced by any Big Pharma &#8211; ever &#8230; In spite of ever-expanding research budgets &#8211; since 1995, annual industry spending on R&#038;D has more than doubled, to $31 billion &#8211; scientists are enjoying fewer eureka moments. Major drugmakers are struggling to come up with enough mass-market blockbuster drugs to maintain the industry&#8217;s fading aura of growth. That&#8217;s fine if the system to produce blockbusters keeps delivering. But when it fails, it fails big, as Pfizer has shown. As the world&#8217;s largest medicine maker and industry bellwether, the New York-based Pfizer&#8217;s setbacks always occur on a grand scale. As everyone knows by now, Pfizer executives wrung their hands all day Saturday, eventually deciding to terminate research on torcetripib, a once-promising experimental medicine designed to boost &#8220;good&#8221; cholesterol. According to an independent body of scientists reviewing data from a 15,000-patient study, torcetripib appeared to cause nearly twice as many deaths as similar drugs. It was an unfortunate discovery for a drug that Pfizer hoped to combine in a single pill with Lipitor. The combined juggernaut would have garnered peak sales of $8 to 10 billion a year, according to analysts. Lipitor could face generic competition as soon as 2010. torcetripib was considered key to bolstering Lipitor&#8217;s sales, once cheaper generic knockoffs enter the market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Patent lives ending and promising drugs not passing phase III clinical trials are a fact of life.  The failure of torcetripib wiped out about 15% of Pfizer’s equity.  But the shareholders retain the other 85%.  Simons is arguing that drug companies should neither merge nor be big.  But let’s consider the implications of having each drug be developed by a separate corporation.  When the promising in-process R&#038;D turns out to be a bust – the entire equity of that corporation disappears.  So one of the alleged reasons for bigness is portfolio diversification.  Then again – I guess one could form a portfolio of single drug companies.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.overcomingbias.com/2006/11/the_big_four_ec.html">Robin Hanson</a> thinks we economists are poorly treated:<br />
<blockquote>Consider how differently the public treats physics and economics.   Physicists can say that this week they think the universe has eleven dimensions, three of which are purple, and two of which are twisted clockwise, and reporters will quote them unskeptically, saying &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that cool!&#8221;   But if economists say, as they have for centuries, that a minimum wage raises unemployment, reporters treat them skeptically and feel they need to find a contrary quote to &#8220;balance&#8221; their story.   I see the same pattern with my students &#8211; they&#8217;ll easily believe physics claims, but are very reluctant to entertain standard economics claims.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an odd example as the employment effect from a higher minimum wage is hotly debated within the economics profession.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_12/010328.php">Kevin Drum</a> counters:<br />
<blockquote>On the economic front, it&#8217;s true that most news reporting about the efficacy of the minimum wage is fairly balanced, but that&#8217;s because there&#8217;s solid economic evidence on both sides of the question. The overall effect of modest increases in the minimum wage is simply not a settled question among economists, which means that reporters should present both sides. And they do. More generally, physics has a small number of moving parts and therefore tends to have more precise and unanimous answers on a broad array of topics. Economics is much more difficult and doesn&#8217;t have the same precision. What&#8217;s worse, economics deals with questions that often have important non-economic dimensions, which means that even when economists do agree on a &#8220;correct&#8221; answer, people may legitimately disagree with them for reasons of social justice, practicality, personal preference, or a hundred other things.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said, but let’s consider a standard claim often made by physicists – and not Robin’s example of 11 dimensions.  If a physicist talked about gravity, how many students would jump off the top of the tallest building on campus just to prove the professor wrong?  But let’s see what set Robin off:<br />
<blockquote>the public having four big biases:  an anti-foreign bias, a make-work bias, an anti-market bias, and a pessimistic bias.</p></blockquote>
<p>He points to <a href="http://www.mercatus.org/repository/docLib/20061011_Straight_Talk_About_Economic_Literacy.pdf">Bryan Caplan</a> and <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2004/09/economic_illite.html">Arnold Kling</a> for more discussion. Caplan and Kling are arguing that economic literacy means one should recognize without question that there are gains from trade.  Maybe it would help if we economists made this argument in a less dogmatic way as it is rather obvious to the common man that movements towards free trade harm some individuals just as it helps others.</p>

                                <p>All y&#8217;all might recall some months back Angry Bear posted a help wanted notice.  I responded, and I&#8217;ve been posting ever since.  But aside for the past week, I have tended to post every few days, which means that most of the burden for keeping the site up and interesting falls on PGL, and while PGL manages to keep up both the quantity and the quality, its a big burden to put on anyone. </p>
<p>What I&#8217;m getting at&#8230; this site would be a bit more interesting if some of you, especially the regulars, responded to Angry Bear&#8217;s help wanted notice.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve learned:<br />1.  Writing these posts takes work, but its a lot of fun, and you learn a lot, both writing the posts and by the comments you get back.  <br />2.  Your writing skills improve.<br />3.  You get to steer the conversation to what you want to discuss.<br />4.  Not all posts have to be long and tough to write.  Often, simple questions to the audience generate a lot of interest among readers.  My post the other day linking to Steve Benen&#8217;s post, and then speculating on information and markets is a case in point.  </p>
<p>Additionally, while the writers and many of the readers are left of center, I suspect we would all be better off with some writers that are right of center.  (I don&#8217;t think we would benefit from writers that are very far left or very far right, however.)  </p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t had any discussion with Angry Bear since he gave me my copy of the keys to the joint, but I would expect he would still happily take new recruits.  But&#8230; maybe you&#8217;re not sure if this is for you.  (Note&#8230; you don&#8217;t have to post frequently to make one heck of a contribution.)  If you want to test the waters&#8230; if you write something up that I think makes sense for this site, I will post it (crediting you, of course).  I don&#8217;t have to agree with it in order to post it either.  (If you send me something, make sure the subject header doesn&#8217;t read like something from an e-mail scam.) </p>
<p>So think about it.  </p>
<p>(And btw&#8230; extremely large former stray cat still needs a permanent home!  Let me share her hard luck story&#8230; when we found her, she had a massive ear infection, which caused her to scratch her ear so strongly that she collapsed her ear.  The vet said she couldn&#8217;t imagine the pain the cat must have been in.  Anyway, the ear infection has been cleared up but that one ear will never reinflate so she is kind of funny looking.  She also walks like a German shepherd.  And she is very friendly to complete strangers.  She is a very unique cat, which makes a conversation piece &#8211; if you&#8217;re a really boring person, and you need some way to spice up your conversations before you drive your last remaining friends away, I have what you need!!!)</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I adjunct professored at an MBA program for five years.  It was a blast and I learned a lot.  Its reasonably likely I&#8217;ll do it again one day depending on time and financial circumstances.  </p>
<p>One thing that always frustrated me, though, was grading.  It was unpleasant, and frankly, I don&#8217;t think there was enough guidance (read &#8211; enough uniformity among professors, which would have to be imposed from above).  The result, of course, is grade inflation.  I suspect that is common, though.  </p>
<p>But there was something that bothered me even more.  I was once at a meeting the Dean of Students convened on grading.  One or two professors from each disciplines were asked to discuss how they graded students.  </p>
<p>I went first.  I noted the various tricks I used to try make myself grade blindly &#8211; I would do everything I could to ensure I didn&#8217;t know which student had turned in which test.  I was somewhat apologetic that I didn&#8217;t entirely succeed &#8211; after a couple of quarters, each student&#8217;s writing style became obvious.  Also, there is no way not to know which student is standing in front of you giving a presentation.</p>
<p>One of the finance professors went next, and his method of grading was similar.  Ditto another finance professor.  Next was an accounting professor &#8211; he didn&#8217;t grade blindly, but he had a very precise formula for assigning points to each question, so effectively, whether or not he knew whose test he was grading at the time, it would make no difference.</p>
<p>But when we got to the &#8211; well, for lack of a better term, the softer or more humanistic fields taught in MBA programs (organizational behavior, marketing, law), the professors had a completely different philosophy.  In fact, professor after professor stressed that it was important to keep in mind which student&#8217;s test was being graded, as it was important to grade a student&#8217;s work holistically.  </p>
<p>The problem with that, for me, is that it is open to abuse.  Maybe I&#8217;m missing something, but it does seem to me that grading holistically, if it is abused, can mean little more that &#8220;well, I like him so he gets an A&#8221; or &#8220;I don&#8217;t like her so she gets a B.&#8221;  Besides&#8230; what does it really mean if the student generally produces A quality work but tanked on one quiz.  Should he/she get an A on that quiz too?  </p>
<p>Does any of this mesh with anyone else&#8217;s experience?  Does grading holistically make any sense to you?</p>
