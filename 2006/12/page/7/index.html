Actually, if 2006Q4 matches the average of the previous three quarters, we’ll be closer to $875 for the 2006 current account deficit.  Looking at the details, exports of goods actually rose by 3.65%, while the increase in imports of goods was 3.72%.  That does not sound like a big difference but remember that during 2006Q2, we exported only $252.843 billion in goods, while we imported $463.441 billion in goods.  Our large current account gap only become wider last quarter – with the big debate being how should we narrow it?</p>

<p>The Current Account hit a new record ( See <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/061218/economy.html?.v=4">here</a>  last summer of $225.6 billion for the quarter.  Just to keep this in perspective, that means that somebody overseas has to buy and hold on to $2.47 billion of our paper every day (That includes weekends and holidays) for the dollar to avoid downward pressure.  This is a tall order and so far the central banks of <country-region st="on"><place st="on">China</place></country-region> and major oil exporters have been more or less equal to the task.  But I would think they are starting to feel a bit like I do when it time for dessert after Thanksgiving dinner.  I know I shouldn’t eat it but it’s not yet time to quit.  So to all those foreign central bankers out there, Bon Appetit!!!</p></p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A few days ago I had <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/in-defense-of-progressive-tax-system.html">a post</a> in which I argued that a progressive tax structure is the one that makes the most sense in the context of capitalism.  I even threw in a quote from Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations saying the same thing.  Of course, many of those who call themselves capitalists would disagree.  </p>
<p>Another thing on which those who call themselves Capitalists – the Steve Forbes and Steven Moores and the various think tanks like the Cato Institute, and even something calling itself the <a href="http://www.adamsmith.org/thinkpiece/000555.php">Adam Smith Institute</a> would disagree with <a href="http://archive.salon.com/politics/feature/2001/02/15/estate_tax/index.html?sid=1012060">Adam Smith on the inheritance tax</a>.</p>
<p>One big argument that those in favor of eliminating the inheritance tax typically have is that an inheritance tax reduces people’s motivation to work; many people, once they achieve financial security, would stop doing productive work if they couldn’t pass on their wealth to their families.  A second big point is that inheritance often allows family enterprises to continue on; put a big enough tax on inheritance, and a person’s heirs would be unable to continue on the family business or family farm.</p>
<p>Now, consider (and I’m not advocating this – we’ll discuss what I’m advocating later) these two positions in the extreme opposite position:  a 100% inheritance tax.  Would those without heirs choose to stop working earlier?  We all know the anecdotes that say yes.  But… for all essential purposes, there are many people today that have no heirs they care about, and thus, on whose estate the tax is essentially 100% today.  They are either estranged from their family, or childless, or whatever.  Do these people stop working sooner than those who have heirs today?  If I was arguing that the inheritance tax should be eliminated, this would be the first thing I’d look for to bolster to my argument.  Perhaps they have, but I don’t recall seeing the Tax Foundation or Heritage putting out any data about this.</p>
<p>Similarly, here’s a thought experiment.  What happens if the gift tax is essentially zero, but the estate tax is confiscatory, or at least higher than the estate tax?  (This may be more than a thought experiment – I’m sure its happened before and would be interested in reader’s comments about when and what happened.)  Well, the bequest argument indicates that a wealthy person would seek to transfer as much wealth as possible to the next generation prior to their death.  And one might argue that you do see some transfer of wealth going on now.  But there is a difference between “as much as possible” and “some.”  I don’t think very many people would willingly give up their entire net worth to their heirs prior to their death, at least not voluntarily.</p>
<p>Put another way, people want to retain control of their wealth, both while alive and while dead.  Disposing of assets is one of the few rights we as a society give the dead.  We don’t allow people to specify who they will vote for in the first election after they pass away, nor do we allow them to drive or even check out library books after they’re dead.</p>
<p>The second point is more interesting.  What would happen to assets if the inheritance tax was 100%?  Well, presumably they’d be sold off to raise government revenues.  (Presumably this would allow the government to reduce taxes on another constituency, namely the living.)  So who would run a business better, someone who scrimped and saved in order to buy the business from the government because he/she thought he/she could do it, or someone whose great-grandfather started the business and who would never sell it because its been in the family for generations?</p>
<p>The argument for a confiscatory inheritance tax is simple.  The beauty of capitalism as described by Adam Smith is that the magic of the free market, guided by the Invisible Hand, moves resources in the direction of their highest marginal product use to society.  (Of course, there are market failures that can move the market away from this happy point:  externalities, crime, market power, etc.)  This works through everyone’s personal greed – I will use resources as efficiently as possible because I benefit most when I do so, and I benefit a lot less when I am wasteful.  In other words, there are costs and benefits to every action.  </p>
<p>Well, the costs and benefits go away with inheritance.  From the point of view the estate passer on, there are no costs associated to passing on an asset to one potential heir as opposed to another potential heir; after all, the estate leaver is already dead.  Contrast that with what happens if the person passes on those assets while alive – the decision has to be made much more carefully.  Of course, there aren’t exactly benefits to passing on an asset to one potential heir as opposed to another potential heir, as, once again, the estate leaver is already dead.</p>
<p>What about the recipient of the inheritance?  Well, there is a big benefit, but no cost associated with it.  No action was needed or taken in order to receive the estate.  Which may be many things, but it is also a market failure as it lies outside the realm of the Invisible Hand.  It also encourages indolence among recipients of large estates, and such indolence can extend for generations.</p>
<p>So what Adam Smith suggest?  Well, he seems to have been something of a realist.  It seems he felt people should be able to pass on a small estate – enough to keep the widow (this was the 18th century, after all) and young children afloat.  But otherwise, Adam Smith, of course, was a capitalist.  He felt that each person should earn his or her own way.</p>
<p>I like to think of myself as both a realist and a capitalist.  I would agree.  I think an inheritance equal to zero for anything up to the median wealth for the country, and rising rapidly to 100% at twice the median wealth for the country would make sense.  Some exceptions could be provided for small children, the elderly, or the handicapped, and there should be no tax on assets passed from one spouse to another.  I think Mr. Smith would approve of such a plan.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This is the plain English translation of the arguments against Chinese maintenance of a weak yuan in order to promote growth in its export sector.  As noted by Nouriel Roubini, (See    <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/167302">here</a> ) what they are doing is channeling an export subsidy through their exchange rate and you could just as easily call it an import subsidy from our point of view.   As noted previously in this blog, exhortations to <country-region><place>China</place></country-region> are unlikely to do much to change their exchange rate policy, but it should be noted that it is equally possible for us to change our exchange rate policy if we like.  But there is symmetry here in that neither we nor the Chinese are likely to do so for precisely the same reason:  Neither country cares to orient its exchange rate policy toward external issues – domestic affairs are paramount for us both.</p>
</p>
<p>Take the Chinese.  They are experiencing extremely rapid growth in their export sector and though they may want to slow it down a bit they certainly don’t want to end it.  There are myriad domestic political and economic imperatives to maintain high growth and problems in the <country-region><place>U.S.</place></country-region> are far less important to the bosses in <city><place>Beijing</place></city> than are the maintenance of their own power, stability and growth.  Besides, the Americans are sending definitely mixed signals – We say we don’t want them to export so much to us but we keep right on buying, even while refusing to act on our own to correct any exchange rate imbalances.  </p>
</p>
<p>Act on our own?  Well of course.  Exchange rates are always a two-sided phenomenon and just as they can (and many would argue should) engineer a yuan appreciation so too can we engineer a dollar depreciation.  Dean Baker has argued for exactly this (See  his blog    <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/">here</a> )  but it is very very unlikely to happen.  To do it the Federal Reserve would have to stand ready to buy yuan until the yuan/dollar  rate reached whatever level they chose.  But there are two very important side-effects of doing this:  First, we wouldn’t be depreciating against just the yuan but against all major freely floating currencies since arbitrage between, e.g. the euro and the yuan would ensure that this was the case.  While this might in fact be desirable, the global readjustments that would ensue would be something of a Pandora’s Box and not something we would want to engage in on a unilateral basis.  Second, such a move would be unambiguously inflationary.  And not only has the Fed never enslaved the money supply to the exchange rate in the post Bretton Woods era, but it would be a cold day in hell when Bernanke and the gang voluntarily decided to add several points to our inflation rate.  In short, domestic considerations trump foreign ones.</p>
</p>
<p>Put another way, the policy makers in both countries dislike the distributional and policy implications of the respective “cures” more than they dislike the distributional and policy implications of the status quo.  But that is far different from pretending that there is nothing they can do about it because it is the other guy’s fault.</p>

<blockquote>A worrisome sign the White House might actually pull off this scam came last week when one of the president&#8217;s biggest cheerleaders for his last pre-emptive strike &#8211; the Editors of National Review &#8211; said they were willing to take personal accounts off the table and accept a Social Security tax increase. Here we go again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said.  OK, Hunter digresses with:<br />
<blockquote>By actuarial standards applicable to any private pension fund, the Social-Security Ponzi scheme already is insolvent, papered over by IOUs Congress has written to itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>But he gets right back on track with:<br />
<blockquote>Social Security&#8217;s near-term cash-flow situation, however, is quite good, scheduled to remain in surplus until 2017; until 2027 if the annual interest due the Trust Fund is taken into account, as it should be. Therefore, higher tax revenues today that enlarged and extended the surpluses would not improve the program&#8217;s solvency; they would only paper it over with more IOUs and magnify the size of the theft Congress perpetrates on the Trust Fund each year. If Congress wants to do something serious about Social Security&#8217;s solvency, it should stop the raid on Social Security, not expand it.  Rather than rush to the nuclear options of raising taxes, cutting future benefits and raising the retirement age, if Congress would only stop stealing the Trust Fund surpluses and get about actually paying the Trust Fund the annual interest owed it and then start using those surpluses and interest payments to begin prefunding future retirees&#8217; retirement, Social Security could be made solvent for decades to come without raising one new dollar in taxes or cutting a single dollar in future benefits or making old people work one year longer. Here&#8217;s a modest proposal: Why doesn&#8217;t the new Congress get itself straight with the American people, stop the raid on Social Security, begin paying the interest it owes to the Social Security Trust Fund and devote those interest payments along with the annual payroll-tax surpluses to financing a refundable tax credit to anyone opening a retirement account for a child younger than 18? Call them Head Start Retirement Accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation – resolve the General Fund fiasco by either cutting spending or raising income taxes (well, Bruce Bartlett would go for consumption taxes while Greg Mankiw advocates taxes on gasoline).</p>

                                <p>For six years, a Republican dominated government increased pork barrel spending – and the Republican President showed no leadership on curbing this.  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/12/16/bush.address.ap/index.html">AP</a> reports that President Bush wishes to change that:<br />
<blockquote>President Bush said Saturday that his administration will outline a series of changes that would clamp down on the common Capitol Hill practice of slipping pet projects into spending bills. These projects, called earmarks, are spending provisions that often are put into bills at the last minute, so they never get debated or discussed, Bush said in his weekly radio address. &#8220;It is not surprising that this often leads to unnecessary federal spending, such as a swimming pool or a teapot museum tucked into a big spending bill,&#8221; he said. The president said his administration&#8217;s proposal would make earmarks more transparent, make lawmakers more accountable for the earmarks they propose, and help reduce the overall number of earmarks. Many lawmakers claim they are better suited than others in government to know what their states need. Bush said the use of earmarks has exploded, and pointed to a Congressional Research Service report that the number of earmarks has increased from about 3,000 in 1996 to 13,000 this year. &#8220;I respect Congress&#8217; authority over the public purse, but the time has come to reform the earmark process and dramatically reduce the number of earmarks,&#8221; Bush said.

Democrats, who will take control of Congress on January 4, already announced their plan to wipe out billions of dollars in lawmakers&#8217; home-state projects in unfinished spending bills. On Monday, the incoming Democratic chairmen of the House and Senate Appropriations committees announced they would eliminate earmarks from the nine unfinished spending bills for the budget year that began October 1. Rep. David Obey, D-Wisconsin, and Sen. Robert Byrd, D-West Virginia, said they would restore earmarking in the upcoming 2008 budget cycle, but only after implementing changes. Obey said he was pleased the president supports their plan. &#8220;But it should be noted that all of the earmarks combined don&#8217;t begin to match the increase in the deficit caused by the president wasting $50 billion in supersized tax cuts for those making more than $1 million a year while other Americans sleep on the streets,&#8221; Obey said. This summer, Republicans announced changes to require spending bills to carry lists of earmarks and their sponsors. That&#8217;s a good start, Bush said, but more needs to be done by both parties. &#8220;Republicans and Democrats alike have an opportunity to demonstrate our commitment to spending restraint and good government by making earmark reform a top priority for the next Congress,&#8221; Bush said. &#8220;When it comes to spending your money, you expect us to rise above party labels.&#8221; Byrd said any effort to change the way business gets done in Washington cannot begin and end with the appropriations process. &#8220;We also must address earmarks in the tax codes which have resulted in huge loopholes for corporate America while middle-class America is left holding the bag,&#8221; Byrd said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Senator Byrd is right in this sense – if we are going to significantly cut the deficit, eliminating earmarks is only a small first step.  I hope we can trust what Bush says here and get on with a bipartisan approach to fiscal sanity.  But I have one question – why did he wait six years to get serious about this (assuming he is serious)?</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve linked to Steve Benen&#8217;s stuff before.  Here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/9364.html">nice post</a>&#8230; it starts as simply by looking at numbers of attacks in Iraq, but then transitions into a short list of data series the administration has decided the government should no longer track.  Namely:</p>
<p>&#8220;* In March, the administration announced it would no longer produce the Census Bureau’s Survey of Income and Program Participation, which identifies which programs best assist low-income families, while also tracking health insurance coverage and child support.</p>
<p>* In 2005, after a government report showed an increase in terrorism around the world, the administration announced it would stop publishing its annual report on international terrorism.</p>
<p>* After the Bureau of Labor Statistics uncovered discouraging data about factory closings in the U.S., the administration announced it would stop publishing information about factory closings.</p>
<p>* When an annual report called “Budget Information for States” showed the federal government shortchanging states in the midst of fiscal crises, Bush’s Office of Management and Budget announced it was discontinuing the report, which some said was the only source for comprehensive data on state funding from the federal government.</p>
<p>* When Bush’s Department of Education found that charter schools were underperforming, the administration said it would sharply cut back on the information it collects about charter schools.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Links to each of these are provided in Benen&#8217;s original post.) </p>
<p>What are other sources of data that the administration has decided not to track any more?  (Let&#8217;s leave out M3 &#8211; that&#8217;s a Fed issue.)</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A perpetual problem for those needing transplanted organs is the lack of organs to transplant.  There is an obvious obstacle to this:  Asking a grieving family to give away spare parts from their just-deceased loved one is hard for doctors to do in addition to the fact that it is done at exactly the time when family members least want to hear it.  In the minutes just before or after a death (and it often is a case of minutes) the enormity of what is happening makes people want to shut out everything else, especially things that emphasize the finality of death.  And asking for the dying person’s heart, kidneys, liver, etc. does that in a way few other things can.</p>
<p>Some proposals have surfaced from time to time suggesting that people be compensated for organs.  Certainly those receiving the organs would be willing to pay in order to live but the whole idea of an organ market (which is alleged to exist in the black market anyway) is so fraught with difficulties that it is a virtual minefield of moral problems.  It can make even a cold-blooded economistic capitalist squeamish to think about rich people paying poor ones for body parts not to mention the plot lines of several action-packed horror movies and novels.</p>
<p>So how to get around this problem?  The solution would seem to be to ask people for permission to harvest organs (what an unfortunate piece of bad marketing THAT phrase is – “harvest organs”) before their loved ones are dying rather than during or after.  This is exactly what the checkoff box on the back of my drivers’ license is supposed to do, but unfortunately not enough people actually check it off to bring the supply of organs anywhere near the demand.
</p>
<p>What about giving people an up-front incentive to do so?  This could be accomplished by waiving the license fee for anyone willing to check off the organ donation box on their license and sign the necessary permission form.  The state would lose some revenue (It costs $40 for a license where I live) but the potential benefits are enormous.  I think there are quite a few people who would be willing to sign at the time they get the license whose family members wouldn’t give permission if they died.  To sweeten the pot we could even invent a shorter line at the Department of Motor Vehicles just for them.  Now THAT would be even more persuasive.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/16/business/16econ.html?ref=business">Jeremy Peters</a> dusts off the fear of rising wages card:<br />
<blockquote>The other wild card is labor costs. Economists cautioned that rising wages could pressure businesses to raise prices in the months ahead. “People have been expressing a lot of relief over declining energy prices while seeming to neglect the rise in labor costs,” Richard F. Moody, chief economist with Mission Residential, a real estate investment firm. “Now with oil over $60 a barrel, it looks like it could be both energy costs and labor costs.” For the first time in four years, wages are significantly outpacing inflation. A separate Labor Department report yesterday showed that while wage gains have slowed slightly in the last month, workers are still enjoying the strongest buying power in years. When adjusted for inflation, the average hourly wage of a worker in a position below management level rose 2.3 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we go again.  What to say?  Oh yea, let’s have <a href="http://www.prospect.org/deanbaker/2006/12/if_there_is_inflation_the_prob.html#014850">Dean Baker</a> step up to the microphone:<br />
<blockquote>Real wages have risen less than 2 percent over the last five years. Because of the sharp drop in gas prices over the last four months, real wages have grown rapidly over this period. Of course, once oil prices stop falling (as they already have) real wages will be growing in the range of 1.0-1.5 percent annually, well below the 2.7 percent rate of productivity growth of the last five years. Since real wage growth is clearly trailing productivity growth, why are reporters so obsessed with the idea that wage growth is causing inflation?</p></blockquote>
<p>While real wages have risen by less than 2% over the past 2 year, almost all of that increase occurred in 2002 and 2003 as we pointed out <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/real-wage-growth-over-past-three-years.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/greg-mankiw-on-real-wages-auditioning.html">here</a>.  </p>
<p>Given the National Review cheerleading about how great the 2003 tax cut was (see for example the latest from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTIyY2M2ZjgwMTZlYjQ2YjA5MGQxMWYyOThkMWZlN2Q=">Fuzzcharts</a>, I wish they’d explain why real wage growth is essentially zero if the economy is so wonderful.  Real wage growth between the two tax cuts (the National Review crowd now claim they opposed the 2001 tax cut – ha, ha, ha) was stronger than it has been since the anointed supply-side miracle.  OK, employment was falling between the two tax cuts.  But I do seem to recall the National Review pundits predicting a great recovery if Congress passed Bush’s first tax cut.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Here&#8217;s a post by reader Ken Melvin, tackling the issue of illegal immigrants and how it affects the official unemployment figures in the US:</p>
<p>E/P Ratio, Disappearing Americans, and Illegal Immigrants</p>
<p>In the beginning &#8211; a model.  For this model, 80% of the current population of some 300 million are between 16 and 65, and some 70% of this 240 million, i.e., some 166 million, are available for work for which they are qualified that pays a decent wage.  That is to say that, in the model, some 166 million of the current 300 million (US population November 2006) are in ‘the labor pool’ or ‘labor force’.  If 150 million of the 166 million citizens are employed in 2006, then the remaining 16 million are unemployed.  The ratio of this 150 million employed to the 240 million of the population between 16 and 65 years of age, 62.5%, is known as the employment to population ratio, E/P.  The ratio of the 16 million unemployed to the 166 million people available for work as a percentage, 9.6%, is the percent of work force unemployed, or the rate of unemployment.</p>
<p>If someone can’t find work, after awhile they may look for work less often and after a greater while they may stop looking altogether.  In the real world of labor statistics, such persons are dropped from both the unemployed and the ‘labor force’, i.e., they are dropped from both the numerator and denominator of the equation for calculating the unemployment level.   This masks and distorts both increases and decreases in unemployment.  As unemployment increases, discouraged job seekers are dropped from both the rolls of the unemployed and the rolls of those available for work lessening the increase in ‘official’ unemployment.  Similarly, when employment increases, those who had given up looking for worked move back into the labor force.  </p>
<p>The period from the mid 1990s to 2000 provides a good example of what occurs during a decrease in unemployment.  During this time, the number of jobs added exceeded the population increase by a significant ratio for a period of some six years but unemployment only went down some 2%.   The official unemployment rate in 1994 was 6.1%.   If the available work force in 1994 was 145 million this 6.1% unemployment equates some 8.8 million unemployed persons.  If the 1994 available work force was 145 million and the population grew at 1%/yr during the period, by 2000, one would expect the work force to be approximately 1.07 times 145 million or about 155 million.  </p>
<p>Some 15 million jobs were added during this period from 1994 to 2000.  Of these 15 million added jobs, some 10 million went to cover the increase in work force due population growth.  Some 2.6 million of the remaining 5 million jobs went the change in the number of unemployment from 8.8 million in 1994 to 6.2 million in 2000. The remaining 2.4 million represent some portion of the work force that had been ‘disappeared’ prior 1994. This means that the actual number of unemployed in 1994 was at least 11.2 million (8.8 million plus 2.4 million), and the actual unemployment rate at least 7.7%.  So, how much credence accord 2000’s 4% unemployment figure?  Was 4% too low?  If so, how much?  Thus and so, the unemployed are disappeared during times of increasing unemployment only to reappear when job growth exceeds population growth.</p>
<p>But, the unemployed disappeared as above don’t disappear from the population, P, of the E/P ratio.   The E of E/P (numerator) is the number employed, and the P of the E/P (denominator) is the portion of the total population within an age range.   Thus it is that the current E/P ratio is low.  The 2.2% difference between the E/Ps of 2000 and 2005 represents some 5 million disappeared unemployed (about the same number pulled in the gap from 2001 to 2004 that was never made up, see <a href="http://www.bls.gov/web/ces_cps_trends.pdf">Chart 1 at </a>, or an increase of some 3% in actual unemployment.  </p>
<p>In October 2006, 4.7% was given as the official unemployment rate.  At this time, payroll, from Chart 1: was some 135 million, yielding a labor force of some 142 million.  The official E/P ratio of 62.5% suggests an ‘age group population’ of some 216 million.  On these bases, the 4.7% unemployment rate equates some 7 million unemployed workers.  In 2000, official unemployment was 4% and payroll 133 million, yielding a labor force of 138.5 million.  And, the official E/P of 64.6% suggested a ‘population’ of some 206 million.   During the six years, employment should have increased to some 141.3 million (1.07 x 133 &#8211; 0.007 x 142).   </p>
<p>Note, adding the approximately 5 million ‘disappeared’ during the gap pulled from 2001 to 2004 spoken to above to 2006’s 135 million equals some 140 million, which is quite close to 141.3 million.  And, for 2006, if we add the approximately 5 million ‘disappeared’ during the gap of 2001 to 2004 to both the 7.1 million of the numerator and the 142 million ‘labor force’ denominator, the unemployment rate for 2006 is some 8.2% [(12/147) x 100], which equates to some 12 million unemployed.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the labor force was 155 million in 2000 and increased by 1% a year to 166 million in 2006 but payroll employment only increased some 3 million from 2000 to 2006 there is a deficit of some 8 million jobs (166 – 155 – 3).  The 1% increase in unemployment, from 4% in 2000 to 4.7% in 2006, accounts for less than 2 million of this deficit.  The remaining more than 6 million deficit amounts to an additional some 3.6% unemployment which added to the official 4.7% equals a current actual unemployment of some 8.3% (3.6 + 4.7) meaning that there are more than 13.8 million unemployed.</p>
<p>Per the model, if employment is some 150 million and the E/P ratio some 62.5%, then the ‘population’ is some 240 million, the labor force is some 168 million, and there are some 18 million (168 &#8211; 150) unemployed workers for an actual unemployment rate of some 10.7%.</p>
<p>By most accounts, upwards of a million illegal workers have entered the US each year since 2000.  It is generally accepted that more than 12 million are in residence.  It is generally acknowledged that these illegal immigrant workers make up at least 5% of the US work force, i.e., at least 7.5 million of the some 150 million total jobs in 2006 were held by illegal workers.  In other words, the real employment to population ration in 2006 is not 62.2%, [(150/240) x 100 = 62.2%], but rather it is some 59.4%, [(142.5/240) x 100 = 59.4%].   This also means that actual unemployment among legal US workers is greater than 9.5% [(7.5 + 8.3)/(166)] x 100.</p>
<p>Combining the effect of illegal workers with the disappeared; actual unemployment among legal US workers in 2006 is on the order of 12.5%,  [(7.5 + 5 + 8.3)/166] x 100.</p>
<p>Beyond taking the jobs of millions of US citizens and other legal workers, illegal workers work for lower wages thus forcing down wages in those industries where they work.  The effect of illegal workers on the economy is almost exactly the same as that of offshoring.</p>
<p>Finally, a distinction between illegal Chinese workers and those from Latin America: While illegal workers from Latin America take jobs normally held by US citizens, i.e., the displacement is direct; those from China tend to work exclusively for other Chinese as waiters, chefs, seamstresses, laborers, etc.  The restaurants, shops, etc., where they work have such low prices that similar businesses with legal worker staffs simply can’t compete and are forced to close.</p>
