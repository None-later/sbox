                                                                    </div>

                                <p>While we <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/celebrating-demise-of-zarqawi-by.html">noted</a> how Jonah Goldberg smeared Congressman Murtha, we also join Duncan Black (who awarded Goldberg Wanker of the Day for his dishonesty) in tipping the hat to <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/node/30673">Matthew Yglesias</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Jonah Goldberg misquotes John Murtha, truncating his statement in a manner that substantially alters the meaning. Following up, he justifies his action by noting that The New York Times did the same thing later. We&#8217;re not even in &#8220;two wrongs don&#8217;t make a right&#8221; territory here. I suppose this is the logic by which so many people feel comfortable misrepresenting what Al Gore said about the Internet. Since everyone&#8217;s misquoting him, it&#8217;s okay for everyone to misquote him. Something like that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shorter Matt – Jonah is a serial liar but then that’s the job description when you write for the National Review.  Well it seems <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTdiNjU1MGMwYjliNzllZDc1YTRhMGYxYTdiMWY5NmU=">Goldberg</a> is at it again:<br />
<blockquote>But my first reaction to the news that Murtha intends to run for Majority Leader if the Dems take back the Congress was that it&#8217;s a shrewd calculation to rev-up the base. Murtha is the leader of the bug-out of Iraq caucus. If Murtha makes it clear that a vote for a  Democratic Congress is a vote for a bug-out leadership, that might rally the Democratic shock troops and/or leftwing donors.  If they took back Congress, they could claim, openly or with some nuance, that the &#8217;06 election was a referendum on the war.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me admit that I’ve been with Howard Dean all along on this issue, which put me on the opposite end of the spectrum from Murtha.  Dean realized in 2002 two thing that Jonah Goldberg is incapable of understanding: (1) President Bush and his team were lying to us about the imminent threat nonsense; and (2) our invading Iraq was a victory for Osama bin Laden.  But after this utterly stupid decision was made, it did seem prudent to follow the Joe Biden lead of finishing the task.</p>
<p>But Biden, Dean, and yours truly were making one rather stupid assumption – that this Administration might be capable of finishing the task.  Murtha has shown great courage – something else beyond Goldberg’s ability to comprehend – in admitting his 2002 position was wrong (yes- Howard Dean was right in 2002).  And I have changed my mind – the Bush Administration has so badly managed the post invasion process in Iraq, for us to stay allows for more victories for Osama bin Laden.  </p>
<p>I’ll admit that bugging out will also be seen as a victory for Osama bin Laden.  But some of us were saying back in 2002 that invading Iraq would be us precisely in the lose, lose situation that permeates the discussion today.  For our wisdom back then – the demagogues who support this White House called us traitors.  Stupidity as patriotism and foresight as treason.  Par for the course at the National Review.</p>
<p><strong>Footnote</strong>: In case you are wondering how the New York Times got dragged into the discussion of Goldberg’s dishonesty, look at <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Nzk5NGE5NGUzNzQ4ZWY5ODU1M2RkYjMxYTM1YzQzNzc=">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So all day, I&#8217;ve been getting what I think is pretty baseless and silly grief from lefty readers ridiculing my lack of integrity &#8230; I guess that right wing New York Times is part of the problem, too. </p></blockquote>
<p>We accurately cite Goldberg’s own post and he calls this baseless?  The problem with blaming his dishonesty on the New York Times goes back to what Goldberg linked and it was not the New York Times inaccurate characterization of the interview but another source that did accurately capture what Murtha said.  Goldberg is either being dishonest about his dishonesty or is being incredibly stupid.</p>

Clarke</a> defend CEO compensation in part by claiming that the granting of employee stock options is like handing out free money.  He notes the compensation package of the retired chairman of Exxon Mobil, Lee Raymond:<br />
<blockquote>On this last point, options are typically granted from time to time at an exercise price equal to the market price of the stock on the date of the grant. At some point (often after 10 years), the options must be exercised, or they will be forfeited … But here’s what’s most important: In this example, the company paid the CEO a total of $12.5 million &#8211; not $69.7 million. The $57.2 million difference is a gain in the value of the shares earned by this CEO’s stewardship of the company. Importantly, the rest of the company’s shareholders (including, but not limited to, your pension plan and your mother’s trust fund) realized the same proportionate gain.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/06/free_lunch_for_.html">Mark Thoma</a> reads this sentence, watches his head explode, but manages to put himself back together to write something a lot more coherent:<br />
<blockquote>You are the CEO of a company but instead of paying you in cash, the company gives you an option to buy, say, 1,000 shares of stock any time during the next ten years at the current $100 price ($100,000 total). Over the next ten years, suppose the price of the stock increases to $250 so the 1,000 shares are worth $250,000 and the CEO exercises the option at the end of the ten year period. The easiest way to think about this is to imagine the company going out and buying the stock on the market at $250 per share at the end of the ten year period (if it purchased them in the past, the $250 is still the opportunity cost). Since the company receives $100 per share from the CEO, the option price, the company loses $150 per share, or $150,000. The argument is that &#8220;compensating [CEOs] &#8230; has not come at the expense of company profits.&#8221; Where do the writers of this commentary think the money comes from if it isn&#8217;t from the company&#8217;s bottom line?</p></blockquote>
<p>Given the fact that companies often avoid stock dilution by purchasing shares when employees exercise these options, there is indeed a cash outflow as Mark suggests.  While Mark follows Nugent &#038; Clarke in terms of looking at the ex post value of the options, let’s use this <a href="http://www.blobek.com/black-scholes.html">Black-Scholes calculator</a> to think in terms of the ex ante value of an option with a 10-year term.  If the strike price equals the initial market price of the shares, which is $100 in Mark’s example, and if we assume no dividends, an interest rate of 5%, and volatility  = 20 (ConocoPhillip’s 10-K was suggesting 22.5), the ex ante value of these options would be around $45.  Not exactly a free lunch – is it?  Now if you read carefully, the 10-K filing I was using, you might have noticed that the expected life of ConocoPhillip’s options were 7.18 not 10 so maybe we should assume an option price of only $37.  You might have also noticed that these types of companies pay out dividends to shareholders to the shareholders, so that the simple Black-Scholes equation overstates the true value of these options.  </p>
<p>But if Nugent &#038; Clarke think that issuing options to CEOs does not have a cost to the shareholders of the company, there are not qualified to write about executive compensation.  Which is of course why they get to write for the National Review.</p>

<p>Notice something – his own chart drawn from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/jlt/home.htm">JOLTS</a> (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) says this figure is 4.1 million, which my math teacher said was LESS than 5 million.  Also, job openings typically rise during recoveries – and this recovery was bound to happen even with the 2003 tax cut.  Also realize that the labor force typically rising over time.  While the labor force participation rate was around 67% before Bush took office, it seems stuck at around 66% now. </p>

The first reporting of this rate was during the last month of Clinton’s term in office (I bet the rightwing just hates that).  The rate fell during the recession and has only partially recovered.  </p>

                                <p>The death of <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/06/08/iraq.al.zarqawi/index.htmlX">Abu Musab al-Zarqawi</a> was welcome news for almost all Americans – liberal or conservative – even if it provided the opportunity for certain <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTFmMDQ2ZDMzNDc4ZTQ2MGQ5YWI4NGQ2Y2JiNzYzNjk=">wingnuts</a> to suggest we Democrats were not elated.  In the same vein, Jonah Goldberg is either displaying his inability to read or defending his own dishonesty.</p>
<p>We noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/sulli-v-goldberg-on-ponnurus-party-of.html">some time ago</a> that Mr. Goldberg loves to lecture Andrew Sullivan for not reading things as Mr. Goldberg displays his own inability to read.  Or was the following his penchant for dishonesty. <a href="http://www.shadowtv.com/redirect/notification.jsp?vid=b5b18ff8c9f35188b58930aa3f629b73">John Murtha</a> states in an interview:<br />
<blockquote>This is significant, one, the fact that Zarqawi is killed but also the fact they appointed a defense minister and interior minister. There&#8217;s no question we can&#8217;t win this militarily. It&#8217;s a matter of time. The Iraqis are getting better. I think the intelligence came from the Iraqis, as I understand it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjhlMzA2NjcyODBkNjgyNzc0ODMxYWViOGIyZTkxZjA">Goldberg</a> writes:<br />
<blockquote>In an interview with CNN he stays on message. There&#8217;s no reason necessarily to think we needed troops in Iraq to get Zarqawi and &#8220;we cannot win this.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, Goldberg later acknowledged that a reader called him on this honesty &#8211; excusing himself by noting he provided a link.  Pathetic?  Dishonest?  Stupid?  All of the above?  Yet – it is par for the course for those over at the Corner of the National Review.  To them – al Qaeda is not the enemy as their war is with Democrats.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YzliZTEzYWFmOTQ3ZmEyMjNjZjExZDczMmMyYTc3MWM=">Rich Lowry</a> takes bashing Democrats to a new – and very low – level:<br />
<blockquote>But sometimes the ledger is indeed quite simple—with Zarqawi’s demise, the sum total of evil in the world is now a little less. Everyone professes to know this. But some know it more than others. Otherwise a major Democrat like John Kerry wouldn’t be advocating a full U.S. pullout from Iraq … Within hours of the news breaking of Zarqawi’s death, Rep. John Murtha was on CNN saying we should leave Iraq and let the Iraqis work out their civil war just the way we worked out ours &#8230; From beyond the grave, Zarqawi can only wish that the Democrats for a pullout had been able to affect their preferred policy already. Then this loathsome man who so needed killing would instead still be working his evil will.</p></blockquote>
<p>We were staying in Iraq only so we could kill Zarqawi?  Never mind how utterly stupid such statements are – doesn’t it follow that Zarqawi’s demise means we can leave NOW – assuming one is crazy enough to accept Lowry’s logic.  Speaking of which, what on earth does this mean?<br />
<blockquote>Killing Zarqawi is the equivalent of averting a Haditha every other day in Iraq, indefinitely.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that we finally decided to pull the trigger on Zarqawi – something that Bush said no to on three occasions in 2002 – in no way excuses Haditha.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-boehlert/the-washington-times-slim_b_22599.html">Eric Boehlert</a> notes that the Washington Times headline was nothing more than a lie.</p>

                                <p>One would think the Senate was considering the repeal of the <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/06/08/pf/taxes/estate_tax_debate/index.htm">estate tax</a>.  OK, this effort died.</p>
<p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDg3Zjk0YWRhNjZiMWQyM2FiYmUwYjZkMTU0MzZjYzA=">Deroy Murdock</a> appeals to environmentalists to support the repeal of the estate tax with this claim:<br />
<blockquote>A predominantly Democratic group of U.S. senators wants to preserve a law that destroys 2.98 million acres of forests annually an area the size of Yellowstone and Yosemite national parks, combined. When the Senate votes this morning, Republicans and fair-minded Democrats should stop this arboricide by killing the federal death tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>To be honest, this one is a new one on me.  Now if this claim sounds absurd &#8211; Murdock has several sources including a collection of the usual spin from <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/tbb/tbb-0606-36.pdf">Chris Edwards</a>.   Murdock suggests that Edwards said the following:<br />
<blockquote>While liberals support the Death Tax in order to break up concentrations of wealth, large and concentrated land holdings often are good for the environment, the Death Tax winds up favoring developers over natural habitat.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I see a lot of nutty claims in the Edwards piece but nothing along this line.  Murdock references a 2001 piece by Dan Miller &#8211; one of Saxton’s hacks at the Joint Economic Committee, but all this piece did was to cite some 1995 piece by something called the Keystone Center:<br />
<blockquote>Federal estate tax requirements are a major obstacle for private landowners whose land stewardship has been sensitive to its environmental value and who would like to be able to pass on their land to their heirs without destroying that value. The imposition of federal estate taxes often forces large parcels of environmentally valuable land to be broken up into smaller, less environmentally valuable parcels. Some of the best remaining habitat for endangered species is put at risk in this manner</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a far cry from this claim that habitat might be put at risk to Murdock’s claim that the estate tax destroys 3 million acres a year.   But it seems that the <a href="http://www.cei.org/utils/printer.cfm?AID=1592">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a> relied on this Keystone quote to put forth Murdock’s spin many years ago.  No matter how absurd the argument nor how dishonest the cherry picked quotes can be – these canards as to the alleged negative effects of the estate tax never die.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NWM2NmVkN2E0Y2I1MGY3YjAyM2M3OTMyODY2OGY5MmY=">The Corner</a> flashes back to <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/miller/miller200406020843.asp">John J. Miller</a> where he said that Chris Edwards and Stephen Slivinski are two of the smartest budget/fiscal policy guys in Washington.  Really?!</p>
<p>Now the whole point of this NTO oped is to show us how easily we could cut $300 billion out of the Federal budget “without touching defense appropriations or homeland security outlays (with the exception of privatizing the Transportation Security Administration and a few other small-bore reforms)”.  And by some higher order differential calculus that only Edwards and Slivinski comprehend, a $300 billion spending cut will eliminated a $500 billion budget deficit.  Miller writes:<br />
<blockquote>So how hard is it to find $300 billion to trim? Not so tough, if you follow the Cato methodology.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s add the proposals up – eliminate the Community Development Block Grants in the Department of Housing and Urban Development and save $6 billion a year PLUS eliminate the Traffic Control to save another $3 billion a year.  Hey, why do we need air traffic control when these Cato rocket scientists can translate $9 million into $300 billion and eliminate a $500 billion deficit by “magic. Presto!”?<br />Actually – Edwards did propose $300 billion in spending cuts, which included almost $25 billion in reductions for spending on elementary and secondary education.  Perhaps today’s lesson is that any reader of the National Review who does not realize that Murdock and Miller are blowing smoke likely need to go back to elementary school.  <br />But <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002266.html">Max Sawicky</a> picks up on this statement from Chris Edwards:<br />
<blockquote>Much of the value in large estates consists of unrealized capital gain, which currently avoids capital gains taxes because asset basis is stepped up to market value at death. That has the effect of reducing federal revenues by more than $50 billion annually.  </p></blockquote>
<p>Max fires back:</p>
<blockquote><p>In other words, this income is the bulk of large estates and but for the estate tax, it would never be taxed.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s give Chris the last word:</p>
<blockquote><p>Under most estate tax repeal plans, some portion of unrealized gains would be carried over to heirs who would pay tax when they sold the assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Could someone call a tax attorney? Oh wait, the attorney won’t be interested in the proposed change in tax law as it thankfully failed.</p>

                                <p>It is interesting to witness the spin from both sides on Brian Bilbray’s narrow defeat over Francine Busby.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_06/008961.php">Steve Benes</a> who is doing an excellent job over at Kevin Drum’s blog writes:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s very much reminiscent of Jean Schmidt narrowly defeating Paul Hackett is Ohio&#8217;s 2nd last year &#8211; a race that the GOP was supposed to win easily went down to the wire, and ended up costing Republicans a fortune. Put it this way: if the GOP has to work this hard just to keep ordinarily &#8211; safe Republican districts in November, they better raise more money than they&#8217;ve ever raised before.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGI5N2ZmMjQxMGRjYWRmMjU0MzBkYmUyOWZjMjlmNjU">John Pitney</a> writing for the National Review claims:<br />
<blockquote>In a couple of ways, the outcome was quite remarkable. As of the last FEC report, Busby had raised more money than Bilbray.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well she did raise over $2 million whereas Bilbray raised only $1 million.  Of course, other Republicans running for the Dukester’s former seat also raised a fair chunk of change.  </p>
<p>Steve Benes said something about $5 million coming from the RNCC, which was not included in Pitney’s spin – but <a href="http://www.hillnews.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/052506/calif.html">Jonathan Kaplan</a> suggests a lower figure and notes the DNCC spent a little down south from where I live:<br />
<blockquote>On May 22, the National Republican Congressional Committee reported having spent $1.1 million on direct mail, phone calls, polling and issue ads to help former Rep. Brian Bilbray (R-Calif.), according to records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC). On May 11, the committee reported spending more than $641,000. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spent $790,000 between May 14 and 20 on television advertising in California’s 50th Congressional District on behalf of Bilbray’s Democratic opponent, Francine Busby.</p></blockquote>
<p>I listened to Bilbray say why he thought he won and as the AP and <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/07/primaries.roundup.ap/index.html">CNN</a> put it:<br />
<blockquote>Bilbray made immigration the centerpiece of his campaign, proposing a fence &#8220;from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico&#8221; and restrictions to keep illegal immigrants from collecting Social Security and other benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Bilbray opposes President Bush’s immigration reform – I suspect Karl Rove is happy that hate and fear still represents a winning strategy for certain Republicans.</p>
<p>Note also that AP and CNN put the figures from the national treasures of each party a little higher than what Kaplan suggested.</p>

                                <p>AB read Catcus questions the following claim from NRO’s <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWRjMmQ3MzNmZGE3NzNkNWJhNDkyYjE5MTgxMDgzMmM=">Greg Kaza</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Since Bush took office in January 2001, government jobs have dropped by 51,000 &#8211; nearly 2 percent. That may not look like much, but it is a continuation of a trend that represents a small victory for fiscal conservatives and economic libertarians &#8211; those who support limited government and the philosophical principle of a smaller federal labor force.</p></blockquote>
<p>Catcus points us to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2007/sheets/hist17z1.xls">OMB table 17.1</a>.  Employment by the Civilian Agencies has increased by more than Department of Defense employment has declined.  So with a Global War on Terror and that idiotic decision to commit troops to invading Iraq, isn’t odd that someone who wants a permanent tax cut is increasing employment by Civilian Agencies but cutting DoD employment?  </p>

<p>So what is Kaza using to back up his claim?</p>
<blockquote><p>The data show that total federal employment peaked under President George H.W. Bush at 3.4 million in May 1990. That number, as measured by the BLS, fell to 3 million by the time Bush the Elder left office … As of the latest jobs report, total federal employment under George W. Bush was 2.7 million in May 2006. That represents a loss of more than one in every five federal employees since 1990.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Kaza does admit that Federal employment fell under Bill Clinton, he fails to note that Federal employment under George W. Bush went up before it went down.  And the small net decline in employment since George W. Bush took office is more than 100% explained by the reduction in employment by the Post Office.  Federal employment not including the Post Office has increased under George W. Bush.</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a2-745680.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a2-702977.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Kaza wants us to believe that we are more free simply because the Post Office has less employees now than it did when George W. Bush took office.  I don’t know if the reduction in employment at the U.S. Postal Service is from FEDEX, UPS, and DHL gaining market share or whether it’s the postal service becoming more efficient.  As far as freedom, I’d be more concerned what the NSA is doing in terms of wire tapping Aunt Bee and even if they could do so efficiently, a reduction in NSA employment would not translate into an increase in freedom.  As far as DoD employment, Rumsfeld thought he could efficiently fight two wars without increasing the number of troops.  How is that working out?</p>

<blockquote>To get a sense of why economic growth is so important, look at Figure 1. In Figure 1 the relationship between compensation and productivity is plotted over about a 55-year period. The compensation series used here is called the real product wage, which is a comprehensive measure of total compensation. Although these curves do not line up on a yearly basis, it is quite clear that wages and productivity are highly linked. A related measure of compensation, real after-tax income has also increased substantially, rising by a total of 12.9 percent since January 2001, and $2,140 per person.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Lazear factored in the current tax cuts without including those deferred tax liabilities (tax shift – not tax cut).  </p>
<p>Max reads the footnotes and writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you check the bottom, you see the deflator used is the &#8220;price index for nonfarm output,&#8221; the result of which is the &#8220;real product wage.&#8221; I had never heard of that before, but I&#8217;m no labor/price index savant. The trick here is that the deflator is for all output, including intermediate goods. The worker, by contrast, is more interested in the prices for the stuff he buys, not for machine tools and electric generators. If you use the Consumer Price Index you get a different picture</p></blockquote>
<p>Max gets into the details, which makes me realize I’m certainly no savant.  But I did some checking over at the source for <a href="http://www.bea.gov/">NIPA tables</a> and found table 1.9.4 – Price Indexes for Net Value Added by Sector, which shows annual data through 2004.  From 2000 to 2004, the general rise in prices was about 10%, which tracked the increase in consumer prices.  For the business sector, prices rose by 7.8% &#8211; but here is where it gets fun.  While the nonfarm price index rose by only 7.4%, the price index for the farm sector rose by over 68%.  So if one does not have to eat – one might have seen an increase in one’s standard of living!</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/04/business/yourmoney/04view.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print">Daniel Gross</a> has a nice article about all those economic statistics being tossed around by the Bush Pollyannas, which include Rudolph Giuliani:</p>
<blockquote><p>In Iowa last month, Rudolph W. Giuliani bluntly dismissed concerns about the economy and higher gas prices by saying, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re all so upset about.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder how much Exxon stock is in Giuliani’s portfolio?  It is true that the reported unemployment rate is 4.6% but compare the 63% employment to population ratio now to the 64% plus employment to population ratio during most of Clinton’s second term.  </p>
<p>Gross noted more spin from Treas. Sec. Snow:</p>
<blockquote><p>In addition, aggregates generally are averages, which are of declining utility in an economy characterized by greater inequality of income and assets. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in March, Mr. Snow took pains to point out that there had been substantial gains in per-capita income (8.2 percent, after inflation) and net worth (24 percent, before inflation) from the beginning of 2001 to the end of 2005. The data he cited were averages, or means, and that can be misleading. &#8220;The average wage is a useful indicator if you want to know what&#8217;s happening to the tax base, but it might not tell you what&#8217;s going on for the individual worker,&#8221; said Alan B. Krueger</p></blockquote>
<p>Rising inequality is a good point but the notion that we are all much wealthier does not hold up under closer analysis.  Let’s remember that per capita wealth at the end of 2005 was about the same as it was at the end of 1999.  And even if we 2001 as the start date, the <a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2006/06/mean_median.html">New Economist</a> reminds us that mean growth is not the same as median growth.   The median household saw very little increase in real wealth over this period.</p>
<p>Most of the increases in income have accrued to profits and not real wages.  Real wages for many have fallen with the increase in fringe benefits is largely going to pay for more expensive health insurance premiums.  As far as real GDP growth, real GDP for 2005 was only 13.4% higher than it was for 2000, which represents an average annual growth rate of only 2.55% &#8211; as compared to the 3.7% average growth from 1993 to 2000.  </p>
<p>I know Rudi has appointed himself to be head Bush cheerleading but seriously &#8211; I don&#8217;t know what he is so giddy about?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/06/waiting_for_a_p.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes <a href="http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users2&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB114946802518671112.html">Glenn Hubbard</a> that the pie is getting bigger.  As Mark notes, most of us will have to wait for our slice of that yummy pie.  While I might agree with Dr, Hubbard that the formerly expansionary monetary policy was a good thing, I’m a little shocked at his praise for Bush’s fiscal policy:<br />
<blockquote>And tax policy? Investment incentives, lower marginal tax rates and cuts in dividend and capital gains taxes promoted investment at a time when investment decisions faced many headwinds. Are we to believe that higher marginal tax rates would have led to better outcomes for output and employment over the past five years? Should we think that raising taxes on capital income would be an encouraging sign for foreign investors about the U.S. investment climate? </p></blockquote>
<p>Look – had this Administration cut government spending to go along with the reductions in marginal tax rates, he might have a point.  But as the economy is getting closer to full employment, the continued fiscal stimulus is forcing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates.  Can you say “crowding-out”?</p>

                                <p>Martin Feldstein writes in the WSJ (subscription required): <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114946588448771080.html">Tradeable Gasoline Rights</a>  </p>
<p>For excerpts, see Dr. Thoma: <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/06/tradeable_gas_r.html">Tradeable Gas Rights</a><br />
<blockquote>A far better approach would be a system of tradeable gasoline rights, or TGRs. These could be distributed in a way that actually raises the income of a majority of households while giving everyone an incentive to reduce gasoline consumption. </p>
<p>In a system of tradeable gasoline rights, the government would give each adult a TGR debit card. The gasoline pumps at service stations &#8230; would be modified to read these new TGR debit cards&#8230; Buying a gallon of gasoline would require using up one tradeable gasoline right as well as paying money. </p>
<p>The government would decide how many gallons of gasoline should be consumed per year and would give out that total number of TGRs. In 2006, Americans will buy about 110 billion gallons of gasoline. To keep that total unchanged in 2007, the government would distribute 110 billion TGRs. To reduce total gasoline consumption by 5%, it would cut the number of TGRs to 104.5 billion.<br />&#8230;<br />A key feature of these gasoline rights is that they are tradeable. Individuals with more TGRs than they need could sell the excess, while those who want to use more gallons than their allocation would have to buy extra TGRs.</p></blockquote>
<p> Professor Thoma is open to the idea, but <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/06/tradeable_gas_r.html">expresses</a> concern about how politics will intrude on the allocation of TGRs and on the cap.<br />
<blockquote>Would the cap on gasoline usage be as easy to lift as the debt limit? &#8230; [W]ill the credits per person be decided based upon political considerations rather than economics?  This may well be better than other proposals in a lot of dimensions and I am not opposed to it, but unless I missed something on the allocation part, it doesn&#8217;t seem so obvious that it would sail through congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Dr. DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/06/marty_feldstein.html">praises</a> the proposal:<br />
<blockquote>I think Marty&#8217;s right. I think it&#8217;s a clever idea&#8211;and much better than tightening CAFE.</p></blockquote>
<p>  I think this idea has merit, so its probably the last we will hear of it.  I&#8217;d suggest allocating the same number of TGRs to all registered drivers and letting the martketplace do its magic.  </p>
