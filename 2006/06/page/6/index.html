                                <p><a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/node/30416">Matthew</a> reads <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/02/opinion/02morris.html?_r=3&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">Charles Morris</a> confusing long-term growth with short-term business cycles:<br />
<blockquote>Historians long attributed the turmoil to a &#8220;great depression of the 1870&#8217;s.&#8221; But recent detailed reconstructions of 19th-century data by economic historians show that there was no 1870&#8217;s depression: aside from a short recession in 1873, in fact, the decade saw possibly the fastest sustained growth in American history. Employment grew strongly, faster than the rate of immigration; consumption of food and other goods rose across the board. On a per capita basis, almost all output measures were up spectacularly. By the end of the decade, people were better housed, better clothed and lived on bigger farms. Department stores were popping up even in medium-sized cities. America was transforming into the world&#8217;s first mass consumer society. But why did people feel so miserable? Partly they were confused by prices, which were dropping sharply. Farmers thought falling grain prices meant they were getting poorer, without noticing that the price of everything else was falling too. Farmers&#8217; terms of trade &#8211; the price differences between what they sold and what they bought &#8211; actually racked up solid gains in the 1870&#8217;s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Matthew seems to recall that a recession did occur during the 1870’s, which is not inconsistent with high overall growth for the decade.  We had two recessions during the 1950’s followed by one that began in 1960 &#8211; and yet the economy grew by 40% from 1950 to 1960.  <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">NBER</a> also argues there was a recession that started in 1873.</p>
<p>Matthew continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>One is that the author says people &#8220;were confused by prices, which were dropping sharply. Farmers thought falling grain prices meant they were getting poorer, without noticing that the price of everything else was falling too.&#8221; First off, I find it a little hard to believe that someone wouldn&#8217;t notice falling prices for the things they buy regularly. It seems like the kind of thing you would notice. But more to the point, how could prices have been falling in the context of rapid economic growth? As we all know, when the Fed decides it wants to reduce inflation (i.e., slow down the growth in prices) it raises interest rates to try and reduce economic growth. That&#8217;s because inflation is connected to growth &#8211; very fast growth leads to inflation. How could rapid growth have been paired with deflation? Perhaps there&#8217;s an answer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Should we suggest that Matthew read Milton Friedman’s “The Role of Monetary Policy: Presidential Address to AEA”, American Economic Review (1968)? Actually, Matthew is challenging the entire premise of adaptive expectations as did the new classical types who emphasized rational expectations.  I never bought into the premise of market clearing models of business cycles anyway.  Just call me an old fashioned Keynesian.  </p>
<p>But back the 1870’s – Matthew might enjoy <a href="http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.cgi?path=31882876520888">The Crisis of 1873</a> by David Glasner as well as the other entries in Business Cycles and Depressions: An Encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Also note that <a href="http://eh.net/hmit/gdp/GDPsource.htm">Economic History Series</a> provides a series that does indicate that real GDP in 1880 was 63% higher than it was in 1870 but they caution:</p>
<blockquote><p>A central point to keep in mind is that the quality of the data deteriorates the farther back in time one goes. The reason for this is simple: GDP data were not collected or even defined before the 1930s and thus any measures for years before 1932 rely on sources that were not collected for the purpose of constructing national income and product accounts.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13124918">Thomas Ricks</a> reports on the coverup of Haditha:<br />
<blockquote>Despite what Marine witnesses saw when they arrived, that official version has been allowed to stand for six months. Who lied about the killings, who knew the truth and what, if anything, they did about it are at the core of one of the potentially most embarrassing and damaging events of the Iraq war, one that some say may surpass the detainee abuse scandal at Abu Ghraib prison &#8230; That same month, a top military official arrived in Iraq who would play a key role in the case: Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, the new No. 2 military officer in the country &#8230; Not long after Chiarelli arrived in Baghdad, an Iraqi journalism student gave an Iraqi human rights group a video he had taken in Haditha the day after the incident. It showed the scene at the local morgue and the damage in the houses where the killings took place. The video reached Time magazine, whose reporters began questioning U.S. military officials. Pool, the Marine captain, sent the reporters a dismissive e-mail saying that they were falling for al-Qaeda propaganda, the magazine said recently. &#8220;I cannot believe you&#8217;re buying any of this,&#8221; he wrote. Pool declined last week to comment on any aspect of the Haditha incident. But Army Lt. Col. Barry Johnson, a more senior spokesman in Baghdad, notified Chiarelli of the questions. The general&#8217;s response to his public affairs office was short: Just brief the Time magazine reporter on the military investigation into the incident that Chiarelli assumed had been conducted. The surprising word came back: There had been no investigation. Chiarelli told subordinates in early February he was amazed by that response, according to an Army officer in Iraq. He directed that an inquiry commence as soon as possible. He wanted to know what had happened in Haditha, and also why no investigation had begun &#8230; On March 10, the findings were given to Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Gen. Peter Pace, the first Marine ever to be chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Rumsfeld told aides that the case promised to be a major problem. He called it &#8220;really, really bad &#8211; as bad or worse than Abu Ghraib,&#8221; recalled one Pentagon official. On March 11, President Bush was informed, according to the White House … The first public indication that the military was taking those allegations seriously came on April 7, when Lt. Col. Jeffrey R. Chessani, a reserved, quietly professional officer from northwestern Colorado, was relieved of command of the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Marines, Kilo Company&#8217;s parent unit. Also removed were two of his subordinates &#8211; Kilo&#8217;s commander, Capt. Luke McConnell, and the commander of another company. Even then, the Marine Corps didn&#8217;t specify why the actions were taken, beyond saying that the officers had lost the confidence of their superiors. Then, on May 17, Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.) let the news slip out. In the middle of a rambling statement at the outset of a news conference on Capitol Hill, he said &#8211; almost as an aside &#8211; that what happened in Haditha was &#8220;much worse than reported in Time magazine.&#8221; He asserted that the investigations would reveal that &#8220;our troops overreacted because of the pressure on them, and they killed innocent civilians in cold blood.&#8221; … The facts of the shooting incident seem now to be largely known, with military insiders saying that recent news articles are similar to the internal reports they have received from investigators. But considerable mystery remains about how Marine commanders handled the incident and contributed to what some officials suspect was a coverup. &#8220;The real issue is how far up the chain of command it goes,&#8221; said one senior Marine familiar with the case. &#8220;Who knew it, and why didn&#8217;t they do something about it?&#8221; The Marine Corps still has not corrected its misleading Nov. 20 statement asserting that the Iraqi civilians were killed in a bomb blast. A Marine Corps spokesman didn&#8217;t return calls on Friday asking why it had not.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I had thought the debate over My Lai was seared in my memory, I learned quite a bit from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Lai_massacre">Wikipedia</a> coverage of the massacre that occurred on March 16, 1968 and the subsequent cover-up.  First, the date – which was before Richard Nixon succeeded Lyndon Johnson.  One of my tenth grade teachers liked to turn his students loose debating the hot topics of the day and when My Lai came up, I was instantly the most unpopular person in class as I tried to argue that the prosecution of Lt. Calley should go forward.  I was not surprised that the hawks generally wanted no investigation – with the notable exception of some William Buckley wannabe who agreed with me on this particular issue (he never agreed with me on anything else).  I was generally surprised that the doves wanted to excuse Calley’s actions as they had blood lust for Nixon.  So how was it that we heard about My Lai only after Nixon become President.  Wikipedia details the cover-up:</p>
<blockquote><p>Henderson interviewed several soldiers involved in the incident, then issued a written report in late April claiming that approximately 22 civilians were inadvertently killed during the military operation in My Lai &#8230; Six months later, a 21-year-old soldier of the 11th Light Infantry (The Butcher&#8217;s Brigade) named Tom Glen wrote a letter accusing the Americal Division (and other entire units of the U.S. military, not just individuals) of routine brutality against Vietnamese civilians; the letter was detailed, its allegations horrifying, and its contents echoed complaints received from other soldiers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Next comes a familiar name – Colin Powell – who was the army major charged with looking into what Glen wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Powell wrote: &#8220;In direct refutation of this portrayal is the fact that relations between American soldiers and the Vietnamese people are excellent.&#8221; Later, Powell&#8217;s refutation would be called an act of &#8220;white-washing&#8221; the news of My Lai, and questions would continue to remain undisclosed to the public.</p></blockquote>
<p>The story continues with a letter from Ron Ridenhour, which he sent in early 1969 to President Nixon, the State Department, the Pentagon, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and several members of Congress. Most recipients of Ridenhour&#8217;s letter ignored it, with the notable exception of Representative Morris Udall.  We also see another interesting name – Seymour Hersch – who wrote a November 12, 1969 article letting the public know of this massacre.  </p>
<p>Some apologists for the Haditha incident are noting that we are not covering-up this massacre in the same fashion that we covered-up My Lai.  But there was an attempt at a cover-up even if this one failed sooner than the cover-up back in the late 1960’s.  Just as Richard Nixon knew about My Lai by March 1969 but did not tell us, George W. Bush knew about Haditha by March 2006 but choose not to tell us.  There were heroes during My Lai and there may be heroes today.  Alas, the President of the United States was not a hero during either incident.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you are left with the impression that the dead bodies on the ground were massacred by our Marines, that is exactly what the Times intends &#8230; This must not stand. And the Times must not be allowed to make a covert correction without a public acknowledgement. The editors must apologize for this blatant smear.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gerard Baker combines apology with a smack down of Malkin:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m sorry you have jumped to the conclusion that this was a deliberate misrepresentation and the result of slanted journalism and sorrier that you have shared that view with your readers without any attempt to verify it &#8230; I&#8217;m personally offended both by the error on the Times website and by your association of me with what you call the intentional slander of US marines.</p></blockquote>
<p>Malkin continues with her spin that the press is just making Haditha up including a link to <a href="http://www.proteinwisdom.com/index.php?/weblog/entry/battle_for_the_narrative_of_haditha">Jeff Goldstein</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether the historical referent becomes My Lai or Jenin (or something in between) will depend upon the outcome of the investigation, of course; but, if the early analogies are any indication, one does get the creepy sense that many in the US media are kind of hoping for the former … Or maybe they just have a lot of unused file footage of My Lai lying around and don’t want to see it go to waste.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jeff and Michelle are hoping we are stupid enough to believe that the press just made the whole Haditha massacre up.  Pathetic!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YTBjMGQ0MzQxOTI1Yzk5ZjE1ODhmNzU3OWIzOTc4MjE=">Byron York</a> found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/imagepages/2006/06/03/business/20060603_CHARTS_GRAPHIC.html">this comparison</a> enlightening.  Of course, real GDP and employment growth under Snow’s tenure was as strong as it was under Rubin’s tenure.  Under Rubin’s tenure, the employment to population rose from 63% to 64.3%.  But then it dropped for the first 2.5 years of the Bush Administration and has now crawled back to 63%.  In terms of levels – rather than rates of change – Snow’s best period equals where Rubin’s worst.  </p>
<p>But let’s talk about the Federal debt/GDP ratio, which was 57.4% and declining when the Clinton Administration turned over the reigns to the Bush Administration.  When Rubin assumed the post of Treasury Secretary, it was 66.7% and is projected to reach that level again as a result of the fiscal fiasco that Snow bragged about.</p>
<p>Maybe Mr. York did not notice but Jimmy Carter’s first Treasury Secretary – Michael Blumental – presided over a period when growth averaged 4.8%.  Not listed was Henry Fowler who served as LBJ’s Treasury Secretary from 1965 to 1968 when real GDP growth averaged 5%.  And yet, York’s NRO colleagues think of Carter and LBJ as “economic morons”.</p>

<p>When <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/employment-update.html">Kash</a> delivered the disappointing news about how little employment growth we saw last month  &#8211; not to mention the weak increase in nominal hourly wages and the fall in the average workweek – I jokingly commented that the White House talking points would be about the 4.6% unemployment rate and the increase in the household survey figure.  And sure enough &#8211; <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MWI1M2NhZWFjZDY4NjQyNGU3Y2YyNDczMDY4MDZhZDA=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> comes through:<br />
<blockquote>You can’t win with the economic pessimists. The cult of the bear still reigns supreme in most corners of Wall Street and the mainstream media, as those who want to tear down the economy continue to manufacture justifications for their declinist American views. If jobs reports come in above expectations, the naysayers predict inflation. When they come in below, the pessimists predict recession.  So it was with Friday’s 75,000 increase in non-farm payrolls for May. That number was greeted derisively, despite the fact that over the past 33 consecutive months, 5.3 million new jobs have been created. Through the year ending in May, 1.9 million new jobs have been created with the unemployment rate moving down to 4.6 percent &#8211; the lowest rate in nearly five years and below the average of the last forty-five years. But wait &#8211; there’s even more good news being clouded out by the pessimist frowns: The Labor Department’s household survey, which focuses on self-employed owner-operators of new entrepreneurial businesses, showed a booming May jobs increase of 288,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow is still trying to tell us that this household survey figure is a more reliable indicator of the labor market than the payroll survey figure.  I’ll leave to others to remind Kudlow of all the problems with his spin on this one and simply remind everyone as to the time path of the employment to population ratio from 1998 to today – given the fact he remains unaware that part of the reason why the unemployment ratio is back down to 4.6% has to do with a decline the labor force participation rate. </p>
<p>The official version of the White House talking points can be found <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/06/20060602-1.html">here</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Today, The Government Released New Jobs Figures – 75,000 Jobs Created In May. The economy has created about 1.9 million jobs over the past 12 months &#8211; and more than 5.3 million since August 2003. The unemployment rate fell to 4.6 percent &#8211;  lower than the average of the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep – you don’t need good news when you have the ability to simply spin anything.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: I’m trying to figure out what Kudlow means by “The Labor Department’s household survey, which focuses on self-employed owner-operators of new entrepreneurial businesses”, which he seems to be saying represents the difference between the 288,000 increase in the household survey versus the 75,000 increase in the payroll survey – as if self employment rose by 213,000.  <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t05.htm">Table A-5</a> indicates an increase of only 40,000 as far as self-employed workers in the non-agricultural sector and a 47,000 decrease as far as self-employed workers in the agricultural sector.  It would seem to me that the BLS measure of self-employed workers fell by 7000 last month.  What am I missing here? Is there some other category or has Kudlow just made another bogus claim?  After all, there can be other reasons why these two surveys show differences in the reported increase in employment beyond the change in self-employed workers.  I would hope Kudlow would have figured that out by now.</p>
<p>Update II: AB reader <a href="http://www.blah3.com/article.php?story=20060602185242920">Invictus</a> provides this from David Rosenberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>To be sure, the Pollyannas will point to the fact that the Household Survey showed a far different headline than the nonfarm report did – +288k for the former as opposed to +75k for the latter. But don&#8217;t be fooled – that Household Survey also flagged softness beneath the veneer because all the gains were in part-time; full-time jobs actually plunged by 292k in May, which was the steepest decline since Feb/05.</p></blockquote>
<p>Full-time jobs did fall by 292,000 according to the seasonally adjusted figures while part-time jobs rose by 486,000 so that the latter rose from 17% to 17.3% of total reported employment per the household survey.  To be fair – the percent of employment from part-time jobs was 17.2% as of December 2000.  To add to the confusion that the Pollyannas spinmeisters might used &#8211; Kudlow might consider reporting the unadjusted figures where reported employment rose by 636,000 including a 334,000 increase in full-time jobs.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This morning the BLS released its estimate of <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">employment in May</a>.  The headline figure indicates that 75,000 new jobs were created in May, which is well below the expectations of closer to 175,000.  Those who were employed actually worked fewer hours in May, and nominal earnings were stagnant after rising at a reasonable pace for the past several months (this means that real earnings fell, of course).  All in all, this is a pretty lousy jobs report.</p>
<p>Does this provide evidence of a slowing economy?  We&#8217;ll need a few more months of weak job readings to tell for sure, but it&#8217;s definitely starting to look like a real possibility.  Take a look at the picture below, which shows the three-month average of net job growth in the private sector.  Clearly the trend over the past few months is not a good one.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/MyChart.jpg"></p>
<p>Manufacturing employment fell in May, and even hiring in the construction sector slowed substantially; over the last 3 month period only 18,000 new construction jobs were created, compared to 3-month totals that have typically been between 50 and 100 thousand since early 2003.  Chalk one up to the slowing housing market.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/31/AR2006053102043.html">Robert Nelson</a> argues that the AMT is like a flat tax and then argues this makes the AMT a good thing.  Since I’m late to this party, let me simply summarize a few good reactions starting with <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_05/008923.php">Kevin Drum</a>: <br />
<blockquote>As Nelson surely knows, there&#8217;s wide agreement among economists that a broadly-based tax that minimizes exemptions and loopholes would be economically efficient. However, there is no agreement at all that having a flat rate is a good thing. It&#8217;s wildly dishonest to say otherwise.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/06/flat_rate_rerun.html">Mark Thoma</a> notes that we Democrats might support getting rid of the subsidies that favor the rich and that any efficiency gains from a flat tax are being grossly exaggerated by Mr. Nelson.  </p>
<p>So all I might have hoped to add was to comment on Nelson’s spin about Social Security, but then <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/06/libeling-social-security.html">DeanSpeaks</a> so we listen:<br />
<blockquote>One of the disadvantages of having a public Social Security system is that people are free to make all sorts of untrue statements about it without facing any consequences. For example, an oped in the Washington Post this morning described the Social Security trust fund as “largely an accounting fiction.” This statement is of course absurd. The trust fund consists of U.S. government bonds, which the government is obligated to repay under the law. There is no sense whatsoever in which it can accurately be described as fictional.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m reduced to go after the obvious – NRO’s <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjYyMzdiMjZlMjg3Mjc1OTNjMmE5NzRmMjI0Y2E1Mzc=">Jerry Bowyer</a> who does not know the difference between income flows and wealth creation (ah, Jerry – savings is the portion of income we don’t consume) and confounds nominal with real changes.  He also makes odd statements such as:<br />
<blockquote>Even when adjusted downward somewhat for inflation, this aggregate jump in GDP is extremely large. The only larger spikes in modern time came during the bubble years at the end of the Clinton administration and the 2002-05 time period.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess he is referring to the 5.3% annualized growth rate for the first quarter of 2006, which was less than the 6.2% growth rate for 1997QII, the 6.7% growth rate for 1996QII, the 5.5% growth rate for 1993QIV, and the 5.4% growth rate for 1988QIV, etc.  But OK, Ronald Reagan’s term as President must have been during the feudal era.  </p>
<p>But the oddest oped I’ve seen today comes from an attack on Senator Schumer by <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTA5OTU1NGZjMDNmODJlOGJkY2I3ZjRiYzJjMzM2N2U=">Phil Kerpen</a>:<br />
<blockquote>For the sake of the American economy, and their own political fortunes, Democrats should disregard Schumer’s fiscal shortsightedness &#8230; According to the most recent data compiled by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average wage earner in the U.S. in 2005 earned about $27,000 and paid a total effective tax rate, including federal, state, and local taxes, of 30 percent.  Americans are not under-taxed. Yet Democrats like Schumer would do nothing to stop the largest tax hike in American history, which is scheduled to occur over the next five years. They would prefer to hike taxes even sooner &#8230; It’s the American people, not the pro-tax Democrats, who have the facts on their side.</p></blockquote>
<p>The fact that Mr. Kerpen ignores is the elephant in the room – the massive Federal deficit which means Americans are already facing growing deferred tax liabilities.  Democrats like Senator Schumer simply want policymakers to convert deferred taxation into current taxation, that is, to stop the explosion in Federal debt.  We are not proposing to put this tax burden on the average wage earners – but many Republicans would.  The problem is that these Republican politicians and the hacks that support them – such as those who write for the National Review – simply don’t have the integrity to say so.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2006/06/amt_as_a_stealth_flat_tax">James Joyner</a> adds to the debate over the AMT as a substitute for a flat tax:<br />
<blockquote>First, no Republican that I know of advocates a flat tax in the 26-28 percent range; most talk about one between 10 to 15 percent. For the federal government to take over a quarter of one’s income off the top, with no deductions, is confiscatory. Second, one can simultaneoulsy [simultaneously] think a policy a good idea and oppose doing it covertly. The AMT’s critics find it outrageous that we set up a system encouraging people to make certain economic decisions–buying a house, making charitable donations, investing in education, an so forth–and then have a backdoor trap wherein those benefits are stripped after the money has been spent &#8230; So, the lure isn’t so much a flat tax but a massive tax hike. And the worst kind, at that: One ena[c]ted by the vagaries of inflation rather than by the direct action of the elected representatives of the people.</p></blockquote>
<p>And yes – I left off Joyner’s feed the beast last sentence.  This Democrat wants to see a tax increase and restraint on Federal spending.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (<a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/index.asp">OFHEO</a>) released its quarterly report on house prices in the US.  The national view is summed up thusly:<br />
<blockquote>U.S. home prices were 12.54 percent higher in the first quarter of 2006 than they were one year earlier. Appreciation for the most recent quarter was 2.03 percent, or an annualized rate of 8.12 percent. The quarterly rate is about one percentage point below the rate from the previous quarter and is the lowest rate since the first quarter of 2004. The figures were released today by OFHEO Acting Director James Lockhart, as part of the House Price Index (HPI), a quarterly report analyzing housing price appreciation trends.</p>
<p>“These data show average housing prices still growing stronger than some might have expected,” said Lockhart. “They do indicate, however, that price growth is moderating in some parts of the country, particularly in areas where prices have been rising the most.”</p>
<p>House prices continued to grow considerably faster over the past year than did prices of non-housing goods and services reflected in the Consumer Price Index. House prices rose 12.5 percent, while prices of other goods and services rose only 4.2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Different housing markets in the US are behaving very, very differently, however, so discussion about the national average hides a lot of interesting detail.  In some places house prices started showing signs of unusual increases as far back as 2002, other places didn&#8217;t begin their upward sprint until 2005, and many parts of the US have completely missed out on the Great Appreciation of the 2000s.</p>
<p>The data tends to show that in those cities which saw the most rapid increases in house prices during the period 2003-05 (generally in the Northeast and California), house prices are starting to stabilize.  The following graph shows the annualized rate of growth in house prices from September 2005 through March 2006, as measured by OFHEO&#8217;s House Price Index.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/hpi_06a.jpg"></p>
<p>Some of the recent decline in the rate of house price appreciation may be due to seasonal factors, but it seems quite clear that there&#8217;s also a gradual slowing of the rate of growth.  Note, however, that with the exception of perhaps Boston and San Diego, even the frothiest cities still registered quite respectable price appreciation during the end of 2005 and beginning of 2006.</p>
<p>One last question that I&#8217;ll throw out for readers familiar with the California real estate markets: does anyone have a good explanation for the recent striking divergence between the San Diego and Los Angeles real estate markets?  Typically those markets move very closely together (which is quite natural since they&#8217;re physically not very far apart), but over the past year the San Diego market has slowed dramatically while the Los Angeles market continues to appreciate at a rapid rate.  Any theories?</p>
<p>All in all, this data confirms what other data have suggested for the past several months: the housing market in many parts of the US is slowing, but only gradually.</p>
