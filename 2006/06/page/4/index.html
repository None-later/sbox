                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/commentary/areynolds.htm">Alan Reynolds</a> suggests:<br />
<blockquote>Aside from that odd remark about what some nameless supply-siders like to claim, Mr. Mankiw simply restated what real supply-siders did claim. He emphasized that higher (marginal) tax rates reduce work effort and cause other inefficient distortions. He added that higher tax rates also reduce the tax base: People respond to higher tax rates by taking it easy or figuring out ways to report less taxable income. This used to be called “the Laffer Curve” but now goes by the more respectable name of “taxable income elasticity.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I’d be fine with this suggestion – just so we are talking about fiscally neutral changes in fiscal policy.  I trust Mr. Reynolds also realizes what Greg Mankiw and I tend to agree on – there is indeed a crowding-out effect when certain politicians (say Ronald Reagan or George W. Bush) try to promise a free lunch where one can cut taxes without cutting government spending.  Mr. Reynolds continues with something that is simply not true:<br />
<blockquote>No economist ever claimed all taxes are so distortionary that increasing any tax rate would reduce revenue. Art Laffer never said that. Bob Mundell never said that. Larry Lindsey, Larry Kudlow, Paul Craig Roberts, Steve Entin and Bruce Bartlett never said that. I never said that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Mundell, Bartlett, or Reyonlds never said there was a free lunch.  I don’t know Steven Entin but I do know Lawrence Kudlow and Art Laffer have often implied a free lunch.  Reynolds may grow weary of people accusing him of practicing free lunch economics, but I grow weary of the Lafferites one day saying there is a free lunch and then the next day denying what they just said.</p>

                                <p>Is <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MWUwZjZmNDVlNDg4ZGIxZDc4YTUzMjRmY2M5NzBkMjA">John Tamny</a> trying to discourage me from purchasing a copy of <a href="http://www.greenwood.com/books/printFlyer.aspx?sku=C2023">The Financial Analysts Guide to Monetary Policy</a> by Victor A. Canto, Charles W. Kadlec, and Arthur B. Laffer?  Well he has succeeded by blaming the following confusion on the authors:<br />
<blockquote>Is there a Laffer curve component to all this? Writing in the early 1980s, economists Arthur Laffer, Charles Kadlec, and Victor Canto alluded to such a possibility, noting that rate hikes “represent an increase in the effective tax rate on the activity levels of Federal Reserve member banks.” Rate increases back then “undermined the utility of the dollar as an intermediary currency,” meaning rate hikes “diminished demand for dollars,” which was itself inflationary.  Though yields on 3-month Treasury bills reached 16 percent in 1981, the rate of inflation rose substantially.</p></blockquote>
<p>For some reason – the National Review is opposing the recent tight monetary policy from the Federal Reserve on the fear that higher interest rates will actually increase inflation.  Now I’m hoping the Federal Reserve loosens its monetary policy as I fear it might lead to another recession – albeit I can understand the FED’s concern that fiscal stimulus is still out of control.   Yes, Laffer would tell you that tax cuts, which leads to less savings if people consume more, don’t crowd out investment, but he’s wrong.  </p>
<p>Let’s try to follow Tamny’s “logic”.  An inward shift of the money supply curve raises the price of credit (the interest rate) which lowers the quantity demand for money.  Now if one was drunk during the first lecture in Economics 101, one might have imagined that the money demand curve shifted inward.  And an inward shift of the money demand curve would increase aggregate demand etc.  But once one sobered up and re-read the textbook – one would realize how utterly stupid Tamny’s thesis really is.  Now if Canto, Kadlec, and Laffer are actually including the insane musings of a drunken fool in a Guide to Monetary Policy, I’m not wasting my time or money on it.  </p>
<p>Incidentally, the tight monetary policy during the early 1980&#8217;s did lower inflation despite the fiscal stimulus from the 1981 tax cut &#8211; which did lead to crowding-out of investment and slower long-term growth.  Something else a drunk might never realize as listens to Laffer&#8217;s BS and thinks it&#8217;s real economics.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Mr. Tamny’s most recent comment (1:30 PM) now says money demand rose whereas his op-ed talked about a decrease in money demand.  Before that – he notes that tight monetary policy does not lower inflation as it does not lead to dollar appreciation.  Let me assure Mr. Tamny that the tight monetary policies of the early 1980’s lead to a substantial appreciation of the dollar.  I’m sorry but Mr. Tamny is utterly confused as to the facts as well as what he wrote.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Many thanks to David Altig for reminding us of the <a href="http://econ.ucsd.edu/papers/files/2000-08.pdf">Wright Patman effect</a>.  The particular paper that I’ve linked to has as part of its summary:<br />
<blockquote>This paper has presented an empirical test that provides evidence to support the contention that monetary policy has supply-side effects on real variables. The evidence given here shows that in key manufacturing industries, prices rise and output falls following an unanticipated monetary contraction, even after controlling for both the price puzzle and the cost effects of oil shocks. Further, the results call into question whether a price puzzle even exists. We find that the evidence for cost channel effects is much stronger during the period from 1959 to 1979 than from 1983 to 1996. </p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002282.html">Max Sawicky</a> reads an interesting <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/09/AR2006060901775.html">article</a> but argues that it missed the most interesting point.  First, a summary of the article:<br />
<blockquote>Indiana is about to turn over its entire toll road for the next 75 years to two foreign companies, making it more expensive to drive.  The decision to hand the Indiana Toll Road to an Australian and Spanish team for $3.8 billion at the end of this month has blown up into one of the biggest brawls here in a generation. It has unsettled the state&#8217;s politics in the months before the November elections, pitting a governor who was President Bush&#8217;s first budget director against the people of northern Indiana, which the highway passes through &#8230; The decision also places Indiana at the leading edge of a nascent trend in which states and local governments are exploring the idea of privatizing parts of the United States&#8217; prized interstate highway system. The idea goes beyond projects, such as Northern Virginia&#8217;s Dulles Greenway, in which states have turned to private companies to build or widen toll roads. Now, they are considering selling or leasing some of the best-known and most-traveled routes across America.  The trend started 1 1/2 years ago, when Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley (D) pushed through a 99-year lease of the Chicago Skyway, nearly eight miles of elevated highway across the South Side, for $1.8 billion. Since then, a New Jersey lawmaker has proposed selling a 49 percent interest in the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway. New York Gov. George E. Pataki (R) is trying to persuade the legislature to let investors rebuild or replace the Hudson River&#8217;s Tappan Zee Bridge. In Houston, Harris County officials are studying leasing 57 miles of toll roads.</p></blockquote>
<p>Max argues:<br />
<blockquote>When a government takes a lump sum in exchange for permitting a private firm to manage a road and levy tolls, it is not only privatizing. It is borrowing, worsening its fiscal position. Most states are looking at growing budget shortfalls in the future, as Medicaid costs in particular continue to grow more rapidly than their revenues. The Gov could just as easily contract out operations and management, but keep the tolls for itself. The fact that the money is earmarked to new projects &#8211; investment &#8211; is irrelevant. It&#8217;s still borrowing. You could just as easily keep the roads and float a bond &#8211; also borrowing &#8211; for the new projects. The leasing is not necessary. The political onus against explicit borrowing can warp decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me play a bit of devil’s advocate for a moment.  Is it possible the $3.8 billion received by the state of Indiana covers the present value of the foregone toll revenues?  We are talking about the lease versus buy issue, which is analogous to switching from traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs (getting a early big bang of tax revenue but sacrificing taxes in the future).  </p>
<p>Max reader Rich goes one step further and argues that the Federal deduction allows the local government to have a reduced cost of capital.  Tax professionals have been pushing SILO or sale-in, lease-out transactions, which involve assets owned by municipal entities.  Lee Sheppard described these plays in a February 25, 2004 article for Tax Analysts:<br />
<blockquote>Most of the New York and Chicago subway cars and fare card machines have been sold to corporate tax shelter customers and leased back to public transit authorities in SILO deals. Customers include Altria Group (formerly Philip Morris) and Textron Inc. Thankfully, however, the New York subways are still being run by the Metropolitan Transit Authority, and not by America&#8217;s preeminent cigarette manufacturer. What&#8217;s wrong with a SILO if the transit authority gets financing? Defenders of SILO deals argue that they are a cheap way for a transit authority to get financing for its system. The Bush administration argues that the transit systems never get their hands on any funds because of defeasance. The transit authority&#8217;s fee for participating in the deal can be as little as 4 to 6 percent of the value placed on the property, which may be far in excess of its fair market value. Because the corporate shelter customer hopes to recover the entire value of the property in a short time in the form of depreciation deductions, it gets the lion&#8217;s share of the benefits. The SILO transaction features an outright sale coupled with a short 12-year to 20-year sublease. (A 99-year head lease could be used if local law does not permit a sale; when the term of the head lease exceeds the useful life of the property, it is considered a sale.) So the corporate tax shelter customer becomes the tax owner of the property and deducts depreciation on it, in addition to interest on any borrowing for the purchase. </p></blockquote>
<p>On November 26, 2003, Pamela Olson – Assistant Secretary of Treasury – wrote to Norman Mineta who was the Secretary of Transportation about these transactions arguing that the costs to the U.S. Treasury exceeded the benefits to local governments.  </p>
<p>Dean Thomas Riskas – representing the leasing industry – challenged Ms. Olson’s claim by discussing the economics of leasing in a Daily Tax Report article dated April 12, 2004 with the following logic:<br />
<blockquote>The lessee sells an asset to the lessor for a purchase price equal to 100 percent of the asset&#8217;s current fair market value &#8230; The lessor leases the asset back to the lessee, who pays rent to the lessor during the lease term. The rent is more than sufficient to repay the loan and, when combined with the asset&#8217;s residual value (the expected FMV of the asset at the expiration of the lease), always generates a profit for the lessor.  Importantly, the lease is profitable to the lessor without regard to tax benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the lessor (which in our discussion is one of these foreign firms) is presumably receiving a return on its investment in excess of the normal return to the assets that it purchased.  If that were the case, then Max’s claim that the local government worsened its long-run fiscal position is correct as the benefits to the private sector exceed the cost to the U.S. Treasury, which is an even more damning claim that Ms. Olson was making.  At other times, the representatives of the leasing industry claim that the local governments receive at least a portion of the benefits from ripping off the U.S. Treasury.  </p>
<p>But their claims have so many bait and switch games embedded in the financial analysis, it is hard to tell which version best approximates the real world deals.  From the point of view of local government financing, which is what Max is focusing one, it all comes down to whether the present value of tolls along the Indiana roads over the next 75 years will be greater than or less than the $3.8 billion upfront payment.  Max is suggesting that the present value of the tolls exceed the $3.8 billion, but why would a government make such a dumb deal?  As Max says, the political onus of borrowing can warp decisions.  This is sort of like the Enron financing that has permeated Congress and the White House for the past five years.  And his original OMB director is now Indiana’s governor.</p>
<p>But I don’t want to sound like I’m Bush bashing as I think Ms. Olson has exactly the right idea here – for several reasons.  I just hope her political bosses are supporting her efforts.</p>

In the meantime, <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/06/14/boehner-memo">ThinkProgress</a> exposes the confidential strategy memo from Boehner’s office:<br />
<blockquote>Here’s a quick summary:<br />1. Exploit 9/11. The two page memo mentions 9/11 seven times. It describes debating Iraq in the context of 9/11 as “imperative.”<br />2. Attack opponents ad hominem. The memo describes those who opposes President Bush’s policies in Iraq as “sheepish,” “weak,” and “prone to waver endlessly.”<br />3. Create a false choice. The memo says the decision is between supporting President Bush’s policies and hoping terrorist threats will “fade away on their own.” </p></blockquote>
<p>These dishonest demagogues never case.  Incidentally, even a sheep knows that Saddam Hussein is not Osama bin Laden and a few are smart enough to know that the decision on March 19, 2003 to invade Iraq helped revived Al Qaeda.  But I guess sheep are smarter than Congressman Boehner.</p>

                                <p>Has Karl Rove hired <a href="http://www.investors.com/editorial/IBDArticles.asp?artsec=5&#038;issue=20060612&#038;view=1">Jed Graham</a> as the new spinmeister:<br />
<blockquote>Aided by surging tax receipts, President Bush may make good on his pledge to cut the deficit in half in 2006 &#8211; three years early. Tax revenues are running $176 billion, or 12.9%, over last year, the Treasury Department said Monday. The Congressional Budget Office said receipts have risen faster over the first eight months of fiscal &#8217;06 than in any other such period over the past 25 years &#8211; except for last year&#8217;s 15.5% jump &#8230; While gains are broad, those at higher-income levels are enjoying bigger salary hikes. Because they pay higher rates, federal tax revenues soar when they do well.  Those making over $200,000 now pay 46.6% of total income taxes, presidential adviser Karl Rove recently said. That&#8217;s up from 40.5% &#8211; despite Bush&#8217;s tax cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>That the very rich pay a large share in taxes simply reflects they receive a large share of the nation’s income.  But it’s this comparison of nominal tax revenues for a portion of this fiscal year v. a portion of the previous fiscal year is misleading for several reasons – two related to variability and two related to long-term growth.</p>
<p>On the former – consider our graph of nominal tax revenues.  We have discussed several times the fact that the U.S. economy was bound to eventually recovery from the 2001 recession.  But also notice that there was a temporary dip in tax revenues during the middle part of 2005.  </p>

<p>One might be tempted to say that nominal tax revenues in 2006QI were 15% higher than they were in 2001QI.  But check out our second graph, which shows tax revenues fell relative to nominal GDP.  Part of the reason for this decline relates to the fact that the price-level was 12.8% higher in 2006QI than it was in 2001QI.  Alas, average real GDP growth has been rather anemic over the past 5 years. </p>

<p>One would have hoped that Investor’s Business Daily would have better reporting on the economy that we get from <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzU3MzI3MzBiMDNjOTRkMjA5MjMwYzU1YmEwN2M2N2Y=">this</a> <a href="http://instapundit.com/archives/030890.php">crowd</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/06/20060614.html">President Bush</a> answered a question about inflation thusly:<br />
<blockquote>On fiscal policy, though, I would strongly urge the Congress to recognize why we have grown the way we have grown, why we&#8217;re &#8212; have got strong economic growth in the first quarter of this year, why we&#8217;ve added over 5 million new jobs in a &#8211; in two-and-three-quarters years, and that&#8217;s because the tax cuts are working, and they need to make the tax cuts permanent. Pro-growth economic policies work. And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve been calling for permanence in the tax code. And so there will be monetary policy &#8211; we&#8217;ll pay attention very carefully to signs, inflationary signs. That&#8217;s Ben Bernanke&#8217;s job. Our job is to work with Congress to have wise fiscal policy. And wise fiscal policy means not only keeping revenues low, but it also means being wise about how we spend the people&#8217;s money.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right – the President’s stated goal is to not have tax revenue growth, which means high deficits forever.  And by telling Bernanke that fiscal policy will remain reckless, the path to low inflation requires higher interest rates, which of course reduces investment and long-term growth.  But if we have permanent deficits as the President just promised – Sargent &#038; Wallace’s Unpleasant Monetarist Arithmetic suggests that the FED will have a very difficult job in controlling inflation.</p>
<p>Maybe the President is simply following the advice of <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGU3OGM1YmUyOWQxM2JlOGYzYzM1YzhlYjdkMGUzYjI=">Peter Ferrara</a> who opposes the efforts of the Entitlements Commission to have a balanced reduction in government spending along with tax increases.  Sad.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update II</strong></em>: Judd at <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/06/14/will-bush-cut-the-deficit-in-half-this-year-only-in-fantasy-land">Thinkprogress</a> is tracking the rightwing bloggers who are crowing about the Investor’s Business Daily spin:<br />
<blockquote>It shows a lot about the state of fiscal discipline in the conservative movement that these kind of numbers are cause for celebration. </p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.senatemajority.com/node/381">Christy Setzer</a> is emailing the latest smear of certain veterans from Karl Rove (good thing as the website seems to be down):<br />
<blockquote>Never one to let the facts or delicious irony stand in the way of a vicious political smear, today Karl Rove took a swipe at war heros Sen. John Kerry and Rep. John Murtha, stating, &#8220;They may be with you for the first few bullets but they won&#8217;t be there for the last tough battles.&#8221; Rove, of course, never served in battle, dodging the draft for nearly three years of the Vietnam War. He&#8217;s in good company, though &#8211; the Vice President received five deferments from going into battle himself. &#8220;Unfortunately for the American military, Dick Cheney, Karl Rove and their merry band of draft-dodgers won&#8217;t be with you for the first few bullets, the last tough battles, or anywhere along the way,&#8221; said Christy Setzer, Communications Director, Senate Majority Project.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Karl is feeling his oats after reading <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/13/rove.cia/index.html">this story</a>:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (CNN) &#8211; White House senior adviser Karl Rove has been told by special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald that he will not be charged in the CIA leak case, according to Robert Luskin, Rove&#8217;s lawyer. &#8220;In deference to the pending case, we will not make any further public statements about the subject matter of the investigation,&#8221; Luskin said in a written statement Tuesday. &#8220;We believe that the special counsel&#8217;s decision should put an end to the baseless speculation about Mr. Rove&#8217;s conduct.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice CNN did not say whether Robert Luskin got a phone call or a letter from Patrick Fitzgerald and is basically refusing to give any real details.   And even though Mr. Luskin has been spinning ever since the inquiry began, the folks over at <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NWM2ZjY3YzZkMTA1YzEyODBiZmE2ZGQ0MjhlM2RmNjc=">NRO’s Corner</a> has engaged in what appears to be premature celebration. </p>
<p>For some very good reasons why those supporting the traitors within the White House might wish to stop gloating, see <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/06/13/hey-bob-wheres-your-letter">Jane Hamsher</a>.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.prospect.org/horsesmouth">Greg Sargent</a> discusses today’s news with Rove attorney Mark Corallo:<br />
<blockquote>Corallo said this: &#8220;There were no conditions attendant to the prosecutor&#8217;s actions. There never has been any discussion about cooperation or conditions or anything of the sort. This strictly reflects the prosecutor coming to the correct conclusion that Rove has told the truth from day one. He believed him.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NTE5MzJhNWNlZWU1YTUxZjQ2M2JhNGExZmE3MzMyNDY=">Byron York</a> trusts every word out of Carallo’s mouth:<br />
<blockquote>I just talked to defense spokesman Mark Corallo, who told me, &#8220;There are no conditions to this action by the special prosecutor.  There has never been any talk of conditions, of cooperation, of anything that could even be construed as conditions.  This just simply reflects the fact that the special prosecutor found Mr. Rove to be a truthful and credible witness from the beginning.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Corallo is at least consistent in how he spins this.  But I seriously doubt that Patrick Fitzgerald believed what Karl Rove said during his early appearances before the Grand Jury – so excuse me for saying that it would appear that Corallo is full of it – again.</p>
<p>In the meantime, leave poor <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODI5YzRjZjQ0Njg2N2QzMmE2OWJkMzhhMmI2NGY5MmE=">Jonah Goldberg</a> alone on this issue – as he has enough <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZDk4NWRkZmRjYjQ2OGMzMWM3MTZiYzZiMjRkZWZlMDg=">trouble</a> with another <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZDQwNjQ4OWM5MjI1ZDExMWQ4MDNlZDFjYzJlYzIxYmQ=">NRO post</a> that called Mr. Goldberg for his smears on our <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTEzOGQxMGU5NDhkMDVlZmZiMjg4M2ExYjA3ODZkNWI=">neighbors to the north</a>.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update II</strong></em>: <a href="http://citizenspook.blogspot.com/2006/06/strong-indications-rove-has-been.html#links">CitizenSpook</a> is running some odd “sealed vs. sealed” claim about Rove actually being indicted under case # 06 cr 128.  Google 06 cr 128 and you get <a href="http://patrickjfitzgerald.blogspot.com/2006/05/sealed-v-sealed-may-17th-grand-jury.html">these</a> <a href="http://patrickjfitzgerald.blogspot.com/">two hits</a>.   Did I say odd?  Maybe I should say weird.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/06/mccain-on-economic-challenges_13.html">Greg Mankiw</a> comes John McCain’s speech to the <a href="http://mccain.senate.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=NewsCenter.ViewPressRelease&#038;Content_id=1750">Economic Club of New York</a>.  Greg really liked what Senator McCain said.  Maybe he’s hoping to be McCain’s economic advisor on the hope that a President McCain would be more willing to listen to his advice than George W. Bush did.</p>
<p>Let me start with where I also agree with Senator McCain:<br />
<blockquote>A global rising tide of protectionism and a retreat from market-based economic policy is threatening the entrepreneurs of developed and developing countries alike. Free trade is the key to global economic growth, and a key to U.S. economic success. We need stand up for free trade with no ifs, ands or buts about it. We let trade and globalization be politicized at our own peril.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, President Bush also preaches free trade as he uses trade protection for political purposes.  McCain is also rightfully worried about the long-term fiscal deficit created by the President that Greg used to work for:<br />
<blockquote>A tsunami of entitlement spending is threatening our economy, while providing no real security to retirees. We have made promises that we cannot keep &#8230; Our workers make their retirement plans based on promised benefits that cannot be paid even if we burden our children with crippling taxes. If we fix the system now, people will have time to plan accordingly, to ensure that they still have a comfortable retirement. If we wait, we make the problem worse and, in effect, lie to Americans who we encouraged to put their trust in a broken system. I have long supported supplementing the current Social Security system with personal accounts – but not as a substitute for addressing benefit promises that cannot be kept. People of good faith in both parties agree that we must make the hard decisions to restore solvency to these programs and that personal accounts can ease the impact of slower benefit growth &#8230; But the answer to these deficits is not to raise new taxes or repeal tax cuts but to restrain our spending habits. If the federal government can’t be funded with current revenues than we must reduce its size.</p></blockquote>
<p>The best that can be said about these claims is that Senator McCain is not arguing there is some magical free lunch.  But he is flat wrong that moving to personal accounts will solve the deficit problem.  He is also wrong that the Social Security system is broken.  Rather it’s the General Fund that is in massive deficit as Greg’s former boss promised massive tax cuts and a prescription drug benefit. Finally, the Senator is wrong about not being able to pay for the prescription drug benefit with tax increases.  But at least the Senator is not trying to sell us that we can have our cake and eat it too, which Greg’s former boss is still saying.</p>

<blockquote>On Meet the Press, Tim Russert noted that National Review White House correspondent Byron York is &#8220;a conservative writer,&#8221; but then added that York is &#8220;an interesting, objective observer of American politics,&#8221; without elaborating on the term &#8220;objective.&#8221; Media Matters for America has documented numerous instances of conservative misinformation from York.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if one did not know anything about York’s past misstatements, following his attempt to smear Markos Moulitsas on <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13189411">Sunday’s show</a> would have given one a clear indication of the garbage that York is infamous for:<br />
<blockquote>Now, the problem is, is that we don’t really know how representative they are of the entire Democratic coalition. For example, black voters are a huge part of the Democratic coalition, and Internet activists are overwhelmingly white &#8230; But, you know, as far as the, the strength of the so-called net roots, a writer a while back called Markos Moulitsas a king-maker, to which another blogger, Mickey Kaus, replied, “Yeah? Name the king.” The fact is, is that they &#8211; Markos and the Daily Kos has lent its support to more than a dozen candidates in the past couple of years and none of them have won &#8230; in Connecticut where they’re, they’re supporting Ned Lamont against Senator Joseph Lieberman. And if you were out here at the convention, you almost got the sense that they would rather defeat Lieberman in a primary than the Republican candidate in the fall.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the really interesting thing about this transcript is not the childish behavior of Byron York or the goofy comment from Tim Russert but rather it was the very professional and able manner in which Markos Moulitsas handled himself.  Which reminds me – I should pay more attention to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/">his blog</a>.</p>

<blockquote>What was the relationship between Saddam Hussein&#8217;s inner circle and Islamic terrorists? A newly released document appears to provide evidence that in 1999 the Taliban welcomed &#8220;Islamic relations with Iraq&#8221; to mediate among the Taliban, the Northern Alliance and Russia, and that the Taliban invited Iraqi officials to Afghanistan.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Shocking!</strong>  The leaders of Afghanistan wanted to discuss matters with the leaders of Iraq.  After all – we should never allow two heads of state that shared the same religion to discuss anything.  </p>
<p>Of course, the Northern Alliance was the Afghan group that our military worked with to topple the Taliban.  Two days before 9/11, al Qaeda took out the leader of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmed_Shah_Massoud">Northern Alliance</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Massoud was the victim of a suicide attack which occurred at Khuaja Bahaodine on September 9, 2001, two days before the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack in the United States, a timing considered significant by some commentators who believe Osama bin Laden ordered the assassination to ensure he would have the Taliban&#8217;s protection and cooperation in Afghanistan. The attackers were two Arabs who claimed to be Belgians originally from Morocco or Tunisian. However their passports turned out to be stolen. According to some accounts they were posing as journalists, perhaps intending to attack several Northern Alliance council members simultaneously.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess we have found yet another thing that <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YmMwZTUwMzRmNDExMzAyMzVmYTRhYWI0ZjA5MTUxMGY=">Jonah Goldberg</a> does not understand.</p>

There’s not much substance in his latest rant, but I did manage to find this:</p>
<blockquote><p>We now tax their incomes as salary, corporate profits, dividends, capital gains, and at death. But we must do better.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm – income defined as labor income (salary) plus capital income (which includes both dividends and capital gains).  Now if actually did tax all capital income at the same rate as labor income and taxed at when it accrues, we would be doing better.  But Kudlow’s “investor class” cronies oppose such sensible tax reform as they prefer deferral gimmicks and favorable rates as to the taxation of capital income.  Take a deep breathe Larry before you propose a sensible tax reform that I might actually agree with.</p>
