                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/07/an_inconvenient.html">Sulli</a> decided to watch <em>An Inconvenient Truth</em>, which prompted this:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s thoroughly persuasive about the reality of global warming and the contribution of carbon dioxide emissions to it. I&#8217;d recommend it strongly to anyone.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.thepoorman.net/2006/07/26/your-professional-pundit-class-in-action">The Poorman</a> unloaded on Sulli with:<br />
<blockquote>Three weeks ago, the evidence for global warming was akin to Dick Cheney’s case for Iraq’s WMD &#8211; but now, having seen a fucking Hollywood movie about global warming starring famous former VP Al Gore, well, he finds the science persuasive. I’m very pleased, and I hope this change of heart lasts until Dan Quayle comes out with a movie about how the Earth’s not really getting warmer, it’s just that we’re all getting cooler.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s give the slow learner known as Andrew Sullivan a little credit for finally getting the point as he also decides to play policy wonk:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s also striking that Gore could have used the movie to argue for a serious increase in the gas tax &#8211; and he didn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Vice President Gore never advocated addressing global warming?  <a href="http://ezraklein.typepad.com/blog/2006/07/the_amnesia_it_.html">Nicholas Beaudrot</a> remembers the Clinton years a bit differently and adds this political reality:<br />
<blockquote>But the reality-based community also includes political reality, so until some Senate Republican(s)s step up to the plate on carbon taxes or fuel economy, and we can hammer out a compromise solution that includes &#8230; I don&#8217;t know, subsidies to clean coal? Massive wind-power projects across various Republican-held Congressional Districts? A &#8220;feebate&#8221; system for improving fuel economy? &#8230;  policy engagement on global warming is a real suckers&#8217; move.</p></blockquote>
<p>All Sulli bashing aside – I only wish more Republicans wake up to the reality of global warming and show some leadership on this issue.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/27/leaked-memo-global-warming">Judd</a> of Think Progress may be able to explain why Andrew Sullivan et al. where such slow learners on global warming:<br />
<blockquote>A secret memo by the coal industry details a coordinated campaign to spread misinformation about global warming. The memo, written by an association of coal-based utilities in Colorado, expresses fear that if the government address climate change &#8211; through a carbon tax or regulating greenhouse gasses &#8211; it will cut into their profits. Their solution: “support the scientific community that is willing to stand up against the alarmists”.  (”Alarmists” is the word they use to describe people who believe in global warming science. The memo also refers to this group as those “whose true motivation is to stop growth, develop renewable resources [and] discontinue the use of fossil fuels, especially coal.”) But the coal utilities ran up against a problem: their is no scientific community who agrees with them. The memo acknowledges most people who dispute global warming have no “involvement in climatology.”</p></blockquote>
<p>An age old story – some special interest with enough money on the table goes out and hires a bunch of hacks to spread their spin, and folks like Andrew Sullivan eat up this spin as if it were the gospel truth.  Speaking of hacks – the <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTliNzc0M2Q1NzQ5NjQ3Yzc4MzRkMWY5Nzg1Yzc4ZmI=">Corner Kids</a> may be doing their own Sulli bashing but they are ducking Sulli’s discovery that Global Warming exists.  Go figure!</p>

                                <p>As our readers surely have noticed, Kash is posting less frequently of late (though he did make <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/hard-v-soft-landing-debate.html">a recent appearance</a>). And I, unfortunately, have had no time to blog in a long time. While I hope that will change at some point, it probably won&#8217;t be soon.</p>
<p>PGL is doing a great job covering for us both, providing interesting posts on a daily basis. That said, my opinion has long been that several bloggers are better than one. This is true based on both the volume and variety of content. And I think that PGL and Kash agree. As a result, we&#8217;re looking to add one or two regular contributors to the blog.</p>
<p>A Ph.D. in Economics or closely related field would be helpful, but it&#8217;s not required (e.g., a graduate student might do well as a blogger, though I&#8217;m not sure I can in good conscience advise a student to spend time blogging instead of working on her thesis).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no political litmus test, either. But for the sake of overall coherency, it would help if you were not too far right or left of the median post here at Angry Bear.</p>

<blockquote>Opponents of global poverty have reason to celebrate. The recent approval by the US Food and Drug Administration of a new, once-a-day pill against Aids could revolutionise health in developing countries. The news follows approval earlier this year of a cervical cancer vaccine, which may save more than 200,000 lives each year in poor nations. In the US, these breakthroughs have coincided with unprecedented political support for the funding that pays for such medicines. Last year the House of Representatives passed its foreign aid bill with 393 votes, the highest tally in more than two decades. Over the past six years, the US has increased six-fold the money it spends to fight scourges such as Aids and tuberculosis abroad.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kolbe’s good news is life science companies have made some breakthroughs in how we treat aid – followed by a statement that our generous Congress has decided to partially offset some of the monopoly profits that Big Pharma makes on these breakthroughs.</p>
<p>What seems to have Mark objecting to Kolbe’s argument is the following:<br />
<blockquote>But the heights America has reached in such spending may represent the peak of foreign aid, leaving only a hard fall ahead. As the baby-boomer generation ages and begins to draw on Social Security and Medicare, the healthcare system for the over-65s, the funding needs for those programmes will skyrocket. Something else in the budget will have to make way – and America’s foreign aid programme is one of the likeliest candidates for cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Good grief – we spend $27 billion on foreign aid as we have been running a General Fund deficit near $600 billion per year.  That $27 billion is tiny compared to the fact that world population is over 6 billion.  Wow &#8211; $4.50 per person per year is not exactly going to solve world poverty.  As far as Social Security benefits, let’s remember that the Social Security Trust Fund is running a surplus that will allow it to have enough reserves to cover benefits through around 2050.  Yes, it was a combination those Bush tax cuts, K-Street driven pork barrel spending, and an expensive and reckless adventure into Iraq (which has something to do with all that current anger in the Arab streets at U.S. foreign policy as we make a mockery out of Lebanon) that is driving the massive General Fund deficits.  As Mark rightly puts it:<br />
<blockquote>setting world poverty versus &#8220;financing the lifestyles of retired Americans&#8221; is a false and misleading tradeoff designed to achieve the political goal of reducing the size of government &#8230; We can handle the current 20 -30 billion we spend on foreign aid going forward.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110008690">Tunku Varadarajan</a> interviews two economists in love.  I once met the delightful couple &#8211; Milton and Rose Friedman – some 20 years ago and was very impressed.  I had met their non-economist son at dinner a year earlier and he learned economics from two masters.  So I enjoyed this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maladies behind us, we moved to economics, and here I made a reflexive apology for not being an economist myself. &#8220;You mean you&#8217;re not a trained economist,&#8221; was Mr. Friedman&#8217;s comeback. &#8220;I have found, over a long time, that some people are natural economists. They don&#8217;t take a course, but they understand &#8211; the principles seem obvious to them. Other people may have Ph.D.s in economics, but they&#8217;re not economists. They don&#8217;t think like an economist. Strange, but true.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>When Dr. Friedman discussed the role of government intervention, he was rightfully noting that it’s more than just capturing government expenditure to GDP. But then he tries to tell us government spending has doubled – not distinguishing between government purchases versus transfer payments: </p>
<blockquote><p>Here, Mr. Friedman explains &#8220;the story of the postwar period&#8221; in the U.S. &#8220;In 1945-46, intellectual opinion was almost entirely collectivist. But practice was free market. Government was spending something like 20%-25% of national income. But the ideas of people were all for more government. And so from 1945 to 1980 you had a period of galloping socialism. Government started expanding and expanding and expanding.&#8221; Mr. Friedman stopped, as if deciding whether to use the word &#8220;expanding&#8221; a fourth time, before continuing: &#8220;And government spending went from 20% to 40% of national income.</p></blockquote>
<p>As our graph shows, government purchases as a share of GDP have not gone up.  Yes government expenditure was 31% of GDP (not 40%) but the increase from the late 1940’s is mostly an increase in Social Security benefits – which Dr. Friedman labels the “welfare state”.  And it is true that government spending to help citizens pay for their health care is expected to rise – especially given President Bush’s inability to even consider efficiency improving health care policies.  But I have to protest that an able economist like Milton Friedman has carelessly dusted off rightwing spin numbers on the size of the government in what otherwise could have been an interesting interview.  </p>

                                <p>The latest on the privatized Skyway toll road is provided by <a href="http://bureaucrash.com/taxonomy_menu/20/85?from=30">InkyAtari</a> who insists that this story is “Proof that the private sector does things better!”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Skyway doing well under concession &#8211; traffic up 18%, revenues up 35% &#8230; Toll collectors were paid over $20/hour by the City versus $12/hr now.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, profits are up for two reasons: (a) the owners are extracting consumer surplus from motorists; and (b) labor costs are down not because the owners have economized on the number of workers but because they have lowered their pay.  Not exactly the typical definition of efficiency.  </p>
<p>AB readers – remind me of which of our trolls InkyAtari sounds like.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I have a confession.  Our favorite <a href="http://flyunderthebridge.blogspot.com/2006/07/now-about-your-expenses.html">troll</a> blogged on this story first and I wanted to give him a chance to post a comment here before I gave him credit.  I only discovered that other blog because the link to tollroadsnews was not working.  But notice Roland Patrick (aka Patrick R. Sullivan) missed the real story only noting the following:<br />
<blockquote>Interest expense on the $ 1.8 billion up front lease payment being well over $100 million dollars (we would surmise) they&#8217;ll need every economy they can find to make this a wise investment.</p></blockquote>
<p>To which anyone who understands finance goes “HUH”.  He is assuming a 5.5% interest rate but even long-term nominal interest rates are only 5% with real interest rates being only half of that.  It is expected future cash flows that matter not current cash flows and one would expect toll revenues and profits to at least keep pace with the general price-level.  So let’s see – the real interest cost on $1.8 billion is only $45 million – not $100 million.</p>

<p>David opened with:<br />
<blockquote>If I had my way, appeals to the BLS average hourly earnings series would be banished from commentary about wages and the fortunes of the workers &#8211; unless the commentator explains why that measure is a truer measure of labor compensation than those that include in-kind payments to employees (that is, benefits).</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg followed with:<br />
<blockquote>I am always surprised when I see economists compare wages and productivity using wage measures that exclude fringe benefits. Theory says that productivity should determine total compensation, not cash earnings.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad goes “huh” with the detail being:<br />
<blockquote>I thought that everybody knew that wages and salaries were only one component &#8211; albeit the largest component &#8211; of total compensation. But I also thought that everybody knew that (except at the very top end) differences between growth rates of wages and salaries and growth rates of real compensation were relatively small. We have pretty good data on short-run and medium-run movements in average hourly wages and median usual weekly earnings. We have pretty bad data on benefits. We know that average total compensation grows about 0.4% per year faster than average wages and salaries, and that the gap is smaller &#8211; 0.2%? &#8211; at the median. Yes, it would be very nice, it would be better to have median weekly real compensation. But we don&#8217;t. So why not use what we have got?</p></blockquote>
<p>Kash (who has returned to AB blogging) might be happy to see that Greg’s update had to deal with this:<br />
<blockquote>Part of the explanation for this increase is the rising cost of health care. The value of employer-provided health insurance is a key part of many workers&#8217; compensation. It is a benefit that gets more valuable as improvements in medical technology drive up the cost of insurance.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this was not <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/06/is-compensation-finally-catching-up.html">Kash’s argument</a>, which <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/07/what_does_labor.html">David</a> later captured:<br />
<blockquote>Not surprisingly, I received several comments arguing that increases in labor compensation have, in the recent past, been driven by rising health care costs. In making sense of all this, I think it helps to consider two different questions we might want to ask when considering payments to workers.  The first is, &#8220;What does it cost a business to purchase one hour of a worker&#8217;s time?&#8221;  To answer this question, a broad (benefit inclusive) measure of labor compensation is clearly the right one. Now consider the second question: &#8220;Does an increase in payments made by firms to workers make workers better off?&#8221;  On this issue, the answer may very well depend on the difference between compensation paid in dollars and compensation paid in benefits. Maybe, but not necessarily.  Consider two workers, both of whom receive the same total amount of compensation, and both of whom spend exactly the same amount on health care.  Now suppose that those expenditures rise by 10% for both workers.  We&#8217;ll further suppose that worker 1&#8217;s wages rise by 10%, while worker 2&#8217;s employer holds his or her salary constant but picks up the tab for the higher medical costs.  Would you say that worker 1 is better off than worker 2?  Neither would I.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – David does get around to the index number issue.  No – I would not banish reporting on both wages and fringes as separate series even if I agree with David that fringe benefit compensation is part of the story.</p>

                                <p>Making a slow return to actually reading the news, I enjoyed coming across this week&#8217;s <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115340136858912360-LDQXnJsw5D_CgRc5fZ_EuSYQiiI_20070720.html">Econoblog</a> , which revists the hot topic of 2004: whether the world&#8217;s financial imbalances will be corrected via a hard or soft landing.  Nouriel Roubini and David Altig discuss the modest revaluation of the yuan that we&#8217;ve seen over the past year, and the prospects for more of the same.  </p>
<p>For my money, however, the most interesting line in their exchange came right at the end.  David wrote:<br />
<blockquote>I have to say that my opinions have not much changed since Nouriel and I first debated the hard-landing/soft-landing scenarios back in March 2005. True, we are further on up the road, with scant movement toward the rebalancing of trade and capital flows that both of us agreed would have to occur at some point. That might be troubling, but the tipping point just does not feel like it is creeping any closer.</p></blockquote>
<p>David makes a fair point &#8211; and I agree with him that it does not feel like we&#8217;re getting closer to some sort of crisis.  However, I also must wonder this: what should we expect it to feel like?</p>

                                <p>I wonder if <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110008676">Peggy Noonan</a> thinks that is the fault of economist for the incessant free lunch spin that comes from the right as if no one has ever suggested that the law of scarcity applies to the macroeconomy at least in the long-run.  Oh no, we economists never say there is such a thing as crowding-out.  OK, her topic was really global warming.  As <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/20/blame-the-scientists">Judd</a> at ThinkProgress notes, Peggy wrote:<br />
<blockquote>I got thinking, again, of how sad and frustrating it is that the world&#8217;s greatest scientists cannot gather, discuss the question of global warming, pore over all the data from every angle, study meteorological patterns and temperature histories, and come to a believable conclusion on these questions: Is global warming real or not? If it is real, is it necessarily dangerous? What exactly are the dangers? Is global warming as dangerous as, say, global cooling would be? Are we better off with an Earth that is getting hotter or, what with the modern realities of heating homes and offices, and the world energy crisis, and the need to conserve, does global heating have, in fact, some potential side benefits, and can those benefits be broadened and deepened? Also, if global warning is real, what must – must &#8211; the inhabitants of the Earth do to meet its challenges? And then what should they do to meet them? You would think the world&#8217;s greatest scientists could do this, in good faith and with complete honesty and a rigorous desire to discover the truth. And yet they can&#8217;t. Because science too, like other great institutions, is poisoned by politics. Scientists have ideologies. They are politicized.</p></blockquote>
<p>Peggy must have the know-nothings at the National Review confused with scientists.  Ah Peggy, next time that you are reading something from Lawrence Kudlow, realize that he is very politicized and that he is not an economist.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200607200011">Media Matters</a> listens to Rush Limbaugh so we don’t have to:<br />
<blockquote>Additionally, Limbaugh claimed that, in light of scientists&#8217; belief that embryonic stem cells could be useful in medicine, &#8220;we need to re-examine this whole term &#8216;scientist,&#8217; &#8221; because &#8220;[s]cience is all about politics, and science has been so wrong about so many things.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>By working closely with Congress &#8211; and by threatening vetoes when they were called for &#8211; discretionary spending has been kept in check and there hasn&#8217;t been a need to veto a spending bill</p></blockquote>
<p>And yet the same article tells us how fiscal conservatives are claiming just the opposite.  The Cato chart shows discretionary defense spending rising from just under $300 billion in 2000 to just under $500 billion in 2005.  It also shows an increase in discretionary non-defense spending over the same period that was equal to approximately 45%.  To be fair, nominal GDP increased by 27% over this same period.  Even as a share of GDP, discretionary non-defense spending has increased.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/legislation/medicareregs.html">Social Security Online</a> has a summary of the “New Medicare Part D Subsidy”, which begins with:<br />
<blockquote>The Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) established a new voluntary Part D Prescription Drug Program effective January 1, 2006. While the overall responsibility for development and administration of this new program resides with CMS, the statute also requires SSA to take applications and determine eligibility for a new subsidy program. This subsidy will reduce out of pocket costs paid by those Part D enrollees who have limited income (below 150% of the poverty line applicable to the size of the family involved) and resources (up to $10,000 in assets for an individual or $20,000 for a married couple) by providing reduced monthly premiums and other cost-sharing assistance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed, President Bush is going around the national telling seniors that there is some free lunch as the government is subsidizing their health care even as President Bush is telling the rest of us that he is cutting our (current) taxes.  OK, the reality is that this subsidy is increasing our already massive deferred tax liabilities.  </p>
<p>Economists often describe <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_incidence">tax incidence</a> in terms of who ultimately pays the tax.  Similarly, one could ask how much of the incidence of this subsidy accrues to patients versus the suppliers of pharmaceutical products.  <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/07/drug-companies-gone-wild-medicare-part.html">Dean Baker</a> suggests we read the article by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/18/business/18place.html">Milt Freudenheim</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The pharmaceutical industry is beginning to reap a windfall from a surprisingly lucrative niche market: drugs for poor people. And analysts expect the benefits to show up in many of the quarterly financial results that drug makers will begin posting this week. The windfall, which by some estimates could be $2 billion or more this year, is a result of the transfer of millions of low-income people into the new Medicare Part D drug program that went into effect in January. Under that program, as it turns out, the prices paid by insurers, and eventually the taxpayer, for the medications given to those transferred are likely to be higher than what was paid under the federal-state Medicaid programs for the poor … It is too early to calculate the full effect of the shift of the former Medicaid patients now covered by Part D. But analysts expect it to generate hundreds of millions of additional dollars this year for the drug companies, which have long chafed under the pricing restraints of the state programs. Drugs tend to be cheaper under the Medicaid programs because the states are the buyers and by law they receive the lowest available prices for drugs. But in creating the federal Part D program, Congress &#8211; in what critics saw as a sop to the drug industry &#8211; barred the government from having a negotiating role. Instead, prices are worked out between drug makers and the dozens of large and small Part D drug plans run by commercial insurers. Since Part D went into effect, the pharmaceutical industry has raised the wholesale prices of its brand-name drugs an average of 3.6 percent. Although the actual amount spent depends on what each insurer negotiates, in many cases the drugs for those 6.5 million people who used to receive their medicines through Medicaid will cost more now. Initially, the added costs will be paid by the insurers administering the new Medicare drug program. But when it comes time for the insurers to settle accounts with the government, the costs of the 6.5 million drugs for the transferees will end up being passed along to federal taxpayers, according to analysts and health care economists. The windfall for the drug makers was made possible by a provision of the 2003 Medicare law that exempts Part D drugs from “best price” rebates that the drug makers have been required to give to the state Medicaid programs since 1991. Those rebates are meant to make sure that state Medicaid agencies pay no more than the best prices drug companies offer to any big commercial insurer.</p></blockquote>
<p>One of the complaints of fiscal conservatives was that Medicare Part D was too expensive.  Perhaps part of the problem lies in how its pricing was established so as to increase the incidence of the subsidy that would go to the pharmaceutical companies.</p>
