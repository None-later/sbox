                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>One of the Big Four accounting firms is telling its clients:<br />
<blockquote>The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (AJCA) is providing $137 billion in tax cuts over 10 years and comprises three major elements: tax relief for U.S.-based manufacturing activities, reforms in the taxation of multinational businesses and four dozen targeted items of business income tax relief. The act also contains targeted individual tax cuts and excise tax reforms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Part of this $137 billion comes from changes in section 965 addressing how repatriated profits will be taxed.  U.S. multinational corporations have a one-time opportunity to repatriate low-taxed foreign earnings at an incremental U.S. tax cost as low as 5.25%.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2139782">Michelle Leder</a> provided this estimate of the significance of this provision:<br />
<blockquote>IBM, for example, is banking a $2.8 billion refund = well, better to call it a &#8220;tax savings&#8221; &#8211; because instead of paying the normal corporate tax rate of 35 percent on $9.5 billion in profits it earned overseas, the company paid only 5.25 percent … Analysts anticipate that American companies will have repatriated around $350 billion in 2005 as a result of the law. While it&#8217;s hard to make a straight calculation because of the vagaries of the tax code, that works out to a savings of roughly $104 billion on corporate America&#8217;s tax bill. At Pfizer, the pharmaceutical giant that announced the single largest repatriation &#8211; $37 billion &#8211; the one-time windfall works out to approximately $11 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>5.25% times $350 billion would translate into almost $18.4 billion in one-time tax revenues but at what cost?  Ms. Leder’s $104 billion is assuming that the U.S. Treasury would have received in the same year 35% times $350 billion or $122.5 billion.  </p>
<p>Well maybe we should admit a coupe of qualifying factors.  One comes from the foreign tax credit where the Treasury collects the difference between 35% and the tax rate charged abroad.  Since we are talking about deferral strategies which are typically used by putting these profits into low-tax jurisdictions, let’s assume a 10% foreign tax rate so the differential is only 25%.  In other words, the calculation should be 25% times $350 billion or $87.5 billion.  Secondly, deferral implies time value of money.  Let’s assume the profits would not have been repatriated for another 5 years and let’s use a 5% discount rate, which means we gave up $68.5 billion in present value terms to get $18.4 billion now.</p>
<p>So as the Bush Administration crows about the “surge” in taxes, let’s just remember that this is yet another example of Enron accounting where in reality the government gave away $50 billion on net.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/07/silliness-on-budget-deficit.html">Dean Baker</a> criticizes two threads of how the press reports the deficit by taking a medium term perspective.  The first is levied against those free lunch supply-side types:</p>
<blockquote><p>If we go back to 2001, before the economy had the benefit of President Bush’s tax cuts, CBO projected the economy to grow by 20 percent between 2000 and 2006. On its current path, growth over this period is projected to be 16.7 percent. (CBO’s growth projections are constructed to average in the effect of recessions, so the 2001 recession should not affect this story. Furthermore, even the White House’s growth projections do not show the economy ever catching up to the path projected by CBO in 2001. In other words, the White House’s economists don’t believe that the tax cuts have had any substantial impact on growth.) Getting to tax revenue, CBO’s projection of revenue for 2006 was more than 20 percent higher (adjusted for inflation) than the White House’s latest figure. In other words, the economy is behind its pre-tax cut growth path and its way behind its pre-tax cut revenue path. Users of arithmetic know that the tax cuts did not come anywhere close to paying for themselves. The fact that tax revenues are coming in somewhat higher than expected this year is explained largely by the strong stock market performance last year and the resulting increase in capital gains tax revenue. There is always a large random component to tax collections. Arguing about the budget situation based on these random fluctuations is like drawing conclusions on global warming based on yesterday’s weather.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean also notes that the rise in debt relative to GDP over the past five years has not yet bankrupted the Federal government.  If critics of Bush’s fiscal fiasco (which includes yours truly) are writing such statements, we need to be more clear.  The point is that we cannot sustain the current course of fiscal policy just as we could not sustain the Reagan fiscal fiasco forever.  We did see a reversal of the upward path of the debt to GDP ratio once we decided to reverse those tax cuts and had the luxury of the peace dividend.  So are we on a bankruptcy path?  No – unless President Bush gets his way and makes these tax cuts sine spending cuts a permanent policy.  But our point has been – or should be – we never had a tax cut but rather a tax shift.  In other words, President Bush has passed some rather massive increases in deferred taxes.  Who will pay those deferred taxes?  Don’t look to the leadership in the Republican Party to tell us the truth to this question.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTg0MTM1NGY1NzMxNzI0ZGMwNTU2OWViYjgxMTFkZDk=">Phil Kerpen</a> takes the long-term view:</p>
<blockquote><p>The deficit is actually quite modest in historical terms &#8230; Since current budget deficits are affordable, any fiscal focus on them is misdirected. That said, the country’s true fiscal outlook is not so good. A pair of reports released in May by the Medicare and Social Security Trustees and the Government Accountability Office, respectively, should serve as a wake-up call for the public and our elected representatives … The off-the-books, unfunded obligations of the federal government are an order of magnitude greater. The GAO found that the government’s true debt &#8211; on-the-books and off &#8211; more than doubled between 2000 and 2005, and now stands at a staggering $46.4 trillion. GAO, it seems, actually low-balled the true debt by using the entitlement obligations for only the next 75 years. To permanently fix these programs we’d have to put up enough money to cover all of their obligations forever. That’s where the Trustees Report comes in. Using the estimates from that report, the federal government’s true debt is shown to be a stunning $94.7 trillion … The Social Security program alone has a $13.4 trillion liability, more than all of the government’s on-the-books debt combined.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I understand why both Bruce Bartlett and Max Sawicky hate these long-run present value calculations.  Kerpen is spinning that it’s those Social Security benefits that are the real problem even that 13.4 divided by 94.7 is less than 15% of the very long-term issue.  What constitutes the other 85%?  Maybe it’s those tax cuts financed by increases in defense spending?  Or maybe it’s that expensive prescription drug benefit financed by more tax cuts.  </p>
<p>It would have been nice had Kerpen told us the present value of expected future GDP so we could take this $13.4 trillion relative to the present value of expected future GDP.  Then we would realize that the reduction in Social Security benefits and/or the increase in the payroll tax is actually quite modest.  But had Kerpen written something a little more honest – I doubt Rich Lowry would have allowed him to publish it.</p>

                                <p>Beyond the hypocrisy coming from the king of pork, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NzFjOTE5N2E2NjE5MzUxN2IxNGFjYjE4ODUzN2VlZGQ=">Grover Norquist</a>, I’m struggling with the advanced mathematics that must be implicit in this statement:<br />
<blockquote>If spending increased only as a percentage of national income since 2001, the federal government would have a $20 billion budget surplus (not a $296 billion deficit) in fiscal year 2006. Moreover, the country would never have reached surplus in the late 1990s if spending equaled national income. The surplus resulted because spending was actually lower than national income during that time period.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, I know he should have referred to the growth in Federal spending matching the growth in GDP.  Federal spending as a share of GDP was 19.0% during calendar year 2000 as compared to 20.4% during calendar year 2005.  Since GDP was just under $12.5 trillion, my calculator – which must not be Sesame Street approved – tells me that the increase in the ratio of Federal spending to GDP accounts for only $180 billion of the increase in the deficit as being portrayed in terms of the unified deficit.</p>
<p>I know CalculatedRisk wants to jump in here and say something about the General Fund deficit, but could someone who dares get inside the brain of Grover Norquist explain to me how $180 billion become $316 billion?  </p>
<p>I wonder if <a href="http://www.zeroboutique.com/grover">this character</a> might help us out here?!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: AB reader cactus keeps telling me to use OMB figures based on fiscal years rather than BEA figures based on calendar years.  As I go to the link provided by cactus, I think I discover how Norquist is getting his spin.  Consider the following outlay to GDP figures by fiscal year:</p>
<p>18.4% for 2000<br />18.5% for 2001<br />20.1% for 2005<br />20.8% for 2006-PROJECTED<br />20.1% for 2007-projected</p>
<p>So Norquist’s math is not based on actual spending but one of those infamous OMB forecasts.  But maybe this forecast will be on the mark given how badly things are going in Iraq etc.  Of course, Norquist is pretending that spending will continue to be this high even as the OMB projection is for outlays to drop back to 20.1% of GDP for fiscal year.  We should also mention that the “surge” in tax revenues had transitional elements that will not likely re-occur next year either.</p>

                                <p>After reading the reveal nothing column from <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=15988">Robert Novak</a>, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjdlOWZhYTFlZmE0Njk1ZDExYjQ0NzMwMjVkYjgzMGE=">Jonah Goldberg</a> makes an amazing discovery:</p>
<blockquote><p>Okay so the government official who leaked Plame&#8217;s CIA status to Novak is known to Fitzgerald. He hasn&#8217;t been charged. If Novak&#8217;s version is to be believed, and I don&#8217;t see why it shouldn&#8217;t be, the initial leak wasn&#8217;t some nefarious assault on Wilson, but an &#8220;inadvertant&#8221; mistake. So what, exactly, was the big deal? The CIA itself confirmed Plame&#8217;s employment status. Where are the apologies? The whole thing was a big stupid nothing. I&#8217;m not saying by the way, the matter shouldn&#8217;t have been investigated. Merely that the investigation revealed that the initial suspicions were unfounded.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s review the facts as we know them – Bill Harlow (the member of the CIA) upon learning that Novak is about to out the fact that Valerie Plame is a CIA agent tells Novak that it would be a mistake if he does run his piece.  Novak’s primary source was someone within the Administration other than Karl Rove (somewhere we should say something about the Office of the Vice President).  Patrick Fitzgerald’s grand jury is still in session.  So how does Jonah Goldberg know that no wrongdoing occurred?  He does have powers beyond my comprehension!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Even rightwinger <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Conservative_Scarborough_Accidental_leak_story_garbage_0712.html">Joe Scarborough</a> finds the Novak canard that the leak was an accident to be of questionable merit:<br />
<blockquote>Conservative commentators are already trumpeting Novak&#8217;s claim that the leak was inadvertent and accidental &#8230; Maybe I&#8217;m cynical or perhaps it&#8217;s because I worked in Congress for years. But you know what, I always found that leaks of this size were rarely mistakes regardless of what the writer or the right-wing people may tell you. I can assure you that if you assign selfish motives to leakers, you will rarely be proven wrong.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/07/12/yawnwheres-the-news-bob">Christy</a> has more including a picture of a hippo yawning at the Novak “news”.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzU0NmFmODhkYzRiZGY0YWQzYjQwMjkyZjI5ZDAyNDU=">Kate O&#8217;Beirne</a> for the defense:<br />
<blockquote>But Scooter Libby&#8217;s memory is the only one that merits criminal charges and it appears that investigators have known that the disclosure of Plame&#8217;s employment was &#8220;inadvertent&#8221; since the Fall of 2003. This investigation and the indictment are ridiculous.</p></blockquote>
<p>Shorter Kate: obstruction of justice and perjury are AOK if my client has a different memory of events from the prosecutor’s witnesses – especially if I can get a fellow hack to write some garbage over at Human Events.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009011.php">Josh Marshall</a> comes the latest from <a href="http://today.reuters.com/news/newsarticle.aspx?type=politicsNews&#038;storyid=2006-07-12T003233Z_01_N11276431_RTRUKOC_0_US-SECURITY-HOEKSTRA.xml&#038;src=rss&#038;rpc=22">Peter Hoekstra</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Michigan Republican Rep. Peter Hoekstra also suggested some unauthorized leaks could have been deliberate attempts to help al Qaeda.  &#8220;More frequently than what we would like, we find out that the intelligence community has been penetrated, not necessarily by al Qaeda, but by other nations or organizations,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;I don&#8217;t have any evidence. But from my perspective, when you have information that is leaked that is clearly helpful to our enemy, you cannot discount that possibility,&#8221; he added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Unbelivable ! Hoekstra did not mention the outing of CIA agent Valerie Plame and her colleagues but I will.  Given that these agents were looking into the possibility that Iran might be developing nuclear weapons, how could anyone but so stupid to suggest that this leak did not harm national security – unless they are frequent readers of <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/">this</a> or <a href="http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2006/07/back_to_i_lewis.html">this</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/11/novak-explanation">ThinkProgress</a> has the latest on Mr. Novak.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=15988">Robert Novak</a> reveals little:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was interrogated at the Swidler Berlin offices Oct. 7, 2003, by an FBI inspector and two agents. I had not identified my sources to my attorneys, and I told them I would not reveal them to the FBI. I did disclose how Valerie Wilson&#8217;s role was reported to me, but the FBI did not press me to disclose my sources.</p></blockquote>
<p>So before Fitzgerald took over this investigation – the FBI was not asking who Novak’s primary source was?</p>
<blockquote><p>However, on Jan. 12, two days before my meeting with Fitzgerald, the special prosecutor informed Hamilton that he would be bringing to the Swidler Berlin offices only two waivers. One was by my principal source in the Valerie Wilson column, a source whose name has not yet been revealed. The other was by presidential adviser Karl Rove, whom I interpret as confirming my primary source&#8217;s information. In other words, the special prosecutor knew the names of my sources.</p></blockquote>
<p>And even today, Novak does not disclose the name of his primary source.  The rest of his Human Events piece is just Novak posturing and spinning with lines like these:<br />
<blockquote>That Fitzgerald did not indict any of these sources may indicate his conclusion that none of them violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act &#8230; Following my interview with the primary source, I sought out the second administration official and the CIA spokesman for confirmation. I learned Valerie Plame&#8217;s name from Joe Wilson&#8217;s entry in &#8220;Who&#8217;s Who in America.&#8221; I considered his wife&#8217;s role in initiating Wilson&#8217;s mission, later confirmed by the Senate Intelligence Committee, to be a previously undisclosed part of an important news story. I reported it on that basis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Novak remains the loyal puppet for this Administration.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://finance.senate.gov/press/Bpress/2005press/prb071106a.pdf">Max Baucus</a> has been reading the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/OMB/budget/fy2006/pdf/06msr.pdf">Mid-Session Review</a> and is not happy with one proposal:<br />
<blockquote>The Mid-Session Budget Review released by the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB) today included a proposal that would spend $721 billion – nearly $10 billion more than originally planned in the President’s original Fiscal Year 2007 budget – to turn Social Security into a system of private accounts with lower guaranteed benefits to Americans. The President’s proposal to privatize Social Security includes significant cuts in guaranteed benefits for the vast majority of Social Security recipients through the indexing of initial benefits to prices, rather than wages.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, I’ve only included Senator Baucus’s recitation of the facts.  Read on as he blasts this proposal.  But to be fair and balanced, let’s review the claims made by the OMB:</p>
<blockquote><p>This update also includes the estimated budget impact from the creation of personal accounts under the President’s Social Security reform proposal. Transition financing for these accounts would not begin to take effect until 2009, and is easily accommodated within the President’s deficit reduction goal &#8230; The greatest fiscal danger over the long-term is posed by the unfunded obligations in major entitlement programs &#8211; Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. The rising costs of these programs are tied largely to two factors: The aging of the population, and the growing use and cost of health care. Both of these factors are largely structural. In 2008, the first of the Baby Boom generation begins to collect Social Security benefits. In 2017, the program will collect less in payroll taxes than it pays out in benefits. At that point, the system will be funded partially by general tax revenue. In 2041, the system is projected to go bankrupt because it will have insufficient resources to pay benefits. </p></blockquote>
<p>We have to stop as we’ve allowed too many lies to go unanswered.  First, the Social Security Trust Fund will be accumulating a lot of reserves that will be paying interest so that reserves will continue to grow after 2017.  At some point, this pre-funding will be drawn upon to pay for the defined benefits owed to the baby boomers but this system is not bankrupt as of 2041.  It is true that the prescription drug benefit was passed just as we were cutting taxes – so when President Bush brags to us about giving us this allegedly free entitlement and giving us our money back – he is lying through his teeth, but that should not be confused with the solvency of Social Security.  But let’s have these dishonest hacks return to the microphone: <br />
<blockquote>President Bush has proposed reforms to address the system’s long-term insolvency while making Social Security a better deal for today’s young workers. </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – everyone can be better off as there are free lunches as far as the eye can see!  <strong>Pathetic!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Via <a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009018.php">Josh Marshall</a> comes <a href="http://www.crgazette.com/2006/07/12/Home/grassley.htm">Senator Grassley</a> sayings it is not fair for us Democrats to discuss the President’s proposal to trash Social Security:<br />
<blockquote>Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said Wednesday Democrats such as Bruce Braley in the 1st District House race are abusing the issue of Social Security reform for political gain.  Grassley said the Democrats are losing Iraq as a political issue to recapture a congressional majority and have fallen back to &#8220;scare tactics&#8221; about Social Security to fuel their campaign.  &#8220;I don’t think I agree right now there is a big push by anybody to set up personal accounts&#8221; under Social Security, Grassley told Iowa reporters.  Braley, in the Democrats’ response to last Saturday’s national radio address by President Bush,  said Social Security was &#8220;under attack&#8221; because of attempts by Bush to privatize it.</p></blockquote>
<p>We are not allowed to talk about minimum wages either – just flag burning, I guess.</p>

<p>President Bush <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/07/20060711-1.html">Discussing Mid-Session Review</a> putting forth a host of myths including the propositions that: (1) the Laffer Curve is working; and (2) that his Administration is serious about cutting government spending.  Where to begin?<br />
<blockquote>One of the most important measures of our success in cutting the deficit is the size of the deficit in relation to the size of our economy. Think of it like a mortgage. When you take out a home loan, the most important measure is not how much you borrow, it is how much you borrow compared to how much you earn. If your income goes up, your mortgage takes up less of your family&#8217;s budget. Same is true of our national economy. When the economy expands, our nation&#8217;s income goes up and the burden of the deficit shrinks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our graph shows the total Federal debt relative to GDP from 1996 to 2007 (projected).  The debt to GDP ratio had declined to 32.6% by 1981 but the type of fiscal irresponsibility we saw under St. Ronald Reagan led to a debt to GDP ratio equal to 67.3% before the fiscal sanity of the 1990’s finally took hold.  By 2001, the debt to GDP ratio had declined to 57.4%.  But the current fiscal irresponsibility has caused the debt to GDP ratio to rise to 64.3% as of the end of fiscal 2005.  Table B.79 of the Economic Report of the President suggests that it will rise to 67.5% by the end of fiscal 2007.  OK, this Administration does tend to high ball its short-term forecasts of deficits so the President can tout that his free lunch supply-side policies have led to more tax revenues than his bogus forecasts predicted.  But every forecasts of the future debt to GDP ratio based on current fiscal policy has this ratio rising quite substantially.  So when the President talks about the shrinking burden of the debt, he must be talking about what happened during the late 1990’s and not his own fiscal record. </p>
<p>President Bush also painted us Democrats as Marxists and the Republicans as Keynesians:<br />
<blockquote>When I came to Washington, taxes were too high, and the economy was headed into a recession. Some said the answer was to centralize power in Washington, and let the politicians make the decisions about what to do with the people&#8217;s money. That was one point of view. We had a different point of view. I believe that the economy prospers when we trust the American people to make their own decisions about how to save, spend and invest. So starting in 2001, my administration worked with the United States Congress and we delivered the largest tax relief since Ronald Reagan was in the White House. We cut rates for everyone who pays income taxes. We reduced the marriage penalty, we doubled the child tax credit, and we cut the death tax. We cut the tax paid by most small businesses because we understand that most new jobs are created by small businesses. And we encouraged economic expansion by cutting taxes on dividends and capital gains. Together, these tax cuts left nearly $1.1 trillion in the hands of American workers and families and small business owners, and they used this money to help fuel an economic resurgence that&#8217;s now in its 18th straight quarter of growth. The tax cuts we passed work … Since August 2003, the U.S. economy has added more than 5.4 million new jobs. Our unemployment rate is down to 4.6 percent… Our job in Washington is to keep this expansion growing &#8211; going, and to promote pro-growth policies that let Americans keep more of their hard-earned paychecks and aid us in reducing our fiscal deficit. In order to reduce the deficit, you got to set priorities. And in working with Congress, we&#8217;ve set clear priorities. And the number one priority of this administration and this Congress is to make sure men and women who are defending the security of the United States and helping to spread peace through the spread of liberty get all the help they need from our government. We will always fund the troops in harm&#8217;s way.</p></blockquote>
<p>Economies typically eventually recover from recessions even without the aid of aggregate demand policies.  And if the Republicans think that tax cuts are the only way to increase aggregate demand, let me suggest that his version of tax cuts may not have even been the best way to restore full employment.  But if we have reached full employment as the Republicans are suggesting – then the continued fiscal mismanagement of cutting taxes while having high government spending lowers national savings, which is what is behind the Federal Reserve’s decision to raise interest rates – which will crowd-out investment.  But never mind my sermon – go check out <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/has_the_budget_.html">Mark Thoma</a> and the <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/7-10-06bud.htm">CBPP</a>. </p>
<p>President Bush went on to imply that his Administration is cutting non-defense Federal spending but if one compared Federal spending as a share of GDP in 2005 versus what it was in 2000, spending has risen from 19% of GDP to 20.4% of GDP.  The increase in the defense spending to GDP ratio was only 0.9% with the increase in nondefense purchases as a share of GDP being 0.2%.  So even Federal transfers have risen faster than GDP.  President Bush also seems to think that cutting about $30 billion in waste will solve a $600 billion per year General Fund deficit problem.  Isn’t fuzzy math magical?</p>
<p>But it’s this part of his speech that really concerns me:<br />
<blockquote>The next test is whether or not we can get a line-item veto out of the United States Senate. A line-item veto is an important tool for controlling spending. See, it will allow the President to target unnecessary spending that sometimes lawmakers put into large bills. Today when a lawmaker loads up a good bill with wasteful spending, I don&#8217;t have any choices. I either sign the bill with the bad spending or veto the whole bill that&#8217;s got good spending in it. And I think it would be wise if we&#8217;re seriously &#8211; seriously concerned about wasteful spending to enable the executive branch to interface effectively with the legislative branch to eliminate that kind of wasteful spending. And so we&#8217;ve proposed a line-item veto that the House of Representatives passed. Under this proposal, the President can approve spending that&#8217;s necessary; redline spending that&#8217;s not; and send back the wasteful, unnecessary spending to the Congress for a prompt up or down vote.</p></blockquote>
<p>President Bush and his allies in Congress destroyed the paygo rules that served the Clinton Administration and Congress so well in the 1990’s.  He also introduced Senator Ted “bridge to nowhere” Stevens just before his speech on his allegedly fiscally responsible regime.  Look, I’m all for restoring fiscal discipline but I don’t trust either this President or the current GOP leadership in Congress.  Currently if Senator Stevens wants another bridge to nowhere he must get at least a couple of sleazy Democrats to go along with him in some giant log-rolling scam – none of which President Bush has bothered to veto.  President Bush and Karl Rove also treat the U.S. Treasury as some sort of giant partisan piggy bank.  Unfortunately, we have to deal with this partisan and fiscally irresponsible President for two more years – but we don’t have to allow Dennis Hastert to be the Speaker for two more year.  But imagine if we gave THIS President a line item veto and had a GOP dominated Congress at the same time.  The new motto would be “pork is for us but not for thee” as Karl Rove’s loyal soldiers would pass out partisan goodies only to those who supported his agenda since President Bush could line item veto anything else.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/07/is_the_surge_in.html">Menzie Chinn</a> has more on both the short-term volatility of tax revenues and the long-term deficit prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>:  For those in Pennsylvania, take note.  <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2006/07/10/rick-santorum-left-right-and-wrong">David Boaz</a> of the Cato Institute describes Rick Santorum thusly:<br />
<blockquote>So . . . the third-ranking Republican leader in the Senate wants to be known as a porker, an earmarker, and Senator Pothole … He declared himself against individualism, against libertarianism, against “this whole idea of personal autonomy, &#8230; this idea that people should be left alone.” Now he’s also against the conservative idea that taxpayers matter, that the federal government has a limited role &#8230; At least Santorum is right about one thing: sometimes the left and the right meet in the center. In this case the big-spending, intrusive, mommy-AND-daddy-state center. But he’s wrong that we’ve never had a firmly individualist society where people are “left alone, able to do whatever they want to do.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Just another Bush Republican who keeps voting to increase taxes on our children!</p>

                                <p>I live close to my office in Los Angeles but on occasion have to drive down to Orange County, which is a task I truly abhor as it causes me to deal with some of the worst traffic and worst drivers in these two rather different parts of Southern California.  Yesterday, I had to do so but I did get to listen to some very good NPR discussions as to how Proposition 103 might lower my insurance rates.  The debate raised several questions in my mind and the good news is that <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/should_geograph.html">Mark Thoma</a> treats us to an article from the Los Angeles Times and his own thoughts:<br />
<blockquote>If the market is competitive and rates are already set to price risk efficiently, and geography plays a significant role in the risk assessment, then complying with Proposition 103 would move away from the efficient outcome unless it corrects a market failure &#8230; The part people find objectionable, I think, is that their rates are linked to factors outside of their immediate control. Where you live, not your individual skills as a driver determine your rates. In big cities, there is a congestion externality, and that extra congestion increases the chances of an accident. There are also other factors such as how often cars get stolen that play a role in pricing geographic locations as well. Again, assuming people take appropriate precautions, this is outside of their individual control.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I choose to live close to work, have a stellar driving record, and have not had my car stolen.  So why do I pay high insurance premiums?  Am I underestimating the expected cost to my insurance company or is there some form of asymmetric information problem where my insurance company does not understand what I low risk my driving habits represent?  Or could the NPR discussion that implied that there is an element of market power at play here be part of the story?</p>

                                <p>The Federal Reserve <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/housedebt/default.htm">reported</a> today that Household Debt Service for Q1 2006, as a percent of disposable personal income, set another all time record of 13.93%.</p>
<p>For homeowners, the Financial Obligations Ratio (FOR) was 17.59% and the mortgage component of FOR was 11.41%; both new all time records.</p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/FORQ106.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/FORQ106.jpg"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<blockquote><p>DEFINITIONS: <i>The household debt service ratio (DSR) is an estimate of the ratio of debt payments to disposable personal income. Debt payments consist of the estimated required payments on outstanding mortgage and consumer debt. </p>
<p>The financial obligations ratio (FOR) adds automobile lease payments, rental payments on tenant-occupied property, homeowners&#8217; insurance, and property tax payments to the debt service ratio.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>  The extraordinary level of indebtedness (and debt service), compared to historical levels, might explain why Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) have grown faster than personal income (PI) in recent years. </p>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/PCEQ106.jpg"><img border="0" src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/PCEQ106.jpg"></a></p>
<p>The chart above shows PCE as a percent of Personal Income for the last 50 years.  For the last few years, this ratio has been close to 85%; far above the normal range.  The result has been a negative savings rate for the last year.  (See: Savings Rate <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/06/gdp-q1-personal-savings.html">Quarterly</a>, Savings Rate <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/06/core-pce-and-savings-rate.html">monthly</a>)</p>
<p>It appears households have borrowed against their homes to maintain their lifestyles and consumption.  As the housing bubble continues to unwind, this might impact PCE in the future as some households struggle with their debt service.</p>
<p>On a related note, with the new bankruptcy law, homeowners cannot easily walk away from their mortgage debt like during the housing busts of the early &#8217;80s and &#8217;90s.

                                <p>The <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTVlZWE2NDQ3ZDkyMDA3ODhkNzIzOTNmOGRkMmYyYjM=">National Review</a> decided to run Kudlow’s thoroughly discredited nonsense about output growth, which included these claims:<br />
<blockquote>Well, the marquis employment report for June may have showed “only” 121,000 new nonfarm payroll jobs, below Wall Street expectations. But this leads to another factoid that the mainstream media largely ignores: The household survey of job creation has been booming at a much faster clip than headline corporate payrolls. This survey shows 387,000 new jobs in June, following 288,000 in May. When this last happened in 2003-04 (remember the “jobless recovery” election-year rant of Democrats?), it was corporate payrolls that caught up to the more entrepreneurial household survey &#8211; which more accurately records job creation by small-business owner/operators &#8230; Wages are rising today, so we know domestic labor markets must be tightening, not softening &#8230; The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics is recognizing the importance of the small-business-driven household survey, and has suggested averaging household jobs with the corporate payroll survey to get a clearer jobs picture.</p></blockquote>
<p>Since nominal wages grew by less than inflation – real wages fell.  Kudlow is still touting his bogus argument that the household survey is a more reliable measure of employment growth – but as to this last claim, check out <a href="http://www.blah3.com/article.php?story=20060710130150304">this rebuttal</a>: <br />
<blockquote>BLS has always maintained that both surveys are needed to provide a complete picture of the labor market [ed. note: This was not at issue], but BLS has not suggested that one should average the monthly household and payroll survey employment estimates, or the over-the-month changes of these figures. </p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if Glenn Reynolds still considers Kudlow to be <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/07/i_dont_think_th.html">reliable</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: K Harris asked in a comment why the Household Survey increase has exceeded the Payroll Survey increase by almost 1 million.  Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/fed_watch_still.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes <a href="http://users2.wsj.com/lmda/do/checkLogin?mg=wsj-users2&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fonline.wsj.com%2Farticle%2FSB115231020168301049.html">Grep Ip</a> explaining the difference in the growth of the two measures of employment growth:<br />
<blockquote>The two surveys often send different signals, but the differences have been especially large lately. Since December, payroll jobs are up 854,000 while household employment is up 1,584,000. Since both surveys estimate total employment from a sample, neither is a perfect tally but economists generally prefer the payroll survey because its sample is far larger &#8211; about 400,000 establishments, compared to the household survey&#8217;s 60,000 households. In theory, the two could be completely accurate yet come up with widely different job counts, because they define employment differently. In June, these definitional differences accounted for more than the entire difference in the two results. </p>
<p>Of the many definitional differences, the largest, in terms of magnitude, are that the household survey counts the self-employed while the payroll survey does not; and that the payroll survey counts someone with two jobs twice, whereas the household survey counts that person once. Each month, the BLS comes up with a household estimate of employment as using the payroll survey&#8217;s definition of employment. In June, that total showed a decline in jobs of 92,000 from May. (You can see the estimates and a technical note on their web site here: http://www.bls.gov/web/ces_cps_trends.pdf1) </p>
<p>Is this positive or negative news for the job market? The answer depends on the reason for the divergence. If it&#8217;s because the ranks of the self-employed are growing, the job market is stronger than the payroll survey suggests. If it&#8217;s because the number of people with multiple jobs is shrinking, the market is weaker than the household survey shows &#8211; all else equal. In June, the message appears to be negative. The number of the self-employed rose 20,000. But the number of multiple job-holders fell 320,000, which means at least that many fewer paychecks from this group. (It may not mean less income: The worker may have gone from two part time jobs to one full time job.) But these two categories swing widely from month to month. In the last six months, the number of the self-employed has risen 346,000 while the number of multiple-job holders has fallen just 75,000. Even using the payroll definition, the household data are still highly volatile; it showed a huge gain of 606,000 jobs in May from April, far more than the payroll survey&#8217;s increase of 92,000. </p>
<p>Yet since last August, the two have told almost the same story: Jobs are up by 1.4 million according to the payroll survey, and 1.3 million using the household survey but the payroll definition. The household survey using the broader household definition is up by 1.9 million, which means about 600,000 extra jobs that can&#8217;t be explained by definitional differences. It may be a sign, albeit an inconclusive one, that job creation is stronger than the payroll survey suggests.</p></blockquote>
