                                <p>After reading <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/07/02/sunday-talking-head-thread-12">Christy</a> say this:<br />
<blockquote>What the WaPo doesn’t feature, but Atrios does — and I thought this was interesting as I looked up the individual show schedules as well:  balance for these shows in pundit/journalist segment equals several partisan conservative commentators and two journalists</p></blockquote>
<p>I wrote <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/gitmo-trials-lets-help-senator-john.html">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>First, invite John Warner to lunch and ask him to bring along Lindsey Graham and John McCain. Before my liberal friends scream that this would be a lunch similar to most Meet the Press panels – that is tilted toward the right – hear me out.</p></blockquote>
<p>I owe John Harwood and William Safire a big apology.  Of course, Dana Priest was excellent even as <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTc3MTY4NTgzMTE2OGMwNWYxMWNhZjllOGQzZDVhMzE=">John Goldberg</a> whines.  But check out the clip provided <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2006/07/dana_priests_cheap_shot_video">here</a>.   <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_07_02_atrios_archive.html#115185893824274781">Duncan Black</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>While the ideological makeup of the MTP panel today was absurd, it was good to see that the journalists, and even Andrea Mitchell, seemed to understand that something obscene was going on. Kudos to the producer who sat Dana Priest next to the bloviating gambling gasbag, who had previoulsy called for her to be imprisoned. As Bennett kept yammering on and interrupting people they mostly managed to treat him like a deranged drunk uncle whose presence in the room made them ill.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yet, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZWRjNDU1NGU3MDg3YzQzMTNiNjlkZWFhOTA5Yjg5ODM=">Jonah Goldberg</a> argues:<br />
<blockquote>Today&#8217;s &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; roundtable, still going, is a scandal of media egocentrism. With the exception of Bill Bennett, the groupthink on display is staggering. Criticizing the media is inherently silly according to this papal conclave of journalists. Any criticism is either an example of know-nothing populism or cynical electioneering, according to Dana Priest, Bill Safire, John Harwood et al. Journalists are always heroes and leakers should never be prosecuted. We&#8217;re always right, no matter what. It&#8217;s just an outrageous display of self-importance.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s turn to the <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13615446">MTP transcript</a> and watch Bill Bennett advocating a tyranny replace our Constitution:<br />
<blockquote>All right, now you’ve got, you’ve got, you’ve got three people on one side, you’ve got me on the other side. Let me just, let me just state my position. It’s not time to break out the champagne and the Pulitzers &#8230; The difference is, the government was elected. People may not like the Bush administration, but they were elected and they are entitled to due consideration on these matters &#8230; Is it wrong for the government to go after the press when the press has gone too far?</p></blockquote>
<p>This was followed by:<br />
<blockquote>MR. SAFIRE: Oh, you’re saying “get after them.” That means threatening reporters, and threaten them with contempt and put them in jail.<br />MR. BENNETT: Absolutely, absolutely.<br />MR. SAFIRE: And that’s wrong.<br />MS. MITCHELL: Bill, what, what&#8230;(unintelligible)&#8230;let me ask, Bill&#8230;<br />MR. BENNETT: Why is that wrong, Bill? Why are they above the law?<br />MR. SAFIRE: Because they’re affected&#8230;<br />MR. HARWOOD: Because it’s a big step toward tyranny, which is what we’re supposed to be withholding.<br />MR. BENNETT: It isn’t a step toward tyranny. And what about the AIPAC, guys? Is that a step toward tyranny? They’re being prosecuted under the Espionage Act. Isn’t that more a step toward tyranny?</p></blockquote>
<p>Here are the some of the other highlights from William Safire:<br />
<blockquote>Here we are on Independence Day weekend, 230 years ago, celebrating what was the resistance to a king who said “We’re going to hang you for treason.” And here we have a Long Island congressman, happens to be named King, who’s saying “treason” and “put these reporters in jail.” I think there’s a big fundamental thing going on here now, and across the board, of “get the press, get the media.” &#8230; just as the American founding fathers challenged the British government. Now it’s not treasonable, it’s not even wrong for the press to say we’re going to find out what we can and we’ll act as a check and balance on the government. Sometimes we’ll make mistakes. Sometimes the government will mistake &#8230; We need to get after those people, and one way to get after those people is to talk to the reporters who &#8211; with whom they spoke.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is one the highlight from John Harwood:<br />
<blockquote>There is not a large ideological gap between the news staffs of those two places, and why would there be? Some of the top people of The New York Times were hired from The Wall Street Journal. What I found shocking about the editorial was the assertion that The New York Times did not act in good faith in making that judgment. I don’t know anybody on the news staff of The Wall Street Journal that believes that. I certainly don’t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, I owe Harwood and Safire a big apology.  Meanwhile, it does look like Jonah Goldberg would rather have King George I than a free press.  </p>
<p>As far as leakers never being prosecuted, go back to the clip of Dana Priest where she listed the items that would represent actions by the press that could invoke prosecution – as in the leaking of the name of a CIA operative.  Yet – the National Review is arguing that the Office of the Vice President should be above the law on PlameGate.  Mr. Bennnet decide to raise the 85 days in prison for Judy Miller failing to let the viewers know she was helping the White House in their obstruction of justice.  While Judy Miller helped the Office of the Vice President leak classified information designed to mislead us in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq, that is not something anyone of us think should be prosecuted – just condemned.</p>
<p><strong>Memo to Jonah Goldberg</strong> – there are some leaks that are truly beyond the pale as in the PlameGate matter.  Too bad your organization is defending those leakers as you shown your disdain for a free press.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGNiZGI5YWU4ZDJhOTFhYTVmNzBiODFmYTU2ODM4ZTc=">Jonah</a> replies by saying that my post:</p>
<blockquote><p>offers a perfect case study of the principles and priorities of leftwing bloggers generally. After a long and revealing pile of excerpts, quotes and leaps of factual and logical fancy</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice he did not say what were the “leaps of factual and logical fancy” but he did continue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Get it? Leaks that objectively undermine the war effort  which definitionally means putting peoples&#8217; lives at greater risk  are necessary in order to live in a free country. But alleged leaks of Valerie Plame&#8217;s name are so beyond the pale they must be prosecuted at all costs. Of course, to date there&#8217;s no evidence that Plame&#8217;s name was leaked in order to put her life in danger. Indeed, to date, there&#8217;s no evidence that leaking Plame&#8217;s name was even against the law or that it caused any damage whatsoever &#8211; save forcing us to endure listening to Joe Wilson talk about what a hero he is.</p></blockquote>
<p>Letting the public know what al Qaeda figured out in regards SWIFT put no one’s live at risk and in no way undermined the GWOT.  When Ms. Plame’s name was leaked, the intent of the Office of the Vice President was to attack her husband, but everyone knows that the lives of several CIA agents were put at risk.  Everyone except Jonah Goldberg.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>John Warner is a grownup Republican who I suspects wants to do the right thing in the aftermath of Hamdan.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/01/us/01gitmo.html">Kate Zernike</a> reports:<br />
<blockquote>A leading Senate Republican said Friday that he was not sure that Congress should pass legislation to create new military tribunals for terror suspects, a stance that raised doubts about prospects for a White House plan to establish an alternative to the commissions struck down this week by the Supreme Court. The senator, John W. Warner of Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, said he had not yet decided what course Congress should take. But Mr. Warner, who will preside over hearings on the issue in July, said he was concerned that new tribunals, even if authorized by Congress, might not withstand judicial scrutiny. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to do this extremely carefully and accurately, or we&#8217;re going to end up with a solution that once again ends up being the subject of litigation, and possibly being overturned,&#8221; Mr. Warner said in an interview in his office.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://balkin.blogspot.com/2006/06/hamdan-as-democracy-forcing-decision.html">Jack Balkin</a> reviews the Hamdan decision and gives us a clue as to the way forward:</p>
<blockquote><p>the Court told the President that under Article 36 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, he could not do so. That is because Article 36 of the UCMJ requires that the rules for military commissions be roughly the same as those for courts martial (which generally are used for offenses committed by our own soldiers). The UCMJ also requires that military commissions comport with the laws of war, which include the Geneva Conventions. Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions, in turn, requires that people like Hamdan be tried by &#8220;regularly constituted court[s] affording all the judicial guarantees . . . recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.&#8221; As Justice Kennedy&#8217;s concurrence points out, the latter requirement dovetails to some degree with the UCMJ&#8217;s requirement of uniformity between what we do for our own soldiers and what we do for people like Hamdan. The courts have to be regularly constituted, i.e., they can&#8217;t be special purpose fly-by-night courts with their own made up procedures, and the procedures have to comport with basic guarantees of fairness, as, one presumes, our court martial system does.</p></blockquote>
<p>Balkin also gives us a clue what Karl Rove is likely hoping for:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Congress decides to alter the UCMJ and override the Geneva Conventions, the President can have his military tribunals with procedures as unfair as he wants. But that would require that Congress publicly decide (1) that it no longer wanted to abide by the principle of uniformity announced in the UCMJ, (2) that it no longer required that military commissions abide by the laws of war, or, finally, (3) that Congress no longer considered the Geneva Conventions binding on the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>I realize that the GOP leadership in the House and in the Senate likely wants to follow the Rovian partisan path preferring to abuse this issue than to offer something constructive.  But this bit of snark from <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_06/009108.php">Kevin Drum</a> gave me an idea:</p>
<blockquote><p>And Democrats would be right to support tough guidelines, which could probably sail through Congress with bipartisan support to spare if that&#8217;s what the Republican leadership wants. They don&#8217;t, of course. They want a campaign issue, not a solution, and most likely won&#8217;t rest until they manage to find legislative wording so punitive and extreme that even Hillary Clinton can&#8217;t support it. It may not be good for the country, but it makes for good C-SPAN.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin was noting the partisan tendencies of the GOP leadership (not endorsing it as some on the <a href="http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2006/06/gd_hamdan_caref.html">right</a> seem to be doing) and he seems to have rather low expectations for Senator Clinton.  But here is how she can exceed expectations.  First, invite John Warner to lunch and ask him to bring along Lindsey Graham and John McCain.  Before my liberal friends scream that this would be a lunch similar to most Meet the Press panels – that is tilted toward the right – hear me out.  Senators Graham and McCain have been leaders on this issue.  Secondly, have this foursome meet with Senators Feingold and Leahy – both able liberals.  A meeting of these six Senators could craft a very good piece of legislation.</p>
<p>I realize the demagogues in the House GOP leadership will be quickly crafting the type of bill that Kevin fears.  Which is all the more reason why the Senate needs to show real leadership.  I also realize that Bill Frist is likely working with Karl Rove to make this issue as partisan as possible.  But if the Democrats work with Senators Graham, McCain, and Warner – I bet they can bring along a few other Republican Senators who’d love to buck Frist’s misguided leadership and put principle above partisanship.</p>

<blockquote><p>The two editors &#8211; Dean Baquet and Bill Keller &#8211; rely heavily on the idea that government officials shouldn&#8217;t have the final say over what gets out and what remains secret. Citizens need to be able to evaluate these officials, who can&#8217;t be trusted controlling the flow of information. As Baquet and Keller put it: &#8220;They want us to protect their secrets, and they want us to trumpet their successes.&#8221; Government officials are biased toward suppressing things that make them look bad, and the press needs to bring out the full story, so that citizens can exercise the independent judgment that is crucial to democracy. But the recently revealed secrets &#8211; about the surveillance of telephone call patterns and financial transactions &#8211; were not cases of government suppressing failures. These ongoing programs were successful, and revealing the secrets impaired the operation of very significant efforts in the war on terrorism.</p></blockquote>
<p>The operative word here being WERE as Al Qaeda figured out SWIFT a while back.  If Ann thinks this is only about suppressing news about failures as in Katrina – maybe she skipped earlier portions of this op-ed:<br />
<blockquote>Thirty-five years ago yesterday, in the Supreme Court ruling that stopped the government from suppressing the secret Vietnam War history called the Pentagon Papers, Justice Hugo Black wrote: &#8220;The government&#8217;s power to censor the press was abolished so that the press would remain forever free to censure the government. The press was protected so that it could bare the secrets of the government and inform the people.&#8221; As that sliver of judicial history reminds us, the conflict between the government&#8217;s passion for secrecy and the press&#8217;s drive to reveal is not of recent origin. This did not begin with the Bush administration, although the polarization of the electorate and the daunting challenge of terrorism have made the tension between press and government as clamorous as at any time since Justice Black wrote. Our job, especially in times like these, is to bring our readers information that will enable them to judge how well their elected leaders are fighting on their behalf, and at what price. In recent years our papers have brought you a great deal of information the White House never intended for you to know &#8211; classified secrets about the questionable intelligence that led the country to war in Iraq, about the abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan, about the transfer of suspects to countries that are not squeamish about using torture, about eavesdropping without warrants. As Robert G. Kaiser, associate editor of The Washington Post, asked recently in the pages of that newspaper: &#8220;You may have been shocked by these revelations, or not at all disturbed by them, but would you have preferred not to know them at all? If a war is being waged in America&#8217;s name, shouldn&#8217;t Americans understand how it is being waged?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>George W. Bush is a lot like Nixon.  Nixon wanted to suppress the fact that he was waging a war on those who he perceived to be his domestic enemies, which included Democrats as people who opposed our continued involvement in Indochina.  The current debate is more about this White House’s war on American liberties and values.  Ann should let us know if she is with Bush in his war on America liberties and values or if she wants to join Democrats, Republicans, and independents who still cherish what our republic has strived to be for the past 217 years.</p>

                                <p>One of the criticisms of the Hamdan convention that is offered by certain <a href="http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2006/06/gd_hamdan_caref.html">rightwingers</a> goes like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>the Supreme Court&#8217;s new ability to enter into treaties with terrorist groups &#8211; extending the Geneva Convention to Al Qaeda seems daft.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe these rightwingers should read the <a href="http://www.unhchr.ch/html/menu3/b/91.htm"> Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Article 1: The High Contracting Parties undertake to respect and to ensure respect for the present Convention in all circumstances. <br />Article 2: In addition to the provisions which shall be implemented in peace time, the present Convention shall apply to all cases of declared war or of any other armed conflict which may arise between two or more of the High Contracting Parties, even if the state of war is not recognized by one of them. The Convention shall also apply to all cases of partial or total occupation of the territory of a High Contracting Party, even if the said occupation meets with no armed resistance. Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations. They shall furthermore be bound by the Convention in relation to the said Power, if the latter accepts and applies the provisions thereof. </p></blockquote>
<p>While Al Qaeda may not have signed this treaty, the U.S. has.  What part of “Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations” do these rightwingers not understand?</p>
<p>Update: As some troll claims the Gitmo detainees are not POWs &#8211; <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/7/1/14377/70288">McJoan</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>the Rubber Stamp Republican Congress is intending to make political hay of the Supreme Court Hamdan decision by painting the Democrats as weak on terrorism. Well, that&#8217;s news. Let&#8217;s talk about what that really means for the Republicans. It means they are branding themselves as pro-torture. Because what the administration&#8217;s insistence upon military commissions really has been all about, from the beginning, is torture. The military commissions operate outside of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and common Article 3 of the Geneva convention which preclude the use of coerced evidence in judical proceedings. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/07/01/theyre-supid-and-ugly-and-nobody-likes-them">Jane Hamsher</a> continues the discussion and points this out from the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/30/AR2006063001737.html">WaPo</a> story:</p>
<blockquote><p>A Washington Post-ABC poll this week suggested that while Americans continue to favor holding suspects at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, they are leery of an administration policy that has resulted in almost all of the 450 detainees being held without charges. Of those polled, 71 percent said the detainees should be either given POW status or charged with a crime.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – the American people understand this issue even if some of the partisan hacks in the GOP do not.</p>
<p>Update II: it seems our favorite troll has a narrow definition of who is a POW.  Read Article IV, which has a much broader definition.  It seems certain GOP hacks lack an ability to even read the clear words of the Geneva Convention at issue.  Yet, they lecture the justices of the Supreme Court?</p>
