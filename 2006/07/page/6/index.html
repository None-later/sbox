                                                                    </div>

                                <p>In its July 4th <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2006-07-04-our-toll-roads_x.htm">op-ed</a>, USA Today writes:<br />
<blockquote>In the past decade, usage of interstates rose by more than 30%, according to the Department of Transportation, while additions of routes and added lanes increased capacity by only 4%. The problem is simple. Gasoline taxes and tolls, already unpopular, provide a fraction of the money needed to keep traffic from getting worse. Now comes an idea to get around this problem. A number of states, most visibly Indiana, have proposed leasing major toll roads to private companies. By doing so, they can raise billions of dollars needed to make road improvements elsewhere. Ideally, such leases would not be necessary. Governments would give highways and public transit systems the funds they need, and they would not shy away from raising the requisite money from the people who use them. That would ensure a network of efficient, carefully integrated transportation systems in ways that a more piecemeal approach cannot. But given the extreme resistance, which dates back decades and shows no signs of abating, leases are the best option for easing gridlock.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, governments could continue to own the roads and collect toll revenues over time.  The op-ed goes onto cite the Indiana deal, which raised $3.8 billion but did not address the original question raised by <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002282.html">Max Sawicky</a>:<br />
<blockquote>When a government takes a lump sum in exchange for permitting a private firm to manage a road and levy tolls, it is not only privatizing. It is borrowing, worsening its fiscal position. Most states are looking at growing budget shortfalls in the future, as Medicaid costs in particular continue to grow more rapidly than their revenues. The Gov could just as easily contract out operations and management, but keep the tolls for itself. The fact that the money is earmarked to new projects &#8211; investment &#8211; is irrelevant. It&#8217;s still borrowing. You could just as easily keep the roads and float a bond &#8211; also borrowing &#8211; for the new projects. The leasing is not necessary. The political onus against explicit borrowing can warp decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bet the our favorite troll will claim he has addressed the question even if he hasn’t yet to address <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/indiana-toll-road-efficiency-gains.html">my questions</a> about the Crowe Chizek DCF model, which is the whole basis for Governor Daniels’ claim that the Cintra and Macquarie offer was a better deal for the state than <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2138950/?nav=fo">Daniel Gross</a> thinks. </p>
<p>To its credit – USAToday does not try to claim they have refutes the argument from Daniel Gross.</p>

                                <p>If <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWQ5NGNjYzcwMmZkMGJhYWIyOGM0ZTMwYzQ4N2EyZTM=">Jonah Goldberg</a> is “all in favor of a free press”, then why does he continue to attack John Harwood and William Safire?  Could this be it:<br />
<blockquote>And of course, there’s partisan cynicism and hypocrisy at play. (The White House loves to leak beneficial information to the press.) But there are merits to press criticism as well. What infuriates me is how anybody who raises these criticisms is caught in a Catch-22. It works like this: The media gets to reveal anything it wants for any reason it sees fit in the name of “the people’s right to know.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The National Review should change its name to Hypocrisy ‘R Us.  Take for example the time when John Aschroft tried to attack Jamie Gorelick during the 9-11 Commission hearings.  Who did the Administration turn to when they wanted to leak a classified memo – the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/levin/levin200404151634.asp">National Review</a>.   The National Review lied here just as they have repetitively lied in regards PlameGate, which involves the leaking of the name of a CIA agent.  But as noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/meet-press-bill-bennett-bloodied.html">here</a>, Jonah Goldberg sees no problem with the outing of CIA agents when it’s time to defend the partisans in the White House.  </p>
<p>Notice this portion of Jonah’s latest:<br />
<blockquote>It is telling that the only leak that troubles the press and its cheerleaders is the Valerie Plame leak. When Dana Priest revealed the location of secret “CIA prisons,” she was rewarded with a Pulitzer. When Lichtblau and James Risen disclosed the NSA surveillance program, they got Pulitzers, too. These revelations caused serious damage to America’s ability to work with allies to fight terrorism and arguably put lives in danger. And yet the only leak to scandalize the media establishment was Plame’s identity as a CIA employee. Why? Because it (allegedly) exposed the only serious enemy America faces: Karl Rove.</p></blockquote>
<p>Goldberg is repeating Bill Bennett’s malarkey, which Dana Priest thoroughly refuted.  And you might recall that when he attacked me for suggesting that the outing of the identity of CIA agents risked their lives and undermined our ability to collect intelligence (this time on Iran’s nuclear intentions), he wrote this:<br />
<blockquote>But since these leaks don&#8217;t promise to hurt Bush or get Karl Rove in trouble they are not &#8220;beyond the pale,&#8221; rather according to this guy, such leaks are in fact the bread and butter of a free society.</p></blockquote>
<p>We love you too Jonah &#8211; but let’s get two things straight.  In my view, Al Qaeda is the enemy.  In your view, those independents, Democrats, and even Republicans (e.g., Harwood and Safire) who actually do want a free press are the enemies.  After all, the only reason you are attacking Harwood and Safire is that’s exactly what Karl Rove wants you to do.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I have failed to mention that <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/07/the_degeneracy_.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> has been defending the First Amendment as well – even as Jonah Goldberg <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YjIyZmQ2OWIwMDM2OTFiN2I0OGIwYWYzNDBmZmIxM2U=">attacks</a> Sulli with: <br />
<blockquote>I am trying to maintain my restraint in taking Andrew Sullivan&#8217;s endless baiting seriously.  But this argument-and fact-free-tantrum really is a jewel of the genre. I particularly like the use of the word &#8220;hysterical&#8221; amidst all the talk about degenerate souls and tyranny.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we’ve seen on this issue as well as others – Goldberg’s source for “facts” is what ever spin Karl Rove is promoting that day.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/008924.php">Josh Marshall</a> is worried that President Bush will flip-flop as he reads <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/washington/05immig.html?hp&#038;ex=1152072000&#038;en=28fa86c3b555be31&#038;ei=5094&#038;partner=homepage">this story</a>: <br />
<blockquote>President Bush is signaling a new willingness to negotiate with House Republicans in an effort to revise the stalled legislation before Election Day. Republicans both inside and outside the White House say Mr. Bush, who has long insisted on comprehensive reform, is now open to a so-called enforcement-first approach that would put new border security programs in place before creating a guest worker program or path to citizenship for people living in the United States illegally.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Corner Kids over at the <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YzRmYjgxYjllOTU1OTZiNWQ1N2IwYzRiNjMzZjc4Njg=">National Review</a> &#8211; whose free markets philosophy specifically excludes free mobility of labor for Hispanics – are elated that Bush might put partisan politics above what once seemed his sole principled stance on policy.  </p>
<p>Speaking of making all things partisan, we see <a href="http://justoneminute.typepad.com/main/2006/07/kaus_get_result.html">Tom Maguire</a> cannot resist:<br />
<blockquote>Hmm &#8211; are the Democrats planning to both attack a do-nothing Republican Congress and oppose an enforcement-only bill?  Or might a Republican compromise expose some rifts on the Democratic side?</p></blockquote>
<p>Shorter Tom – a bad bill which helps drum up division and hate to aid the Republicans in November is better than no bill at all.  This Democrat is hoping that we hold out for the Senate version, which is a far superior approach, and short of that, oppose the very bad bill put forth by the House.  Shorter PGL – doing nothing is better than a very bad bill.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The leader of the Republicans in the House is John A. Boehner who is from Ohio.  Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/house_may_allow.html">Mark Thoma</a> (“The Democrats are accused of a cynical ploy by Republicans? That&#8217;s funny”) comes <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/washington/articles/2006/07/04/house_gop_leaders_say_vote_on_minimum_wage_now_likely">Rick Klein</a> with some goods news on the minimum wage increase proposal:<br />
<blockquote>With Democrats plotting to make the minimum wage a major issue in this fall&#8217;s congressional races, House Republican leaders are conceding that they may have to yield to pressure for an increase to the federal standard, which has been frozen for nearly a decade. Faced with elections that could cost them control of Congress, John A. Boehner, the House majority leader, acknowledged Thursday that Republican leaders are likely to reverse course and hold a vote on a proposed minimum wage increase. Though Boehner said it was a &#8220;cynical ploy&#8221; for Democrats to make it a campaign centerpiece, polls indicate that voters clearly favor an increase in the wage, and Boehner acknowledged that GOP leaders are &#8220;probably going to have to find some way to deal with it.&#8221; A week earlier, Boehner, an Ohio Republican, all but ruled out allowing a vote on the matter, saying an increase is &#8220;very bad economic policy.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if the average blue collar worker in Ohio agrees with Mr. Boehner:<br />
<blockquote>In the House, Democrats are trying to attach a minimum-wage increase to any bill they can to force the GOP&#8217;s hand on an issue that splits their party. Representative Nancy Pelosi &#8211; the minority leader and a California Democrat poised to become House speaker if her party wins this fall &#8211; has pledged to boost the minimum wage on the first day of a Democratic-controlled Congress. &#8220;This issue is a clear winner for Democrats if the Republicans continue to oppose it,&#8221; said the House minority whip, Steny H. Hoyer, a Maryland Democrat. &#8220;We want to have a change in America. We want to have a focus on working men and women.&#8221; Already, Democratic candidates in a range of House races have hammered their Republican opponents over the stalled minimum wage proposal. The issue has been emphasized in economically struggling parts of the country, including working-class districts in Ohio, Pennsylvania, upstate New York, and parts of New England.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, we get the usual argument that unless the real value of the minimum wage is eroded by inflation, we cannot reduce the unemployment rate:<br />
<blockquote>The federal minimum wage has languished at $5.15 an hour since 1997, and inflation has eroded its value to its lowest level in 50 years, according to independent economic studies. Democrats, led by Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, want to raise the wage to $7.25 an hour, but Republicans who say the increase is a job-killer have used a variety of procedural means to block a straight vote on any such proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that Boehner is from Ohio, I checked the BLS data on Ohio’s unemployment rate.  During the four years after the last time we increased the nominal minimum wage, Ohio’s unemployment rate fell from 5% to 4%.  After President Bush took office, Ohio’s unemployment rate rose with the recession and has slowly recovered.  With the very low real minimum wage rate, the May 2006 unemployment rate for Ohio was 5.3%.  Contrast this to the fact that the national unemployment rate was only 3.4% in late 1968 when we had the highest real value for the minimum wage in our history.  </p>
<p>I realize that economists have extensively debated the effect of changes in the real value of the minimum wage on employment – with little consensus.  But if the GOP leadership wants to tell the average voter that they oppose a restoration of the real value of the minimum wage – I invite them to do so – especially in Ohio.</p>

<p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/07/june-near-record-increase-in-national.html">CalculatedRisk</a> continues his excellent coverage of how rapidly the total Federal debt has been increasing:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the first nine months of the 2006 fiscal year (starts Oct 1st), the National Debt has increased $487.3 Billion. The record is $491.1 Billion for the first nine months of fiscal 2004 … If someone says the deficit is falling &#8211; laugh (or cry). Its not true.</p></blockquote>
<p>The comment section provides a couple of interesting links.  CR reader Belinda has some hope for our fiscal future after reading the <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2006/06/robust_growth_c.html">Skeptical Optimist</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I continue to wonder why more politicians don’t pick up on the overwhelming importance of economic growth.  I’ve recalibrated the Debt Clock (at upper right) accordingly.  The revised growth rate, combined with a month of little change in debt, reduced the debt-to-GDP ratio by a full half point from 65.1% to 64.6%.</p></blockquote>
<p>His <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2005/01/national_debt_b.html">National Debt burden: Full history</a> provides a nice graph of the debt/GDP ratio since 1792, which makes the same point noted by Robert Barro in his 1979 Journal of Political Economy article “On the Determination of the Public Debt” &#8211; U.S. fiscal policy from 1789 to 1980 strived to retire any debt created during major wars or recessions.  Note this statement cannot be made about fiscal policy during the 1980’s or since 2001 – although we did have a temporary return to fiscal sanity during the 1990’s.  </p>
<p>Besides this very long-run historical chart, the Skeptical Optimist tries to provide us with a second by second account of the debt to GDP ratio, which is as absurd as it is ambitious.  We observed GDP only at quarterly intervals.  In that vein, I provide a graph of the debt to GDP ratio by quarter since early 2000.  I cannot provide an observation for 2006QII even if CR has given us the numerator already because the BEA will not provide us a measure of the denominator for a while.  But notice something, the debt to GDP ratio was 64% as of 2005QIV and rose to 64.2% in 2006QI.  </p>
<p>CR reader Wimpie directs us to a chart provided by <a href="http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/conrad/2006/0630.html">Bud Conrad</a>.  This chart suggests the under current fiscal policy, Federal debt will continue to grow relative to GDP with the debt to GDP ratio surpassing 100% over the next generation.  Skeptical Optimist is optimistic that growth can keep the debt to GDP ratio can stay near 60%.  I remain skeptical unless we have some real political leadership in Washington, D.C.</p>

Dean notes:<br />
<blockquote>The one market that does seem to fit the competitive story reasonably well is agriculture. Farmers see a price in the market for corn, wheat, soybeans, etc. and they can sell as much as they choose at this price. Unfortunately, the Post apparently does not believe that agriculture is a competitive market.  It reports today that the United States is trying to open up markets in developing countries in order to give U.S. farmers something to offset the loss of subsidies in a new W.T.O. agreement. Sorry, this doesn’t make any sense. Farmers can already sell all they want in the market today at the prevailing price. It is unlikely that farmers will feel any better if the wheat they sell at $2.50 a bushel is going to Zambia than if it’s going to Pennsylvania. Perhaps the article meant that by opening up markets in Zambia, and other developing countries, the price of wheat would rise. It doesn’t seem very likely that the new markets would produce any substantial rise in price (the new entrants would be relatively small compared to the existing world market), but this would be a qualitatively different effect than simply an increase in the quantity of wheat sold. It would mean that all of us would be paying more for wheat. This could lead a more efficient world market, but it would also mean higher prices for consumers in the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean was referring to this passage:</p>
<blockquote><p>The United States is especially adamant that tariffs on agricultural goods must come down sharply; on that issue, its strongest adversaries include rich nations such as the European Union and Japan. The Bush administration wants to give American farmers new opportunities for shipping their products abroad &#8211; a political necessity, in the administration&#8217;s view, to offset the losses some farmers would suffer from cuts in government subsidy payments that would be part of a final Doha-round deal. The subsidy programs of rich countries are widely blamed for leading to overproduction of crops that depresses prices on world markets, hurting farmers in the developing world.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the competitive market for agricultural products is plagued with subsidies from the US as well as tariffs from the EU as well as many other places.  In my view, we should be drastically reducing tariffs on agricultural products as the Bush Administration is calling for – just as we should be eliminating US subsidies.  </p>
<p>Blustein also notes:<br />
<blockquote>Undercutting the U.S. free-trade position, however, is the accusation of hypocrisy. The administration&#8217;s critics note that its negotiators are seeking to shelter U.S. textile and apparel companies from the impact of a proposal that would eliminate all duties and quota limitations on products made in several dozen very poor nations, most of which are in sub-Saharan Africa. Although by some estimates the &#8220;duty-free, quota-free&#8221; proposal could give a major boost to the anti-poverty impact of the Doha round, U.S. textile makers fear that they would be hurt by a flood of imports from some of the poor countries, especially Bangladesh and Cambodia. So the administration is insisting on the right to exempt a small number of products from the plan &#8211; exactly the sort of protection for powerful interests that U.S. officials decry in other countries&#8217; policies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe we can put this deal on the table – an elimination of the tariffs on apparel and textile products in exchange for an elimination of Asian Central Bank mercantilism.</p>

<blockquote>There is no evidence from any of them that large-scale immigration generates large-scale economic benefits for the existing population as a whole. On the contrary, all the research suggests that the benefits are either close to zero, or negative … The injection of large numbers of unskilled workers into the economy does not benefit the bulk of the population to any great extent. It benefits the nanny-and housecleaner-using classes; it benefits employers who want to pay low wages; but it does not benefit indigenous, unskilled Britons, who have to compete with immigrants willing to work hard for very low wages in unpleasant working conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>A longer version of his thinking on this issue can be found <a href="http://www.civitas.org.uk/pdf/Rowthorn_Immigration.pdf">here</a>.  His description sounds very much like what the research suggests as far as immigration into the United States. However, as <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/03/north_of_the_bo.html">Brad DeLong</a> noted:<br />
<blockquote>I think that we should focus on: &#8220;the net benefits&#8230; from immigration, aside from the large gains to the immigrants themselves, are small.&#8221; Particularly, we should focus on the &#8220;large gains to the immigrants themselves.&#8221; The net benefits from immigration including the large gains to the immigrants themselves are enormous. We shouldn&#8217;t forget that. We should be taking steps to equalize America&#8217;s income distribution: more progressive tax brackets, more public provision of services, a more generous Earned Income Tax Credit, a higher minimum wage, a greater focus on education. But tight restrictions on immigration are a really lousy anti-poverty policy: one with enormous excess burdens measured in money, and truly mammoth excess burdens measured in utility.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rowthorn wonders why the UK Labor Party favors immigration.  I wonder why the US Democratic Party is not following Brad’s suggestions.  </p>
<p><a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2006/04/migrants_help.html">New Economist</a> cited several stories alleging favorable macroeconomic effects from UK immigration back in April.</p>

<blockquote><p>But Bill Bennett mentioned this on his show this morning. The New York Times alerted readers where one of Don Rumsfeld&#8217;s hidden security cameras is at his home. I bet they wouldn&#8217;t do that to Barbra Streisand.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment051600c.html">National Review</a> did mention Barbra as they told us about Rosie O’Donnell’s vacation location:</p>
<blockquote><p>A few years ago, the &#8220;Queen of Nice,&#8221; Rosie O&#8217;Donnell, gushed that Barbra Streisand was &#8220;my hero, idol, god, queen.&#8221; The two do share certain political characteristics. In 1996, Ms. O&#8217;Donnell expressed concern that she had revealed herself — on the air — as a Democrat. &#8220;&#8216;I thought: &#8216;Uh-oh. . . . I&#8217;m gonna get letters from Republicans about this.&#8217; Then I realized: &#8216;What Republicans are watching daytime television? They&#8217;re too busy tryin&#8217; to make more money than anybody else.'&#8221; Well, I know a lot of Republicans who would be hard pressed to make more money that Ms. O&#8217;Donnell. Consider: In 1996, she purchased theatre legend Helen Hayes&#8217;s 22-room Nyack, NY mansion for $770,000, spent some $300,000 on renovations, and now has the estate back on the market for $2.75 million. Last year, Ms. O&#8217;Donnell purchased an 8,000-square-foot weekend and vacation home on Miami&#8217;s super-exclusive Star Island for $6.75 million. This is where she keeps her six personal watercraft.</p></blockquote>
<p>No mention of the security cameras, however.  More on this fake controversy from <a href="http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/07/what-is-left-of-malkin-hinderaker-and.html">Glenn</a>.  I hope you are enjoying the July 4th extended weekend free from publicity!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/001046.php">Justin Rood</a> seems to be a bit outraged at this:<br />
<blockquote>Yes, that&#8217;s a mock-up of the New York &#8220;Crimes&#8221; publishing the location of Anne Frank&#8217;s secret hiding place. Now, I&#8217;m confused. (And yes, I know that the New York Crimes is not the name of a real newspaper.) The government&#8217;s counterterror programs are like Anne Frank? I called Free Republic&#8217;s Kristinn Taylor, who said his group was responsible for the sign (&#8220;We made that one up,&#8221; he told me). Could he explain it? &#8220;Basically, it&#8217;s a satire on what the New York Times would be publishing during World War II if they had the same attitudes they have now,&#8221; he said. Ignoring for the moment that the New York Times published all through World War II, and did not once reveal the location of Anne Frank&#8217;s hideout, I asked him: So, is Anne Frank analogous to government counterterror programs? &#8220;Probably not an exact one,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;It&#8217;s just the idea that what they&#8217;re doing now will get people killed. [It&#8217;s] equivalent to [how] revealing Anne Frank&#8217;s location to the Nazis would get her killed.&#8221; I don&#8217;t mean to dwell on this point. But does anyone really think that Anne Frank is the right choice to be the literal poster child for government programs involving kidnapping, torture, warrantless searches, and denial of legal due process?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://michellemalkin.com/archives/005479.htm">Michelle Malkin</a> seems elated at some other pathetic signs.  If Michelle wants not involved with some bogus story, how would she spend her name?  Don’t answer that – as I’m not sure I want to ruin my holidays.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>On <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13615446">Meet the Press</a>, Senator McConnell opined on the Hamdan decision and the Geneva Conventions:</p>
<blockquote><p>And second, a very disturbing aspect of the decision was that the Court held Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applicable to American servicemen … But the, but the, but the enemy is not a signatory to the, to the, to the Geneva Conventions, so why should these terrorists be subjected to something they’re not signatories to?</p></blockquote>
<p>As the author of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/on-geneva-conventions.html">this post</a>, I screamed:<br />
<blockquote>What part of “Although one of the Powers in conflict may not be a party to the present Convention, the Powers who are parties thereto shall remain bound by it in their mutual relations” do these rightwingers not understand?</p></blockquote>
<p>But take a look at the <a href="http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/tribunals/hamdanrums110804opn.pdf">Hamdan decision</a>, which noted: (a) Afghanistan signed the treaty; (b) the government’s attempt to separate the Taliban and Al Qaeda in regards this issue; and (c) the clause from the Third Geneva Convention that I screamed at my TV.  </p>
<p>Then I was reading <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_07/009118.php">Kevin Drum</a> nobly say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, I&#8217;m a Democrat, and I&#8217;ll say it: anyone we capture on a battlefield should be subject to the minimum standards of decency outlined in the Geneva Conventions. That includes terrorists. It&#8217;s our way of telling the world that we aren&#8217;t barbarians; that we believe in minimal standards of human decency even if our enemies don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s also a necessary &#8211; though not sufficient &#8211; requirement for winning this war.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kevin was reacting to the latest stupidity from <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTE5ODM0ZDVjYjdmMzUwZTAzZjFmNTc4NTA1MTQ3NTU=">Jonah Goldberg</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>And I say this as somone who basically sees nothing wrong with making a political issue out of the Hamdan decision. If Democrats want terrorists to fall under the Geneva Convention let them say so. My guess is most won&#8217;t, if they&#8217;re smart.</p></blockquote>
<p>How to react?  Do we remind Mr. Goldberg that he should actually READ the Geneva Conventions or the Court’s decision in Hamdan before he offers his uninformed opinion again?  Or do we make the simple point that war should not be a partisan issue?  Oh never mind that as Jonah’s M.O. is Partisan ‘R Us.  The only way Jonah’s dismissal of Al Qaeda not being covered is the proposition that we are longer at war with Al Qaeda.  President Bush once claimed we were, which made the Geneva Conventions applicable here – at least to anyone who knows how to read.  Now if the Republicans want to say we were never serious about being at war with Al Qaeda – make that case.  But for someone so ignorant of what the heck he is talking about – I’d be silent if I were Jonah Goldberg.  But hey – opining on things he has not even bothered to read is Goldberg’s sole talent.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mitch McConnell is a U.S. Senator and the citizens of Kentucky deserve better than what they saw on Meet the Press.</p>
<p>Update: A <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/lowry/lowryprint012902.html">Rich Lowry</a> classic on Gitmo and the Geneva Conventions from 1/29/2002:<br />
<blockquote>The Geneva Convention of 1949 was meant to regulate international warfare between states, with some basic provision for civil wars as well. What the U.S. is engaging in today is something different, a war against an organization of terrorists who do not constitute a government, rendering the Geneva Convention essentially irrelevant. The conflict between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance, which was indeed a more traditional civil war, became a subset of this larger, new kind of warfare: the war against terror, against armed international gangs. The Geneva Convention is built around the idea of detaining prisoners of war who are not suicidal terrorists, who are instead civilized men who &#8211; perhaps under duress &#8211; performed a service to their nation and are willing actually to surrender once they surrender.</p></blockquote>
<p>But you want to interrupt and talk about fair trials.  Rich?<br />
<blockquote>In an effort to slip a Geneva requirement into Guantanamo, administration critics — a category in which I would generally include Colin Powell — maintain that we are violating the Convention if we don&#8217;t convene panels, as called for by the treaty, to determine whether each individual detainee in Guantanamo is an unlawful combatant or not. The Defense Department actually has a long-standing rule for conducting such hearings. But if the Geneva Convention doesn&#8217;t apply, this requirement obviously doesn&#8217;t apply either. And the question of whether the convention applies or not cannot be determined by panel of military officers on a case-by-case basis. It is a matter of state policy to be determined at the highest levels of government. If the U.S. decides that al Qaeda and the Taliban don&#8217;t qualify &#8211; which, so far, is the administration position &#8211; there is no need to have a Geneva-mandated hearing for every detainee in Guantanamo. Now, the question of whether the Convention should apply to the Taliban gets a little complicated, but the Taliban seems to flunk all the major tests. First, the Taliban were not a signatory to the treaty.</p></blockquote>
<p>The state of Afghanistan was a signatory to the treaty.  As far as whether the Geneva Conventions call for a fair trial apply to the Taliban and their allies known as Al Qaeda, Mr. Lowry put faith in the Executive Branch and not the Courts.  Interesting.  If Colin Powell disagreed back then, good for him!</p>
<p>Update II: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzRlODZjNjQ5M2U1ZDI2ZjhlYWRmZmRjNGY2ODU4M2E=">Jonah Goldberg</a> agrees with the higher standards argument but then writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Geneva Convention requires that we give detainees razors and forbids keeping them in cells. Surely reasonable people can hold the position that applying these provisions to Jihadi fanatics is unwise &#8230; But we do have rules. Hundreds of detainees have been released.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hamdan was not about toiletries – it was about granting those held fair trials.  While Jonah is right about the U.S. having “rules” such as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/gitmo-trials-lets-help-senator-john.html">Article 36 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice</a>, the problem is that the Administration decided to abandon those rules.  If Jonah is calling for a return to those rules, he is agreeing with the Court decision he once criticized.</p>

<blockquote>Even though Donald R. Matthews put his sprawling new residence in the heart of rice country, he is no farmer. He is a 67-year-old asphalt contractor who wanted to build a dream house for his wife of 40 years.Yet under a federal agriculture program approved by Congress, his 18-acre suburban lot receives about $1,300 in annual &#8220;direct payments,&#8221; because years ago the land was used to grow rice.</p></blockquote>
<p>Credit goes to <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MGI4Yzg1MTdjMWE1OTdlZGRjYTBhZmY4M2JjMWM2ZTE=">Stephen Spruiell</a> for this:<br />
<blockquote>Just to put this in perspective, the non-farming sectors of the U.S. economy make up between 80 to 90 percent of the GDP. Yet through its actions, the U.S. government is saying that it is willing to forgo new market openings for its most productive sectors so that wealthy landowners can continue to receive lots of money not to farm.</p></blockquote>
<p>The WaPo story notes that these farm subsidies cost the Federal government $25 billion in 2005.  I realize that reducing $25 billion per year is just a drop in the bucket as far as addressing our current Federal fiscal fiasco – but liberals and conservatives seem to be in consensus that these subsidies should be eliminated.</p>
