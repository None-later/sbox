                                <p>Noumenon ask over at <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/07/advice_for_demo.html">Mark Thoma’s</a> blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>Excuse me, I can see from Google that you have criticized Lawrence Kudlow in the past. Can you explain how he can claim that &#8220;over the past 11 quarters &#8230; America has increased the size of its entire economy by 20 percent?&#8221; Because that seems to imply a 6% growth rate and it&#8217;s only been like 3.5%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Real GDP as of 2006QI was only 11.5% higher than it was as of 2005QII so Noumenon is correct.  Here is what <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/07/the_bigbang_story_of_us_privat.html">Lawrence Kudlow</a> wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did you know that just over the past 11 quarters, dating back to the June 2003 Bush tax cuts, America has increased the size of its entire economy by 20 percent? In less than three years, the U.S. economic pie has expanded by $2.2 trillion, an output add-on that is roughly the same size as the total Chinese economy, and much larger than the total economic size of nations like India, Mexico, Ireland, and Belgium.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nominal GDP increased by 25% over this period but I guess Kudlow continues not to understand the difference between nominal v. real increases.  As far as the Chinese economy, the <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html">CIA World Factbook</a> reports its GDP (purchasing power parity) was $8.859 trillion in 2005.  </p>
<p>Kudlow has been long guilty of trying to tell his readers that Bush’s fiscal fiasco actually promotes investment and long-term growth even though the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/borrowing-is-not-necessarily-pro.html">facts</a> say otherwise.  As Brad DeLong often wonders – is it stupidity or mendacity?  It appears to be both.</p>
<p>Update: Even <a href="http://instapundit.com/#031307">Glenn Reynolds</a> got the point eventually – with a little help:</p>
<blockquote><p>Reader Daniel Amerman says that Kudlow didn&#8217;t include inflation, and that if you include inflation, the U.S. economic expansion was &#8220;only&#8221; 11.4 %. As Amerman says, “11.4% over 11 quarters is quite respectable in real terms, there is no need for misrepresentation and hyperbole.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Is Kudlow less intelligent than Glenn Reynolds or is Amerman correct that Kudlow misrepresented this issue.  Being called out by the rightwingers should be a single to the National Review that it is time to fire Lawrence Kudlow.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>How many ways can the folks at the National Review try to argue that Bush’s fiscal fiasco increases long-term growth rather than decreases it? <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTNmM2YwM2UzYmRlMDZlMDE0MDkyYmFmMzFhZTYwYzE=">William Kucewicz</a> tries another one:</p>
<blockquote><p>Net lending in the first quarter totaled a record $4.50 trillion (seasonally adjusted annual rate), up $457 billion, or 11.3 percent, from the previous quarter and $1.46 trillion, or 47.9 percent, above year-earlier levels, according to the Federal Reserve’s latest “Flow of Funds Accounts of the United States.” As a consequence of the Bush tax cuts on income and capital, total net lending (i.e., all credit market instruments excluding corporate equities) has risen $2.57 trillion, or a resounding 132.8 percent, in the past five years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kucewitz is referring to table F.1 from the Flow of Funds Accounts, which shows both net lending and net borrowing.  By definition, the totals are the same.  Now would it matter who is borrowing and for what purpose?  Since Kucewitz does really address this issue, let’s pose the following query.  Suppose that the government decided to increase its borrowing by $100 billion.  What would be the effect on savings and investment?  I can think of five possible answers here:</p>
<p>Answer 1.  A Ricardian Equivalence type might argue it does not affect national savings as households increase private savings by the increase in the government deficit as they recognize that the rising Federal debt represents future tax liabilities.  Of course, George W. Bush wanted to give people their money back so they can consume more as he pretends his tax cuts are permanent.</p>
<p>Answer 2. A closed economy classical would suggest that any rise in consumption (fall in national savings) would completely crowd-out investment.  </p>
<p>Answer 3. An open economy classical model would suggest that part of the crowding-out would be in the form of reduced net exports partially offsetting the crowding-out of investment so the reduction in national savings from massive government borrowing might take the form of more lending to the U.S. from the rest of the world.  </p>
<p>Answer 4: If the economy began from a state of high unemployment, a Keynesian might argue the fiscal stimulus would increase overall production back towards full employment with the prospect of the paradox of thrift suggesting that a downward shift in the national savings schedule would also induce a favorable movement along the savings schedule.  </p>
<p>Answer 5: The National Review crowd wants us to believe that national savings rose as if people are consuming less.  Not only does this premise contradict the rhetoric of the President they worship, it is also contrary to the facts.  When economists raise the concept of crowding-out, the National Review crowd seemingly says what crowding-out.  </p>
<p>The following graph shows investment as a share of GDP from 2000 to 2005 as well as imports net of exports (labeled TB for trade balance deficit) as a share of GDP, and gross savings (GS which is the sum of investment and net exports) as a share of GDP.  Answer 3 seems to capture the long-run picture with some Keynesian elements thrown in as the economy fell below full employment from 2001 to 2003 only to at least partially return to full employment by now.  We had a rather dramatic fall in the national savings rate, which mainly crowded out net exports but also crowded investment.  </p>

<p>Our second graph displays net lending (= net borrowing) as a percent of GDP, which did increase from 17% in 2000 to over 27% in 2005 as Kucewicz’s discussion notes (although expressing the numbers in terms of nominal figures and not relative to GDP sort of exaggerates things).  While Kucemicz fails to mention this fact, our graph shows about half of the increase represents an increase in government borrowing or put differently an increase in the amount of net lending from the rest of the world. </p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a2-782364.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/a2-773108.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>But you may ask – what about the rest of the increase in net lending?  Kucewicz charts the increase in the debt to equity ratio as he writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Finance is the sine qua non of economic growth. Without it, risk-taking is stymied, knowledge can’t be commercialized, and an economy stagnates &#8230; New corporate bond issues in the first quarter topped $965.8 billion (seasonally adjusted annual rate), up 3.9 percent, or $36.2 billion, from the prior quarter and a smashing 50.6 percent, or $324.7 billion, higher than a year before. Throughout much of the first half of the decade, corporations took advantage of low U.S. interest rates by switching from equity to bond financing. In the first quarter, in fact, equity financing totaled about $99 billion, down almost 73 percent, or $267 billion, from a year earlier.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, much of the increase in borrowing represents corporations paying out retained earnings to shareholders.  At this point, we have to mention the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modigliani-Miller_theorem">Modigliani-Miller propositions</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>the value of a firm is unaffected by how that firm is financed. It does not matter if the firm&#8217;s capital is raised by issuing stock or selling debt. It does not matter what the firm&#8217;s dividend policy is.</p></blockquote>
<p>A shift from equity to debt financing might indeed increase the amount of risk borne by equity owners but the Modigliani-Miller propositions would hold that this change in method of financing is only a risk transfer. </p>
<p>Kucewicz fails to mention who is doing the additional borrowing and lending and what is driving the decision to increase borrowing.  Certainly, we have not witnessed an outward shift of the national savings schedule – regardless of how many distortions of the data the National Review can concoct.</p>

<blockquote><p>Footnotes don’t prove that claims are accurate until the footnotes are actually checked! And, starting on page one of her book, Coulter’s citations frequently show that her claims have been simply made up. Indeed, by the time Malcolm penned his recent review, it was perfectly clear that Coulter’s book was packed with factual howlers &#8230; Counting footnotes! Who would believe that such PlaySkool procedures could drive the American public discourse?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ms. Coulter’s publisher answered the recent charges about alleged plagiarism with <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200607070011">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We have reviewed the allegations of plagiarism surrounding Godless and found them to be as trivial and meritless as they are irresponsible. Any author is entitled to do what Ann Coulter has done in the three snippets cited: research and report facts. The number of words used by our author in these snippets is so minimal that there is no requirement for attribution. As an experienced author and attorney, Ms. Coulter knows when attribution is appropriate, as underscored by the nineteen pages of hundreds of endnotes contained in Godless.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nineteen pages with hundreds of endnotes! I just hope Crown Publishing has done a better job of insuring the author is reporting facts.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/07/charles_wheelan.html">Brad DeLong</a> comes <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/columnist/article/economist/4065">Charles Wheelan</a> who says you can’t lose weight by eating more as he mocks the Laffer curve:<br />
<blockquote>In this column, I&#8217;m focusing on bad economics. In fact, I&#8217;m going to write about what I consider to be the two worst economic ideas &#8211; or at least ideas that pass as economics, though both have been thoroughly repudiated by nearly all credible thinkers &#8230; Neither the Reagan nor the George W. Bush tax cuts were &#8220;self-financing,&#8221; as the Laffer disciples like to argue. According to The Economist &#8211; my former employer and no bastion of left-wing thought &#8211; the current Bush Administration&#8217;s top economist, Gregory Mankiw, estimated that decreasing taxes on labor would generate enough growth to recoup only about 17 cents for each lost dollar; a tax cut on capital is better, paying for more than half of itself. Still, the bottom line from the Bush Administration itself is that tax cuts reduce Uncle Sam&#8217;s take. So why does Laffer&#8217;s sketch on Dick Cheney&#8217;s cocktail napkin rank near the top of my list of bad economic ideas? Because, when applied to the U.S., it&#8217;s intellectually dishonest. The Laffer Curve offers the false promise that we can cut taxes without making any sacrifice on the spending side, and that&#8217;s simply not true. It&#8217;s the economic equivalent of arguing that you can lose weight by eating more. Let me be perfectly clear: I&#8217;m not arguing that tax cuts are bad. I&#8217;m simply pointing out that we can&#8217;t pretend that tax cuts won&#8217;t require reductions on the spending side to balance the budget. In fact, you can disregard every other argument in this column and think about one thing: If Laffer were right, lower taxes would never require any spending sacrifice. We could pay a mere one percent of our income in taxes and still fund all of our government spending &#8212; and maybe more! Do you think that&#8217;s really possible? This column should give you a hint of why economics is called the dismal science &#8211; it&#8217;s all about tradeoffs. We&#8217;re the ones telling you that if you get more of something, you probably have to get less of something else. Whether it&#8217;s tax policy or dieting, you can&#8217;t have your cake and lose weight, too, which is why America currently has huge deficits and a lot of fat people.</p></blockquote>

In a somewhat similar vein, <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/07/reviving_the_generals_revolt.html">Jed Babbin</a> has a Karl Rove pre-approved discussion of &#8220;Fiasco: The American Adventure in Iraq&#8221; by Tom Risen:<br />
<blockquote>The Clintons &#8211; and the plural is more accurate than the singular &#8211; picked generals for their political fealty rather than military prowess. The worst public examples were Wesley Clark (a Friend of Bill from their Oxford Rhodes scholar days), and Anthony Zinni … The least public and most political general is former Army Chief of Staff Gen. Eric Shinseki.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wesley Clark used to be a Republican.  I think Anthony Zinni still is.  I have no clue whether Eric Shinseki is a Democrat, Republican, or independent and quite frankly I don’t care.  All three men served our nation with distinction for many years.  Babbin’s smear jobs of these three patriots stand in stark contrast to the facts regarding the careers of each. </p>
<p>It is not surprising that Babbin cites an op-ed by <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2006/04/seven_days_in_april_generals_p.html">Tony Blankley</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Consider two hypothetical situations. In the first, a United States Army general officer in a theater of war decides by himself that he strongly disagrees with the orders of the secretary of defense. He resigns his commission, returns to private life and speaks out vigorously against both the policy and the secretary of defense.  In example two, the top 100 generals in the Army military chain of command secretly agree amongst themselves to retire and speak out &#8211; each one day after the other.  In example one, above, unambiguously, the general has behaved lawfully. In example two, an arguable case could be made that something in the nature of a mutinous sedition has occurred in violation of Article 94 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice procedure. When does an expanded version of the simple honesty and legality of the first example cross over into grounds for a court martial?</p></blockquote>
<p>Blankley tries to smear these former generals as deserving a court martial but in every case, he has the facts wrong. Clark and Zinni both retired in 2000 and Shinseki did publicly air his differences with Secretary Rumsfeld.  It is now clear that Shinseki got it right about how many troops would be needed in Iraq and Rumsfeld was horribly mistaken.  This is clear to most people but not to Jed Babbin or to <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OTI0ZmU0NWM3M2E1Mjc3OGZhNjMwZGZiYTdlZWMwMDA=">Cliff May</a> who seems to want to blame all of Bush’s numerous failures on Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>As Cliff May and Jeb Babbin try to defend Bush’s decision to invade Iraq without a real plan for the aftermath, might they try to blame <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060706/wl_nm/iraq_maliki_dc_2">this</a> on Clinton as well:<br />
<blockquote>BAGHDAD (Reuters) – Iraq’s prime minister urged the U.S. military on Thursday to keep &#8220;reckless&#8221; troops from serving in Iraq in order to prevent abuses like the alleged rape and murder of a teenager and her family by U.S. soldiers in March. </p></blockquote>
<p>Congresman Murtha is correct – it’s time to bring our soldiers home.</p>

<p>The unemployment rate was unchanged even though the employment to population ratio increased from 63% to 63.1% as the labor force participation rate increased from 66.1% to 66.2%.  It seems the reported employment increase for the Household Survey was 387 thousand.  </p>
<p>Employment for the construction and retail trade sectors actually declined as the other sectors reported modest increases in employment.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/07/07/news/economy/jobs_june/index.htm">Chris Isidore</a> reports on the reactions of a few economists who share the concern about an allegedly strong labor market coming from the Federal Reserve:<br />
<blockquote>The wage gain also represents a 3.9 percent year-over-year rise, the biggest gain in that measure since June 2001. That could be seen as being inflationary, and could prompt the Federal Reserve to keep raising interest rates in an effort to cool the economy and keep prices in check.</p></blockquote>
<p>I want to simply scream that this is absolutely absurd, but let me turn the microphone over to <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_07/009140.php">Kevin Drum</a>: <br />
<blockquote>inflation over the past 12 months has clocked in at about 4.1%, so a 3.9% rise in nominal wages is a decrease in real wages. This is the &#8220;wage spike&#8221; the Fed is supposed to be concerned about. Riddle me this: if the Fed tries to put the brakes on wages every time they creep up from negative to zero, what will hourly wages look like over the long term? Answer: consistently down. Which is exactly what they&#8217;ve looked like over the past several decades. The overall economy is doing fine. Growth is strong, productivity is strong, corporate profits are strong, CEO compensation is stratospheric. There&#8217;s plenty of new wealth being created. The problem is that financial markets and the Federal Reserve are bound and determined to make sure that none of this new wealth makes its way into the hands of the middle class. That&#8217;s why, in our looking-glass world, a real wage decline of -0.2% is described as an increase.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Well said!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MzEzMzZlZDE4MjNmN2Q2MDFmZTk4YTllMjhkM2YzMmY=">KLo</a> over at The Corner (NRO) beat this West Coast bear to reporting the June employment news as she cited a summary from the JEC, which included as its last bullet point:<br />
<blockquote>Average hourly earnings increased by 8 cents in June and have risen over the past year by 3.9 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>So as Kevin Drum noted, nominal wages rose by less than the increase in prices, which means real wages declined.  I guess it was too early for either the JEC or KLo to check this out.</p>
<p><strong>Update III</strong>: <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/07/bush-jobs-brag">ThinkProgress</a> puts its all in perspective:<br />
<blockquote>The White House issued a fact sheet today on President Bush’s economic record. The headline blares “5.4 Million Jobs Created Since August 2003”.  The sheet suggests recent job growth proves President Bush’s economic strategy is a smashing success. <br />Let’s set aside for a moment that the “fact sheet” conveniently ignores the 22 months of jobs losses that proceeded August 2003. Instead, let’s put Bush’s job record since August 2003 in perspective:</p>
<p>1. Monthly job growth since August 2003 is 50% lower than the average of President Clinton’s entire term. Since August 2003, job growth has averaged 160,000 per month. During Clinton’s eight years in office job growth averaged 236,000 per month.  </p>
<p>2. Real wages have fallen since August 2003. The average worker’s real wages were twenty cents lower in June 2006 than they were in August 2003.</p>
<p>Any way you slice it, Bush’s economic policy has resulted in slower job growth and lower wages. That’s nothing to brag about. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>Many thanks to Mark Thoma for alerting me to an article by <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/07/06/owning_the_roads">Joseph M. Giglio</a>:<br />
<blockquote>WHEN THE federal government was preparing to build the interstate highway system, a commission appointed by President Eisenhower recommended it be built as toll roads, with the revenue used to cover ongoing operating costs, as well as debt service on the bonds issued to fund construction. But Congress decided interstates should be toll-free. Instead, it levied a tax on motor vehicle fuels and created the Highway Trust Fund as a repository for the revenue. Today, fuel tax revenues buy only about half as much construction as in the 1960s and &#8217;70s. Since 1980, vehicle miles traveled on the nation&#8217;s roadways have nearly doubled, but total lane miles have scarcely increased. The results are a growing gap between needs and available resources, and a rising percentage of roads that are in bad shape.</p></blockquote>
<p>Giglio, who is the author of “Mobility: America&#8217;s Transportation Mess and How to Fix it” and a member of the Massachusetts Transportation Finance Commission, continues by noting that different approaches are being tried to finance our roads in the future.  Does anyone recall whether President Eisenhower ever proposed that the U.S. government sell the rights to charging tolls to a private entity or was his proposal that the Federal government retain full ownership of these rights?</p>

                                <p>I may have to reconsider all the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/07/gitmo-trials-lets-help-senator-john.html">nice things</a> about Lindsey Graham after reading <a href="http://writ.lp.findlaw.com/dean/20060705.html">John Dean</a> describe the attempt to defraud the Supreme Court by Senators Graham and Kyl:<br />
<blockquote>The Hoax Fails: The Supreme Court Is Not Fooled</p>
<p>Hamdan&#8217;s lawyers, however, spotted the hoax. In their opposition to the motion to dismiss the case, they advised the Court that the supposedly conflicting legislative history was entirely invented after the fact, and that it consisted of &#8220;a single scripted colloquy that never actually took place, but was instead inserted into the record after the legislation had passed.&#8221; The brief noted, quite accurately, that this Graham-Kyl colloquy was &#8220;simply an effort to achieve after passage of the Act precisely what [they] failed to achieve in the legislative process.&#8221; Ultimately, the Supreme Court did not decide the jurisdictional issue until it rendered its full ruling on June 29 of this year. There, Justice Stevens concluded correctly that the Congress had not stripped the Court of jurisdiction with the DTA.  Out of an apparent concern for interbranch comity, the High Court has chosen to ignore the bogus brief filed by Senators Graham and Kyl, rather than reprimanding the Senators. Nevertheless, when Graham and Kyl sought to file the very same brief, a month later, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columba, Slate&#8217;s Emily Bazelon reports that court &#8220;issued an unusual order rejecting&#8221; their amicus brief alone, although they accepted five others. No one familiar with this remarkable behavior by Graham and Kyl can doubt why the court did not want to hear from these senators.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, Justice Scalia was fooled as was a particular troll who somehow thinks the whole Hamdan case revolved around the Detainee Treatment Act.  And not to be outdone &#8211; <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZGJiNWM3OTQ5OTRiMjMyOTJlMjJhNzdiOTk0OGZlZjU=">Byron York</a> shows us he is easily fooled by the subsequent spin from Senator Graham:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Justice Stevens took the plain language of the statute and made legal contortions to get to the result the Court wanted to get to,” South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham tells National Review Online. “It was turning statutory interpretation and the interpretation of a record upside down, in my opinion, to get a predetermined result. The majority of the Court wanted to rule on the legal situation in Guantanamo Bay, and no statute was going to get in their way.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only should the Court refuse to listen to Senators Graham and Kyl – their fellow Senators should ignore these two dishonest men.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/06/graham-unconstitutional">ThinkProgress</a> reads what Senator Graham is saying adding:<br />
<blockquote>What Graham is suggesting is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court has the final say on how treaties should be interpreted &#8230; It’s difficult for Graham and other loyal supporters of the Bush administration to accept that their legal approach to combating terrorism is dysfunctional. The Hamdan decision spelled this out.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the whole posts including the links.  For a Senator who talks about the “rule of law” so much, it’s a shame that Lindsey Graham is so willing to let the Constitution be undermined.</p>

                                <p>I began this World Cup cheering for Team USA, followed by cheering for Team Mexico, followed by cheering for Team Brazil.  I ended up cheering for my fifth favorite team – Italy (OK, Team Ireland is my second favorite team but they were not in the World Cup).  On the Fourth of July, Team Italy came through for me and now we congratulate <a href="http://soccernet.espn.go.com/section?id=worldcup&#038;cc=5901">France</a> even if someone who doest no understand soccer is pathetic enough to do some France <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZjE0YTNkNmVkMWE5NjMxODViN2NmMDM0NzMzMmYwMWE=">bashing</a> as his <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=YjIzYzA2N2Q4NDQ5MDVlNzRhYmE2ZmU2N2I2NzYyZjE=">colleague</a> does not understand the difference between a wonderful sport versus stupid partisan banter.</p>
<p>But this is really about a very nice post from <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/07/world-cup-apathy.html">Andrew Samwick</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first time I was aware of the World Cup was in 1994. I happened to be making my first trip to the UK … It was a fantastic trip, and I recall that year that the US and Ireland were in the tournament and doing well, but the English were not. You would hardly know this from fans in the pubs. They loved the game, and I drank for free, just for the novelty of being an American there while the team was doing well.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was in an Irish pub for the game between Ireland and Italy – and it was odd that the bartenders decided to go on strike but the beer still flowed as the Irish beat the Italians 1-0.  Andrew continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The single reason why I don&#8217;t care is that I see too many players faking like they are hurt to draw a yellow or red card for the opposing team (or to secure a penalty kick at close range). Not everyone who winds up on the grass is faking it, but too many of them are, and obviously so. Taking a dive may not be unique to soccer, but the extent to which it is manufactured and the advantage it confers when successful do seem to be larger in the World Cup than in other sports.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amen and a great example of this was some fellow on the UK team with the last name being Terry who was particularly pathetic during the game with Portugal.  Nothing against the English, but I was really happy that Portugal won.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/monthly/2006_07.php">Kevin Drum</a> has a nice post covering this game.</p>
<p>Also – nothing against the French but I’m cheering for the Italians on Sunday.  Let’s hope I didn’t just jinx their chances.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://festersplace.blogspot.com/2006/07/world-cup-flops-and-fouls.html">Fester</a> has another very nice post on the World Cup and points me to the <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/archive/2006_06_01__arch_file.htm#115148805101717077">SportsEconomist</a> who agrees with the AB readers that have noted that I’m about to cheer for some Italian floppers.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>So says <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NmY5YTdjYTFmYzIxOTg0MmI1ZjJiZjI0NTk2ZTQzY2U=">Robert Alt</a> of the National Review:<br />
<blockquote>The case was Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, and the victorious party was Osama bin Laden’s purported personal driver and bodyguard, Salim Ahmed Hamdan. Goldstein was not alone: From legal academia, to Capitol Hill, to the mainstream media, to the blogosphere, liberals have expressed undue exuberance concerning the outcome of Hamdan, and thereby reaffirmed why many Americans are reluctant to trust liberals on questions of national security.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court did not order the release of Mr. Hamdan.  Nor did it say we should not pursue al Qaeda.  What it did say was that our Constitution still matters and the concept of a fair trial is not a quaint idea.  This is what we liberals are celebrating.  Too bad the National Review’s view is that unless we crown Mr. Bush as King George I, Al Qaeda has won.  Yes, the National Review believes we must choose between security versus respect for our values as itemized by the Founding Fathers.  Some of us on the left – as well as many conservatives – think we can have both.  </p>
<p>Alt continues with what is likely to be Karl Rove’s theme for the upcoming elections:<br />
<blockquote>Despite the fact that the public generally trusts Republicans more on national-security issues than Democrats, the latter have been given a golden opportunity to capitalize on growing public disapproval of the Iraq war. But at every turn, liberals overreach, overreact, and, quite frankly, give the American people reason to distrust their judgment. Hamdan is just the latest example. While liberals enjoyed a short-lived victory before the Supreme Court, their excessive celebration is likely to bring about additional losses at the polls, cast by Americans who don’t think that the good guys won.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Alt is simply misrepresenting what the left (and many others) have said about Hamdan, note the Rovian claim that we Democrats can’t be trust with national security.  Of course, the truth is that this Administration has done a terrible job at reducing the Al Qaeda threat – as noted by <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_07/009127.php">Kevin Drum</a>.  We do know two things with certainty.  First, the Republican Party to date has shown that we can’t trust it with our liberties.  Secondly, the folks at the National Review will write ANYTHING that Karl Rove asks them to write – regardless of how dishonest and despicable it may be.</p>
