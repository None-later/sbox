                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/mcnickle/s_461925.html">Colin McNickle</a> has some very odd views on Social Security:<br />
<blockquote>Now he&#8217;s shilling for Americans United for (state your cause here). Its cause du jour &#8211; actually, a return to the group&#8217;s 2005 fight &#8211; is Social Security. That&#8217;s as in preserving, protecting and defending a quite onerous Big Government bait-and-switch racket that would make Charles K. Ponzi, father of the Ponzi scheme, most proud. How any educated person can believe that the current Social Security program &#8211; which, unaltered, goes belly up in 36 years &#8211; is anywhere close to sustainable surely is an exercise in believing that one can wipe with the water and wash with the towel … Among the first pols to be targeted by the barkers for socialistic preservation is Sen. Rick Santorum, in the fight of his political life against state Treasurer Bobby Casey Jr., who has never met an issue to which he couldn&#8217;t perform a sterling Gene Kelly salute. Granted, economics is not Mr. Santorum&#8217;s strong suit. How could it be, given his love of price controls (in the form of gasoline anti-price gouging and anti-&#8220;unfair pricing&#8221; legislation), his support of a higher minimum wage, his backing of the boondoggle that is Pittsburgh&#8217;s North Shore Connector and an expansive plan to subsidize higher education that will only encourage every college and university to jack up prices? But on Social Security, Santorum&#8217;s right on the money … Where does one begin? How about simply, courtesy of Dan Lips, a policy adviser with the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, in a 2005 commentary for National Review Online: &#8220;Without reform, a 30-year-old worker today should expect a 27-percent benefit cut at their retirement party in 2042. This is despite the fact that one out of every eight dollars he or she earns over a half-century in the work force will be paid into Social Security.&#8221; … Phased-in Social Security privatization &#8211; personal accounts earning market rates of return &#8211; is the only answer. Senior citizens aren&#8217;t affected. And because returns from privatized accounts on their worst modern-era day outstrip Social Security&#8217;s negligible returns, a very modest tax on those increased earnings, set aside in a true trust fund &#8211; not a drawer full of IOUs on which the current system rests &#8211; can serve the least fortunate among us. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ah yes, McNickle is a member of the Cato free lunches for everyone crowd as he claims one a better return on one’s investment without realizing that this higher expected return is simply the compensation for bearing more risk.  And I guess he does not realize that the Bush privatization plan will reduce the 30-year-old worker’s benefit by even more than 27%.  But I agree with McNickle that economics is not Senator Santorum’s strong suit as I have to wonder about the degree in economics that McNickle received from National Review University. </p>
<p>But since McNickle brought up <a href="http://www.americansunitedforchange.org/press/releases/au_calls_on_santorum_to_rebuke_president_for_proposing_again_to_privatize_s">Americans United</a>, let me thank them for the email as I pass along their question to the Senator contained in the email’s press release:<br />
<blockquote>In response to the frothing of the mouth diatribe today from Colin McNickle, editorial page director for the Pittsburg Tribune-Review, Americans United, the group which derailed President Bush’s effort to privatize Social Security in 2005, asked Senator Rick Santorum (R-PA) if he agrees with one of Pennsylvania’s largest newspapers and one of his most ardent supporters that Social Security is “a quite onerous Big Government bait-and-switch racket that would make Charles K. Ponzi, father of the Ponzi scheme, most proud.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>NPR had a piece this morning warning of a shortage of agricultural workers in California. It reported that some crops may rot in the field, if farmers there can&#8217;t get more workers by the end of the summer. Those of us who believe in markets would suggest that the farmers try raising wages. It is possible that some of the crops being farmed now in California would not be profitable, if farmers had to pay the wage necessary to attract workers in the current market (or if they had to pay the market price for water). In a market economy, that means that the farmers made bad choices on crop choices. That&#8217;s unfortunate for the farmers, but that&#8217;s how markets work.</p></blockquote>
<p>First of all – my apologies for my opening snark as I’m a loyal NPR listener.  But Dean is right – the market solution to a labor shortage is higher wages.  But consider this discussion in light of the move on behalf of some to toss immigrants out of the country.  If their efforts succeed, we’d have fewer agricultural workers in California, which would mean an even larger wage increase.</p>

                                <p>On the <a href="http://www.niemanwatchdog.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=background.view&#038;backgroundid=00103">Neiman Watchdog</a> we see Lieutenant General William E. Odom, U.S. Army (Ret.) writing this:<br />
<blockquote>Cheney has it exactly backwards. Our continued entanglement is what is destabilizing the region. The escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah and Hamas could become a new Arab-Israeli War. And it is precisely our actions in Iraq that have opened the door for Iran and Syria to support Hezbollah and Hamas actions without much to fear from the U.S. Cheney’s assertion is a new version of the old domino theory which was invented to justify the U.S. military involvement in Vietnam &#8230; the larger U.S. aim, the containment of China, was achieved, in spite of the United States, by Soviet and North Vietnamese actions against China. And the dire consequences of the domino theory that were so widely proclaimed by hawks at the time never came to pass. We should have learned a number of things from the Vietnam War, but most of all that unintended consequences are often the most significant outcomes.  Our well-intended policies in Vietnam soon rendered the United States incapable of accomplishing anything positive in the region &#8230; Is the domino theory valid for the Middle East? No, not any more than it was in Vietnam. But a reverse domino theory is. The longer the U.S. stays in Iraq, the more likely the collapse of the secular regimes in those Muslim nations, and the more likely a full-scale war between Israel and its neighbors. It’s American departure from Iraq that could prevent it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/16/rice-grotesque/">Amanda</a> was watching Condi Rice on ABC’s This Week so we didn’t have to:<br />
<blockquote>STEPHANOPOULOS: But before the war in Iraq many argued that going into Iraq would stir up a hornet’s nest. The administration strongly disagreed and here’s what Vice President Cheney had to say in August 2002. <br />CHENEY (VIDEO): I believe the opposite is true. Regime change in Iraq would bring about a number of benefits to the region, extremists in the region would have to rethink their strategy of jihad, moderates throughout the region would take heart, and our ability to advance the Israeli/Palestinian peace process would be enhanced. <br />STEPHANOPOULOS: Extremists now appear to have been emboldened. The moderates appear to be in retreat. There is no peace process. There is war. How do you answer administration critics who say that the administration’s actions have unleashed, have helped unleash the very hostilities you hoped to contain? <br />RICE: Well, first of all, those hostilities were not very well contained as we found out on September 11th, so the notion that policies that finally confront extremism are actually causing extremism, I find grotesque.</p></blockquote>
<p>It’s a pity that our Secretary of State happens to be Clueless Condi.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Another <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2006/07/17/neocons-middle-east-war">ThinkProgress</a> post begins with:<br />
<blockquote>In 1996, Richard Perle, Douglas Feith and David Wurmser (all later senior officials in the Bush administration) had a plan for how to destroy Hezbollah: Invade Iraq. They wrote a report to the newly elected Likud government in Israel calling for “a clean break” with the policies of negotiating with the Palestinians and trading land for peace &#8230; Now, with the U.S. bogged down in Iraq, with Bush losing control of world events, and with the threats to national security growing worse, no one could possibly still believe this plan, could they? Think again.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have seen Newt Gingrich, William Kristol, and the National Review’s chicken hawks all giddy about World War III over the past several days.  And if we go back to the 2000 Presidential campaign, recall Condi Rice was advising the government of Israel not to work with President Clinton  as he attempt to have Israel negotiate with the Palestinians in terms trading land for peace.  It is all making sense now – especially given that Karl Rove needs something to salvage the GOP majority in Congress in the upcoming 2006 elections.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/07/16/dont-blame-me">Christy</a> covered Robert Novak’s latest dissembling on Meet the Press.  Given the fact that Russert was running the interview, Novak felt free to lie whenever it served his purposes.  The last part of the interview was reported by Christy thusly:<br />
<blockquote>Novak says he doesn’t think he outed Valerie – thinks Aldrich Ames did so previously. [CHS:  There are so many things wrong with that statement, starting with the fact that Ames, if in fact that is even true which I doubt, would have outed her within an intel context, and Novak publicly printed the information which outed her…well, publicly.  Which is a whole other level of outing, now isn’t it?  Let alone the fact that, as I recall, there has been a lot of dispute about any claim that Ames outed Valerie previously.  The CYA Reputation Rehab Tour continues.]</p></blockquote>
<p>How many times have we heard this excuse before?  Cliff May wants you to believe that we all knew Wilson’s wife was a covert agent many years ago because hubbie told us so.  Then again – the National Review crowd and Mr. Novak also claims she was not a covert agent.  </p>
<p><a href="http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C13F73E5B0C728DDDA90994DB404482">Nicholas Kristoff</a> did write this:<br />
<blockquote>First, the C.I.A. suspected that Aldrich Ames had given Mrs. Wilson&#8217;s name (along with those of other spies) to the Russians before his espionage arrest in 1994. So her undercover security was undermined at that time, and she was brought back to Washington for safety reasons. Second, as Mrs. Wilson rose in the agency, she was already in transition away from undercover work to management, and to liaison roles with other intelligence agencies. So this year, even before she was outed, she was moving away from &#8220;noc&#8221; &#8211; which means non-official cover, like pretending to be a business executive. After passing as an energy analyst for Brewster-Jennings &#038; Associates, a C.I.A. front company, she was switching to a new cover as a State Department official, affording her diplomatic protection without having &#8220;C.I.A.&#8221; stamped on her forehead.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two problems with this story.  As <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2003_10/002395.php">Kevin Drum</a> noted on October 11, 2003:<br />
<blockquote>One more thing, though: Kristof really ought to tell us in general terms who his source for this column is. Someone in the CIA? Someone in the White House trying to downplay the damage? Plame&#8217;s next door neighbor? Since this story has been all about spin and counterspin from the very beginning, knowing where the spin is coming from is a crucial part of any story.</p></blockquote>
<p>Secondly, the name <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brewster_Jennings_&#038;_Associates">Brewster-Jennings &#038; Associates</a> was first registered in 1994 and had served as the front name for several CIA operatives for the next nine years when Novak outed this company as a front to cover his rear end in the aftermath of his July 14, 2003 outing of the fact that Valerie Plame was a CIA agent. </p>
<p>If Aldrich had already given up Brewster-Jennings, why would the CIA continue to use it as the cover for its agents?</p>

<blockquote>WASHINGTON (AP) &#8211; Roads and bridges built by U.S. taxpayers are starting to be sold off, and so far foreign-owned companies are doing the buying &#8230; Some experts welcome the trend. Robert Poole, transportation director for the conservative think tank Reason Foundation, said private investors can raise more money than politicians to build new roads because these kind of owners are willing to raise tolls. &#8220;They depoliticize the tolling decision,&#8221; Poole said &#8230; John Foote, senior fellow at Harvard&#8217;s Kennedy School of Government, said the government can take over a highway in an emergency. But he objects to selling roads to raise cash.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.reason.org/poole.shtml">Robert Poole</a> has been pushing this idea ever since his <a href="http://www.reason.org/ps111.pdf">1988 paper</a>, which yielded support for= California&#8217;s landmark private tollway law (AB 680), which authorized four pilot toll projects including the successful 91 Express Lanes in Orange County.  His paper does a nice job of summarizing William Vickrey’s <a href="http://www.vtpi.org/vickrey.htm">Principles of Efficient Congestion Pricing</a>.</p>
<p>Poole also advocates that the toll roads be privately owned rather than publicly owned for specious reasons as far as I can tell – and certainly a different view from that of <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002282.html">Max Sawicky</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Gov could just as easily contract out operations and management, but keep the tolls for itself. The fact that the money is earmarked to new projects &#8211; investment &#8211; is irrelevant. It&#8217;s still borrowing. You could just as easily keep the roads and float a bond &#8211; also borrowing &#8211; for the new projects. The leasing is not necessary. The political onus against explicit borrowing can warp decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is Max and Poole assuming the toll rates will be set optimally in terms of a Vickrey model?  We will return to the question of whether actual toll rates are set optimally, but note <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2006/06/privatizing_the.html">Richard Posner</a> countered:<br />
<blockquote>Against all this it will be argued &#8211; it is an argument emphasized by opponents of leasing the Indiana Toll Road &#8211; that privatization, at least when it takes the form of a sale or long-term lease of government property for a lump sum, beggars the future by depriving government of an income-producing asset. The argument, at least in its simplest form, is unsound, because the state is not disposing of an asset but merely changing its form: from a highway to cash.</p></blockquote>
<p>Posner is assuming that the government received as much in terms of the purchase price as it would have received in terms of the present value of future tolls.  As you may recall, I have <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/06/indiana-toll-road-efficiency-gains.html">my doubts</a>. Posner and <a href="http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/archives/2006/06/on_privatizing_1.html">Gary Becker</a> discussed efficiency issues that went well beyond the claim that the private sector runs things more cheaply, which brings me to the testimony of John H. Foote (Senior Fellow, Mossavar-Rahmani Center for Business and Government, Kennedy School of Government before the <a href="http://www.house.gov/transportation/highway/06-05-24/Foote.pdf">Highways, Transit and Pipelines Subcommittee of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee </a>:<br />
<blockquote>It is also supposed that the people who use the Skyway are winners because the private owner will provide better service than the City, such as the introduction of electronic toll collection. While it is true that the long-awaited electronic tolling was implemented by the private owner, this service enhancement could have been implemented by the City as has been the case with dozens of publicly-owned toll roads in the United States. There are many examples of public toll roads being operated efficiently and with an eye to service. Better service is not a good reason, in most cases, to privatize our highways. While there are winners, there are also losers. In the case of the Skyway, the losers are the Skyway users who will be paying significantly higher tolls than they would have paid under City ownership. The other loser is the region. First, the Skyway users: Under private ownership and with the agreement of the City, tolls on the Skyway will more than double in the next twelve years and continue to increase through the term of the concession. The increased revenues resulting from these toll increases will be used by the private owner to service the debt and equity that financed the $1.8 billion purchase price. In effect, the future tolls collected on the Skyway have been monetized to fund the operating budget of the City of Chicago. Further, the toll proposition is based on the users’ willingness to pay a toll in return for receiving a service. In this case, users will see ever increasing tolls and ever increasing revenues being banked by the private investor, with, at best, only modest improvements in service. Interestingly, the City has required the private investor to file annual financial reports for Skyway—we can only conjecture about public’s reaction in ten years when the sale proceeds have been spent but the earnings of the private investor continue to increase in step with higher tolls. The other loser is the region. First, not one dollar of the sale proceeds realized by the Chicago was earmarked for investment in transportation projects, despite the fact that Chicago is one the country’s most congested urban areas. The City also has abdicated the control of a major transportation artery and along with it the ability to manage the regional transportation network in a coordinated fashion. To see how this might adversely impact the public interest, it is important to recognize that the private investor’s sole motive is profit maximization. That is not a bad thing, but it does color how the toll road will be managed. Let me cite two illustrations of this point: Under the concession agreement, the private owner has the ability to use time of day pricing to discourage trucks from using the Skyway during day time hours. One possible consequence of this is to force trucks onto neighboring roads, generating externalities—traffic, congestion and pollution—for which the private owner is not accountable and does not have to concern itself. Second, the alternative routes for drivers who do not want to use the Skyway are non-tolled limited access roads that are operating currently at or near capacity, thus allowing Skyway to operate, in effect, as a monopoly. Even if it was believed that lower tolls on the Skyway would lessen congestion on the alternative routes, the private investor, again, is motivated only by maximizing revenues on its road. And what happens if the decision is made in the next several years to toll these alternative free roads in order to manage congestion? To do this effectively requires a coherent and coordinated regional toll policy. With Skyway out of the public’s control, this is no longer possible. Further the imposition of tolls on these free roads will likely increase the revenues to be realized by the private owner with no subsidiary benefit to the region. </p></blockquote>
<p>Foote was more complimentary to the Indiana toll road proposal and he finished with:</p>
<blockquote><p>The last point I want to make is that it is important for all of us to understand why investors are willing to pay large sums for these concessions. The reason is simply that these investors have been granted a franchise to increase tolls &#8211; an action that state and local governments are reluctant to take. The last toll increase on the Skyway was in 1993 and on the Indiana Tollroad in 1986. In both cases, the new owners, pursuant to agreements with the City and the State, will increase tolls immediately upon signing the concession agreements and every year thereafter for the term of the concessions. These increases are not be subject to voter approval, and are the consequence of what has been tagged, the outsourcing of political will.</p></blockquote>
<p>Outsourcing of political will reminds me of the Brad DeLong line about feckless politicians.  The only real advantage to selling our roads to foreign firms seems to be that our politicians do not have the courage to raise toll rates to the Vickrey optimal price.  Heck – Congress wants to lower fuel taxes even as we are concerned we consume too much oil.  But if we turn over pricing to a monopolist, we will likely see toll charges in excess of the Vickrey optimal price – unless governments put restrictions on these toll rates.  Of course, if the toll rates are regulated, private firms will offer less for these rights.</p>

<blockquote>And President Clinton, who snuck through a big tax-rate increase in 1992, experienced the retribution of voters in the 1994 midterm elections when Democrats lost control of both the House and Senate.</p></blockquote>
<p>This would have been a neat trick as George H. W. Bush was President in 1992.  President Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 on August 10, 1993 (must distinguish this from 2003).  This bill and some alternatives proposals were openly debated in both the House and the Senate.  To suggest it was “snuck through” is dishonest.  But what would you expect from someone who doesn’t even realize that Bill Clinton did not become President until January 20, 1993?</p>

<blockquote>By having the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court conduct the review instead of a regular federal court, the Bush administration would ensure the secrecy of details of the highly classified program. The administration has argued that making details of the program public would compromise national security. However, such details could include politically explosive disclosures that the government has kept tabs on people it shouldn&#8217;t have been monitoring.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/009042.php">Josh Marshall</a> was alerted to this passage by a TPM reader and notes:<br />
<blockquote>It sounds like Landay&#8217;s pointing to the possibility that the White House has been using the program to monitor political opponents. (I&#8217;m not sure how else to interpret that line.) And you get the sense he&#8217;s doing more than speculating.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m guilty of the same speculation but why would the White House be so afraid of a FISA Court review?  Of course, some rightwingers would view spying on Democrats as being equivalent to spying on terrorists.</p>

                                <p>Had John Kerry become President and invited Alice Rivlin to be part of his economic team, I suspect her advice to President Kerry would be similar to the advice she offered President Clinton.  <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=harrop13&#038;date=20060713">Froma Harrop </a> reminds us of how Hubert Humphrey defined being a liberal back in 1949:<br />
<blockquote>Back in 1949, the great Minnesota liberal Hubert Humphrey was pointedly asked on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; whether progressives like himself cared about holding down the costs of government. Humphrey answered yes, but &#8220;economy in government to me doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean spending little. It means spending what you have and spending it well &#8230; &#8220;</p></blockquote>
<p>Harrop’s discussion then turns to the current Administration that pretends to be giving us tax cuts as it piles massive amounts of deferred tax liabilities upon us:<br />
<blockquote>As for White House comparisons, there&#8217;s no contest. The current Republican administration leaves its Democratic predecessor in the dust for both amounts spent and money wasted. Bush is the biggest spender since Lyndon Johnson, according to the Cato Institute. In domestic discretionary spending (which doesn&#8217;t include defense or entitlements), Bush has Johnson beat. By contrast, Bill Clinton stands as a paragon of restraint. Domestic discretionary spending jumped an average 8 percent a year in Bush&#8217;s first term, versus only 2.5 percent annually in Clinton&#8217;s eight years. Many conservatives are amazed that Democrats haven&#8217;t made more hay of their superior record in containing the size of government. The Democrats&#8217; dilemma is that they are not philosophically opposed to expanded government, even if in practice they have shown far more spending discipline. Democrats really ought to brag about their Clintonian track record. Not only did they keep government growth in check, but they paid its bills the old-fashioned way, with tax revenues. That&#8217;s what fiscal rectitude is all about. And it shines next to the Bush administration&#8217;s disgraceful habit of borrowing on the backs of future generations. Even more important, Democrats have spent the taxpayers&#8217; money with greater care. The reason, in part, is that Democrats don&#8217;t maintain a childlike faith in the good intentions and can-do of the private sector. They believe in regulating these guys — and that government can do some things better than can business. The Bush administration likes to send big checks and a have-a-nice-day to private contractors, who then do as they please. Our MBA president seems to forget that he is supposed to represent the taxpayers in these transactions, not the business interests. </p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Even though <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/posts/2006/07/13/novak-attacks-murray-waas-on-hannity-colmes">Dr. Novak</a> has been a busy person countering all those who would dare spread vicious lies about his role in PlameGate, he has taken the time to explain the <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/evansnovak.php?id=16011#2">economic principles</a> behind Bush’s fiscal fiasco for us:</p>
<blockquote><p>The White House Office of Management and Budget had originally forecast a deficit of $423 billion for fiscal 2006 &#8211; instead, increased tax revenues have pushed the estimate down to about $296 billion. </p>
<p>1. Accusations that the administration is employing the famous UPOD business principle &#8211; &#8220;under-promise, over-deliver&#8221; &#8211; are not entirely unjustified, considering that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office had originally forecast a deficit of just $350 billion. Still, both were wrong by a very large margin (15.4 percent for the CBO and 30 percent for the White House), and the positive reversal of fortune clearly had nothing to do with fiscal discipline in the Congress. </p>
<p>2. The real culprit here for the errors is the practice of static scoring of tax revenues, which is still employed by the government despite experience. Both the White House and the CBO score the loss of tax revenue from tax-cuts as though they did not affect the behavior of business owners, shareholders and other investors &#8211; a sure recipe for missing the mark. </p>
<p>3. Setting aside the obvious fact that most of the Bush deficits are 9/11-related, the principles of supply-side economics are vindicated both by the success of the 2003 tax cuts in maintaining and even raising tax revenues, and the failure of the 2001 across-the board income tax cuts to do the same. Large cuts in the top marginal tax rates have the greatest effect on economic growth, and the growth is augmented when cuts are closest to the investment side of the economy.</p>
<p>4. The lesson is that tax cuts that focus on investment &#8211; such as the 2003 dividend and capital-gains tax cuts &#8211; really do affect investor behavior. More money pours into capital markets when investors realize a greater after-tax return. Corporations are, therefore, freer to expand business and profits. Moreover, investors are less hesitant to realize smaller gains when those gains are taxed at a lower rate &#8211; the top rate now being 15 percent. This results in a greater number of transactions, meaning more tax revenue that would not have been collected under a high-tax regime. This explains why the tax-rate cuts&#8217; overall effect on tax revenues, depending on who is doing the measuring, has been negligible or even positive.</p>
<p>5. CBO&#8217;s estimate for the fiscal 2007 deficit is $337 billion. In January 2004, President Bush made the rather weak promise of halving the budget deficit by 2009. It is not exactly clear when that promise can be considered fulfilled &#8211; the fiscal 2004 budget deficit ended up being $413 billion, but the projection had been $477 billion. Either way, he is already within striking distance. The problem in the long- and even medium-run is that as entitlements become more expensive with an aging population, a balanced budget becomes less possible. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now – I feel MUCH better!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As <a href="http://levin.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODk1ODc1MTY2NTdmNjljMDExNTliYWYwNjBkMTg0Mjg">Mark Levin</a> opines on the civil suit filed by Joe Wilson and his wife, he seems to not know something here:<br />
<blockquote>To the extent possible, through depositions and document production, Cheney and Lewis&#8217;s lawyers should get to the bottom of the real scandal, e.g., who exactly is Valerie Plame, what was her role in sending her husband to Niger, who were all of her contacts, what media sources did she speak to, what politicians did she speak to, and on and on.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s help Mark out.  Plame did not talk to media sources or politicians and her sources are (or should I say were) national security secrets.  But if Mr. Levin does not know what she is by now, maybe Dr. Novak can explain that one to him since he let the rest of the world know back on July 14, 2003.</p>
