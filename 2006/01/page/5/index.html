                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/007437.php">Joshua Marshall</a> has been doing an excellent job of covering the troubles that certain House Republicans have been having with their ethical challenges as well as the race to replace Tom DeLay as Majority leader:<br />
<blockquote>The Economic Policy Know-Nothings at the Club for Growth endorse John Shadegg for Majority Leader </p></blockquote>
<p>So let’s turn to the <a href="http://www.clubforgrowth.org/blog/archives/028169.php">Club for Growth</a> endorsement:<br />
<blockquote>“There is no member of the House of Representatives more committed to the idea of limited government and economic freedom than John Shadegg,” said Club for Growth president Pat Toomey. “To be an effective governing party, Republicans must focus once again on these core issues and John Shadegg has the unique qualifications to lead the way.” Rep. Shadegg is one of only four Members of the House of Representatives to vote the pro-growth position on every key vote identified last year by the Club for Growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Shadegg has never met a tax cut he did not like – even if the extra consumption from tax cuts lower national savings and long-term growth.  But the Club for Growth – like <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/did-someone-say-spending-restraint.html">Lawrence Kudlow</a> want to pretend that Shadegg can shave hundreds of billions of dollars a year from Federal spending.  Given that the new prescription drug benefit will add a sizeable amount to Federal spending in the future, let’s see how Shadegg voted via <a href="http://www.tnr.com/blog/theplank?pid=5801">Michael Crowley</a> who first cites this June 2005 passage from Congress Daily:<br />
<blockquote>During the marathon vote for the Medicare prescription drug bill in November 2003, House GOP leaders found a surprising ally in Rep. John Shadegg, R-Ariz. Shadegg opposed the bill, but helped the party reach its razor-thin margin of victory in the early morning hours.</p></blockquote>
<p>He voted for this massive increase in Federal spending even though he made the following statement a few months before the vote:<br />
<blockquote>Sadly, Congress is putting politics ahead of policy. In its rush to pass something – anything &#8211; it is on the verge of imposing a staggering financial burden on our children and grandchildren, pushing Medicare closer to financial collapse and losing a once in a lifetime opportunity for reform.</p></blockquote>
<p>It would seem that Shadegg also puts politics ahead of policy and has no clue how to reduce the massive Federal deficits either.  Of course, more private consumption from those tax cuts and more government spending equates to less national savings.  And yet – the Club for Growth calls Shadegg pro-growth?  Josh is right – they are Economic Policy Know-Nothings.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/did-someone-say-spending-restraint.html">PGL</a> notes that the right-wing talking-point regarding the federal budget deficit &#8211; that the deficit is purely the result of out-of-control government spending, and that the deficit can be fixed by curtailing spending &#8211; is still being (ahem) liberally used.  (Of course, some Bush-backers would argue that deficits don&#8217;t matter in the first place, but that&#8217;s another issue.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s true the federal spending has grown fairly rapidly over the past few years.  But some types of spending have grown faster than others, and in historical context, recent spending increases are not particularly dramatic, as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/spending-growth-in-context.html">I wrote about last month</a>. </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s take an even more detailed look at exactly where spending has grown.  The following chart shows the increase in annual spending by category between 2001 and 2005, as tabulated by the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6146&#038;sequence=0">CBO</a>. </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/spending_growth1.jpg"></p>
<p>So, if you want to assign the blame for federal spending growth, then apportion the blame as follows:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/spending_growth3.jpg"></p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, if you hope to fix the budget deficit by undoing the spending increases of the past 5 years, then you should focus your attention on Defense and Homeland Security spending and spending on federal health programs.  Of the $450+ billion increase in annual federal spending since 2001 (excluding the separately funded Social Security program), non-security-related discretionary spending (including all of the government pork that so excite right-wing commentators) only accounts for $64 billion of the increase, or about fourteen percent.</p>

<blockquote>This is so because the debate about the efficiency of markets versus central planning has been settled, and free markets are now a fact. The happy result is that China, India, and other formerly socialist nations will continue to grow</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems that some folks at the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/is-china-economic-threat-to-us.html">American Enterprise Institute</a> aren’t aware of the fact that the Chinese government is adopting market based economics.  </p>
<p>Then again – Mr. Tamny has yet to figure out that the Federal Reserve is concerned about other stabilization matters and not just the inflation rate.</p>

                                <p>Just days after <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/snows-garbage-on-deficit.html">Kash</a> reviewed the latest garbage from Treasury Secretary Snow, we see <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/12/AR2006011201821_pf.html">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Driven by the cost of hurricane relief, the federal budget deficit is expected to balloon back above $400 billion for the fiscal year that ends in September, reversing the improvements of 2005, a White House official told reporters yesterday.  But some budget analysts cautioned that the estimate should be considered more of a political mark to inform the coming budget debate than an economic forecast. This is the third straight year in which the White House has summoned reporters well ahead of the official budget release to project a higher-than-anticipated deficit.  In the past two years, when final deficit figures have come in at record or near-record levels, White House officials have boasted that they had made progress, since the final numbers were below estimates.&#8221;This administration has a history of overestimating the deficit early in the year, lowering expectations, then taking credit when it comes in below forecast,&#8221; said Stanley E. Collender, a federal budget expert at Financial Dynamics Business Communications. &#8220;It&#8217;s not just a history. It&#8217;s almost an obsession.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So is the White House saying spending is both up and down at the same time?  Rather than focus on the fact that they tend to talk out of both sides of their mouths, let’s check the record:<br />
<blockquote>After four years of budget surpluses, the government fell back into a deficit in fiscal 2002, after which the deficit climbed to $378 billion in 2003 and $412 billion in 2004. In 2005, the tide of red ink receded to $319 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>My only complaint with this article from Jonathan Weisman is that he did not include the General Fund deficit numbers, but we get the idea anyway.  This Administration is clearly running large deficits with no clue what to do about it – except more spin such as this:<br />
<blockquote>Still, Joel David Kaplan, the deputy director of the White House budget office, lamented the rising tide of red ink, ascribing it to necessary spending in the hurricane-ravaged Gulf Coast. &#8220;We have made substantial investments in the region and the new deficit projections will include costs of Katrina and Rita recovery,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We believe that those increased outlays associated with Katrina recovery efforts are a temporary event.&#8221;Kaplan joined top Bush administration officials who in recent days have warned that the president&#8217;s budget for fiscal 2007, due out next month, will call for significant belt-tightening.</p></blockquote>
<p>Weisman follows this spin with the following reality:<br />
<blockquote>A projected deficit back above $400 billion is in line with private-sector forecasts, which ascribe the reversal not only to hurricane spending, but to an emergency war-funding request due out soon that could approach $100 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kash’s point was simple – small spending reductions will not eliminate this enormous budget deficit.  Of course, this White House has yet to even figure out how not to increase spending.  So the only question regarding taxes is not whether they will go up but when.   Well – maybe one other question – whose taxes will be increased in the future.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200601131453.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> has almost solved the Federal deficit problem without tax increases:<br />
<blockquote>Last year, about $27 billion in earmarks made it into appropriations bills, while another roughly $25 billion in earmarks was attached to the highway transportation bill alone. But pork can be found everywhere.  There are a couple hundred billion dollars in farm and corporate-welfare subsidies that can easily be scrapped.</p></blockquote>
<p>So let me get out my calculator.  Assuming Larry has the numbers right – there is $250 billion a year in pork that can be eliminated from Federal spending.  But as I peruse the Federal budget statistics, I can’t find Larry’s numbers.  What am I missing?  </p>
<p>Finally, Larry has something from Michael Darda that Kash might be interested in:<br />
<blockquote>But Wall Street economist Michael Darda reports that federal spending increased 8.1 percent during the last twelve months. Since 2001, the budget has expanded 6.6 percent per year compared with only 3.1 percent growth during the 1993-2000 Clinton years. Though supply-side revenues reduced last year’s budget deficit by about $100 billion &#8211; moving it down toward $300 billion, or roughly 2.5 percent of GDP &#8211; a return to a $400 billion deficit in 2006 as suggested by the White House will be political poison for tax-cut extensions. </p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the National Review pundits think the Laffer curve is working and that the deficit is attributable to some explosion in Federal spending.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>This morning the BLS released its estimate of <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ppi.nr0.htm">producer price inflation</a> for December:<br />
<blockquote>The Producer Price Index for Finished Goods rose 0.9 percent in December, seasonally adjusted, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  This increase followed a 0.7-percent decline in November and a 0.7-percent gain in October.  Prices for finished goods other than foods and energy advanced 0.1 percent in December, the same rate as in November.</p>
<p>&#8230;From December 2004 to December 2005, finished goods prices rose 5.4 percent, following a 4.2-percent increase in 2004.  The index for finished energy goods climbed 23.9 percent in 2005, after moving up 13.4 percent in the preceding calendar year.  Conversely, prices for finished goods other than foods and energy rose 1.7 percent in 2005, following a 2.3-percent gain in 2004.</p></blockquote>
<p>It continues to be the case that dramatically higher energy costs are not feeding through into higher costs of other goods and services.  The following chart illustrates that there have now been three full years of rapid increases in energy prices that have not fed through into higher non-energy producer prices.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/ppi_energy2.jpg"></p>
<p>Unlike during earlier energy shocks, when increases in the price of oil typically led to inflation in other types of goods and services, this time the increase in the price of oil has led only to a change in the relative price between energy and non-energy products.  </p>
<p>Why haven&#8217;t firms passed on their higher energy costs?  Presumably it&#8217;s because they haven&#8217;t been <em>able</em> to charge higher prices, not because they haven&#8217;t wanted to.  This could be the case if the demand for non-energy products by firms has fallen a bit as firms have had to spend more of their budgets on energy products.  In other words, firms are simply shifting the allocation of their spending away from non-energy products and toward energy products.</p>
<p>One interpretation of this phenomenon is that it is a symptom of weak aggregate demand.  If aggregate demand were higher, then firms would be in a better position to pass on their higher energy costs.  The fact that the discrepancy between energy costs and non-energy costs has persisted and even widened in recent months may therefore be a sign of a slowing economy.</p>

                                <p>Nouriel Roubini draws our attention to a <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/speeches/2006/gei060111.html">speech given by Tim Geithner</a> (head of the NY Fed) yesterday.  <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/113998">Roubini argues</a> that this speech contained an assessment of the degree to which asset prices should be a factor in the conduct of monetary policy that was subtly but significantly different from the views offered by Greenspan and Bernanke over the past few years.  In particular, Roubini argues, Geithner distinctly sends the message (though not in so many words &#8211; in many, many more, in fact) that rapid rises in asset prices may indeed be cause for concern by the central bank, and may require policy action.</p>
<p>Geithner&#8217;s concluding lines nicely summarize the most important points that he made in this speech:<br />
<blockquote>Asset prices probably matter more than they once did, but what that means for monetary policy necessarily depends on the circumstances. </p>
<p>Perhaps it makes sense to conclude with the more general observation that changes in the size of balance sheets increase the importance of sustaining the credibility of monetary policy, because they increase the costs of a loss of credibility or a negative shock to credibility. We live with considerable uncertainty about the sustainability of the pattern of relatively low risk premia and reduction in the cost of insurance against future macroeconomic and financial volatility.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with Roubini that these two observations &#8211; that we currently have a pattern of unusually low risk premia in asset prices (read: certain asset prices are inexplicably high given the underlying fundamentals), and that the central bank will need to take this into account to an increasing degree than it has historically &#8211; are noteworthy from a member of the Fed&#8217;s leadership.  </p>
<p>However, as Geithner points out, we still have a lot of work to do to get a better understanding of the role that asset prices play in the broader economy.  So it remains a very open question exactly how these thoughts will translate into monetary policy over the coming years.</p>

<blockquote>WASHINGTON &#8211; Supreme Court nominees are so mum about the major legal issues at their Senate confirmation hearings that the hearings serve little purpose and should probably be abandoned, Democratic Sen. Joe Biden said Thursday. </p>
<p>&#8220;The system&#8217;s kind of broken,&#8221; said Biden, a member of the Judiciary Committee considering the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito.  &#8220;Nominees now, Democrat and Republican nominees, come before the United States Congress and resolve not to let the people know what they think about the important issues,&#8221; such as a president&#8217;s authority to go to war, said Biden.</p>
<p>As the committee headed into its fourth day of hearings on the Alito nomination, Biden told NBC&#8217;s &#8220;Today&#8221; show that a better solution might be to skip hearings and send nominations straight to the Senate floor for a vote. &#8220;Just go to the Senate floor and debate the nominee&#8217;s statements,&#8221; the Delaware senator said, &#8220;instead of this game.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe he has a point.  Can anyone point to anything of substance that was learned during either the Roberts or Alito hearings?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/12/news/economy/pluggedin_fortune/index.htm">Justin Fox</a> thinks “corporate pensions are an unstable, unfair and economically perverse means of paying for retirement”:</p>
<blockquote><p>This phenomenon, along with the more dramatic cases of companies going bankrupt and defaulting on existing pension commitments (think United Airlines), has gotten tons of press, most of it of the &#8220;ain&#8217;t it a shame&#8221; variety. But the real shame may be that we ever put so much faith in such an inherently unstable, unfair and economically perverse means of providing for retirement.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have a mixed reaction to his op-ed.  Some of what he writes makes sense, but much of it strikes me as simply incorrect:</p>
<blockquote><p>But there were problems with Wilson&#8217;s approach that, while they didn&#8217;t seem like a big deal in 1950, were to loom large decades later. For one thing, the Wilson way assumed that lifetime jobs with big, pension-granting corporations were the American norm &#8211; which ceased to be the case decades ago. For another, it failed to foresee that pension commitments could become a heavy burden for companies (among them Wilson&#8217;s own General Motors) forced by competition and changing consumer demand to get smaller or at least leaner. If GM had simply set aside all the money it put into its pension plan over the decades in individual retirement accounts for its employees, it wouldn&#8217;t have this problem.</p></blockquote>
<p><em>Who</em> would not have <em>what</em> problem?  This last sentence implies that the manager of the GM pension proposal received a poor portfolio return.  In GM’s case, isn’t it more likely that management invested less of GM’s funds into the pension plan than what the workers had given up in terms of reduced wages when they struck their deferred compensation deal in the 1980’s?  If this were the case, it was not a poor portfolio performance but a diversion of worker’s wealth towards shareholder’s wealth.</p>
<p>Some GM retirees would be worse off than they are under the existing pension plan, but prospects for current employees (and potential future employees) would be far better. That&#8217;s the problem with pension plans that promise a specific benefit in the future &#8211; they amount, pension consultant Keith Ambachtsheer says, to a contract between current and future generations, and those future generations aren&#8217;t represented at the bargaining table. As a result, they get stuck guaranteeing the retirement income of their elders while receiving nothing in return.</p>
<p>OK, there may be indeed an intergenerational concern where younger GM workers are losing out.  But in one way, they are losing out to current shareholders who in turn may have been mislead by accounting gimmicks that allowed former shareholders to make out with equity that should have been put back into the pension plan.</p>
<p>Fox links to material put forth by the <a href="http://www.rotman.utoronto.ca/icpm/publications.htm">University of Toronto&#8217;s Rotman School of Management</a>, which are interesting.  But let me get to where Fox and I agree.  Fox rejects the rightwing canard that goes like this: if corporate pension plans are going bankrupt, then a publicly funded defined benefits plan is also a bad idea.  No, the fact that workers do not stay in one job for their entire career heightens the need for a publicly funded defined benefits plan.  Fox concludes with:</p>
<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s sort of what President Bush was proposing last year with his Social Security private accounts &#8211; but those accounts were relatively puny, the president was unwilling to come clean about the true costs of his plan, and Congress in its wisdom (and fear of the AARP) chose to do nothing.  A long-cracked pillar of the American retirement system is crumbling, and not nearly enough is being done to build a replacement.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Indeed!</strong></p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>There were two news releases this morning related to international trade.  First, the BEA reported on the <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/newsrel/tradnewsrelease.htm">November trade deficit</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis, through the Department of Commerce, announced today that total November exports of $109.3 billion and imports of $173.5 billion resulted in a goods and services deficit of $64.2 billion, $3.9 billion less than the $68.1 billion in October, revised. November exports were $1.9 billion more than October exports of $107.4 billion. November imports were $2.0 billion less than October imports of $175.5 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because of the volatility of the price of oil over the past year, it&#8217;s informative to take a look at imports excluding petroleum products, as well.  Over the first 11 months of 2005 the US imported $1,592bn of non-oil goods and services, compared to $1,446bn of non-oil goods and services over the same period in 2004, an increase of 10%.  Exports also grew by 10% in 2005 compared to 2004, but because the value of exports was much smaller than the value of imports to begin with, the trade deficit has also risen by about 10%.</p>
<p>The second news release is the BLS data for <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/news.release/ximpim.nr0.htm">December import and export prices</a>.  From the news release:<br />
<blockquote>The U.S. Import Price Index fell 0.2 percent in December, the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the U.S. Department of Labor reported today.  The decline followed a 1.8 percent decrease in November and was again led by lower petroleum prices.</p>
<p>&#8230;Overall import prices rose 7.9 percent for the year ended in December, which followed a 6.7 percent increase over the prior 12 months, and was the largest advance over any calendar year since 1987.  Despite declining the past three months, the price index for petroleum increased 42.5 percent for the year following a 30.3 percent advance in 2004.  Prices for nonpetroleum imports increased 2.4 percent for the December 2004-2005 period after rising 3.7 percent over the previous 12 months.</p></blockquote>
<p>For comparison, note that the price index on domestic production excluding food and energy rose at an annualized rate of about 2.7% over the first three quarters of 2005, according to NIPA data.  The fact that prices for non-oil imported goods and services rose a bit more slowly than prices on domestically produced items may be due to the fact that the trade-weighted dollar exchange rate was slightly stronger in 2005 than in 2004.  The stronger dollar in 2005 helped to keep import prices down a bit.</p>
