                                <p>It looks like Bush is going to spend a fair bit of his State of the Union address talking about <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/bush_state_of_union;_ylt=AiIAklKJ6lbW.70_ES6xNxes0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2Z2szazkxBHNlYwN0bQ--">rising health care costs</a>.  I’ve argued for a long time (yes, I realize that I’m not the only one) that health care is probably the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/real-crisis.html">biggest domestic problem</a> that the US will face over the medium and long term.  </p>
<p>Here at Angry Bear we&#8217;ve devoted a fair amount of time discussing the topic of health care (see the posts under &#8220;The US Health Care System&#8221; at left for some examples).  But those posts focus more on the performance of the US health care system than on how medical costs affect individual households.  So over the next week or two I&#8217;ll be putting up some data illustrating how health care costs and burdens on individuals have changed over the past couple of decades.</p>
<p>Today I&#8217;ll start with one simple measure of the rise in health care costs: the CPI measure of the price of medical care, from the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm">BLS</a>.  The following chart shows the annual inflation rate in medical care, compared to all other items that consumers buy.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/med_care_cpi.jpg"></p>
<p>Note that this indicator of health care inflation measures the prices of out-of-pocket medical expenses, including insurance premia that individuals pay.  (For details about the CPI data on medical care inflation, see <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/cpifact4.htm">this publication</a>.) In other words, it does not measure inflation in health insurance coverage provided by employers.  </p>
<p>Part of what I hope to do over the next week is explore some of the implications for households of the fact that health insurance is frequently provided by employers in the US.  Be prepared to be a bit depressed.</p>

First, let’s begin with a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=email_us&#038;refer=news_index&#038;sid=azvCEhXtl1g0">Bloomberg</a> discussion:<br />
<blockquote>Jan. 17 (Bloomberg) &#8211; American workers have rarely taken home a smaller share of the nation&#8217;s prosperity, a condition that is undermining bipartisan support for free trade and creating friction between President George W. Bush&#8217;s administration and the Federal Reserve. After 16 consecutive quarters of economic growth, pay is rising at a slower rate than in any similar expansion since the end of World War II. Companies are paying less of their cash gains in the form of wages and salaries than at any time since the Great Depression, according to government figures … &#8220;There is no doubt that something is happening&#8221; to reduce labor&#8217;s share of income, says Robert Solow, a Nobel Prize- winning economist and professor emeritus at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge. An economy that doesn&#8217;t distribute its gains widely is &#8220;poorly performing,&#8221; he says. From the final quarter of 2001 through last year&#8217;s third quarter, total compensation paid to employees by corporations, including health benefits, rose at a 4.3 percent average annual rate, according to government figures. That&#8217;s the slowest growth for any similar period in post-war expansions lasting at least four years.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_buzzcharts/buzzcharts200601131017.asp">Jerry Bowyer</a> might look at the same facts and conclude that this is good news for employment:<br />
<blockquote>Not all jobs are created equal. Some are volatile and speculative, and some are backed by real, existing profits. As it turns out, the jobs created over the last several years are backed by record levels of corporate profit. From 2001 to 2005, we’ve seen a 1.4 percent increase in payroll jobs. But over that same period of time, we’ve seen corporate profits jump from $767 billion to $1.3 trillion — an increase of more than 70 percent. This is in stark contrast to the job boom of the late 1990s, which greatly outpaced the growth of corporate profits. From 1997 to 2000, corporate profits actually decreased from $868 billion to $817 billion, a drop of almost 6 percent. Over that same time period, payroll jobs increased from 122 million to 131 million &#8211; a jump of 7.4 percent. Profits were dropping, but corporations kept hiring new workers anyway. It follows that since today’s jobs are backed by rapidly growing profits, they should be more stable than the ones created in the late 1990s.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did I say the same facts?  My mistake – as corporate profits represent a subset of the profits from American businesses.  So there could be several explanations of differences in the growth of corporate profits and payroll employment growth.  Our chart, however, looks at overall national income, which is roughly divided between labor income and capital income.  It does show that profits have been growing faster than national income, which is the flip side of the declining labor share.  <br />Bowyer wants us to believe that the share of income going to capital income must grow before we see sustained employment growth.  We should note, however, that the two periods where the capital share fell – the late 1990’s and the late 1970’s – also saw much higher employment growth than we have seen over the past five years.</p>
<p>Bowyer also offers us no microeconomic or macroeconomic reason to believe that rising profits are necessary for increasing employment growth.  Let’s toss a few counterexamples – two from the macroeconomics that Solow is referring to and one from microeconomics.  The first macroeconomic counterexample comes from the premise that weak aggregate demand tends to depress wages, which was discussed in the Bloomberg article.  The second macroeconomic counterexample comes from long-run economic growth considerations (as in Solow’s writings from the late 1950’s).  The fact that national savings and investment have been crowded-out by Bush’s fiscal irresponsibility, the capital-labor ratio would tend to fall, which means less real wage growth and a higher return to the capital stock.  The impact on the labor share depends on the elasticity of substitution.  If this elasticity of substitution is less than unity, a lower savings rate would suggest a falling labor share over the long-run.</p>
<p>The microeconomic counterexample comes from the comparison of labor demand under competition versus monopsony.  Competitive firms hire labor up to the point where the value of labor’s marginal product equals the competitive wage rate.  The accounting profits for these entities will cover only the opportunity cost of capital with no economic profit.  If these firms, however, can create a monopsony cartel, they could extract economic profits by curtailing employment.</p>

<blockquote>The Supreme Court delivered a rebuff to the Bush administration over physician-assisted suicide today, rejecting a Justice Department effort to bar doctors in Oregon from helping terminally ill patients end their lives under a 1994 state law. In a 6-3 vote, the court ruled that then-U.S. Attorney General John D. Ashcroft overstepped his authority in 2001 by trying to use a federal drug law to prosecute doctors who prescribed lethal overdoses under the Oregon Death With Dignity Act, the only law in the nation that allows physician-assisted suicide. The measure has been approved twice by Oregon voters and upheld by lower court rulings. Faced with lower court rulings against his position, Ashcroft brought the case to the Supreme Court on the day he announced his resignation in November 2004. The case was continued by his successor as attorney general, Alberto R. Gonzales. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., dissenting for the first time since he joined the court in September, sided with the two most conservative justices &#8211; Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas &#8211; in voting for the minority view. At issue was whether the federal Controlled Substances Act, enacted in 1970 to combat drug abuse and trafficking, allowed the attorney general unilaterally to prohibit doctors in Oregon from prescribing regulated drugs for use in physician-assisted suicide, despite state law permitting them to do so. Writing the opinion of the court, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy said the federal law bars doctors from using prescriptions to engage in illicit drug dealing but that &#8220;the statute manifests no intent to regulate the practice of medicine generally.&#8221; Moreover, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) relies on &#8220;a functioning medical profession regulated under the states&#8217; police powers,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;In the face of the CSA&#8217;s silence on the practice of medicine generally and its recognition of state regulation of the medical profession, it is difficult to defend the Attorney General&#8217;s declaration that the statute impliedly criminalizes physician-assisted suicide,&#8221; Kennedy wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the Alito hearings, the Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee – using the wiretapping controversy as background – pressed Judge Alito whether the President could ignore the intent of Congress after a law has been passed.  Alito hedged on this question.  In other words, Alito would not say whether a President could simply ignore a law.  </p>
<p>In this case, the President wanted to simply make up authority that Congress had not granted the Executive Branch.  It would seem Justices Roberts, Scalia, and Thomas are not bothered by the excessive reach of the Executive Branch.  If Alito has the same view, isn’t this another reason to not approve his nomination to the Supreme Court?</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/alito_/2006/01/judging_and_personal_beliefs.php">Mark Kleiman</a> has more criticism of the dissenting opinion written by Scalia.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/16/AR2006011601291.html">The Washington Post</a> ran an interesting story this morning about bankruptcy filings since the new bankruptcy rules came into effect in October of 2005.  Some highlights from the article:<br />
<blockquote>The law requires debtors to see credit counselors before they file for bankruptcy protection. It is a prerequisite that banks and credit card issuers hoped would steer consumers away from bankruptcy court and into plans that would allow them to repay debts over a few years.</p>
<p>But so far, that is not happening.</p>
<p>The counseling agencies say most debtors are in such deep financial trouble that they cannot qualify for a debt-management plan. &#8220;Typically, consumers are too far gone when they get to us,&#8221; said Ivan L. Hand Jr., president and chief executive of Money Management International Inc. (MMI), the nation&#8217;s largest credit-counseling organization.</p>
<p>&#8230;In the first 13 weeks after the new law took effect Oct. 17, only 4.5 percent of the 14,907 debtors counseled by MMI had sufficient income to be considered for a plan to pay back debts over a few years. Of those 669 debtors, only 42 have signed up so far for such a debt-management plan.</p>
<p>&#8230;During congressional debate, many critics of the old law suggested that bankruptcy protection was being used as a cover by spendthrifts who might be able to repay their debts with a little more discipline.</p>
<p>But credit counselors say that is not the type of debtor they have been seeing.</p></blockquote>
<p>First, an imporant caveat: given the 2005 changes in the bankruptcy laws and the rush of filings just before the new law took effect (over 600,000 in October 2005 alone), it is natural that we would expect fewer bankruptcy filings in recent months.  As a result, it is possible that recent filers for bankruptcy are in worse financial condition than the average filer before the changes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the data presented in the article is truly striking &#8211; though not particularly surprising.  The article essentially illustrates that the people filing for bankruptcy are truly in terrible financial straits.  Not exactly an earth-shattering revelation. </p>
<p>Yet it&#8217;s striking because the whole premise behind the change in bankruptcy rules was that many people abuse the bankruptcy system, and use bankruptcy protection to avoid repaying loans that they simply don&#8217;t want to repay, even thought they&#8217;re able to.  </p>
<p>This premise seemed faulty from the beginning; <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/whats-wrong-with-bankruptcy-reform.html">as I&#8217;ve written about before</a>, there were already checks in place to prevent abuse of the system, and the vast, vast majority of bankruptcy filings have always been by people in truly dire financial circumstances.  </p>
<p>As a result, the effect of the bankruptcy law is simply to reallocate the pain of bankruptcy further away from the corporations who (often through their own faulty judgement) loaned money to people who were unable to repay, and toward the individual.  As this article suggests, there is little reason to think that the bankruptcy reform will do much to reduce spurious bankruptcy filings &#8211; simply because almost all bankruptcy filings are for legitimate reasons in the first place.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s exactly why the 2005 bankruptcy reform act always seemed to me to be more about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/03/rent-seeking-behavior-pays-off.html">rewarding financial services companies</a> than about fixing a real policy problem.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The President&#8217;s men have minced words about America&#8217;s laws. The Attorney General openly conceded that the &#8220;kind of surveillance&#8221; we now know they have been conducting requires a court order unless authorized by statute. The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act self-evidently does not authorize what the NSA has been doing, and no one inside or outside the Administration claims that it does. Incredibly, the Administration claims instead that the surveillance was implicitly authorized when Congress voted to use force against those who attacked us on September 11th.</p>
<p>This argument just does not hold any water. Without getting into the legal intricacies, it faces a number of embarrassing facts. First, another admission by the Attorney General: he concedes that the Administration knew that the NSA project was prohibited by existing law and that they consulted with some members of Congress about changing the statute. Gonzalez says that they were told this probably would not be possible. So how can they now argue that the Authorization for the Use of Military Force somehow implicitly authorized it all along? Second, when the Authorization was being debated, the Administration did in fact seek to have language inserted in it that would have authorized them to use military force domestically &#8211; and the Congress did not agree. Senator Ted Stevens and Representative Jim McGovern, among others, made statements during the Authorization debate clearly restating that that Authorization did not operate domestically.</p>
<p>When President Bush failed to convince Congress to give him all the power he wanted when they passed the AUMF, he secretly assumed that power anyway, as if congressional authorization was a useless bother. But as Justice Frankfurter once wrote: &#8220;To find authority so explicitly withheld is not merely to disregard in a particular instance the clear will of Congress. It is to disrespect the whole legislative process and the constitutional division of authority between President and Congress.&#8221;</p>
<p>This is precisely the &#8220;disrespect&#8221; for the law that the Supreme Court struck down in the steel seizure case.</p>
<p>It is this same disrespect for America&#8217;s Constitution which has now brought our republic to the brink of a dangerous breach in the fabric of the Constitution. And the disrespect embodied in these apparent mass violations of the law is part of a larger pattern of seeming indifference to the Constitution that is deeply troubling to millions of Americans in both political parties.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In one of his typical defenses of tax cuts, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/kudlow/kudlow200601131453.asp">Lawrence Kudlow</a> claimed:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are a couple hundred billion dollars in farm and corporate-welfare subsidies that can easily be scrapped.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem these Bush minions were for pork barrel spending before they were against it, but I have to wonder as to Larry’s undocumented claim.  Table 3.13 of the national income product accounts from <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">BEA</a> suggested total subsidies for 2004 were only $43 billion not $200 billion.  So I tried to see if Google could help me figure out what Larry was talking about and I found something from <a href="http://members.aol.com/_ht_a/tma68/corporate_welfare.htm">Todd Altman</a> who thinks all transfer payments are morally wrong.  But he also wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Corporate welfare is defined by the Cato Institute as &#8220;any government spending program that provides unique benefits or advantages to specific companies or industries.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>as he linked to a <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/handbook/hb108/hb108-33.pdf">Cato publication</a> that identified less than $93 billion in &#8220;corporate welfare spending&#8221; of which $35 billion was attributed to agriculture.</p>
<p>It is interesting that the Cato publication disagreed with Mr. Altman on the morality issue as it found both pros and cons with regard corporate subsidies.  Also note that for the same year, BEA identifies only $38 billion in subsidies with $11 billion attributed to agriculture.  The Cato publication also said that the White House was committed to reducing corporate welfare and yet subsidies rose to $43 billion in 2004. </p>
<p>So how did Larry get his $200 billion figure for “farm and corporate-welfare subsidies”?  Let’s turn to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_welfare">Wikipedia</a> which notes that corporate welfare can be broadly defined as:</p>
<blockquote><p>a government&#8217;s bestowal of grants and/or <strong>tax breaks</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – if one decides to incorporate tax breaks into one’s definition of corporate welfare, one can get a much larger number than is reported in BEA’s definition of subsidies.  </p>
<p>If anyone has the opportunity, I’d like the following questions to be put to Mr. Kudlow.  How did he arrive at his $200 billion figure?  Did he really mean subsidies and other forms of corporate welfare such as tax breaks?  And isn’t he typically arguing FOR these tax breaks?  Now if he has changed his mind and is now against these types of tax breaks, I may have to agree with him on this point.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.prospect.org/web/page.ww?section=root&#038;name=ViewWeb&#038;articleId=10814">Greg Sargent</a> is advising Democrats on how to tie this GOP corruption to the fact that they will have to pay more both in taxes and at the doctor’s office and the pump with this choice comment:<br />
<blockquote>Some Dems, including ones charged with taking back Congress, say they think Dems should begin making the case more aggressively that GOP corruption is part and parcel of a larger alliance between the Republican Party and major corporations in certain sectors, particularly in energy and health care &#8211; an alliance, the argument continues, which shafts ordinary working- and middle-class Americans.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I think about how this line relates to the issue of “corporate welfare”, Gary seems to be saying that the GOP version of crony capitalism is causing average Americans to pay more for gasoline and more for health care – and a lot of these goodies to corporations are not line items in the Federal budget.</p>

                                <p>The National Retail Federation (NRF), citing tough comparisons, high energy costs and a slowing housing market, is <a href="http://www.nrf.com/content/default.asp?folder=press/release2006&#038;file=sales06.htm">forecasting</a> retail spending to grow 4.7% in 2006, compared to 6.1% in 2005.<br />
<blockquote>Facing new economic challenges in 2006, consumers may be forced to find new sources for spending power. The National Retail Federation (NRF) released its 2006 forecast today, predicting that retail industry sales (which exclude automobiles, gas stations, and restaurants) will increase 4.7 percent from last year. In its quarterly Retail Sales Outlook Report, released this morning at NRF&#8217;s 95th  Annual Convention &#038; EXPO, NRF expects a slowdown in the economy and consumer spending to restrain industry sales gains.<br />&#8230;<br />&#8220;With the housing market beginning to slow, consumers will be challenged to find new sources of spending power.&#8221; said NRF Chief Economist Rosalind Wells. &#8220;The strong retail sales we saw in the second half of 2005 will be replaced by more conservative spending in the New Year.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  Meanwhile, MarketWatch is <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B2BCE19FF-BA78-4AD6-B9C5-A6AFBC272C29%7D">reporting</a> that the U.S. economy slowed in the fourth quarter:<br />
<blockquote>The U.S. economy grew at the slowest pace in nearly three years in the just-concluded fourth quarter, economists now estimate.</p>
<p>Led by what could be the weakest consumer spending since 1991, the economy likely grew at about a 2.7% annual pace in the quarter after 11 straight quarters of growth above 3%, economists say.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Interestingly housing apparently remained strong in Q4:<br />
<blockquote>Housing was one of the few bright spots in the fourth quarter&#8217;s growth mix, along with inventory rebuilding. The weak sectors were consumer spending, business investment, exports and government spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>  There is some evidence that the housing market is finally slowing (more to come on housing in future posts).  Is the long anticipated consumer slowdown finally here?</p>

<blockquote>With tens of thousands of people unable to get medicines promised by Medicare, the Bush administration has told insurers that they must provide a 30-day supply of any drug that a beneficiary was previously taking, and it said that poor people must not be charged more than $5 for a covered drug.</p>
<p>The actions came after several states declared public health emergencies, and many states announced that they would step in to pay for prescriptions that should have been covered by the federal Medicare program.</p>
<p>Republicans have joined Democrats in asserting that the federal government botched the beginning of the prescription drug program, which started on Jan. 1. People who had signed up for coverage found that they were not on the government&#8217;s list of subscribers. Insurers said they had no way to identify poor people entitled to extra help with their drug costs. Pharmacists spent hours on the telephone trying to reach insurance companies that administer the drug benefit under contract to Medicare.</p></blockquote>
<p>At least this is the only time that the Bush administration has ever seemed incompetent at managing the US government.  Oh, wait&#8230;</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it might be fun to start compiling a list of Bush administration botches.  Any suggestions for other Bush Botches?</p>

                                <p>Apparently, I was not the only one reading <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/research/current_issues/ci11-12.html">this paper</a> by Matthew Higgins, Thomas Klitgaard, and Cédric Tille:<br />
<blockquote>Although the United States has seen its net liabilities surge in recent years, its investment income balance has remained positive—largely because U.S. firms operating abroad earn a higher rate of return than do foreign firms operating here. The continuing buildup in liabilities, however, should soon push the U.S. income balance below zero. In that event, net income flows will begin to boost the nation&#8217;s current account deficit instead of reducing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2006/01/us_investment_i.html">New Economist</a> provides a summary.  <a href="http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/002517.html">Daniel Drezner</a> asks “Why are Americans Better at FDI” providing several possible explanations.  See the comments to Dan’s post as well, which include Brad Setser discussing transfer pricing manipulation.</p>
