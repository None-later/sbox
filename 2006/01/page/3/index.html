                                <p>By overwhelming popular demand the colors are now back to something similar to the original design. I used Firefox (as all right-thinking web surfers should do) when I was testing the layout. Viewed in Firefox, the blog is comprised of nice muted tones and the panels are evenly spaced. However, it doesn&#8217;t look nearly as good in IE (not surprising, perhaps, since it&#8217;s been about 4.5 years since the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Internet_Explorer#Release_history">current version of IE was released</a>).</p>
<p>Attentive readers will have already noticed that (1) the blog slogan/subtitle has changed slightly to more clearly indicate that there are multiple bloggers posting here, and (2) there&#8217;s an &#8220;About Angry Bear&#8221; link in the Information section of the left panel.</p>

                                <p>UPDATE:  Gallup reports: <a href="http://poll.gallup.com/content/?ci=21004">Many States Shift Democratic During 2005</a>.  For a map of the Gallup results, see my post: <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2006/01/gallup-america-turning-blue.html">America Turning Blue</a>.</p>
<p>According to the American Research Group, Bush&#8217;s approval rating &#8220;<a href="http://www.americanresearchgroup.com/economy/">Returns to Record Low</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>George W. Bush&#8217;s overall job approval rating has returned to its lowest point in Bush&#8217;s presidency as Americans again turn less optimistic about the national economy according to the latest survey from the American Research Group. Among all Americans, 36% approve of the way Bush is handling his job as president and 58% disapprove. When it comes to Bush&#8217;s handling of the economy, 34% approve and 60% disapprove.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/640/approval.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/hello/243/2888/320/approval.jpg" border="0"></a><br /><i>Click on graph for larger image.</i></p>
<p>With 2 million jobs added in 2005 and solid GDP growth, why are so many Americans pessimistic about the economy? Are Americans feeling less financially secure, possibly because of the record levels of debt and debt service? As the WaPo reported this morning: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/22/AR2006012201027.html">As U.S. Economy Has Thrived, So Has Debt</a><br />
<blockquote>· U.S. household debt hit a record $11.4 trillion in last year&#8217;s third quarter, which ended Sept. 30, after shooting up at the fastest rate since 1985, according to Fed data.</p>
<p>· U.S. households spent a record 13.75 percent of their after-tax, or disposable, income on servicing their debts in the third quarter, the Fed reported.</p>
<p>· The trade deficit for last year is estimated to have swollen to another record high, above $700 billion, increasing America&#8217;s indebtedness to foreigners.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or does this poll reflect other worries, like the ongoing disaster in Iraq, the possible constitutional crisis and the GOP&#8217;s &#8220;culture of corruption&#8221;?</p>
<p>Personally, given Bush&#8217;s track record, I&#8217;m surprised 36% of Americans still approve of the way Bush is handling his job as president.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/cost-of-medical-care.html">Kash</a> has promised to spend a fair amount of time discussing the health care debate – a topic he assuredly knows far better than yours truly.  My contribution to this debate is to toss out a query that has been bugging me for quite a while and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-na-health23jan23,0,1934133,full.story?coll=la-headlines-politics">this article</a> by Peter Gosselin of the Los Angeles Times helps me both form the question and provides one possible answer to it:<br />
<blockquote>From the moderate right, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former Bush economic advisor and Republican-appointed director of the Congressional Budget Office, described the idea of tax deductions for people&#8217;s out-of-pocket medical expenditures as &#8220;really bad tax policy.&#8221; Holtz-Eakin, who is a fellow with the Council on Foreign Relations, warned that the deduction would tempt people to treat almost all of their spending as health-related and wreak havoc at the Internal Revenue Service. &#8220;I could make an argument that my running shoes are a health expense,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re preventive medicine.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Holtz-Eakin is asking the same question that I have.  The standard competitive model suggests that subsidies increase total expenditure on a product.  It is true that the price to consumers might fall from a subsidy but the price received by suppliers increase with the differential picked up by taxpayers.  The usual defense of subsidies in perfectly competitive markets (not that I’m saying the health care market is perfectly competitive) is that we assist poorer people by taxing the more well to do.  Since I own a few shares of Nike and happen to be a runner, I love this example.  Would it make sense to increase the tax burden on the working poor in order to subsidize my running and to increase Nike profits?  Well, the Bush approach seems to be subsidizing the health care needs of the well to do with a subsidy that would benefit doctors and pharmaceutical companies.  Who will pick up the tab for all of this?</p>
<p>But, but, the plan is supposed to reduce health care costs you say.  How so:<br />
<blockquote>Bush&#8217;s supporters say that the changes would help tame rocketing medical costs by encouraging people to buy their own healthcare insurance and become smarter shoppers, rather than relying on employers or government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid to cover their health costs. Critics argue that Bush&#8217;s expected proposals would undermine the employer-provided health insurance system that covers most working Americans. And, they say, it would encourage them to switch to the Bush-authored Health Savings Accounts, established in 2003, under which they would bear more of the financial risks of illness and injury.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see – the working poor have too much insurance.  For more on this theme – see <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_01/008063.php">Kevin Drum</a> who is not being timid about his criticism of Bush’s proposal.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2006/01/we_are_richer_t.html">David Altig</a> has two interesting points in one.  He notes the possibility that the income elasticity of health care spending may be greater than one, which could also mean that observing a time series as to what share of our income we spend on a product (such as health care) may be a poor metric for evaluating the efficiency or inefficiency of that particular market.</p>

                                <p>Unless there is some new math that really does say 1.08 divided by 131 equals 6%, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001922.html">Max Sawicky</a> is having fun with <a href="http://www.econopundit.com/archive/2006_01_01_econopundit_archive.html#113776728099808234">Steve Antler</a>.  But his On Reaganomics and Supply-side is truly sad as he simply accepts the latest spin from the op-ed pages of the <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007843">Wall Street Journal</a> as evidence as to the following issue:<br />
<blockquote>the proof lies wrapped up in the whole complicated question of how aggregate costs relate to output &#8211; and how taxes, laws (especially those related to property rights), and natural factors like weather and nonrenewable resource price movements, all impinge on the cost/output relationship. Let&#8217;s make it simple: supply side economics isn&#8217;t simply about whether tax cuts generate their own revenue fixes, but rather whether diminutions of central government&#8217;s role in the economy are matched (or even more-than-matched) by increases in private sector activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m scratching my head as to what this passage means especially since the growth rate of potential output slowed (more on this later) and government purchases as a share of output did not decline during Reagan’s administration.</p>
<p>Let’s also see what passages from the WSJ op-ed caught Steve Antler’s fancy:<br />
<blockquote>When Reagan proposed his 30% across-the-board tax-rate cut, his critics howled that this would cause demand to rise and lead to hyper-inflation. In fact, supply rose faster than demand … the moment the final leg of the tax cut took effect, in January of 1983, the economy roared to life with an expansion that lasted more than seven years … When the budget deficit rose in the mid-1980s, the liberals warned that if Reagan would not raise taxes interest rates would skyrocket. He didn&#8217;t and rates didn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>Such a masterpiece of odd terminology and weird timing!  First a couple of comments on timing.  Real interest rates did not skyrocket during the mid or late 1980’s as they had already risen to approximately 7% during the early 1980’s (the nominal interest rate on 10-year Federal bonds in 1983 average just over 11%, while inflation was around 4%).  As far as the “final leg” taking effect in 1983, I wonder if Stephen Moore is aware of the Ando-Modigliani lice-cycle model of consumption, which was used by Glenn Hubbard to defend the phased-in nature of the 2001 tax cut.  Simply put – the Kemp-Roth tax cut and the 2001 tax cut were sold as phased-in permanent tax reductions, which were supposed to boost consumption immediately.  And it turns out that the consumption to GDP ratio did rise early on in both cases.  </p>
<p>On terminology, I suspect most classical or market-clearing economists would argue that quantity supplied and quantity demand move together so to say supply rose faster than demand is pure gibberish.  But I’m a Keynesian who would argue that potential output in late 1982 (supply) far exceeded actual output (demand) so Moore has this exactly backwards – aggregate demand rose faster than potential output over the rest of the decade.  One simply way to capture the change in potential output over the Reagan-Bush41 era is to look at the growth from January 1, 1981 to December 31, 1992 as the economy Reagan inherited and the economy Clinton inherited were essentially the same in terms of the business cycle.  Whereas real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 3.5% for the second half of the twentieth century (Moore should know this as his free lunch supply-side colleague Lawrence Kudlow often notes this), average real GDP growth over the Reagan-Bush41 era was only 3.0%.</p>
<p>The real story of the 1980’s was that the Federal Reserve reacting (perhaps overreacting) to the Kemp-Roth tax cut by Volcker’s second dose of tight monetary policy.  While the FED’s response succeeded in reducing inflation, its dramatic reaction led to the 1982 recession and the FED’s subsequent easing of tight monetary policy allowed aggregate demand to eventually catch up with potential output.  Of course, classical economists at the time preferred to look at the long-run implications of this fiscal-monetary mix noting that the reduction in national savings would lead to less investment and slower long-term growth. </p>
<p>So as the Wall Street Journal wishes to praise Ronald Reagan on the twenty-fifth anniversary of his inauguration, I find it odd that we are reminded of Reagan’s greatest economic failure.  After all, candidate Reagan displayed more economic insight in his short passage “work, save, and invest” than Stephen Moore has displayed in all of his various attempts at writing on economics.  Alas, President Reagan’s actual fiscal policy undermined his hopes – something almost every economist realizes – but not Mr. Moore.  But then Mr. Moore writes:<br />
<blockquote>Perhaps the greatest tribute to the success of Reaganomics is that, over the course of the past 276 months, the U.S. economy has been in recession for only 15. That is to say, 94% of the time the U.S. economy has been creating jobs (43 million in all) and wealth ($30 trillion).</p></blockquote>
<p>Excuse me but this passage gives too much credit to fiscal policy and too little credit to the Federal Reserve.  Perhaps Steve Antler and Stephen Moore should read William Poole’s “Optimal Choice of Monetary Policy Instruments in a Simple Stochastic Macro Model” (<em>Quarterly Journal of Economics</em>, 1970). In the standard Keynesian model, lower tax rates do not reduce aggregate demand volatility – especially when politicians keep changing the course of fiscal policy from one Administration to the next.  Poole, however, pointed out that the FED could mitigate aggregate demand shocks – a lesson that the Volcker and Greenspan FEDs paid attention to. </p>
<p>I’m also been scratching my head to see if there is a good macroeconomic text that both recognizes the a reduction in national savings (as in George W. Bush’s excuse for tax cuts “give people their money back so they can consume more”) lowers long-term growth and was written by a conservative – and I suspect one by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0716752379/qid=1138042380/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/103-9376670-5007809?s=books&#038;v=glance&#038;n=283155">Greg Mankiw</a> should go to the top of Steve’s reading pile.</p>

                                <p>A week ago, <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/001906.html">Dean Baker</a> wrote:<br />
<blockquote>The latest news about Iran should be very scary to anyone old enough to remember the 2002 elections. Those who lived in that distant time will remember a president slumping in the polls in the wake of a sinking economy and an accounting scandal that centered on his Texas buddies at Enron. Recognizing the seriousness of the situation, President Bush’s team began raising the warning about Saddam Hussein and his WMDs.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wanted to say that Dean’s concern was tempered by this August 2005 article by <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/01/AR2005080101453.html">Dafna Linzer</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A major U.S. intelligence review has projected that Iran is about a decade away from manufacturing the key ingredient for a nuclear weapon, roughly doubling the previous estimate of five years, according to government sources with firsthand knowledge of the new analysis. The carefully hedged assessments, which represent consensus among U.S. intelligence agencies, contrast with forceful public statements by the White House. Administration officials have asserted, but have not offered proof, that Tehran is moving determinedly toward a nuclear arsenal &#8230; At no time in the past three years has the White House attributed its assertions about Iran to U.S. intelligence, as it did about Iraq in the run-up to the March 2003 invasion. Instead, it has pointed to years of Iranian concealment and questioned why a country with as much oil as Iran would require a large-scale nuclear energy program.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, ten years away is no imminent threat I said – and then I read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/17/AR2006011700893.html">Charles Krauthammer</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Makes you want to weep. One day earlier, Britain, France and Germany admitted that their two years of talks to stop Iran&#8217;s nuclear weapons program had collapsed. The Iranians had broken the seals on their nuclear facilities and were resuming activity in defiance of their pledges to the &#8220;E.U. Three.&#8221; &#8230; Ah, success. Instead of being years away from the point of no return for an Iranian bomb, as we were before we allowed Europe to divert anti-proliferation efforts into transparently useless talks, Iran is probably just months away. And now, of course, Iran is run by an even more radical government, led by a president who fervently believes in the imminence of the apocalypse. Ah, success. Having delayed two years, we now have to deal with a set of fanatical Islamists who we know will not be deterred from pursuing nuclear weapons by any sanctions. Even if we could get real sanctions. Which we will not. The remaining months before Iran goes nuclear are about to be frittered away in pursuit of this newest placebo.</p></blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t this Euro-bashing remind us of the 2002 UN-bashing?   I happen to trust the intelligence review even if Krauthammer does not.  There is no imminent threat from Iran.  But is it wise to trust Karl Rove not to be an imminent threat?  Which I guess was Dean’s point.</p>

                                <p>It should come as no surprise to anyone that, partly as a result of a persistently higher-than-average rate of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/cost-of-medical-care.html">inflation in medical care</a>, consumers have been spending a larger and larger fraction of their income on medical care.  </p>
<p>So how much of household spending actually goes to health care?  Well, that depends on whom you ask.</p>
<p>One good estimate is provided by the thorough surveys done by the <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/home.htm">BLS</a> to try to estimate the consumer price index.  The BLS provides a measure of the relative importance of various sorts of expenditures in the average household budget. The following chart shows how the portion of household spending devoted to medical care has steadily grown over the past two decades.  The chart breaks spending down in to two parts: direct out-of-pocket spending on health care, and individual premiums for health insurance.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/med_spending1.jpg"></p>
<p>It&#8217;s interesting to note that out-of-pocket health insurance premia actually remained quite constant through much of the 1990s, only to resume their rapid rise since the year 2000.  Most of the explanation for this is the massive shift of workers into HMOs during the 1990s, which were generally cheaper than traditional health insurance plans, in part because they covered less medical treatment.</p>
<p>Another measure of the importance of health care spending can be gleaned from  national income accounting statistics from the <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">BEA</a>.  The next chart shows the BEA&#8217;s measure of spending on medical care as a percent of total personal spending, and in real (inflation-adjusted) terms.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/med_spending2.jpg"></p>
<p>A couple of comments.  First, the BEA figures show a much greater proportion of spending going toward medical care, largely because the BEA includes payments by health insurance plans for medical care while the BLS figures shown in the first chart only include out-of-pocket payments by households.</p>
<p>Second, it is very interesting to notice that spending on medical care as a percent of total spending shows the same period of stability between 1992-2000 as the BLS figures on health insurance spending showed above.  The most compelling explanation for this period of stable health care spending of all types is therefore also the widespread shift of workers into HMOs during the 1990s.</p>
<p>Finally, notice what&#8217;s happened in the past few years: after that long period of stability, spending on medical care has risen dramatically since 2000.  Presumably, everyone who could be shifted into an HMO had made the switch by 2000, so that source of cost savings had been exhausted.</p>
<p>Most interestingly, the BEA data attributes much of this increase in health care&#8217;s budget share to an increase in <em>real</em> medical care spending, not to inflation.  In other words, the rapid advances in health care spending during the 2000s are largely due to the fact that individuals are consuming more health care, according to the BEA.</p>
<p>This seems rather at odds with the experiences of most people that I know.  What are some possible explanations?  I can think of a few.  It may be the case that HMOs are simply covering more medical services than they used to, and so individuals are indeed consuming more.  Or, it may be the case that the overall quality of medical care has improved, so that (for example) delivering a baby or getting a knee replaced is safer and more effective than it used to be.  In that case, 100 procedures performed today will be measured as greater consumption of real medical services than those same 100 procedures performed five years ago.  </p>
<p>A third possible explanation involves mis-measurement of inflation in medical care.  It is extremely difficult to differentiate between pure price changes and changes in quality when it comes to medical care.  The <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/cpi/cpifact4.htm">BLS document</a> that I cited yesterday notes the following:<br />
<blockquote>There is a growing consensus that the most appropriate way to measure hospital services is by tracking treatment outcomes rather than medical inputs consumed. From this vantage point, a day spent occupying a hospital room and the time in an operating room are not separate consumer services, but individual components of one hospital visit which may be all or part of a medical treatment. The current CPI method follows medical treatments, a method that lies between the old medical-inputs method and the ideal medical-outcomes method. Measuring the value of different treatment outcomes is the subject of research in the industry, but not yet a feasible methodology for the CPI medical care indexes.</p></blockquote>
<p>If it is the case that receiving any particular outcome (e.g. getting that knee replacement mentioned above) involves more elaborate and costly procedures but yields substantially the same outcome, then current statistical methods will show an increase in real medical services although they yield the same outcome as before.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the answers as to what is underlying dramatic change in medical care spending of the past few years.  But clearly its an important question, because it plays a crucial role in understanding whether the rapid rise in people&#8217;s spending on health care in recent years is a good thing or bad.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/">Kevin</a> points to the latest GOP attack on my party’s interest in national security &#8211; delivered by none other than <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/20/politics/20cnd-rove.html?hp&#038;ex=1137819600&#038;en=2aca7f5b75599a5c&#038;ei=5094&#038;partner=homepage">Karl Rove</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The United States faces a ruthless enemy, and we need a commander in chief and a Congress who understand the nature of the threat and the gravity of the moment America finds itself in,&#8221; Mr. Rove said. &#8220;President Bush and the Republican Party do. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for many Democrats.&#8221; &#8220;Let me be as clear as I can be: President Bush believes if Al Qaeda is calling somebody in America, it is in our national security interest to know who they&#8217;re calling and why,&#8221; Mr. Rove said, referring to the program in which the National Security Agency eavesdropped on conversations without getting a warrant from a judge. &#8220;Some important Democrats clearly disagree.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Last refuge of a scoundrel?  Try a serial liar who is more interested in attacking patriotic Democrats than making Americans safe from terrorism.  Kevin ties this outrageous lie from Karl Rove to the corruption issue writing:<br />
<blockquote>Now don&#8217;t get me wrong here. Corruption is a good issue for Dems if they can bring themselves to stop being so damn timid about it, and it&#8217;s also possible that Republicans will eventually discover that they&#8217;ve gone to the terrorism well once too often. Maybe. But I wouldn&#8217;t bet the ranch on it. Banging away on both corruption and the broader topic of Republican fealty to corporate special interests may help Democrats at the polls this year, but I don&#8217;t think national security is going away either. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not getting a sense that Dems are spending much time thinking about that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe our Democratic leaders are too timid but I’m stunned at the timidity of what Kevin writes here.  We Democrats are spending too little time thinking about national security?  Is he kidding?  We are thinking about national security – but whatever we say is either ignored by the Administration or twisted by their minions to accuse us of being soft on terrorism. </p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong – Kevin Drum is one of my favorite political bloggers, but this post was not up to his usual standards.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/corruption_in_washington_/2006/01/corruption_and_national_security.php">Mark Kleiman</a> provides the extra paragraph that I was hoping to see in Kevin’s post:<br />
<blockquote>It seems to me that the Democrats&#8217; play is obvious: point out that the Republicans have been stealing from the defense budget, using the Iraq adventure as a partisan piggy-bank and employment service, and otherwise sacrificing national security for corrupt partisan advantage. Repeat after me: &#8220;The price of Duke Cunningham&#8217;s Rolls-Royce would have bought a lot of body armor for the troops.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So if Karl Rove wants to talk about national security, great.  Let’s just point out how utterly incompetent this Administration has been at it.  Yes, we Democrats need to put forth our own agenda, but my point is many Democrats have been – only to have the rightwing either deny our suggestions or simply twist our words for partisan advantage.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>While <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/tamny200601200817.asp">John Tamny</a> does not explicitly have <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/113810">Dark Matter</a> in mind, his criticism of Martin Feldstein largely rest on the thesis:<br />
<blockquote>When he served under President Reagan as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors, Martin Feldstein called for a weaker dollar to reduce the U.S. deficit in the current account … Nearly twenty years later, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average trading at levels nearly four-times higher than when Feldstein initially sounded the alarm, the U.S. economy is still somehow imperiled as a result of investor interest in our public and private assets. Although Adam Smith saw capital inflows as “the effect, not the cause, of public prosperity,” Feldstein apparently sees them in a reverse light. According to his January 10 op-ed in the Financial Times, they’re indicative of a looming dollar crash … The problem here is that there’s no discernible correlation between the current account deficit and the value of the dollar … Feldstein is of the belief that the present level of foreign investment in the U.S. is unsustainable. Leaving aside how long the “sky-is-falling” crowd has been incorrect, what’s unsustainable is not the deficit itself, but the causes of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, we should be praising Martin Feldstein for his wisdom a generation ago – as well as his latest wisdom.  While Tamny notes that the nominal value of stocks may be substantially higher now than twenty years ago, note that nominal GDP has also tripled over this time period (can you say price increases and population growth).  It is true that household net wealth is about 4 times GDP versus 3.35 times GDP twenty years ago.  Twenty years ago, the U.S. investments abroad roughly equaled foreign investments in the U.S.  Today, foreign investments in the U.S. exceed U.S. investments abroad by roughly $3 trillion or 25% of GDP.  Feldstein and many others are worried that this foreign indebtedness will continue to rise relative to our national income.  </p>
<p>Tamny suggests correctly that we should examine the causes of the current account deficit.  First of all, correlations between the exchange rate and the current account do not get at the cause and effect relationships.  Feldstein was certainly not saying the exchange rate was the exogenous variable.  Rather, the exchange rate is an endogenous variable that responds to factors such as the relationship between national savings and investment.  We at the Angrybear have been arguing that it is this lack of national savings that has created the underlying conditions for why we have to rely on borrowing from abroad to finance the modest amount of investment that the U.S. is currently doing.  If we ever get around to fiscal responsibility, then the consequence should be a weaker dollar and improved net exports.</p>

                                <p>Some members of the FOMC are indicating that the Fed will be raising interest rates a little, but only a little bit more:<br />
<blockquote>LOS ANGELES (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/20/news/economy/fed_officials.reut/index.htm">Reuters</a>) &#8211; The Federal Reserve has lifted interest rates to more appropriate levels amid solid economic growth, policy-makers said Thursday in remarks that hint the U.S. central bank will raise rates just a few more times.</p>
<p>Financial markets bet the Fed will raise its benchmark fed funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 4.50 percent at its next meeting on Jan. 31. Observers also give a slightly better than 50/50 chance that rates will be raised again, to 4.75 percent, at the following meeting on March 28.</p>
<p>When asked by a reporter if the Fed was close to concluding its 1 1/2-year program of rate rises, San Francisco Fed President Janet Yellen replied: &#8220;Given what I know and what I&#8217;ve seen about the economy, based on the data, probably yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, the Fed is &#8220;not finished&#8221; and probably has &#8220;some&#8221; moves left to go, said Yellen, a voting member of the Fed&#8217;s rate-setting committee this year, after taking part in an economic panel discussion in Los Angeles.</p></blockquote>
<p>These comments are pretty much in line with almost everyone&#8217;s expectations, which is probably good.  Nevertheless, I am starting to worry a bit that, as the economy slows in 2006, we could find ourselves with an excessively <em>tight</em> monetary policy before too long&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>In keeping with my New Year’s resolution, let me say that I agree with <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/factor_kerpen200601190908.asp">Mallory Factor &#038; Phil Kerpen</a> with respect to at least part of the following:<br />
<blockquote>Currently, the long-term fiscal-policy outlook is bleak. A report issued last month by the Congressional Budget Office shows that federal spending as a percentage of the U.S. economy, a number that has never historically deviated much from 20 percent, is now scheduled to nearly double in size to 38 percent by 2050.</p></blockquote>
<p>Factor &#038; Kerpen are rightfully concerned about the tax burden that we will bestow upon our children and grandchildren if we continue to have current taxes set below government spending.  But when they bash the “Liberal public employee unions”, they somehow lose me – especially when they say the following:<br />
<blockquote>Government employees understandably would like to see the government take over as much of the U.S. economy as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find this allegation odd for several reasons.  The first reason relates to the following chart that shows the ratio of government employees to total employment (data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics).  Note that this ratio fell from 1993 to 2000 and then rose as a result of the increase in our security efforts following 9/11.  This ratio subsequently fell with the percentage of employment from the government now being around 16.25% as compared to around 17.25% when Bill Clinton took office.  So with a smaller share of employees working for the government, I thought the position of Factor &#038; Kerpen might be that public employees had received some massive increase in their real compensation.  In terms of total compensation relative to the consumer price index, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that those in public administration receive 8.67% more than they did at the beginning of 1993 as compared to a 7.41% increase in real compensation for all civilian employees.  </p>

<p>So why are Factor &#038; Kerpen angry at the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the Service Employees International Union?  It seems that Factor &#038; Kerpen want to reduce “entitlement spending” and they do not like <a href="http://www.actnow.org/video/simmons_index.php">this ad</a> where Act Now is opposing the efforts of the GOP to have an $8 billion per year reduction in spending following by tax cuts that are about twice as large.  If Factor &#038; Kerpen think reducing transfer payments by $8 billion and reducing taxes by $16 billion will reduce the deficit, they must be practicing new math.  </p>
<p>Of course, the real problem is that they have confused <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=transfer%20payments">transfer payments</a> with <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=government%20purchases">government purchases</a>.  As we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/2006-year-of-small-government.html">here</a> the ratio of non-defense Federal purchases to GDP has not change very much over the past half century.  Factor &#038; Kerpen are concerned that transfer payments will rise over time.  The long-run balanced budget constraint dictates that someone’s net taxes (taxes minus transfer payments) have to increase if policy makers cannot find a way to slash government purchases (a reasonable assumption).  So I share their general concern.  I would just hope someone over at the National Review finally realizes the difference between transfer payments and government purchases.</p>
