                                <p>I wanted to follow-up on a couple of aspects as to my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/bush-v-cheney-on-consumption-and.html">post</a> noting Dick Cheney hoping people would <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CHENEY_SAVINGS?SITE=7219&#038;SECTION=HOME&#038;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&#038;CTIME=2006-03-02-15-53-52">save more</a>.  </p>
<p>First of all – one of our readers is now saying Bush and his allies never said that the Administration wanted to give people their money back so they could consume more.  Yes – Bush said many times that he wanted to give us our money back EVEN THOUGH his government kept on spending it.  Then again – most folks see rising debt as deferred tax liabilities so this White House has not kept its promises to give us our money back.  But check out this <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0110/04/cf.00.html">Crossfire</a> transcript from October 4, 2001:<br />
<blockquote>WATTS: But Bill, I did hear you and Charlie saying that that tax relief package was too big. That &#8212; I have to disagree with that, simply because if 68 percent of the economy is driven by consumer spending, it&#8217;s healthy and it&#8217;s good for the economy to give people their money back to buy appliances or to buy food, to buy clothes, to help with house payments. That&#8217;s a good thing, and I think, you know, what we see ourselves drifting into post-September 11th &#8212; boy, let me tell you, that was very prophetic that we passed the tax package when we did. That&#8217;s good for the American people.<br />RANGEL: Suppose I agreed with you and said that it&#8217;s consumer confidence that we&#8217;re after, and we have to get that money out there. Why then would the Secretary of Treasury say that we ought to accelerate the tax cut with the middle income and why would Mr. Armey and Mr. Thomas talk about capital gains tax cuts? Talk about tax cuts for accelerated depreciation and expensing variety of things for the corporations. They&#8217;re not really investing, because they can&#8217;t get rid of the goods they have. So half of the stimulus package is a business package that the Republicans had before we went to war.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rangel is a Democrat who was hoping for a more effective aggregate demand stimulus back in October 2001, while Watts was a Republican Congressman echoing the White House line.  Back that was a while back.  So why is Dick Cheney still supporting tax cuts – this time for the long-run?</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The American dream begins with saving money and that should begin on the very first day of work,&#8221; Cheney told a conference here exploring how to encourage people to boost savings and be better prepared for retirement. Too often, workers are living paycheck to paycheck and are not saving sufficiently, Cheney said. Last year, Americans&#8217; personal savings rate dropped to its lowest point since the Great Depression. The dismal state of savings comes as a big wave of baby boomers will soon start retiring. That wave of retirees will eventually put massive strains on government resources as people draw on Social Security and Medicare benefits, Cheney said. Fewer workers, meanwhile, can be counted on to help bankroll the retirement program. &#8220;With an aging population, and a steadily falling ratio of workers to retirees, the system is on a course to eventual bankruptcy,&#8221; the vice president said … &#8220;There will always be a wagon load of excuses for ignoring the problem of entitlements,&#8221; Cheney said. &#8220;But Americans have a right to expect more out of the nation&#8217;s leaders, especially when it comes to Social Security and other defining national promises.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now making this speech takes a lot of gall coming from a White House that massively increased expected future entitlements with its overly expensive prescription drug benefit and even more massively reduced expected future taxes with its irresponsible tax deferrals, which they’d like to turn into permanent tax cuts.  But as far as I can tell – the only way that Dick Cheney intends to reduce the fiscal fiasco of his own making is to eliminate your future Social Security retirement benefits even as the government still collects payroll taxes.  Of course, this would make those who main form of savings is their payroll contributions to the Social Security program Cheney hopes to destroy worse off – not better off.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=71000001&#038;refer=us&#038;sid=aAZRH6MUBTlE">Robert Rubin</a> is correct:<br />
<blockquote>Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin urged fellow Democrats to reject President George W. Bush&#8217;s plan for a bipartisan commission to examine solutions to the mounting costs of Social Security and health care. Rubin, who served in President Bill Clinton&#8217;s administration, said Democratic leaders in Congress should instead insist Bush join them in a &#8220;fiscal commission&#8221; to discuss all options for cutting the budget deficit, including rolling back Bush&#8217;s tax cuts. </p></blockquote>

<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/10-yr-yield1.jpg"><br />Note: 10-year interest rate expressed in tenths of a percentage point, so &#8220;47&#8221; indicates 4.7%, etc.</p>
<p>Interest rates were higher for a few weeks during May and June of 2004, but other than that one must go back to 2002 to find long-term rates as high as they are today.</p>

<blockquote>Meet the typical American family.</p>
<p>It has about $3,800 in the bank. No one has a retirement account, and the neighbors who do only have about $35,000 in theirs. Mutual funds? Stocks? Bonds? Nope. The house is worth $160,000, but the family owes $95,000 on it to the bank. The breadwinners make more than $43,000 a year but can&#8217;t manage to pay off a $2,200 credit card balance.</p>
<p>That is the portrait of the median American household as painted by the Federal Reserve Board&#8217;s Survey of Consumer Finances. </p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, overall wealth in the US seems to have risen a lot in recent years.  But as PGL sagely reminds us from time to time, in real per capita terms much or all of that increase in illusory.  Very commonly, household debts have risen as fast or faster than their assets.  </p>
<p>By consuming instead of saving, the typical household has arrived at the situation described above: a dearth of readily accessible savings; the vast proportion of their wealth allocated to their house; and a huge resulting vulnerability to changes in the economy, interest rates, and personal fortunes.  In that sense (and not coincidentally), the situation of the typical household could be taken as a pretty good metaphor for the US as a whole.</p>

                                <p>Brad DeLong shares his lecture notes on the <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/Index.html">equity premium</a>:<br />
<blockquote>There is, somewhere, a marginal investor: somebody just about indifferent between stocks and bonds. If the expected return to stocks were a little higher, he or she would move more money to stocks. If the extra risk associated with holding stocks were a little lower, he or she would move more money to stocks. In either case, that increase in demand for stocks would push their prices up, and so push the relative returns on stocks&#8211;which are the dividends that will be paid out on stocks in the future divided by the stocks&#8217; current price&#8211;down. But this marginal investor fears the risk as much as he or she values the return, and so does not move more money into stocks, and that is why the current price of stocks and the current value of the equity risk premium are what they are.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at patterns of returns over the twentieth century, and try to figure out what this marginal investor has been seeing and thinking to make the equity risk premium what it has been, and then try to figure out what the current equity risk premium is.</p>
<p>&#8230;[I]n only 1% of the years in the twentieth century would investing in bonds for twenty years outperformed investing in stocks; and in that year&#8211;1929&#8211;the twenty-year returns to bonds would be only 8% ahead of the twenty-year returns to stocks. The equity premium puzzle is not due to the specific liquidity or collateral or other institutional properties of Treasury bills that make them especially valuable.</p>
<p>We have climbed into the box of the equity premium puzzle, which has now been locked and sealed with us on the inside. How are we going to get out of it?</p></blockquote>

                                <p>As I was reading another gem from <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/119607">Brad Setser</a> on the Dark Matter controversy (Brad links to a very nice paper by Carol Corrado, Charles Hutten, and Daniel Sichel that shows the investment/GDP ratio has declined even if one included investment in intangible capital), one of his readers points out an <a href="http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CHENEY_SAVINGS?SITE=7219&#038;SECTION=HOME&#038;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&#038;CTIME=2006-03-02-15-53-52">AP story</a> where Dick Cheney is telling people to save more.  While that might be sound advice and good for long-term growth prospects, I sort of recall President Bush justifying those tax “cuts” (actually deferrals of tax obligations) by saying he wanted to give people their money back so they could consume more.  Yes – we are ruled by idiots.</p>

<blockquote>Bottom line: as everyone knows, Abramoff was a lifelong Republican operative and steered the vast bulk of his clients&#8217; contributions to Republicans. The minuscule amount of money he steered to Democrats hardly changes that.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/gas-780309.JPG"><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/uploaded_images/gas-766161.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />As I was reading the <em>Economic Report of the President</em>, I figured it was time to revisit the issue of <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">gasoline prices</a> and the role played by refinery margins.  Our graph shows the retail price per gallon relative to the consumer price index (January 2006 = 1.00) from January 2000 &#8211; when the real gasoline prices were $1.51 per gallon – to January 2006 when gasoline prices were $2.32 per gallon.  Back in April of last year, real gasoline prices had increased to around $2.30 with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/05/increase-in-gasoline-prices-robert.html">Robert Novak</a> blaming the environmentalists for discouraging the building of new refineries over the past 30 years.  This argument was weird on several levels including the fact that the refinery margin has averaged less than 16% of the price of a gallon of gasoline over the past 6 years.  It is true that the contribution from the refinery margin shows a few spikes – such as the one following Katrina, but the contribution has not only averaged only $0.30 per gallon but also shows little upward trend.  </p>
<p>The <em>Economic Report of the President</em> makes the following points:<br />
<blockquote>Another related factor is that surplus refining capacity has declined substantially during the last 25 years. In the early 1980s, U.S. petroleum refiners were producing at only about 70 percent of their total potential production capacity. In contrast, total refiner output has been over 90 percent of capacity for the last decade. Several factors explain this trend. First, many small, inefficient refineries exited the industry in the early 1980s following the removal of poorly conceived Federal petroleum price and allocation controls that had favored such refineries. Without these controls, inefficient refineries were no longer profitable, and total U.S. refining capacity fell by 19 percent from roughly 19 million barrels per day at its peak in 1981 to about 15 million barrels per day in 1994. Second, low profitability in the refining sector during the early to mid 1990s did not provide the necessary incentive to expand total refining capacity … Refinery profitability increased in the late 1990s, however. As a result, domestic refining capacity rose 12 percent from 1994 to 17 million barrels per day in 2004 … Rising refinery costs and profits explain roughly one-quarter of the increase in average gasoline prices between 2000 and 2005 … Efficiency improvements and restructuring in the refining industry have led to lower operating costs per barrel. Excluding oil and other energy inputs, refinery operating costs fell roughly 20 percent between the early 1980s and 2003. These cost reductions tend to reduce the price of gasoline for consumers. Lower surplus capacity may, however, increase the sensitivity of gasoline prices to temporary disruptions in production at particular refineries … Although U.S. refining capacity and utilization have increased since the early 1990s, these increases in production have not kept pace with U.S. demand for gasoline and other refined products. As a consequence, U.S. imports of refined petroleum products, including gasoline, have grown from 11 percent of total refined product consumption in 1993 to 15 percent in 2004.  Demand for various types of petroleum products within a country and the configuration of its domestic refining capacity drive much of this international trade … Transport costs for refined petroleum products are sufficiently low that international trading can moderate the effects of regional price spikes. For example, when supplies of gasoline and other refined petroleum products ran short in the United States following Hurricane Katrina, and prices began to rise quickly, importers responded to this price incentive by delivering significantly more product to the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>Robert Novak’s disdain for tree huggers is only exceed by his disdain for President Carter – so I find it odd that he longs for the late 1970’s situation where petroleum refineries where producing at only 70% of their capacity.  Note the emphasis on the fact that low gasoline prices and low refinery margins were the main reason why companies did not build new refineries. Also note that efficiency gains have increased the production capacity of existing refineries as well as lowered the cost of refining oil into products such as gasoline.  I also found quite interesting the international trade aspects of this discussion – especially how trade can mitigate the effects of regional price spikes.  Finally, the discussion suggests that if the rising profitability of refineries is expected to continue, then market forces will create the incentives for production of more refineries even without some Cheney-style corporate welfare for the petroleum refineries.  While I suspect most true conservatives would prefer the normal workings of the market place over Cheney-style corporate welfare, Mr. Novak has been advocating the Cheney energy plan for the past 5 years.</p>

<blockquote>NEW YORK (<a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/03/01/Autos/carreviews/cr_top_picks/index.htm">CNNMoney.com</a>) &#8211; Japanese carmakers &#8212; or, more specifically, Honda followed by Toyota and Subaru &#8212; took all ten spots in this year&#8217;s Consumer Reports magazine top picks.</p>
<p>No American or European nameplates are represented in this year&#8217;s list, which is published in the April issue of Consumer Reports magazine.</p>
<p>The lone American model on last year&#8217;s list, the Ford Focus, was replaced this year by the new, redesigned Honda Civic.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/HPI.asp">House Price Index</a> was just released this morning with the data on house prices in the US for all of 2005.  The <a href="http://www.ofheo.gov/media/pdf/4q05hpi.pdf">press release</a> discusses its results for the US as a whole, reporting that:<br />
<blockquote>Average U.S. home prices increased 12.95 percent from the fourth quarter of 2004 through the fourth quarter of 2005. Appreciation for the most recent quarter was 2.86 percent, or an annualized rate of 11.4 percent. The increase during 2005 is similar to the revised increase of 12.55 percent for the year ended with the third quarter of 2005, showing no evidence of a slowdown.</p></blockquote>
<p>As I&#8217;ve said before, I prefer using the HPI data to look at individual real estate markets, since real estate markets are inherently local, and so different real estate markets can behave very differently.</p>
<p>The following picture shows the 6-month change in house prices in several &#8220;hot&#8221; housing markets, with a market defined as an individual Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA).  Prices were still rising strongly during the second half of 2005 in most of these markets, but the pace of appreciation moderated in all of them.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/hpi_05a.jpg"></p>
<p>The next picture shows the same thing for several markets that missed out on the huge price appreciations of 2002-05.  They seem to have experienced some increase in house price appreciation during 2005, but again, the rate of price increases in all of them were constant or falling in the second half of the year.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/hpi_05b.jpg"></p>
<p>This all seems quite consistent with what Calculated Risk wrote the other day: housing markets seem to be <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/02/housing-slowing-but-not-crashing.html">slowing, but not crashing</a>.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>There&#8217;s a new data release out this morning on <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/newsrel/pinewsrelease.htm">personal income and spending</a>.  The highlights:<br />
<blockquote> Personal income increased $75.2 billion, or 0.7 percent, and disposable personal income (DPI) increased $50.2 billion, or 0.5 percent, in January, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  Personal consumption expenditures (PCE) increased $76.7 billion, or 0.9 percent.  In December, personal income increased $54.8 billion, or 0.5 percent, DPI increased $47.6 billion, or 0.5 percent, and PCE increased $64.2 billion, or 0.7 percent, based on revised estimates.</p>
<p>&#8230;The January change in personal income was boosted by several special factors&#8230; Excluding these special factors, personal income increased $37.6 billion, or 0.4 percent, in January, after increasing $48.3 billion, or 0.5 percent, in December.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the headline figures are pretty good, below the surface I&#8217;m less happy about this report.  Much of the gains in income were one-time adjustments, and eaten up by higher prices.  Real income growth is still lower than I think we have a right to expect at this phase of an economic expansion; lately the trend annual growth rate has been in the neighborhood of only 2-2.5%.</p>
<p>Two measures of real (inflation-adjusted) income are shown in the graph below, along with consumer spending and savings.  The dark blue line shows disposable personal income (DPI), which is all income (worker compensation, interest earnings, rents, dividends, etc.) minus taxes.  The light blue line shows compensation only, which includes wages, salaries, and benefits paid to workers.  The red line shows consumption spending, while the green line shows the personal savings rate.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/incomejan06.jpg"><br />Note: All series deflated by the PCE deflator.  The effects of the one-time Microsoft dividend payout of December 2004 have been removed to better show recent trends.</p>
<p>While worker compensation grew nicely in the end of 2004 and first half of 2005, compensation growth has slowed markedly since then.  The broader measure of income (DPI) has recovered from some bad months last fall, but has still been growing only modestly since then.  Consumer spending continues apace, but, as has been the case for much of the past year, is being sustained by households drawing down on their savings, not by higher incomes.</p>
<p>Unless real incomes start to grow more strongly sometime soon, it seems very possible that consumer spending could soon start to slow.  And that is one of the principal reasons that I&#8217;m not very bullish about the economy in 2006.</p>
