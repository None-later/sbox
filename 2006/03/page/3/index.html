                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;ve been thinking some more about one of the points made in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/next-recession_22.html">my earlier post</a> about the policy tools that will be available to combat the next recession.  One thing struck me as deserving a bit more investigation: the role of fiscal policy in pulling the US economy out of the last recession.  Specifically, can we measure the role that government spending has played in the current recovery?  Put another way, can we quantify the good old-fashioned Keynesian effects of federal fiscal policy?</p>
<p>One obvious thing to do might be to look at changes in total employment, and changes in government employment.  If the government hired more people, then that would certainly have helped the US economy more generally.  But as the following chart shows, the government sector has not added an unusual number of jobs in recent years.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/empl_decomposition2.jpg"><br />Note: Federal employment data excludes Post Office employees.  Government employment for census years (e.g. the year 2000) is taken as the average between the year before and year after the census year.</p>
<p>While the federal government has stopped shrinking in terms of number of employees, neither has it grown much.  State and local governments have added workers to their payrolls, but not at an unusually rapid rate.  (Note that most of those new S &#038; L workers are teachers; about 800,000 of the S &#038; L employees added between 2000 and 2005 are in education.)</p>
<p>But this is a rather unsatisfactory analysis of the effect of increased government spending on the economy.  That&#8217;s because a large proportion of government spending &#8211; particularly at the federal level &#8211; doesn&#8217;t put more workers on the government payroll, but instead involves hiring private-sector firms to provide goods and services for the government.  For example, increased defense spending has largely gone toward more and larger government contracts to buy defense goods from the private sector.  That impact on the economy can not be measured by looking at government employment.</p>
<p>So instead I prefer a different approach.  In the following table I have decomposed changes in the total employment in the US into two broad categories: &#8220;job losses&#8221; due to higher productivity, since productivity growth means that the economy can produce any given amount of output using fewer workers; and &#8220;job gains&#8221; due to higher demand.  The table further breaks down the &#8220;job gains&#8221; due to higher demand into the major sub-categories of demand: C (spending by consumers), I (spending by businesses), M (imports), exports, and government spending.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/empl_decomposition1.jpg"><br />Sources: BEA national income data, and BLS employment data.<br />Note: For simplicity, I (unrealistically) assume that each type of demand growth has the same impact on employment.</p>
<p>Thanks to the rapid productivity growth of the period 2000-05, in 2005 the US economy could have produced everything that was demanded in the year 2000 using about 14 million fewer workers than were actually employed in 2000.  However, demand grew over that period, too.  So for example, higher consumer and business spending (with imports subtracted from those categories, since we should only count that spending in C and I that went toward domestically-produced goods and services) meant that around 11 million additional workers had to be employed in the US compared to what would have been the case if consumer and business demand had remained at year-2000 levels.  </p>
<p>The interesting thing to note is that higher government spending &#8211; and in particular higher spending by the federal government &#8211; accounted for an unusually large share of the growth in demand over the past 5 years.  Higher spending by the federal government meant that roughly two million more people had to be employed to meet that demand than would have been the case if federal spending had remained at the levels of 2000.  Note that of the $160 bn increase in annual real federal spending between 2000 and 2005, $130 bn of that was for defense spending.</p>
<p>What does this mean?  In a nutshell, this data tells a story of an economy that has been strongly influenced by federal government spending.  If it hadn&#8217;t been for the defense boom, in particular, it seems possible that the slow employment growth during the period 2000-05 would actually have been close to zero.  The tried-and-true Keynesian prescription of having the government spend its way out of recession seems to have worked.</p>
<p>Naturally, this analysis significantly understates the impact of fiscal policy on the economy over the past 5 years because it doesn&#8217;t attempt to measure the effects of the tax cuts.  It seems safe to suppose that a good portion of the increased consumer and business spending in recent years is the result of lower taxes.  Putting that together with this spending analysis would show that fiscal policy had an even larger role in the economic recovery.  </p>
<p>The implication for the next recession is sobering, however.  Given that the persistent federal budget deficit means that we are unlikely to see another surge in federal government spending, or another round of major tax cuts, fiscal policy probably won&#8217;t be able to come to the rescue the next time that there&#8217;s a recession.  Old-fashioned Keynesianism helped to rescue the US economy from the last recession.  But it won&#8217;t the next one.</p>

<p>If you look closely at the above list, you&#8217;ll see a category that sounds a lot like what we do here at Angry Bear: <a href="http://wampum.wabanaki.net/vault/2006/03/002519.html">Best Expert Blog</a>. And indeed, our blog is one of the finalists, for the third year running I believe. It looks like we&#8217;re currently being trounced by the estimable <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/">Pharyngula</a> (a really good blog focused mostly on biology, evolution, and octopus love). But the polls are still open &#8212; just record<a href="http://wampum.wabanaki.net/vault/2006/03/002519.html"> your vote</a> in the comments (please do not vote more than once).</p>

                                <p>It&#8217;s been quite amusing recently to watch conservatives such as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/balancing-budget-andrew-sullivans.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> wrestle with the question of how they would balance the budget.  The fundamental problem that they face is that the types of government spending that they want to cut just don&#8217;t add up to many dollars.  Similarly, the growth in spending that they imagine has happened under Bush has been confined overwhelmingly to those types of spending that they like.</p>
<p>The following table is an update of something I&#8217;ve put up before.  It takes the spending that was enacted for 2006 for all discretionary items and compares it to spending in 2001.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/budget_growth1.jpg"><br />Source: <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=7069&#038;sequence=0">CBO</a>.  2001 figures inflated by the change in the GDP price deflator to show them in 2006 dollars.  Figures include supplemental appropriations for 2006 for Iraq, Katrina, etc.</p>
<p>In per capita terms and adjusted for inflation, all non-defense discretionary spending grew by only 14% during the period 2001-06, which is an average growth rate of 2.7% per year.  Not exactly what I would call runaway growth.  </p>
<p>This brings me to one of the few ways in which I actually agree with Bush&#8217;s assessment of his own presidency: when he claims that he has held down the growth of non-defense discretionary spending, I think he&#8217;s basically right. The cause of today&#8217;s budget deficit is <em><strong>not</strong></em> the growth in non-defense discretionary spending.  The causes of the budget deficit are higher defense spending, higher health care costs, and tax cuts.</p>
<p>The implication, of course, is a simple one, though it still escapes many conservatives (though not all; see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/bartlett-on-taxes.html">Bruce Bartlett</a>, for example): it will be impossible to reverse the general fund deficit (i.e. the deficit excluding the SS surplus) of the past 5 years without doing some combination of a) cutting defense spending; b) radically reforming the nation&#8217;s health care system to bring down health care costs; and c) raising taxes.  Conservatives that honestly believe in fiscal prudence will have to embrace those options before they will ever be able to come up with a deficit-reduction proposal that is actually credible.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Perhaps it&#8217;s too early to think about what the next recession will be like &#8211; it seems like just yesterday that we were in the last economic slowdown.  But while people may disagree about when the next recession will strike, the odds of another recession happening at some point are 100%.  (Personally, I&#8217;m guessing sooner rather than later.) </p>
<p><a href="http://www.thomaspalley.com/?p=41#more-41">Thomas Palley</a> ruminates on the likelihood that the next recession will be deeper than the last one:<br />
<blockquote>After having been wrong once, it’s either brave or foolish to make a second prediction that the next recession will be deep and difficult to escape. But the facts point to it being just that—despite the optimism of the Federal Reserve. This is because the economic factors that helped escape the last recession have been largely exhausted, and will not be available to fight the next recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>His argument rests primarily on two major contentions:
<ol>
<li>Fiscal policy will be of little help in getting the economy out of the next recession, since budget deficits are already very high.</li>
<li>Monetary policy will also be of little help, since the primary channels through which lower interest rates helped to sustain the economy the last time around &#8211; by giving consumers lots of extra cash to spend due to mortgage refinancing and rising home values &#8211; won&#8217;t be available in the next recession due to a slowing housing market and already-low interest rates on most mortgages.</li>
</ol>
<p>For the most part I agree with Palley&#8217;s assessment of the situation.  In fact, reason #1 is one of my biggest concerns about the fact that the Republican Congress and President seem to have no inkling of how to balance the budget, even when the economy is relatively strong as it is today.  Due to their fiscal mismanagement, the US economy will enter the next recession with little available fiscal ammunition.</p>
<p>There does still remain a possible channel for policy to help ameliorate the next recession, however: low interest rates could stimulate a boom in business spending.  Business investment never really enjoyed the strong post-recession surge that is typical of most economic recoveries &#8211; the present expansion has been unambiguously led by consumer spending, not businesses.  So one could argue that maybe after the next recession we&#8217;ll be due for a good boom in investment.</p>
<p>Regardless, I think it&#8217;s safe to conclude at least one thing: the next recovery, whenever it happens, will look very different from this one.</p>

                                <p>AB reader JC suggests that I reply to <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/03/what_id_cut.html">this post</a>.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_03/008464.php">Kevin Drum</a> already has:<br />
<blockquote>• Repeal Medicare prescription bill. (This is funded out of the general fund, so it counts.) This program only started this year and contributed nothing to the 2005 deficit. Total savings: $0.<br />• Abolish earmarks. Total savings: $25 billion, although I&#8217;m being generous here.<br />• Abolish agricultural subsidies. Total savings: $30 billion.<br />• End corporate welfare. This typically refers to special tax treatment, so abolishing it is a tax increase, not a spending cut. Total savings: $0.<br />• Legalize marijuana and tax it. This is so speculative that it seems faintly absurd to include it, and in any case it&#8217;s a tax increase. Total savings: $0.<br />• Eliminate all tax loopholes. This is a tax increase. Total savings: $0.<br />• Abolish the NEA: Total savings: $.1 billion.<br />• Abolish the Education Department: Total savings: $65 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>For <a href="http://www.atrios.blogspot.com/">Duncan Black’s</a> reply, see his Wonking Sullivan: <br />
<blockquote>Let&#8217;s try to separate the things which are tax increases and those which are spending cuts.</p>
<p>Tax increases:<br />Repeal estate tax cut<br />A dollar a gallon gas tax increase<br />Eliminating all tax loopholes (?) and deductions except the charitable deduction.</p>
<p>Spending cuts:<br />Repealing Medicare drug plan.<br />Abolish agricultural subsidies.<br />Eliminate NEA and Department of Education.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Kevin pointed out, the Medicare drug plan was not responsible for those past deficits, which by General Fund accounting often exceeded $600 billion a year.  Also, cutting the Department of Education budget would either mean we reduce our investment in education or require shifting the tax burden for doing so back onto state and local governments.</p>
<p>But what about this from Sully:<br />
<blockquote>Means-test social security benefits, index them to prices rather than wages, extend the retirement age to 72 (and have it regularly extended as life-spans lengthen) </p></blockquote>
<p>Fine – if we decide to cut Social Security benefits in order to privative Social Security, wouldn’t that also imply that we would be reducing payroll contributions?If so, these joint reductions do nothing to reduce the General Fund deficit.  Of course, we could cut benefits and keep payroll contributions at their current levels, which should be seen as a backdoor employment tax increase.  </p>
<p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002086.html">Max Sawicky</a> notes that Sullivan’s recommended tax increases would go a long way to balancing the budget.  So, Sully is for tax increases on at least some of us.</p>

Kevin writes:<br />
<blockquote>Bush&#8217;s tax cuts haven&#8217;t touched Social Security or Medicare taxes (and both programs run surpluses anyway). They&#8217;ve been solely cuts in personal and corporate income taxes, dividend taxes, and capital gains taxes. These are the taxes that fund discretionary spending. Discretionary spending in 2005 was roughly $1 trillion. About half of that was for defense and national security, which Sullivan doesn&#8217;t want to cut. That leaves $500 billion, which funds the entire rest of the federal government. The federal deficit for 2005 was over $400 billion. So: if you support the tax cuts, and you don&#8217;t want to cut defense spending, and you want a balanced budget, you need to slice about $400 billion out of the $500 billion that&#8217;s left. These are round numbers, but you get the idea.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we are going to preserve Al Gore’s “lock box” with respect to the Social Security Trust Fund, the proper accounting of the Federal deficit is that General Fund deficit running near $600 billion a year.  So even if we eliminated all programs outside of defense and national security, we would need tax increases to balance the budget.</p>

                                <p>There has been a lot of recent discussion about how to measure savings. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2006/03/rising_real_net.html#comments">Michael Mandel</a> defines the issue thusly:<br />
<blockquote>Real net worth per capita is household net worth, minus credit market liabilities of federal state and local governments, adjusted for inflation and population growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Savings represents the increase over some time period in real net worth.</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/record-net-wealth.html">Yesterday</a> I posed a question to him as to how he defines government debt with his answer in the comment section of his post as well as mine.  While my preferred definition of government debt would include the Federal government’s obligations to the Social Security Trust Fund, his does not and importantly should not because of how the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/Current">Flow of Funds</a> accounting defines household net worth.  </p>
<p>The error of my thinking as I formed the question goes something like the following intergenerational tale.  Let’s imagine some middle-aged liberal (like myself) who is hoping that the Bush Social Security deform efforts flop so that the Trust Fund reserves that I have been paying into for the last generation will be used to supplement my private retirement funds over the 2020 to 2040 period.  As such, I would consider my share of these reserve funds as an asset as I would consider the total amount of Federal debt – and not just the portion held by the public – as deferred tax liabilities for my generation and that generation of 20-somethings that include those young Republicans who for some odd reason support George Bush’s tax shift onto their backs.  But the Flow of Funds accounting does not include the Trust Fund reserves as part of household net worth and Michael is correct not to include the corresponding liability portion of the total amount of Federal debt.  As such the following makes sense:<br />
<blockquote>In 2005, real net worth per capita was $155.1 thousand, compared to $148.9 thousand in 2004 and $153.4 thousand in 1999 (all in 2005 dollars).</p></blockquote>
<p>Bottom line – the average (as in mean) American has saved a grand total of $1700 over the past six years.  That sounds about right to me.</p>

<blockquote>President George W. Bush on Monday signed into law a $781 billion increase in U.S. borrowing authority, making the Treasury Department&#8217;s new debt limit $8.965 trillion, White House spokesman Scott McClellan said.</p></blockquote>
<p>  We could have a morose contest; pick the date of the next debt limit increase.  Right now the US is adding about $600 Billion per year to the National Debt.  So it will take a little more than one year to add $781 Billion in debt.  </p>
<p>My guess is August 24, 2007.</p>
<p>I also believe the National Debt will be above $10 Trillion when George W. Bush&#8217;s 2nd term expires in January 2009.</p>

                                <p>Greg Ip of the Wall Street Journal interviewed Treasury Secretary Snow last week about the subject of income inequality.  From <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114281167065802514.html?mod=home_whats_news_us">today&#8217;s article</a>:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Treasury Chief Says Many Benefit From Expansion; Some Data Show Otherwise</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON &#8212; Confronting criticism of the Bush administration&#8217;s economic record, Treasury Secretary John Snow said the widening gap between high-paid and low-paid Americans reflects a labor market efficiently rewarding more-productive people. But he insisted Americans are still broadly sharing in the economic expansion.</p>
<p>&#8230;Mr. Snow, a former CEO of CSX Corp. who holds a doctorate in economics, said the administration intends to publicly challenge perceptions that typical workers and families haven&#8217;t benefited much from the economic expansion.</p>
<p>Mr. Snow distributed a fact sheet that showed after-tax income per person, adjusted for inflation, rose 8.2% from January 2001, when George W. Bush took office as president, through January 2006. The sheet also showed that per-person net worth &#8212; total assets minus debt &#8212; rose 24%, unadjusted for inflation, from early 2001 to the end of 2005. &#8220;People have more money in their pocket&#8221; and in their bank accounts, he said.</p>
<p>&#8230;Other data suggest the typical family has seen little advance in income or net worth since Mr. Bush took office. Census Bureau data show median family income &#8212; half of families have income greater than the median, half have less &#8212; fell 3.6% from 2000 through 2004. Incomes for the poorest families fell even further. The only group to gain was the family at the 95th percentile &#8212; that is, richer than 95% of all families.</p>
<p>&#8230;As for net worth, a triennial Federal Reserve survey found that the net worth of the median family rose 1.5%, after inflation, from 2001 through 2004. That is far less than the 17% increase from 1995 to 1998 and the 10% increase from 1998 to 2001.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg Ip deserves his usual kudos for providing some good context for Snow&#8217;s comments.  One additional thing that Ip could have mentioned regarding the rise in wealth is that it is not really true that Americans have &#8220;more money in their pockets and bank accounts&#8221;.  The level of real per capita financial wealth of US households is still lower than it was in 1999 or 2000.  All of the growth in household net worth since then is due to high house prices.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the administration seems to want to use the same approach to the problem of income inequality as they use with respect to Iraq: their goal is to change the American public&#8217;s perceptions of each issue, rather than to change what&#8217;s actually happening.   I suspect that their new PR offensive on the issue of income inequality will probably meet with the same success as their efforts to convince people that things are going well in Iraq.</p>

I have periodically looked at overall <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/10/kudlow-malpass-tamny-definition-of.html">household net worth</a> in real per capita terms noting that the NRO cheerleaders who periodically trumpet real wealth levels are ignoring the twin facts that both population and prices have risen over time. </p>
<p>I happy to point out that this cheerleading might finally be justified.  Well, not in terms of a record net wealth to GDP ratio as the first graph shows.  But then, let’s be fair – real GDP has grown since 1999 both in absolute terms and in per capita terms.  The second graph shows that real wealth was 7.9% higher at the end of 2005 than it was at the end or 1999.  And with population growth being 6.1%, the third graph shows that real wealth per capita was 1.7% higher at the end of 2005 than it was at the end or 1999.  </p>

<p>So is the average American wealthier today than he was six years ago?  Not quite for two reasons.  First of all,  average in terms of median is different than average in terms of mean.  Secondly, as <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/economicsunbound/archives/2006/03/rising_real_net.html#comments">Michae Mandel</a> often does, we should consider the deferred tax liabilities from government debt:<br />
<blockquote>Real net worth per capita is household net worth, minus credit market liabilities of federal state and local governments, adjusted for inflation and population growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>But I’m not following Michael’s calculations.  Expressing real wealth in terms of 2000$, we had $153,311 per person in household wealth in 1999 and $155,965 in 2005 – an increase of $2655.  Federal debt per person rose from $20,404 in 1999 to $23,662.  So hasn’t our real wealth per capita fallen by approximately $600?</p>
