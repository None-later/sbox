                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last week the Fed released its <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/Current/">Flow of Funds</a> (FOF) data for all of 2005.  The FOF data keeps track of changes in various types of assets and liabilities for each sector (and many major industries) of the economy.</p>
<p>One piece of the FOF data that I find particularly interesting is the picture that it paints of household finances in 2005.  The following table displays the annual changes in the assets and liabilities of US households over the last several years.  </p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/household_balance_sheet.jpg"><br />Sources: FOF tables F.100 and B.100.  Note that this data is actually for households and nonprofit organizations.  Nonprofit assets are estimated to comprise about 6% of the total combined category.</p>
<p>A couple of aspects of this data strike me as interesting.  First of all, for the seventh year in a row, US households aquired more financial liabilities than they did financial assets.  Naturally, this is due to the fact that much of the debt taken on by households was taken on to buy real estate.  The escalating price of real estate meant that in 2005 the gap between the financial assets that households aquired and the financial liabilities they incurred was by far the largest ever.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note that households (and their pension funds) were net sellers of equities during 2005.  Unlike in 2000, when the value of equities owned by households fell because of the fall in the stock market, in 2005 the stock market actually rose slightly, so the decline in the value of equities owned by households must be due to fact that households were net sellers of stocks during the year.  </p>
<p>Putting this point together with the previous point means that, over the past few years, US housholds have been shifting the composition of their assets substantially away from financial assets &#8211; especially equities &#8211; and toward real estate.  The following chart illustrates how households have altered their asset porfolio over the past 40 years.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/household_portfolio2.jpg"></p>
<p>Some obvious features of this picture are the general trend toward holding more wealth in the form of equities (this includes mutual funds and pension account balances), and the large spike in equities as a fraction of household assets that happened in the second half of the 1990s as a result of the great stock market boom.  But over the past few years the dominant trend has been the rapid growth in real estate as a share of household wealth &#8211; to levels higher than at any time in recent history.  Households even have far more of their wealth tied up in their house than they did in the 1960s or 70s, when stock market investment was almost unheard of for most households.</p>
<p>Note that this picture vastly understates the role of real estate in the typical family&#8217;s assets, since the huge majority of equities are owned by only the very richest Americans; the typical household actually has just <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/state-of-american-household-finances.html">a few thousand dollars in equities</a>, so 90% or more of the their wealth is typically in the form of real estate.</p>
<p>An interesting question is why households have elected to put an increasing share of their wealth into houses in recent years.  I&#8217;m not sure I have a good answer to that question.  But put this all together, and it provides a reasonable explanation for the <a href="http://www.realtor.org/publicaffairsweb.nsf/Pages/HousingWealthHasGreaterEffectThanStocks?OpenDocument">evidence</a> that suggests that consumer spending is quite a bit more sensitive to changes in real estate wealth than it is to changes in stock market wealth.  The next few years may be an interesting test of this relationship.</p>

                                <p>I’m Irish albeit a Protestant but on this wonderful day, I’d love to be in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/03/17/dublin.stpaddy.ap/index.html">Dublin</a> where the concerns seem to be limited to the chilly weather and too many beers (no, I have not had one YET).  The folks in <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/03/17/st.patricks.day.ap/index.html">Savannah, GA</a> are also having fun, but then we turn to <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/03/17/stpatricks.gays.ap/index.html">New York City</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Protesters joined bagpipers, marching bands and thousands of flag-waving spectators at the St. Patrick&#8217;s Day parade Friday after the parade&#8217;s chairman compared gay Irish-American activists to neo-Nazis, the Ku Klux Klan and prostitutes. As huge, happy crowds lined the streets, the chairman, John Dunleavy, sidestepped questions about his remarks to The Irish Times. &#8220;Today is St. Patrick&#8217;s Day. We celebrate our faith and heritage, everything else is secondary,&#8221; he said before the start of the Fifth Avenue parade. Dunleavy set off a firestorm this week when he told the newspaper: &#8220;If an Israeli group wants to march in New York, do you allow Neo-Nazis into their parade? If African Americans are marching in Harlem, do they have to let the Ku Klux Klan into their parade?&#8221; Referring to the Irish Lesbian and Gay Organization, Dunleavy said, &#8220;People have rights. If we let the ILGO in, is it the Irish Prostitute Association next?&#8221; On Thursday, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn, who is gay, blasted Dunleavy for the comments. Quinn, who is Irish, declined to participate in the parade after organizers barred an Irish gay and lesbian group from marching under its own banner for a 16th straight year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can we put this gay bashing aside for just one day?  </p>
<p>Happy St. Patrick’s Day!  And have a beer on me.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Now that Blogger is letting me post again&#8230;</p>
<p>This morning the Fed released <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g17/Current/default.htm">data on industrial production</a> &#8211; production in the manufacturing, mining, and utilities sectors of the economy &#8211; as well as capacity utilization in the US.  From the press release:<br />
<blockquote>Industrial production increased 0.7 percent in February after a decrease of 0.3 percent in January. The output of utilities jumped 7.9 percent in February, as the weather moved closer to seasonal norms after January’s warm temperatures&#8230; At 110.9 percent of its 2002 average, overall industrial output in February was 3.3 percent above its February 2005 level. Because of the jump in utilities output, the rate of capacity utilization for total industry rose 0.4 percentage point, to 81.2 percent, a level just above its 1972-2005 average of 81.0 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>In May of 2004 the US finally regained its production levels of the year 2000, and since then it has continued to grow nicely (with a slight wobble last year thanks to Katrina).  However, despite the rising production of the past few years, the nation&#8217;s factories, mines, and utilities still have plenty of spare capacity.  Production has grown solidly, but US producers have added new productive capacity at nearly as fast a rate as production has grown, so capacity utilization has only crept up gradually.  The picture below illustrates.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cap_ut_feb06b.jpg"></p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting situation &#8211; the US economy has enjoyed several years of fairly good economic growth, and is (arguably) probably near the peak of the business cycle.  Yet there&#8217;s still nearly as much unused productive capacity in the economy today as there was during the protracted economic slump of 1991-93.  </p>
<p>An obvious question to ask is why US firms continue to add additional productive capacity instead of using exisiting capacity more fully.  One possible explanation may be unusually rapid transformation of US industry.  If the spare capacity that exists is in different industries from those that are growing, we would expect to see the excess capacity in &#8220;old&#8221; industries remain unused while the &#8220;new&#8221; industries add new capacity to keep up with rising production, leaving US aggregate capacity utilization lower than expected at this point in the business cycle.  A more detailed industry breakdown of capacity utilization indexes might help test this hypothesis&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/pnoonan/?id=110008093">Peggy Noonan</a> is shocked that President Bush is not fiscally responsible.  As she still worships St. Ronald Reagan, Ms. Noonan is not about the blame the tax cuts:<br />
<blockquote>This week&#8217;s column is a question, a brief one addressed with honest curiosity to Republicans. It is: When George W. Bush first came on the scene in 2000, did you understand him to be a liberal in terms of spending? The question has been on my mind since the summer of 2005 when, at a gathering of conservatives, the question of Mr. Bush and big spending was raised. </p></blockquote>
<p>OK, we have been over this before so let’s turn to a USA Today article written by Dennis Cauchon on March 14 entitled <em>Federal Aid Programs Expand at Record Rate</em>, which Ms. Noonan quotes:<br />
<blockquote>A USA Today analysis of 25 major government programs found that enrollment increased an average of 17% in the programs from 2000 to 2005. The nation&#8217;s population grew 5% during that time. It was the largest five year expansion of the federal safety net since the Great Society created programs such as Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960&#8217;s. Spending on these social programs was $1.3 trillion in 2005, up an inflation-adjusted 22% since 2000 and accounting for more than half of federal spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ms. Noonan then notes:<br />
<blockquote>The paper quoted a liberal think tanker saying the increase in the number of people on programs is due to a rise in the poverty rate. It quoted a conservative congressman countering that entitlement programs should not be growing when unemployment is near record lows. Arguments about the report and its numbers will ensue.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Congressman is Gil Gutknecht from Minnesota. </p>
<p>Table 3.16 from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a> details government expenditures by functions and has annual data through 2004 (table’s figures are in billions of $).  Over the four-year period, nominal expenditures have increased by 33.5%.  Retirement benefits and health care benefits are by far the largest items.  Expenditures on retirement benefits have increased only modestly considering the general increase in prices and the aging of the population.  Expenditures on health care have increased dramatically in part because this Administration has done a poor job in terms of creating a more efficient health care system.  </p>

<p>But let’s return to Congressman Gutknecht’s confusion as to the state of the labor market.  Notice that unemployment benefits are a small part of entitlements.  Also notice that unemployment benefits rose by 71% as the labor market was weaker in 2004 than it was in 2000.  Transfer payments related to poverty are a more significant portion of the Federal budget than unemployment benefits.  I trust Congressman Gutknecht understands that poverty has increased since 2000.  </p>

                                <p>Mike Crapo has joined James DeMint, Rick Santorum, Lindsey Graham, and Tom Coburn with another spin on Social Security privatization that <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/kerpen200603160808.asp">Phil Kerpen</a> endorses:<br />
<blockquote>The DeMint-Crapo amendment puts the possibility of meaningful, pro-worker Social Security reform back into play. If the Democrats are smart they will latch onto it before the train leaves the station. The amendment starts off with the obvious: Social Security funds should be used only for Social Security. Many Americans are surprised to learn that billions of dollars are taken out of Social Security each year in a congressional raid that funds everything under the sun &#8211; except worker retirement &#8211; and in the process masks the true size of the federal deficit. That practice could end under this new amendment. The DeMint-Crapo amendment creates a reserve fund in the budget that could be used to fund legislation protecting Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>Social Security contributions are already placed fund into a Trust Fund.  If these Republican Senators wanted to make sure that the Federal government stops raiding the piggy bank, they would do something about reducing the General Fund deficit – such as paying for the Iraq debacle with tax increases.  If you suspect that Mr. Kerpen forgot to tell you the real story behind this proposal, check out <a href="http://www.politicspa.com/Press_Releases/062305dscc2.htm">this review</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Republicans Rick Santorum, Lindsey Graham, Jim DeMint, Mike Crapo and Tom Coburn are scheduled to hold a press conference this morning announcing their plan to privatize Social Security by raiding the Social Security surplus. Not only would this plan reduce benefits, but would also make Social Security’s financial problems worse and add billions to our nation’s deficits. Rather than working to protect Social Security, these Republicans are up to their same old tricks: trying to privatize Social Security while making the long term health of Social Security worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>The discussion continues with the following headings:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Create New Budget Problems: Taxes Would Have to Be Increased, or Programs Slashed</p>
<p>Make Social Security’s Financing Problems Worse: Accelerate Insolvency, Add $64 Billion to Deficit, $600 Billion in Debt</p>
<p>Reduce Guaranteed Benefits</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – more dishonesty from the GOP and the National Review.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Even <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/blog/2006/03/a_pathetic_state_of_affairs_by.html">Lawrence Kudlow</a> understands that the Republicans in Congress can’t stop themselves from raiding themselves from raiding our retirement benefits:<br />
<blockquote>After all the GOP Congressional talk about newfound budget-cutting religion, including earmark transparency and reform, so far they have produced nothing. People like Arlen Specter, and many others, are still trying to get their pet projects funded. So, what else is new? Gregg has thrown in the towel on mandatory spending cuts because he says he doesn&#8217;t have the votes. Well then, I don&#8217;t think that the American people should &#8220;have the votes&#8221; to keep the Republicans in charge of the Senate&#8211;or the House for that matter. This is a pathetic state of affairs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Larry – well said!</p>
<p><strong>Update II:</strong> The <a href="http://www.spokesmanreview.com/tools/story_pf.asp?ID=121201">Spokesman-Review</a> reports on how Senator Crapo gets his campaign funds:<br />
<blockquote>BOISE – U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, R-Idaho, received more than twice as much money in donations from people in the U.S. Virgin Islands than from his home state last year, according to the Federal Elections Commission.  That prompted the Senate Majority Project, a Democratic interest group, to question Crapo&#8217;s involvement in the islands, which have a population of 110,000 people. Crapo had received $39,000 from Virgin Islands residents by the end of the 2005-06 election cycle, compared with just under $20,000 from Idaho residents. Lobbyists for the islands are trying to reduce the number of days a person must remain on the islands to be considered a resident, an issue that could have tax benefits. Currently, under a 2004 act of Congress, individuals must spend at least half the year in the Virgin Islands to be considered a resident for tax purposes. Lobbyists would like to see that reduced to an average of 122 days per year over a three-year period. Crapo, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, is looking into the issue. </p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This morning&#8217;s release of <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">consumer price inflation</a> data for February by the BLS indicates that, for yet another month at least, any inflation pressures caused by last year&#8217;s sharp rise in energy prices has not been passed on into the prices of other goods.  The inflation rate faced by consumers for things other than food and energy has remained remarkably stable for the past two years (in the neigborhood of 2% p.a.), as the heavy blue line in the chart below illustrates.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/cpi_ppi_feb06.jpg"><br />Note: The blue lines show consumer price inflation, the red lines show producer price inflation for finished goods.  The &#8220;core&#8221; rate excludes food and energy prices.</p>
<p>The bad news is that the overall inflation rate has eroded the purchasing power of consumers at a 3% annualized rate over the past 6 months, and by about 4% over the past year.  But it is reassuring to see that there has been no pickup in non-energy inflation during the past year, because that suggests that inflation rates will moderate in 2006 compared to 2005.  (For more about why the core inflation rate is a useful piece of data, see &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/inflation-measures.html">Inflation Measures</a>&#8220;.)</p>
<p>In other words, I continue to grow more confident that the US has absorbed the shock of higher energy prices without any broader inflationary effects on the US economy.  I remain firmly in the camp of those more worried about output slowing than inflation rising in 2006.</p>

                                <p>Two of the most dishonest expressions among George Bush’s standard rants are “giving you your money back” and “priorities”.  How else would one explain the following two stories.  The <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11839552">AP reports</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In both the House and Senate, Democrats have long pushed for more money for ports only to have the Republican-controlled Congress reject their efforts, largely along party lines. House Democrats are making another attempt this week now that the issue is fresh in lawmakers’ minds because of the DP World deal.</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/15/politics/15spend.html?ex=1300078800&#038;en=166d4cc1fb2cffb5&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">New York Times reports</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Senate Republicans on Tuesday narrowly defeated an effort to impose budget rules that would make it harder to increase spending or cut taxes, a move that critics said that showed Republicans were posturing in their calls for greater fiscal restraint … But Republicans said the push to add the rules to the budget was a back-door effort to make it harder to extend President Bush&#8217;s tax cuts. </p></blockquote>
<p>It was a tax deferral – not a tax cut.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The good news is that <a href="http://www.rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12561-1.html">Senator Harkin</a> has a spine.  As for the lack of support from other Democratic Senators, see the debate between <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_03/008426.php">Kevin Drum</a> and <a href="http://glenngreenwald.blogspot.com/2006/03/stirring-defense-of-indecision-and.html">Glenn Greenwald</a>.  I’m with Glenn on this one.  </p>
<p>Some of the <a href="http://mydd.com/story/2006/3/14/15566/6597">left</a> are rightfully blasting <a href="http://www.progressnowaction.org/page/petition/allardapologize">Senator Allard</a> for this:<br />
<blockquote>Yesterday, in an interview for Fox News Radio, you accused Senator Russ Feingold (D &#8211; WI) of &#8220;[siding] with terrorists&#8221; by introducing a resolution to censure George Bush.</p></blockquote>
<p>Didn’t Dick Cheney say essentially the same thing about the “junior Senator from Wisconsin” even before the censure motion was made.  Of course, the <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/editorial/editors200603150758.asp">National Review</a> leaps at the opportunity to repeat these lies: <br />
<blockquote>The Democrats had just concluded a successful two-week bout of eroding the president&#8217;s national-security credentials with baseless attacks on the Dubai ports deal. Now, the party&#8217;s Left apparently believes it&#8217;s time to switch back to type and bolster Bush&#8217;s national-security credentials by demonstrating the Democrats&#8217; own lack of seriousness in the War on Terror … The resolution will surely strike most Americans as mindless partisanship. It also shifts the political debate back to ground favorable to the White House. The NSA program is relatively popular, indeed is one of the administration&#8217;s most popular initiatives at the moment. The White House has a good case to make on its legality, and Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee last week seemed to signal their willingness to acquiesce to a deal giving congressional blessing to the program in exchange for enhanced oversight. Feingold hopes to blow this all up. Republicans should gladly rise to his challenge. Increasing Feingold&#8217;s prominence as a spokesman for the Democrats on the War on Terror only benefits the GOP. He epitomizes the Left&#8217;s do-nothing, or at least do-the-absolute-minimum, approach to the war. He voted against the Patriot Act, and its reauthorization. He opposes the NSA program. He was against the Iraq war, and opposes using coercive interrogation against terrorists abroad. </p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind the fact that we can wiretap legally under the FISA act.  Never mind the fact that Bush’s actions are clearly a violation of the FISA act, which is constitutional (in spite of Senator Specter’s flip-flopping claim to the contrary).  Never mind the clearly partisan attacks from the dishonest demagogues like Dick Cheney.  The last sentence in this NRO tirade undermines their whole spin.  The decision on March 19, 2003 to invade Iraq helped Al Qaeda.  So Senator Feingold’s opposition to this stupid decision shows he is more serious about the war against terror than the political hacks and general idiots in the White House.</p>
