                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/fiscally-realistic-conservative.html">Bruce Bartlett’s post</a> on his NYTimes blog last week highlighted the long-term fiscal problems faced by the US.  He mentioned that his preferred solution would be to impose a national value added tax (VAT) to help close the gap between expected federal revenues and spending.  His most recent NYTimes post (see <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/03/the_best_tax_ev.html">Mark Thoma</a> for excerpts, if you don&#8217;t have <a href="http://bartlett.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=12">Times Select</a> access) elaborates on why he thinks the VAT is a good solution to a big problem.</p>
<p>Several people have since noted that before any additional taxes are considered, we should first simply reverse the Bush tax cuts of 2001 and 2003.  The problem, however, is this: it turns out that even reversing the Bush tax cuts will not be nearly enough to solve the US’s true fiscal problems over the coming decades.  </p>
<p>As they do every year, in December the CBO released their analysis of the budgetary implications of several spending and revenue scenarios in the document “<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6982&#038;sequence=0">The Long-Term Budget Outlook</a>”.  I’ve distilled their multiple scenarios down to one picture representing what I think is a reasonably likely “intermediate” (i.e. not too sunny and not too doomsday-ish) projection.  </p>
<p>To get this “intermediate” projection I do the following:
<ul>
<li>I exclude Social Security revenues and spending, since Social Security is separately funded from the rest of the budget, and because the purpose of this exercise is to focus on the future imbalances in the rest of the federal budget, which dwarf those of the Social Security trust fund.  (The SS gap is only around 1-2% of GDP in the decades after 2020, compared to the much larger numbers you’ll find below.)  </p>
</li>
<li>On the revenue side, I use the CBO’s estimate based on an extension of current law governing the individual income tax.  In other words, the Bush tax cuts are allowed to expire (most of them in 2010).  After that, real bracket creep (real income growth pushing taxpayers into higher tax brackets) and the AMT cause total revenues to gradually rise.
</li>
<li>Regarding spending, I assume that the excess cost growth in Medicare and Medicaid is only 1.0 percentage point per year (compared to the average past rate of health care growth of 2.5 percentage points above overall economic growth).  I also follow the CBO’s projections that assume that defense spending follows the Administration’s 2006 Future Years Defense Program (with allowances for cost risks and additional spending to support the war on terrorism) through 2024, and that other types of spending (except for interest payments on the debt) remain at their historical levels as a share of GDP.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you put these assumptions together you get the following picture:</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/gen_fund_deficit.jpg"></p>
<p>Obviously, even with the end of the Bush tax cuts in 2010, the picture is ugly.  The general fund deficit (i.e. the deficit excluding the SS trust fund) will be close to 4% of GDP during 2010-2015, and widen to 4.6% of GDP by 2020, 6% of GDP by 2025, and 8% of GDP by 2030.  After that the fiscal problem gets so bad that there’s no point in following things further.</p>
<p>Maybe you disagree with my assumptions.  Fine – you can play this game yourself.  Mix and match your own assumptions about revenues and spending with the help of the handy spreadsheet available from the CBO <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6982&#038;sequence=0">here</a>.  It might make for a fun party game.  (I guess that depends on your definition of &#8220;fun&#8221;, though.)</p>
<p>But whatever specific choices you make, I think that you’ll find that under all reasonable scenarios there’s a huge fiscal problem looming for the US that is totally unrelated to Social Security.  </p>
<p>So now for the tough part: What are some possible resolutions to this problem?  There are only a few options, so it’s quite easy to enumerate them:
<ol>
<li>Just live with the deficits.  It is certainly possible to live with budget deficits of 3, 4, or 5% of GDP.  We&#8217;ve done it in the past, and we&#8217;re doing it currently.  However, by the 2020s we&#8217;ll be in a completely different situation: the deficit will be large and growing far faster than the economy.  Put another way, the deficit will be growing as a fraction of the economy just to make the interest payments on the debt.  Such a situation is literally unsustainable &#8211; it is the equivalent of a pyramid scheme.  If the picture presented above still holds true by the 2020s, US will find itself unable to finance its deficit at any reasonable rate of interest, simply because lenders will (quite reasonably) doubt the ability of the US government to repay its debts when they come due 10 or 20 or 30 years down the road.  So living with the picture above is simply not an option.</p>
</li>
<li>Cut non-defense discretionary spending.  This is many conservatives’ favorite answer, but since such spending is only 5.1% of GDP in the projection above in the year 2025, even slashing such spending in half would still leave a large deficit.  But I think that such speculation is irrelevant; recent <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060329/ap_on_go_co/congress_budget;_ylt=AvxSi2CIDVnwr0btSUTI2gys0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA3OXIzMDMzBHNlYwM3MDM-">hesitation even among Republicans</a> to cut discretionary spending from current levels seems to indicate that such spending has already been cut by as much as is politically tolerable.  So this option is a non-starter, I think.
</li>
<li>Cut defense spending.  The scenario graphed above assumes defense spending of only about 3% of GDP in the year 2025, however (compared to about 4% of GDP currently), so again we find that even cutting such spending in half would leave a huge problem.  More relevantly, I think that it would be politically difficult to do much cutting here in the first place, so again I am comfortable ruling out this option.
</li>
<li>Totally change our health care system.  The federal government could stop providing health benefits to the nation’s retirees… but again I find that politically unlikely.  Alternatively, some sort of major health care system reform that generated massive cost savings and rationalization of medical care services – such as a move to a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/politics-of-single-payer-health-care.html">single-payer health insurance system</a> – could do the trick. (This would be my preferred solution to the problem, incidentally.)
</li>
<li>If you rule out fundamental changes to health care, and if you agree that options #2 and #3 are not going to help you much in closing the massive general fund deficit, then you’re left with only one more option: raising taxes.  Such new tax revenues would need to be on the order of 5% of GDP, at least to start with.  For context, note that the federal income tax raises about 10% of GDP in taxes, so raising such new revenues through the income tax would require an approximately 50% rise in income taxes.  Alternatively, you could consider adding a completely new tax, such as the VAT.</li>
</ol>
<p>Given this list, I think that Bruce Bartlett’s logic for favoring the VAT is thus pretty good; if you rule out options #1-4 above, and you don’t think that voters will tolerate a 50% increase in income taxes, then a VAT may make the most sense.  In an upcoming post I’ll discuss the pros and cons of a VAT in a bit of detail.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Some of you have wondered why I haven&#8217;t yet made much of an effort to distinguish between legal and illegal immigration.  It’s a fair question.  Let me share my thoughts with you about the two, and explain why my sentiments about immigration in general mean that I don’t worry much about the distinction between the two. </p>
<p>Personally, I tend to see immigration as a positive thing.  It helps the people immigrating, and it makes the US population as a whole stronger, richer, more creative, and more connected to the rest of the world.  This analysis applies to both kinds of immigrants, legal and illegal. </p>
<p>But could there be reasons why one might want to reduce illegal immigration while leaving legal immigration rules alone?  Let me try to compile a preliminary (and surely incomplete) list of reasons why one might want to reduce the number of illegal immigrants without allowing them legal entry as an alternative.
<ol>
<li>Lots of illegal immigrants come to the US every year.  Therefore, if you simply want to cut down on the number of total immigrants to the US, one way would be to make stronger efforts to reduce illegal immigration while denying the deterred illegal immigrants the option to legally enter the US.  (Alternatively, you could reduce the number of legal immigrants allowed.)</p>
</li>
<li>By far the largest source country of illegal immigrants is Mexico.  So if you want to change the mix of the country-of-origin of immigrants coming in to the US (i.e. have a smaller proportion of immigrants come from Mexico), then again a good tactic would be to specifically try to reduce illegal immigration.
</li>
<li>Illegal immigrants, being in a precarious legal situation, are more easily taken advantage of by employers.  If your concern is the well-being of the illegal immigrants, a sensible tactic would be to try to reduce the number of illegal immigrants.  However, a corollary to that is that you should also want them to be legally allowed to remain in the US (since they obviously want to be here, given that they are willing to do it illegaly), in which case efforts to reduce illegal immigration should be coupled with an increase in legally allowed immigrants.  On the other hand, if your concern is the effect of this phenomenon on the US labor market, then we can combine this item with #4 below&#8230;
</li>
<li>Illegal immigrants may be poorer and less well-educated (on average) than legal immigrants.  This (possibly combined with #3 above) could have effects on the domestic market for unskilled labor in the US.  If you want to try to address such concerns by changing the mix of the income/educational level of immigrants coming to the US, then one way might be to reduce illegal immigration while maintaining legal immigration at current levels.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are probably other reasons to consider, but let me work with this as a start, and try to explain why my predisposition in favor of immigration covers both the legal and illegal kind.</p>
<p>Personally, I don’t think that there are too many immigrants in the US.  If anything, I think the US should accept more immigrants than it currently does.  This is the whole point behind my occasional arguments in favor of immigration in general.  I am therefore not in favor of clamping down on illegal immigration for reason #1.</p>
<p>I also have no problem with the country mix of immigrants; I don’t think that immigrants from Mexico are inherently better or worse to have in the US than immigrants from any other country.  So reason #2 doesn’t persuade me to want to reduce illegal immigration flows.</p>
<p>I am concerned about issue #3.  I think that the plight of illegal immigrants in the US is often horrible, and a disgrace to a country like the US.  This pushes me in favor of reducing illegal immigration, but only if it’s replaced with more legal immigration.  If we imposed harsher penalties on illegal immigrants while simultaneously allowing an extra few hundred thousand legal immigrants (<em><strong>not</strong></em> the horrible &#8220;guest worker&#8221; idea, but fully legal immigrants) to enter the US every year, I might be okay with that.</p>
<p>Issue #4 may be the most difficult one to resolve.  It really is a part of the deeper question of how much should the US try to shape the type of immigrants that we allow.  Perhaps the US should more actively try to change the mix of immigrants toward more high-skill individuals.  That would raise the average skill-level of the US population, and reduce the downward wage pressures on unskilled workers in the US.  From a cost-benefit point of view, changing the mix of immigrants in such a manner would certainly be better for the US than the current system.  </p>
<p>However, from a moral point of view that seems potentially problematic.  Is it better to allow a doctor from Nigeria to come to the US and increase his standard of living from being relatively well-off in Nigeria to being relatively well-off in the US, instead of allowing a farm worker from Mexico come to the US and transform the situation of his children from being hungry, sick, and illiterate to getting basic nutrition, health care, and education?  And is it okay to deliberately try to deprive the poorest parts of the world of their best-educated people?</p>
<p>This in turn relates to the still deeper question of why we allow immigration in the first place: is the goal to improve the US, or is it to improve the lives of the individuals who want to immigrate?</p>
<p>For me, both goals matter, at least to some degree.  I&#8217;m more sympathetic toward that poor Mexican farm worker than I am toward the Nigerian doctor, but the Nigerian doctor will probably make me (and the rest of the US) a tiny bit richer than the Mexican would.  To me, those two effects roughly balance out.  As a result, I’m not particularly in favor of changing the rules to only allow high-skilled immigrants in to the US.  I can see the logic of it (it’s really an economist’s logic, after all), but it doesn&#8217;t satisfy my sense of morality.  </p>
<p>That said, I do worry about the income inequality in the US that unskilled illegal immigrants might cause (due to both items #3 and #4).  But I worry about income inequality in the US much more generally than that.  Income inequality is a huge problem in the US, and the problem is much bigger than immigration can account for.  My preferred policy response to income inequality would therefore be to try to address income inequality much more directly, for example by improving basic education for lower-income people or by changing the tax code, not through the back-handed method (one with many negative side-effects) of reducing unskilled immigration.</p>
<p>Putting this all together, I find that I don&#8217;t worry about illegal immigration any more than I worry about legal immigration.  I&#8217;d like there to be fewer illegal immigrants, but only because I&#8217;d like more of them to be able to enter the country legally.  Put another way, I could possibly favor harsher treatment for illegal immigrants, and I’d even be willing to pay for stricter border enforcement&#8230; but only if those policy changes were accompanied by a much more liberal legal immigration policy, and a policy to bring current illegal immigrants into fully legal status.  </p>
<p>Note that I am not advocating completely open borders &#8211; I think that some sort of limit on legal immigration is reasonable, simply because overly rapid population growth in the US would cause its own set of problems.  However, current population growth in the US is only about 1% per year, including immigration.  That is near the lowest levels of population growth ever experienced in the US &#8211; only in the 1930s was it lower.  I think the US can handle a bit more than that.</p>
<p>I realize that I am probably in the minority on this one (no pun intended)&#8230; but you asked for my opinion, and now you have it.  Have fun in the comments.</p>

                                <p>Simpsons aficionados among you already know that the Simpsons addressed the issue of immigration back in 1996, in the episode “Much Apu About Nothing”.  Here’s a summary of the beginning of the episode, thanks to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Much_Apu_About_Nothing">Wikipedia</a> (Btw, I never would have guessed that Wikipedia contains entries on individual Simpsons episodes&#8230;)<br />
<blockquote>On an ordinary day, a bear strolls onto Evergreen Terrace. It is quickly subdued by the police, not before accidentally shooting and capturing Barney Gumble. Homer rants about these &#8220;constant bear attacks&#8221;, even though this is the very first bear Ned has seen in his forty years of living on that street. Homer then leads an angry mob and demands that Mayor Quimby do something about this. Soon, the Bear Patrol is created, a useless organization which even makes use of a B-2 Spirit. Homer then gets just as shocked [as] when he saw the bear when he discovers that taxes have been raised five dollars to maintain the Bear Patrol.</p></blockquote>
<p>After that, the angry mob returns to the mayor’s office, yelling &#8220;Down with taxes!  Down with taxes!&#8221;  The mayor has to do something&#8230;<br />
<blockquote><strong>Quimby:</strong> Are those morons getting dumber or just louder?</p>
<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> <em>[Takes a moment to check his clipboard]</em> Dumber, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Quimby:</strong> They want the bear patrol but they won&#8217;t pay taxes for it.  This is a situation that calls for real leadership.  <em>[Opens the door to his office to confront the angry mob.]</em>  </p>
<p>People, your taxes are high because of illegal immigrants!</p>
<p><strong>Moe Szyslak: </strong> Immigants!  I knew it was them!  Even when it was the bears, I knew it was them.</p></blockquote>
<p> Let’s not confuse fiction with reality, though.  I certainly can’t believe that politicians in real life would ever raise the issue of immigration to cover up for their failures in other areas of policy, such as taxes, government spending, income inequality, education, health care&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A propos of recent discussions regarding immigration, I thought it worthwhile reposting the link to a relevant paper that I quite like: Gianmarco Ottaviano and Giovanni Peri, &#8220;<a href="http://papers.nber.org/papers/w10904">The Economic Value of Cultural Diversity: Evidence from US Cities</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>What are the economic consequences to U.S. natives of the growing diversity of American cities? Is their productivity or utility affected by cultural diversity as measured by diversity of countries of birth of U.S. residents? We document in this paper a very robust correlation: US-born citizens living in metropolitan areas where the share of foreign-born increased between 1970 and 1990, experienced a significant increase in their wage and in the rental price of their housing. Such finding is economically significant and survives omitted variable bias and endogeneity bias. As people and firms are mobile across cities in the long run we argue that, in equilibrium, these correlations are consistent only with a net positive effect of cultural diversity on productivity of natives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Being the child of two immigrants to the US, I feel like I have personal experience supporting my firm belief that the greatest benefits of immigration to a country are quite subtle, very pervasive, and difficult to measure.  Traditional studies that try to tally up the costs and benefits of immigration usually focus on the taxes paid by immigrants, the direct impact of immigration on labor markets, and the government services that they receive.  Typically such measures <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/Immigration.html">show a rough balance</a>, some showing a slight gain to the native-born population, and some showing a slight loss. (All show large gains for immigrants themselves, of course, as well as large gains for the overall population including both immigrants and natives.) </p>
<p>But the approach taken by Ottaviano and Peri is a good effort at trying to identify one of the less tangible effects of immigration: its impact on the productivity of non-immigrants.  Their result is striking.  In cities with more immigrants, the non-immigrant population tends to get paid more, and the market tends to value real estate higher, implying that the city is generally viewed as a more desirable place to live.  They use some careful and rather clever econometrics to ensure that the causation runs from more immigrants to higher pay for non-immigrants, rather than the other way around.  After all of their controls for other determinants of non-immigrant wages, and after taking account of the fact that richer cities would be expected to attract more immigrants, they still find a statistically robust and positive residual effect of immigration on the income and productivity of non-immigrants.</p>
<p>Exactly why diversity improves the productivity of native-born Americans is a bit of an open question, though I suspect it has to do with the rich variety of viewpoints, experiences, and ideas that a diverse community offers.  Regardless, it is not at all surprising to me that this paper shows the effects of immigration to be large, robust, and very beneficial.</p>

<blockquote>But how likely is it that the Laffer curve is causing revenues to rise, as opposed to normal operation of the business cycle? Not much, in my opinion.  First of all, the Laffer curve came to prominence during a period when the top tax rate on dividends was 70 percent and the rate on long-term capital gains was 40 percent. Economist Arthur Laffer correctly pointed out that a 100 percent tax rate would raise no revenue and that rates close to this would reduce revenue below what a lower rate would bring in. Given the tax rates in existence, it was plausible to argue that a reduction in the top rate and capital gains tax would raise revenue. However, when President Bush took office, the top rate on dividends was down to 39.6 percent and the rate on long-term capital gains was just 20 percent—far below the rates Ronald Reagan inherited. It is very implausible that these rates were in the “prohibitive” range of the Laffer curve, such that a rate reduction would raise revenue. But even if we grant the theory, how likely is it that the recent rise in revenue owes anything to this effect? Again, not much. The fact is that it is only in very exceptional circumstances that there would even be the possibility of a tax cut that would so stimulate growth that it would pay for itself. Even the Bush Administration admits this. The 2003 Economic Report of the President (pp. 57-58) says, “Although the economy grows in response to tax reductions…it is unlikely to grow so much that lost tax revenue is completely recovered by the higher level of economic activity.” Recent academic research suggests that feedback effects would offset only a fraction of the static revenue loss, that which would result from no effect on consumption or incentives. A 2004 study by Harvard economists N. Gregory Mankiw and Larry Weinzierl found that a cut in taxes on capital might recoup 17 of the static revenue loss in the first three years and a cut in taxes on labor could recoup 13 percent. Mankiw served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bush. A study by the Congressional Budget Office in December 2005 found that a tax rate cut would recoup at most 20 percent of the static revenue loss in the first five years. Overall federal revenues are just barely back to where they were five years ago in nominal terms.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the comment box of Brad’s post, we see a link to <a href="http://gsbwww.uchicago.edu/fac/austan.goolsbee/research/laf.pdf"> Evidence on the High-Income Laffer Curve from Six Decades of Tax Reform </a> written by Austan Goolsbee in 1999:<br />
<blockquote>This paper has used evidence from seven different tax changes since 1922 to examine the evidence in support of the high-income Laffer curve and the New Tax Responsiveness Literature &#8230; While that work emphasizes the potential importance of behavioral responses to marginal tax rates, the results in this paper suggest that the evidence on which those conclusions are based—evidence from the 1980s—is atypical in the historical experience. Using the same methods that NTR authors have used for the 1980s, the elasticities of taxable income calculated for other tax changes seem to be much more modest with several indistinguishable from zero. This is true in the aggregate cross-sectional tax return data as well as in panel data on executive compensation. The largest estimates of the taxable income elasticity from all of the previous historical periods is lower than the smallest estimates of the elasticity in the literature based on the 1980s. Given the importance of the behavioral response to taxation, it is my hope that this will stimulate further research on the topic using data outside of conventional tax returns in the 1980s and 1990s. The notion that governments could raise more money by cutting rates is, indeed, a glorious idea. It would permit a Pareto improvement of the most enjoyable kind. Unfortunately for all of us, the data from the historical record suggest that it is unlikely to be true at anything like today’s marginal tax rates. It seems that, for now at least, we will have to keep paying for our tax cuts the old fashioned way.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-immigration26mar26,0,6454895.story?coll=la-home-headlines">LA Times</a> covers the reason why I decided not to go into the office on Saturday:<br />
<blockquote>Joining what some are calling the nation&#8217;s largest mobilization of immigrants ever, hundreds of thousands of people boisterously marched in downtown Los Angeles Saturday to protest federal legislation that would crack down on undocumented immigrants, penalize those who help them and build a security wall on the U.S. southern border. Spirited crowds representing labor, religious groups, civil-rights advocates and ordinary immigrants stretched over 26 blocks of downtown Los Angeles from Adams Blvd. along Spring Street and Broadway to City Hall, tooting kazoos, waving American flags and chanting &#8220;Si se puede!&#8221; (Yes we can!). The crowd, estimated by police at more than 500.000, represented one of the largest protest marches in Los Angeles history, surpassing Vietnam War demonstrations and the 70,000 who rallied downtown against Proposition 187, a 1994 state initiative that denied public benefits to undocumented migrants. The marchers included both longtime residents and the newly arrived, bound by a desire for a better life and a love for this county.</p></blockquote>
<p>I say good for them!  <a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/014383.html">Talkleft</a> covers the LA protests as well as <a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/013417.html">HR 4437</a>, which is the legislation that prompted this protest. </p>
<p>Whereas Pat Buchanan is against not only the free flow of goods but also against allowing more immigration, I’ve expressed my general sentiments for free trade in goods as well as capital – so it would be hypocritical of me not to support labor mobility even across national borders.  I bring up Mr. Buchanan as he recently stated that President Bush is to the left of Senator Clinton on this issue.  </p>
<p>Even as I want to say I support the President’s position, we should note what <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_03/008498.php">Kevin Drum</a> said about the guest worker proposal:<br />
<blockquote>If we truly decide that we want to keep immigration limited, then we should face down the low-wage business bloc of the Republican Party and get serious about keeping illegal immigrants out of the country in the first place. But if we want to allow more legal immigrants into the country — as a guest worker program tacitly acknowledges — then we should encourage them to be good citizens by offering them the chance to earn actual citizenship. Because they don&#8217;t do that, guest worker programs end up perpetuating both a culture of low-wage labor that&#8217;s ripe for exploitation and insular communities that have no incentive to think of themselves as Americans — because they aren&#8217;t. It&#8217;s the worst of both worlds.</p></blockquote>
<p>While <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/03/should-they-stay-or-should-they-go.html">Andrew Samwick</a> is generally supportive of President Bush’s efforts, he seems to agree with Kevin on this particular point.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>David Brooks appeared on the St. Patrick’s Day edition of <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/political_wrap/jan-june06/bo_3-17.html">The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer</a> and made this sensible comment:<br />
<blockquote>You choose the reality you want to see. And, then, the Clinton years, when you had the reverse, this time, it was the Republicans&#8217; turn to be more pessimistic and wrong. People choose the reality that flatters themselves.</p></blockquote>
<p>This statement certainly applies to those small government conservatives who worship at the alter of St. Ronald Reagan – as witnessed by all the recent revisionist history as to the level of Federal spending relative to GDP during the 1980’s.  But it was this statement that drew fire from <a href="http://mediamatters.org/items/200603210007">Media Matters</a>:<br />
<blockquote>People choose the reality that &#8211; that flatters their partisanship. For example, in the Reagan years, unemployment went from 13 percent to 5 percent. If you asked Democrats, at the end of that, did unemployment go up or down under Reagan, 60 percent said it went up. Republicans said down. </p></blockquote>
<p>I know conservatives love to paint Jimmy Carter as an awful President but doesn’t Mr. Brooks have inflation and unemployment confused here?  After all, the highest unemployment rate in the post World War II era was 10.8% &#8211; not 13% &#8211; and that occurred a couple of years into the Reagan term of office.  If you are old as I am, you might recall the 1984 GOP campaign slogan called <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007843">Morning in America</a> with the operative lie being put forward to voters back then that it was Jimmy Carter who presided over the 1982 recession.  Yes, we had a recession during Carter’s term, just as we had a recession during Bush41’s term.  In both cases, the economy was slowly recovering with the unemployment rate just over 7% when their Administrations were turned over to Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, respectively.  </p>
<p>Also notice this line from the recent WSJ oped “Still Morning in America”:<br />
<blockquote>Where Republicans have most strayed from the Reagan vision has been on controlling federal spending.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong><em>Really?</em></strong>  Twenty years ago – this same rightwing crowd blamed the Reagan deficits on too much spending rather than those Reagan tax cuts.  </p>
<p>While Mr. Brooks wishes to see a “reality” divorced from the facts, I have provided graphs of the unemployment rates during both the Reagan and the Clinton terms.  Given that George W. Bush has been the worst President in at least my lifetime, I can see why folks would long for the good old days.  I especially have sympathy for conservatives given that they were the ones who supported Bush for President some six years ago.  But if one has to praise Ronald Reagan by misrepresenting the historical record- why even bother?</p>

<blockquote>My whole point is to put middle-class entitlements on the table and to cut them substantially. Even though you may disagree with it, that&#8217;s not a free lunch, and it&#8217;s deeply unfair to claim it is. It&#8217;s also designed to protect the really needy. It&#8217;s interesting, though, that the big government left is so hostile to small government conservatives.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hope that I was not hostile when I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/balancing-budget-andrew-sullivans.html">wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>if we decide to cut Social Security benefits in order to privative Social Security, wouldn’t that also imply that we would be reducing payroll contributions? If so, these joint reductions do nothing to reduce the General Fund deficit. Of course, we could cut benefits and keep payroll contributions at their current levels, which should be seen as a backdoor employment tax increase.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me make this simple for Mr. Sullivan.  Some of us on the left realize that middle-class workers want a government run defined benefits program, which is why we on the left applauded the 1983 Social Security commission appointed by Ronald Reagan.  This program raised payroll contributions in order to finance our Social Security benefits.  If conservatives like Robert Barro wish to reverse this and give back our payroll contributions and scrap the Social Security program, we on the left might disagree but we applaud the intellectual honesty of Dr. Barro for saying there is no free lunch.  WHICH MEANS (just in case Mr. Sullivan has not yet figured this out) that this joint reduction in benefits and payroll taxes will not reduce the General Fund deficit by a single penny.</p>
<p>Now if Mr. Sullivan wants to retain those high payroll taxes and slash Social Security benefits, could he bother to have the intellectual integrity to realize that his proposal represents a huge backdoor employment tax increase.  Or am I asking too much?  Maybe he has not figured out the simple point.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_comment/darda200603240746.asp">Michael Darda</a> tries to convince his readers that taxes have increased but not as quickly as spending:<br />
<blockquote>The latest Treasury data show that tax receipts continued to expand at a rapid 14.1 percent annual pace during the last 12 months through February … Since 2001, federal government spending has risen at a 6.6 percent pace, more than two times the 3.1 percent annual average that prevailed from 1993 to 2000. If federal spending had simply compounded by 3.1 percent per annum since 2001 &#8211; matching the 1993-2000 average &#8211; the fiscal budget would actually have been in surplus by $143 billion in February 2006.</p></blockquote>
<p>AB readers – fire away at this spin! And when you are done &#8211; check out how Darda attacks Rubinomics using Keynesian economics that Darda fails to really grasp.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Forgive me, but I have to put Darda’s spin about higher taxes in a little context.  In 2005, nominal taxes were only 3.6% higher than they were in 2000.  Let’s compare this to a few other percentage increases over the same period:</p>
<p>Nominal GDP: 27.2% (taxes as a share of GDP FELL).<br />GDP deflator: 12.2% (taxes fell in real terms).</p>
<p>Did I mention the fact that the population grew, which implies constant dollar (real) taxes per capita fell rather dramatically.</p>
<p>Since I’m assuming Michael Darda understands the concept real per capita, why would he write such utterly misrepresenting nonsense in the first place?  After all, does he assume that the readers of the National Review are THAT stupid?  I know, I know – we’ve been over this before.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Every month the Commerce Department (in a joint project with the Census Division) releases an estimate of how many new orders US manufacturers have received for durable goods.  Durable goods are all sorts of goods that are intended to last at least 3 years &#8211; things like home appliances, cars, computers, manufacturing equipment, and certain defense industry products.  Trends in the new orders that manufacturers receive for such goods are assumed to be a pretty good indicator of the direction of manufacturing activity in the US over coming months.</p>
<p>The release also details new orders specifically for the durable goods that businesses buy, i.e. capital goods.  Trends in capital goods tell us something slightly different &#8211; when firms (both manufacturing and service-sector firms) are ordering lots of capital goods, that is a good indication that they expect their business to do well in coming months and years.  So the capital goods data can be taken as a possible indicator of overall future economic activity (or at least business expectations thereof), rather than just manufacturing activity.</p>
<p>Both of these series are of interest because they may tell us something about the future, unlike most data series which simply tell us about the past.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.census.gov/indicator/www/m3/">Today&#8217;s report</a> showed an increase in both durable goods orders and capital goods orders in February.  However, this monthly data is notoriously volatile, so what happens in one particular month tells us little.  To get a better idea of what this data tells us we should look at trends over time.  The following chart illustrates.</p>
<p><img src="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/dur_goods.jpg"><br />Note: I&#8217;ve removed the effects of inflation and expressed both series in year 2005 dollars, using the seasonally adjusted producer price index for durable goods.</p>
<p>The chart shows that US manufacturers have seen a nice uptick in their order book over the past year, finally pushing their orders back to the level of the peak of the last economic expansion.  However, much of this activity has been confined to the defense industry, the consumer durables industry, and the aircraft industry.  Excluding those industries we see that the orders for capital goods that all other businesses in the US are placing have only just crept up to 1998 levels.</p>
<p>This is an important part of the story about the US&#8217;s recovery from the last recession.  Business spending has been ususually weak for an economic recovery.  Instead, the recovery has been led by consumer spending and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/keynes-lives.html">government  spending</a>, primarily on defense.  </p>
<p>Now if only we could figure out <em>why</em> most US firms have seemed so reluctant to invest in new capital equipment over the past 5 years.  I&#8217;d also like to know how this squares with the substantial and steady growth in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/expanding-production-expanding_17.html">industrial capacity</a> that we&#8217;ve seen over the same period&#8230;</p>

                                <p>As if <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/03/discretionary-spending-growth.html">on cue</a>, today <a href="http://bartlett.blogs.nytimes.com/?p=11">Bruce Bartlett</a> (from behind the NYTimes pay-only fence) offers a thorough explanation for why he &#8211; unlike almost all other conservatives in the US &#8211; understands the US&#8217;s fiscal predicament:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>The Real Budget Crunchers</strong></p>
<p>Recently, there has been some discussion on the blogs about growth of the federal budget deficit under President Bush and what measures would be necessary to balance the budget without raising taxes. When I thought this matter through a few years ago, I concluded that it was impossible to cut spending enough to avoid a major tax increase. Moreover, I concluded that the magnitude of the tax increase was so great that it could only be achieved by adding a significant new revenue source — a value-added tax, or V.A.T. — to the federal tax system on top of all the other taxes. Today, I would like to walk people through the data sources so that they can draw their own conclusions about what needs to be done and what might be possible.</p>
<p>&#8230;The budget office data show that between 2000 and 2005, the federal budget went from a surplus of 2.4 percent of gross domestic product to a deficit of 2.6 percent. This has resulted from a fall in federal revenues of 3.4 percent of G.D.P. and a rise in spending of 1.7 percent. The fall in revenue resulted almost entirely from a decline in personal income taxes, which have dropped from 10.3 percent of G.D.P. in 2000 to 7.5 percent in 2005. Contrary to popular belief, corporate taxes have actually risen a bit while all other revenues are about the same as a share of G.D.P.</p>
<p>On the spending side, most of the increase — 1.6 percent of gross domestic product — has been for so-called discretionary programs, those requiring annual appropriations&#8230; [and] within the discretionary accounts, most of the increase has been for defense, which has risen by 1 percent of G.D.P. Domestic discretionary programs have risen by 0.4 percent.</p>
<p>Some people will look at these numbers and say that the Bush tax cuts are the principal cause of the rise in the deficit. If we simply repeal the tax cuts, much of the deficit will disappear&#8230; Others will look at the data and say that almost all the increase in spending is due to the “war on terror” and should be excused.  But whether justified or not, the Iraq War is still going to cost a great deal for many years to come.</p>
<p>&#8230;Where I really fault President Bush on the budget is with the Medicare drug benefit, which he rammed through Congress in 2003 and which will raise spending far into the future. According to the 2005 Medicare trustees report, the future unfunded liability for Medicare Part A is 2.5 percent of G.D.P. in perpetuity (page 64). The unfunded liability of Medicare Part B is 2.7 percent of G.D.P. (page 101). And the unfunded liability of Medicare Part D, the drug benefit, is 1.9 percent of G.D.P. (page 112). In other words, we would need to increase taxes by 7.1 percent of G.D.P. immediately and forever just to pay for all the Medicare benefits that have been promised — an amount close to what is now raised by the individual income tax.</p>
<p>By the way, the 2005 Social Security trustees report says that the unfunded liability of that program, which Mr. Bush told us over and over again was in dire need of a fix last year, has an unfunded liability of just 1.2 percent of G.D.P. (page 60) — virtually nothing compared to Medicare’s problems. This is especially so when one considers that pension obligations can be estimated very accurately, while those for health care spending are very difficult to predict because of changes in technology and other factors.</p>
<p>In short, President Bush got everything backwards. He made the Medicare problem far worse when he should have been making every possible effort to improve its finances. Then he wasted an enormous amount of energy on Social Security reform when that program’s financial problems are a fraction of Medicare’s. And by failing to fix Social Security, he has still left this as a problem for a future president to deal with.</p>
<p>&#8230;What all these studies show is the same order of magnitude. Federal spending as a share of gross domestic product is going to rise by about 10 percentage points of G.D.P. over the next generation — the equivalent of $1.2 trillion per year in today’s economy — simply because of the aging of society, even if no new government programs are enacted. To prevent [this] just through cutting spending would require the abolition of every single thing the government does other than Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid — including the entire Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not going to happen. And given the political clout of the elderly — who vote in the highest percentages of any age group in society — it seems unrealistic to me that significant savings can be achieved by cutting programs that benefit them. Although some relatively modest program changes, like raising the retirement age, could save large sums over time, such changes require long phase-in periods to allow people to adjust. Thus we are still left with a huge increase in spending as a share of the economy for the foreseeable future. In a future post, I will explain why I think a value added tax is the best way to deal with this reality.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can&#8217;t really find anything in Bruce&#8217;s post to argue with&#8230;</p>
