                                <p>The abstract of <em>Job Flows and the Recent Business Cycle: Not All &#8216;Recoveries&#8217; Are Created Equal</em> by <a href="http://www.bls.gov/ore/abstract/ec/ec060030.htm">R. Jason Faberman</a> reads:<br />
<blockquote>The last two economic downturns are notable for their slow labor market recoveries. Yet, the behavior of their underlying gross job flows is quite different. The 1990-92 period had a relatively slow decline in job destruction, while the 2001-03 period had a large, persistent decline in job creation that occurs across most industries. The dynamics of the latter period run counter to the conventional wisdom that large movements in job destruction drive business cycles. Evidence spanning the entire postwar period suggests that job creation is at a historic low, and that its recent patterns are part of decades-long decline in the magnitude and volatility of job reallocation.</p></blockquote>
<p>As the <a href="http://neweconomist.blogs.com/new_economist/2006/03/bls_job_creatio.html">New Economist</a> notes “job creation is at a historic low”.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Yesterday I heard a story on NPR&#8217;s <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5261429"><em>Morning Edition</em></a> that set me to wondering.  The central point of the story was that newspapers (particularly local papers) are facing an increasingly difficult time, because their ad revenues are declining as more people get their news from the internet instead of from a traditional newspaper.  Newspapers can make up some of the lost revenue by placing ads on their websites, but the replacement rate is only about 1/3, according to the story.  The worry is thus that local papers will have to shrink as their ad revenues shrink, and that the news coverage in the US will therefore diminish.</p>
<p>What I wonder about is this: why is the replacement rate so low?  The reason posited by the NPR story makes no sense to me.  They said that online ad revenue is smaller than print ad revenue because online ads are more specifically targeted to <em>interested</em> readers only.  That&#8217;s not a satisfactory explanation, however, because advertisers only care about the number of <em>interested</em> people who see their ads, not the number of total people.  Put another way, I think that if people are just shifting to reading the paper online, newspapers could still reap the same ad revenue, since they still have the same number of eyeballs looking at their ads as before, just in a different format.</p>
<p>So there must be something else going on.  People must be getting their news from entirely different sources, rather than their local newspaper in print or online form.  My guess is that lots of people still get their news from online newspapers, but that increasingly people visit the big national newspapers instead of their local paper.  What we should see, therefore, is a few big papers reaping the ad revenue from their online editions that used to go to lots of local papers&#8217; print editions.</p>
<p>If my hypothesis is correct, then the overall ad revenue earned by the newspaper industry nationally should not be falling &#8211; just its distribution between papers.  The result may eventually be a few huge papers, and a fall in the number and size of local papers.  The overall resources devoted to the coverage of national and international news should remain the same (or get even larger); the resources devoted to local news coverage should fall.</p>
<p>Some data on this would be great.  Unfortunately, a quick web search (which is all that I had time for this morning) didn&#8217;t yield any easy time-series data sources on advertising revenue by medium or by newspaper.  But it would be interesting to see&#8230; because I think that the pattern of shifting ad revenues would tell us a lot about changes in how people get their news. </p>

<blockquote>What seemingly is missed every time the anti-trust crowd gets in a froth over a proposed merger is the nature of profits. If anything, consumers should hope that companies succeed in achieving monopoly profits. Large profits by definition speak to an unmet market need that is being met. More importantly, large profits attract competition. It can even be argued that if companies do not achieve monopoly gains, they’re engaging in activity that is not important to consumers and that will not attract competition. </p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Thoma replies:<br />
<blockquote>Yeah, wheat farming is pretty unimportant. I&#8217;ll be so much better off if someone can monopolize that industry and raise the price of bread. Tamny confuses prices as a short-run signal to direct resource flows and equilibrium prices at inefficient levels due to market power. Yes, profits and losses are necessary in the short-run to encourage entry and exit. But monopoly profits that persist through time in the long-run equilibrium are not in the economy&#8217;s best interest.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wheat is an important product but I doubt we are about to see a wheat cartel.  There is a petroleum cartel but U.S. anti-trust laws can’t change that.  So let’s focus on the industries that Mr. Tamny wrote about – personal computers and telecommunications.  Since Tamny concedes what his NRO colleagues refuse to – that being that Microsoft has a virtual monopoly in terms of PC operating systems – I guess he thinks personal computers are not important.  And if he believes that telecommunication is important – then why is he endorsing a return to an era some 25 years ago when AT&#038;T had a monopoly?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>In the news today, there is new data about US borrowing from abroad, and retail spending at home.  First the borrowing:<br />
<blockquote><strong>U.S. current account widens to record</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B706EBC3A-757B-417C-B716-DFA02D3AB138%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; The U.S. current account deficit widened by 21.3% to a record $224.9 billion in the fourth quarter, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday. The deficit amounted to 7.0% of the nation&#8217;s gross domestic product, also a record. Read full government report. For all of 2005, the current account deficit grew to a record $804.9 billion, totaling a record 6.4% of GDP. It&#8217;s the ninth annual record in the past ten years. </p></blockquote>
<p>And now the spending:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Retail sales fall 1.3% in Feb.</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7B4C386ABC-9D22-42A6-AAD0-56A1AD20721C%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; U.S. retail sales fell 1.3% in February, the biggest decline in six months, dragged down by weak auto sales, the Commerce Department estimated Tuesday. Excluding autos, retail sales decreased 0.4%, the biggest drop since April 2004.  Excluding both autos and gas, retail sales decreased 0.3%. There were steep declines in furniture and clothing stores and lesser drops in gasoline and restaurants.</p>
<p>Economists were not expecting such a large decline in retail sales. The average forecast in a MarketWatch survey called for a 0.8% decline. Excluding autos, sales were expected to fall 0.4%. </p></blockquote>
<p>Congratulations are due to <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/setser/">Brad Setser</a>, who correctly predicted a CA deficit of $800+ billion last summer some time, if I&#8217;m not mistaken.</p>
<p>The retail sales data, being monthly, doesn&#8217;t really tell us much by itself.  However, it is one more (rather dark-hued) grain of sand to add to our mandala depicting where the economy is going&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Paul Krugman and Robin Wells review three books on the US health care system and provide their suggestions in <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/articles/18802">&#8220;The Health Care Crisis and What to Do About It&#8221;</a>  From their conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>Health policy experts know a lot more about the economics of health care now than they did when Bill Clinton tried to remake the US health care system. And there&#8217;s overwhelming evidence that the United States could get better health care at lower cost if we were willing to put that knowledge into practice. But the political obstacles remain daunting.</p>
<p>A mere shift of power from Republicans to Democrats would not, in itself, be enough to give us sensible health care reform. While Democrats would have written a less perverse drug bill, it&#8217;s not clear that they are ready to embrace a single-payer system. Even liberal economists and scholars at progressive think tanks tend to shy away from proposing a straightforward system of national health insurance. Instead, they propose fairly complex compromise plans. &#8230; the main reason for not proposing single-payer is political fear: reformers believe that private insurers are too powerful to cut out of the loop, and that a single-payer plan would be too easily demonized by business and political propagandists as &#8220;big government.&#8221; </p>
<p>These are the same political calculations that led Bill Clinton to reject a single-payer system in 1993, even though his advisers believed that a single-payer system would be the least expensive way to provide universal coverage. Instead, he proposed a complex plan designed to preserve a role for private health insurers. But the plan backfired. The insurers opposed it anyway, most famously with their &#8220;Harry and Louise&#8221; ads. And the plan&#8217;s complexity left the public baffled. </p>
<p>We believe that the compromise plans being proposed by the cautious reformers would run into the same political problems, and that it would be politically smarter as well as economically superior to go for broke: to propose a straightforward single-payer system, and try to sell voters on the huge advantages such a system would bring. But this would mean taking on the drug and insurance companies rather than trying to co-opt them, and even progressive policy wonks, let alone Democratic politicians, still seem too timid to do that.</p>
<p>So what will really happen to American health care? Many people in this field believe that in the end America will end up with national health insurance, and perhaps with a lot of direct government provision of health care, simply because nothing else works. But things may have to get much worse before reality can break through the combination of powerful interest groups and free-market ideology.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Feingold is bad on fiscal policy (he&#8217;s a budget balancer)</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Max does not wish a return to Rubinomics, but I do.  The main point of Max’s post is to endorse the Censure resolution.  This one is a no-brainer and if any Democratic Senator lacks the spine to support Feingold &#8211; that Senator is not qualified to be President in my opinion.  </p>
<p>Then again – Senator Warner attacked Feingold’s resolution as a “political stunt”.  Standing on principles is a political stunt?  Has there ever been more evidence that the GOP dominated Senate has turned itself into a rubber stamp for Karl Rove?</p>

<blockquote>It’s always amazing to listen to conventional demand-side economic pundits and mainstream reporters who try as hard as they can to minimize the excellent performance of the American economy ever since lower marginal tax-rate incentives were put into place almost two-and-a-half years ago … Apart from the inherent resiliency of our free-market capitalist economy, the fact remains that tax-induced capital cost reduction and resulting higher investment returns have boosted investment, healed business woes, and created employment growth near 2 million new jobs a year (and nearly 5 million since the middle of 2003 when the Bush tax cuts were implemented)&#8230; Of course, you can’t please the worrywarts. Yesterday they complained that wages weren’t rising; today they’re bellyaching that wage growth is too fast and that the Fed is going to have to tighten monetary policy much more in order to ward off cost-push inflation. This is more bogus Phillips-curve argument. But growth does not cause inflation. Fortunately, new Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke rebutted the Phillips-curve view in a recent speech at Princeton. Bernanke correctly argued that low inflation promotes economic growth and that strong economic growth is something to be desired, not shunned. The Fed chair cited Milton Friedman’s argument of nearly fifty years ago that inflation is a monetary phenomenon and not a function of too many people working or prospering &#8230; Reagan economic guru Art Laffer taught us thirty years ago that lower tax rates ignite economic growth. Now, the Laffer curve is tracking a business-led expansion that is throwing off record budget revenues while corporate profits are soaring. Profits are the mother’s milk of business, the economy, and stocks, and are laying the foundation for even more hefty job gains &#8230; In the months ahead, Ben Bernanke will follow the anti-inflation thinking of Milton Friedman. President Bush will continue to embrace the pro-growth Laffer curve. And the anti-worker Phillips curve will be pushed into the dustbin of history. In other words, economic growth principles will keep American capitalism on the prosperity path.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to begin addressing the collection of contradictory BS?  First of all, Bernanke did not endorse Kudlow’s brand of free lunch bologna.  In fact, <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/03/the_latest_empl.html">James Hamilton</a> has very clearly explained why the Bernanke FED is running tight money – to offset the unwise fiscal stimulus that Kudlow advocates.  As Dr. Hamilton notes – the result will be a higher cost of capital and less investment for long-term growth.  </p>
<p>Now Kudlow wants you to believe that we have repealed the full employment constraint.  If he actually believes that, he should re-read Bernanke’s speech:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Notably, during the 1960s and early 1970s, some policymakers appeared to believe that price stability and high employment were substitutes, not complements. Specifically, some influential voices of the time argued that, by accepting higher inflation, policymakers could bring about a permanently lower rate of unemployment … The idea of the permanent tradeoff did not go unchallenged, however. In 1967, economists Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps independently produced influential critiques of this view. Their key contribution was to observe that, if inflation expectations react to changes in actual inflation in an economically reasonable way, then any tradeoff between inflation and unemployment would be short-lived at best … Over a short period, then, higher inflation might bring lower unemployment, consistent with the empirical results found by Phillips.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me correct a misrepresentation of the advice that President Johnson was receiving in the latter part of 1965.  His Keynesian advisors sensed that the combination of Vietnam War spending, the Great Society spending, and the extra consumption demand from the 1964 tax cut would lead to a Faustian choice – either have the FED raise interest rate as they did during the 1966 Credit Crunch or let inflation accelerate – which alas happened when the FED lost its political will to follow the advice of these Keynesian economists.  Kudlow’s mentor – Art Laffer – is a mentee of Norman Ture who in 1966 was saying we did not need fiscal restraint.  Ture was wrong as in Kudlow.  And yet Kudlow has the gall to blame the Keynesian advisors who gave the President the correct advice?  Pathetic!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/3-8-06tax.htm">Richard Kogan and Aviva Aron-Dine</a> recently put forth <em>CLAIM THAT TAX CUTS “PAY FOR THEMSELVES” IS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE: Data Show No “Free Lunch” Here</em>:<br />
<blockquote>In recent statements, the President, the Vice President, and key Congressional leaders have asserted that the increase in revenues in 2005 proves that tax cuts “pay for themselves.”   In other words, the economy expands so much as a result of tax cuts that it produces the same level of revenue as it would have without the tax cuts … In fact, however, the evidence tells a very different story:  the tax cuts have not paid for themselves, recent economic growth and revenue growth have not been particularly strong, and revenues remain lower than had been predicted before the tax cuts were enacted. </p></blockquote>
<p>Angrybear readers are likely very aware of the basic case made by this paper, but the authors do a very nice job of presenting the evidence.  </p>
<p>(Hat tip to AB reader thebhc)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2006/03/the_latest_empl.html">James Hamilton</a> has more as he explores two of the usual supply-side claims followed by this comment on the aggregate demand angle:<br />
<blockquote>We are then left then with the third argument, which is that the budget deficits may be serving to stimulate aggregate demand. Such a claim would in my opinion be accurate. However, the question is whether stimulating consumption spending is a desirable policy goal at this point in the business cycle. I believe that our big concerns at the moment should be reducing the trade deficit and increasing national saving, both of which goals are undermined by a big federal deficit. And it surely makes no sense for Congress to be doing its best to stimulate aggregate demand while the Federal Reserve is determined to reduce aggregate demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem that 2006 will resemble the 1966 credit crunch when fiscal stimulus was matched by monetary restraint.  On the two supply-side claims, Dr. Hamilton simply notes that labor force participation has declined since 2000 and the ratio of personal savings as a percent of GDP is quite low.</p>

<p>Sully’s response was:<br />

<p>I have to wonder if Andrew Sullivan even remotely understands the fiscal situation.  Yes, spending as a share of GDP has risen – SLIGHTLY.  The main reason for the shift from the Clinton era of fiscal responsibility to the current situation with massive budget deficits, however, is the tax cuts that Mr. Sullivan still supports.  Now if he has some magic wand for reducing spending, I’d like to hear it.  If the magic wand is to eliminate Social Security benefits but still impose payroll taxes – I’d call that a backdoor employment tax increase.  Or might the magic wand be a massive cut in defense spending, which would mean that Sullivan is not serious about national security.  If Andrew Sullivan is serious about fiscal responsibility, how can he still support tax cuts when neither he nor any conservative that I know of has anything remotely close to $600 billion per year in spending cuts?</p>
