                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTQ3OTUyNmU2N2U2M2MwNDQ3MGZjODljMWYwMjY5ZjI=">Byron York</a> makes the following phony distinction:<br />
<blockquote>A pattern is emerging in pre-trial arguments in the perjury and obstruction of justice case against former Cheney chief of staff Lewis Libby. That pattern is the recurring conflict between the Little Case and the Big Case. The Little Case is the narrow, tightly defined charge that Libby lied to prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald&#8217;s grand jury. For example, did Libby lie when he testified that NBC&#8217;s Tim Russert &#8220;said to me, did you know that Ambassador Wilson&#8217;s wife…works at the CIA? And I said, no, I don&#8217;t know that&#8221;? Did Libby lie when he testified that, when speaking to journalists about the information that Valerie Plame Wilson worked at the CIA, &#8220;I was very clear to say reporters are telling us that because in my mind I still didn&#8217;t know it as a fact&#8221;? If Fitzgerald had his way, that is all the case would be about. At every hearing, and in every court filing, he has argued that the case is simply a matter of a few specific false statements allegedly made by Libby. Nothing else matters &#8211; just the Little Case.</p></blockquote>
<p>After all, no one at the National Review ever made a big deal about Clinton lying about his sex life – right?  But what Mr. York fails to admit is that Libby did more than simply lie.  He obstructed the investigation of the “Big Case”.  </p>
<p>Then again – Mr. York has also said it was no big deal that Robert Novak told the world that Valerie Plame was a CIA agent since Mr. York and his NRO colleagues have repeatedly claimed that was common knowledge before July 2003.  Of course, these NRO folks lie when they say that, but then dishonesty for them is no big deal.</p>

                                <p>First off, apologies to everyone for my extended hiatus.  It&#8217;s been almost four weeks since I&#8217;ve posted, which is the longest stretch that I&#8217;ve been missing since I starting writing on Angry Bear nearly three years ago.  But the past few weeks have been a pretty busy time for me in more than the usual sense, due to lots of major changes in my personal life (mostly having to do with moving, buying a house, and changing jobs).  Tons of credit and kudos go to PGL for keeping the ship sailing almost single-handedly while I was out of action.  (Hmmm&#8230; let&#8217;s see how many metaphors I can mix in one post&#8230;)</p>
<p>The next few weeks also promise to be pretty filled with things that will try to keep me on the sidelines, but even if I can&#8217;t get back to my usual rate of output I do plan on writing at least a little, starting today&#8230;</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=13885">Human Events</a> lists its top ten.   I hate to agree with these rightwing zealots but farm subsidies and earmarking should make this list.  And I’ll give credit to Human Events for placing some of the blame on the Republican Party.  #3 on their lists confuses income tax withholding with income tax rates – and perhaps these fellows should realize that every dollar the government spends has to be collected in taxes eventually from some source.  McCain-Feingold and funding of contraceptives as an alternative to more unplanned pregnancies, which might end up in abortion are bad policies???  Medicare, Medicaid, Affirmative Action, and the Davis-Bacon Act are other areas where I would take exception to their list.</p>
<p><strong>But there #1 bad government program is – surprise, surprise – Social Security!</strong> And what is wrong with a publicly run defined benefits program?</p>
<blockquote><p>The program has socialized the retirement of Americans, making most seniors financially dependent on payments that the federal government may alter, decrease or even cancel … Social Security collected $657.7 billion in taxes in 2004 and paid out $501.6 billion in benefits. Congress spent every penny of the $156.1-billion Social Security surplus on non-Social Security items.</p></blockquote>
<p>I see – the lack of fiscal discipline from the Republican Congress and President Bush is taking the funds that are supposed to be dedicated to the retirement of working class Americans and giving them to high income individuals in the form of income tax reductions.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/deficit_hawks_w.html">Brad DeLong</a> treats us to the latest from <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/5-1-06socsec.htm">Jason Furman and Robert Greenstein</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Anyone concerned about Social Security’s long-term impact on the federal budget ought to be even more concerned about the long-term fiscal impact of extending the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.  If made permanent, the tax cuts will cost nearly three times as much, over the next 75 years, as the 75-year deficit in Social Security</p></blockquote>
<p>Or as Brad says:<br />
<blockquote>Anyone who claims to be a &#8220;deficit hawk&#8221; who favors extending Bush&#8217;s tax cuts is not a deficit hawk, but a deficit turkey.</p></blockquote>
<p>Speaking of turkeys, check out the latest spin from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/08/AR2006050801561.html">Allan Sloan</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Cash is what matters, because Social Security&#8217;s multitrillion-dollar trust fund, consisting of IOUs from the U.S. Treasury, won&#8217;t help the federal government cover shortfalls when the program begins taking in less than it spends. The shortfalls are projected to start at about $11 billion in 2017.</p></blockquote>
<p>By 2017, benefit payments may start to exceed payroll contributions – but guess what, reserves will continue to rise for a few more years. <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/05/post-columnist-advocates-default-on.html">Dean Baker</a> comments:<br />
<blockquote>Washington Post columnist Allan Sloan called for defaulting on the U.S. national debt, or at least a portion of it … Mr. Sloan probably would object to describing his column as a call for default on the national debt, but this in fact exactly what it is. In the column, he implicitly derides the legitimacy of the bonds held by Social Security by calling them IOUs. Of course all bonds are IOUs, but they are never described this way in normal discussions.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a final note, during yesterday’s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/progressive-tax-cut-what-tax-cut.html">progressivity debate</a>, a 2004 discussion of Social Security by <a href="http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=121004A">Arnold Kling</a> was mentioned:<br />
<blockquote>For the Left, the Achilles heel of Social Security is the regressive payroll tax that is used to fund it. Social Security taxes soak up a much larger share of the income of the average worker than of the affluent. Income taxes, on the other hand, have become increasingly progressive.</p></blockquote>
<p>This discussion makes sense ONLY IF one ignores the distribution of benefits across income groups.  While I might be tempted to suggest that this oped ranks as one of Arnold’s worst, maybe he was forecasting that Allan Sloan’s suggestion might become reality.  </p>
<p>As far as the Social Security program – with modest adjustments to the benefit structure to be paid to future retirees – this program can be solvent.  But then I’m assuming that we can prevent Allan Sloan, the Human Events, and Bush wing of the Republican Party from stealing the Trust Fund reserves to pay for goodies for the rich paid for by our payroll contributions.  And yes – that is a very big assumption!</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Some of the more informed AB readers want me to find something to rebut the spin from JoshK who claims that giving people their money back allows them to get a better return than they would get from putting their money in the publicly run defined benefits program known as Social Security.  I have often mentioned Robert Barro’s July 2000 Business Week op-ed that said this free lunch proposition was bunk and more recently I linked to another conservative economist who agree with Barro – that being <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110006321">Gary Becker</a>:<br />
<blockquote>It is true, as some critics observe, that there is no magical gain in privatizing Social Security, since all systems have to provide incomes for retired persons &#8230; Contrary to the Bush position, however, I do not believe that the main advantage of a private-account system is that individuals can get a higher return on their old-age savings by investing in stocks. There are no freebies from such investments since the higher return on stocks is related to their greater risk and other trade-offs between stocks and different assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have made this point in several posts and this point has been made by a number of economists – both conservative and liberal.  Yet – George W. Bush still argues there must be some free lunch, so why should we be surprised that his loyal followers think the same thing?</p>

                                <p>This afternoon I received an email from the National Republican Senatorial Committee.  What really stood out is that the NRSC has only one talking point: Vote GOP or Bush might be impeached!  An excerpt:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The Washington Post reported this week that House and Senate Democrats are salivating over the possibility of convening hearings on everything from the War in Iraq to the National Security Agency&#8217;s terrorist surveillance program.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  I am still a registered Republican, and most Republicans I&#8217;ve spoken with are upset about Bush&#8217;s fiscal policies, his handling of the War in Iraq and the erosion of their civil liberties.  This email seems intended to urge Republicans to vote Democrat in 2006.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;They want nothing more than to create a three-ring political circus they know will get favorable coverage from the liberal media so that they can discredit, and then undo the Bush tax cuts and other important elements of the Bush agenda.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>  Ignoring the &#8220;liberal media&#8221; canard, I support undoing most of the Bush tax cuts as a first step in restoring fiscal responsibility.   Also I&#8217;m not sure of what the &#8220;other important elements of the Bush agenda&#8221; are &#8211; and apparently the NRSC couldn&#8217;t think of anything either!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unpopular President Bush&#8217;s approval ratings have sunk to new lows in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/09/washington/09cnd-poll.html">New York Times/CBS News Poll</a>.  It looks like most Americans are ready for change. I know I am.</p>
<p>Best to all, CR  <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">Calculated Risk</a></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE2:</strong> Meyerson at the WaPo picks up the same theme: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/09/AR2006050901504.html">The GOP&#8217;s Bankruptcy of Ideas</a><br />
<blockquote>The emerging Republican game plan for 2006 is, at bottom, a tautology: If the Democrats retake Congress it will mean, well, that the Democrats retake Congress. (Cue lightning bolt and ominous clap of thunder.) Karl Rove and his minions have plumb run out of issues to campaign on.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>UPDATE: </strong>Here is the entire email:<br />
<blockquote>I want to share with you what I believe to be one of the dangers of a Democrat victory this November.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s becoming clear that if the liberal Democrat leadership takes control of Congress, they will embark on a destructive agenda of politically motivated &#8220;investigations&#8221; of President Bush and his administration. </p>
<p>The Washington Post reported this week that House and Senate Democrats are salivating over the possibility of convening hearings on everything from the War in Iraq to the National Security Agency&#8217;s terrorist surveillance program. </p>
<p>They want nothing more than to create a three-ring political circus they know will get favorable coverage from the liberal media so that they can discredit, and then undo the Bush tax cuts and other important elements of the Bush agenda. </p>
<p>And it&#8217;s even likely that Democrats &#8211; should they take over the House and Senate &#8211; will try to impeach President Bush. </p>
<p>Senator Russ Feingold has a measure pending on the Senate floor that would &#8220;censure&#8221; the President over his efforts to stop terrorism.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago on a national news program, Senator Durbin of Illinois, the second most powerful Democrat leader in the Senate, refused to rule out the eventual impeachment of President Bush.</p>
<p>The likely Democrat Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee (where impeachment begins), has already made it clear that he supports such action. Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) has already sponsored a resolution calling for an investigation with the clear aim of initiating impeachment proceedings against President Bush. Already, 35 Democrats plus Senate candidate Bernie Sanders (I-VT) have signed on as cosponsors. </p>
<p>And this week on Meet The Press, House Democrat Leader Nancy Pelosi (who will likely become Speaker if Democrats take control of the House) said of the possibility of impeachment: &#8220;you never know where the facts take you.&#8221; </p>
<p>Well, I think it&#8217;s pretty clear where the Democrats will take us. </p>
<p>If Democrats control the House and Senate, there will be a series of irresponsible hearings, and President Bush will be impeached. That&#8217;s not the kind of &#8220;leadership&#8221; this country needs, and that&#8217;s one of the reasons we need your help to prevent Democrats from taking control of the Senate.</p>
<p>The Senate is our last line of defense against the ultra-liberal coalition of fringe groups and their friends in Congress. We cannot allow them to hijack the government and use it as a vehicle for their angry, revenge politics. <a href="http://www.gopsenators.com/newsdesk/article.aspx?ID=2268">Click here to read the Washington Post article I referred to</a>, which spells out exactly what Democrats are preparing to do if they take control of Congress. </p>
<p>I hope you&#8217;ll forward this article to your friends, and spread the word about how important this election is. You can also learn more about the NRSC here and how to get involved the 2006 Senate races by clicking here.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<blockquote>Yet the letter comes amid renewed calls by some, including former national security adviser Samuel Berger and Senator Chuck Hagel (R-NE), to reengage directly with Iran&#8217;s government to defuse the crisis by diplomatic means. &#8220;The continued unwillingness of the U.S. to engage Iran will make other [UN Security Council] states hesitate to support, and possibly oppose&#8221; stricter actions like sanctions, Hagel wrote in the Financial Times. </p></blockquote>

<p>Alas, the main reason for Lionel’s post has to do with President Bush ignoring President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s letter for a diplomatic resolution to our differences.  As <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran9may09,0,3215039.story?coll=la-home-headlines">Maggie Farley and Paul Richter</a> note:<br />
<blockquote>Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sent an unexpected letter to President Bush on Monday, in what was seen as an overture for direct talks about Tehran&#8217;s nuclear program, but U.S. officials dismissed the missive as an eleventh-hour ploy to forestall punitive action by the United Nations &#8230; Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told the Associated Press that the letter did not contain serious proposals on the disputed nuclear program, but covered history, philosophy and religion over 17 or 18 pages.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>A ploy?</strong>  Get ready folks – the neocons running our military seem to want a war with Iran.  After all, Karl Rove has to do something to win the 2006 elections.  I just hope the grownups in the GOP join Senator Hagel in speaking out.</p>

<blockquote>The growth of consumption plus investment (core GDP) advanced at a torrid 6.2 percent annual rate during the first quarter in real terms while nominal core GDP galloped at a 9.5 percent annual rate, the best showing since the first quarter of 2000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though Darda later worries about inflation – he decides to tout the growth in nominal “core GDP”.  As far as his real core GDP, I have several questions.  The first is how did he come up with 6.2% as when I sum consumption and investment (total including inventory accumulation), it seems to have grown by a 5.6% annual rate during 2006QI.  More fundamentally, why would he and Kudlow want to exclude net exports from their calculations?  I would also challenge the notion that government purchases should be excluded from these calculations, but notice something.  Real government purchases rose by just under a 4% annual rate.</p>
<p>So what is really going on here?  Darda writes:<br />
<blockquote>Real exports of goods and services advanced at a 12.1 percent annual rate during the first three months of the year after a 5.1 percent increase during the fourth quarter. This was the fastest quarterly rate of increase since the last quarter of 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>Darda omits the fact that imports grew more than exports.  So the real reason Darda and Kudlow omit net exports from core GDP is that they don’t want to admit to their readers that the current account deficit has grown.</p>

<p>The graph shows private spending (consumption + investment + net exports) as a share of GDP from 2000QI to 2006QI.  The suggestion from Darda and Kudlow that private spending growth exceeded overall growth is both false and also contradictory to the claim of certain small government conservatives that Bush has somehow been a liberal.  The decline in the private spending/GDP ratio from around 82.5% in 2000 to 81% today is simply the flip side of the increase in government purchases, which were running about 17.5% of GDP in 2000 and are now up to 19%.  As Kudlow once tried to argue – Bush has not cut government spending “Reagan style”.  Then again – neither did President Reagan.  Of course in the 1980’s, some conservatives blamed the Reagan deficits on exploding government spending, while some conservatives today claim Reagan succeeded in small government conservatism.  Of course, anyone would bothers to review the historical record realizes that government spending as a share of GDP neither rose nor fell appreciably in the 1980’s either.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.janegalt.net/blog/archives/005766.html">Jane Galt</a> takes <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/05/framing-and-progressivity.html">Greg Mankiw</a> to school on fiscal policy:<br />
<blockquote>There are four ways that I can think of for the US to deal with its debt burden: 1) Raise taxes to pay it off. </p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, she started off praising Dr. Mankiw’s discussion of an op-ed from <a href="http://public.wsj.com/marketing/openhouse/welcome.html?oreq=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB114705083956846285.html%3Fmod=opinion_main_commentaries">Edward Lazear and Katherine Baicker</a> where it was claimed:<br />
<blockquote>The president&#8217;s tax cuts have made the tax code more progressive</p></blockquote>
<p>Jane’s point was made by <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/6-2-04tax.htm">William G. Gale, Peter R. Orszag, and Isaac Shapiro</a> who wrote:<br />
<blockquote>Popular discussions about the advisability of recent tax cuts have frequently ignored a simple truism:  someone, somewhere, at some time will have to pay for them.  The payment may be in the form of increases in other taxes, reductions in government programs, or some combination of the two; the payment may occur now or later; it may be transparent or hidden.  But iron laws of arithmetic and fiscal solvency tell us that the payment has to occur.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jane continued:<br />
<blockquote>This will be a burden on America&#8217;s relatively poorer members only to the extent that the tax burden falls on them. But while overall withholdings are only very mildly progressive in America (thanks to Social Security payments), income tax is extremely progressive; the effective federal tax burden on someone like Arnold Schwarzenegger is roughly 30%, while a median-income family of four pays less than 8% of its income to the federal tax</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr Gale et al., however, wrote:<br />
<blockquote>The tax cuts are often portrayed by their supporters as painless and simply “giving people their money back.”  But the numbers presented above indicate that the substantial majority of American households ultimately will be made worse off by the tax cuts, because the tax cuts ultimately will have to be financed.  Different methods of financing would generate variation in the particular results, but this basic finding that most households end up being worse off is likely to continue to hold unless a significant portion of the tax cuts themselves are repealed.  The reason is that the tax cuts scale back (or even eliminate) many of the most progressive elements of the federal tax system, including the estate tax, the taxation of capital gains and dividends, the top income tax rates, and the phase-outs of certain exemptions and deductions for households with high incomes.  It is unlikely that any method of financing those changes, other than repeal, will be as progressive as the tax provisions that have been scaled back.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Dr. Gale et al. presented their assumptions and detailed reasoning, we will have to wait Jane’s more detailed analysis.</p>

<blockquote>Notwithstanding the fact that the Bush administration has violated every tenet of this strain of conservatism for the last five years, conservatives will not be permitted to distance themselves from this administration &#8212; as they are transparently and pitifully trying to do now that Bush&#8217;s presidency is failed and is dying a rapid death (see e.g., this characteristically dishonest attempt by Jonah Goldberg to characterize the two failed Republican Presidents &#8211; Nixon and Bush &#8211; as &#8220;liberals&#8221; in order to imply that their failure is not a failure of conservatives; funny how we never heard any of that when The Commander had approval ratings in the 60s). With rare and noble exception, conservatives did not repudiate Bush until very recently. To the contrary, they have vigorously supported and claimed him (while he was popular), and he is their creation. They are and should be stuck with him.</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice in particular this passage from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWU2NTMzOWUzMzNhMmZjYzU2YmUzY2JmYmYzOTU5Zjg=">Jonah Goldberg</a>: <br />
<blockquote>I could argue that Nixon&#8217;s amoral foreign policy is today alive and well in many corners of the Left, but that&#8217;s a distraction from my central point. Bush is certainly to the right of Nixon on many issues. But at the philosophical level, he shares the Nixonians&#8217; supreme confidence in the power of the state. Bush rejects limited government and many of the philosophical assumptions that underlie that position. He favors instead strong government.</p></blockquote>
<p>While it would be tempting to slam Mr. Goldberg for that cheap shot at liberals where he suggests we are Nixonian, let me agree with his assertion that Bush is a lot like Nixon in advocating the supremacy of the Executive Branch even so far as to violate with impunity the civil rights of citizens and to trash the career of a CIA agent simply for partisan purposes.  Oh wait, the National Review defends this White House in PlameGate.  </p>
<p>But let me thank certain Republican leaders for having the same concern with the appointment of General Hayden to head the CIA as I do.  But guess what – the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MjJlY2ZhNzZkNThhODg0YTVjNTk0MzkxMWU5ZDQ2YjE=">National Review</a> is supporting this nomination:<br />
<blockquote>The reasons for Porter Goss’s abrupt departure as CIA director are shrouded in mystery. But its effect is not. It gives the impression that there has been a coup by the CIA insiders who have waged a covert policy war against the Bush administration for five years. The White House must act quickly to correct the impression that the renegades have won. The CIA is supposed to work for the president.</p></blockquote>
<p>The NRO editors have the gall to suggest that the CIA has been working for the Democratic Party.  When they say the CIA is supposed to work for the President – I guess they envision a CIA on par with their own partisan hackery.  Too bad they cannot understand that some of us want a CIA to work for the American people.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/node/29634">Matthew Yglesias</a> has more, but neither he nor I went after this:<br />
<blockquote>When the administration posed questions in 2002 about intelligence reports that Saddam Hussein had sought uranium yellowcake (a potential nuclear precursor) in Niger, Valerie Plame Wilson, a CIA analyst who thought these reports were “crazy,” helped arrange to have her husband, former ambassador Joseph Wilson, sent on a CIA fact-finding mission. Though the assignment was classified, the CIA permitted Wilson to author a New York Times op-ed ripping the administration for purportedly misstating intelligence in the run-up to the war and suggesting—disingenuously, it turned out—that Joseph Wilson had found no evidence that Iraq had sought uranium from Niger. A coterie of current and former agency officers demanded the prosecution of administration officials when Plame’s status as a CIA employee—a matter that appears to have been widely known, and whose leak caused no damage to national security—was mentioned in the media.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hopefully, <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/">FDL</a> will rip into these liars at the National Review!</p>

                                <p>While the folks over at the National Review have nothing but praise for a book written by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1596980044/ref=ase_httpwwwandrec-20/102-8664038-4105735?n=283155&#038;tagActionCode=httpwwwandrec-20">RameshPonnuru</a>, <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/05/ramesh_coulter_.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> (to his credit) has been criticizing what appears to be a partisan cheap shot.  <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NjUzNDdmNTAzOTMwNzQ1NDFlNGZkZDBjZjdkNTA5MmQ=">Jonah Goldberg</a> is upset with Sulli and offers this advice:<br />
<blockquote>maybe Andrew Sullivan could simply take a few extra minutes and actually read Ramesh&#8217;s book.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know, I know – Goldberg is not exactly known to read books he has been asked to review, but just consider the Sulli post that Goldberg referred to.  As of <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/04/ramesh_coulter.html">April 26</a>, Sulli had admitted that he had not read the book entitled <em>The Party of Death: The Democrats, the Media, the Courts, and the Disregard for Human Life</em>. Sulli had read KLo claiming this book was not a partisan attack and decided to read at least a portion of the book where we read:<br />
<blockquote>Is the Democratic Party the &#8220;Party of Death&#8221;? If you look at their agenda they are.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Sulli has at least started to read this pathetic smear on my party.  But if Mr. Goldberg and KLo don’t realize that is an attack on the Democratic Party, I have to wonder if they have even read the title. </p>
<p>By the way, I have not bothered to read even one page of any of Ann Coulter’s books.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Does <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OWRjN2FkMDkyNGE3YmZmZWEyY2ZmZGRlZDZlM2IwMmY=">Jonah Goldberg</a> read anything?<br />
<blockquote>It seems to me that conservatives are going to have to respond to Jonathan Rauch&#8217;s argument in the new Atlantic &#8230; <strong>Me</strong>: One point which seems worth raising is that the key to this argument is that saying tax cuts don&#8217;t pay for themselves is different than saying tax cuts don&#8217;t result in increased revenue. This, it seems to me, is central to most conservative arguments for cutting taxes. The growth in spending Niskanen (an objectively credible voice, I should add) identifies is probably attributable to several factors &#8211; some of them noted by Mallaby &#8211; but one of them may be an increase in revenues. Anyway, I need to read the Rauch piece and there are others better qualified to deal with the economic issues. But if tax increases can be demonstrated to shrink government in some significant way, I&#8217;m certainly open to them. But there are way to many ifs and buts built into that hypothetical to deal with here and now. </p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, I wish he’d drop that childish habit of starting his uninformed opinion with “ME”.  Secondly, Rauch’s piece was not particularly long so he might have been able to read it in approximately the same amount of time that it would take Andrew Sullivan to read an entire book.  </p>
<p>But let me make this really simple for the very slow Jonah Goldberg.  Government spending as a share of GDP did not decline during the Reagan years and went up during the Bush43 years, which was Niskanen’s point.  Of course, this historical data has been clear to anyone who has bothered to follow anything in this debate.</p>
<p>As far as some supply-side effect, the reduction in national savings and investment from the Reagan and Bush43 tax cuts LOWERED economic growth so as Mr. Goldberg starts his babble trying to hold out hope for a Laffer curve increase in revenues from tax rate reductions, he shows he knows not a single thing about this issue.  <br />But when did incredible ignorance ever prevent Mr. Goldberg for opining on things he has no time to research?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002182.html">Max Sawicky</a> had some fun with Rush Limbaugh over whether Big Oil gets $0.09 per gallon or a 9% operating margin.  Unless a gallon of gasoline costs $1, there has to be a difference between these two statements.  In his comment box, Max linked to something from <a href="http://www.conocophillips.com/newsroom/other_resources/energyanswers/oil_profits.htm#Make_on_a_gallon_of_gas">ConocoPhillips</a>: <br />
<blockquote>An industry-wide study in the late 1990s showed that oil industry profits amounted to an estimated 7.3 cents on each gallon sold. More recently, ConocoPhillips reported that during the third quarter of 2005 earnings from its U.S. refining and marketing operations amounted to 9 cents per gallon. This compares with a national average retail price of $2.60 per gallon during the third quarter, the period of highest gasoline prices in 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>This statement does not say that Big Oil earns only $0.09 per gallon because much of the profits from a vertically integrated oil supplier come from its ownership of crude oil reserves, which are currently generating substantial economic rents.</p>
<p>In the ConocoPhillips link, you may have noticed that gasoline pump, which can also be found <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gasdiesel.asp">here</a>. EIA also provides this breakdown monthly from January 2000 to March 2006.  Distribution and marketing accounted for 4.5% of the reported $2.425 per gallon figure for March or almost $0.11 per gallon, while refining accounted for 21.7% or almost $0.53 per gallon.  So how did $0.64 per gallon become only $0.09 per gallon.  Perhaps because the EIA figures are the gross profits versus what ConocoPhillips is suggesting as operating profits.  </p>
<p>Of course, the rightwinger arguments are contradictory in this regard.  Rightwingers love to tell us that it is the lack of refinery capacity that is to blame for the high gasoline prices as if the refineries are collecting a lot of economic rent.  But then Rush tells us that these entities are not making very much in profits.  Clearly Rush is too eager to parrot what industry spokesman tell him without even bothering to understand the basic accounting issues. </p>
<p>Further down, the ConocoPhillips discussion compared operating profit margins to operating profit margins in other sectors:<br />
<blockquote>For example, a software company that clears $90 million in net income on product sales of $1 billion would earn a profit margin of 9 percent or 9 cents on each dollar of sales. Traditionally, oil companies have trailed many other industries in this measure of profitability. As indicated in the graphic, the profit margin of oil and natural gas companies was slightly above that of all industry in the third quarter of 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>A software company that has an operating margin of only 9%?  This can’t be Microsoft as its 2005 operating margin was almost 37%.  The operating margin for <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1163165/000110465906012015/0001104659-06-012015-index.htm">ConocoPhillips</a> in 2005 was over 13%, while the operating margin for <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/34088/000119312506040951/0001193125-06-040951-index.htm">Exxon</a> in 2005 was over 16%.  While we are talking about Exxon, let’s check out what <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=14488">Jack Kemp</a> is arguing:<br />
<blockquote>The retail market is competitive, and Exxon, for example, is but one-tenth of the total U.S. market.  They get a 7 percent to 8 percent return on investment and face a 45 percent to 46 percent marginal tax rate on corporate income.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exxon’s 2005 10-K reports only a 41% effective tax rate, but its reported return to capital is 31% not 8%.  Of course, Exxon is much more than a retailer given that not only refines oil into gasoline but also owns much of the oil that it utilizes.</p>
<p>Let’s return to the EIA figures to note that crude oil’s contribution to the price of gasoline in March 2006 was 54.8% or $1.33 per gallon.  Owners of crude oil – such as those OPEC nations – are earning very high economic rents.  I have to wonder if Mr. Limbaugh and Mr. Kemp understand the simple fact that part of the accounting profits for companies like Exxon are attributable to this economic rent from owning oil fields.  If we turn to page 54 of ConocoPhillips 10-K, which allocates income by each business segment, we that income from exploitation and production accounted for $8.43 billion out of $13.53 billion of total income.  And yet, Rush fails to include the lion’s share of their profits in his spin.</p>
<p>Unocal, which was predominately doing oil exploration and production before it was acquired, filed its last 10-K for fiscal year ended <a href="http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/716039/000119312505044680/0001193125-05-044680-index.htm">12/31/2004</a> and reported operating profits that exceeded 24% of its revenue even after deducting depletion, depreciation, and amortization expenses, which exceeded 12% of its revenue.</p>
<p>As much as Arlen Specter wants to impose anti-trust legislation upon Iran and Saudi Arabia, we as a nation really can’t.  Some liberals have suggested we resort to price controls to limit oil company profits, which would be an awful idea.  While I have suggested we tax some of the economic rent received on extraction of crude oil by companies like Exxon (or the former Unocal), other economists have disagreed with me.  But to suggest Big Oil is not making significant profits is certainly fuzzy accounting.</p>
