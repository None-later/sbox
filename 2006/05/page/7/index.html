<p>Memo to Mr. York: Brad DeLong has already awarded that Stupidest Man Alive trophy.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: God bless <a href="http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/05/05/desperation-sets-in">Jane Hamsher</a>!  While Byron York desperately hangs his hat on every piece of fabrication from Team Libby touting as it as the Gospel, Jane looks more carefully and calls these defense attorneys on their serial BS:<br />
<blockquote>If Walton thinks the whole thing sounds like bullshit now, wait ’til he sees the witness list. Can we assume the list will include Lt. General Tom McInerney and Maj. General Paul Vallely? </p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Over the past thirty years, extreme-left liberals have successfully shut down new energy production in the United States … The liberals also have stoked “Not in My Backyard” concerns in order to stop the building of new oil refineries … Finally, we now hear liberals screaming loudly about oil-company profits. But according to the Tax Foundation, the government takes about three-times as much in taxes from what you pay at the pump than the oil companies take in profits. Federal, state, and local gas taxes alone total about 46 cents per gallon, on average. Corporate income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, and other taxes tack on much more. Liberals, in fact, have been saying for years that American gas prices are too cheap, and that we should have to pay $4 to $5 a gallon, as is the case in Europe. That would lead to so much wonderful conservation, they say. But now we have just what they wished for. How do you like it? … Finally, we now hear liberals screaming loudly about oil-company profits.

Current estimates (and these pre-drilling estimates always end up being too conservative) reveal that this effectively would add another Saudi Arabia to the world oil supply. More, there is no significant environmental threat attached to the drilling planned in Alaska.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if Peter is partying with <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002182.html">Rush</a> this weekend.</p>
<p>Incidentally, one of Max’s readers pointed out <a href="http://yellowdogdems.blogspot.com/2005/08/big-oil-isnt-interested-in-anwr-but.html">this story</a> regarding ANWR:<br />
<blockquote>Big oil has stated that they are simply not interested in drilling in ANWR.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if Exxon et al. were interested in drilling in ANWR – I seriously doubt we would get nearly as much oil from there as from Saudi Arabia.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Employment Situation Summary</a> for April 2006 reports that employment per the payroll survey rose by 138,000.  The household survey shows an increase of only 47,000.  I wish I had better new for this Cinco de Mayo.  </p>
<p>I also want to know what the heck <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/05/news/economy/jobs_april/index.htm?cnn=yes">CNN</a> means by this:<br />
<blockquote>But the report had one reading that might be of concern to the Fed &#8211; average wages rose more than expected. The average hourly wage was up 9 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $16.61. Economists had forecast only a 0.3 percent rise after.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess these folks can’t stand the possibility that real wages might one day recover.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_05/008744.php">Kevin Drum</a> reads the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/04/AR2006050402063.html">Washington Post</a> also getting alarmed that real compensation might have increased. The WaPo’s evidence?<br />
<blockquote>But the slack that typified the nation&#8217;s labor market from 2001 until last year appears to have dissipated, and wages are starting to rise.  This tightening in the labor market was underscored yesterday by new government data. For most of the past five years, workers&#8217; productivity has risen faster than their compensation. But in the first quarter, the value of pay and benefits for workers rose at a 3.6 percent inflation-adjusted annual pace, as their productivity rose only 3.2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later in this story, we read:<br />
<blockquote>Wages for nonsupervisory workers rose 3.4 percent in the year ended in March, notes Economic Policy Institute Senior Economist Jared Bernstein. That&#8217;s less than consumer prices rose over that period, but mainly because of the sharp increase in energy prices in that span. In the year ended in March 2004, wages rose only 2.6 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Average hourly earnings of production or nonsupervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls in 1982$ was $8.30 as of July 2003 but was only $8.19 as of March 2006.</p>
<p>But back to Kevin:<br />
<blockquote>Even the slightest indication that workers might be gaining back some of the losses of the past five years is enough to send America&#8217;s economic elite into a tizzy. It&#8217;s funny that a 30% increase in CEO pay doesn&#8217;t seem to have the same effect, though, isn&#8217;t it?</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/05/are-wages-rising.html">Dean Baker</a> notes the divergent signals on whether real compensation is rising or falling:<br />
<blockquote>Last Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released the employment cost index (ECI) which showed a sharp slowing in the rate of nominal hourly compensation growth in the first quarter to an annual rate of just 2.4 percent. This is well below the rate of inflation, which, depending on the course of gas prices, will be in the range of 3.0-4.0 percent for this year. On Thursday, BLS released productivity data, which showed that hourly compensation was rising at an annual rate of 5.7 percent for the same quarter. Further complicating the picture is the employment report that BLS released this morning showing wages rising at a 4.7 percent annual rate over the most recent three months (compared to the prior 3-month average).</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean tries to explain what is going on with this data with the basic message being that while the growth in benefits has slowed, wage growth has accelerated.</p>

<blockquote>I&#8217;m going to use a number here because I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s applicable to somebody out there. Let&#8217;s say a tank full of gasoline costs you $55. Here&#8217;s the question. If Big Oil did not take one cent in profit, what would that $55 tank full of gas cost you? The profit is 9¢ per gallon. So if Big Oil didn&#8217;t take 1¢ in profit, a $55 tank full of gas would cost you $50, twice what people want to pay at 25 bucks a fill-up. So if Big Oil, the robber barons, don&#8217;t take any profit, a $55 fill-up is still going to cost you $50, and when there was no profit, if we were to pull this off, if there were no profit and a $55 tank full costs somebody 50, who would the liberals blame then? </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002182.html">Max Sawicky</a> listens, falls out of his chair laughing, but then gets up to write:<br />
<blockquote>If profit is 9 cents a gallon (bullshit, but let&#8217;s try and follow the logic) and zero profit saved you $5, by advanced mathematics it means you have a fifty-five gallon tank.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hold the phone as my mathematics may not be up to Rush’s, but if he can purchase 55 gallons of gasoline for only $55 – I want to know where he fills up!</p>
<p>Also – Max has a <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002181.html">request</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;ve started to collect ignorant statements from prominent people purporting to explain the price spikes in oil and gas. If you want to help, in the comments post the howlers you have heard from people like Limbaugh, Hannity, etc. It will help me prepare a fact check. Provide sources, links, etc. to the extent possible, and keep it pithy. Statements from liberals and Dems welcome as well. I&#8217;m interested in obvious misstatements of fact, not stuff requiring some deep analysis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Please help Max, but as you do, follow his reasonable set of instructions as his comment box is likely to be very crowded.</p>

<blockquote>According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official end of the last recession &#8211; and the origin of the current expansion &#8211; was November 2001. It’s true that since November 2001 lots of economic indicators have markedly improved. Real GDP has grown by 14.8 percent &#8230; Those are big numbers. But what catalyst triggered their birth in November 2001?  All I can think of is what happened the prior month &#8211; the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Terrorism causes prosperity? How’s that for an economic theory? That might not be as far-fetched as it sounds. Many economists believe that wars can trigger economic booms, so why should the war on terrorism be any different? But I have a better theory. It depends on using a different date for the end of the recession and the beginning of the expansion. Let’s see what happens if we use April 2003. I’m going to throw a lot of numbers at you here, but try to follow along. It’s going to be worth it.  In the 17 months from November 2001 (NBER’s official recession end-date) to April 2003 (my proposed recession end-date), real GDP grew 3.2 percent. But in the 36 months from April 2003 to now, real GDP has grown much more: 11.3 percent. </p></blockquote>
<p>“Those are big numbers?”  Good grief.  But don’t you just love this Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc nonsense?  A 11.3% increase over three years equates to a growth rate equal to 3.6% per year.  </p>
<p>I have another big number for Donald Duck.  During the Clinton years, real GDP grew by 33.8%.   OK, that was an eight year period, which means the average annual growth rate was 3.7%.  Now some bone head liberal might use this data to suggest increasing tax rates led to the faster growth.  After all, Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc.  </p>
<p>But to be fair to the bone head liberals of the world – there is a theoretical basis for suggesting fiscal restraint leads to more national savings, more investment, and higher long-term growth.  But let’s see if Donald Duck could explain to us how reducing national savings increases long-term growth.  In the meantime, could someone tell Donald his incredibly stupid op-ed has been done over and over by some of those other free lunch ducks.  Quack, quack.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Donald Duck has been trumped by another character from Toon Town: <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=14544">Robert Novak</a>:<br />
<blockquote>RNC Chairman Ken Mehlman met with Republican members of Congress this week to impress upon them just how bad the opinion polls are looking for them, and warning that they face a possible catastrophe in November. This warning contributed to GOP determination to pass a tax reconciliation bill that will extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts beyond their current expiration dates at the end of the decade &#8230; Despite all the media coverage given to the issues of immigration and &#8220;corruption,&#8221; polls show that the issue currently concerning voters the most &#8211; even more than immigration &#8211; is the wasteful spending by the Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are two ways to read the panic driven push for another tax “cut” (more properly tax shift) – (a) pandering; or (b) Novak’s claim that tax cuts are equivalent to spending cuts.  Via <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_05/008737.php">Kevin Drum</a> comes a regression (for whatever it is worth) provided by <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200606/tax-cuts">William Niskanen</a> that suggests Novak’s starve the beast theory has not applied during the Republican Administrations of the last generation.  So pandering, it is!</p>

This may be a little on the late side, but I was truly insulted by the National Review’s version of an obituary for Professor Galbraith, which was to replay this September 2001 smear from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzJjMTcxNTdlNmQ1OTgwM2M0M2Y1OGMxOWM3ZWU0Njc=">William Buckley</a>.  Consider, for example, this passage:<br />
<blockquote>Prime Minister Trudeau, who ruled over Canada for 15 years, superintending a drop in the Canadian dollar of 25 percent of its value, told the world that his economic policies were based on the work of John Kenneth Galbraith.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pierre Trudeau became Prime Minister on April 20, 1968 and remained in this position until June 4, 1979 and then regained the position for the period from March 3, 1980 to June 30, 1984.  Mr. Buckley failed to inform his reader that the Canadian dollar remained near parity with the U.S. dollar through 1977.  It is true that the Canadian dollar devalued 17.5% against the U.S dollar by the end of Trudeau’s first term and its value was virtually unchanged through the period ending on October 31, 1980 even though Trudeau was no longer Prime Minister for much of this period.  </p>
<p>As far as the further appreciation of the U.S. dollar with respect to the Canadian dollar from late 1980 to 1984, shouldn’t we note that most currencies followed this trend during the Reagan-Volcker mix of expansionary fiscal policies and tight monetary policies?  To blame this on Professor Galbraith is simply the stupidity we have come to expect from the National Review. </p>
<p>So why should I be shocked that these folks would have the incredibly poor taste to re-run this Buckley smear piece upon the Professor’s passing?</p>

Like Bill, I used to watch Lou’s show faithfully.  NPR ran an old interview when Lou gave three pieces of sage of advice to those of us who might try to discuss economics to the general public:</p>
<p>Rule #1: Speak English.</p>
<p>Rule #2: Know what you are talking about.</p>
<p>Rule #3: Inject a little flair.</p>
<p>But before he gave us #3, he interrupted himself to note that virtually no pundit succeeds at #1 and #2 at the same time.  As always, he did that with flair and humor.  I remember often finding himself simultaneously disagreeing with what Mr. Rukeyser and laughing with joy at the delightful way he made his point.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/05/libertarians_of.html#more">Mark Thoma</a> comes a debate between <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/05/01/david-frum/republicans-and-the-flight-of-opportunity">David Frum</a> and <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/05/02/bruce-bartlett/the-forecast-is-grim">Bruce Bartlett</a> as to the prospects of achieving fiscal responsibility through cuts in government spending.  The short answer is that we cannot.  Let’s have Mr. Frum up first:<br />
<blockquote>In the 1990s, the newly elected Republican congressional majority enjoyed what we can now see was the fairest opportunity in half a century to reduce the size and cost of the federal government:<br />* They had won a stunning and unexpected mid-term victory against a stunned and demoralized Democratic administration elected two years before by only 42% of the vote.<br />* They were backed by a bipartisan consensus that the huge deficits of the early 1990s had to be brought under control – without any further repeat of the tax increases of 1991 and 1993.<br />* The Cold War had ended, making possible substantial reductions in defense spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s stop right there as they were only two significant reasons why we reduced the deficit – the tax increases that the Republican Party opposed and those reductions in defense spending that have been at least partially reversed.  Mr. Frum pats Newt on the back for things like his freedom to farm fraud and talks about a booming economy that the free-lunch supply-side crowd claimed would never happen if we passed Clinton’s 1993 tax increase.  Frum continues:<br />
<blockquote>the congressional Republicans shifted course after 1998. Medicare reform was abandoned; spending accelerated.  And this change of course was ratified by the whole party in the nomination contest of 1999-2000, when George W. Bush swept to a crushing triumph by campaigning as a “compassionate conservative” opposed to budget-cutting and committed to maintaining Medicare and Medicaid in more or less their existing form. In September 1999, he condemned congressional Republican attempts to curb the Earned Income Tax Credit as “balancing their budget on the backs of the poor.” In the following general election, Bush committed himself to adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare &#8230; The fairest chance to achieve the limited-government agenda passed with only very limited conservative success.  The state is growing again—and it is preprogrammed to carry on growing. Health spending will rise, pension spending will rise, and taxes will rise.</p></blockquote>
<p>No argument here, so let’s turn the microphone over to Bruce Bartlett:<br />
<blockquote>Like David, I am very pessimistic about the prospects for conservative/libertarian reform. He is exactly right that demographically-driven federal spending is rising rapidly as the baby boom generation nears retirement, and the best political opportunity for restructuring Social Security and Medicare has passed. As the percentage of voters benefiting from these programs in their current form rises, it is unrealistic to think that spending for them can be reduced except marginally.  David is also right that the Republican Party has become deeply corrupt and appears to lack any leaders with the potential for pushing it back in a more conservative direction. It is going to have to suffer a defeat of Nixonian proportions in order to cleanse the party and create opportunities for new leaders to emerge that may be able to right its course &#8230; In many ways, this is my perspective as well. Because of it, I concluded that conservatives and libertarians need to think seriously about how best to finance the government spending that is in the pipeline. Given the magnitude of that spending growth—on the order of 10 percent of the gross domestic product over the next generation even if no new government programs are enacted or current ones expanded—I have suggested that it is time to think about a value-added tax for the U.S.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I’d be less inclined to rely on the VAT than Bruce is, I have to admire the fact that he does not duck the question as to where he would raise taxes.  Now if we could get this kind of honesty from our elected officials.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12612901">AP</a> reports on the continuing political pandering from George W. Bush:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON &#8211; Striving for a badly needed congressional score, President Bush urged Congress Wednesday to pass a multibillion-dollar bill extending tax cuts for businesses and families, especially at a time of soaring gas prices. “A tax increase would be disastrous for business, disastrous for families and disastrous for this economy,” Bush said. Republicans on Capitol Hill already had reached agreement in principle on a $70 billion tax relief package that would extend tax cuts on dividends and capital gains and keep 15 million middle income taxpayers from getting hit with a tax designed for the wealthy, GOP aides said. Bush, who has made tax cuts his signature domestic issue, said extending the tax cuts would provide certainty in the tax code and foster business investment. “If the people have their way who want this tax relief to expire, the American people will be hit with $2.4 trillion in higher taxes over the next decade,” he said. “It would be handed over to government — that’s where the money would go. It would be taken out of the economy and given to people here in Washington, D.C., to spend.” Bush said tax relief is responsible for a strong U.S. economy. For the first quarter, the economy grew at a 4.8 percent pace, the fastest in 2 1/2 years. A big pickup in consumer spending figured prominently in the strong showing, which surpassed the 3.5 percent growth rate for 2005. “Our economy’s growth in 2005 was faster than Japan, more than twice as fast as France and more than three times as fast as Germany,” he said. “The American economy is the fastest growing of any major industrialized nation in the world.” Recent growth, however, hasn’t helped Bush’s standing with the public. He is shouldering his lowest-ever job approval rating, at 36 percent, according to a recent Associated Press-Ipsos poll.</p></blockquote>
<p>You know – one can summarize the GOP approach to elections thusly: “vote for us as we will lie to you”.  It seems such dishonesty only works for a few years.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update II</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.cato.org/pub_display.php?pub_id=3750">Stephen Slivinski</a> blames the Bush deficits on an explosion in spending:<br />
<blockquote>President Bush has presided over the largest overall increase in inflation-adjusted federal spending since Lyndon B. Johnson. Even after excluding spending on defense and homeland security, Bush is still the biggest-spending president in 30 years. His 2006 budget doesn’t cut enough spending to change his place in history, either. Total government spending grew by 33 percent during Bush’s first term. The federal budget as a share of the economy grew from 18.5 percent of GDP on Clinton’s last day in office to 20.3 percent by the end of Bush’s first term.</p></blockquote>
<p>He jumps from an unspecified percentage increase in real spending to an increase in nominal spending – hoping we will not notice.  Table 1.1.6 from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/bea/dn/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">BEA</a> allows us to compare real government purchases across time.  It did not break real government purchases between Federal versus state back in the 1960’s but we can see that real total government purchases were about 27% higher in 1968 than in 1963.  Real purchases in 2005 were only 15% higher in 2005 than they were in 2000.  Maybe conservatives can complain that Bush increased spending relative to GDP rather than cutting spending relative to GDP – but the main reason for the explosion in the Federal deficit was the Bush tax cuts (or should I say tax SHIFTS).</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I’m a little surprised that the National Review has yet to comment on yesterdays’ release of the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/social-security-2006-trustees-report.html">Social Security 2006 Trustee Report</a>, but I guess they have outsourced spin manufacturing to <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=14479">Patrick Wetherille</a> of Human Events Online:<br />
<blockquote>The Social Security trustees yesterday released their annual report on the state of the Social Security system.  Surprise, surprise, the system is going broke &#8211; faster than it was last year, no less &#8211; but what is Congress doing about it?  Nothing. Most people ask themselves why a system that is running surpluses seems to keep losing money faster and faster every year that goes by.  The answer is quite simple: Congress is raiding your retirement. Unfortunately, the surplus money that could be used to help fix the system is being spent on anything but retirement.  For years, Social Security’s “Trust Fund” has been poured into the federal government through creative accounting, resulting in a disingenuous representation of the program’s finances. Every year, Congress takes the Social Security surplus and borrows it to itself.  It spends those surpluses on federal programs that have nothing to do with your retirement.  It then promises to pay the money back to itself &#8211; with interest! &#8211; at some future date.  That’s how Social Security is supposedly solvent for decades to come.  According to the bipartisan Social Security trustees (who were appointed by President Clinton), the system has a 97.5% chance that it will face permanent cash deficits starting in 2022.  They also report that the total amount of cash needed to fix the system has increased by $2.3 trillion, just since last year’s report.  It’s no wonder they have called upon Congress to take “timely and effective action” to fix the system now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wetherille simultaneously notes that the Trust Fund is running surpluses and claims it is getting deeper into debt.  He claims those of us who wish to keep clear tabs on the General Fund, which is indeed running very large deficits, and the Trust Fund are guilty of “creative accounting”.  Rich!  But yes, we are running large General Fund deficits to which Human Events Online’s <a href="http://www.humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=14489">David Limbaugh</a> runs an op-ed entitled <em>Time to Extend the Bush Tax Cuts</em> on the very same page of Wetherille’s spin!  Limbaugh is trying to convince his readers that the Bush tax cuts increased tax revenues.  Amazing!</p>
<p>I’m glad that Wetherille admits that the Social Security Trust Fund reserves are receiving interest.  But I have to wonder if he realizes that the only reason that he can write “the total amount of cash needed to fix the system has increased by $2.3 trillion” is that the Trustee’s arbitrarily lowered their assumed interest rate?  And does he not realize that he is talking about cash in the very different future and not cash today?  As long as interest rates are positive – this distinction matters a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: As I was trying to understand why the Trustees decided on this assumption that real interest rates would average 2.9% versus their 3.0% assumption last year, it struck me (DUH) to actually read what their <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR06/V_economic.html#wp168822">report said</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In developing a reasonable range of assumed ultimate future real interest rates for the three alternatives, historical experience was examined for the 40 years, 1965-2004, and for each of the 10-year subperiods, 1965-74, 1975-84, 1985-94, and 1995-2004. For the 40-year period, the real interest rate averaged 2.9 percent per year. For the four 10-year subperiods, the real interest rates averaged 0.9, 1.9, 5.2, and 3.5 percent, respectively. The assumed ultimate real interest rates are 3.6 percent, 2.9 percent, and 2.1 percent for the low cost, intermediate, and high cost assumptions, respectively. The ultimate real yields, which are assumed to be reached by the end of the short-range period, are 0.1 percentage point lower than those assumed in the 2005 report. The lower assumed rates reflect recent low realized rates, particularly on Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS), and an expectation that low real interest rates will persist.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is the average of the past 40 years a reasonable means for forecasting the future?  Is their expectation that low real interest rates will persist a plausible one?</p>

                                <p>As I read the latest from <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/02/news/economy/republicans_taxes/index.htm">CNN</a>, I may need to apologize (partially) to Senator Frist:<br />
<blockquote>NEW YORK (CNNMoney.com) &#8211; Senate Republicans have withdrawn a tax provision in their energy legislation that would have generated billions of dollars by changing the way businesses treat inventories for tax purposes, according to a report in The New York Times.</p></blockquote>
<p>So it turns out that the Senator was contemplating some means for giving low to middle income consumers a tax break by increasing taxes on businesses and not by increasing even further the deficit.  But then I read the rest of this story:<br />
<blockquote>Sen. Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said he had decided &#8211; for now &#8211; to jettison the provision, which was met with widespread opposition in the business community. Instead, he indicated that the Senate Finance Committee would hold hearings on the plan &#8220;later this year, so the plusses and minuses of the provision can become well known,&#8221; the newspaper said &#8230; The newspaper said the Republicans backed off from their proposal after facing a torrent of objections from business leaders and the oil industry, who typically view Republicans in Congress as allies.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words – NEVER MIND!</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: Presidential economic advisor <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2006/05/02/news/economy/bush_lazear.reut/index.htm">Edward Lazear</a> argues against tax cuts for gasoline:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (Reuters) &#8211; Senior White House economist Edward Lazear said Tuesday that proposals to cut the gasoline tax would take energy policy in the wrong direction by encouraging consumption.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly – why do the pandering politicians wish to encourage more consumption of oil?</p>
<p><em><strong>Update II</strong></em>: <a href="http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002174.html">Max Sawicky</a> joins us at the oil tax increase coalition and sips some <a href="http://www.tpmcafe.com/node/29442">coffee</a> as he provides more insights.</p>
