                                                                    </div>

                                <p>In their coverage of that $70 billion addition to the Federal debt, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/11/AR2006051100177_2.html">Washington Post</a> adds:<br />
<blockquote>House Majority Leader John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) said that holding the line on spending while allowing the low tax rates to spur the economy will close the gap. But the spending problem lies not so much with the federal programs at Congress&#8217;s annual discretion but with entitlement programs such as Medicare and Social Security, which will grow by 23 percent through 2010. To close the projected budget deficit by 2010, the economy would have to grow at an average annual rate of 4.9 percent &#8211; or 5.5 percent if war costs continue but taper off, according to Leonard E. Burman, a tax policy analyst at the Urban Institute. Such rates have not been seen since the mid-1960s, and most economists see them as impossible, if for no other reason than that the Federal Reserve Board would raise interest rates enough to cool down the growth</p></blockquote>
<p>Real GDP growth averaged 3.5% per year from 1947 to 2000 and if the OMB’s predictions are correct, the average annual growth rate for the first decade of this century will be less than 3%.  Boehner knows that closing the fiscal gap without tax increases cannot happen unless Congress and the White House have the political courage to massively slash government spending, which of course, they don’t.  And for all the nonsense about free lunch supply-side economics, reducing national savings does not increase long-term growth.  </p>
<p><a href="http://beatthepress.blogspot.com/2006/05/medicare-and-social-security-hoax.html">Dean Baker</a> objects to the discussion of entitlements:<br />
<blockquote>The cost of Social Security is rising only slightly faster than GDP. Over the next decade, Social Security spending is projected to increase by just 0.2 percentage points as a share of GDP. By contrast, spending on Medicare and Medicaid is projected to increase by a total of 1.5 percentage points of GDP. Furthermore, Social Security is financed by a designated tax that is projected to keep the program fully solvent through the 2052 by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office. This means that any cuts to Social Security should in principle be matched by cuts in the tax, unless the intention is to mislead people about the purpose of this tax. There is a large and powerful lobby that would badly like to cut and/or privatize Social Security, and they have no qualms about playing with the truth to advance their agenda. The media should not help them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, while the opening of this post says $70 billion &#8211; <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2006_05/008797.php">Kevin Drum</a> notes:<br />
<blockquote>Here&#8217;s the gimmick. On a regular IRA, you pay no taxes on contributions, but you do pay taxes when you withdraw money. Roth IRAs are just the opposite. So when you do the five-year projections, this bill makes the deficit look a little better because more people are paying taxes on their contributions in 2010-2012 as they switch to a Roth. But the cost is $100 billion or so in the out years. But hey. As long as it makes the five-year projection look better, that&#8217;s all that matters. If you&#8217;re a Republican, anyway.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Reading the news this morning I feel like we&#8217;re reliving <a href="http://www.nypost.com/postopinion/opedcolumnists/62512.htm">the Carter years</a>.  The drop in consumer sentiment reported today by the University of Michigan, as well as <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/bush_poll_dc;_ylt=AsczwPtm9cwpGflbMH7qoLis0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2Z2szazkxBHNlYwN0bQ--">Bush&#8217;s dismal approval ratings</a>, both seem like echoes from the late 1970s.  From Marketwatch:<br />
<blockquote><strong>Consumer sentiment plunges to 7-month low</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BE16C1EEC-FDFF-4ABB-96FA-8C975CB5DA59%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8211; U.S. consumers&#8217; attitudes about the current economic situation plunged in May at the fastest rate in at least 28 years, according to media reports Friday of proprietary research.</p>
<p>The University of Michigan consumer sentiment index fell to 79.0 in May from 87.4 in April, the lowest since October&#8217;s 74.2. The current conditions index, which tends to track gasoline prices and unemployment, plunged 13 points to 96.2, the biggest one-month decline in the survey&#8217;s 28-year history. It&#8217;s the lowest level for current conditions since October. The expectations index fell to 68.0 from 73.4, also the lowest since October.</p>
<p>Consumer sentiment has fallen in four of the past five months after peaking at 91.5 in December after the economy bounced back from the hurricanes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly, a large part of the explanation for this is simply high gas prices.  High gas prices can sour the mood of the American public in ways that almost nothing else can.  But, at least so far, this pessimism has not translated into much of a slowdown in spending.  If and when that does finally happen, the US economy will surely feel it.</p>

<blockquote>I HADN&#8217;T HEARD THIS: Bush&#8217;s tax cuts make the tax system more progressive, according to a new study from the Joint Economic Committee. Of course, what&#8217;s really interesting is how little tax revenue comes from people in lower brackets.</p></blockquote>
<p>They point to <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2006/05/joint_economic__1.html">this link</a>, which links to a paper from <a href="http://www.house.gov/jec/publications/109/rr109-36.pdf">Jim Saxton’s hacks</a>. Never mind that Jonah Goldberg can’t bother to read up on the fact that these are only <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/progressive-tax-cut-what-tax-cut.html">tax deferrals</a> (incidentally, Goldberg is continuing to attack Andrew Sullivan for not reading Party of Death as he continues to be too lazy to read anything sensible on economics), neither Jonah nor Glenn has any clue what this paper really says.  It does NOT say the tax code has become more progressive as a result of the most recent tax deferral.  Nor does it say that it is more progressive as a result of either the 2001 or the 2003 tax cuts.  </p>
<p>No, all it says is that if one looks at only Federal income taxes paid, the very rich pay a lot in taxes.  That does not even compare the average tax rates of each group for this narrow subset of taxes paid by individuals.  Never mind all those deferred tax liabilities that George W. Bush wants to pretend no one will be responsible for.  Glenn Reynolds cannot even bother to actually READ a 2-page piece of spin from a bunch of rightwing hacks posing as government economists!</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://yglesias.tpmcafe.com/node/29769">Matthew Yglesias</a> has more closing with:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s a little disappointing that the Republican Party thinks that misleading people is a good use of time for the people working at the JEC and the Council of Economic Advisors when they could be spending time developing policies or trying to make the population better informed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Think about it – we taxpayers foot the bill for Saxton’s hacks at the JEC.  Why am I paying taxes to support economic dishonesty?</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2006/05/matt_yglesias_i.html">Brad DeLong</a> says young Matthew is a philosophical naïf:<br />
<blockquote>Matt is wrong when he says that Reynolds and Goldberg &#8220;believe the world operates in totally bizarre ways.&#8221; You cannot make inferences from what they write to what their beliefs are.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe I’m also a philosophical naïf – so tell me, did Brad just suggest that Jonah Goldberg lies?  Stupidity or Mendacity?  With Goldberg, it is really hard to tell!</p>

<blockquote>Dynamic scoring, however, attempts to measure the feedback-effects ignored in these models &#8211; those feedback-effects potentially becoming excellent ammunition for supply-side policymakers and tax-cut advocates. There’s no doubt that dynamic scoring is today being taken seriously within the budgeting community &#8230; More importantly, as the debate over dynamic scoring heats up, we’re seeing more and more evidence that dynamic scoring actually works. Harvard professor N. Gregory Mankiw, who served as chairman of President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers between 2003 and 2005, wrote in a 2004 paper that “The feedback [from dynamic scoring] is surprisingly large: for standard parameter values, half of a capital tax cut is self-financing.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Did Kaza only read the <a href="http://www.nber.org/digest/jul05/w11000.html">summary</a> of the paper by Gregory Mankiw and Matthew Weinzierl?  If so, perhaps he failed to notice something about their model.  Government spending – in the form of transfer payments &#8211; in this paper was assumed to follow tax revenues.  In other words, the model assumed away any material crowding-out effects.  Now given the propensity of the Republican Congress and Bush White House to spend and borrow as they pretend to give us tax cuts, a result that is predicated on the assumption of balanced budgets and no crowding-out is not a useful guide to judging current fiscal policy.</p>

                                <p>Is <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTQyYzUzZTZkZGVkZmI3MWU4YzMwYTFhNDhhOTNlMmE=">Barbara Lerner</a> advocating an invasion of Iran?  <br />
<blockquote>Only America has both the courage and the military might to save these Iranians, along with ourselves and decent people of all religions everywhere, from the new age of barbarism that threatens us all. To do that, we must ignore the Chamberlains among us and rally behind our Churchills, and we must act. In 2003, 2004, and even 2005, I thought we could rein in the mullahs without needing to attack Iran itself. I thought we could send them a sufficiently chilling message by striking the terrorist strongholds of their smaller, weaker surrogates in Syria and Hezbollahland. Now, it is too late for that. We need to get ready as quickly as possible to mount a major air assault, not just to take out as many of Iran&#8217;s nuclear sites as we can find, but to defeat the rising evil behind them by aiming our bombs and missiles at Iran&#8217;s leaders, its Revolutionary Guards, and the bully boys of the Basij too. But we cannot stop there; we also need to bomb Hezbollahland in Lebanon</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess so, which is no surprise given this:<br />
<blockquote>I think President Bush&#8217;s decision to invade Iraq and dethrone Saddam Hussein was a brave, right, and necessary decision, and an essential part of a much larger war we have no choice but to fight and win—the global, 21st-century war against Islamofascist supremacy and terror. And like many conservatives, I think the Bush administration handled the invasion of Iraq brilliantly, but made an awful mess of the post-invasion period.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Hmmm – a Biden Democrat is she?</strong>  She claims to have followed Biden in criticizing the post-invasion fiasco but then:<br />
<blockquote>In 2006, as the bloodshed in Iraq persisted and the regional situation deteriorated, I stopped criticizing our policies in Iraq for the same reason many other conservatives have lately been reluctant to do so: for fear of adding weight to a Leftist alternative that is even worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>The current rightwing rational for not criticizing this White House does seem to be it’s the fault of us liberals.  But she does admit to three mistakes:<br />
<blockquote>The surest way to draw those wrong conclusions would be to accept the analysis of the rebel generals currently baying for our Defense secretary&#8217;s head, because the three mistakes they harp on aren&#8217;t mistakes at all, and the three big mistakes we really did make weren&#8217;t made by Donald Rumsfeld. They are the mistakes of the State Department, the CIA, and the rebel generals themselves</p></blockquote>
<p>She claims that mistake #1 was NOT an inadequate number of U.S. troops and Rumsfeld’s actions to “de-Baathify the country aggressively” – but simply having Paul Bremer in charge.  She also claims we made a mistake of being too sensitive “to the finer nuances of Iraqi culture”.  Finally, she claims mistake #3 was ignoring the neighbors in the sense that she believed we shouldn’t have had military action against Iran sooner.  I guess Lerner needs to consult with Karl Rove on the calendar thing.  The crucial date in question is in November 2006 – when the National Review and the Rove Republicans need to win the war on us Democrats.  </p>
<p>I hope I’m wrong here – I hope the grownups in the Republican Party step up and demand diplomacy and not another idiotic invasion.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em></strong>: <a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/014812.html">Talkleft</a> is suggesting that our military is already sending aircraft carriers towards Iran for possible air strikes this summer.  I do hope this is not the White House plan.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve discussed the shortcomings of the US&#8217;s current system of health insurance provision in great detail over the past year or so.  But new evidence keeps emerging about how poorly the US&#8217;s system performs when it comes to health outcomes (see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/04/performance-of-us-health-care-system.html">this post</a> for some of my earlier evidence).  </p>
<p>Last week it was <a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/295/17/2037">this JAMA article</a>, which provided statistical evidence that Americans are significantly less healthy than individuals in the UK, even after controlling for differences in demographics and lifestyle.  (See Krugman&#8217;s piece about the study for more on this, as excerpted by <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2006/05/paul_krugman_ou.html">Mark Thoma</a>.)</p>
<p>This week new data about the relative performance of the US health care system is provided by Save the Children.  In their annual report &#8220;<a href="http://www.savethechildren.org/news/index.asp">The State of the World&#8217;s Mothers</a>&#8220;, they examine infant mortality around the world.  Marketwatch reports:<br />
<blockquote><strong>U.S. has high rate of newborn deaths</strong></p>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO (<a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=%7BB72772D9-44DE-48AE-A949-FE5B51AEB8F8%7D&#038;siteid=mktw&#038;dist=">MarketWatch</a>) &#8212; Newborns in the United States have the second lowest survival rate in the industrialized world, according to a report released this week.</p>
<p>Babies in their first month of life have the best odds in Japan, which boasts the lowest newborn mortality rate of 1.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, according to a report from the nonprofit group Save the Children. Latvia had the highest mortality rate among the 33 industrialized nations surveyed, at six newborn deaths per 1,000 live births.</p>
<p>The U.S. ranked next to last and tied with Hungary, Malta, Poland and Slovakia, which all averaged five deaths per 1,000 live births. The U.S. newborn mortality rate is nearly three times higher than that of Finland, Iceland, Norway and Japan, the study found.</p></blockquote>
<p>What do all of the countries that are most dangerous for infants have in common?  They are all among the poorest countries in the industrialized world&#8230; except for the US.  The US&#8217;s distinction is that it is the only country without universal health insurance.</p>
<p>To be fair, some of the US&#8217;s poor performance in infant mortality measures is due to differences in statistical definitions and standard medical practice.  For example, doctors in the US tend to be more aggressive about attempting to resuscitate very premature newborns than doctors elsewhere, so extremely premature infants are more likely to be classified as live births &#8211; and their deaths more likely to be classified as infant deaths &#8211; than in countries with less aggressive resuscitation policies, where such instances would tend to be classified as fetal deaths instead. </p>
<p>However, it turns out that this is not a sufficient explanation for the US&#8217;s poor performance in infant mortality measures.  Back in 1992 a CBO study called &#8220;<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=6219&#038;sequence=0">Factors Contributing to the Infant Mortality Ranking of the US</a>&#8221; explicitly tried to identify why infants in the US tend to die so much more often than infants in the rest of the developed world.</p>
<p>They examined the possibility that differences in medical practice and statistical definitions are to blame.  And they found that, while they do make a bit of difference, the difference is small.  The standard measure of infant mortality placed the US at #22 in the world.  Using a modified measure that corrects for differences in definitions regarding extremely premature births did improve the US&#8217;s ranking slightly, but only slightly &#8211; to #19 in the world.</p>
<p>The CBO report concluded that the biggest culprit in the US&#8217;s poor infant mortality rates is the relative prevalence of low birthweight among newborns in the US.  For some reason, more small, unhealthy babies are born in the US than in other rich countries.  Since many other studies have repeatedly shown that the best way to prevent low birthweight babies is proper prenatal care, it seems a fair conclusion to say that insufficient prenatal care is probably the biggest single factor in explaining the US&#8217;s relatively poor infant survival rates.</p>
<p>Explaining the US&#8217;s poor infant mortality data therefore boils down to this question: why do so many women in the US seem to receive inadequate prenatal care?  Clearly, insufficient health insurance coverage for prenatal health care must be considered the leading candidate to explain this problem.  </p>
<p>So let&#8217;s chalk up another cost to the US&#8217;s patchwork system of inadequate or non-existent health insurance: thousands of preventable infant deaths every year.</p>

<blockquote>In a memoir published Tuesday, the 37-year-old lesbian describes a proposed constitutional ban on same-sex marriage as a &#8220;gross affront&#8221; to gay Americans and reveals she almost quit the Republican campaign after President George W. Bush&#8217;s endorsement of the legislation two years ago. But Cheney saves her harshest words for Bush&#8217;s 2004 opponents, calling Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry a &#8220;son of a bitch&#8221; and his running mate, John Edwards, a &#8220;total slime&#8221; for discussing her sexual orientation during nationally televised debates during the campaign. The 239-page autobiography has vaulted the publicity-shy political operative back into the Washington spotlight she&#8217;s already appeared in a prime-time interview with ABC&#8217;s Diane Sawyer and provoked mixed reviews from gay rights activists who are bracing for a Senate vote next month on the Republican-sponsored gay-marriage ban. &#8220;She is a little late to the party,&#8221; said John Aravosis, a Washington gay-rights activist and political blogger. &#8220;For the longest time, Mary wouldn&#8217;t speak. Now she gets a million-dollar book advance and suddenly she is speaking. It rings a little hollow.&#8221; Cheney became a flashpoint for both sides in America&#8217;s culture wars during the 2004 campaign after Bush endorsed the constitutional ban to shore up political support on the religious right. Cheney, who served as director of her father&#8217;s re-election campaign, stayed silent when Aravosis launched a controversial Internet campaign DearMary.com pleading with her to denounce Bush. She stayed silent when Kerry, during a debate with Bush, responded to a question on whether homosexuality was a choice by telling the nation Dick Cheney had a daughter &#8220;who is a lesbian.&#8221; And she bit her tongue when a Republican Senate candidate, Alan Keyes, accused her of &#8220;selfish hedonism&#8221; for living a homosexual lifestyle. But in her book, Cheney reveals she refused to attend Bush&#8217;s 2004 State of the Union address after reading a draft copy of the speech that spoke of the need to defend the sanctity of marriage. When Bush later endorsed a constitutional amendment to expressly forbid gay marriage, Cheney &#8220;seriously considered packing up my office and heading home&#8221; to the house she shared in Colorado with her longtime partner, Heather Poe. It &#8220;gave me a knot in the pit of my stomach to think of my candidate for president endorsing the federal marriage amendment,&#8221; she writes. The gay marriage ban &#8220;would write discrimination into the constitution, our nation&#8217;s most important and influential document,&#8221; Cheney says in the book. &#8220;It is fundamentally wrong and a gross affront to gays and lesbians everywhere.&#8221; In her interview with Diane Sawyer, Cheney said of Bush: &#8220;I think he&#8217;s a very good man On these issues, he hasn&#8217;t caught up.&#8221; Cheney is less generous to Kerry and Edwards, who she accuses of &#8220;sleazy&#8221; politics for mentioning she was gay during debates with Bush and her father. &#8220;John Kerry didn&#8217;t &#8216;out me&#8217;, nor did he offend or attack me by calling me a lesbian. It wasn&#8217;t a secret that I was gay, and I certainly couldn&#8217;t be offended by the truth,&#8221; she writes. &#8220;What was offensive E was that he was obviously trying to use me and my sexual orientation for his own political gain.&#8221; Sitting in the studio audience when Edwards mentioned her sexual orientation, Cheney said she looked at the vice-presidential candidate and mouthed the words&#8221;Go F*** Yourself&#8221; a phrase her father had earlier employed against Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy.</p></blockquote>
<p>What did Senator Kerry say about Ms. Cheney?  Oh yea, that she was one of God’s children.  To which Ms. Cheney’s mother decided to help out Karl Rove’s slime machine with fake indignation.  </p>
<p>Hey it’s great that Mary is speaking out for the rights of homosexuals NOW – but she supported Bush’s reelection in 2004.  “Late to the party” indeed.  But, let’s have <a href="http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Kerry_hits_back_at_Mary_Cheney_0510.html">Senator Kerry</a> speak for himself:<br />
<blockquote>Kerry spokesman David Wade said Mary Cheney had &#8220;flacked for the most anti-gay administration in history.&#8221; “Seems like a suspicious lecture from a political operative who flacked for the most anti-gay administration in history and allowed Karl Rove to divide America for political gain,&#8221; Wade said. &#8220;She’d be more credible if she pushed dad’s administration to support hate crimes legislation and equal rights for gay Americans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Or as Ms. Cheney’s dad might say: “go f*** yourself&#8217;”.  Speaking of which, Dick Cheney mentioned his daughter’s sexuality during the 2000 Vice Presidential debate and we know he is truly a SOB.  Mary Cheney – still a tool for the rightwing who want society and the government to treat homosexuals as third class citizens (if not worse).  </p>
<p>But I should say something about economics, so let’s turn to <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/column/120600.html">Paul Krugman</a> who notes that Dick Cheney is a Vulgar Keynesian:<br />
<blockquote>First, on their face Mr. Cheney&#8217;s remarks were those of a vulgar Keynesian &#8211; a believer in the now- discredited doctrine that taxes and spending should be routinely twiddled in an attempt to &#8220;fine-tune&#8221; the economy.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Welcome back Kash and thanks for <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/raising-future-taxes-yet-again.html">this post</a>!  I trust you saw those <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/cato-unbound-what-tax-increases-would.html">Cato Unbound</a> discussions – and it seems <a href="http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/05/10/david-frum/reply-to-comments-small-successes-are-big-achievements">David Frum</a> is still as confused as ever:<br />
<blockquote>If we must have tax increases, the VAT would not be one of my choices, for the reason Summers predicts &#8211; I fear it will generate so much revenue as to accelerate government spending. I’d look instead at Irwin Stelzer’s idea of a tax on oil and natural gas. I’d also want to consider taxing employer-provided health insurance as income: not only would such a tax be highly progressive, but it would also advance the important policy goal of severing health insurance from employment. Bartlett’s idea at least has the great merit of forcing conservatives to recognize that President Bush’s tax-cutting achievements have been rendered unstable by over-spending — and that the GOP’s failure to act on spending today threatens to guarantee tax increases in the future. I agree with Ross Douthat and Reihan Salam about the importance of addressing the social problems that drive the growth of government &#8230; But the health care problem is not beyond the reach of sensible policy — which is why by the way I think Gov. Romney’s Massachusetts health care reforms deserve conservative support.</p></blockquote>
<p>First of all, let me suggest that I’m closer to Frum than to Bartlett on which taxes should be raised.  And I’m elated that he is coming around to our position on health care reforms – especially since he worked for a White House that opposed our positions and even took steps to make health care even more inefficient and costly.  But he still argues that tax cutters (ah, I meant tax deferrers) like Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush do better in limiting government spending than fiscally responsible leaders like Bill Clinton.  Never mind the evidence says otherwise.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong></em>: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/09/AR2006050901214.html">Robert Samuelson</a> writes (and <a href="http://time.blogs.com/daily_dish/2006/05/factoid_of_the_.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> takes note):<br />
<blockquote>Social spending and regulation (for education, anti-poverty programs, health care, the environment) have consistently expanded. In 1954 defense accounted for 69.5 percent of federal spending and &#8220;human resources&#8221; (programs such as Social Security, Medicare, job training and food stamps) only 18.5 percent. In 2005 defense was 20 percent and human resources 64.2 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sulli suggests that the military-industrial complex has been replaced by the “senior-entitlement complex”.  Measuring expenditure items as percentages of the Federal budget can produce some shock statistics, but it strikes me as an odd way to evaluate this issue.  My preference would be to look at these items as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/01/2006-year-of-small-government.html">percentages of GDP</a> over time – and yes, defense spending as a share of GDP is less today than it was during the Cold War.  I guess Robert “not Paul” Samuelson agrees with Sulli that the government should turn back the clock fifty years on the War on Poverty and providing a defined benefits retirement system.  Sorry fellows – but I beg to differ.</p>
<p><strong>Update II</strong>: Three Republican Senators voted against that INCREASE in FUTURE TAXES –Olympia J. Snowe, Lincoln Chafee, and George Voinovich.  While I applaud them, <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NWNhMzQzZDdkMzBiMWM0M2IxOTUxZjE4NWE3ZDFmN2Y=">John Miller</a> does not.  I guess the folks at the National Review have no clue what <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/raising-future-taxes-yet-again.html">Kash</a> was trying to tell everyone.  Thank goodness that 3 Republican Senators get the simple point and had there been 48 Democrats in the Senate to vote against this irresponsibility, it would not have passed.</p>
<p><strong>Final Update</strong>: I was wrong &#8211; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/05/11/tax.cuts.ap/index.html">CNN</a> lets us know there were 3 pandering Democrats in the Senate: <br />
<blockquote>Democrats Ben Nelson of Nebraska, Bill Nelson of Florida and Mark Pryor of Arkansas voted in favor. Republican Gordon Smith of Oregon originally registered a &#8220;nay&#8221; vote but changed to &#8220;aye&#8221; just before the tally was announced. Republicans said to fail to extend the tax cuts would amount to a tax increase on investors, big and small, as well as on families facing the alternative minimum tax. They&#8217;ve dubbed the bill the &#8220;Tax Increase Prevention Act.&#8221; &#8220;Are we going to increase taxes on well over 100 million people &#8230; or are we going to keep takes low?&#8221; said Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tennessee. Appearing with Frist and other GOP senators, Treasury Secretary John Snow said, &#8220;This is a defining day. A vote today will tell the American people who supports lower taxes and who doesn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The FOMC (the interest rate-setting committee at the Fed) raised the Federal Funds rate to 5.0% today.  Here&#8217;s the important bit of <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/press/monetary/2006/20060510/">the accompanying statement</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Economic growth has been quite strong so far this year. The Committee sees growth as likely to moderate to a more sustainable pace, partly reflecting a gradual cooling of the housing market and the lagged effects of increases in interest rates and energy prices.</p>
<p>As yet, the run-up in the prices of energy and other commodities appears to have had only a modest effect on core inflation, ongoing productivity gains have helped to hold the growth of unit labor costs in check, and inflation expectations remain contained. Still, possible increases in resource utilization, in combination with the elevated prices of energy and other commodities, have the potential to add to inflation pressures.</p>
<p>The Committee judges that some further policy firming may yet be needed to address inflation risks but emphasizes that the extent and timing of any such firming will depend importantly on the evolution of the economic outlook as implied by incoming information.</p></blockquote>
<p>For many successive meetings (i.e. most of 2004 and 2005) the Fed&#8217;s statement was almost unchanged.  But over the past two meetings the statement has decidedly evolved, and now can fairly be interpreted as signalling the end of certainty regarding further future interest rate hikes.  Put another way, while the FOMC could still raise rates a bit higher, I think that this statement now suggests that they will only do so if they get more signals that inflation is rising.  </p>
<p>Regardless of how you interpret this specific statement, however, one thing seems sure: it will be a lot more interesting (and difficult) to try to guess what the FOMC is going to do to interest rates over the next few months than it has been at any time in the past couple of years.</p>

                                <p>Well, it looks like they finally did it.  Congressional Republicans agreed yesterday on new ways to raise future taxes.  They&#8217;ve proven quite expert at cutting today&#8217;s taxes and paying for them by issuing more government debt &#8211; debt that will have to be repaid in the future through higher taxes, of course &#8211; so this comes as little surprise to most observers.  The <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/09/AR2006050900651.html">Washington Post</a> has details of this latest round of tax <strike>cuts</strike> deferrals:<br />
<blockquote><strong>GOP Reaches Deal on Tax <strike>Cuts</strike> [Deferrals]</strong></p>
<p>House and Senate Republican negotiators reached a final agreement yesterday on a five-year, nearly $70 billion tax package that would extend President Bush&#8217;s deep cuts to tax rates on dividends and capital gains, while sparing about 15 million middle-income Americans from the alternative minimum tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who gets the tax <strike>cuts</strike> deferrals?  Again, it&#8217;s pretty much par for the course that Congressional Republicans have been playing on for the past five years:<br />
<blockquote>Middle-income households would receive an average tax cut of $20 from the agreement, according to the joint Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, while 0.02 percent of households with incomes over $1 million would receive average tax cuts of $42,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, proponents argue that even if these tax <strike>cuts</strike> deferrals are extraordinarily unevenly tilted toward the super-rich, they will help to boost the economy, as they have over the past three years.  This claim that the tax cuts in dividends and capital gains are responsible for dramatic economic growth is nonsense (for details about why, see previous posts about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/capital-taxation-and-growth.html">the international evidence</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/more-on-state-of-economy.html">the strength of the post-tax cut recovery</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/budgetary-effects-of-bush-tax-cuts.html">the budgetary effects of the tax cuts</a>, or <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2005/12/rest-of-story.html">the rest of the story</a> about the Bush tax cuts), but that clearly will not stop the White House from repeating that assertion over and over:<br />
<blockquote>Republicans say those tax cuts were crucial to spurring economic growth over the past three years, by persuading more corporations to offer larger dividends and by sparking new business investment.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8221;It was as if a light switch has been thrown on,&#8221; Treasury Secretary John W. Snow said yesterday. &#8220;Rarely has a piece of public policy been so effective, with the effects so evident and immediate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some economists say the timing of those gains was coincidental. &#8220;You might credit the cuts with providing a little bit of a jump-start. But I think the main reason the economy has done so well the last couple of years has nothing to do with tax policy, and more to do with the corporate sector starting to spend some of their record profits,&#8221; said Ethan Harris, chief U.S. economist of the Lehman Brothers investment bank.</p></blockquote>
<p>One could come up with many ways to describe Secretary Snow&#8217;s &#8220;light switch&#8221; argument: specious logic; ignorant confusion of correlation with causation; deliberate simple-mindedness; or even the &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/05/2003-tax-cut-and-economic-growth.html">Donald Duck theory of economic growth</a>&#8220;.  Whichever label you choose, it is, unfortunately, also just par for the course.</p>
