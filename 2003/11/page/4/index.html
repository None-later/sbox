                                <p>Bush in the UK<br />

<p>There&#8217;s surely lots of interesting stuff for bloggers of all stripes in <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/11/16/bush_frost_int/index.html">Salon&#8217;s transcript</a> of Bush&#8217;s interview with the BBC&#8217;s David Frost. But the following juxtaposition struck me as peculiar:<br />
</p>
<p>On Iraq&#8217;s nonexistent biological weapons (<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/11/16/bush_frost_int/index1.html">page 2</a>): </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And David Kay found evidence of weapons programs. He found some biological weapons &#8211; <strong>evidence of biological weapons</strong>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>On North Korea&#8217;s nuclear weapons (<a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/11/16/bush_frost_int/index2.html">page 3</a>): </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;And I would refer people to North Korea where we&#8217;ve got a multilateral attempt to convince Kim Jong Il to get rid of his <strong>nuclear ambitions</strong> &#8230; But what I&#8217;ve done is I&#8217;ve convinced China and South Korea, and Japan, and Russia to speak with one voice to the North Koreans and say, &#8216;Get rid of your <strong>nuclear ambitions</strong>.'&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Iraq has no WMD? Then they have WMD <a href="http://www.angrybear.blogspot.com/2003_06_29_angrybear_archive.html#105726793631448323">programs</a>, or we have evidence of WMD, or perhaps evidence of WMD programs, though of course no actual WMD. <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2001786703_nkorea09.html">North Korea announces</a> that they have a nuclear deterrent ready to go, and the CIA believes the only thing stopping them from detonating a test bomb is the international backlash? That&#8217;s merely <strong>ambitions</strong>.</p>

                                <p>Clark 1, Russert 0<br />

<p>Appearing on Meet the Press with Tim Russert is basically mandatory for presidential candidates these days (though I think Bush will only do so again if he&#8217;s forced to do so by very close polls). Dean tried and didn&#8217;t do so well, though the attacks on his performance were <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh062703.shtml">largely unfair</a>. Clark, on the other hand, didn&#8217;t really seem to give much meat to his critics, and came across appearing much more knowledgeable on the issues than Russert (transcript <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/994273.asp">here</a>). Russert would throw out a quote and Clark responded ably. A quick check of the conservative National Review&#8217;s blog, <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/thecorner/corner.asp">The Corner</a>, and Instapundit support this take &#8212; neither has posts criticizing Clark&#8217;s appearance (though perhaps they are still waiting for the faxes from the RNC).</p>
<p>In any case, the following exchange was amusing and it illustrates the general give and take (and who was doing most of the taking) of the interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>MR. RUSSERT: After the war was commenced in April, you did write an article for The London Times and you said, “Can anything be more moving than the joyous throngs swarming the streets of Baghdad? Memories of the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the defeat of Milosevic in Belgrade flood back. Statues and images of Saddam are smashed and defiled. &#8230; President Bush, Tony Blair should be proud of their resolve in the face of so much doubt.”</p>
<p>GEN. CLARK: But, Tim, do you have the rest of the article with you?</p>
<p>MR. RUSSERT: I’ve read&#8230;</p>
<p>GEN. CLARK: The rest of the article you should show because what it says is: “You can have your victory parade. You can have the soldiers parade up and down. You can be proud of the fact that you commanded these troops and they crushed this Army, but you must recognize that the job isn’t done. It may be only beginning. You haven’t found the weapons of mass destruction. And you’ve got a long way to go to put anything in place in the postwar.”</p>
<p>I’m writing as a commentator. I’m fair, and I respect the men and women in the armed forces. I love them, I’ve spent my life there, and I’m proud of them. And they did, in their military duties, a fabulous job in following the orders of the commander in chief. I simply wouldn’t have given those orders at that time. Those weren’t the right orders. Diplomacy hadn’t been exhausted, we hadn’t brought our allies on board, and we didn’t have an adequate plan for what would happen next. You cannot go to war in those circumstances and be successful. In Kosovo, we had exhausted diplomacy. We had our allies on board and we had a plan for what we would do when the fighting stopped. It was exactly the opposite situation.</p>

                                <p>The Era of Big Government<br />

<p>It&#8217;s been back since around early 2001, but <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/15/politics/15ENER.html?th">here&#8217;s some more</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Authors of the bill agreed to double the use of corn-based ethanol as a gasoline additive, a provision viewed as essential to building political support among farm state legislators. As part of that deal, producers of the additive MTBE, which has been blamed for groundwater pollution in many parts of the country, would gain immunity from product liability lawsuits and the substance would be banned nationwide as of 2015. The MTBE provision was a priority of Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, and other lawmakers from Louisiana and Texas, where MTBE is produced.
<p>&#8230; Lobbyists and lawmakers said the key to passage might be the Democratic leader, Senator Tom Daschle, who has pushed the ethanol plan to benefit corn growers in his home state, South Dakota, and across the Midwest. </p>
<p>&#8230; Republican tax writers were still working out some final details Friday, and no price tag for the tax incentives was available. But the bill was expected to provide $18 billion or more in tax breaks to promote greater use of coal in power plants, to renew interest in nuclear power, to encourage oil companies to drill in deep waters in the Gulf of Mexico and to expand the generation of power through wind, among other things.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I can&#8217;t disagree <a href="http://www.matthewyglesias.com/archives/001833.html#001833">with Matt Y. &#8216;s assessment </a>of Daschle:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m going to have to do more reporting on this Monday, but my understanding is that Tom Daschle is prepared to sell the country out on a really awful bill for the sake of ethanol subsidies. </p></blockquote>

<p>Nice. In advance of his trip to London, the President found a <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/">publication</a> worthy of an interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Press secretary Scott McClellan <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43228-2003Nov14.html">broke the news</a> yesterday with nonchalance. &#8220;Good morning,&#8221; he told reporters. &#8220;The president had his usual briefings this morning and just recently completed an interview with the Sun, for a discussion of his upcoming visit to the United Kingdom.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I went to the Sun&#8217;s website and tried to find the interview, but I couldn&#8217;t because I got distracted by the Sun&#8217;s topless <a href="http://www.page3.com/index2.shtml">Page 3 Girls</a> (no adult verification required),  <a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/section/0,,5,00.html">this story</a> on &#8220;Heidi, Adriana and Tyra wing in as undie-clad angels,&#8221;  the &#8220;<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/section/0,,2001310000,00.html">Be cheeky! Touch my bum&#8230; </a>&#8221; story that had something to do with some sort of video game but was actually about pictures of &#8220;Transylvanian twins Monica and Gabriella&#8221; in short-shorts. Then I re-resolved to find the Bush article, but got distracted by &#8220;<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/section/0,,2002100003,00.html">Victoria Newton&#8217;s Bizarre Exposed</a>,&#8221; and then wandered over to &#8220;<a href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320001-2003530115,00.html">Dear Diedre</a>&#8221; to read about some poor young woman&#8217;s group-sex travails.</p>
<p>What could possibly possess Bush to grant an interview to this <strike>Newspaper</strike> tabloid and not the respectable but conservative <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/index.jhtml">Telegraph</a> or the slightly less conservative but even more respectable <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/">London Times</a>? <a href="http://www.newscorp.com/index2.html">Click here</a> to learn the answer (Hint: the same person owns Fox News and The Sun).</p>

<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://nitpicker.blogspot.com/2003_11_01_nitpicker_archive.html#106878986982436960">Via Nitpicker</a>,  I see that &#8220;[<a href="http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,7493,1082830,00.html">Bush lined</a>] up interviews with the BBC&#8217;s David Frost and the new Daily Telegraph editor Martin Newland.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Ketch-ing Up<br />

<p>Or, <em>Pouring Ketchup On An Over-cooked Campaign</em>, or <em>Ketchup Money to Help Campaign Catch Up</em>, or some sort of bad pun involving <em>Ketchup</em>, <em>money </em>and <em>catch up</em> (bonus points if you can also work &#8220;kvetch&#8221; into the pun*):</p>
<blockquote><p>Unlike Dean and Bush, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A42832-2003Nov14.html">Kerry said</a> he will put his own money into the campaign, becoming the first Democrat in at least 20 years to do so. Kerry&#8217;s wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, is worth an estimated $500 million, but Kerry can contribute only money under his control and half of what he and his wife jointly hold.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kerry could get about $18.6 m in federal matching grants if he agreed to both abide an overall $45m cap and to abide by state caps. Kerry&#8217;s sitting on $8m and raised just $4m last quarter, so it would take a lot for him exceed the $45m primary limit. </p>
<p>One of two things must be true (or both): (1) He&#8217;s willing and able to spend a lot of his wife&#8217;s money (meaning a lot of it is held jointly) or (2) <a href="http://www.fecinfo.com/nov03.pdf">New Hampshire&#8217;s spending limit</a> of $729,000 is too low for what is a make-or-break state for Kerry. Personally, I think he&#8217;s done already; but even Kerry must know that he&#8217;s really done if he loses New Hampshire by more than a small margin. Iowa is going to Gephardt or Dean so if Kerry loses NH, the <a href="http://www.vote-smart.org/election_president_state_primary_dates.php">next feasible wins</a> for him are on 2/3/04 in Delaware, New Mexico, Missouri, and North Dakota, and those only seem likely if he wins NH, or at least finishes a strong second. Even still, those wins will be offset by near-certain Kerry losses in Arizona, Oklahoma, and South Carolina on the same day.</p>
<p>Then things get better for Kerry, with Michigan, Washington, and Maine in the following week. The point: Kerry has to make it to Michigan on 2/7 with some appearance of viability. To do that he&#8217;s got to eat into Dean&#8217;s 10-12 point New Hampshire lead, and $729,000 isn&#8217;t going to do the trick. So upon reflection, this may actually not be a sign of an impendingg injection of catch-up money from Teresa Heinz&#8217;s fortune&#8211;Kerry may plan to empty his coffers in NH and then hope a win will accelerate fundraising. If so, things could turn ugly, fast.</p>

                                <p><strong>Explanations for The Jobless Recovery</strong></p>
<p>Two of the world&#8217;s leading economists publicly discussed possible reasons for the jobless recovery in the past week.  In <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/BoardDocs/Speeches/2003/200311062/default.htm">a speech on November 6</a>, Ben Bernanke, Governor of the Federal Reserve Board, articulated the argument that the main culprit is high productivity growth in the US.  On the other hand, Alan Krueger, one of the world’s leading labor economists and a professor at Princeton University, threw cold water on this explanation in a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/13/business/13scene.html">NYTimes column on November 13</a>.  Who’s right?  They both make great arguments (you should read them in full), but if you keep reading, I’ll suggest a new possibility that neither of them addressed.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a few alternative explanations for the jobless recovery:</p>
<p>1. Maybe global political and economic uncertainty is keeping firms from hiring.  The problem with this explanation? As Bernanke said: </p>
<blockquote><p>The observations that workweeks have not risen and temporary employment have risen only modestly&#8230; is a bit of evidence against the uncertainty explanation. If firms needed more labor services but were reluctant to commit to new hiring, one would expect to see them lengthening workweeks and hiring temporary workers in large numbers, measures that increase labor input but are also easier to reverse.</p></blockquote>
<p>2. Maybe high productivity growth in the US is allowing output to rise without increasing employment.  This is Bernanke’s preferred explanation: </p>
<blockquote><p>In real terms manufacturing production in the United States has risen rapidly over the past fifty years.  The recent recession has affected that trend only modestly. For example, although as of September 2003 U.S. manufacturing output was about 6 percent below its mid-2000 peak, it was also about equal to the level reached in 1999.</p>
<p>If manufacturing output has not declined in the United States, then what explains the sharp reductions in U.S. manufacturing employment?  The answer is a stellar record of productivity growth. Over the years, new technologies, processes, and products have permitted manufacturing firms to produce ever-increasing output with ever fewer workers.</p>
<p>This observation brings me to my fifth and final possible explanation of the jobless recovery, which is the remarkable increase in labor productivity we have seen in recent years, not only in manufacturing but in the economy as a whole&#8230; Although other explanations for the jobless recovery – overstaffing in the boom, benefits costs, uncertainty, and structural change&#8211;have played a role, in my view the productivity explanation is, quantitatively, probably the most important.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, Krueger disagrees with this explanation:</p>
<blockquote><p>On examination, rapid productivity growth is unlikely to account for the dismal job picture in the United States over the last two and a half years. </p>
<p>Implicitly, this view argues that for some reason there are limits to how fast the gross domestic product (that is, output of goods and services) can grow, so, by definition, faster labor productivity growth results in slower job growth&#8230; There is no reason the gross domestic product could not have grown faster once productivity accelerated. Monetary and fiscal policy have not restrained growth. </p>
<p>Second, in the United States greater job growth tends to accompany faster productivity growth, over either a quarter or a year, as well as over longer periods. [It is normal for] productivity growth to surge at the beginning of a recovery – [only] the job losses are unusual this time. Furthermore, during the second-longest jobless recovery on record, which occurred during the previous Bush administration, productivity growth was lower than it is now, so accelerating productivity is not the only potential cause of a jobless recovery.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have to admit that I find Krueger’s counterargument persuasive.  I agree that there has to be more to the story than just the high rate of productivity growth.  Such as?  Citing Larry Katz, Krueger proposes numbers 3 and 4 on our list:</p>
<p>3. “Maybe recoveries that follow longer booms have weaker job growth initially because companies postponed restructuring during the boom. Therefore, more time is needed for companies to reorganize work, which spills over into the recovery phase.”  Krueger goes on to cast doubt on this explanation, as well, however:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, the recessions in 1991 and 2001, notable for extended jobless recoveries afterward, both followed long booms. But in the eight earlier postwar recessions, longer booms were typically followed by shorter jobless recoveries, not longer ones. For example, after the recession following the 1960&#8217;s boom &#8211; the second longest, after the Clinton boom &#8211; job growth resumed immediately.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, I agree with Krueger.  I don’t think it has anything to do with the length of the boom that preceded the recession.  Krueger’s next proposed explanation is:</p>
<p>4. Maybe jobs haven’t been created because the tax cuts were directed more at savings and consumption, rather than job creation.  The problem with this idea?  Even if they weren’t explicitly directed at job creation, the tax cuts still stimulated the economy, and caused GDP to grow rapidly.  So we&#8217;re still left wondering why a growing GDP isn’t accompanied by growing employment.  Whether you subsidize the firm or the consumer through a tax cut shouldn’t matter – either way more economic activity is generated.  Also, counterexamples abound.  For example, the tax cuts of the early 1980s were also primarily in the form of reduced income taxes, yet led to a massive boom in employment.</p>
<p>So what’s my own theory?  I think that there’s a crucial clue contained in #3, which I will use to propose my own explanation&#8230;</p>
<p>5. Maybe recoveries from milder recessions take longer to generate jobs.  The two mildest recessions in postwar US history have been the two Bush recessions.  And those are the two that took the longest to start generating new jobs.  Why?  I think it’s a variant on what Krueger said in #3: in a mild recession, there’s relatively little restructuring, and relatively little firing, so the economy doesn’t have as deep a hole to climb out of.  Sharper recessions necessitate drastic actions by firms to stay alive – and those that survive are therefore strong and healthy from the very beginning of the recovery.  But a mild recession doesn’t do as much to weed out the weaker firms, so you have more firms at the beginning of the recovery that still can’t afford to hire more workers.</p>
<p>Note that I’m not at all advocating sharp recessions over mild ones – mild recessions are still definitely preferable, in my book.  But we may have to recognize that if the pain isn’t as severe, the bliss of job creation won’t be as great, either.</p>

                                <p><strong>Winning More Hearts and Minds in Iraq</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1083829,00.html">The Guardian</a> has these quotes about the CIA’s assessment of the Iraqi resistance: </p>
<blockquote><p>One military intelligence assessment now estimates the insurgents&#8217; strength at 50,000. Analysts cautioned that such a figure was speculative, but it does indicate a deep-rooted revolt on a far greater scale than the Pentagon had led the administration to believe. </p>
<p>An intelligence source in Washington familiar with the CIA report described it as a &#8220;bleak assessment that the resistance is broad, strong and getting stronger&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>As an example of why the resistance is growing, look to stories like <a href="http://www.ajc.com/news/content/news/ap/ap_story.html/Intl/AP.V1304.AP-Iraq-Civilians-.html">this one</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>FALLUJAH, Iraq (AP)&#8211;U.S. troops opened fire on a truck carrying live chickens near the tense town of Fallujah, killing five civilians aboard the vehicle, including a father and his two sons, relatives said Wednesday. </p>
<p>&#8220;They went to bring chickens &#8230; and they came back at 9 or 10 at night and we were waiting for them,&#8221; said Khalid Khalifa al-Jumaily, whose two nephews were killed on the truck. &#8220;The Americans fired on them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Add a few more to that 50,000.  Sigh.</p>

                                <p><strong>Warren Buffett&#8217;s Interesting Solution for the Trade Deficit</strong></p>
<p>Note that I call it an ‘interesting’ solution, rather than ‘sensible’ or ‘good’.  I like Buffett – he seems like a decent guy (for a billionaire) and his priorities are basically in the right place, in my opinion.  But this idea has some serious problems.</p>
<p>In an article in <a href="http://www.fortune.com/fortune/specials/2003/1110/buffett.html">Fortune magazine</a> (subscription required), Buffett says that he is extremely worried about the US trade deficit. In particular, he is worried about the fact that by running trade deficits, and thus effectively trading US assets for foreign goods and services, the US is becoming too deeply indebted to the rest of the world.  Here’s his solution:</p>
<blockquote><p>The time to halt this trading of assets for consumables is now, and I have a plan to suggest for getting it done. My remedy may sound gimmicky, and in truth it is a tariff called by another name. But this is a tariff that retains most free-market virtues, neither protecting specific industries nor punishing specific countries nor encouraging trade wars. This plan would increase our exports and might well lead to increased overall world trade. And it would balance our books without there being a significant decline in the value of the dollar, which I believe is otherwise almost certain to occur.</p>
<p>We would achieve this balance by issuing what I will call Import Certificates (ICs) to all U.S. exporters in an amount equal to the dollar value of their exports. Each exporter would, in turn, sell the ICs to parties—either exporters abroad or importers here—wanting to get goods into the U.S. To import $1 million of goods, for example, an importer would need ICs that were the byproduct of $1 million of exports. The inevitable result: trade balance.</p></blockquote>
<p>To his substantial credit, by the way, Buffett began his piece with a disclaimer, acknowledging that he is not an economist and does not have a good record of macroeconomic forecasting.</p>
<p>But what about the substance of his suggestion?  I find it fascinating to consider.</p>
<p>He’s basically completely right in everything he says.  The US is indeed becoming more indebted to the rest of the world with every passing day.  He’s also right that his plan would very quickly eliminate the US’s trade deficit.  And he’s right when he says that his proposed solution functions essentially like an across-the-board tariff, though he doesn’t mention that it’s a peculiar type of tariff with the revenues being transferred directly into across-the-board export subsidies.  It’s actually an extremely elegant way to simultaneously and uniformly tax imports and subsidize exports.</p>
<p>Now what about the question of whether it’s a good idea?  Put aside the fact that it would be grossly illegal under WTO rules, and would therefore probably require the US to exit the WTO altogether.  The problem is while he’s right that the trade gap is problematic in the long run, in the short run its a good thing.  In this, it’s very much like the paradox of thrift.</p>
<p>In other words, there are substantial benefits to the US trade deficit in the short run.  In particular, the trade deficit allows the US to have higher business investment (in addition to consumption) than it would otherwise.  Without it, therefore, US firms would be investing in less productive capacity, making the US economy grow more slowly, be less productive, and therefore have lower wages over time.</p>
<p>Another problem is that without a trade deficit, the US would (by definition) no longer be attracting net capital flows.  All of the money that is currently flowing into the US to purchase US assets would go elsewhere.  This would probably lead to a substantial drop in asset prices.  The stock market would fall, interest rates would have to rise sharply, and real estate prices would tumble.</p>
<p>His plan would also probably create all sorts of temporarily perverse incentives during its implementation, would wreak havoc on international financial markets, would lead to a sharp bout of inflation for the US, and probably cause a few other problems as well. </p>
<p>And yet, I completely agree with Buffett’s worries about the long-run implications of the US trade deficit.  So while I can’t endorse Buffett’s solution, I’m sympathetic to his goals.  As an alternative, I can repeat the tired old prescription of “higher savings, lower consumption” in the US – but that’s not really something that a policy-maker can do much about.  So I have to admit that I don’t have a good solution of my own to offer.  I wish I did.</p>

                                <p><strong>Bush Takes Advice from France</strong></p>
<p>From today’s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/13/politics/13PREX.html?hp">NYTimes</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 — The Bush administration, moving up its timetable for self-government in Iraq and yielding to its own handpicked leadership there, has decided to try to hold elections in the first half of next year and turn civilian authority over to a temporary government before a new constitution is written, administration officials said Wednesday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn’t this exactly what the French have been advocating for the past several months?  Let’s look back in time and see.  From <a href="http://www.economist.com/agenda/displaystory.cfm?story_id=2081661">The Economist</a>, September 19, 2003: </p>
<blockquote><p>France wants the UN to play a bigger role in rebuilding Iraq. France is also agitating for self-government for Iraqis as quickly as possible. Mr Chirac has urged America to allow a provisional Iraqi government—more powerful than the American-backed all-Iraqi Governing Council—to take over [within months], with elections to follow next spring. America thinks this is ridiculous—it would, Washington argues, mean handing power to Iraqis before they are ready, and thus consigning the country to more chaos.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, this doesn’t mean that the Bush administration has changed its mind.  It always intended things to be this way, right?  Because Team Bush never makes mistakes.</p>
