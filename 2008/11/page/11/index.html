<p>From the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/08/business/yourmoney/08money.html?em">NYT</a> business section comes this editotial,(the last half):</p>
<blockquote><p>Will we have to bail out our own family members?</p>
<p>It’s started coming up in asides I hear from middle-aged friends who are concerned about their parents ending up in the poorhouse. And I see it in e-mail from people in their 60s and 70s, who can’t believe their offspring got mixed up in funny mortgages and wallets full of credit cards.</p>
<p>But often, the grown children don’t know precisely how the devastation in the markets has affected their parents’ portfolio, and the older parents don’t know what their children’s monthly debt payments are.</p>
<p>None of this is fun to think about. And if you dare to open your mouth about it, relatives may take offense. Silence, however, is good for no one. You don’t want to be blindsided months or years from now by a family member in desperate straits, nor do you want to worry yourself sick when there’s no reason to.</p>
<p>So this week, please consider starting an intergenerational conversation about money, perhaps in writing, which might reduce the risk of a knee-jerk response that leads to an argument. I’ve suggested an approach below, for an e-mail message or letter to a parent and a possible reply, though you could easily tweak it if you’re initiating the chat with your child.</p>
<p>You’ll probably have your own ideas about how to approach this conversation, or some lessons learned from discussions that went awry. If so, please post them in the article comments section of this story.</p></blockquote>

<p>Not Veteran&#8217;s Day, which is a U.S. construction to make certain we don&#8217;t have to give another Federal holiday to Those Who Served.  And arguably not Remembrance Day, the version here in Canada, since (<a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/11/armistice-day.html">as Rob[ert] Farley notes</a>) there are &#8220;only&#8221; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surviving_veterans_of_World_War_I">ten known survivors remaining</a> of The War to End All Wars, which ended ninety (90) years ago today. (Ten is pretty good, if you think about it; the youngest two are 107.)</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s talk, in broad terms, about why it was not The War to End All Wars, why remembrance of mustard gas and Verdun and the Somme didn&#8217;t cause everyone to realize we never wanted to do it again, at any price.</p>
<p>As I said, we&#8217;re using wide brush strokes here, and this is an economics blog.  SO let&#8217;s talk about the Treaty of Versailles.</p>
<p>The U.S. was in the War to End All Wars for just over 18 months (6 April 1917 &#8211; 11 November 1918). For the time running up to the declaration of war, they sold equipment to both sides. Not necessarily equally, and maybe at a reduced pace to the German side after <a href="http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/snpwwi2.htm">7 May 1915</a>, but there was commerce going on. (Same story in World War II, as followers of <a href="http://reformed-theology.org/html/books/wall_street/chapter_06.htm">Henry Ford&#8217;s career</a> know all too well.)</p>
<p>France, by contrast, <a href="http://www.creators.com/opinion/molly-ivins/molly-ivins-february-18.html">lost 1,400,000 soldiers in that war</a>.  There is a generation taken from the country, and a country to rebuild without those on whose backs such building usually occurs.</p>
<p>Can anyone wonder that France wanted the Germans penalized to the extent that they would not be able to support an armed force again?  There would be no one to fight.*</p>
<p>And yet all one ever hears is the John Maynard Keyneses and Bernard Baruchs decrying the terms of the Treaty—how they were unfair <em>to Germany</em>.</p>
<p>And the subsequent talk has all been about how Keynes and Baruch and the others were correct, and it was a mean, evil thing to make poor Germany suffer after they destroyed the breeding-age male population (and then some) of another country.  From that perspective, it is difficult to imagine a different Treaty being agreed, since anything less penurious would make France worse off, and therefore not be even weakly Pareto-optimal.</p>
<p>Which is where we turn this into an economics post.</p>
<p>Because there is a way to improve the solution:  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compensating_variation">Compensating Variation</a>. Everyone&#8217;s lot is improved by some reallocations.  And while Hicks does the mathematics in 1939, it isn&#8217;t as if such a general pattern cannot be seen on the schoolyards of Flanders and Eton.</p>
<p>In this case, the United States was the clear winner of the War to End All Wars.  THe British did not suffer so much as the French.  And in both cases, prominent public officials (Baruch from the United States, Keynes from Britain) spoke out about the Treaty, forcing one to the suspicion*** that leaders in both countries suspected from the start that the terms were penurious, and would lead to resentment among the German people.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Compensating Variation. Why would not the U.S. and the U.K. (such as it were) not be offering aid to France, in exchange for terms in the Treaty of Versailles that would lessen the likelihood that <a href="http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=history/firstwar/vimy/vimy1a">Flanders Field</a> would again be invoked?</p>
<p>The next time someone tells you that all will be well when a Treaty is executed, because all we need is that some of the winners offer compensating variation to the losers, ask them why Armistice Day now must honor not only its own dead, but also the dead of the wars that followed The War to End All Wars.</p>
<p>*And, indeed, the demographics corroborate this. In 1940, the total population of France is 42 million people.  The population of Germany and Austria is 78 million. 1.86 to 1. More significantly, the Armed Forces of the respective countries stand at 4.6 and 17.9 million: 3.9 to 1.</p>
<p>The result is inevitable:  the French have more civilian casualties (470K) than the U.S. does military ones (405K).**</p>
<p>**Canada, by the way, loses 3.57% of its military force in World War II: more by percentage than France, the U.S., Australia, or the Netherlands.</p>
<p>***I said I&#8217;m talking broad strokes here, but the 1919 publication of <em><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/15776">The Economic Consequences of the Peace</a></em> and the necessity of publishing <em><a href="http://www.questia.com/read/1468872?title=The%20Making%20of%20the%20Reparation%20and%20Economic%20Sections%20of%20the%20Treaty">The Making of the Reparation and Economic Sections of the Treaty</a></em> in 1920 makes it clear that the arguments over the harshness of the treaty were contemporaneous. (Baruch, in fairness, was one of the negotiators of the Treaty, and only later became discouraged as he saw both how the results were handled, and how Ford maligned and slimed him while profiteering.</p>

<p>Consider this a bright, cheerful post, as opposed to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/winners-compensate-losers-thoughts-on.html">my next one</a>.</p>
<p>As long as <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=11&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=class_based_aa_in_hiring#110842">TAPPED is talking about &#8220;classism,&#8221;</a> let&#8217;s recall that the easy solution was Common Knowledge <a href="http://www.cowboylyrics.com/lyrics/williams-don/good-ole-boys-like-me-10625.html">by the early 1980s</a>:<br />
<blockquote>When I was in school I ran with kid down the street<br />But I watched him burn himself up on bourbon and speed<br />But I was smarter than most and I could choose<br />Learned to talk like the man on the six o&#8217;clock news</p></blockquote>
<p>
<p>Always keep in mind, of course, that a thick accent comes in handy, especially if you&#8217;re trying to be underestimated. But that&#8217;s not generally in the first round.</p>

<p>A great deal of ink and untold pixels have been expended &#8216;explaining&#8217; why a real majority in the Senate requires enough votes to shut down a filibuster, i.e. sixty. And in that vein people are eagerly following the races in Alaska, Georgia and <s>Wisconsin</s>Minnesota hoping all three will break the Democrats way and fretting that the Dems can&#8217;t afford to boot Lieberman if by some chance lightning does strike. Well I suggest this ignores the actual way filibusters actually played out in the 110th Congress. Rather than being a constitutional issue or even strictly a political issue instead the filibuster was used primarily for its public relations power in allowing Republicans to present themselves as stewards of civility and compromise while pinning Democrats as political grand standers. Well that dog won&#8217;t hunt anymore. But to see why we have to look at the actual mechanics of the filibuster in the last Congress.</p>
<p>It all depended on moving the goalposts from 51 votes to 67 (sic). Step one: get President Bush to threaten a veto. It didn&#8217;t really matter if this threat was in real terms serious, it just had to be out there. What it did is allow Republican Senators to make the claim that any attempt by the Democrats to move legislation that did not have enough votes to overturn the veto was just a time-wasting PR move. If Republicans did relent and allow the legislation through the only result would be a veto and the return of that bill to the Senate for some compromise. So why bother? Instead get the Dems to admit that they didn&#8217;t have even 60 immediate votes to close debate and so force them to compromise anyway. Under this framing any Republican filibuster was simply a time saving move in the ultimate interest of getting signable legislation accomplished. And more to the point any attempt by Democrats to put Republicans on the spot by forcing them to actually engage in prolonged debate simply illustrated how non-serious the Democrats were in actually governing.</p>
<p>But this strategy all falls to pieces if you don&#8217;t have the backup of a Presidential veto. If instead you have a bill with strong support of the House, a solid majority of the Senate and expressed willingness by a Democratic President to sign it there is no way to spin a filibuster as some time-saving way of getting to an inevitable compromise. Instead it is exposed for what it really was all along-a naked attempt by the minority to shut down progress supported by the majority. Institutionally there is no difference,  but it is night and day on the public relations front. In particular it strips all cover from remaining Republican moderates. In the last Congress they could make a plausible CYA explanation that they were just acknowledging the reality of the Presidential veto, that it wasn&#8217;t the fortieth vote to sustain the filibuster that mattered but instead the thirty-fourth vote that would uphold the (theoretical) veto. In this Congress that loincloth just got stripped away.</p>
<p>From a Democratic perspective it would be useful to achieve a filibuster-proof sixty vote majority, and particularly when it comes to such vital matters as new Supreme Court justices. It might even be reason enough to tolerate a mild level of blackmail by Lieberman to keep him nominally in the caucus. But the oft expressed notion that the Republicans can simply filibuster anything and everything in the way they did in the last Congress simply does not survive exposure to the actual political and public relations process as it will play out with a Democratic President backing up a Democratic Senate. Because in the end that goal line has been moved back from 67 to 51 and the filibuster has been reduced to what in football terms is known as the Prevent Defense. And as every good football fan knows the only thing the Prevent Defense prevents is victory, and tends to piss off the fans all at the same time.</p>
<p>So root, root, root that Stevens, Coleman and most especially the thoroughly despicable Chambliss get kicked to the curb over the next few weeks. Just don&#8217;t spend time worrying that the entire Obama/Democratic agenda depends on reaching 60 votes in the Senate. The dynamics have changed and Republicans no longer have the PR cover they did when Bush&#8217;s veto pen floated in the background.</p>

<p>Last week I published this map of the counties that voted more republican this presidential election and called it the US poverty belt.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SRMXk9PBQAI/AAAAAAAAAjw/Phg3F7gXd6Y/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SRMXk9PBQAI/AAAAAAAAAjw/Phg3F7gXd6Y/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Some readers strongly disagreed.</p>
<p>But it seems that at least the New York Times agrees with my analysis.</p>
<p>This week <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/us/politics/11south.html?hp">they published</a><br /><strong>For South, a Waning Hold on Politics</strong></p>
<p>One of the key points in Today&#8217;s article states:</p>
<p>Southern counties that voted more heavily Republican this year than in 2004 tended to be poorer, less educated and whiter, a statistical analysis by The New York Times shows. Mr. Obama won in only 44 counties in the Appalachian belt, a stretch of 410 counties that runs from New York to Mississippi. Many of those counties, rural and isolated, have been less exposed to the diversity, educational achievement and economic progress experienced by more prosperous areas.</p>
<p>In the accompanying table one of the key points showed    the more the shift towards republican the more likely the county was likely to have a larger share of its population with an income below $30,000. The counties that went more republican by at least 10 points have over 50% of their population with an income of under $30,000.</p>

<p>If you right click on the table you can see some comparisons not now visible.</p>
<p>The other point I did not comment on last week is that the second US poverty belt located in the South&#8211;western Desert of the US also voted more republican.</p>

<p>Reg•Watch has been following the phenomenon known as &#8220;midnight regulation&#8221; where an administration finalizes lots of rules in its waning days of power. Below is a list of many of the more controversial rules worth watching. Reg•Watch will provide regular updates to this list.</p>
<p>(Here is the permanent link in case you want to bookmark it: www.ombwatch.org/article/blogs/entry/5494.</p></blockquote>
<p>President-elect Obama has had a team of over 40 people working on this for the last few months, and to write alternative regs or recommendations deemed necessary, or suggest laws to Congress.  What an organization he runs!</p>

<p>Troll. Troll. Trooooooolllll. And Later: &#8220;Unscientic Politically Motivated Biased Censoring.&#8221;</p>
<p>I think its safe to point out that Dan, who runs Angry Bear on a day to day basis, has wrestled with the idea of what to do with trolls.  Here at AB, there are plenty of readers/commenters with plenty of opinions, some of whom have very different beliefs than the regular writers of the blog.  But most of those folks make the blog better and more informative; we really only have a few active trolls.</p>
<p>Now, Dan has tried a number of remedies, from moderating comments, to banning certain IP addresses.  But trolls resist counter-measures and come back even after they&#8217;ve concluded they&#8217;re not welcome.</p>
<p>At this point, a word about what constitutes a troll.  I&#8217;m not sure, but I think what makes someone a troll is the whole bit about resisting counter-measures and coming back after they&#8217;ve concluded they&#8217;re not welcome.  For what its worth, I&#8217;ve clearly been banned from the comments section of a certain econ blog.  I found it surprising – while the site is clearly on the right side of the political spectrum, the site owner and I corresponded a few times over the years, and just about every comment I left at his site provided at least one link to data.  Often, the site owner would e-mail me a personal response when I posted comments, and sometimes we&#8217;d go back and forth for a while.  But then, it stopped.  And when I realized that neither I nor my links to data were welcome, I stopped coming back.  And yes, I can change my IP address too if I feel like it, or disguise myself as someone else.  But time is limited, and I&#8217;ve got too much to do to show up and talk with people who don&#8217;t want anything to do with me and find links to data to be offensive. </p>
<p>Besides, as Bruce Webb has pointed out, this isn&#8217;t a free speech issue:  you have the right to say anything you want, but you don&#8217;t have the right to say it in someone else&#8217;s living room unless they give you permission.  Right now, this is Dan&#8217;s living room.  If he boots your IP address, he&#8217;s telling you to get the $#%^ off his property.  </p>
<p>So what do you do about people who think differently?  Well,  its always useful to understand what motivates people.  I think what trolls want is to elicit responses and to disrupt the conversation.  </p>
<p>Now, let me change gears.  Let me tell you about an individual who couldn&#8217;t possibly be a troll.  Sure, Dan and some of the other Angry Bears tried to get him out of the living room a few times, but of course, that was their bad.  A guy like this one is always welcome everywhere, but the rest of us truly aren&#8217;t worthy of his wisdom.  Now, I won&#8217;t mention any names, and if you post a comment on this thread, I&#8217;d appreciate if you don&#8217;t either.  Let&#8217;s keep everything on the up and up.  </p>
<p>Anyhow, let me excerpt from an exchange I had with this particular gentleman over the weekend.  It took place in the comments section of a post I wrote <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/warning-to-obama-and-to-rest-of-us.html">noting some of the warning signs that told us GW was going to be a failure</a>, in particular, that they relied on crazy wishful thinking (i.e., double digit economic growth) and treated that as an economic plan.  I also stated we should keep our eyes peeled for those signs with Obama, and if we saw such problems, it was our duty to speak up, rather than do what Hubbard or Mankiw did for GW and defend them. </p>
<p>The gentleman&#8217;s first comment (11.07.08 &#8211; 12:30 pm) was to tell us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bill Clinton&#8217;s claim to an economic legacy rests with his claim that he set out to balance the budget, succeeded, and this led to lower interest rates which led to the economic expansion in the 1990s. Yet when we look at 10 year treasuries the highest rate in the Bush years are lower then the lowest rates in the Clinton years. </p></blockquote>
<p>He then gave us ten year treasury figures.</p>
<p>I was busy, sadly, when I arrived, I was less than polite.  This gentleman has schooled me on the fine arts of etiquette and logic in the past, and it doesn&#8217;t always stick with me &#8211; I get too excited when I see him posting knowing the experience that will follow.  Anyway, here was my response  (11.07.08 &#8211; 6:30 pm):</p>
<blockquote><p>As to whatever you were trying to peddle upthread with respect to treasury rates and Bill Clinton and paying down the debt (whatever the heck that has to do with the post I don&#8217;t know), why don&#8217;t you check the correlation between the 10 year treasuries and the fed funds rate, and then compare that to the correlation between the treasuries and the size of the deficit? </p></blockquote>
<p>In other words &#8211; I made it clear his point didn&#8217;t seem to have much to do with the topic of the post, but that besides that, it was also pretty irrelevant.  </p>
<p>Proving himself extremely untrollish, as he would through much of the exchange that followed, the gentleman responded quickly  (11.07.08 &#8211; 7:01 pm):</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the 10 year treasury bond is a better base instrument for long term investments and the numbers say interest rates were lower under Bush then under Clinton. Under Bush the federal debt went up and interest rates went down. Clinton&#8217;s claim that the falling interest rates caused the economic upturn that kept him in office following his impeachment is just not supported by the data. Again, treasury bonds &#8212; the common benchmark were lower under Bush. </p></blockquote>
<p>Notice the dexterity with which he ignores my response completely.  Notice the grace with which he repeats himself.  </p>
<p>Once again, I responded many hours later, noting (11.08.08 &#8211; 6:15 am) that a) I had already pointed out the problem with the strawman he was so graciously trying to assign me, and b) asking once again what his comment had to do with the topic of the post.  I&#8217;m kinda dense that way.</p>
<p>The gentleman in question is nothing if not quick on the draw, and kind enough to persist when trying to alleviate the ignorance of his inferiors  (11.08.08 &#8211; 8:55 am)</p>
<blockquote><p>You blame the economic downturn on Bush and suggest that he had bad economic policies that led to the slowdown. Yet you can&#8217;t point to anything. Interest rates were lower and oversight of business was higher in the last 8 years then during the 1990s. </p></blockquote>
<p>An argument like this is as fine as anything you might find deposited inside your shoe on a cold day if you happen to have cats.  Or on a warm day.  Come to think of it, neither the argument nor the quality of said deposits are affected by the weather.  But I digress.  In any case, an argument like this (or a feline regurgitation) gains a certain something with frequent repetition, and the pattern went on.  And on.  And on.  </p>
<p>Here he was, much later (11.08.08 &#8211; 9:41 pm):</p>
<blockquote><p>The argument against Bush and taxes goes like this. Bush lowered taxes which raised the debt that caused interest rates to rise increasing required rates of return and depressing investment. But interest rates fell under Bush so you lose the point. </p>
<p>Typing fast or slow does not change the fact that you&#8217;re a data miner trying rationalize a cause. </p></blockquote>
<p>I tried once more to explain my mental feebleness, that I was not one of those enlightened folks who made the argument he felt I should have been wise enough to make in order for him to then alleviate my ignorance by disproving that particular argument.  </p>
<p>Given the gentleman&#8217;s laser focus, I tried to find common ground from another angle:</p>
<blockquote><p>But we try to be helpful here at Angry Bear, so let me suggest a solution. Since you&#8217;ve convinced yourself that I am some sort of a spokesman for a theory I have never mentioned and have never believed in, why not also convince yourself I am now abasing myself for having realized that this theory I have never mentioned and have never believed in is wrong. You should find it satisfying. </p></blockquote>
<p>Sadly, that wouldn&#8217;t do.  His response was that I couldn&#8217;t  explain what went wrong with during the administration because (get this!) interest rates were lower under the GW administration than under Clinton.  I know, I would never have imagined that &#8211; thank goodness he was around to tell me yet again that interest rates were lower GW.  I would never have guessed.  </p>
<p>I then committed the ultimate faux pas.  I provided links to a number of posts I wrote which provided explanations for the difference between the performance of Republican and Democratic presidents, at least one of which looked at GW in particular.  Somehow, I believe in all of those posts I might have failed to mention &#8220;interest rates&#8221; &#8211; which would make me just as bad as Bob Dole in his speech accepting the Republican Party&#8217;s nomination for President in 1996, George Bush his speech accepting the Republican Party&#8217;s nomination for President in 2000, George Bush in his speech accepting the Republican Party&#8217;s nomination (again) in 2004, and John McCain accepting the Republican Party&#8217;s nomination for President in 2008.  I clearly failed to treat a very Republican issue seriously, instead grasping at straws like tax cuts and &#8220;small&#8221; government.</p>
<p>Which, apparently just goes to prove my nefariousness.  Or is that nefariousity?  Regardless, I am ashamed to say it was too much of an offense against the sensibilities of a gentleman (11.09.08 &#8211; 3:11 pm):</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not going to chase your posts around. I pointed out that interests rates were lower under Bush, provided the data, and provided a link in case you wanted to verify the data. The post was self contained. </p>
<p>I suppose with all your data mining you also looked at interest rates under different presidents but because they are lower today under Bush then under then the three presidents that preceded him it does not make the case you like so you don&#8217;t present it. See, I understand your trick, you search all combinations of data and you censor the ones that don&#8217;t make your case and present the ones that do. You fall down on causality though since your method is characterized by unscientic politically motivated biased censoring. </p></blockquote>
<p>See &#8211; unfailingly polite to the end.  He was kind enough to note that he would ignore the posts I had spent a lot of time writing, and would have to conclude that I didn&#8217;t dig in like a tick on an issue irrelevant to most Republicans because I had engaged in &#8220;unscientic politically motivated biased censoring.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Now, you may be wondering why I went through this, when I&#8217;m too ignorant to fully internalize the fact that I was supposed to be arguing that&#8230; well, if you&#8217;ve read so far, you know what I was supposed to be arguing.  Its simple.  See, if the learned gentleman deigns to once again attempt to dispel my ignorance, whether the issue is interest rates or tax cuts or pyramid power or even the mighty fish people of Mulgar, well, what he has to say just doesn&#8217;t fit in my poor ignorant head.  But I&#8217;d hate to be impolite, and not respond to him, so I&#8217;ll do it the only way I can &#8211; by linking to this post and mentioning that I am only capable of &#8220;unscientic politically motivated biased censoring.&#8221;  Perhaps eventually he&#8217;ll transcend to a higher plane where there are others of his kind.<br />_________________________________</p>

<p>I would prefer not to talk about AIG, especially since we already have two posts on it today: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/shopping-for-regulators.html">Robert brilliantly puts it into context</a>, while <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/fyi-aigs-new-money-deal.html">DOLB goes for blood</a>.</p>
<p>But the <s>Gorgeous, Brilliant, and Talented Bess</s>Normally-not-this-astute-or-succinct Equity Private posted <a href="http://dealbreaker.com/2008/11/this-deals-getting-worse-all-t.php">the perfect summary</a>.</p>
<p>And Floyd Norris is on fire as to why <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/more-aig/">this move</a>, with <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/unbelievable-words-from-aig/">the pathetic, lying excuse for corporate leadership the company now has</a>, makes anyone taking out the perpetrators guilty of nothing more than Justifiable Homicide (not that I&#8217;m suggesting that; far from it*).</p>
<p>Clearly, the kleptocrats at the White House and Department of the Treasury are making certain that their lamest two months and ten days make the previous eight years appear to be the epitome of frugality.</p>
<p>*I&#8217;m thinking of something longer and slower, like public stockades.</p>
