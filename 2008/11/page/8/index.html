<p>I was wondering why Mr. Spitzer had not been heard from?  Was his personal indiscretion so great that his knowledge and expertise would not trump such?  </p>
<p>He has an opinion at the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/13/AR2008111303634.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">Washington Post yesterday</a>. </p>
<blockquote><p>The new president&#8217;s team must soon get to the root causes of the mistakes that have brought us to the economic precipice. Yes, we have all derided the explosion of leverage, the failure to regulate derivatives, the flood of subprime lending that was bound to default and the excesses of CEO compensation. But these are all mere manifestations of three deeper structural problems that require greater attention: misconceptions about what a &#8220;free market&#8221; really is, a continuing breakdown in corporate governance and an antiquated and incoherent federal financial regulatory framework.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>One of the great advantages U.S. capital markets have enjoyed over the decades has been the view &#8212; held worldwide &#8212; that there was an underlying integrity to the representations market participants made, because the regulatory framework in which they were made was believed to provide genuine oversight. But as we all know, the laws requiring such integrity are meaningless without a government dedicated to enforcing them. </p>
<p>We do not need additional fragmented areas of federal regulation to handle hedge funds, sovereign wealth funds or derivatives. We need a unified approach that addresses the underlying issues: what kinds of leverage we wish to tolerate, how to measure risk, how much disclosure various trading products should provide.</p>
<p>Three overarching priorities should guide government actions in the new structure. First, we need better control of systemic risk.<br />Second, investors must be protected with adequate, accurate information. Firms must offer transparency both to individual investors and to government regulators. <br />[third]&#8230;we will have to step back from the current environment in which government has become a guarantor of all major risk. The so-called moral hazard will serve to devalue risk in the market, and this too will have a debilitating long-term effect on capital flows. Only if private actors have to bear the real risks they incur will the market function properly. We are now perilously close to nationalizing risk.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Robert Waldmann (stolen wholesale from his website by someone)</p>
<p><a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2008/11/media-matters-by-by-jamison-foser-foser.html">Media Matters by Jamison Foser</a></p>
<p>Foser has a devastating critique of, well the interpretation of a PEJ study. He says that the press (Howard Kurtz of course) has accepted the claim that coverage was biased in favor of Obama, based on the clear liberal bias of the fact, in this case including polls.</p>
<p>I steal much of his post, because I think he buried the lede.</p>
<p>    Unfortunately, the conservative complaints got some superficial support from a recent study by the Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ) that claimed that John McCain has received much more &#8220;negative&#8221; coverage than Barack Obama during the campaign.</p>
<p>    The PEJ study quickly got significant attention from the establishment media and blogs.</p>
<p>    But while the study lends rhetorical support to the conservatives&#8217; arguments, it is nearly useless as an actual assessment of how the media covered the campaign.</p>
<p>    First off, it is worth noting this little nugget about the study&#8217;s methodology, buried at the end of the PEJ report: &#8220;Talk radio stories &#8230; were not included in this campaign study of tone.&#8221; PEJ offers no justification for the exclusion of talk radio. Not a word. In what surely must be a coincidence, talk radio skews further to the right than any other medium.</p>
<p>    Now, here&#8217;s PEJ&#8217;s description of how it assesses whether a news report is &#8220;positive&#8221; or &#8220;negative&#8221;:</p>
<p>    To examine tone, the Project takes a particularly cautious and conservative approach. Unlike some researchers, we examine not just whether assertions in stories are positive or negative, but also whether they are inherently neutral. This, we believe, provides a much clearer and fairer sense of the tone of coverage than ignoring those balanced or mixed evaluations. Second, we do not simply tally up all the evaluative assertions in stories and compile them into a single pile to measure. Journalists and audiences think about press coverage in stories or segments. They ask themselves, is this story positive or negative or neutral? Hence the Project measures coverage by story, and for a story to be deemed as having a negative or positive tone, it must be clearly so, not a close call: for example, the negative assertions in a story must outweigh positive assertions by a margin of at least 1.5 to 1 for that story to be deemed negative.</p>
<p>    OK &#8230; anyone want to guess what that means in practical terms?</p>
<p>    Unfortunately, the few actual examples of &#8220;positive&#8221; and &#8220;negative&#8221; coverage PEJ offers do little to clarify its methodology, and less to inspire confidence. For example, PEJ notes:</p>
<p>    Some of that positive coverage was related to evidence that the financial crisis was aiding Obama. &#8220;Recent economic woes have given Democrat Barack Obama a clear lead over Republican John McCain,&#8221; declared a story posted on AOL News on Sept. 24, citing a 9-point lead for Obama in a new Washington Post/ABC News poll.</p>
<p>    That&#8217;s what counts as &#8220;positive&#8221; coverage of Obama? A fairly straightforward report that a poll finds Obama in a &#8220;clear lead&#8221; over McCain? And, it seems, much of Obama&#8217;s &#8220;positive&#8221; coverage consisted of reports like that:</p>
<p>    The data clearly point in this direction for some of the explanation. Of those stories that focused mostly on polls, a clear majority (57%) were positive for Obama, while less than a quarter (23%) were negative. Similarly, stories about the electoral map, swing states and campaign strategy were even more favorable (77% positive vs. 6% negative). These represent the most positive element of Obama&#8217;s coverage.</p>
<p>    So, if a candidate is winning, and the polls show that, and the media report that the polls show the candidate winning, that counts as &#8220;positive&#8221; coverage. Well, OK, it&#8217;s true that such a story is &#8220;positive,&#8221; but it tells us nearly nothing about the media.<br />__________________________________<br />by Robert Waldmann</p>

<p>Recovery vehicle? Who knows.</p>
<p>I know this, whatever it is won&#8217;t work. This systemic failure was baked into the cake years ago. It was unsustainable form the start. The only question was how long will it last.</p>
<p>I laughed out loud yesterday when I heard an NPR interview with Paulson where he said &#8220;They were trying to get people BORROWING again.&#8221;</p>
<p>Think about that. We are experiencing the blowback of overborrowing and these geniuses think we should borrow MORE??!!</p>
<p>They just act like all the wealth BELONGS to the few (given by God of course) and the rest of us just need to rent it from them. They want to pay just enough salary for us to be able to rent all the things they make available and not a penny more.</p>
<p>Until someone exposes this fallacy of the system ( and although I enthusiastically supported Obama because he is light years better than the entrenched wealth republicans, I&#8217;m not sure Obama will make any headway along these lines)<br />we will continue to be stricken with &#8220;business cycles&#8221; which really just reflect the schizophrenic wants and needs of the investor class as they &#8220;chase&#8221; ever elusive double digit returns.</p>
<p>Most people I know want to work, work a full days work, earn a living commensurate to their talents and effort and go home, recreate, (or procreate) sleep and do it again. They&#8217;ll do it for fifty years if its a job they have chosen.<br />The idea that people who recognize the abject absurdity of the current debt driven model, sustained by supply side mumbo jumbo are somehow in favor of a Soviet style central economy where you pretend to work and we&#8217;ll pretend to pay you, is absurd.</p>
<p>These false dichotomies that get thrown about are just ridiculous. You don&#8217;t have to back the current model with all its warts to be a CAPITALIST. There is a better way to do what we have given our investment class the responsibility of doing. I would not want to be put in charge of setting it up but I know I would start with a maxim. You get paid for work, not for gambling with other peoples money. Gambling with your own money is fine but placing my life savings at risk because you want a side bet with some high roller in London on whether or not some homeowner in Detroit is gonna default on his loan SHOULD be a crime. It should also be punishable by what ever our society deems is the maximum penalty for a crime. There is nothing socially redeemable about this activity.<br />____________________________<br /> by reader Greg in comments</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_11_16_archive.html#3847882183236518331">Dr. Black</a>, the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/17/business/17auto.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=print">NYT quotes the Alabama Senator</a>:<br />
<blockquote>“Companies fail every day and others take their place. I think this is a road we should not go down,” said Mr. Shelby, the senior Republican on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>“They’re not building the right products,” he said. “They’ve got good workers, but I don’t believe they’ve got good management. They don’t innovate. They’re a dinosaur in a sense.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The first sentence (&#8220;Companies fail every day and others take their place.&#8221;) is clearly true.  I believe we refer to this as &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; if we are feeling positive.</p>
<p>The second sentence (&#8220;I think this is a road we should not go down&#8221;) is clearly a lie, since they have gone down that road with AIG, The Hartford, and several other firms.</p>
<p>The next four sentences are subject to interpretation, but let us assume the first two (“They’re not building the right products,” he said. “They’ve got good workers, but I don’t believe they’ve got good management.&#8221;) are true, while leaving the third (&#8220;They don’t innovate.&#8221;) as an exercise for Tom* and the fourth as beyond the pale, even if you assume all of the above.</p>
<p>So we have, in the words of Richard Shelby:
<ol>
<li>Bad management, selecting</li>
<li>the wrong products, being made by</li>
<li>Good workers.</li>
</ol>
<p>So what is the solution Shelby proposes?</p>
<p>Defenestrate the workers. (Is anyone surprised that <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/11/the-wisdom-of-b.html">Tyler Cowen</a>, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/11/bruce-bartlett.html">Bruce Bartlett</a>, and <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/11/cost-differences.html">Greg Mankiw</a> appear to endorse this idea?)</p>
<p>The strange thing is that if you follow Mankiw&#8217;s link into CATO-land, you find the &#8220;dinosaurs&#8221; argument <a href="http://www.autoobserver.com/2007/05/harbour-toyota-most-productive----by-a-hair.html">falling apart</a>:
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SSE83bzN2EI/AAAAAAAAAOU/xvxnHEIFszY/s1600-h/Auto+Maker+Productivity.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SSE83bzN2EI/AAAAAAAAAOU/xvxnHEIFszY/s400/Auto+Maker+Productivity.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />As the article accompanying this table notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two significant factors jump out of the data: the gap among the six is narrowing – the narrowest margin since the study began in 1989; and the domestics, albeit they had the most improvement required, have made dramatic progress.</p>
<p>The gap in 2007 is a scant five labor hours, roughly, from No. 6 Ford to No. 1 Toyota. Harbour [Consulting] said that amounts to no more than a $250 to $300 per vehicle cost disadvantage to the domestics.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the workers are (in general) performing better and even the complete cf that is F is not severely underperforming the market (though its moves in the past five years have borne a rather bitter fruit, judging by the production numbers).</p>
<p>In short, the work is being done, and being done well.  It&#8217;s the management that has, for the past 25-plus years, misallocated funds to itself.  Looks as if it&#8217;s an industry that is a prime candidate for a bailout that puts a tight lease on the self-indulgent management.  What&#8217;s the phrase, &#8220;<a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/politicsNews/idUSTRE4A66VT20081113">auto czar</a>&#8220;?</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s even ignoring any <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/16/opinion/16clark.html?pagewanted=print">national security considerations</a> (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/11/whats-good-for.html">Mark Thoma</a>):<br />
<blockquote>But in 1991, the Persian Gulf war demonstrated the awesome utility of American land power, and the Humvee (and its civilian version, the Hummer) became a star. Likewise, the ubiquitous homemade bombs of the current Iraq insurgency have led to the development of innovative armor-protected wheeled vehicles for American forces, as well as improvements in our fleets of Humvees, tanks, armored fighting vehicles, trucks and cargo carriers. </p>
<p>In a little more than a year, the Army has procured and fielded in Iraq more than a thousand so-called mine-resistant ambush-protected vehicles. The lives of hundreds of soldiers and marines have been saved, and their tasks made more achievable, by the efforts of the American automotive industry. And unlike in World War II, America didn’t have to divert much civilian capacity to meet these military needs. Without a vigorous automotive sector, those needs could not have been quickly met.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/630/big-three-quit-your-panhandling">Andrew Samwick&#8217;s &#8220;team-crafted in Indiana&#8221; Subaru</a>** really isn&#8217;t fungible with a Dodge Magnum or even a <a href="http://www.channel4.com/4car/di/road+test/driving+impression/1102/1">GM Daewoo Nubria</a>. </p>
<p>*I&#8217;m inclined to argue that they do innovate, but much of the evidence to which one might point is not in the U.S. market.  So let&#8217;s leave <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/gm-chrysler-in-canada-news-on-cbc.html">Stormy&#8217;s post</a>—specifically, &#8220;[Canadian Minister of Industry] Tony Clement is well aware that the auto industry must transform itself&#8221;—as the AB position-of-record, subject to new information.)</p>
<p>**At least Samwick and I agree on choice of car.</p>

<p>Even the conservative Harper government of Canada is having difficulty abandoning ideology for good old fashion pragmatism, something the Republicans in the U.S. have yet to learn. GM and Chrysler&#8217;s possible implosion affects both countries in terms large numbers of jobs.</p>
<p>Tony Clement,Harper&#8217;s minister of Industry, is still in &#8220;studying the problem mode,&#8221; collecting information. Nonetheless, he is concerned&#8211;as is the CBC news media.</p>
<p>Canadian car sales are down. A lot of jobs are at stake. The Big Three were not prepared for the 21st century. In Canada, Chrysler is building muscle cars&#8211;not exactly what is needed.</p>
<p>Like U.S. Republicans, Canadian conservatives are wed to free market ideology. But a melt down of the auto industry challenges such ideology. Pragmatism may rule in Canada.  Such pragmatism may distinguish Canadian versus American conservatism.  Canadian conservatives will think outside the box, when they are forced to.</p>
<p>Right now, Republicans are toeing the ideological line. They are, however, running a huge political risk if GM and or Chrysler go under before Obama takes office.</p>
<p>Tony Clement is well aware that the auto industry must transform itself.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it needs time to do so, but it certainly is in no position to re-tool quickly, to about-face and to march to a more intelligent drummer. It needs to get over the present hurdle.</p>
<p>Obama has talked of an auto czar; Conservatives in Canada would most probably follow suit. They are watching carefully to see how the Americans jump.</p>

<p>DANCING AROUND ON ONE NAIL</p>
<p>Here is why we never get anywhere:</p>
<p>Try to ignore the “substance” (such as it is) and follow the logic.  It is from a recent thread;  names have been omitted in an imperfect attempt to concentrate on the logic and not personalities.</p>
<p>BEGIN THREAD<br />A: You say, &#8220;Nationalize Them.&#8221;</p>
<p>   That is a very slippery slope. Eventually everthing will be nationalized. There is a name for that.</p>
<p>   This is exactly what the Democrat Party wants to do, but that&#8217;s not what Americans want.</p>
<p>B: contrary to what the voices are telling you, democrats do not want to nationalize everything. or even anything.</p>
<p>A: Oh really!</p>
<p>    1.) U.S. Representative Maxine Waters during house hearings on the oil companies stated that she wants the government to &#8220;socialize&#8221; (what she meant was nationalize like Hugo           Chavez did in Venezuela) the oil companies. She goes on, after the gaffe, to state she wants the government to take over all the U.S. oil companies.</p>
<p>B: does Maxine Waters speak for the Democrats?</p>
<p>C: She certainly speaks in the U.S. Congress and most certainly for Democrats in her district and elsewhere as evidenced by her many public statements. </p>
<p>B: an example of a members statement does not qualify as a party platform.<br />     try to think of it as a problem in logic.</p>
<p>C: You say things and then act as though you didn&#8217;t say them.<br />    You made the bogus claim. Jimi answered the mail with a couple of Congressional facts &#8211; specifically, Democratic Members statements. And you continue to post junk. <br />    Jimi nailed you fair and square. And you&#8217;re still dancing around. </p>
<p>   As I said upthread: </p>
<p>     coberly &#8211; jimi contrary to what the voices are telling you, democrats do not want to nationalize everything. or even anything.</p>
<p>     coberly &#8211; Jimi does Maxine Waters speak for the Democrats?</p>
<p>     She certainly speaks in the U.S. Congress and most certainly for Democrats in her district and elsewhere as evidenced by her many public statements. </p>
<p>     No point in trying to undo what you said when Jimi has already provided an example at the Congressional level of two Members&#8217; statements. </p>
<p>END THREAD</p>
<p>I quote C at length to make it clear that he is insisting upon ridiculing something he apparently cannot understand. Anyone who cares about logic, or language, can go back to the original statement by A, and see that it was a categorical statement about “the Democrat Party.”</p>
<p>B responded, using “democrat” as short for said Democrat Party&#8230; pretty clear from the context.</p>
<p>A responds with an example of “a Democrat” as being representative of “the Democrat Party”</p>
<p>B reponds trying to distinguish between “a democrat” and “the Democrat Party”</p>
<p>but C will have none of this.  He chimes in with an accusation that B is trying to back away from what he said, because clearly there is NO difference between “a democrat” and “the Democrat Party.”  And any effort to maintain the distinction is “dancing around,” “junk,” “trying to undo what you said”.</p>
<p>Apparently in C’s mind there IS no distinction between A member of a class and ALL members of the class, or MOST members, or even MANY members.</p>
<p>This is of course the fallacy that in other circumstances we would call “prejudice” or “racism”.  But what it actually appears to be is a simple limitation of some brains that are unable to make an important distinction, and when asked to try to make that distinction they get defensive and hostile.</p>
<p>I wonder if C would accept the logic:</p>
<p>Rep Foley is a Republican<br />Rep Foley is a pederast<br />Therefore The Republican Party wants a nation of pederasts.<br />_______________________________<br />by reader coberly</p>

<blockquote><p>Though he&#8217;d been on a mission all day and was about to drop, Mike Yon just <br />called from Iraq to let me know that the war is over, and we&#8217;ve won. Whatever it <br />is that is left of violence, there isn&#8217;t combat. Roughly half of the men in the <br />unit of the 10th Mountain Division he was out on missions with are veterans with <br />previous tours of Iraq and Afghanistan, and in eight months into their <br />deployment in southern Baghdad, they haven&#8217;t fired a single bullet in combat.</p>
<p>Our soldiers in Iraq have played many roles and worn many hats, but it seems <br />that their primary role now is that of a peacekeeper, providing support to a <br />government and a people that seem increasingly capable of handling their own <br />affairs.</p>
<p>We can declare victory because President Bush wouldn&#8217;t quit on his troops. If <br />Barack Obama had his way, a triumphant Abu Musab al-Zarqawi would have had a <br />chance to have made the same claim over the Caliphate of Iraq. </p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>by Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>In my teens when I learned of the existence of credit rating agencies I wondered why private firms with such power weren&#8217;t corrupt.  Why don&#8217;t firms pay bribes to obtain high credit ratings ?  I still don&#8217;t know the answer but I think that the key is that the ratings are determined according to rules and those responsible for a particular rating have limited discretion.  Clearly top management is not easily corrupted &#8212; the value of the reputation of the credit rating agency is so huge that no client can afford a large enough bribe.  </p>
<p>However, while a single firm can&#8217;t compete with the value of the reputation of a credit rating industry a whole set of new financial instruments &#8212; say CDO&#8217;s can.  Financial innovation is good for the credit rating agencies as they have more things to rate for a fee.  Generous credit ratings for new instruments encourage financial innovation.  This creates a conflict of interest between the credit rating agencies and investors who use the ratings to decide how to invest.</p>
<p>A sort of model with no equations after the jump.</p>
<p>If there were only one credit rating agency (call it Serene&#8217;s) that agency might just decide that the knew business was worth the possible damage to reputation if it turned out that the new assets became toxic sludge with significant probability.  However, I would imagine that competition might keep credit rating agencies honest.  That is I would if I didn&#8217;t think about it much.  So consider another agency (call it Unusual and Rich).  If Unusual and Rich is being generous with credit ratings in order to encourage financial innovation, can Serene&#8217;s profit by being tough ?</p>
<p>Let me define tough.  One of the traditional requirements for a AAA rating is a long history of promptly meeting scheduled payments.  for example definitely making payments on time through the most recent recession and for another making them on time on assets identical to the newly issued one for decades.  Clearly innovative instruments can&#8217;t possible pass this test &#8212; the test of time &#8212; for decades.  Clearly credit rating agencies decided not to consider a decades long clear credit record necessary for an AAA rating.   </p>
<p>Economists said this was crazy.  Ratings based on means, variance and covariances over a few years will be vulnerable to a peso problem &#8212; that is given the data there is no way of knowing that sample means are terrible estimates of population means which are dominated by a huge possible event which hasn&#8217;t happened yet (the classic example is devaluation of the Mexican Peso).  That&#8217;s what just happened.  </p>
<p>Clearly a credit rating agency could have said &#8220;We won&#8217;t rate anything related to housing AAA, because some experts say we are in a housing bubble which will burst.  There is no way to know how these assets will perform if indeed a housing bubble bursts.  We will consider the possibility of a housing bubble bursting ruled out if no such even occurs in the next 10 years.  Maybe you will get AAA in ten years but, for now, the most you can get is A.&#8221;  Would said agency have profited by saying that ?</p>
<p>First assume that the market for the services of credit ratings agencies is very odd as there are a few players each of which has a market share of 100% (I think this is realistic but I don&#8217;t know).  That is issuers of credit pay for ratings from all the major agencies &#8212; the fees being tiny compared to the added reputational value of a second opinion.   This would tend to reduce the ruthlessness of competition.  </p>
<p>Now I wonder why, given the value of a credit rating, the agencies don&#8217;t charge huge fees.  I think the explanation is simple &#8212; credit issuers can&#8217;t afford to refrain from seeking a rating from an agency when the only explanation of their choice is that the rating would be low.  However, if an agency charges fees totally out of proportion with its costs, it gives credit issuers an excuse to not obtain a rating from it.  The key is not that the cost of the rating has increased but that the reputational cost of not getting the rating is much smaller when one can claim that the fee is outrageous and one isn&#8217;t paying it as a matter of principle.</p>
<p>This limit on fees makes it possible for fees to be so low that credit issuers obtain ratings from all reputable agencies.  It can also mean that an excellent reputation is not worth more than an average reputation.  This is certainly possible in a repeated game between agencies, credit issuers and investors (pretty much anything is).  In common sense terms it depends on what sort of fees seem unreasonable.  I&#8217;d say people look at profit margins and for some level decide that they are excessive.  A credit rating agency profit margin which seems excessive to investors&#8217; profit margin seems unreasonable to investors makes it unnecessary for credit issuers to obtain ratings from the agency to show that they aren&#8217;t afraid of the rating they would get.  </p>
<p>Assume profit margins are limited by this mechanism to a level which credit ratings agencies can easily obtain if they are equally reputable.  Being better than the other agency may be worth roughly zero.  This limits Serene&#8217;s&#8217; possible gains from being tough.</p>
<p>The first effect of toughness is a cost, credit issuers won&#8217;t ask for ratings (it is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to open one&#8217;s mouth and remove all doubt).  In the long run, if there is a bubble and it bursts, Serene&#8217;s can gain in reputation compared to Unusual and Rich *if* Unusual and Rich just sits there giving AAA ratings to junk.  However, Unusual and Rich won&#8217;t do that.  They will get tough too, because while it is no problem for both firms to damage their reputation it is very bad for Unusual and Rich to severely damage its reputation while Serene does not.</p>
<p>This means that implicit collusion can be maintained.  That is, there is an equilibrium in which both agencies give generous ratings to new instruments and both damage their reputations when the crash comes.   This is an unusual result. For a plain old cartel it is more difficult to maintain a collusive equilibrium &#8212; a firm can profit in the short run by deviating.  In this case, deviating to toughness is costly in the short run and well deviating is always costly in the long run because of the other agencies response.</p>
<p>So in this equilibrium, they rate sludge AAA.  Then the crash comes and &#8212; so what.  They all have roughly equal amounts of egg on their faces.  We can&#8217;t do without credit rating agencies.  They will still get as much business rating non-innovative assets as they would have if they were both tough.  The new class of assets might vanish, but that was inevitable given the fact that the new assets are very risky and offer modest returns.  The agencies profit from the period in which the toxic assets were issued and rated.  So long as they gave similar ratings, the damage to both of their reputations won&#8217;t hurt them at all.</p>
<p>Of course it will hurt investors who will have to do more research on their own, since they can&#8217;t trust the credit ratings agencies as much as they would have been able to trust them in the world without financial innovation.</p>

<p>(Bow to Movie Guy)</p>
<p>Apparently, GM may have to file Chapter 7 bankruptcy, meaning that it will be forced into liquidation, not reorganization. GM is asking for a government for loan of $25 billion to see them through &#8220;its worst sales slump in more than 25 years.&#8221; According to <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aBlCucXR33Jw&#038;refer=home">Bloomberg</a>, if GM fails, Ford and Chrysler will quickly be next. Again, according to Bloomberg, total loans are in the neighborhood of $50 billion.</p>
<p>To understand the gravity of the problem, we should ask a number of questions.</p>
<p>What are the consequences of GM&#8211;or the Big Three&#8211; being forced into liquidation?</p>
<p>The collapse of the big three would eliminate three million jobs. For the sake of argument, let&#8217;s say the loss of just GM means the loss of one million jobs. The repercussion to the economy are incalculable. Are we willing to lose that many jobs suddenly, within the space of one or two years?</p>
<p>Can GM and the Big Three be helped? If they have enough time, yes. Even if they have to shrink and retool, they can do so gradually.</p>
<p>Who is opposed to helping them and why? As far as I can tell, opponents fall into categories:
<ol>
<li>Those who are simply angry. These include those who have had enough of bailouts, those who are angry with the auto industry for its SUV&#8217;s&#8230;. </li>
<li>Republicans who argue that the financial package was not intended for the likes of GM </li>
<li>Those who argue that bailouts breed more bailouts, rewarding poor management and worse.</li>
</ol>
<p>Who is in favor of helping them and why?</p>
<p>Obama and many Democrats argue that the collapse of GM would wreck almost irreparable harm to the economy. The problem, they say, is time. The longer we wait&#8211;even if until January&#8211;, the more intractable and more costly the problem will become.</p>
<p>Obama aides are reported to have said that one condition of any loans will be the appointment of an auto czar to oversee the companies. Such a move now requires the approval of President Bush. (Bush recently offered to support the plan if Democrats would support a free trade agreement with Columbia. That kind of horse trading boggles the mind.)</p>
<p>I leave you with one <a href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hTlR_ry_mjT2nXKPWyYI4asuW1jQD94F08800">quotation</a> and one comment:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>GM has said Chapter 11 bankruptcy — under which the automaker would continue to operate while holding its creditors at bay and overhauling its finances — is not an option because that would scare away customers. </p>
<p>Some industry analysts say doubts about the company&#8217;s chances of survival already are driving away would-be buyers, who worry that their warranties might not be honored or that they might not be able to get replacement parts. </p>
<p>Chapter 11 bankruptcy may be of little use anyway, Baird said, since GM may not be able to get the necessary financing to reorganize itself. That could lead to Chapter 7 liquidation, in which the automaker&#8217;s assets would be sold off piecemeal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Much anger and passion surrounds these kinds of discussions. What is necessary is that we clearly frame the problem, its gravity, and then take a position.</p>
