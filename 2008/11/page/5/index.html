                                <p>Late Working-Age Suicides Rising:  Study</p>
<p>Noni Mausa</p>
<p>This study from the American Journal Of Preventive Medicine offers troubling statistics – between 1999 and 2005, there has been roughly a 5% increase in suicide rates.  But all that increase is confined to one demographic &#8212; whites aged 40 to 64.</p>
<p>An <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-suicide21-2008oct21,0,838216.story">L. A. Times story</a> today reports:<br />
<blockquote>A new six-year analysis in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine found that the U.S. suicide rate rose to 11 per 100,000 people in 2005, from 10.5 per 100,000 in 1999, an increase of just under 5%.</p>
<p>The report found that virtually all of the increase was attributable to a nearly 16% jump in suicides among people ages 40 to 64, a group not commonly seen as high-risk. The rate for that age group rose to 15.6 per 100,000 in 2005, from 13.5 per 100,000 in 1999.</p>
<p>Susan P. Baker, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health and an author of the study, said she was baffled by the findings. Sociological studies have found that middle age is generally a time of relative security and emotional well-being, she said.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><a href="http://www.ajpm-online.net/article/S0749-3797(08)00733-2/abstract">Mid-Life Suicide</a>: An Increasing Problem in U.S. Whites, 1999–2005</p>
<p>Guoqing Hu, PhDab, Holly C. Wilcox, PhDd, Lawrence Wissow, MD, MPHc, Susan P. Baker, MPHbCorresponding Author Informationemail address</p>
<p>Background</p>
<p>The overall suicide rate in the U.S. increased by 6% between 1981 and 1986 and declined by 18% between 1986 and 1999. Detailed descriptions of recent trends in suicide are lacking, especially with regard to the method of suicide. Information is needed on the major changes in rates of suicide in specific population groups in recent years (1999–2005).</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>Mortality data came from the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System. Suicide trends during 1981–2005 were analyzed by age, race, gender, and method, with an emphasis on increases between 1999 and 2005. Linear regression was used to examine the significance of trends in suicide mortality. The annual percentage change in rates was employed to measure the linear trend in suicide mortality.</p>
<p>Results</p>
<p>The suicide rate increased after 1999, due primarily to an increase in suicide among whites aged 40–64 years, whose rate of completed suicide between 1999 and 2005 rose by 2.7% annually for men and by 3.9% annually for women, with increases of 6.3% and 2.3% for hanging/suffocation, 2.8% and 19.3% for poisoning, and 1.5% and 1.9% for firearms for men and women, respectively. Rates did not increase for other age or racial groups.</p>
<p>Conclusions</p>
<p>The differential increases by age, race, gender, and method underscore a change in the epidemiology of suicide. Whites aged 40–64 years have recently emerged as a new high-risk group for suicide. Although firearms remain the most common method of suicide, the notable increases in suicide by hanging/suffocation in men and by poisoning in women deserve preventive attention.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what to make of this, though it would be easy to say that the members of the previously secure age group have since 1999 been hitting the wall like warblers in migration time.  The numbers in this study only take us up to 2005 &#8212; I wonder what;s been happening since then?</p>

<p>Matthey Yglesias <a href="http://yglesias.thinkprogress.org/archives/2008/11/interesting_reading.php#comment-859726">points</a> to <a href="http://mediamatters.org/progmaj/report">an old mediamatters.com report</a> which attempts to demolish the center right nation claim.  I think the report is a precious resource as it collects the relevant data.  Previously I found myself wasting a lot of time searching pollingreport.com.</p>
<p>I have some thoughts on the report after the jump.</p>
<p>update: also my effort to find the relevant definition of the center.</p>
<p>    Ah, I thought, a challenge—can I interpret “center right nation” so that it makes sense to warn Democrats that the USA is a center right nation ? I must find a definition of a center which isn’t well to the left of any point to which the Democrats might overstretch.<br />    OK how about the point X where the fraction of Republican representatives to the left of X is equal to the fraction of Democratic representatives to the right of X ? Not ideal. By that definition the center moved right in 2006 and 2008 as moderate Democrats beat moderate Republicans in swing districts, but it will do well enough to make the claim “America is a center right nation” even wrong.</p>
<p>    The claim then becomes that more US citizens self identify as Democrats than as Republicans, their views on policy are to the right of X. I am quite sure that this is not true—on tax progressivity, the minimum wage, universal health insurance, environmental protection, the war in Iraq, should government do more, and does the government have a responsibility to take care of people most citizens are to the left of X. On the death penalty (if you assume that Democrats who claim to support it are lying) and AFDC (if you remember what it was and who was President when it became TANF), due process rights and overwhelmingly creationism vs natural selection most US citizens are to the right of X. In other words, if the Democrats abandone decades old policy positions, they might end up too far left for the median voter.</p>
<p>    By my definition the USA was a center left country from at the latest 1996 through the present except maybe for a year or two after 9/11. However, I thought, with great effort and in a spirit of bipartisanship, I can interpret Republicans claims so they are meaningful albeit false.</p>
<p>    Then I read this<br />    http://thinkprogress.org/2008/11/20/boehner-center-right/</p>
<p>    BOEHNER: … I think the Congress is still a center-right Congress.</p>
<p>    OK back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>Now my report on the report</p>
<p>The report is excellent and shows that the authors put a huge amount of work in it.  In contrast this comment is off the top of my head.  I will try to get the relatively interesting stuff up here at the top.  </p>
<p>When asserting the bogosity of the center right nation claim, I have repeatedly found myself wasting time scrolling past irrelevant data at pollingreport.com looking for the relevant poll which shows that adult Americans have progressive views on the key issue under dispute.  The report, which I just hotlisted, is a precious resource getting the relevant data in one place and not mixing it with ten times as many polls on whether you approve of how George Bush is handling an issue.</p>
<p>However the mass of data presented is considerable less than the mass of relevant data.  In particular, media matters has cherry picked.  On abortion, for example, there is a huge amount of polling data.  Polls on &#8220;If a woman should be allowed to have an abortion if chooses to have one for the following reason (list of reasons) show only a minority saying yes for all reasons.  This shows that there are people who must have contradictory views &#8212; who support Roe vs Wade in the abstract but disagree with it when the questions get specific http://www.pollingreport.com/abortion.htm.  </p>
<p>I think what is needed is for conservatives with integrity (not as rare as flying pigs) to attempt a counter-report following the outline of the media matters report, but picking different polls with slightly different wording for each issue heading.  Then, comparing the reports, interested readers could decide who had made a more convincing case.  I don&#8217;t doubt that I personally would conclude that media matters is right and if the center is half way between Dems and Reps the US is a center left to left nation.  But, you know, debate is really useful.  Pity there are so few reality based conservatives with whom mediamatters et al can debate.</p>
<p>[there should be another &#8220;There&#8217;s more&#8221; jump here but I don&#8217;t know how to nest them.</p>
<p>As a regular reader of pollingreport.com and also of liberal blogs, I can&#8217;t say I was generally surprised by the data reported by mediamatters.  I was surprised by the results on crime and punishment.  </p>
<p>Nor am I generally surprised by pundits making claims about what Americans think which are inconsistent with polling data, although I thought everyone knew that a majority supports gun control (which majority loses to the minority which includes many people who care passionately and are organized by the NRA as well as reality based critics claims for the effectiveness of gun control such as you and &#8230; birds chirp &#8230; well you must know some others).</p>
<p>I did object to the text above the data on protectionism.  I was going to comment dilating on the theme &#8220;What&#8217;s progressive about nationalist xenophobic hostility to the interests of workers in poor countries&#8221; until I got to the paragraph after the data which noted that opposition to free trade is not necessarily based on progressive motives.  I am still pissed that one of those ideology self tests said I was socially liberal but not egalitarian, because my views on trade are based on concern for the interests of the poorest people in the world who sure aren&#8217;t US workers.</p>

<p>PGL sums it up as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Truth be told – this is a major reason why conservatives want to undermine the Social Security program. Yes – they do try to tell us it’s some sort of Ponzi scheme, which of course, is just blatant dishonesty. But the real reason that they hate Social Security is that it is popular – as well as good policy from the perspective of those who care at least as much about the working class as the investor class.</p></blockquote>
<p> Another way of saying this is that the debate over Social Security is not and never really has been about the best way to insure retirement security for workers, opponents simply don&#8217;t care that their numbers don&#8217;t add up, when indeed they use numbers at all. Instead they approach the subject from two conjoined perspectives: one that Social Security (and Universal Health Care coverage) is Socialism and/or two that Social Security (and Universal Health Care) if perceived to be successful are political winners for the Democrats for possibly decades to come.</p>
<p>In practice it is hard to separate out the Hayekians who believe that all of this is just the first steps on the <a href="http://www.mises.org/books/TRTS/">Road to Serfdom</a> from the Rovians who believe that successful social programs are instead the Road to Political Oblivian for the Republican Party from the Sheep who simply know what they have been told. And of course these groups all to a degree cross-cut, it is difficult to reliably differentiate knave from fool. But no one who cares about Social Security or Universal Health Care coverage should assume that the opposition they encounter are solely motivated by data about program effectiveness and relative costs, that you are going to get through to these people by explaining how small the problem is in the case of Social Security or how honest cross-country cost/outcome numbers show that other developing countries get more bang for their health care buck, that is to make the simple mistake that political discourse on these topics is fundamentally Reality Based instead of being what it really is: driven by ideology on one hand and political outcomes on the other.</p>
<p>For many, many people the claim &#8220;There is no Crisis&#8221; is not the answer to a specific problem, instead it IS the problem. Without &#8216;Crisis&#8217; they got nothing. And the smarter, better informed ones know it (hence the whiff of panic floating around the halls of Cato).</p>

<p>I guess we can pretend he&#8217;s not a Clinton administration alum.  And he has the right experience:<br />
<blockquote>Though not an economist, Mr. Geithner has a deep understanding of monetary and fiscal policy and broad experience in international trade issues. Before the current crisis, he was involved in the bailouts of Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, Brazil and Thailand.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also continues the tradition of being younger than most of the posters at Angry Bear.</p>

<p>Members of the G-7 are the United States, France, Canada, Italy, Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>For Japan, trade is its life&#8217;s blood. According to the <a href="http://economie.moldova.org/stiri/eng/166532/">Finance Ministry</a>,<br />
<blockquote>It was the first October in 28 years when the country, whose economy is the second largest in the world after the United States, saw its trade balance fall into the red&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Germany is still hanging on to its trade surplus. France also posted a trade surplus; I think wine is good these days.</p>
<p><a href="http://italyeconomicinfo.blogspot.com/2008/06/italy-external-trade-april-2008.html">Italy</a> is running deficit, not sure exactly how much. Canada, as well, enjoys a trade surplus.</p>
<p>Normally, net trade (exports + imports) for most countries trade is not out of balance; that is to say, a country will have a modest surplus or deficit. For the U.S. the ratio of imports to exports is close to 2:1, which is really quite astounding. No major country in the world has such a high ratio of imports to exports.</p>
<p>Globally, net trade has to be zero (total exports + total imports must be equal), even if total trade shrinks. Every country wants a trade surplus, clearly an impossibility.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.france24.com/20081111-china-benefits-record-trade-surplus-inflation-exports&#038;navi=ASIE-PACIFIQUE">China said</a><br />
<blockquote>Tuesday its trade surplus hit a monthly all-time high of 35.2 billion dollars in October, on the back of rising exports despite the global economic turmoil.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nonetheless, if total trade shrinks, then economic activity will shrink as well. We are in for a long and difficult period, especially those in the U.S. </p>
<p>Deflation is here. As it ripples through economies, every attempt will be made to keep it at bay. As asset prices plunge, so too must salaries and income. Think of each salaried worker screaming as he tries to keep his share of the pie. Ultimately, he will have to accept less for a paycheck. If the cost of the product he makes falls, so too must his salary. Whole lot of dominoes falling.</p>
<p>Debt, debt is the killer, for the debt he carries is now portionally larger relative to his income.</p>
<p>For this reason alone, the U.S. is in more difficulty than most.</p>

<p>hat tip to reader Jack for this example of reading making the rounds of car dealers:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Subject: An example of American management expertise.</p>
<p>    It&#8217;s nice when they use an analogy to show what&#8217;s really going on &#8211; then we can understand it better. This should be sent to GM !!!<br />    Toyota and GM decided to have a canoe race on the Missouri River. </p>
<p>    Both teams practiced long and hard to reach their peak performance before the race. </p>
<p>    BUT on the big day, the Japanese won by a mile. </p>
<p>    The Americans, tired and depressed, decided to investigate the reason for the crushing defeat. A management team made up of senior management was formed to investigate and recommend appropriate action. </p>
<p>    Their conclusion was the Japanese had 8 people rowing and 1 person steering, while the American team had 8 people steering and 1 person rowing. So American management hired a consulting company referred to them by the US Government and paid them a large amount of money for a second opinion.</p>
<p>    The consultants advised that too many people were steering the boat, while not enough people were rowing. To prevent another loss to the Japanese, the rowing team&#8217;s management structure was totally reorganized into 3 steering supervisors, 1 area steering superintendents, 1 publicity manager, 1 HR diversity coordinator, 1 union rep, and a rower.</p>
<p>    They also implemented a new performance system that would give the 1 person rowing the boat greater incentive to work harder. It was called the &#8220;Rowing Team Quality First Program&#8221;, with a lunch and a free company pen for the rower. There was discussion of getting new paddles, canoes, and other equipment, extra vacation days for practices and performance-tied bonuses but that decision was held up in committee.</p>
<p>    BUT the next year the Japanese won by two miles. </p>
<p>    Humiliated, the American management laid off the rower for poor performance, halted development of a new canoe, sold the paddles, and canceled all capital investments for new equipment. </p>
<p>    The money from all sales and all fore casted moneys saved from further competition was distributed to the Senior Executives as bonuses and the next year&#8217;s racing team was out-sourced to India.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;With thousands of houses already torched beyond repair and tens of<br />thousands more likely to perish, this mass immolation will reduce the<br />surplus supply of houses in California.&#8221; said Professor Saul O&#8217;Hara of<br />the New York School of Economics today. &#8220;With a drop in supply there<br />will come an increase in prices, which will then reinvigorate the<br />state&#8217;s, and the nation&#8217;s, property market&#8221;.</p>
<p>Steps have already been taken to ensure the destruction of as many<br />houses as possible. Earlier today, Governor Schwarzenegger called in the<br />California Air National Guard to begin fire bombing the Inland Empire.</p>
<p>(Don&#8217;t forget the taxes.  With prop 13, you can&#8217;t raise property taxes on existing homes unless they&#8217;re sold.  Burning down houses, on the other hand, means when new ones are built tax revenues will rise&#8230;cactus)</p>

<p>In a discussion on November 16th under the title The Gold Standard in One Easy Quote, I suggested inverting a chart of the spot price of gold in dollars to get a chart of the way a gold based currency would behave. Rdan thoughtfully inverted said chart (labels and all) and asked me to write up whatever the heck it was I was thinking of.</p>
<p>What I was thinking is that if Gold is indeed a true measure of value then a chart of the spot price of X amount of Gold is a chart of the true price of a market basket of goods and services over time. In fact, the extent that such a chart differs from a straight horizontal line ought to be a pretty good chart of inflation in the fiat currency over time. Might be a good way to check if CPI actually describes inflation. So here&#8217;s the chart.</p>

<p>Oopsie. Kind of bumpy, no? Belay that inflation checking thing. Data seems way too noisy for that.</p>
<p>Why invert the chart? </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SSAOk2xZxOI/AAAAAAAAAZw/AnxkoxfD2Zc/s1600-h/au75-pres+flipped.GIF"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SSAOk2xZxOI/AAAAAAAAAZw/AnxkoxfD2Zc/s320/au75-pres+flipped.GIF" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well, we&#8217;re kind of used to looking at charts where economic downturns point down, not up. And those peaks in the price of Gold correspond to times where those who have cash will thrive and those who have borrowed will be in trouble &#8212; especially if they are leveraged. They must repay Gold they borrowed in easier times with Gold that has become dear. Times like &#8230; well &#8230; today. So here is the inverted chart.</p>
<p>There are two kind of scary things about the charts whether right side up or inverted. One is the amount of volatility. The value of either Gold or dollars is apparently often bouncing by 10-20% or more in a few weeks. Quite large changes are seen in a few months or a year. It probably isn&#8217;t dollars that are bouncing. If it were, we&#8217;d see that in in other metrics like inflation. It would, I think, be difficult to transact modern business with a currency whose purchasing power was that variable. The second is the relatively small amount of time that the inverted chart spends in sustained upward trends that would seem to be growth intervals of expanding money supply 1979-81, 1982-1984, 1987-1992, 1996-2000.</p>
<p>This little essay is hardly the final word on the efficacy of a Gold Standard. But I think these charts ought to give even the most fervent gold bug pause. If the charts really tell us about purchasing power and economic growth in a Gold Standard world, my feeling is &#8212; Thanks no, I&#8217;d go with a fiat currency or maybe Milton Friedman&#8217;s constant money supply growth. Don&#8217;t need no steenking Gold. <br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />by vtcodger</p>

<p>This paper focuses on two main issues. First, we find that, on average, households’ discount rates decline. This implies dynamically inconsistent preferences. Second, we calculate an indicator of the degree of dynamic inconsistency that may help us to understand how households overcome their self-control problems. We use a micro data set containing households’ reports on the compensation for receiving hypothetical rewards with delays. We find that individuals with more severely dynamically inconsistent preferences on average hold a statistically significantly lower share of their total wealth in checking accounts. A possible interpretation is that subjects use pre-commitment strategies to limit their temptation to consume immediately.</p>

<p>old longer abstract after the jump</p>
<p>OK so there is this wonderful underused dataset from <a href="http://center.uvt.nl/">CentER</a> via <a href="http://dspace.uniroma2.it/dspace/bitstream/2108/197/1/203+Giamboni.pdf">Luigi Giamboni</a> (warning pdf).</p>
<p>It includes a question on what return people would demand in order to wait 3 months for cash and in order to wait 12 months (no cash really changed hands so it is just a survey not an experiment). One can calculate an annual required interest rate from the answer two the wait three months question. Very often this was much higher than the required annual rate. This means that respondents had dynamically inconsistent preferences. That means (in English) that, given their stated preferences, they would like defend the interests of their 12 months later selves by preventing their 9 months later selves from spending as much as said 9 months later selves would like to spend. If one has dynamically inconsistent preferences one would like to tie one&#8217;s future hands.</p>
<p>A sophisticated agent who knows that he or she has dynamically inconsistent preference will find ways to restrict his or her future choices. For example, people with weight problems go to fat farms, People pay for residential drug treatment, drug addled (but not completely addled) celebrities hire dissenablers to prevent them from using drugs etc etc.</p>
<p>If one is worried about future consumption one&#8217;s desire for liquidity may actually be negative for some levels of liquidity. I might want to tie my money up in a non liquid asset, say a house, because otherwise I won&#8217;t be able to keep myself from spending it. Cash and the balances of checking accounts are very liquid and people with spending problems may rationally choose to hold an unusually small fraction of their wealth as checking account balances.</p>
<p>Why lo and behold the computer says this is true. The coefficient of a household money demand equation on the dynamic inconsistency index is negative and statistically insignificant.</p>
<p>Who ever would have thunk ? Well I would have for 24 years by now, but I never found the data to test the hypothesis.</p>
