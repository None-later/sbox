<blockquote><p>A leading drug company may be poised to win a landmark legal victory next fall. If the drug manufacturer, Wyeth, prevails in a case soon to be argued before the U.S. Supreme Court (Wyeth v. Levine),1 drug companies could effectively be immunized against state-level tort litigation if their products that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are later found to be defective. <br />A medical-device company won such a victory in April. In Riegel v. Medtronic,2 the Supreme Court determined that a product-liability lawsuit against Medtronic in a state court was preempted because the device had received FDA approval. Preemption is a legal doctrine based on the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which states that when federal and state laws are at odds, federal law takes precedence. Its application to state tort litigation is a radical extension of its original meaning. </p>
<p>Medtronic won its case because the 1976 law that grants the FDA authority to regulate medical devices contains a clause asserting that state requirements with regard to medical devices are preempted by federal requirements. Although the preemption clause is silent on common-law tort actions, the Supreme Court (with Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the Court) interpreted the preemption clause broadly to include such actions. </p>
<p>Unlike the law governing medical devices, the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which provides the statutory framework for the regulation of drugs by the FDA, contains no such preemption clause. Thus, in Wyeth v. Levine — which concerns a patient who lost her arm after an injection of Wyeth&#8217;s antiemetic drug Phenergan — the Court will decide whether preemption of state tort litigation is implied by the law, even though it is not explicitly stated. </p>
<p>Previous administrations and the FDA considered tort litigation to be an important part of an overall regulatory framework for drugs and devices; product-liability litigation by consumers was believed to complement the FDA&#8217;s regulatory actions and enhance patient safety. Margaret Jane Porter, former chief counsel of the FDA, wrote, &#8220;FDA product approval and state tort liability usually operate independently, each providing a significant, yet distinct, layer of consumer protection.&#8221;3 Persons who are harmed have the right to seek legal redress. Preemption would erase that right.</p></blockquote>
<p>Real conservatives note that the courts are an avenue for personal redress for injury.  what is it called when a company has immunity provided by a government agency-something ism, I believe.  </p>
<p>Current Republicans also complain of tort law and insurance, but have not made any case at all using court statistics to prove the point of awards versus malpractice insurance rates.</p>
<p>Usually just insurance rates are quoted, which is real.  But I have yet to see reasonably open books by insurance companies to make the case, and a list of judgements on which they based their predictions of higher payouts/rate ratios.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be simpler if insurance companies supply the data, since I assume they have had to access such data?</p>
<p>If they did not <a href="http://www.mcandl.com/ohio.html">demand policy and regulation changes</a>, perhaps they might have an easier time of it. If you demand regulatory action and favors, is it reasonable to open the books some for a check on the claims?</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Senator McCain was in Colombia last week touting his support for the trade agreement that the Bush administration had negotiated with the country. He also touted his support for NAFTA, contrasting both positions with Senator Obama&#8217;s opposition to the two pacts. McCain had an important ally in his campaign. The media decided to embellish McCain&#8217;s case by touting his support for &#8216;free trade,&#8217; as opposed to the specific deals in question. This is a very important difference and it reflects deeply held biases in the media.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Still happening.  Free of details?  Free of thought?  Free of consequences?  That is my take.  What does free mean in regards to trade&#8230;free product?  Free market?</p>

<blockquote><p>Some readers have said that one cannot read much into the results of all these series, that they do not, in fact, show that Democrats do a better job at these measures than Republicans. These readers tend to want to vote Republican, and they insist that most of a President’s policies have long lag times, so their effects may not even show while a President is in office.</p>
<p>And to some extent, they’re right. For instance, to use a little publicized piece of policy… when GW (temporarily) retired the 30 year bond in 2001, he in effect prevented the country from locking in the very, very low rates that prevailed until the 30 year bond was reinstated. This will result in higher interest payments, probably for decades to come. Similarly, abstinence only programs – children not having the benefit of sex ed are likely to have unexpected and unwanted pregnancies with allthe problems that entails, including abortions, as much as 30 years later.</p>
<p>But most of a President’s policies have a much more immediate effect. And most people who insist on the long lag explanation believe that too – most of them are quick to credit the performance of the economy in the last few years (though, I would imagine, not in the last quarter) to the President’s tax cuts in 2003. And they are quick to credit Reagan for turning the country around – early in the Reagan administration, not during the GHW administration. (Though if one reads the National Review or Clown Hall, one can sometimes find examples where they credit Reagan for everything good that happened in the Clinton years.) </p>
<p>Furthermore, I’ve had posts looking at the correlation between deficit spending and growth, and between taxes and growth. The correlations are there, and they kick in very quickly.</p>
<p>But in the end, the big problem with the lag theory is that the <em>length of the lag magically changes</em>. If Republicans are responsible for the growth during Democratic admnistrations, and vice versa, how do we account for the poor performance of GHW in almost every measure? Did Reagan’s virtues only begin to kick in 4 years after he left office? And why didn’t that happen with Ike, or Nixon/Ford, both of whom were followed by Presidents that outperformed them on most measures? </p>
<p>Similarly, if Reagan had to struggle to build things up after Carter… why did GHW have the same struggle? And if it took Carter only four years to screw things up, why wasn’t that true of the other Democratic administrations? Why didn’t things hit the proverbial fan from 1965 to 1968, or from 1996 to 2000? </p>
<p>And then there is one other problem. To which President would the lag proponents credit the performance during the Reagan administration? Carter? Nixon &#038; Ford? Or does it go back farther, to LBJ? I think none of the above. They will tell you that Reagan was the one that made things the way they were in the Reagan administration, at least the good thing. (I’ve seen the Reagan deficits blamed on Congress many a time.) </p>
<p>I don’t buy the lag story at all. If the data shows that things generally went better in Democratic administrations, its either because God doesn’t like it when we vote Republican, or because Democratic Presidents have followed better policies. Take your pick.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>And that lumping together Shia extremists with Sunni extremists, assuming that Persian culture is the same as Arab culture, that those kinds of errors in lumping Islam together result in us not only being less effective in hunting down and isolating terrorists, but also in alienating what need to be our long-term allies on a whole host of issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ezra notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As Obama says, one of the clear distinctions between the Left&#8217;s approach to terrorism and the Right&#8217;s approach to terrorism is that the Left wants to limit the scope of the conflict, while the Right wants to expand it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bingo – but the money quote has to be:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rather than this being an effort to hunt down al Qaeda, it becomes a war to hunt down al Qaeda, destroy Hezbollah, eradicate Hamas, overthrow Saddam Hussein, change the regime in Tehran, crush the Muslim Brotherhood, and confront Syria, and whatever else Bill Kristol thought of while eating his Cheerios that week.</p></blockquote>

<p>Another major energy proposal in the McCain economic plan is ending subsidies for corn ethanol and eliminating the tariff that effectively bars to importation of sugar cane ethanol. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13view.html?ex=1373601600&#038;en=d29d44dcc70127bf&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink"> Greg Mankiw scored these on behalf of the economics profession</a> as points for McCain over Obama in the NYT over the weekend.  I agree that corn ethanol subsidies are best eliminated as soon as possible — though I note that Obama, while not going so far as McCain on subsidies, is pretty straight-talking about the limitations of corn ethanol especially considering that he represents the corn belt and not the desert.</p>
<p>On the McCain plans for promoting trade in cane ethanol — the Shorter Version of which is that he&#8217;s proposing to substitute dependence on foreign ethanol for dependence on foreign oil (*) — there are significant issues that go to the suitability of &#8220;free&#8221; markets for provision of biofuels.  Whether or not expanding trade in ethanol is a good thing depends on other institutional arrangements that are not automatic consequences of reducing tariffs and other moves to freer trade.  Since critical policy decisions are outside the reach of U.S. policymakers, economists should be concerned about making policy with the institutions we have, and not the institutions we&#8217;d like to assume we have.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a broad dawning that not all biofuels, and not all methods for producing all biofuels, equally satisfy all of the policy goals that they might purport to help satisfy.  Those include substituting domestic resources for imported resources, reducing fossil fuel use, and reducing the carbon intensity of liquid fuel use.  Land use issues are critical both for the global warming-related goals for biofuel use and for avoiding blowback from high food prices.  (Recent <a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/15382">research out of UW-Madison</a> shows that redirecting marginal agricultural lands to cane ethanol in fact can be beneficial, but conversions from forests and other uses are not.)  The problem is that lowering tariffs on cane ethanol doesn&#8217;t guarantee, and indeed in the absence of other interventions would probably work strongly against, desirable land use patterns.</p>
<p>Brazil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel_in_Brazil#Economic_and_production_indicators">produces a lot of ethanol</a> by the standards of the ethanol industry, but not a lot relative to U.S. petroleum-based fuel imports.  The former was 327,000 barrels/day in &#8217;07, whereas the latter is 13-14 million b/d (unadjusted for the energy densities of the fuels).   Growing enough cane to replace U.S. oil imports with ethanol would require on the order of half the arable land area of Brazil; major cane ethanol substitution would necessarily occur at scales where adverse land-use consequences can&#8217;t be assumed away.  Note that the current food-price spike, largely blamed on biofuel mandates, happened with only a couple percent of arable land devoted to biofuel crops.</p>
<p>Economists certainly can imagine market-based remedies for the problem, such as Pigovian taxes on certain land-use changes, to name one that Mankiw ought to support in principle.  But removing U.S. tariffs won&#8217;t make land-use regulation in countries suitable to cane growing appear by magic.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to add in liquid-fuel demand destruction on hitherto unprecedented scales for the U.S.  Along those lines, apart from his willingness to commit 15% of one year&#8217;s &#8220;clean coal&#8221; research funds to the cause of battery technology, McCain isn&#8217;t explicitly committed to more than the pending tightening of fuel economy regulations.  McCain&#8217;s long-standing hostility to rail and apparent indifference towards non-automobile transportation modes doesn&#8217;t make the job of reducing petroleum-based fuel consumption (and doing it in less painful ways to consumers than letting the price mechanism work its magic) any easier.</p>
<p>(*) Economists wouldn&#8217;t tend to be bothered by this, but it&#8217;s at odds with McCain&#8217;s energy independence rhetoric.</p>

                                <p>Here&#8217;s an oddity from the McCain economic plan — McCain found some jobs that have gone away and that does want to bring back:<br />
<blockquote>The development of clean coal technology will revitalize coal mining and return jobs to some of America&#8217;s most economically disadvantaged areas.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/ptb0702.html">U.S. coal production</a> was 1.146 billion (short) tons in 2007, just short of the record 1.163 billion tons in 2006.  There are three major features of coal production history: a long secular increase from the early sixties, a shift from underground to surface (a/k/a strip) mining as the dominant production mode, and great increases in productivity in both modes from the 1980s onward.  In 1987, an <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/ptb0706.html">hour of mining labor</a> extracted 2.2 tons of coal in an underground mine, and 4.98 tons in a surface mine.  By 2007, those figures had increased to 3.26 and 10.23 tons/hour, respectively.</p>
<p>So why is John McCain against labor productivity?</p>
<p>And why am I reminded of Dana Carvey&#8217;s <a href="http://www.danacarvey.net/media/snl_grumpy_losealimb.wav">Grumpy Old Man</a> character?  &#8220;In my day, we mined coal with our fingernails, got black lung, and that&#8217;s the way it was, and we LIKED IT!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Oil and gas companies should &#8220;use or lose&#8221; access to the 68 million publicly held acres where they can currently drill but aren&#8217;t. There&#8217;s no reason that companies should be able to lock up oil and gas reserves on publicly held land when we&#8217;ve made a choice as a nation to begin extraction in those locations.  Let&#8217;s find a company that will if that is our choice, with proper protections, and get on with it.  One year should be enough time to transfer ownership and re-direct government subsidies to companies that have get up and go.</p>
<p>Update:  Smiley face here.  I haven&#8217;t gone all radical dem.</p>
<p>Update 2:  Need access to proof there is little oil and gas in those acres.  Preferably geologic exploratory information.  The software is available to do just that, so anyone???</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to thank Dan for putting up graphs from some of my previous posts, and for reminding people that I&#8217;m working on a book.  Here&#8217;s the status:  together with a co-author who currently wants to remain nameless, I completed a first draft of the book and went looking for an agent.  We found one who has a good publishing record, and who has represented authors of a few books that are as offbeat as ours.  He promptly told us the idea was good but the execution sucked.  He was right.  He made us write and rewrite the first chapter over and over until, if I might say so myself, it actually reads pretty well.  We&#8217;ve also benefited greatly from a few other reviewers &#8211; some of them Angry Bears and readers of the site.  Now that we know how its done, we&#8217;ve been working on some of the other chapters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, our agent has been sniffing out publishers.  Recently, he chatted one up who was interested in seeing our proposal.  So we&#8217;ve written and rewritten and rewritten a proposal, and sent it to our agent.  Depending on his comments, it may be ready to go to the publisher.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;ve learned about the publishing industry is this &#8211; there&#8217;s a long leadtime between when a publisher signs a book and when it shows up on store shelves &#8211; about nine months.  Booksellers must be prepped.  </p>
<p>In our case, assuming a publisher signs us, the book would probably be available about a year from now.  This would be so that we could include complete data for the GW administration, comparing his administration to the others on an apples-to-apples basis.  </p>
<p>A few brief comments about my co-author.  As I noted, he wishes to remain nameless right now.  However, I think he wouldn&#8217;t mind if I mentioned that he writes on economic issues for a well-known newspaper.  As a result, he is very good at writing in a neutral tone, and he has done amazing work at ferreting out my biases from the writing as well.  I would also add &#8211; in terms of politics, my co-author is officially independent, though the one statement he was willing to make about his politics at the start of the project was that he did admire the first President Bush.  Of course, the data being what it is, it seems my co-author is somewhat less admiring of the first President Bush now, and regardless of our attempts to be nonpartisan, we will no doubt get called biased if and when the book gets published.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />by cactus</p>

<p>Here is a quick update from GAO on the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08991t.pdf"> US Air Force Tanker procurement debacle</a>.  </p>
<p>Not to seem biased but “what were they thinking?” </p>
<p>An oral history on &#8220;requirements&#8221;.</p>
<p>In World War II it was obvious that the ability to haul short range, fighter aircraft around the ocean expanses would be critical to beating Japan and Germany in the naval wars.  There were no refueling aircraft to shepherd the fighters across the seas.</p>
<p>The standard navy line was to build a large fleet carriers, which were very fast ships and carried a large complement of aircraft.  The model was the carriers which won at Midway, large air arms mixed to engage in fleet combat, which is against other forces equipped with similar carriers.</p>
<p>The fleet carriers were very versatile and at huge expense could also engage in anti submarine warfare, convoy escort and delivering attack aircraft to newly secured airfields. </p>
<p>In 1942 the US Navy could send only one fleet carrier to the Atlantic, to support the convoys crossing the Atlantic as well as other missions.  Royal Navy air arms were busy keeping the Mediterranean open.  The US Navy ultimately ordered 30 Essex class fleet carriers of which delivered 24 by the end of the war.</p>
<p>Henry Kaiser delivered an &#8220;unsolicited proposal” to build escort carriers which were about a third the displacement of fleet carriers.  They supported a couple dozen aircraft while the fleet boats carried 3 or 4 times that number.</p>
<p>Kaiser delivered 50 escort carriers from the Kaiser shipyard in Washington State between Nov 1942 and July 1944. </p>
<p>These were the ships which ferried fighters to the invasions in the Pacific, they escorted convoys of US soldiers going to Britain and they were responsible in large part for ending the German submarine threat in the European theater.</p>
<p>What were the admirals thinking when they only ordered fleet carriers?</p>
<p>What was the US Air Force thinking when they ordered the aerial refueling version of fleet carriers when 99% of the mission needs jeep refuelers like the KC 135?</p>
<p>I will be viewed as biased if I report that all the talk about old aircraft ignores and subverts the fact that the KC-135 airframes have flown less than half the hours they were designed for and far fewer than the Boeing 707 has shown can be economically flown.</p>
<p>The admirals, like the US Air Force today only see big toys that can do every thing but miss the small numbers and high cost to do most of the missions.</p>
<p>More on making needs into requirements next time we I whittle a beak.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />by ilsm</p>

<p>A reader at <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/07/my-daughter-wants-a-trust-fund/">Economist Mom</a> offered the following story on her daughter wants a trust fund post.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230; this post reminded me of an exchange I had with our five-year-old. I fronted him $10 for something he wanted when he forgot his wallet. When it was time to pay his allowance I told him he actually owed me money, so he got down his “monkey bank” and I started taking coins. He looked horrified, then he broke into tears&#8221;</p>
<p>This story broke my heart because I understand the way the five year old felt, and I was once as stupid as the parent.  Five year olds cannot understand &#8220;paying your bills&#8221; and &#8220;robbing my piggy bank&#8221; feels like a betrayal of trust.</p>
<p>Grownups should understand the relationship between &#8220;their money&#8221;  and  &#8220;their bills.&#8221;  But probably most of them are not much better at it than that five year old.  Most of the horrified sounds coming from the Entitlements &#8220;debate,&#8221;  are due to a complete failure of people to understand that they need to spend their own money in order to pay for their own food and medical care after they are too old to work. When you collect their payroll tax they cry.  Actually most people don&#8217;t notice until someone tells them that the tax is going to go up fifty percent! or a hundred percent!  or whatever misleading number the hystericizer thinks he can get away with today.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the most alarming number:  The Trustees say that by 2085, Social Security and Medicare will cost 30% of payroll&#8230;  this is greater than your entire tax bill today,  it is a hundred percent increase in &#8220;the&#8221; tax.  It is a crushing burden on &#8220;the young.&#8221;  And of course, &#8220;We&#8217;re all going to die.&#8221;  I forgot all the exclamation marks, so here they are:  !!!!!</p>
<p>One thing that always bothers me is that when I point out the worker will only &#8220;see&#8221; half of that 30%, someone always tells me that &#8220;economists agree&#8221; that the other half is &#8220;really&#8221; the employees money.<br />Well, of course it is,  and you know better than I do if you would ever see that money if the government didn&#8217;t force your boss to pay it to you (to you?  to you!),  but I know the bosses think of it as &#8220;their&#8221; money when there are no workers listening.</p>
<p>But here is something: If the other half is really your money,  then your income is not 100% of your paycheck before deductions.  It is 115%.  The extra 15% is the boss&#8217;s contribution to your &#8220;entitlements.&#8221;<br />But then, wait a minute,  if I am paying 30% of my paycheck before deductions, I am actually paying 30% of 115%, or 26% of my &#8220;income.&#8221;  And here I have to realize that no one will understand what I just said.</p>
<p>Suppose your before taxes pay is 1000.  you pay 150 dollars in payroll tax and your boss pays another 115 dollars.  But he says that is &#8220;really&#8221; your money.  So your &#8220;real&#8221; pay was &#8220;really&#8221; 1150 dollars. And your &#8220;real&#8221; tax was &#8220;really&#8221; 300 dollars.  300/1150  =  26%.  Your &#8220;real&#8221; tax is &#8220;really&#8221; 26%</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this helps you feel better.  I should stop and let you rest, but below the fold, I&#8217;ll pick up on the five year old and the piggybank story.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />This one written by coberly</p>
<p>There you are in 2085&#8230;  of course you are going to get there.  And everything is going to be just the same as it is today.  Except that you will be paying this huge &#8220;entitlement&#8221; tax.  If you will let me call it 15% I will agree to remember it&#8217;s really 30% and the boss&#8217;s half is &#8220;really&#8221; your money.  But it&#8217;s easier to keep track of if we just talk about the numbers printed on your paycheck.  And leave the &#8220;what if&#8221; questions to those economists.</p>
<p>What the hystericizers always leave out is that the Trustees&#8230; the very people who are saying that Social Security and Medicare will be 30% of payroll &#8230; also say that incomes will be going up 1.1% per year&#8230; this is real income&#8230;   income to employees,  leaving the rest of the 1.7% of real productivity growth to find its way to your boss.  (oh!  that&#8217;s where the boss&#8217;s share comes from.)  But lets see, 1.1% compounded for the next 77 years is 232%.  Your wages will be 2 and one third times as big as they are today.</p>
<p>And now, gentle reader, lets stop talking in percents because they are confusing to most people.</p>
<p>Average income today is about 700 dollars per week.  232% of 700 dollars is $1,624 dollars per week.  That&#8217; what an average worker will be making in real dollars in 2085.  Out of that he will be paying 244 dollars for his Social Security and Medicare, leaving him 1380 for his other bills, including other taxes.  How&#8217;s he doing compared to today?  Well today he pays about 7 and a half percent for Social Security and Medicare&#8230; 700 time 0.075 equals  53 dollars a week.  leaving him $647 dollars per week for his other bills, including other taxes.  That means that in 2085 he will have 1380 &#8211; 647  = 733 dollars per week after paying payroll taxes MORE than he has today. Or about twice as much. </p>
<p>Well, so what?  Why should he settle for 205% when he is making 232% more than he was 77 years ago?  Well, because the extra money is going into a piggy bank to pay for his food and shelter and clothing and medical care after he retires&#8230; in case he wants to, or has to, retire when he is 65 instead of working until he is ready for the feeding tube.</p>
<p>Wait.  Why are you crying?</p>
