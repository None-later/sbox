<p>This week I expand upon my response to 2Slugbaits&#8217; comments to the excellent post <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/army-navy-air-force-marines-how-can-it.html">Army navy air force Marines Budget; Peace in our Times</a><br />by Robert Waldmann<br />.<br />2Slugbaits&#8217;  comment revolves around the fact that the Army, a situation common to the other services, is in a contractor trap.  The result is despite spending huge, budget busting, sums for contractor support the weapons are not meeting the readiness nor reliability needs of the soldiers.</p>
<p>Check a couple of GAO reports: </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04715.pdf">GAO 04-715</a> was about enhancing implementaion of Performance Based Logistics.</p>
<p>The second, DoD needs to show any benefit from <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05966.pdf%20%3Cbr%20/%3E">Performance Based Logistic (PBL) contracts</a>.</p>
<p>To my knowledge GAO stopped looking after 2005, the results are too dismal.  The two reports said: </p>
<blockquote><p>PBL does not deliver required support outcomes and is always far more expensive than planned.  Does the thought they &#8220;buy in&#8221; come to mind?<br />PBL is a product management concept, including a design and system engineering approach, which requires that an integrated support &#8220;package&#8221; be designed to minimize long term support costs while delivering specified levels of reliability and weapon system capabilities.  For PBL to be delivered you had to have a &#8220;quality&#8221; design.  A design which delivered a reliable product with resources, a &#8220;package&#8221; to provide repairs in the operating world to keep the equipment running to do the job for the soldiers depending on it.<br />The problem with PBL is the &#8220;package&#8221;.  Traditionally, the &#8220;package&#8221; was soldier support in the field and governemnt arsenals or depots in the US or rear arears.  The &#8220;package&#8221; created by the acquisition manager included not only designing and producing the system with qualities like reliability and maintenance, but delivering efficient repair instructions, supply lists, tools, trained manpower and facilities to repair things.  Often in the acquisition wars the &#8220;package&#8221; is not bought because cost over runs elsewhere take the programmed money.  Redoing shoddy work in one area always is more important than delivering the &#8220;package&#8221; to sustain the weapons..</p></blockquote>
<p>From my observations contractor supplied PBL was a band-aid developed because weapons bought during the Reagan build up, and the few in the Clinton administration, were poor quality, failed to meet their reliability and no one had any money left to develop the &#8220;package&#8221;.  It does not appear to be any better in this build up.</p>
<p>PBL, as criticized by GAO, was used to give the consequences of living with the trashy &#8220;package&#8221; back to the prime contractor.  This reflects the trend toward using the contractor rather than the government&#8217;s sustainment systems, as reflected in 2Slugbaits comment.  </p>
<p>The band-aid failed as the contractors  who did not develop the &#8220;package&#8221; in the first place were attempting to provide the &#8220;package&#8221; and profiting from their shoddy work.  The underlying problem is that the contractors did not have workable &#8220;packages&#8221; in their pockets when they signed up for PBL.  With no &#8220;packages&#8221; GAO found they failed to deliver cost savings or weapons that worked in the field.</p>
<p>A further cause of this waste was the drawdown in the 90&#8217;s meant fewer weapons were going to be built so the contractor facilities would become vacant and should be used for repairs.</p>
<p>Wrongfully, DoD expected to save money by not developing repair processes and avoiding acquiring government repair facilities and depots.</p>
<p>The cost of those savings were&#8230;..</p>
<p>          Lost capability and huge overruns for the shoddy work.</p>
<p>May as well hire whittlers to sustain the Army.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />This one by ilsm</p>

<p>An audience member mentioned that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/not-painless-or-theres-no-way-i-could.html">Tom Disch</a> wrote <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0647099/">an episode of Miami Vice</a>, featuring James Brown.</p>
<p>Also appearing was Chris Rock, four years before <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0102526/">New Jack City</a> made him a movie star.</p>
<p>Anyone who can tell me about the episode?  If not, consider this an open thread.</p>

<p>As the Chinese economy moves from agriculture to producing more goods and services, two things have happened.  Energy demand has gone up:

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>It is very interesting to go to conservative and/or libertarian blogs and encounter the comments on public education. So often you run across the statements about how the cost of education is rising and that they take some quote about rising real cost as absolute proof of their beliefs that politicians and the teachers unions are destroying the education system. As far as they seem to believe this is an argument stopper and that all they have to do is quote the numbers.</p>
<p>The numbers they quote are generally accurate. Education is an interesting industry. Despite all the advances of the computer revolution no one seems to have improved on the age-old system of the teacher sitting on one end of the log and the pupil on the other end. There has been no improvement or growth in productivity in public education. As a matter of fact one of the major metrics defining good education is a lower student-teacher ratio. But a lower teacher-student ratio means the the teachers productivity has fallen.</p>
<p>So we have a basic problem of having to pay teachers competitive salaries that are always rising in todays world while teacher productivity is flat to declining. The economic consequence has to be rising education cost. the best data on this I&#8217;ve been able to find is from the National Education Statistics published by the Department of Education. They report that since 1981 that nominal expenditures per student have grown at an annual rate of 5.9%.</p>
<p>Libertarians and/or conservatives seem to find this nearly 6% growth in expenditures per student to be proof that the politicians and teachers unions are destroying the system.</p>
<p>Maybe. But you need to put this number in perspective. If the public schools are doing so badly, how are the private schools doing? It turns out that we have a very good source of data on tuition and fees in private elementary and high schools. It is an individual line item in the CPI.<br />This shows that since 1981 tuition and fees at private elementary and high schools has been growing at an average annual rate of 7.7%, or about 30% faster than expenditures per pupil at<br />public elementary and high schools. Over this period the CPI reports that prices for college tuition and fees had almost an identical pattern as private elementary and high schools.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SIOeKKOALoI/AAAAAAAAAT0/wFinl43I2Gs/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SIOeKKOALoI/AAAAAAAAAT0/wFinl43I2Gs/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" border="0"></a>So I always take great pleasure of asking those citing rising education cost as proof of their position what does it mean that prices are rising about 30% faster in the private sector. The responses are always amusing.</p>
<p>About the only responsible and/or intelligence response I&#8217;ve seen is that private schools are cheaper than public schools. Again that is a maybe.</p>
<p>According to the Department of Education in the 1999-2000 school year spending per pupil in public schools was $8,033 while the average tuition &#038; fees at private elementary and high schools was $6,770. Since this is only 85% of public spending they are right. But if you look at the details you find:</p>

</table>
<p>So religious schools are cheaper, but tuition and fees at non-sectarian schools were 154% of public expenditures per student. The churches often subsidize their schools by providing the capital cost of the building and finding highly motivated individuals to volunteer and other ways.</p>
<p>As an aside, their was a CATO study in the mid 1990s that pointed out that the data on public spending per student did not include the capital cost of school. The Department of Education recognized this as a valid criticism and corrected their data, so the data I&#8217;m citing does include capital cost.</p>
<p>So we really come down to the bottom line that comparing elementary and high school cost between public and private schools is that the private schools do significantly worse than the public schools. I wonder what their equivalent of the teachers unions are?</p>

<blockquote><p>CARTER: Point one: I am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the United States. Beginning this moment, this nation will never use more foreign oil than we did in 1977 &#8212; never&#8230; </p>
<p>Point two: To ensure that we meet these targets, I will use my presidential authority to set import quotas&#8230;</p>
<p>Point three: To give us energy security, I am asking for the most massive peacetime commitment of funds and resources in our nation&#8217;s history to develop America&#8217;s own alternative sources of fuel&#8230;</p>
<p>I will soon submit legislation to Congress calling for the creation of this nation&#8217;s first solar bank, which will help us achieve the crucial goal of 20 percent of our energy coming from solar power by the year 2000.</p>
<p>These efforts will cost money, a lot of money, and that is why Congress must enact the windfall profits tax without delay&#8230;</p>
<p>Point four: I&#8217;m asking Congress to mandate, to require as a matter of law, that our nation&#8217;s utility companies cut their massive use of oil by 50 percent within the next decade and switch to other fuels, especially coal, our most abundant energy source&#8230;</p>
<p>Point five: To make absolutely certain that nothing stands in the way of achieving these goals, I will urge Congress to create an energy mobilization board&#8230;</p>
<p>Point six: I&#8217;m proposing a bold conservation program to involve every state, county, and city and every average American in our energy battle. This effort will permit you to build conservation into your homes and your lives at a cost you can afford.</p>
<p>To further conserve energy, I&#8217;m proposing tonight an extra $10 billion over the next decade to strengthen our public transportation systems&#8230;</p>
<p>Our nation must be fair to the poorest among us, so we will increase aid to needy Americans to cope with rising energy prices. We often think of conservation only in terms of sacrifice. In fact, it is the most painless and immediate way of rebuilding our nation&#8217;s strength. Every gallon of oil each one of us saves is a new form of production. It gives us more freedom, more confidence, that much more control over our own lives&#8230;</p>
<p>I do not promise you that this struggle for freedom will be easy. I do not promise a quick way out of our nation&#8217;s problems, when the truth is that the only way out is an all-out effort. What I do promise you is that I will lead our fight, and I will enforce fairness in our struggle, and I will ensure honesty. And above all, I will act. We can manage the short-term shortages more effectively and we will, but there are no short-term solutions to our long-range problems. There is simply no way to avoid sacrifice.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Rumors are rife that the farmer suicide pandemic hitting India is directly related to Monsanto, Cargill, and Syngenta&#8211;multinational agri-business (over 17,000 suicides in 2003 alone&#8230;and the rate is apparently increasing.) What is happening <a href="http://www.countercurrents.org/glo-shiva050404.htm">here?</a><br />
<blockquote>In 1998, the World Bank&#8217;s structural adjustment policies forced India to open up its seed sector to global corporations like Cargill, Monsanto, and Syngenta. The global corporations changed the input economy overnight. Farm saved seeds were replaced by corporate seeds which needed fertilizers and pesticides and could not be saved.<br />As seed saving is prevented by patents as well as by the engineering of seeds with non-renewable traits, seed has to be bought for every planting season by poor peasants. A free resource available on farms became a commodity which farmers were forced to buy every year. This increases poverty and leads to indebtedness. </p></blockquote>
<p>Which leads to suicide. Once hooked, forever caught. One irony is that some genetically modified seeds require more water than the homegrown varieties. In drought prone areas of India, such seeds became a disaster.</p>
<p>Take BT cotton (a GM product), for example: Cotton resistant to boltworm. It did work. Unfortunately, the new plants were then susceptible to attacks from other insects&#8230;so much so that <a href="http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/July06/Bt.cotton.China.ssl.html">farmers</a><br />
<blockquote>are now having to spray their crops up to 20 times a growing season to control them, according to the study of 481 Chinese farmers in five major cotton-producing provinces.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are reports of rashes and itching from BT cotton, to say nothing of the effect of all that pesticide on the local populace.</p>
<p>GE agri-products are now banned in the EU, but they still are finding their way into places like Pakistan&#8230;the road show has moved on. At the center of the problem lies the misleading studies of the efficacy of the seeds. A PR blitz, coupled with connections in high places, results in a successful shell game&#8230;until the locals either get wise or commit suicide after having been driven into poverty.</p>
<p>Of special concern are the terminator seeds, i.e., seeds that produce sterile plants, requiring the farmer to return to the multinational for more seeds. Terminator seeds should be outlawed. Not only do we threaten healthy biodiversity but also we simply condone an ever-greater transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich and powerful.</p>
<p>While I am certainly a devotee of science, I am leery of commercialized agri-science, where the seller does and then presents the studies. It took Mother Nature a long time to make food palatable for us. Tampering with Nature&#8217;s recipe should not be done lightly. And certainly the WTO should be cautious about being caterers to our new and questionable diet.</p>

                                <p>I don&#8217;t claim to have studied Medicare in depth. They send me the Reports in the same envelope with the Social Security Reports and I browse through them, but that is pretty much it. So this post is more of a call for people more informed on aspects of Medicare to chip in. But I want to throw out some basics. For those who want to follow along the 2008 Report can be found <a href="http://www.treas.gov/offices/economic-policy/reports/medicare-report-2008.pdf">here</a>:</p>
<p>First while there is no such thing as MedicareMedicaidSocial Security and while I firmly believe that the deliberate lumping of them together as &#8216;entitlements&#8217; is mostly a weasel-word effort that allows attacks on SS via the backdoor, there is a certain structural overlap. All six Social Security Trustees serve on the seven member Medicare Trustees board where they are joined by the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare &#038; Medicaid Services. Which means when we score the outlook for Social Security we are also in part scoring the outlook for Medicare crisis because the Medicare Trustees not surprisingly adopt the Intermediate Cost assumptions of the Social Security Trustees, after all they are not schizoids. This has some implications which I will get to after laying down a couple more basics.</p>
<p>First Medicare is not a single program with a single funding source, instead it is made up of Medicare Parts A, B, C &#038; D.</p>
<p>Medicare Part A is Hospital Insurance and is paid for through payroll tax deductions, 3.01% in 2006. This tax differs from that of Social Security in one respect: it is not capped. But for the most part the better Social Security performs on the revenue side, the better Part A and its HI Trust Fund do, in short they track and overall we have seen the same progress in pushing out dates of Trust Fund Depletion. Somebody can fact check me on this but I believe that when Clinton entered office HI Trust Fund depletion was scheduled for 1999 or about seven years of cushion. By the 2007 Report that date had been pushed back to 2019, which was an increase of a full year over 2006. Why the improvement? Well the Trustees tell us it was &#8220;due to slightly higher projected payroll tax income and slightly lower benefits than previously estimated&#8221;. In other words their revenue model was too pessimistic, they used Intermediate Cost. Now the 2008 Report reports that Trust Fund Depletion is still scheduled for 2019 but several months earlier in the year than the 2007. Why the slight deterioration? &#8220;due to slightly lower projected payroll tax income and slightly higher projected benefits than previously estimated. For the 75-year projection period, the actuarial deficit is virtually the same as in last year’s report, at 3.54 rather than 3.55 percent of taxable payroll. &#8221; I don&#8217;t know the reason for the slightly higher projected benefits, but the reduced payroll tax income can be explained in three words: &#8216;crappy fourth quarter&#8217;. Social Security OAS was on track to beat revenue expectations right through September, then the floor fell out.</p>
<p>But the larger picture remains the same, if the economy outperforms Intermediate Cost then the Medicare HI Trust Fund gains more revenue and the outlook should improve. This is complicated somewhat by medical inflation, if most of your overall GDP growth is coming from increased medical costs then the net might end up negative. Which is where you readers come in, any thoughts on how this offsets?</p>
<p>Medicare Parts B, C, &#038; D are mostly funded via the General Fund suplemented by premiums from beneficiaries. Part B is Doctors, Part C is Medicare Advantage (private insurance alternative) and Part D is Drugs. As General Fund programs they are not particularly walled off in the way Part A is with results we saw playing out last week.</p>
<p>Opponents of Medicare don&#8217;t have much of an opening on the Part A side, not when its financial health has been improving even if the face of soaring medical costs overall. And you only have to pick up the paper or know someone who has been hosptialized for even invasive surgery. Chances are pretty good you get maybe one night and boom out you go.</p>
<p>Which leaves them left to attack B, C, &#038; D. Which leaves them in a quandary. Part D is a Bush initiative and hugely favorable to Big Pharma, while Part C is hugely favorable to private insurance companies. Which leaves Part B-Doctors. So how did they propose to do this? Follow me briefly below the fold.</p>
<p>It was rather diabolical really. Prior to the introduction of Part C &#038; D costs were roughly split between A &#038; B with A being the bigger brother of the two. And given their different roles and different funding schemes there was little reason to cross compare them. If a doctor getting paid under B was able to give in office care in a way that avoided hospitalization then A saves some money while the spending ratio shifts towards B. On the other hand if B is not taking Medicare patients you may have to wait for that stroke to kick in before being able to get hopitalized under A, at much higher cost thus sending the A/B ratio the other way. While I&#8217;ll defer to others on the cost specifics (S-T-R?) it would seem to the outside observer that keeping people out of the hospital (A) via preventive care (B) and simple generic medications for heart and chloesterol (D) would have to be cheaper than the alternative. On balance it would seem that long term the goal should be to get the overall ratio of medical resources to A down and to B &#038; D up. Which is where the 45% rule steps in.</p>
<p>The 45% rule came in with the same bill that introduced Parts C &#038; D, the Medicare Modernization Act. You can see MMA&#8217;s basic provisions at Wiki. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Prescription_Drug,_Improvement,_and_Modernization_Act<br />But to see discussion of the 45% rule try this: http://www.ncpssm.org/news/archive/vp_45_percent_trigger/</p>
<p>What the 45% rule does is establish a trigger. As soon as the General Fund share of Medicare hits 45% then cuts to Part B are created immediately. Note not to Parts C &#038; D, both equally funded by the General Fund, that would take away from the Insurance Industry and Big Pharma. Nope lets pass the entire cost onto doctors.</p>
<p>Well that is just nutty. If this trigger were based on some overall share of GDP then it would make some sense but instead it is based on a ratio between the various components that is not directly related to overall deterioration or improvement in the health care system. If Doctor B takes on ten new Medicare patients and is able to keep three of them out of the hospital by prescribing a $1 a day generic supplied by Pharmacist D, who cares if Hospital Administrator A doesn&#8217;t get to bill medicare. We got three less people with heart attacks or strokes. Yet under the 45% rule the better preventive care gets the closer you get to the trigger. Counterproductive doesn&#8217;t begin to describe it. Unless of course your real goal is to force doctors to turn away Medicare patients to start with and so prove that this program is just another example of &#8216;Big Government is the Problem&#8217;.</p>
<p>Why do I say diabolical? Because they doubled down. First they set up a totally irrelevant ratio between A &#038; B and then saddled the B side with additional obligations in the way of C &#038; D and so practically guaranteeing the trigger. The system was set up to fail an artificial test and so pave the way for privatization under insurance company friendly Part C. Maybe others can see this in some other light, which I guess is what comments are for.</p>
<p>Health care mavens? (And don&#8217;t hesitate to comment or pose a question about Social Security, I just didn&#8217;t have a dedicated SS post prepared.)</p>
