                                <p>I don&#8217;t like talking about stocks. I believe the market is rigged, that the allocations do not favor the investor who is not also a senior executive of the company and/or a member of the Board of Directors, and that reported profits and losses on a quarterly basis is a lousy way to run a company.  And those are the moderate objections on a good day.*</p>
<p>That said, I have occasionally commented at Marginal Utility on the wisdom of investing in stocks. When not citing <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/moneymag_archive/2001/07/01/305196/index.htm">this article</a>, I often <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2006/06/interlude-1b-how-cheap-is-market.html">reprint a graphic</a> from Burton Malkiel&#8217;s <em>A Random Walk Down Wall Street</em>:
<p><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3858/72/1600/malkiel257%20PE.0.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3858/72/400/malkiel257%20PE.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>This one is fairly easy to explain: when P/E multiples are running high in the market, mean reversion tends to happen.  No allocation requirements, no changes in attitude or latitude at the drop of a FedFunds rate: just reasonable odds of whether you will make money on the investment.</p>
<p>(Doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t make money, just means it&#8217;s &#8220;the way to bet.&#8221;)</p>
<p>So it comes as little surprise when Felix cites <a href="http://www.passionsaving.com/stock-valuation.html">&#8220;a handy tool&#8221; by Rob Bennett</a> &#8220;based on one of Robert Shiller&#8217;s favorite indicators, P/E10, or price to previous ten years&#8217; average earnings&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now, P/E10 is at about 22, which mean that stocks are expensive, by historical standards: Rob reckons that fair value, for stocks, is about 14 or 15, and that anything above 20 is &#8220;truly dangerous&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>There have been three occasions when we have gone to P/E10 levels above 20. On those three occasions, the average loss in the years that followed was 68 percent. So the general rule is to lower your stock allocation when the P/E10 level goes above 20.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Felix goes on to note several catches that amount to &#8220;past history is not necessarily a predictor of future events&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>For one thing, I just don&#8217;t think that many investors have anything like the requisite amount of patience needed &#8211; where you can happily sit back for a decade or two waiting for the P/E10 to come down to the mid-teens before going overweight equities.</p>
<p>And for another thing, I&#8217;m far from convinced that the behavior of the stock market a century ago, when both the world and corporate capital structures were very different from how they look now, can really teach us much about stock-market investing. I don&#8217;t believe that the stock-market asset class has rules which govern its long-term behavior, and I can easily believe that we will never again see the S&#038;P 500 trading on a P/E10 of less than 15. (It&#8217;s already been 20 years, and I certainly don&#8217;t believe that discount rates are likely to go back up to their 1988 levels any time soon.)</p></blockquote>
<p>But in the end, his argument comes down to the core issue of investing:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;ve worried for a while that stocks aren&#8217;t an attractive asset class any more. The problem, of course, is that there&#8217;s not very much in the way of alternatives. And in any case, according to Rob, if I put all my money in stocks today, I can expect a real return of 5.65% over the next 30 years; 4.65% would be unlucky. I&#8217;d be happy with that, I think.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you want to know why we occasionally get speculative bubbles in various markets, there may be no better explanation than that paragraph.</p>
<p>*I have no problem with the Churchillian assertion that it is &#8220;better than all others,&#8221; but taking that as a sign of encouragement requires a Pollyannaish, or at least <a href="http://www.j-bradford-delong.net/movable_type/BDK-BPEA.pdf">DeLongian</a> [PDF], temperament.</p>

<p>AKA</p>
<p><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/print?id=5257935">&#8216;Her Way&#8217;</a>; Obama Health Plan Could Go In Clinton&#8217;s Direction<br />Teddy Davis, John Santucci and Gregory Wallace  ABC News  06.29.2008</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama&#8217;s surrogate [Dr. Kavita Patel] made her comments Wednesday while representing him at a National Journal health-policy forum moderated by Ron Brownstein, the political director of Atlantic Media.</p>
<p>Patel&#8217;s individual mandate remarks were made in response to an insurance industry leader suggesting at the same forum that insurers will oppose Obama&#8217;s plan as currently structured. Insurers are worried that the Illinois Democrat has not tied an individual mandate to &#8220;guaranteed issue,&#8221; the industry&#8217;s term for requiring patients to be covered without regard to pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve had the conversation about . . . guaranteed issue,&#8221; said Karen Ignagni, the president and CEO of America&#8217;s Health Insurance Plans. &#8220;But we are prepared to have that conversation in the insurance industry <bold>if</bold> the politicians are ready to stand up and say <bold>we are going to get everyone in.&#8221;</bold></p>
<p>Ignagni&#8217;s words are watched closely because the organization she heads emerged from the Health Insurance Association of America, sponsors of the &#8220;Harry and Louise&#8221; ads which played a critical role in killing Clinton&#8217;s effort to reform health-care in the 1990s.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn&#8217;t see that coming, but I should have. Obama&#8217;s plan has the part consumers like but has the problem that it would bankrupt the health insurance industry. Hmmm what if his plan was to terrify them into accepting universal health insurance with the public sector allowed to compete ? Current proposal sounds lovely. It would make it advantageous to the young and healthy to wait till they get sick to get insurance. The problem is that it could cause the industry to enter a death spiral.</p>
<p>But it sounds lovely. Do you want to bet your industry on your ability to stop the 46 year old African American major party nominee whose middle name is Hussein and who beat the police and the newly elected Democratic governor in a *unanimous* Illinois senate vote ? Better to deal I&#8217;d say. Maybe, just maybe, Ignagni really agrees with me that opposing Obama on a superficially appealing plan whose only fault is that it will destroy her industry is not a bright move.</p>
<p>And look at the headline from <a href="http://www.greenchange.org/"> Green Change</a>. We have Obama caving to the health insurance industry by accepting 100% universal health insurance (sort of like the time that he <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2007/11/i-agree-with-ed-kilgore-and-disagree.html">adopted Republican talking points</a> by proposing his donut social security funding huge progressive tax increase, class war, soak the rich and spread it out thin plan).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if he is is just brilliant or is also blessed.</p>

                                <p>Tyler Cowen takes <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2008/07/marriage_and_ca_1.html">a premise of Arnold Kling&#8217;s</a>:<br />
<blockquote>My guess is that most of the younger (aged 30-34) highly-educated folks are children of two highly-educated parents. My guess is that many of the older (aged 55-59) highly-educated folks are children of a college-educated father but not a college-educated mother.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we have a recipe that says, &#8220;Take a child of two non-college educated parents, add primary education ingredient X, bake, and out comes a college-capable high school graduate.&#8221; The mystery ingredient X has yet to be discovered.</p></blockquote>
<p>and <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/07/what-is-mystery.html">spins it as well as he can</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;m not sure that college education per se is the key here (and probably Arnold would agree; read his phrasing carefully).  If you can bake up some low rates of time preference, you&#8217;re coming pretty close to the real mystery ingredient.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, I&#8217;ll stick here for the answer that Kling alludes to without mentioning it: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GI_Bill">The (original) G.I. Bill</a>, which is the reason many of those 55-59-year-olds had a college-educated father in the first place.</p>

<p>It would seem that the new and excellent blog by <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/07/first-reactions-to-mccains-jobs-for-america-plan/#comment-551">EconomistMom</a> has already been infested by one Patrick R. Sullivan.  Yes, she has to endure Donald Luskin’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0002430">Mini-Me</a> like the rest of us – alas.  On Phil Gramm – Luskin’s Mini-Me writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>From there, he authored the spending controls in the Budget Act of 1990. Those controls were ultimately responsible for the budget surpluses of the late 90s. McCain having him as an adviser is more telling than anything in this political press release.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation – we switched from deficits to surpluses because we reduced nondefense Federal spending – right?  WRONG!  We switched from deficits to surpluses for two reasons: (1) Federal taxes as a share of GDP rose from 18.6% to 20.9%; and (2) defense spending as a share of GDP fell from just over 6.4% to less than 3.8%.  While it is true that total Federal spending as a share of GDP fell, the nondefense component actually rose.  </p>
<p>Of course, we have to routinely endure another rightwing troll named FA who made this comment about what EconomistMom wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>However, the quote she is attacking says 1997, and taxes WERE cut in 1997, the Capital Gains tax was cut.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, EconomistMom knows this but she was talking about the 1993 income tax rate increase, which was the primary reason why Federal taxes as a share of GDP rose.  When this is pointed out to our resident troll, he comes back with this Laugher:</p>
<blockquote><p>taxes WERE cut and it wasn&#8217;t until after that cut that the economy had stellar growth</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC!</strong>  Of course, FA cannot point to a single economic analysis that would attribute real GDP growth exclusively or even partially to the 1997 reduction in the tax rate on capital gains.  I have to wonder how much the GOP pays these two village idiots.  Let’s hope it’s less than the minimum wage – otherwise, they are paying much more than these two dimwits are worth.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I am aware that the American Council for Capital Formation had DRI prepare something called “Capital Gains Taxes and the Economy: A Retrospective Look” back in June of 1999.  ACCF is an advocacy group so I would question whether something prepared on their behalf qualifies as an economic analysis.  But let’s go back to something from <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/9-20-01tax.htm">CBPP</a> entitled Would a Capital Gains Tax Cut Stimulate The Economy? published on September 20, 2001 when policymakers were last worried about a recession:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some Congressional leaders are promoting a proposal to reduce the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains from 20 percent to 15 percent. This reduction in the capital gains rate is being championed as a way to stimulate the economy. A reduction in the capital gains tax rate, however, is highly unlikely to provide a stimulus. In fact, it offers one of the least appropriate responses to the nation&#8217;s current economic challenges. Advocates of a capital gains tax cut have not traditionally claimed it has a stimulus effect. In the past, they have argued that it would provide long-term, rather than short-term, benefits for the economy. Even these long-run benefit arguments are weak. The Congressional Budget Office and other respected analysts have found that a capital gains tax cut would have very little impact on economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>How could anyone suggest that the 1997 reduction in capital gains tax rate was responsible for the economic boom of the 1990’s?  Oh yea – trolls are told by their political masters what to think!</p>

                                <p>UPDATE:  Brad DeLong lists some of the Usual Suspects <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/07/republican-econ.html">who are Not in the Line-up</a>.</p>
<p>John McCain&#8217;s <a href="http://johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/Read.aspx?guid=c90681b9-5dfe-4de4-8057-ceedb30c228d">300 economists</a> who support <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/mccains-claim-of-balancing-budget-dont.html">his Jobs for America Plan</a> (via Tyler Cowen, non-sociopath, who <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/07/statement-of-30.html">provides an appropriate context for the list</a>) includes one person, an Ike Brannon, whose affiliation is listed as &#8220;Department of the Treasury&#8221; and who, per <a href="http://www.treas.gov/organization/officials.html">this site</a>, is &#8220;Senior Advisor to the [Tax Policy] Assistant Secretary,&#8221; one <a href="http://www.treas.gov/organization/bios/solomon-e.html">Eric Solomon</a>.</p>
<p>My initial suspicion was that this might be a violation of the Hatch Act.  But that appears <a href="http://www.osc.gov/ha_fed.htm#may">not to be necessarily true</a>:<br />
<blockquote>These federal and D.C. employees may-</p>
<p>    * express opinions about candidates and issues<br />    * contribute money to political organizations<br />    * attend political fundraising functions<br />    * attend and be active at political rallies and meetings<br />    * join and be an active member of a political party or club<br />    * sign nominating petitions<br />    * campaign for or against candidates in partisan elections<br />    * make campaign speeches for candidates in partisan elections<br />    * distribute campaign literature in partisan elections<br />    * hold office in political clubs or parties</p></blockquote>
<p>So as long as Mr. Brannon didn&#8217;t sign the petition while &#8220;on duty [or] in a government office [or] using a government vehicle,&#8221; it appears he is clearly permitted to sign the petition.</p>
<p>Now, generally, these petitions are circulated through personal connections. So presumably someone knows Mr. Brannon and forwarded it to him at his personal e-mail address. And one would assume that Mr. Brannon, if he were enthusiastic about the petition, would forward it—in a manner not to violate the Hatch Act—to others, including co-workers.</p>
<p>And presumably those others would know that, so long as the contact was of a personal nature, they, too, could sign on to &#8220;support of John McCain&#8217;s Jobs for America economic plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The silence from the rest of the Treasury Department is deafening.</p>

<p>To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings;&#8211;And</p>

<p>But leave to mom, that is <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/07/first-reactions-to-mccains-jobs-for-america-plan">EconomistMom</a>, for a very in-depth early review.  </p>
<blockquote><p>Even with the lack of specificity, it’s all too obvious that the plan offers far more ways of adding to the deficit than of trimming the deficit, in virtually every section of the report–including, most annoyingly, the fiscal responsibility section on pages 4-5.</p></blockquote>
<p>She then proceeds to walk you through some of the specifics.  But it was this line under Bi-partisan Fiscal Discipline that would have led any mom to conclude that John McCain was lying at every turn:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1997, President Clinton and the GOP Congress agreed to balance the budget by restraining the growth in spending and cutting taxes over a ten-year period.</p></blockquote>
<p>EconomistMom fires back:</p>
<blockquote><p>the Clinton Administration did not achieve fiscal discipline by restraining spending and “cutting taxes.”  The Clinton Administration made the tough choices (and earlier than 1997) to restrain spending and raise taxes in order to achieve meaningful deficit reduction through both the spending and revenues side of the budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rightwing hacks that McCain now panders to predicted back in 1993 that the Clinton tax increase would lead to a recession.  I guess now that we know that economic growth was strong during the Clinton years, these same hacks want us to believe that Clinton’s term was one of tax cuts.  But this is so patently false – it is hard for me to believe that McCain put this into his economic plan.  Then again – this “plan” is so full of dishonesty that its National Review style of flat out lying to its readers should not surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: The <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTYzZTdmOTNjN2I4OWI0MGExZjYwNjBlMWIxZTkwNGY=">National Review</a> thinks balancing the budget is easy especially if we pass even more tax cuts:</p>
<blockquote><p>The sophisticates in the press will of course scoff that it is impossible to cut taxes while balancing the budget. But let’s not overestimate the difficulty of getting rid of the deficit.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an oped that calls for tax cuts for the middle class as well. This is beyond stupid.  Do the editors at the National Review have to take their shoes off just to count to four?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>After all the recent discussion of oil inventories and other arguments about the price of oil I thought I would throw another set of data and thoughts on the subject.  This chart compares the price of oil to the CRB Index of industrial commodity prices &#8212; an index of 13 major commodities that does not include any energy or food commodities. Both oil and the CRB are monthly average data.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SHN2EGrEo5I/AAAAAAAAASs/ICw_dzSjM6M/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SHN2EGrEo5I/AAAAAAAAASs/ICw_dzSjM6M/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Note how they move together. This CRB Index is a very good leading to concurrent index of oil prices.  It regularly peaks or bottoms ahead of or concurrently with oil prices.  I use the CRB as a leading indicator of world economic growth and global demand for oil and commodities.  Second, note how similar the increase in oil and other commodities has been. This comparison implies that there is little or nothing unusual about oil prices this cycle compared to other major cycles.  It is simply an issue of world demand out pacing supply.  There is no need for any theories of hoarding or producers leaving oil in the ground or peak oil to explain the surge in oil prices this cycle.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.theautomaticearth.blogspot.com/">The Automatic Earth</a> notes an article in the WSJ and says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Scores of banks were already suffering headaches by the end of the first quarter, according to a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121494953423420859.html?mod=hpp_us_whats">_newsreview by The Wall Street Journal</a> of FDIC-filed reports by 6,919 banks that make construction loans. The smallest banks, those with total assets of less than $5 billion, faced the biggest problems. The WSJ analysis didn&#8217;t include savings-and-loan institutions, or so-called thrift banks.</p>
<p>Nearly one in three of the banks analyzed &#8212; or 2,182 &#8212; had construction-loan portfolios that exceeded 100% of their total risk-based capital, a red flag to regulators, although it doesn&#8217;t mean the bank is in danger of failing. Risk-based capital is a cushion that banks can dig into to cover losses. Even more alarming, 73 of those banks had construction-loan delinquency rates of more than 25%. </p>
<p>Larger regional banks also face mounting construction-loan problems, but are in decent shape. Thirty-eight of them had more than 100% of their total risk-based capital in construction loans at the end of the first quarter, but only nine of those faced delinquency rates of more than 10%.</p>
<p>Over the next few quarters, banks are expected to begin recording much larger losses. In 2007 and the first quarter of this year, U.S. banks wrote down just 0.7% of their residential construction and land assets as bad debt, according to Zelman &#038; Associates, a research firm. Over the next five years that figure could rise to 10% and 26%, which would amount to about $65 billion to $165 billion, Zelman projects.</p></blockquote>
