                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14285172/">AP</a> reports on a PEW study on immigration and Americans taking jobs or not:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. had 28 million immigrants _ legal and illegal _ age 16 and older in 2000, an increase of 61 percent from 1990. By 2004, there were 32 million.</p>
<p>Immigrants tend to be younger and have less education than American workers. The study, however, found &#8220;no apparent relationship between the growth of foreign workers with less education and the employment outcome of native workers with the same low level of education.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The PEW study did not look at impact on wages. I wonder what predisposes us to first think of &#8216;too lazy&#8217; versus &#8216;low wages&#8217; or such as first thought? And given the lack of popular research, why policy seems uninformed? <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/immigration-debate-labor-shortages-and.html">Lazy millionaires</a> ?</p>
<p>A lot of examples of how immigrants gain work is taken from day labor or migrant labor. Then there is a claim that educated Americans do not take jobs as in high tech areas by another set of businesses.   How can this be framed in some more accurate way?</p>
<p>Update:  reader David links to some good information <a href="http://fiordiliji.sourceoecd.org/pdf/factbook2008/302008011e-01-03-02.pdf">here for a look at comparisons to other countries</a> and definitions of &#8216;immigrant&#8217;.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ford.co.uk/ie/all_cars/all_cars/-/-/-/-/-">Ford a la Europe</a> has a range of vehicles considered reliable with good gas mileage compared to US models.  There are plans to sell here, but marketers are very cautious about how they might be received.  Why might Americans be reluctant?</p>

                                <p>If anyone has had to endure Lawrence Kudlow’s cheerleading as to how wages have continued to grow, I would at least hope that you recognized that this National Review nitwit was talking about nominal wages and not real wages.  Well, it seems that his good buddy &#8211; <a href="http://www.poorandstupid.com/2008_06_01_chronArchive.asp#8731350295144373516">Donald Luskin</a> is similarly challenged about this incredibly basic economic concept:</p>
<blockquote><p>From the Krugman column yesterday: “In fact, wage growth actually seems to be slowing” Hasn’t he been telling us for 7 years that wages have been going down? How then is wage growth suddenly slowing?</p></blockquote>
<p>Time to turn the microphone over to <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/07/yes-it-is-donal.html">Brad DeLong</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The answer, of course, is simple: Measured real wages&#8211;that is, the number of dollars you have paid divided by the price level&#8211;have been at best flat or falling for almost this entire decade. That is because measured nominal wages&#8211;how many dollars you get paid&#8211;have been growing more slowly than prices. And just now the rate of nominal wage growth has been falling.  If you understand that real wages and nominal wages are two different things, you don&#8217;t get confused.  Does Luskin understand this? I think not. I remember a similar mistake from the past: Luskin&#8217;s attempt to compute the real exchange rate</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ll let you check out the rest – but tell me something.  Why does anyone bother to listen to either village idiot (Kudlow or Luskin)?</p>

                                <p>UPDATE:  NYT Obituary <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/08/books/08disch.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;ref=obituaries&#038;pagewanted=print">here</a>.  Some book cover images added.
<p>Two years ago at <a href="http://www.readercon.org/">Readercon</a>, I found myself doing some hero-worship in the Green Room.</p>
<p>Friday, we had discovered that my piece on Jorge Luis Borges was the first of the appreciations of that year&#8217;s Memorial Guest of Honor.  (I assume this was because of its length.)  Saturday, Shira and I had interviewed living GoH <a href="http://www.jamesmorrow.net/">Jim Morrow</a>.  Sunday afternoon was going to be for seeing old friends.</p>
<p>Sunday morning, I came out of a panel, and there was Tom Disch, sitting alone in the Green Room.*</p>
<p>So I got five minutes—maybe ten—of getting to bubble over about &#8220;The Cardinal Detoxes&#8221; and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wings-Song-Thomas-M-Disch/dp/0312584660/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1215391714&#038;sr=1-4">On Wings of Song</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Black-Alice-Thom-Demijohn/dp/0112575226/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1215391767&#038;sr=1-1">Black Alice</a></em> and <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Castle-Indolence-Poetry-Poets-Poetasters/dp/0312145594/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1215391677&#038;sr=8-1">The Castle of Indolence</a></em>.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SHQJi1BkBGI/AAAAAAAAAIg/myWt3Lc9ejk/s1600-h/OnWingsofSong0001.gif"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SHQJi1BkBGI/AAAAAAAAAIg/myWt3Lc9ejk/s400/OnWingsofSong0001.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And he asked about why I was there, and I mumbled something, and Shira pointed out that I had written reviews for The Washington Post—to this man who had been the best reason to read <em>The Nation</em> for much of my early adult life.</p>
<p>And I asked about the rumors that he had stopped writing due to depression over his partner&#8217;s death (possibly not that directly), and he said he was still writing, and a few week&#8217;s later I found that he did indeed have some works scheduled to come out.  And I believed him.</p>
<p>But apparently, that <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/010413.html">stopped being true</a>.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m at all qualified to have the politics of an Angry Bear, <em>On Wings of Song</em> should get much of the credit. (The excesses are mine.)</p>

<p>*We had seen him on Friday night, having a pleasant dinner with Pamela Zoline, but that&#8217;s not a conversation one interrupts to hero-worship, even if you&#8217;re not trying to ride herd over two children in a dark bar.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Lets take a trip in Mr. Wizard&#8217;s Way Back Machine all the way to the year 2000. At that point we see Social Security geek Webb jumping in excitement (being one of the few people in history to get excited over Social Security financials). What is the source of this rather odd behavior? Well it came from an examination of the following number series.<br />1996&#8212;2029<br />1997&#8212;2029<br />1998&#8212;2032<br />1999&#8212;2034<br />2000&#8212;2037<br />Now when the Report was released in March 2000 it was certainly plausible that the next January would see the swearing in of President Gore. At that point no one had really heard of hanging chads or Diebold. Anyway it was reasonable to consider the long term implications of these dates.</p>
<p>The first column is Report Year, the second column projected Trust Fund Depletion, at that point in time the standard measure for &#8216;Crisis&#8217;. Now you can look at this series as being an improvement of eight years over a four year period (March 1996 to March 2000) which gives you an improvement rate of 2 years per year, or you can push the envelope and date the improvement over three years (March 1997 to March 2000) which gives you a rate of 2 2/3 per year, but it really doesn&#8217;t matter for our purposes. Because an event that retreats out on average at even one year per year is an event that never comes, if that rate is doubled that event rapidly recedes over the event horizon. Okay lets imagine President Gore approaching the end of his second term in 2008 having overseen a similar improvement at the 2 year per year rate in Depletion date. This would put depletion in the year 2053. A little calculation and we can see that Boomers would be ranging in age from 89 to 107, a point in time in which the mortality tables suggest more than half of our youngest cohort (the birth class of 64) will be dead. The suggestion that Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217;, at least as it was defined in 2000, as being caused by Boomer Retirement would be just as dead.</p>
<p>Okay remembering we are still in the year 2000, under a Democratic President committed to &#8216;Save Social Security First&#8217; and a Presidential Candidate committed to the same goal (though using the ultimately misleading metaphor of &#8216;Lock Box), what should have been the response to that number series? Well I&#8217;ll tell you, two questions should have been asked:</p>
<p>1) What caused the dates to change in the way they did? and<br />2) Can whatever caused the changes go on?</p>
<p>But I can tell you from experience that hardly anyone in a position of influence was asking that question, if fact if you separate out Dean Baker and Mark Weisbrot that number starts approaching zero. Which is why Baker and Weisbrot called their 1999 book <a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/035468.html">Social Security: the Phony Crisis</a>. If you follow me below the fold I am going to make a stab at answering the question of why these questions were not asked and then offer some answers to both.</p>
<p>Well the kindest answer is that after all those numbers were not in fact in the bag and that we should just defer to the professional judgement of the staff of the Office of the Chief Actuary as signed off by the Trustees of Social Security. After all in 2037 the Boomers would be ranging in age from 73 to 91 and would still be projected to having a major though declining impact on Social Security.</p>
<p>A more cynical answer is that Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; was in 2000 an advantage to both the Democratic Administration and its Republican opposition. For Clinton &#038; Gore &#8216;crisis&#8217; was largely defensive. Their argument was that tax cuts in the face of this impending crunch were reckless, and that far better would be to maintain budget restraint and pay down debt held by the public (which is what &#8216;Lock Box&#8217; actually boils down to operationally). On the other hand for the Republicans crisis was an advantage in three ways. One it was a nice poster child for their overall &#8216;Big Government is the Problem&#8217; narrative. Two its existence allowed them to push their then 64 year dream of killing Social Security in play. The third advantage was a little more subtle. Under their Supply Side theory the only real way to finance Social Security long term was to grow the economy through tax cuts, in their topsy-turvy world cutting taxes for the rich was simply a means to help out future elderly poor. Unfortunately their theory ran into trouble when it encountered our reality.</p>
<p>In the event asking those questions was not particularly convenient for either side at the time. Of course in the end the Republicans won the near term battle, they got to keep &#8216;crisis&#8217; in play and get their tax cuts anyway. Alright! Back in the Way Back Machine and lets take a trip forward to Nov. 2004. How has our number series held up? Well pretty good.<br />2000&#8212;2037<br />2001&#8212;2038<br />2002&#8212;2041<br />2003&#8212;2042<br />2004&#8212;2042<br />The rate of improvement certainly had slowed down, but still we had a total of five years of improvement over a four year period, moreover we got those pesky Boomers a little bit older and more out of the way. In 2042 they would be 78 to 96 and generally shuffling off the Buffalo and points beyond.</p>
<p>By 2004 those questions should have been being asked loudly and often:<br />1) What caused the dates to change in the way they did? and<br />2) Can whatever caused the changes go on?<br />Instead BushCo simply maintained the same stance they did back before 2000, they needed Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; in order to achieve their agenda, and their response was to cover their ears and shout &#8220;Wah, wah, wah. We can&#8217;t hear you!!&#8221;. Which didn&#8217;t save them during the &#8216;There is no Crisis&#8217; fight of 2005. But also didn&#8217;t make them give up their long term goals.</p>
<p>So what are the answers to the questions? Well lets dispose of the first typical answer, the dates of depletion did not change year over year because of changes in demographic assumptions. Those assumptions remained relatively stable over the period of Report years in question. There is no doubt that demography is hugely important in determining the long term outlook, but it has little impact on year to year reporting because generally speaking the fertility and mortality numbers were already baked into the cake.</p>
<p>Nope in examining the Reports year over year to see what changed from say 1999 to 2000 to cause a three year improvement in a single ear and the answer is clear: the economy did much, much better than projected. Moreover as Prof. Rosser and I have demonstrated in the past, the response in the Reporting was odd. In the face of continual underestimates of current year performance the reaction of the actuaries was to actually lower their projections going forward in what for the world looked like a pure effort to maintain &#8216;crisis&#8217;. This was particularly notable in the 2003 and 2004 Reports (see Tables V.B1 and V.B2). In particular rather inexplicable carving away at second year numbers went along with a milder slicing of current year numbers. The result as I showed in my Nov. 2004 post <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2004/11/what-is-low-cost-alternative-what-does.html">What is the Low Cost Alternative?</a>,  was Low Cost always returning the same operational result, Social Security funded but not over funded, a result which stayed constant through the 2007 Report year. (2008 shows Low Cost actually overfunding Social Security). So much for the first question: what changed? Economic growth numbers.</p>
<p>The answer to the second question is pretty easy, at least taken from when it was asked in 2000. Can this process continue? Absolutely because it did. The outlook for Social Security improved steadily from 2000 to 2003 because numbers on the whole came in better than expected. Now it is true that progress stalled in 2004 and actually went backwards in 2005 and 2006 only to improve again in 2007 and 2008 and we can if you like explore each of those Report years separately to see why that happened, but the general answer is that productivity stalled in such a way as to bring numbers more in line with Intermediate Cost than had been typical of the 1997 to 2003 period when outcomes closer or better than Low Cost. </p>
<p>(But all that goes to show you is that the idea that cutting taxes on the wealthy serves to boost investment and so productivity and so ultimately real wages for workers is not in fact supported by the actual numbers since the actual tax cut. But that would be to cut in on Spencer&#8217;s turf.)</p>
<p>Can productivity (or GDP or real wage or whatever interrelated measure you like) improve in ways that come in better than Intermediate Cost and so continue the longer range trend that would have Depletion (and so &#8216;crisis&#8217;) continue to move out in time. Well opinions vary. All I can say is that the people who were dismissive of Low Cost in the 1997 to 2003 period were all by the numbers proved to be wrong. When those same people insist that I just don&#8217;t get how ridiculous those assumptions are, I just have to ask &#8220;Well where were you when I was asking this question back in 2000?&#8221;</p>

                                <p>This year&#8217;s Olympics may well be a symbol or metaphor for rapid globalization. Sailing waters are choked with algae, a result of the chemical pollution; flotillas of boats are at work attempting to clear it so that sailors have at least a chance of moving off the starting line. As Bejiing grows, its water table continues to plummet. Attempts to supply the city with water may ultimately fail in the long term, according to <a href="http://redorbit.com/news/science/1454685/beijing_may_be_running_out_of_water/index.html">some</a>.</p>
<p>Chinese officials recently announced that tap water is now potable; the first city in China to receive that accolade. Some <a href="http://lioninoil.blogspot.com/2007/05/2008-beijing-olympics-bring-your-own.html">wags</a> are suggesting that you bring your own, just in case.</p>
<p>And then there is the air; we have all seen the pictures of people on the street with protective masks. <a href="http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=52585&#038;cat=6">Transworld News</a> has a cheery piece covering much of this as well as the questionable food.</p>
<p>Thus globalization proceeds apace under the watchful, environmentally conscious WTO.</p>

<p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/07/us-energy-consumption-as-percent-of-gdp.html">Calculated Risk</a> discusses problems with certain reports concerning per centage of GDP being reported for energy costs as unrealistic, predicting real per centages to be as high as 14% of GDP if prices stay the same or rise.</p>
<p>There is a human side to the increase a few months from now that will possibly be of greater concern than high gas prices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2008/06/28/northeast_braces_for_home_heating_oil_increases/">The Boston Globe</a> notes an upcoming problem for the Northeast home heating season. I have seen oil for $4.80 plus a gallon, up about $2.00 a gallon from last year. Assuming similar degree days from last season January (08) could mean an increase of 40% in the seasons heating bill.</p>
<p>Assuming the very warm winter of January 07, it would not be so bad when we had plants like forsythia blooming in January in the Boston area. Then again, a different winter such as January 06 saw 30 days of continuous 0 degree temperatures in January, so 40% would be a conservative estimate.</p>

<p>Hat tip to reader Henry Cobb.</p>
<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080706/bs_afp/germanychinagamesmanufacturingglobalisation">Yahoo news</a> has an article on new directions for globalization:</p>
<blockquote><p>In an effort to cut costs Steiff began outsourcing production to Chinese factories in 2004, and even sent 300 workers there to make sure the bears were up to scratch.</p>
<p>But this week Steiff called time on its Chinese adventure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are withdrawing from China step by step. For toys of high quality, China is simply not a reliable source,&#8221; the Stuttgarter Nachrichten newspaper quoted chief executive Martin Frechen as saying.</p>
<p>But for this privately owned company, whose teddies sell for up to 120 euros (190 dollars) each and which is trying to win back market share for its trademark bear with a button sewn into its ear, quality is everything.</p>
<p>The multi-billion dollar toy industry has been at the forefront of the massive shift of manufacturing to China where it can pay workers a fraction of what it pays them in the West.</p>
<p>Four out of five toys sold in Europe were made in a Chinese factory, and China exported 22 billion of them of them in 2006.</p>
<p>But problems with quality and a series of scares about safety has made firms a lot more wary.</p>
<p>In the most high profile episode, US toy giant Mattel recalled 21 million toys like Barbie dolls and Batman action figures last year over concerns about toxic lead paint and small magnets that children could choke on.</p>
<p>Mattel admitted later its problems were down to design more than manufacturing flaws, and Chinese authorities have since tightened quality controls and have cracked down on factories producing dangerous toys.</p>
<p>But safety and quality problems remain, and stricter import laws are having the effect of reducing the cost advantage of going east, firms say.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are going to be new regulations in the European Union,&#8221; said Ulrich Brobeil from the German toymakers association DVSI, so it is set to be &#8220;easier and cheaper to manufacture in Germany or in nearby countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The story is the same in other industries, as textile firms attest.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are feeling that there is a movement in this direction,&#8221; of &#8220;returning,&#8221; Silvia Jungbauer from the industry&#8217;s federation in Germany told AFP.</p>
<p>&#8220;Geographical proximity is playing a predominant role again, quality too,&#8221; Jungbauer said, and most importantly &#8220;cost in China have risen sharply in recent months.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wages for Chinese workers are going up and up, and oil prices above 140 dollars a barrel are also making it significantly pricier for container ships full of teddies and radio-controlled mini-helicopters to sail around the world.</p>
<p>In the past year alone, the cost of producing in China has risen 30 percent, estimates Reinhard Doepfer from the European Fashion and Textile Export Council.</p>
<p>Apart from Chine, &#8220;Albania, Macedonia and Serbia-Montenegro are the hot topics for German industry,&#8221; Doepfer said. &#8220;(But) I can&#8217;t see production coming back to Germany, no way.&#8221;</p>
<p>Indeed Steiff is not moving back to Germany, but to Portugal.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/06/us/06employer.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">Julia Preston</a> has a few anecdotes about employers who are supposedly having trouble attracting employees at market wages:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mike Gilsdorf, the owner of a 37-year-old landscaping nursery in Littleton, Colo., saw the need for action by businesses last winter when he advertised with the Labor Department, as he does every year, for 40 seasonal workers at market-rate wages to plant, prune and carry his shrubs in the summer heat. Only one local worker responded to the notice, he said, and then did not show up for the job. Mr. Gilsdorf was able to fill his labor force with legal immigrants from Mexico through a federal guest worker program. But that program has a tight annual cap, and Mr. Gilsdorf realized that he might not be so lucky next year. His business could fail, he said, and then even his American workers would lose their jobs.  “We’re not hiring illegals, we’re not paying under the table,” Mr. Gilsdorf said. “But if we don’t get in under the cap and nobody is answering our ads, we don’t have employees.” His group, Colorado Employers for Immigration Reform, is pressing Congress for a much larger and more flexible guest worker program … “I can’t replace those people,” the executive said. She said that despite offering competitive wages from $9 to $17 an hour, the company had failed over the years in repeated efforts to attract nonimmigrant workers because of the state’s tight technology labor market and because of the nature of the work, exacting and tedious. If the workers were fired or arrested, she said, she could fail to meet her contracts.</p></blockquote>
<p>This unnamed executive is reported to receive $20 million a year in compensation (late correction &#8211; no the article said it was $20 million company).  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=the_shortage_of_lowpaid_journa">Dean Baker</a> has a problem with this reporting:</p>
<blockquote><p>By contrast, the NYT tells us that many employers want to relax laws penalizing them for hiring undocumented workers because &#8220;they grappled, even in an economic downturn, with shortages of low-wage labor.&#8221; In a market economy, the response to shortages is higher prices, or in this case higher wages. While it is understandable that employers do not want to pay higher wages, just like most of us do not want to pay higher gas prices, that is the way a market works. If they cannot afford to pay higher wages, then in a market economy, they go out of business, just as tens of millions of inefficient businesses have gone out of business as the economy has grown over the last century. It would be helpful if the NYT would apply some basic economics to its discussion of this economic issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find it hard to sympathize with a CEO who receives $20 million a year (OK &#8211; we&#8217;re not sure what this CEO makes) but complains about not finding enough workers when her company is paying some workers less than $10 an hour.  Markets respond to labor shortages by increasing the compensation of workers.  Over the past 18 months, we have witnessed a fall in the employment to population ratio from 63.4% to 62.4%.  Over the same period, real wages for production and nonsupervisory workers has declined to the levels witnessed at the end of 2001.  Indeed we are facing another economic downturn at least from the perspective of the labor market.  I’m all for eventually relaxing immigration laws, but let’s not kid ourselves – more immigration during this period of labor market weakness is going to make the labor surplus more severe.</p>

                                <p>Over at the National Review – Mark Levin declares that the late Jesse Helms championed the causes of <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MjQyN2RhZmEzNGFhYmJmYTY2M2MxMzA3MGFlZGMwMDk=">abused minorities</a>.  More praise came from <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/nation/5872614.html">President Bush</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Jesse Helms was a kind, decent, and humble man and a passionate defender of what he called the Miracle of America.”</p></blockquote>
<p>If I were a conservative, I would likely agree with <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/07/helms-and-the-b.html">Andrew Sullivan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was nothing decent about the policy record of Jesse Helms.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/the_helms_legacy.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> sums up my thoughts:</p>
<blockquote><p>One fascinating thing about the death of Jesse Helms is the conservative reaction. One might expect that Helms&#8217; death would prompt from conservatives the sorts of things that I might say if, say, Al Sharpton died &#8212; that he and I had some overlapping beliefs and I don&#8217;t regard him as the world-historical villain that the right does, but that he&#8217;s a problematic guy and I regard him and his methods as pretty marginal to American liberalism. But instead conservatives are taking a line that I might have regarded as an unfair smear just a week ago, and saying that Helms is a brilliant exemplar of the American conservative movement.  And if that&#8217;s what the Heritage Foundation and National Review and the other key pillars of American conservatism want me to believe, then I&#8217;m happy to believe it. But it reflects just absolutely horribly on them and their movement that this is how they want to be seen &#8212; as best exemplified by bigotry, lunatic notions about foreign policy, and tobacco subsidies.</p></blockquote>
<p>If I were a conservative – I’d also be embarrassed by the serial nonsense published by the Heritage Foundation and National Review.</p>
