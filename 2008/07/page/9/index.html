<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/blogs/entry/5183/3">OMB Watch</a> for the post on dueling papers and economists on our future federal budget dilemmas. (Most of us are ignoring the state level shortfalls to date&#8230;rdan)</p>
<p>Drawing a picture by numbers&#8230;what the <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/media/Files/rc/papers/2008/04_fiscal_future/04_fiscal_future.pdf">Brookings/Heritage</a> people did not say.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cbpp.org/7-9-08bud.pdf">The Center on Budget Policy Priorities</a> has issued its <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/blogs/entry/5183/3">own report</a> on beginning to solve the possible future budget crisis.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the next 75 years, the costs of making the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent is 3½ times the size of the Social Security shortfall. The Social Security trustees project that the Social Security imbalance will equal 0.56 percent of the Gross Domestic Product over the next 75 years. Based on Joint Tax Committee and Social Security Administration estimates, the costs of extending the tax cuts is approximately 1.95 percent of GDP over the same period.4 Indeed, just the cost of extending the tax cuts for the top 1 percent of Americans — those with incomes over $450,000 — exceeds the entire Social Security shortfall.(5)</p></blockquote>
<p>(4.includes part of the AMT fix).  What makes the donut proposal attractive with these kinds of numbers???</p>
<p>I do wonder why so many appear so concerned about responsibility but are simply arguing to increase or maintain their share of the pie. I included only this part of the report because we forgot to compare tax cut maintenance and SS shortfall arguments, two hot buttons of contention with little data used.  I really hope comments are not simply statements of idealogy, but are reasoned from reality and real behavior, not ideal this and that.</p>
<p>There are lots of implications between the two reports, so I assume more posts will follow from the Angry Bears.</p>
<p>Update:  I picked the quote from the CBPP report for my own purposes of comparing <strong>emoticons </strong>in what passes for discourse sometimes.  It is not a reflection of the report, nor a synopsis.</p>

                                <p>It seems <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=N2M3YWQ5MTE3Yzc0ZmY3OGM1YmU0OTVhZWUwZjQ0ZTk=">Mark Hemingway</a> understands what escaped Movie Guy <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/did-jonah-goldberg-learn-about.html">earlier</a> &#8211; several events can affect oil prices:</p>
<blockquote><p>After trading at a record high of $147 a barrel Friday, the price of oil saw its largest one-day drop since the 2003 beginning of the Iraq war on Tuesday, falling $6.44 a barrel. Wednesday, it fell another $3.71, to $135.03, and at one point was trading as low as $132. So what happened? As is usually the case with markets, a variety of factors caused this dramatic drop. According to the Associated Press, the Energy Information Administration announced that U.S. crude-oil supplies rose by 3 million barrels; beleaguered banks have been selling off valuable energy contracts to pay for other debts; and there’s even some speculation that computer programs used by Wall Street may create a “cascading effect” once prices start to drop.  But bizarrely, the AP didn’t mention that on Monday — again, the day of the single biggest one-day drop in oil prices in five years — President Bush removed the executive order imposing a moratorium on offshore drilling in the United States. To think that this dramatic and unexpected move by the Bush administration didn’t have a significant effect on oil prices is folly. Even Democrats admit that relatively small margins in oil production could have a huge impact on prices. “If they [Saudi Arabia] produced half a million barrels more oil a day the price would come down a very significant amount and, at the same time, it would stop the speculation that keeps driving up the price of oil,” Sen. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) said on the Senate floor Wednesday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where to begin with all the silly implied assertions here?  Sure a price decline equal to $15 a barrel begs an explanation.  But how does Hemingway know that what the EIA has described cannot account for all of this $15 decline?  Secondly, the fact that President Bush has removed his executive order does not imply that companies are free to do offshore drilling.  Congress has to act as well.  So at best, the decision by Bush (which likely surprised no one) only increased the probability that this ban will be lifted and maybe by not that much.  Finally, if the ban were lifted this year, the extra oil on the world market in 2009 would be zero.  OK, maybe we’d have a little more oil on the world market by 2020.  But as far as the price of oil today or even three months from now, my guess is that it had no role in this drop in oil prices.  To suggest it had a significant effect on oil prices is the real folly.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Why does this not surprise me &#8211; <a href="http://kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/2008/07/bush-says-drill-drill-drill-and-oil.html">Lawrence Kudlow</a> is predicting even larger oil price declines:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, at a news conference, Bush repeated his new position, and slammed the Democratic Congress for not removing the congressional moratorium on the Outer Continental Shelf and elsewhere. Crude-oil futures for August delivery plunged $9.26, or 6.3 percent, almost immediately as Bush was speaking, bringing the barrel price down to $136 &#8230; if Congress moves to seal the deal, oil prices will probably keep on falling. That’s the way traders work. They discount the future. Psychology and expectations can turn on a dime.</p></blockquote>
<p>Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc from the same fellow that predicted that the invasion of Iraq would lead to oil prices being $12 a barrel!</p>

<p>It has been a while since I used the EIA’s <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">Gasoline Component History</a> such as the two graphs in this post.  The first graph shows the inflation adjusted price of a gallon of gasoline and how much of that is comprised of the cost of oil.  My inflation adjustment is based on the consumer price index with the base period being early 2006 (BLS uses the early 1980’s as their base period but since prices doubled over this period, I simply divide their deflator by two).  The recent surge in gasoline prices appears to be entirely driven by the surge in the cost of oil.</p>
<p>I was motivated to redo my charts after I posted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/did-jonah-goldberg-learn-about.html">this</a> in reference to the belief of <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTM3YmE3NjYzMzk3ZDZiZWUxZDgyZWE5NDE0NjI1MTg=">Jonah Goldberg</a> that higher gasoline prices can be attributed to rising taxes and higher refinery margins.  But these beliefs do seem to be quite stupid when one checks the data to find that the refinery margin has fallen to only 35 cents per gallon and taxes have fallen to only 37 cents a gallon.  I offer this post to Jonah and others in the hope that they actually check the facts before launching into some future ill-informed rant.</p>

                                <p>When we moved to our &#8220;new&#8221; house, which is located in car-based suburbia à la 1930 about a mile from the end of the nearest — now vanished — streetcar line, I figured proximity to the University of Wisconsin campus (1-1/2 miles) and my office (3 miles) wouldn&#8217;t hurt us, given that we had to pay a near-peak price for the house.  Hedge or speculation?  Both.  (See also <a href="http://coldspringshops.blogspot.com/2008_07_01_archive.html#1484224115482659517">Stephen Karlson</a>&#8216;s rollicking read for the Pigou Club.)</p>
<p>I started commuting to work by bike in the fall of 2005, just in time to see the Katrina gas price spike; now my human-powered local travel project has reached the point where my bike is accumulating miles faster than my car.  So I&#8217;ve figured that I just don&#8217;t drive enough to recover the hybrid price premium. (*)</p>
<p>Of course, that&#8217;s assuming $4-ish gas.  One of the oil supply mysteries is what the Saudis really can do, and BW got hold of some documents that suggest it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/content/jul2008/db2008079_865368.htm?chan=rss_topStories_ssi_5">not that much more than they&#8217;re doing now</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[T]the detailed document, obtained from a person with access to Saudi oil officials, suggests that Saudi Aramco will be limited to sustained production of just 12 million barrels a day in 2010, and will be able to maintain that volume only for short, temporary periods such as emergencies. Then it will scale back to a sustainable production level of about 10.4 million barrels a day, according to the data. BusinessWeek obtained a field-by-field breakdown of estimated Saudi oil production from 2009 through 2013.</p></blockquote>
<p>H/T <a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/?p=10855">Balloon Juice</a> and others.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t exactly a shock, but still, wheeeeee!  The market&#8217;s late reaction to the Saudis seems to reflect this sort of assessment of their excess capacity, but if BW&#8217;s source is right, sign me on with the rest of the blogiverse in not expecting big longer-term price declines.</p>
<p>(*) If you drive a more typical American amount, which is to say a lot, hybrids will usually pay for themselves well within their batteries&#8217; lifetimes, say 3-5 years depending on how you account for the hybrid premium.  The exceptions from the current market are the GM mild hybrids (recently discussed a bit in the comments), which have most of the cost of more economical hybrids without much fuel economy improvement over the comparable four-cylinder models.  I wonder if someone looked at cup holders in German cars and decided to do those hybrids in the worst possible way to learn those hippy tree-hugger suckers.</p>

                                <p>reader mcwop sends this book review for us to read:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://undress4success.com/research/">We looked at this issue</a> as part of a background study in support of a book we&#8217;re working on titled <em>Undress For Success: The Naked Truth About Working From Home</em> to be published by John Wiley &#038; Sons.</p>
<p>The top part of the results form shows the financial, pertroleum and CO2 savings produced by people who already work at home. The bottom part shows the additional savings that could be realized if those who could work at home, did.</p>
<p>Workforce Assumptions <br />Size of workforce and existing work at home workforce numbers comes from the U.S. Census Bureau &#8211; Means of Transportation To Work (B08301) 2006 American Community Survey.</p>
<p>The data on means of transportation to work were derived from answers to Question 25, which was asked of people who indicated in Question 23 that they worked at some time during the reference week. Means of transportation to work refers to the principal mode of travel or type of conveyance that the worker usually used to get from home to work during the reference week.</p>
<p>People who used different means of transportation on different days of the week were asked to specify the one they used most often, that is, the greatest number of days.</p>
<p>• Percent Who Could Work At Home = 40%<br />CEA Energy &#038; Greenhouse Gas Emissions Impact â€“ page 47. Matthews and Williams (2005) estimate that information workers that could have the potential to telecommute represent 40% of the U.S. workforce. Excludes those who already do, regardless of how often the work from home.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>• Roundtrip Minutes to Work = 52<br />Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Omnibus Household Survey &#8211; Average commute is 15 miles each way (26 minutes)</p>
<p>• Number of days/week each worker telecommutes = 5</p>
<p>• Number of workweeks/yr = 48<br />Excludes 2 weeks vacation, 5 paid holidays, and 5 sick days.</p>
<p>Per Person Assumptions <br />• Commuting miles saved / per person = 30<br />Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) Omnibus Household Survey. Average commute is 15 miles each way (26 minutes) &#8211; Avg. miles not avail by region</p>
<p>• Per Person Savings in Days = (5 days a week, times 48 weeks per year, times 52 minutes) divided by 60 minutes, divided by an 8 hour work day. Essentially this is additional free time the telecommuter realizes each year.</p>
<p>• Percent of reduced travel from telecommuting = 65%<br />2005 Reason Foundation — The Quiet Success: Telecommuting&#8217;s Impact on Transportation and Beyond. Page 3. Telecommuters reduce their daily trips by 53 to 77% on telecommuting days. We&#8217;ve used 65% in our calculation but many telework researchers argue the number is closer to 90% because the side stops they would have made on the way to or from work are eliminated or are handled together in a more efficient fashion.</p>
<p>• MPG = 20.3<br />EPA MOBILE6.2 2003 (EPA&#8217; computer model) weighted average of 23.9 mpg for cars and 17.4 mpg for light trucks. Your mileage, as they say, may vary.</p>
<p>• $ Saved per person / yr assuming $3.50/gallon</p>
<p>Aggregate Numbers <br />• Gallons saved/year<br />Gallons per person savings times the number of teleworkers</p>
<p>• $ Saved<br />$ Saved per person time the number of workers</p>
<p>• Barrels Saved:<br />Gallons of gas per barrel of crude = 0.466667<br />42 gallons (1 barrel) of crude equals 19.6 gallons of gas.<br />? Energy Information Administration, Petroleum Supply Annual 2005, June 2006.<br />Greenhouse Gas Savings (aggregate/yr) </p>
<p>• CO2 savings in pounds = 19.4<br />A gallon of gasoline is assumed to produce 8.8 kilograms (or 19.4 pounds) of CO2. This number is calculated from values in the Code of Federal Regulations at 40 CFR 600.113-78, which EPA uses to calculate the fuel economy of vehicles, and relies on assumptions consistent with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) guidelines.</p>
<p>• CO2 savings in metric tons (converted) = 0.00045359<br />Conversion to metric tons: pounds to metric tons = .00045359237</p></blockquote>

In other articles he is very hard on the stupidity of Democratic campaigns and culture war tactics&#8230;which so far has been won by this current group of Republicans.</p>
<blockquote><p>One fact about government outsourcing is settled: It sure doesn&#8217;t save money. A Washington Post reporter who scrutinized Katrina reconstruction contracts in 2006 found that &#8220;the difference between the job&#8217;s actual price and the fee charged to taxpayers ranged from 40 percent to as high as 1,700 percent.&#8221; To cover damaged roofs with tarps, certain contractors billed the government $1.50 per square foot of roof covered; some of the people who actually did the work got under 10 cents per square foot. Guess who kept the difference.</p>
<p>Privatization also constitutes a fundamental change in the constituency to which government answers. Journalist Tim Weiner estimates that, by 2006, about half of the people working for the CIA in Iraq and the National Counterterrorism Center were contractors, former CIA personnel accountable not to the American public but to their employers. &#8220;The spectacle of jumping ship in the middle of a war to make a killing was unremarkable in twenty-first century Washington,&#8221; he writes in his book, &#8220;Legacy of Ashes.&#8221; Among the CIA&#8217;s new hires, he reported, the saying is, &#8220;Get in, get out, get paid.&#8221;</p>
<p>The days when conservatives railed against red tape and shrieked for efficiency in Washington now seem like a lifetime ago. When they finally got the opportunity to put their theory into practice, conservatives contrived instead one of the most wasteful systems ever seen.</p>
<p>It is time for a new Grace Commission, this one examining the sordid history of privatization in all its details. President Barack Obama should launch it on day one.</p>

                                <p>After several lines of sheer babbling <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTM3YmE3NjYzMzk3ZDZiZWUxZDgyZWE5NDE0NjI1MTg=">Jonah</a> treats us with this really funny line:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich — who actually knows how markets work and is better at explaining them than any other politician today</p></blockquote>
<p>No, I think Jonah really believes that Gingrich is a serious economic scholar, which likely explains this babbling:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. government has barred billions of barrels of oil from coming to the market by declaring huge petroleum reserves off-limits to drilling. Uncle Sam stores vast amounts in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, in a petro-lockbox for a rainy day now called “election season.” Government — at the federal and state levels — drives up pump prices with gas taxes and regulations against increasing refinery capacity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind that the EIA has already analyzed the effect on oil prices from allowing more offshore drilling and that it will have no current effect and a very small effect in the future.  The idea that the existence of taxes causes prices to rise is sheer insanity especially given the fact that the relative price of these taxes has eroded over time.  <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">This source</a> shows that the share of taxes in the price of gasoline has fallen to only 10.6% as of May 2008.  Also note that the share of the price gasoline that goes to the refinery margin was only 10% so Jonah&#8217;s line about regulations against increasing refinery capacity is not exactly on-point as far as the current price of gasoline.  No &#8211; it is the price of oil not what the refineries are getting that is driving today&#8217;s prices.  </p>
<p>Maybe we should turn the microphone over to a real economist &#8211; <a href="http://content.ksg.harvard.edu/blog/jeff_frankels_weblog/2008/07/15/offshoring-is-a-more-dubious-policy-when-the-question-is-oil-drilling">Jeff Frankel</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Once the long-term goal of “energy security” policy is properly seen to be amelioration of the economic effects of such a disaster, the Republican policy of “drain America first” is seen to be precisely the wrong response.  We don’t want to maximize current domestic production.  Rather we want to leave the oil underground (or underwater) for decades, until we really need it, until we are so desperate that the economic benefits really do outweigh the costs.  (The costs are chiefly environmental, of course.  But the Republicans have often been keen on giving oil companies access to nationally owned reserves at prices that are even below market costs.   Same as hard-rock mining for mining companies, subsidized water for farmers, and grazing rights on federal lands for ranchers.  But the hypocrisy of the self-reliance rhetoric in Western states — “get Washington off our backs” –  is another story.)  Thus the Democrats have it precisely backwards.   The problem with Republican proposals to re-open domestic oil drilling is not that we desperately need the oil right now, whereas new oil discoveries would not come on line for 5 years or more.   Rather it is that we might truly desperately need the oil in 20 or 30 years, and so don’t want to use it up over the next decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update: At Movie Guy’s insistent request, let me cite <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/crude-tumbles-further-surprise-inventories/story.aspx?guid=%7BABE270BA-1E5C-4300-A641-FCD451DFEFF3%7D&#038;dist=msr_1">this story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) &#8212; Crude-oil futures fell over $4 a barrel Wednesday, leaving crude with its biggest two-day drop in 17 years, after government data showed a surprise increase in U.S. petroleum inventories. U.S. crude inventories rose 3 million barrels to stand at 296.9 million barrels in the week ended July 11, the Energy Information Administration reported. Analysts surveyed by energy-information provider Platts were expecting a drop of 3 million barrels. &#8220;If there is anything that should keep the bulls in the corral while the bears feed in the berry patch, this EIA report is it,&#8221; said James Williams, an economist at energy research firm WTRG Economics &#8230; The unexpected gains in last week&#8217;s U.S. inventories &#8220;could indicate that the idea of real global demand destruction is finally beginning to take hold in the marketplace,&#8221; said Robert Arber, an analyst at financial information provider Stockhouse.com. EIA&#8217;s latest report showed fuel demand is falling. Over the last four weeks, U.S. motor gasoline demand has averaged 9.3 million barrels per day, down by 2.1% from the same period last year, the EIA said.</p></blockquote>
<p>For some reason, MovieGuy felt justified to write the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>If it is the case (and I don&#8217;t know how you would know any facts on this point) that announcements of future intentions will have no bearing on crude oil futures, why did the futures drop after the President&#8217;s announcement and Ben Bernanke&#8217;s testimony this week? You can&#8217;t have it both ways. Either bite the bullet on your position or perhaps back off if you think that you&#8217;re on questionable ground.</p></blockquote>
<p>So let’s see: (a) I don’t know “any facts” on this issue; (b) the only reason for the fall in future prices is Bush’s call for offshore drilling; and (c) anything I or EIA has said to the contrary is simply wrong.  This according to MovieGuy.  Funny – the MarketWatch explanation did not support this contention at all!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/07/mccain_camps_new_attack_obama.php">Erik Kleefleld</a> listens to a Team McCain conference call so we don’t have to:</p>
<blockquote><p>The McCain campaign is taking their effort to distance their candidate from the unpopular President Bush to a whole new level: McCain&#8217;s advisers are now openly attacking Bush on Iraq &#8212; and not only that, they&#8217;re also saying that Barack Obama is the one who is like Bush on the war!  On a conference call just now with reporters, McCain foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann compared Barack Obama&#8217;s insistence on a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq to Bush&#8217;s insistence that we were winning even as things went badly for years.  &#8220;I think the American people have had enough of inflexibility and stubbornness in national security policy,&#8221; Scheunemann said. When asked later by the Huffington Post&#8217;s Sam Stein whether the campaign was disparaging President Bush, Scheunemann dug in: &#8220;We cannot afford to replace one administration that refused for too long to acknowledge failure in Iraq with a candidate that refuses to acknowledge success in Iraq.&#8221;  Forget &#8220;McSame.&#8221; The candidate who would really continue Bush&#8217;s policies is &#8220;BushBama.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are not familiar with Randy Scheunemann, <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/204324.php">David Kurtz</a> explains:</p>
<blockquote><p>This takes some real cojones. A short time ago on a conference call with reporters, Randy Scheunemann, McCain&#8217;s top foreign policy adviser, declared that Obama brings the same failed approach to Iraq as President Bush … Scheunemann was, of course, a significant proponent of the Iraq invasion and as Josh noted the other day worked closely with Ahmad Chalabi and the other usual suspects in pushing the U.S. toward war with Iraq.</p></blockquote>
<p>Has John McCain surrounded himself with advisors that make President Bush’s crew look smart by comparison – or what?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2008/07/15/a-majority-consider-afghanistan-a-failure.aspx">Michelle Cottle</a> is royally brassed off but manages to capture my frustrations with these neocon nitwits perfectly:</p>
<blockquote><p>But here&#8217;s the figure that really caught my eye and the one which the Bush administration should find most shameful&#8211;if indeed it had the capacity for shame. At this point, only 51% of Americans believe the war in Afghanistan to have been worth fighting. This despite the fact that that wretched, utterly dysfunctional country was home base for the Taliban, al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. The bulk of the 9-11 butchers may have originally hailed from Saudi Arabia, but they took their orders and inspiration from the utterly reprehensible fundamentalist nutters running amok in Afghanistan. Alas, the Bush adminstration has done such a sad, scatter-shot job with its War on Terror that most people don&#8217;t know what to think about our little Afghan adventure now. Fifty-one percent of Americans also say the military action there has been unsuccessful&#8211;a view surely fed by the fact that the Taliban has regrouped in the tribal areas of Pakistan and is conducting a nasty guerilla war against the current Afghan government. By allowing itself to become distracted from Afghanistan&#8211;not to mention babbling on dishonestly and confusingly about the nonexistent connections between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda&#8211;the Bushies have managed to convince much of America that we never should have bothered in the first place. This is outrageous. Afghanistan should have sent a loud, definitive signal to hostile regimes worldwide about the power and commitment of American power. Instead, barely half of this country thinks we&#8217;ve done a decent enough job to justify the entire endeavor.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Even before Barack Obama says a word upon his arrival in Israel next week, close observers of America&#8217;s role in the region will get a message from the presence in his delegation of a tall, slightly disheveled diplomat well known to the power players of the Middle East. In a region where simple words and gestures can be taken as weighty indicators of intent, Arabs and Israelis alike will see much meaning in the return of Dennis Ross.  In one way, the message is simple: Ross, a career foreign service officer, was lead negotiator on Israeli-Palestinian issues for Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and he got the two sides as close as they&#8217;ve come to a peace deal before stepping down after the 2000 election. His presence alongside Obama in Israel, the Palestinian territories and Jordan is designed to signal the senator&#8217;s intent to resume the active pursuit of the peace process, which Obama claims President George W. Bush has derailed through inaction.</p></blockquote>
<p>This story links to a profile of <a href="http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1637309,00.html">Dennis Ross</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Few people in the world are as practiced in the diplomatic arts as Dennis Ross. After all, he served as a distinguished Middle East envoy for Presidents George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton. But in his new book, Statecraft: and How to Restore America&#8217;s Standing in the World, Ross pulls no punches when assessing the actions of the current Administration: &#8220;After nearly four years of warfare, Iraq has been a disaster, costing thousands of lives, requiring the expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars, stretching our forces and reserve system to the breaking point, and becoming a magnet for terrorists and hostility toward the United States throughout the Muslim world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Senator Hagel – a grownup member of the Republican Party – will join Senator Obama during the trip to Iraq.  In my view, the more GOP grownups that President Obama asks to assist in the setting and implementation of his foreign policy, the better.</p>
