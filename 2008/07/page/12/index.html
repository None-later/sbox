<p>Here we are again, just into a Bear (sterns) market and we have to face the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are waaaaay to big to fail. A strong case can be made that a bailout will cost relatively little and failure to come to their assistance will cost a lot <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/07/every-time-i-tr.html">even when distracted by Gover Norquist&#8217;s absurd arguments. </a>Here is <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_4670000/newsid_4679900/4679986.stm?bw=nb&#038;mp=wm&#038;news=1&#038;bbcws=1">the video</a>. In defence of the BBC, the accents have gotten a lot better since 1945, no striped trousers on the broadcast at all.</p>
<p>OK so we have to bail out the FM&#8217;s. However, it is irritating that the people who made this mess obtained tens of millions in compensation doing so. I can translate my populist rage into gametheoryspeak noting that bailouts create moral hazard problems. The US government can&#8217;t let Fannie or Freddie or even the medium size bad Bear fail. It shouldn&#8217;t make executives decide to run risks only because they know that if they roll snake eyes, the treasury or the fed will bail them out. So What is to Be Done ?</p>
<p>It seems simple to me (and many many others). The institutions are too big to fail, their officers are vulnerable to bad incentives. The correct policy is to keep the institution from failing in a way which will serve as a lesson to the officers of other institutions.</p>
<p>I think the optimal policy is simple. The chairman of the Fed tells the CEO of To Big to Fail Bank (tbtf bank) that the FED will pick up dodgy assets with face value X if mr CEO picks up dodgy assets with face value equal to 90% of his wealth as reported in the Forbes 500 or 5 years of his (or her hah?) total compensation. Then Bernanke can mention that he is not a shareholder of tbtf bank, but, if the CEO were to say no and the bank were to go bust and he were a shareholder he sure would sue (and presumably win).</p>
<p>Now the CEO can appeal to the 13th amendment and resign on the spot, but he loses if he says yes and loses more if he says no. If he says he is resigning, BB (Ben Bernanke not Big Brother) says his successor will be offered the same deal with the added proviso that CEO I not be paid anything by tbtf bank beyond what CEO I can claim is due to him in court. And so on. BB will get down to someone so poor that he is willing to put 4 years of compensation at risk in order to be CEO.</p>
<p>Unlike the highly compensated officers, that person might even be competent to manage a bank (stranger things have happened).</p>

<blockquote><p>A top economic surrogate for Republican presidential candidate John McCain doesn&#8217;t think people are paying much attention to what people like her have to say.  In discussing McCain economic adviser Phil Gramm&#8217;s remarks about the U.S. becoming a &#8220;nation of whiners&#8221; and suffering a &#8220;mental recession,&#8221; former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina was dismissive of the source.  &#8220;Outside of Washington, where this is an interesting parlor game, I think most Americans are not really focused on what a bunch of surrogates are saying,&#8221; Fiorina said on &#8220;Meet the Press&#8221; on NBC. &#8220;They&#8217;re focused on what the candidates are saying.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, John McCain is talking out of both sides of his mouth on most economic policy issues.  Well maybe he did a stand on Social Security when he called the program a disgrace.  But I do think we can get a clue as the economic policies of any potential new Administration by looking at who his economic advisors are during the campaign. Which is why it is a smart move to distance oneself from Phil Gramm as much as possible.  But how in the world is Carly Fiorina in the least bit qualified as an economic advisor?  Her degree is an MBA from the University of Maryland and the peak of her career was to be the CEO of Hewlett-Packard – a position she left lost on February 9, 2005.  What has she done since then?  Oh yea – she gets to comment on business matter over at the Fox Business Network.  Not exactly a stellar resume for an economic advisor but she would have fit in well in the Bush43 White House.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I suspect few people know that the original Social Security Act set up not one but two retirement systems. Title 2 set up what we recognize as Social Security today, a worker funded retirement based on an insurance model. Title 1 set up something quite different. The history can be found on the SSA.gov website under <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/history/briefhistory3.html">Historical Background and Development of Social Security</a>.<br />
<blockquote>Following the outbreak of the Great Depression, poverty among the elderly grew dramatically. The best estimates are that in 1934 over half of the elderly in America lacked sufficient income to be self-supporting. Despite this, state welfare pensions for the elderly were practically non-existent before 1930. A spurt of pension legislation was passed in the years immediately prior to passage of the Social Security Act, so that 30 states had some form of old-age pension program by 1935. However, these programs were generally inadequate and ineffective. Only about 3% of the elderly were actually receiving benefits under these states plans, and the average benefit amount was about 65 cents a day.</p>
<p>There were many reasons for the low participation in state-run pension systems. Many elderly were reluctant to &#8220;go on welfare.&#8221; Restrictive eligibility criteria kept many poor seniors from qualifying. Some jurisdictions, while having state programs on the books, failed to actually implement them. Many of the state-passed pension laws provided for counties within the state to opt to participate in the pension program. As a result, in 1929 of the six states with operating pension laws on the books only 53 of the 264 counties eligible to adopt a pension plan actually did so. After 1929, the States began enacting laws without county options. By 1932 seventeen states had old age pension laws, although none were in the south, and 87% of the money available under these laws were expended in only three states (California, Massachusetts and New York).</p></blockquote>
<p> So our starting point is a hodge podge of underfunded and largely ineffective state old age plans. Title 1 established General Fund &#8216;Grants to States for Old-Age Assistance&#8217; or in other words a federal welfare system. Title 2 or Social Security as we know it was designed (and did) to phase out Title 1, but really didn&#8217;t start to do so until after 1950.<br />
<blockquote>The significance of the new social insurance program was that it sought to address the long-range problem of economic security for the aged through a contributory system in which the workers themselves contributed to their own future retirement benefit by making regular payments into a joint fund. It was thus distinct from the welfare benefits provided under Title I of the Act and from the various state &#8220;old-age pensions.&#8221; As President Roosevelt conceived of the Act, Title I was to be a temporary &#8220;relief&#8221; program that would eventually disappear as more people were able to obtain retirement income through the contributory system. </p></blockquote>
<p>. The key word is &#8220;eventually&#8221;, monthly benefits under Title 2 would not start until 1942 and for years would be swamped by benefits under Title 1.<br />
<blockquote>Because the program was still in its infancy, and because it was financed by low levels of payroll taxation, the absolute value of Social Security&#8217;s retirement benefits were very low. In fact, until 1951, the average value of the welfare benefits received under the old-age assistance provisions of the Act were higher than the retirement benefits received under Social Security. And there were more elderly Americans receiving old-age assistance than were receiving Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>. Okay what does all this have to do with covered worker ratio? Follow me below the fold.</p>
<p>(Reader Paul schooled me on the numbers. The overall point is sound but some of the arithmetic was off. So while I am busy fixing up the post please see Paul&#8217;s numbers in comments.)<br />It is common to hear people making claims that the ratio of workers to retirees went from an initial 16 to 1 at program inception down to 3 to 1 today enroute to 2 to 1 &#8216;soon&#8217;. Which sounds scary until you realize that no one was even eligible for benefits until 1942, the ratio before that point being literally infinite. Moreover all Americans were paying taxes to support Title 1, if we examined this from the standpoint of taxpayer to federally funded retiree you would end up with a much smaller initial ratio. Moreover the net effect of the phase in of Title 2 and the phaseout of Title 1 was to give all taxpayers an effective tax break with wage workers ultimately shouldering the entire burden for their own retirement. Not that people who earn their income from returns on capital showed much appreciation.</p>
<p>So much of that 16 to 1 transition to 3 to 1 was the result of a transformation from two programs with two sets of beneficiaries, one funded by all taxpayers and the other funded only by wage workers. That is we are not really talking fundamental demographic trends but instead designed policy outcomes. But the distortion doesn&#8217;t stop there.</p>
<p>If we examine <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/II_project.html#105643">Figure II.D3.—Number of Covered Workers Per OASDI Beneficiary</a> we do see a reduction in the ratio from the 3.2-3.4 level typical since 1974 to about 2.2% in 2030, Boomer demographics are in fact real. But this ignores a couple of points. First of all the ratio is not as often stated worker to retiree, with the implication that the idle old are parasitic on the working young, instead it is worker to BENEFICIARY which includes minor children of deceased workers, those childrens mothers, disabled workers, and surviving spouses of one income households. That is not all of this is about paying for greens fees for geezers in Phoenix. In fact in 2007 the total amount of Social Security paid to people other than the retired worker was just over <s>50%</s> 34%. <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/III_cyoper.html#129884">Table III.A5.—Distribution of Benefit Payments by Type of Beneficiary or Payment, Calendar Years 2006 and 2007 [Amounts in millions]</a>. If Social Security did not exist much of this burden would fall back on the overall taxpayer. (Or I suppose we could simply have orphans and paraplegics begging in the streets instead.)<br />{Reader Paul astutely notes that I am not including Aged Widows and Widowers with Retired Workers in figuring out how much of this is really going to seniors. Well in my thinking these people would fall in the category of people society would need to cover anyway. But it is a fair point and would drop that 34% down to 21%}</p>
<p>Which brings us to the second point. A lot of the narrative about Social Security is deliberately shaped around the intergenerational unfairness narrative with Boomers placed in the position of villain while our hero is played by long suffering young Gen-X worker/father. First that ignores the fact that under current projections most of Boomer retirement is in fact funded but second ignores the fact that it only describes a part of the actual demographics. To look at the bigger picture we would need to examine the numbers in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/V_demographic.html#167717">Table V.A2.—Social Security Area Population as of July 1 and Dependency Ratios, Calendar Years 1950-2085</a>. If we do we see that the actual ratio of people 20-64, i.e. mostly workers, to people over 65, i.e. mostly retirees in 2007 was in fact .207 or 5 to 1 rather than the loosely cited 3 to 1. While this ratio does increase due to Boomer demographic realities it only goes to .357 by 2035, a point at which Gen-X themselves will be entering retirement. This isn&#8217;t to understate the realities, going from 5 to 1 working age to retirement age to 2.8 to 1 does require some adjustment. On the other hand if we shift focus and look at total dependency ratio, which includes children, and then examine it in historical perspective things look quite a bit different.</p>
<p>In 1965 total dependency ratio was at .905. In 2007 total dependency ratio is at .667. in 2030 it will be back up to .806. And the reason for the change is pretty obvious, all Boomers were children in 1965, all Boomers are working age in 2007, all Boomers will be retirement age in 2030. But if America didn&#8217;t break at the expense of feeding, clothing and educating us while we were children, it hardly will do so when it comes to feeding us when we are old.</p>
<p>In the end the old 16:1 worker to retiree going to 3:1 going to 2:1 narrative is an attempt to convince people that demography is running amuck when instead most of that is the result of phasing out one program (Title 1) in favor of another (Title 2), with the rest the result of a combination of a large birth cohort (Boomers) life cycling through followed by assumed increases in lifespans for Gen-X retirees. It is just not as dire as the scaremongers would have you want to think.</p>

                                <p>The following is a point of information for healthcare statistics.</p>
<p>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/about_meps/survey_back.jsp">The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which began in 1996</a>, is a set of large-scale surveys of families and individuals, their medical providers (doctors, hospitals, pharmacies, etc.), and employers across the United States. MEPS collects data on the specific health services that Americans use, how frequently they use them, the cost of these services, and how they are paid for, as well as data on the cost, scope, and breadth of health insurance held by and available to U.S. workers.</p>
<p>Major MEPS Components</p>
<p>MEPS currently has two major components: the Household Component and the Insurance Component. The Household Component provides data from individual households and their members, which is supplemented by data from their medical providers. The Insurance Component is a separate survey of employers that provides data on employer-based health insurance.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Household Component</p>
<p>The Household Component (HC) collects data from a sample of families and individuals in selected communities across the United States, drawn from a nationally representative subsample of households that participated in the prior year&#8217;s National Health Interview Survey (conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics). </p>
<p>During the household interviews, MEPS collects detailed information for each person in the household on the following: demographic characteristics, health conditions, health status, use of medical services, charges and source of payments, access to care, satisfaction with care, health insurance coverage, income, and employment. </p>
<p>The panel design of the survey, which features several rounds of interviewing covering two full calendar years, makes it possible to determine how changes in respondents&#8217; health status, income, employment, eligibility for public and private insurance coverage, use of services, and payment for care are related. </p>
<p>The HC expenditures have been projected to future years by selected demographic characteristics by source of payment and type of service.</p>
<p>HC data are available on the MEPS Web site in data tables, downloadable data files (person, job, event, or condition level), projected expenditures through 2008, and interactive data tools, as well as in publications using HC data.</p>
<p>Insurance Component</p>
<p>The Insurance Component (IC) collects data from a sample of private and public sector employers on the health insurance plans they offer their employees. The survey is also known as the Health Insurance Cost Study. </p>
<p>The collected data include the number and types of private insurance plans offered (if any), premiums, contributions by employers and employees, eligibility requirements, benefits associated with these plans, and employer characteristics. </p>
<p>IC estimates are available on the MEPS Web site in tabular form for national, regional, state, and metropolitan areas, as well as in publications using IC data and interactive data tools. IC data files are not available for public release.</p>
<p>Other MEPS Components <br />MEPS also includes a Medical Provider Component (MPC), which covers hospitals, physicians, home health care providers, and pharmacies identified by MEPS-HC respondents. Its purpose is to supplement and/or replace information received from the MEPS-HC respondents. </p>
<p>Data files containing only this supplemental respondent information are not available, but the information is incorporated into the MEPS-HC data files. </p>
<p>In 1996 only, MEPS included a Nursing Home Component (NHC) that gathered information from a sample of nursing homes and residents nationwide on the characteristics of the facilities and services offered; expenditures and sources of payment on an individual resident level; and resident characteristics, including functional limitation, cognitive impairment, age, income, and insurance coverage. The NHC also collected data on the availability and use of community-based care prior to admission to nursing homes. For reasons of confidentiality, NHC data are available only at the Data Center located at AHRQ or one of the Census Bureau&#8217;s Research Data Centers.</p>
<p>The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) provides information on the NCHS National Nursing Home Survey (NNHS), a continuing series of national sample surveys of nursing homes, their residents, and their staff that have been conducted in 1973–74, 1977, 1985, 1995, 1997, and 1999.</p></blockquote>

<p>I had some more or less random thoughts:</p>
<p>1.  If Obama wins the election, in five or six years expect the folks on the right to blame the state of the economy in 2008 on him.  They&#8217;ve had more than enough practice &#8211; how many times have you heard about how the stock market crashed and the Great Depression began on FDR&#8217;s watch, or that he produced dismal growth?  More recently, we&#8217;ve started hearing about the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/john-lott-looks-at-recessions-and.html">Great Recession of the Year 2000</a>, so why would Obama be any different?</p>
<p>2.  If Obama wins the election and raises taxes, expect the economy to do better from 2009 to 2017 than it did from 2001 to 2009.  (And I note &#8211; I don&#8217;t see the signs that Obama will make a good president though of course I hope he proves me wrong, its merely that I don&#8217;t expect him to be this dismal.)  Expect the folks on the right to first predict the opposite, and then, after 2017, to deny the economy improved.  Expect much <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">Sowellizing</a> and possibly new, improved forms of misleading with data.</p>
<p>3.  Speaking of folks on the right, what happened to not changing horses in midstream, the constant rallying cry of 2004?  Iraq still hasn&#8217;t been resolved to anyone&#8217;s satisfaction &#8211; heck, even our puppet wants some sort of timetable to guarantee we&#8217;re going to get out &#8211; the situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating, and the economy has tanked.  So&#8230;  if &#8220;keep doing what we&#8217;re doing&#8221; was promoted as the solution to a relatively small problem (Iraq in 2004), why don&#8217;t they simply announce that the conservative position is to keep doing what we&#8217;re doing on everything now?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/opinion/12sat1.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">This oped</a> does a nice job of calling McCain on his balanced budget BS:</p>
<blockquote><p>the biggest news that Senator John McCain made last week was his renewal of a pledge to balance the federal budget by 2013. How? Who knows? Mr. McCain’s main campaign promises, if fulfilled, would lead to huge budget deficits. Extending the Bush tax cuts, enacting more tax cuts of his own and staying the course in Iraq would cost hundreds of billions of dollars more, every year, than the small bore spending cuts he has specified. Mr. McCain cannot balance the budget on a crusade against pork and a one-year freeze in a sliver of federal spending. Either he has a secret plan to balance the budget or he’s blowing smoke. It is safe to assume there is no secret plan. To balance the budget in the face of ever-increasing tax cuts would require untenable near-term cuts in Medicare, one of the biggest drivers of budget imbalance &#8230; no politician, least of all Mr. McCain, is simply going to slash the life out of the program. Even reform of Social Security, which Mr. McCain has also promised and which also must occur to restore long-term fiscal balance, would not right the budget anytime soon. Any feasible reform (not that Mr. McCain has one) would have to phase in over decades. Which leads us to conclude that Mr. McCain is merely talking the balanced-budget talk. Mr. McCain and his advisers must know that his numbers do not add up. But adding up is not their point. Their point is to perpetuate the fantasy that Americans can have ever bigger tax cuts and a balanced federal budget. They cannot. The unbalanced budgets of the Reagan years and two Bush presidencies are proof.</p></blockquote>
<p>So why is <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=07&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=nyt_calls_for_mccain_to_make_t&#038;4">Dean Baker</a> not pleased with this oped?</p>
<blockquote><p>The one obviously crucial item that is missing from this list is a lower dollar. The United States is running a current account deficit that is equal to 5 percent of GDP. This logically implies means that the public and private sector must together be dissaving (i.e. borrowing) by an amount equal to 5 percent of GDP. While this can be reasonable for a rapidly growing country like China or India, it is not a sustainable position for a rich country with a slow growing labor force like the United States. The only plausible mechanism for adjustment for the current account deficit is a lower value of the dollar. It is understandable that politicians would be reluctant to call for a weak dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>As we noted <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/mccains-energy-policy-and-export-led.html">here</a>, the <a href="http://www.politico.com/static/PPM103_jobsforamericashshs.html">McCain plan</a> calls for a stronger dollar: </p>
<blockquote><p>John McCain&#8217;s policies will increase the value of the dollar and thus reduce the price of oil. In recent years, the declining value of the dollar has added to the cost of imported oil. This will change. Americans will have a stronger economy, a stronger dollar and greater purchasing power for oil, gas and food.</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is this a stupid idea?  Oh yea:</p>
<blockquote><p>Does McCain want net export demand to decline? Does he not understand that the reduction in net export demand from dollar appreciation will deepen the recession and lead to less employment growth?</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Precise, technical terms like knowing the definition of a recession? First-rate analysis of the economics of a gas tax holiday? Honest presentations about deficit reduction plans? Things like that would be nice, but as we saw from the whiner comment &#8211; a very technical and precise term &#8211; I&#8217;m afraid we won&#8217;t get that from McCain&#8217;s team.  You see, it&#8217;s okay to whine about Social Security based upon deceptive presentations of its financial state or to whine about social programs generally, it&#8217;s okay to whine about anything the government does to try to help people having troubles due to the state of the economy, it&#8217;s also okay to whine about the liberal press misleading people, and it&#8217;s okay to whine incessantly if anyone so much as thinks about making taxes more progressive.  But if you have lost your health insurance, had your wages stagnate, your retirement program at work eliminated or scaled back, if you are worried about job security or have been forced to look for a new job as the economy retools for the global age, if you are worried about how gas prices, food costs, and other price increases might impact your budget and have seen the value of your house plunge as those around you get into trouble, if you so much as dare to speak up about any of these or other problems, then you are nothing but a whiner. Buck up, common folks, the rich people in the Republican party are doing just fine, thank you very much, and they really don&#8217;t want to hear whining from the masses.</p></blockquote>
<p>Where have we heard the name Amity Shlaes before &#8211; <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/george-will-blames-fdr-for-continuation.html">oh yea</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>KLo interviews Amity Shlaes and asks her about the books she relied upon when writing her own book on the Great Depression. Not mentioned were Friedman and Schwartz’s A Monetary History of the United States of Charles Kindleberger’s The World in Depression, The General Theory by Lord Keynes, or even Schumpeter’s Business Cycles: A Theoretical, Historical, and Statistical Analysis of the Capitalist Process. No mention of any of the academic publications on this period either. No – her main reference seems to have been FDR’s Folly by Jim Powell. While it may be the perfect book for the wingnuts, I’m not rushing out to purchase it myself.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.amityshlaes.com/bio.php">Her bio</a> includes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Miss Shlaes was formerly a columnist for the Financial Times and, before that a member of the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, specializing in economics. In the early 1990s she served as the Journal&#8217;s features, or &#8220;op ed&#8221; editor. Prior to that she followed the collapse of communism for the Wall Street Journal/Europe. Over the years she has published in the National Review, the New Republic, Foreign Affairs (on the German economy), the American Spectator, the Suddeutsche Zeitung and Die Zeit</p></blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>The National Review and the oped pages of the Wall Street Journal.  Mark should realize that she is not worth losing one’s temper over.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>So&#8230;.how much are you worth? Between 2003 and 2008, the EPA has lowered the value of one human life by $900,000&#8211;making looser environmental regulations a lot less expensive. Of course, devaluation of the dollar makes the comparison between 2003 and 2008 even more dramatic.</p>
<p>In 2003, the value was put at $7.8 million; in 2008, it is $6.9 million. Clearly, the dollar buys less now than it did in 2003. Depending on how you want to measure that fall, you will get the percentage of your choice. However you slice it, the value of one human life decreased by far more than $900,000. That fact, however, has not deterred the Bush economists.</p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25626294/wid/18298287/">MSN</a>,<br />
<blockquote>economists calculate the value based on what people are willing to pay to avoid certain risks, and on how much extra employers pay their workers to take on additional risks. Most of the data is drawn from payroll statistics; some comes from opinion surveys. According to the EPA, people shouldn&#8217;t think of the number as a price tag on a life.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course sweatshop employers want their employees to take enormous risks. And those employees, driven by hunger and need, are willing to risk their lives for small gain. I guess the EPA sees us moving down the scale towards sweatshop philosophy.</p>
<p>And, as far as we lucky ones who do not have to take those risks, we really should applaud looser environmental regulations, i.e., dirtier air, dirtier water. Hey, I am willing to risk a little more mercury to make the economy run. Aren&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Of course, the Bush administration has spent how much on defending the rights of the unborn? Ah, but more people just makes human life cheaper, doesn&#8217;t it? Make sure no sperm is lost. And when the slippery kid slides forth, voila: EPA birth control.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The editors of the WSJ <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/07/every-time-i-tr.html">agree with Brad DeLong</a> that the Fannie/Freddie problem is that their short-term cash flows may be(come) impaired:<br />
<blockquote>The most immediate danger is that investors will shrink from rolling over the debt of the two companies, leading to a run a la Bear Stearns&#8230;.With so much on the line, we&#8217;ve been suggesting that Treasury and Congress step up now with a public capital injection to help [Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac] ride out their losses.</p></blockquote>
<p>So let me see.  The solution to avoiding spending taxpayer monies is&#8230;spending taxpayer monies?  Let&#8217;s see how quickly they backtrack:<br />
<blockquote>Yes, this would mean putting some taxpayer cash up front, but in the cause of avoiding the far greater risk of a collapse or Bear-like run. If the capital injection was made in the form of a subordinated debt or preferred stock offer, taxpayers would get a stake in the companies and some return on their investment once the crisis passes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn&#8217;t this usually what gets done in the &#8220;free market&#8221;?  In fact, iirc, The Big C has done this a few times recently.*  Why should FNMA and FHLMC be different?<br />
<blockquote>We haven&#8217;t suddenly become socialists. What taxpayers need to understand is that Fannie and Freddie already practice socialism, albeit of the dishonest kind. Their profit is privatized but their risk is socialized. We&#8217;re proposing a more honest form of socialism, with the prospect of long-term reform. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>The above paragraph is something I could have written.  And probably have.  And it only gets better:<br />
<blockquote>In return for putting up the cash, the taxpayers would also need some reassurance that this Fan and Fred debacle couldn&#8217;t happen again. Thus their regulator would need the power to shrink their portfolios of mortgage-backed securities that have made them such high-risk monsters, and ultimately to wind the companies down. Apart from outright failure, the worst scenario would be a capital injection that left the companies free to commit the same mayhem all over again two or 10 years from now.</p></blockquote>
<p>You got it, folks.  The WSJ has just come out in favor of (1) a government bailout and (2) more regulation of, effectively, an industry.**</p>
<p>But wait.  Did you catch the shift?  Let&#8217;s try it again:<br />
<blockquote>Thus their regulator would need the power to shrink their portfolios of mortgage-backed securities that have made them such high-risk monsters, and ultimately to wind the companies down.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoop, there it is!  Same old WSJ.  Save the mortgage market just to destroy it. Which must be why, since (see the DeLong link above) Fannie and Freddie are solvent in the long-term, they go on to object to one option:<br />
<blockquote>On Friday, Senate Banking Chairman Christopher Dodd (D., Conn.) declared that Fannie and Freddie are &#8220;fundamentally strong,&#8221; that fears about their capital are overwrought, and that &#8220;this is not a time to be panicking about this. These are viable, strong institutions.&#8221; Yet he also said that one option under discussion is to let the two companies borrow from the Federal Reserve&#8217;s discount window.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s see.  We have a short-term cash flow issue that <em>may</em> arise. Two possible solutions are: (1) ensure that the firms have a borrowing line available that is both <strong>higher</strong> than the FedFunds rate*** and perfectly in keeping with the implicit guarantee of their loans or (2) add some cash now, but with the goal of eliminating the firms, probably just about the time the U.S. housing market starts to recover.</p>
<p>If that second is the case, will their auditors be allowed to say, &#8220;Since you don&#8217;t intend this to be an ongoing concern, we aren&#8217;t going to bother to dig too deeply?&#8221;</p>
<p>The WSJ piece ends with a classic &#8220;disregard what we&#8217;ve said for the past several years, especially the David Malpass and Larry Kudlow editorials&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>If there&#8217;s any other good news in all this, it is that the scandal of Fannie and Freddie is at last coming into public focus. The Washington political class has nurtured and subsidized these financial beasts for decades in return for their campaign cash and lobbying support. Wall Street and the homebuilders also cashed in on the subsidized business, and also paid back Congress in cash and carry.</p>
<p>The losers have been the taxpayers, who will now have to pay the price for this collusion. Maybe the press corps will even start reporting how this vast confidence game could happen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dear Press Corps: please start by examining the WSJ&#8217;s continual &#8220;everything is good because house values keep appreciating&#8221; pieces.</p>
<p>*Yes, I know they have.  Just don&#8217;t have time to find links now.<br />**Since Fannie and Freddie-backed mortgages make up a large majority of the industry; op. cit. <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/06/so-much-for-free-markets-federally.html">here</a>.<br />***I&#8217;ll stop making fun of the &#8220;Discount&#8221; Rate when it goes back to being a Discount Rate.  Possibly, the next President will be sane.</p>
