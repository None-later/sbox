                                <p>T. Boone enters the fray big time. T. Boone Pickens has been talking about Peak Oil for some time. Now he is placing his chips on the table: <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2008/06/08/t-boone-pickens-says-peak-oil-reached-plans-worlds-largest-wind-farm/">A Gigantic Wind Farm</a>, capable of powering over a million homes. The total cost for the oil billionaire: 10 billion dollars. He hopes the Feds will help with the tab. (Boone is worth only $3 billion.) While he expects a 15%-20% profit, I honestly do not think that at eighty years he is interested in the money. (I remember one reporter telling Boone that he was jealous of Boone&#8217;s wealth. Boone shot back: &#8220;I&#8217;d give it all for your youth.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Oil, he says, has peaked at 85 million barrels/year. That great sucking sound you hear is what Boone calls &#8220;the greatest transfer of wealth in history,&#8221; as over 700 billion dollars annually leave the U.S. for foreign producers of oil.</p>
<p>The moment is clearly right for his great move, with oil in $130 range. Furthermore, he is running a series of ads, talking about the entire problem. Maybe the public is ready to listen, instead of hiding its head in the sand.</p>

                                <p>So 300 economists signed a <a href="http://johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/Read.aspx?guid=c90681b9-5dfe-4de4-8057-ceedb30c228d">statement</a> that included:</p>
<blockquote><p>We enthusiastically support John McCain&#8217;s economic plan. It is a comprehensive, pro-growth, reform agenda. The reform focuses on the real economic problems Americans face today and will face in the future. And it builds on the core economic principles that have made America great.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’ve read the plan as has <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/07/first-reactions-to-mccains-jobs-for-america-plan">EconomistMom</a> who asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s now a list of economists who endorse the McCain economic plan up on the Jobs for America website–including at least a couple whom I greatly respect.  I would love for any of them to explain to me how they believe this plan realistically, and wisely, would eliminate the budget deficit in four years, and how any of them who might be less than thrilled with the Bush Administration’s record on fiscal policy can read between the lines (and fluff) of this McCain plan and see anything substantially different.</p></blockquote>
<p>McCain is proposing the standard GOP line that we can cut taxes a lot but not really reduce government spending.  When tried in the 1980’s and with the current Administration, we got the predictable result of lower national savings, which leads to less long-term growth.  Anyone who calls this pro-growth either does not understand economics or has not read the McCain plan very carefully.</p>
<p><a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=06F63EAF-3048-5C12-004605D37EEB185E">Alexander Burns and Avi Zenilman</a> suggest the latter may be the preferred excuse:</p>
<blockquote><p>Upon closer inspection, it seems a good many of those economists don’t actually support the whole of McCain’s economic agenda. And at least one doesn’t even support McCain for president. In interviews with more than a dozen of the signatories, Politico found that, far from embracing McCain’s economic plan, many were unfamiliar with — or downright opposed to — key details. While most of those contacted by Politico had warm feelings about McCain, many did not want to associate themselves too closely with his campaign and its policy prescriptions &#8230; The McCain campaign’s economic team, led by adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin and former eBay CEO Meg Whitman, began collecting signatures from economists several months ago, with the intention of showing support for McCain&#8217;s broad economic priorities, rather than the specific items in his Jobs for America proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Being asked to sign onto an economic plan before one has even had the chance to read it?  Pardon me – but I would never sign something under those conditions.</p>

<p>The answer, of course, was &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Food Shortages are real, dramatically <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:21828803~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html">affecting poor nations</a> from Haiti, across the belt of Africa, through the Middle East, and on up to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Zoellick has asked the U.N. to exempt export restriction (i.e., hoarding) and taxation from the <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/html/extdr/foodprices/index.htm#slide">World Food Program</a> .</p>
<p>While the recent crisis in poor nations may well put over 100 million people into extreme poverty, the poor in all nations are at risk, from Indonesia to the those in the U.S. dependent on the food stamp program.</p>
<p>The causes are real; some are intractable; others, not: the high price of oil, weather, the shift to bio-fuels, and, I would claim, the patterns of trade agreements as globalization favors ever greater efficiency and larger and larger farms. As I noted in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/local-or-global.html">Local or Global</a>, destruction of local food subsidies in poor nations has placed many of these nations at risk.</p>
<p>Zoellick asserts that the problem is man-made; therefore, it can be fixed. I take a more pessimistic view. Some of the problem is man-made; some is not.</p>
<p>High Price of Oil: Oil affects the price of fertilizer, the costs of transportation, and, surprisingly enough, the dependence on large machinery to make cultivation more &#8220;efficient.&#8221; This last is clearly debatable. But I would suggest that redirecting millions away from farms and to the cities may not be as wise as once thought. Clearly, it adds the cost of transportation to the food. Where once these workers were at the source of food production, now they are removed. If demand for oil is approaching available supplies, driving the price higher, then there is no short-term fix for this aspect of the food problem.</p>
<p>Shift to bio-fuels: Using crops and land&#8211;often subsidized&#8211;for the production of bio-fuels only exacerbates food shortages. In short, we need a crash program to develop alternate sources of power, especially clean and renewable sources, solar and wind and water&#8211;now, not some time in the future. Again, some will debate relative costs&#8211;oil vs solar or wind. I would argue that in the long run, we will have little option&#8211;even if results cannot be immediate enough to solve the present problem.</p>
<p>Weather: Think floods, i.e., our Midwest, and droughts&#8211;Africa. As global warming takes hold and extreme weather events become more prominent, then difficulties now will pale before difficulties later.</p>
<p>Meat: In some instances, using land to raise cattle may be inefficient, especially when feed requires crops that people can eat.</p>
<p>Patterns of Globalization: No country should ever surrender its food production to another. Local subsidies for food production should not be abandoned as part of trade agreements. (Think Mexico and NAFTA, as an example.) Nor should any country surrender all or part of its arable land to a large multinational that will seek only the highest price on the world market. (I was amused the other day at an argument over ANWR. Robert Kennedy Jr. pointedly asked an oil exec if ANWR oil would be for the U.S. alone. He could not answer directly.) Nor should any multinational control seed production, forcing farmers to buy its seeds. While globalization is important, how it is done is more important than just pandering to the to interests of powerful players whose only concern is their bottom line. Free markets that following only the path of greed will not work. All must benefit, not just the lucky few.</p>
<p>Collectively&#8211;and I mean all of us, rich and poor&#8211;must think clearly through all the issues.</p>
<p>Zoellick is right when he says the world is entering a danger zone.</p>
<p>Hoarding has already begun, as some countries place restrictions on food exports. Some countries are eyeing the arable land in other countries, hoping to use it as a source of food for their own people. Poor people are on the move everywhere.</p>
<p>Ironically, as we try to deal with this problem immediately, we may well drive up the cost of food, as food is re-directed to those most in need. But that is the price we must pay&#8230;you, I, and everyone else. Too feed those in desperate need, we will have to tighten our own belts.</p>
<p>Of all issues, food is central. If we fight over oil, imagine what we will do over food. Any and all of the successes of globalization (there are many) will vanish in the twinkling of an eye if we do not meet this problem directly and honestly.</p>

                                <p>I encountered the writings of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Klitgaard">Robert Klitgaard</a> twice.</p>
<p>I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tropical-Gangsters-Experience-Development-Decadence/dp/0465087604/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1214379949&#038;sr=8-1">&#8220;Tropical Gangsters&#8221;</a> an excellent book on his experience working for The World Bank in Ecuatorial Guinea which is not to be confused with the epymenus epyminus (oh hell I&#8217;ll never guess the spelling of that word ) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Tropical-Gangsters-Kid-Creole-Coconuts/dp/B0000647HY/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&#038;s=music&#038;qid=1214379949&#038;sr=8-2">CD by King Creole and the Coconuts.</a></p>
<p>Years earlier, when I was a freshman I think, I saw students protesting &#8220;The Klitgaard Report&#8221; to the president of Harvard, in which he noted the fact (it&#8217;s a simple calculation) that African American students at Harvard had a lower GPA* than would be expected conditional on SAT scores. Brad DeLong, who actually read the report, says he detected no sign of racism in it.</p>
<p>Now obviously we all knew that average SAT scores of African Americans are lower than those of Euro-Americans so the SAT was presumably biased against African Americans (I mean if interpreted as a measure of smarts not assimilation in the dominant US cultural tradition). A justification for affirmative action which I personally liked a lot was that a reasonable prediction of performance would be standard measures (like the SAT) corrected for disadvantage. Thus I was most distressed by the Klitgaard report (not enough to go to the protest where Derek Bok talked to angry students as he often did because I mean he just did a simple calculation and the data ambushed him).</p>
<p>Now I understand. First lets assume that the cultural bias in Harvard grading is the same as the cultural bias in the SAT so race has the same effect on the expected value of the Harvard GPA as on the SAT score. Now note that an SAT score is the sum of the expected SAT score for that individual and a disturbance term which is specific to that test that day. The disturbance term includes did the student have a cold that day etc and also, if the student guessed on questions, did the student guess right. Fact is, if someone takes the SAT twice he or she will get different scores.</p>
<p>Given the fact that the distribution of SAT scores of African Americans is lower than that of Whites (first order stochastic dominance) if one has an African American and a White American with the same SAT score, one can rationally (and illegally) infer that the African American probably had a good day that day and the White American a bad day, that is that the expected value of the day specific disturbance is higher for the African American than for the White American.</p>
<p>Already this implies the Klitgaard effect even if the effect of race on expected SAT score and expected GPA is the same. The explanation of the Klitgaard effect is the same as Milton Friedman&#8217;s explanation of the fact that African Americans save more than White Americans with the same income (this is a fact). The same current income implies a lower expected value for permanent income just as the same success at demonstrating acculturation of whatever on a given day corresponds to lower expected level of acculturation to White America.</p>
<p>This is a general issue. There are many many empirical results which I found disturbing in which African Americans have outcomes like White Americans with lower incomes. All of this makes sense of important outcomes depend on permanent non current income. Of course they do. A huge amount of social science research on race and income was rendered obsolete by the permanent income hypothesis decades ago.</p>
<p>Of course that&#8217;s not the half of it. Even without colds and lucky guesses and such, the SAT is correlated with GPA but they are not measuring the same thing (whatever it is and whether or not either has anything to do with one&#8217;s real ability to contribute to the growth of human knowledge and the fullest flowering of humanity which they might because, hell, anything is possible). For example, in the SAT they gave us tiny little passages to read and it was wise to read every word. At Harvard professors don&#8217;t bother to winnow their reading lists so you have to quickly decide what to skip and what to actually read (unless you are Brad DeLong and read 1000 words a minute and never learned that skill and is <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/06/curses-foiled-a.html">suffering from that lack now)</a>. So for the same SAT score, one would guess that the African American student has more ability to read every word and understand compared to his or her ability to decide what to read when he or she doesn&#8217;t have time to read every word.</p>
<p>Ergo** Klitgaard effect.</p>
<p>Now even if the SAT has a particularly strong cultural bias so race has a bigger effect on expected SAT score than on expected GPA, the measurement error statistical discrimination bit can imply Klitgaard&#8217;s result if it outweighs the SAT is biased effect.</p>
<p>OK now sticking with GPA as our end point, I note that even if 11% of people who would get a harvard GPA over 3.9 (Harvard is different 4 is the max) are African American, this won&#8217;t be true of people admitted to Harvard if 11% of admitted students are African American. It&#8217;s that disadvantage and cultural difference and stuff makes the predictors of performance less accurate. Getting a student with an over 3.9 GPA requires that there be such a student and that one detects him or her and that you don&#8217;t have to choose between him or her and the son of a super rich alumnus who will give tons of money if you admit his son but it is neither gross class bias or bribery because Harvard is different and superior and you don&#8217;t understand and an institution struggling to get by with an endowment of only <a href="http://www.hmc.harvard.edu/">I don&#8217;t know how much more than $ 40 billion</a>*** has to make some compromises.</p>
<p>*Harvard called it something else like a &#8220;cube&#8221; because Harvard is superior and so it has a superior measure of grades)</p>
<p>** I never heard a Harvard student use that word except when denouncing &#8220;Ergo&#8221; a really dumb libertarian student magazine published by people who claimed some affiliation to MIT.</p>
<p>*** I note that the person who will <a href="http://www.hmc.harvard.edu/about_hmc/news.php">start managing all that money in one week, Jane Mendillo seems to be neither male nor anglo</a>. Another glass ceiling broken. Now she can decide whether to bail out a firm run into the ground by Jenna Bush like <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines02/1010-08.htm">a predecessor of hers did for Harken energy</a> (high treason since Bush is a Yalie).</p>
<p>update: This post was more than usually incomprehensible. I try to explain in comments and here (same text cut and pasted)</p>
<p>Sorry my post was incomprehensible. The permanent income hypothesis is unusual in economics because it explains facts which seem very odd at first glance. It is not true (has been rejected by the data) but, in this case, the glass is half full (in others it is totally empty).</p>
<p>One fact which it explains is that, when one regresses log consumption on log current income, one gets a coefficient less than one, yet over time, aggregate consumption grows at the same rate as aggregate income. Another is that Blacks consume less compared to Whites than one would predict given their current income.</p>
<p>Both can be explained if consumption depends on income averaged over a long period (as it does according to the PIH) so current income is equal to this average plus a disturbance term.</p>
<p>Now the bit on SATs and GPAs has nothing to do with bias in the SAT. &#8220;Biased&#8221; is a statement about the expected value of a statistic.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say there is something call it ESATGPA which causes high expected SATs and GPAs so SAT score is ESATGPA plus a mean zero disturbance and GPA s a function of ESATGPA plus another uncorrelated mean zero disturbance. Thus the SAT is, by assumption an unbiased measure of something to do with the GPA.</p>
<p>Now consider a group with lower than average ESATGPA. To avoid race, consider people whose first language is not English (hugely correlated with low SAT). Note I am assuming ENFL (English not first language) has the same effect on SAT and GPA so the SAT remains unbiased even if some people didn&#8217;t learn English as babies. However, given the disturbance to SAT, the best estimate of ESATGPA has a positive coefficient on SAT and a negative coefficient on ENFL (this follows mathematically from my assumptions). Thus people with ENFL will have lower expected GPAs than people with the same SAT scores and English as a first language.</p>
<p>Or forget GPA. Let&#8217;s say we are trying to use SAT scores from one day to predict SAT scores on a second sitting of the SAT. The SAT is certainly not a biased measurement of expected score on the SAT. However, Thus people with ENFL will have lower expected new SAT scores than people with the same SAT scores and English as a first language.</p>
<p>I assure the irritated reader that this is simple statistics. It also explains away a huge number of apparently interesting results in social science.</p>

<p>Time to pile on regarding the 300 economists for the McCain economic plan.  I thought it was pretty funny that Douglas Holtz-Eakin signed on &#8212; &#8216;look, boss, I approve of my own plan!&#8217; &#8212; and the presences of the likes of Phil Gramm, Kevin Hassett, and John R. Lott Jr. should be viewed as each constituting minus a large number of good economists, so the net number of signatories is close to zero.</p>
<p>The opportunity for confusion, as even <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/07/08/the-economic-policy-of-john-mccain?rss=true">Felix Salmon exhibits some</a>, is the presence of undeniably prominent economists on the list.  To help in evaluating the significance of there presence, here&#8217;s a prediction from quasi-Nobel laureate Gary Becker (signer of the McCain statement), current CEA chair Edward Lazear, and John Bates Clark medalist Kevin Murphy of the Chicago GSB (Lazear and Murphy did not sign):<br />
<blockquote>The evidence is clear: Cutting taxes will have beneficial effects. Tax cuts will keep government spending in check and will provide the incentives necessary to produce a highly skilled, productive work force that enables high economic growth and rising standards of living.</p></blockquote>
<p>That was from &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB106548881712135300-search.html?collection=wsjie%252F30day&#038;vql_string=becker%253Cin%253E%2528article%252Dbody%2529">The Double Benefits of Tax Cuts</a>,&#8221; published on the W$J op-ed page on October 7, 2003.  Goes to show that the line between being a real economist and a &#8220;policy entrepreneur&#8221; is a fine one. For some indications of how that has worked out, see e.g. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">here</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-fiscal.html">here</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-personal-income.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/comparing-presidents-average-real.html">here</a> from the AB archives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, leave it to the <a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2008/07/in-brief-john-mccain-hateshearts.html">Rude Pundit</a> to get right to the fundamental contradiction of the list (a very extended, and actually non-rude, excerpt is required):<br />
<blockquote>So John McCain proposes a gas tax holiday and economists almost universally say it&#8217;s a stupid idea. In June, McCain, being a reasonable man, chooses to mock the economists: &#8220;If you want to call it a gimmick, fine. You know the economists? They’re the same ones that didn’t predict this housing crisis we’re now in.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Now McCain has put forth a great and mighty economic plan. Did it yesterday, less than a month after dissing the poindexters. And his campaign has released a letter from, well, who else? Economists who support it. Oodles of them. Guess they know a lot about economics, eh?</p>
<p>&#8230;[T]he Rude Pundit chose one of the names at relatively random. University of Chicago&#8217;s Gary Becker, who does a blog on, you know, economics&#8230; [B]ack in December 2007, Becker says, &#8220;The vast majority of economists, including me, were surprised by the extent of the subprime mortgage crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, to conclude: for John McCain, economists who didn&#8217;t predict the mortgage crisis don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about when it comes to a gas tax holiday, but when it comes to his entire economic plan, they&#8217;re a-ok. What fun.</p>
<p>Does that qualify as straight talk?</p></blockquote>

If that were all true, does McCain not understand that his promotion of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/mccains-energy-policy-and-export-led.html">dollar appreciation</a> could lead to lower export demand, which will in his own words be a barrier to our access to foreign markets and:</p>

They were invented in that Great Frozen Socialist Paradise to the north. You read that right: Ugly neon-hued foam shoes are another diabolical innovation for which we can Blame Canada.  The company that invented them was subsequently bought by Hansen and two other aforementioned Colorado entrepreneurs, who added the cute name and the marketing gloss. But the shoes are still made abroad, in the original factory in Quebec, where the employees come pre-equipped with their own health insurance. Or at least, they will be for a few more weeks: in April, the company announced that they will close down the Quebec City plant in July, sending the 670 jobs there to plants in Mexico, Brazil, and beyond.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did someone say NAFTA?  But we are not done:</p>
<blockquote><p>Following a solid IPO in 2006 and a strong 2007, their sales have been off dramatically this year. The company&#8217;s published fundamentals look OK, but sell-through sucks, and their current stock price is down 82 percent from this time last year. In other words: it&#8217;s a Great American Business that&#8217;s showing signs of getting hammered in a Republican recession. Also, there are now at least three shareholder lawsuits in the offing. Evidently, some investors suspect that the owners knew more than they were telling when they dumped large quantities of their own stock late last year, just before it all went to hell. In other words: It&#8217;s a Great American Business that&#8217;s run by Republicans, who are evidently getting everything their generous donations to the GOP paid for: presidential puffery, scrupulously indifferent SEC oversight, low taxes— and a tanking economy that&#8217;s left fewer and fewer families in a position to pay $35 for a pair of kids&#8217; shoes.</p></blockquote>
<p>A “Great American Business”?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: It always helps to check the SEC 10-K filings, which for Croc says in part:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2007, international sales accounted for approximately 48% of total revenues in 2007, compared to 32% in 2006 and 7% in 2005 &#8230; In the year ended December 31, 2007, we manufactured approximately 17% of our footwear products at our Company-operated manufacturing facilities in North America, Italy and Brazil. We obtained the remaining 83% of our footwear products from third-party manufacturers in China, Bosnia, Vietnam, Romania and the U.S. In the year ended December 31, 2007, our largest third-party supplier in China produced approximately 56% of our footwear unit volume.</p></blockquote>
<p>Domestic sales were still over half of total sales but it appears that domestic production was less than half.  So Croc is a net importer of shoes with most of their shoes made in China.  McCain is holding this company up as an example of how we can export more to the rest of the world but in truth, it is more of an example of how we purchase shoes made in places like China.  </p>

<p>The latest report, a continuing subject for GAO, observes that &#8220;A Knowledge Based Funding Approach COULD Improve Weapon System Acquisition Outcomes&#8221;.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08619.pdf">for the whole set of observations</a>.</p>
<p>From an economic, as well as a cost accounting, perspective how could anyone spend anyone else’s money without rudimentary knowledge of WHAT they could get for the MONEY?  What kind of system works without knowledge?  Where does truth come in the knowledge equation?</p>
<p>The gist of the report is that acquisition managers continuously accept less money than they need and accept the responsibility to make things happen.  Then, not being miracle workers; they have to take MUCH longer, get MUCH LESS performance and spend far MORE money than had they been given &#8220;enough&#8221; money to start with.</p>
<p>From my experience it is like the old &#8220;Name That Tune&#8221; game show.  Only in the case of defense acquisitions the acquisition manager, who will be gone before anyone realizes her mistakes, assures everyone the tune can be named in 5 notes, takes the money for the 5 notes and then after she is gone on to an ever more important assignment it is discovered that the tune needed closer to 20 notes to figure out and then a few dozen more notes to get the job done.</p>
<p>GAO notes that budgeting too little money results in more money and time to do the job.  Like weight on airplanes time drives cost as the defense establishment has lots of overhead and is often wrongfully viewed as a national asset which its mere existence, even inept, is worth the taxpayers&#8217; dough.</p>
<p>You can read the report about the need to have more knowledge of what is required and more knowledge of what the industry can do.  Neither of which are coming any time soon.</p>
<p>But not to worry, the F-35 will still be not needed when it is delivered ten years after the first acquisition managers said they could whittle that beak in 5 years for $120B.</p>
<p>All they are doing is whittling beaks…………………….<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />This one by reader ilsm</p>
<p>Rdan here:  ilsm has been using GAO reports as a vehicle to explain his experience in the industry over this series as agreed to with cactus but formed with my moderating.  There has been some concern that his explanations are too biased in particular ways, but I do not know whether this stems from this series or previous postings from last years.</p>
<p>As a confirmed conscientious objector (Navy based childhood and 1-0 exemption), I have no expertise in the matter except to help with damage from operations.  If someone has a counter-factual, send the posts.</p>

<p>I was listening to radio for smart people the other day when they did  <br />a piece about the effect of high gas prices on the price of gas  <br />guzzling cars.</p>
<p>They followed the owner of a very high-end SUV as he drove into the  <br />used car lot and asked how much he could get for his car.  He told  <br />the radio person he just couldn&#8217;t afford the gas, and he was hoping  <br />to get about seventy thousand dollars for the car.  The appraiser  <br />came back with an offer of thirty thousand.  I am sure I heard the  <br />man wince; then he wandered off to think about it.</p>
<p>Here, the learned economist stepped up to the microphone and told the  <br />radio person that the owner of this SUV was about to make an  <br />irrational decision.</p>
<p>Look he said, last year gas was 3 dollars a gallon.  This year it is  <br />four.  So if he uses a thousand gallons a year, the difference is a  <br />thousand dollars.  And to save a thousand dollars he is about to lose  <br />40,000.</p>
<p>Well, I was thinking about the same thing myself, so I can&#8217;t be too  <br />hard on the economist;  but he sounded a little too smug for my  <br />taste, so I wondered.</p>
<p>First, I wondered if that thousand extra dollars for gas next year  <br />was just about a thousand dollars more than the man had to spend.  I  <br />don&#8217;t think economists have ever learned that a dollar is a much  <br />bigger deal to the man who has one less than he needs than it is to  <br />the man who has one more than he needs.</p>
<p>But then I imagined the man thinking:  If I sell the SUV for thirty  <br />thousand and turn around and buy a car for thirty thousand that gets  <br />30 miles to the gallon, instead of the 10 that the SUV gets, then  <br />after ten years I will have a car worth maybe ten thousand dollars,  <br />and I will have spent about 13,000 on gas.  But if I keep the SUV  <br />another ten years, even if I can get 30,000 for it then, I will have  <br />spent 40.000 on gas.  Looks to me like letting go of the SUV will  <br />cost me about 8,000 over ten years, but keeping it will cost me 10,000.</p>
<p>So the question is whether I need to have the 2600 a year between now  <br />and then more than I need the pleasure of owning that expensive car.</p>
<p>So who is right?  The hapless owner, or the learned economist?<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />This one by coberly</p>
