                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The <a href="http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/news/election/s_576734.html">Pittsburgh Tribune-Review</a> interviews a Republican who makes Dick Cheney look honest by comparison:</p>
<blockquote><p>And I am convinced, and by the way we have five Nobel Laureates and 200, 300 economists who think that we have a viable proposal that has to do with job creation, that has to do with keeping taxes low, with health &#8212; affordable and available health care, and to making sure that our economy can recover in a robust fashion. Spending in my view is the major contributor to a lot of the economic difficulties we have today. We have allowed spending to get completely out of control. The size of spending has increased by some 40 percent, the greatest increase in &#8220;discretionary spending.&#8221; The greatest increase in size of government since the Great Society.</p></blockquote>
<p>Increases in nominal spending maybe but the ratio of Federal spending to GDP has not increased nearly as much.  Incidentally, McCain suckered those 300 economists to sign something stupid <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/mccains-300-economists-may-sign-just.html">before</a> his released his plan.  Some of them are now rejecting key elements of the plan and yet McCain says they agree with it?  Incredibly dishonest!</p>
<p>But here’s a whopper I’ve heard from others:</p>
<blockquote><p>We are watching probably the greatest transfer of wealth perhaps in history from the United States of America to the Middle East and other oil producing countries, $(400) or $500 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>No, no, no – trades are not transfers of wealth.  No one is forcing us to purchase this oil.  Of course, McCain doesn’t exactly have a magic wand to induce us to buy less.  But the biggest whoppers came when he was asked about Social Security:</p>
<blockquote><p>One, do a better job than has been done in the past of convincing people that it&#8217;s broken. I think you can do that with one chart that shows how much money is going out and how much is coming in, and when there&#8217;s more going out than coming in and when there&#8217;s no money left.</p></blockquote>
<p>For the past 25 years, Social Security has been running surpluses and we’ll see surpluses for another decade or so.  OK – someday we’ll see negative cash flows which will mean that the circa $8 trillion in reserves will start declining over time.  But McCain is arguing there’ll be no money left.  That’s a lie.  But notice that after he said all proposals are on the table, we got this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Trib: Do you favor raising the cap? <br />McCain: Pardon me? <br />Trib: Do you favor raising the cap? <br />McCain: No, and I think by doing so, as Sen. Obama wants to do, you are obviously putting a very, very big increased tax on &#8230; middle income Americans who filing jointly and in other ways will be paying a very big increase.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess that one’s not on the table.  Odd – people making over $200,000 a year are middle Americans.  But I guess the backdoor employment tax increase inherent in the GOP strategy – cutting Social Security benefits but not cutting payroll taxes, which means that our payroll contributions get diverted to employment taxes – only affects people who aren’t middle Americans.  You know – the peons who make less than a $100,000 a year.  I do declare – John McCain is an elitist (as well as a liar)!</p>

                                <p>So the good news yesterday (h/t <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/07/09/extra-credit-wednesday-edition">Felix</a>) is that, even as <a href="http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=6851">he was voting to eviscerate the Fourth Amendment</a>, Barack Obama <a href="http://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2008/07/obama-amend-ban.html">urged a change to bankruptcy law</a>.  The devil is in <a href="http://news.lp.findlaw.com/ap/a/p/1131/07-08-2008/20080708070505_14.html">the details</a> (the &#8220;median cost&#8221; of a home in NY State won&#8217;t keep anyone living in their house in Westchester or even Rockland County, let alone PGLville), but it&#8217;s a nice start, as Elizabeth Warren notes:<br />
<blockquote>Obama has history.  He voted against the bankruptcy bill.  He voted in favor of the amendments that would have eased the effects of the amendments. But his real history is deeper. He was a community organizer who saw first-hand the effects of aggressive lending.  He was a state legislator who felt the impact of federal pre-emption on his ability to protect the citizens he represented.</p>
<p>&#8230;McCain also has a history.  McCain has voted in favor of financial institutions since he first went to Washington.  He voted over and over for the bankruptcy bill, and he voted against the amendments to give medical bankrupts a means test exemption, against a uniform minimim homestead for older Americans, against limiting recovery for lenders who violate Truth-in-Lending laws.  After Katrina, McCain opposed an amendment to make procedures easier for victims of natual disasters.  The list is long&#8230;.</p>
<p>The deteriorating economy make bankruptcy a more urgent national issues. Bankruptcy and consumer finance are issues where the money and power is all on one side and the middle class families are on the other.  It is also an area where both candidates have an on-the-record history.  Senator Obama has now thrust bankruptcy issue into the national spotlight.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, my immediate reaction was to attempt to go short the possibility that Obsidian Wings-favorite Vice Presidential candidate, Joe Biden (D-BofA [nee MBNA]) would be chosen.*  But I can&#8217;t find the contract on intrade, and the <a href="http://politicalmarket.cnn.com/markets/8097">CNN &#8220;political market&#8221;</a> just notes a drop of &#8220;the field&#8221; and HRC** with most of the support going to John Edwards (and some to Bill Richardson).***</p>
<p>So there probably isn&#8217;t a way to directly profit on the Good News from ObamaNation yesterday, but eliminating Joe Biden from the list of possible VP nominees is certainly a Public Good.</p>
<p>*If that does happen, after yesterday&#8217;s speech, I&#8217;m voting for McCain, since it will then be truly impossible to take anything Obama says seriously.</p>
<p>*Must be her FISA vote.</p>
<p>***The positive interpretation is that something like 5.5% of those in the CNN political market really believed that Biden would or should be the VP nominee.  The negative interpretation would be that around 5.5% of those registered believed that Joe Biden would be a good VP choice in the first place.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NzRkNzVlYWMzNjY2OTExNDRkNmI1YmUxYjFjZGJmZjM=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> who must be philosophically opposed to anything that makes sense including good public policy went giddy at the prospect that McCain had abandoned this proposal:</p>
<blockquote><p>So I picked up the phone and dialed a senior McCain official to make sure these old eyes hadn’t missed it. Sure enough, on deep background, this senior McCain advisor told me I was correct: no cap-and-trade. In other words, this central-planning, regulatory, tax-and-spend disaster, which did not appear in Mac’s two recent speeches, has been eradicated entirely — even from the detailed policy document that hardly anybody will ever read. So then I asked this senior official if the campaign has taken cap-and-trade out behind the barn and shot it dead once and for all — buried it in history’s dustbin of bad ideas. The answer came back that they are interested in jobs right now — jobs for new energy production and jobs from lower taxes. At that point I became satisfied. Even though a McCain presidency might resurrect cap-and-trade, it will be a much different format. More important, the campaign is cognizant of the conservative rebellion against it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_07/014058.php">Kevin Drum</a> is smart enough not to trust anything that Kudlow writes and he recognizes that Kudlow is “crazy” but then Kevin adds: </p>
<blockquote><p>McCain&#8217;s cap-and-trade plan was a watered down muddle to begin with, and it was obvious his heart was never in it. Still, it was an important part of his effort to seem moderate and bipartisan on energy and environmental issues, and a lot of people bought into it. So if Kudlow is right, it means that McCain is playing a pretty cynical game here: publicly taking credit for a &#8220;maverick&#8221; stand against his own party while quietly getting word out to the base that he isn&#8217;t serious about it. Pretty slick, Senator.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://marcambinder.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/07/mccain_sticks_by_capntrade.php">Marc Ambinder</a> must have sources different from Kudlow’s:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jill Hazelbaker, McCain&#8217;s communications director, calls the notion that McCain is abandoning or minimizing his support for cap-n-trade &#8220;totally false.&#8221;  I think I can reconcile the two views: McCain&#8217;s talking about jobs this week, not cap-n-trade. When he talks about energy &#8212; as he did two weeks ago, he talks about cap-n-trade. Kudlow considers cap-n-trade to be a critical (and negative) part of McCain&#8217;s economic policy; McCain considers it part of his energy policy; in campaigns, these type of issues tend to sort themselves into silos, reasonably, and so it ought not surprise anyone that McCain&#8217;s focus on jobs and taxes doesn&#8217;t tilt too far into energy policy precincts.</p></blockquote>
<p>And now <a href="http://kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/2008/07/cap-and-trade-minimizing.html">Kudlow</a> must have gotten the message from the McCain camp to soft pedal the fact that McCain is flip-flopping again:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, as far as abandoning, that’s not what I said. I wrote that a McCain presidency might resurrect cap-and-trade, although it will be a much different format. But the key point is that several campaign advisors told me that the issue now is jobs and the economy, and of course $4 gas at the pump and $140 oil in the world market. Since cap-and-trade would not only establish the biggest government regulatory plan in history, and also would substantially raise gas and other fuel prices, the idea is a loser right now as every opinion-poll survey clearly shows.  Hence, the senator is being smart to move away from cap-and-trade and instead support drill, drill, drill for more energy supplies to reduce gas prices, as well as tax-cut plans to spur economic growth and jobs.  Mr. McCain is also correct to link drill, drill, drill with new energy-related job creation. In my formulation of this, nuclear power and clean coal are part of drill, drill, drill, as are natural gas and even alternative fuels. Last night former-Sen. Phil Gramm, who is ostensibly McCain’s most senior economic advisor, said as much on our program.  So while Ms. Hazelbaker may say that minimizing cap-and-trade support is totally false, she is engaging in a certain degree of cognitive dissonance on this subject. And let me note that the intent of my piece yesterday was to praise Mr. McCain on this topic, not to bury him.</p></blockquote>
<p>Leave it to Lawrence Kudlow to praise a Republican for talking out of both sides of his mouth!</p>

                                <p>In honor of <a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/07/just-saw-no-to-crack.html">this post</a> (from another blog whose political posts I&#8217;ve stopped reading; Hilzoy is in good company*), I have decided today to shave off my beard and mustache.**</p>
<p>After all, David (&#8220;Axis of Evil&#8221;) Frum is always right, as John Holbo <a href="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2003/11/dead_right.html">originally documented</a>:<br />
<blockquote>This sentiment or intuition or feeling (whatever you call it) produces a strangely hypertrophic concern with what seem (to me anyway) like rather ornamental details:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am bearded, and I notice that my boss and the last four men in my section to win promotion are clean-shaven, I will find myself slowly nudged toward the barbershop.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>which led to:<br />
<blockquote>Frum: Just think about it. Our economy depends on a healthy culture.</p>
<p>BG: But you don&#8217;t even care about the economy. You said you don’&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Frum: I wish you hadn&#8217;t mentioned that.</p>
<p>BG: But I did.</p>
<p>Frum: Look, if you shave the beard, everything will be better.</p>
<p>BG: You&#8217;’re a moonbat.</p>
<p>Frum: It’&#8217;s all related to foreign policy and wheelchair access in public school, in ways that would take a long time to explain.</p></blockquote>
<p>*<a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/07/test.html">Exception noted</a>.</p>
<p>**This, of course, has nothing whatsoever to do with a much higher proportion of white hairs being prominently displayed in those two parts of the hair.</p>

                                <p>Back in May, a number of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/fed-frannie-and-freddie.html">people</a> expressed deep concerns over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Their financial cushions were too thin. If they should <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/business/06fannie.html?_r=3&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">fail</a>, then<br />
<blockquote>the mortgage business could lose its only lubricant, potentially causing the housing market to plummet and the credit markets to freeze up completely.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Because of the widespread perception that the government would intervene if either company failed, they can borrow money at lower interest rates than their competitors. As a result, they have earned enormous profits that have enriched shareholders and managers alike: from 1990 to 2000, each company’s stock grew more than 500 percent and top executives were paid tens of millions of dollars.<br />&#8230;In a March meeting, Freddie Mac’s chairman, Richard F. Syron, bolstered those fears by saying the company would put shareholders’ interests first. </p></blockquote>
<p>Amid <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/business/06fannie.html?_r=3&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">rumours</a> that both companies&#8211;owned by investors but created by Congress&#8211;are now close to collapse and with their stocks plummeting, have we reached rock bottom in the mortgage debacle? And at what cost to the taxpayer, now deep in debt, saddled with sky-rocketing oil prices, and facing a world where food prices may be threatening global stability?</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shares were down nearly 50 percent<br />in early trading as investors worried that the companies will<br />suffer larger losses and default on debt.  July 11.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong>  <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/07/conservatorship-for-fannie-or-freddie.html">CR</a> has some thoughts on the subject.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washtimes.com/news/2008/jul/09/mccain-adviser-addresses-mental-recession">Patrice Hill</a> reports that Phil Gramm thinks the economy is doing just great:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve heard of mental depression; this is a mental recession,&#8221; he said, noting that growth has held up at about 1 percent despite all the publicity over losing jobs to India, China, illegal immigration, housing and credit problems and record oil prices. &#8220;We may have a recession; we haven&#8217;t had one yet.&#8221; &#8220;We have sort of become a nation of whiners,&#8221; he said. &#8220;You just hear this constant whining, complaining about a loss of competitiveness, America in decline&#8221; despite a major export boom that is the primary reason that growth continues in the economy, he said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve never been more dominant; we&#8217;ve never had more natural advantages than we have today,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We have benefited greatly&#8221; from the globalization of the economy in the last 30 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Gramm thinks the economic growth rate has been great?  We’ve had one decent annual growth rate since 2000 – that being the 3.6% in 2004 which only partially made up for the slow growth rates from 2001 to 2003 (0.8%, 1.6%, and 2.5%).  Real GDP grew by 3.1% in 2005, 2.9% in 2006, and only 2.2% in 2007.  I guess that’s why the employment to population ratio fell from 64.4% down to 62.0% by September 2003 only to crawl back to 63.4% by December 2006.  The employment to population ratio has since declined 62.4%.  People know that the labor market is currently quite weak but I guess Phil Gramm has not gotten that into his head yet.  </p>
<p>As far as benefiting from globalization – while it is true that export demand growth has been strong for the last few years, real exports fell during each quarter from 2000QIV to 2001QIV and from 2002QIV and 2003QIII.  And during 2007, imports exceeded exports by almost $700 billion.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. McCain would tackle intransigent budget deficits by wrestling down burgeoning benefits programs and aggressively attacking wasteful spending whether it&#8217;s in the Pentagon&#8217;s procurement and weapons budget or congressional pork-barrel bills, he said.  A proven &#8220;instrument&#8221; of bipartisan reform and change in many areas, Mr. McCain would seek out Democratic leaders like Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada to fashion a bipartisan reform of Social Security.  Mr. Gramm said a bipartisan deal might include raising the retirement age to 70 over 30 years, indexing the benefits of wealthier retirees to inflation rather than the more generous wage rate, and creating a private account program for younger workers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m all for eliminating waste and ending the practice of pork-barrel spending but if anyone thinks this will significantly reduce the massive Federal deficit and pay for McCain’s tax cuts, let me suggest they return to kindergarten and start over with their math skills.  It would seem, however, that the McCain camp is signaling that they want to reduce Social Security benefits.  After all, McCain considers this program to be a <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/203378.php">disgrace</a>.  As a Democrat, I’d love this Republican position to get a lot more air time with the mainstream media.</p>

<p>by Noni Mausa</p>
<p>From the online medical news resource <a href="http://www.medscape.com/home">Medscape</a>, a very rich source of breaking health news, comes this study from the World Health Organization on worldwide drug use. Once again, world leader America takes the Number One position!</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>U.S. Leads the World in Illegal Drug Use<br />Jennifer Warner</p>
<p>WebMD Health News 2008. © 2008 WebMD Inc.</p>
<p>July 3, 2008 — Despite tough anti-drug laws, a new survey shows the U.S. has the highest level of illegal drug use in the world.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization&#8217;s survey of legal and illegal drug use in 17 countries, including the Netherlands and other countries with less stringent drug laws, shows Americans report the highest level of cocaine and marijuana use.</p>
<p>For example, Americans were four times more likely to report using cocaine in their lifetime than the next closest country, New Zealand (16% vs. 4%),</p>
<p>Marijuana use was more widely reported worldwide, and the U.S. also had the highest rate of use at 42.4% compared with 41.9% of New Zealanders.</p>
<p>In contrast, in the Netherlands, which has more liberal drug policies than the U.S., only 1.9% of people reported cocaine use and 19.8% reported marijuana use.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>From the report: &#8220;Legal and illegal use of drugs was most strongly associated with age, sex, and income. Higher income was associated with a greater likelihood of drug use for all drug types examined, which is perhaps not surprising given that drug use requires disposable income&#8230;.The use of drugs seems to be a feature of more affluent countries. The US&#8230; stands out with higher levels of use of alcohol, cocaine, and cannabis, despite punitive illegal drug policies, as well as (in many US states), a higher minimum legal alcohol drinking age than many comparable developed countries.&#8221;</p>
<p>The entire Medscape article is <a href="http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/577082">here</a> and the actual report is <a request="'get-document&#038;doi=">here</a>.</p>
<p>****<br />Comment from Noni: For some time I have thought that the rush and anxiety and the &#8220;lean and mean&#8221; approach to business have acted to supercharge the US demand for various drugs, either to escape the anxiety (cannabis, alcohol) or compete more fiercely in a business environment where a successful, admired participant has many of the qualities usually associated with a person taking cocaine and other stimulants. (&#8220;He&#8217;s amazing! He gets by on four hours of sleep a night, and just LOOK at his energy! Let&#8217;s make him our CEO!&#8221;)</p>
<p>And now, with the air hissing out of the balloon of US disposable income, what will happen to the lucrative drug trade? I won&#8217;t even guess, it could go either way, and I suppose it will. Another blow to the GDP.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />This one by reader noni mausa</p>

<p>(Lifted from comments cactus style)</p>
<p>I have reviewed the majority of American econ blogs during the past few days. Hit the supposed heavy ones again tonight. The econ blog subjects range from stupid to domestic but very few step beyond the borders of the USA. It&#8217;s as though the lights are turned off, except at home. A very narrow focus, indeed. Perhaps a selfish one. </p>
<p>There are exceptions, but damn few. This situation represents a ridiculous state of affairs in the so-called &#8220;thinking&#8221; of American economists, analysts, and others providing main posts on econ blogs. </p>
<p>I make this statement in light of the global crises and other issues facing the nations of the world. Not to be overlooked is the wording of the call for action that was issued directly to the G8 by the World Bank. </p>
<p>WASHINGTON, July 2, 2008 World Bank <a href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/NEWS/0,,contentMDK:21828803~pagePK:34370~piPK:34424~theSitePK:4607,00.html">World Bank President to G8: World Entering a Danger Zone</a></p>
<blockquote><p>For the first time since 1973, the world is being hit with a combination of record oil and food prices, threatening to drive over 100 million people into extreme poverty and reverse the gains made in overcoming poverty over the last seven years.</p>
<p>Some 41 countries have lost 3% to 10% of their GDP from rising food, fuel and commodity prices since January 2007. Over 30 countries have been hit by food riots, as the impact of the crisis reaches the household level.</p></blockquote>
<p>(quote added by rdan)</p>
<p>What part of that phrase and text communication is not understood by economists and others posting on econ blogs? Did they bother to read the article or listen to the news? </p>
<p>Will there be the usual phony or disingenuous blog posts and statements later on that &#8220;we&#8221; (&#8220;I&#8221;) didn&#8217;t see the impending disasters coming? &#8220;We&#8221; (&#8220;I&#8221;) didn&#8217;t know that the collective situation could lead to another World War over resources, let alone any war or spread of violence across struggling nations? </p>
<p>How many more phony excuses going forward do we need to hear from professionals and others who say that they understand or have a good grasp of global economic data and affairs? </p>
<p>If you can see it in the developing stages, warn your readership. That&#8217;s what adults and professionals are supposed to do &#8211; keep others informed. Get off your hands. Read. Think. Analyze. Inform. The American econ blog community needs to wake up and focus on the global crises and more serious issues than some of the tripe that is being posting across econ blogland. I say that with all seriousness. </p>
<p>The cartoons are over. Move to the main feature &#8211; the global economy which is in early stages of major crises that may result in significant social upheavel, economic collapse, and, ultimately, regional or global warfare. If it&#8217;s necessary to lean on the G8 leaders and call out the U.S. Presidential candidates, then let&#8217;s do it. And soon.</p>

Boomers are sponging off the next generation.</p>
<p>I will look for a transcript&#8230;this is not in his plan. If this is the way he plans to play it, I go public as well..<br /><strong><br />Update: Below the fold is a transcript on Social Security. </strong>The first two paragraphs appear to imply that Social Security was originally a mortgaging of the future.</p>
<p>The next appears to say there is no such thing as a generational connection, and that the current surplus pays for tax cuts for services provided now.</p>
<p>While there are some who say entitlements are broken, he excludes Medicare and other programs to say SS is broken specifically, without regard to the trustees report at all.<br /><strong><br />Update 2:</strong> Hat tip to reader yadda yadda (brooks) for a link to the full session.

<p><strong>Update 3:</strong> <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/07/a-disgrace.html">Economist&#8217;s View</a> has a post that includes Dean Baker, Kevin Drum, hilzoy, and Paul Krugman in posts, and of course the gang in comments.</p>
<p><strong>Update 4:</strong> <a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2008/05/social-security-posts-on-angry-bear.html">Bruce Webb on Social Security</a> is the best you can find anywhere for accurate thinking on the subject.</p>
<p><strong>Update 5:</strong>  <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/~/%20media...scal_future.pdf">The Brookings Institute</a> has a well read paper on Social Security that confirms much of what we say.  Interpretation may vary on some particulars.</p>
<blockquote><p>MCCAIN: Thank you very much. I’d like to start out by giving you a little straight talk. Under the present set-up, because we&#8217;ve mortgaged our children&#8217;s futures, you will not have Social Security benefits that present-day retirees have unless we fix it. And Americans have got to understand that.</p>
<p>Americans have got to understand that we are paying present-day retirees with the taxes paid by young workers in America today. And that&#8217;s a disgrace. It&#8217;s an absolute disgrace, and it&#8217;s got to be fixed.</p>
<p>Now, how do you fix it? Now, how do you fix it? You fix it by reaching across the aisle, and you say to the Democrats, &#8220;Sit down with me at the table. Sit down with me, the way Ronald Reagan and Tip O&#8217;Neill did the last time that Social Security was in deep trouble, and that was way back in 1983.&#8221;<br />Ronald Reagan, a conservative president from California, Tip O&#8217;Neill, the liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, sat down together, and they walked out of the White House together, and they said, &#8220;We&#8217;re going to fix Social Security.&#8221; And they did, for about 20, 30 years. Right, Hank?</p>
<p>And Hank Brown and I were in the Congress at the time. And we were proud. We were proud to see the kind of bipartisanship that was exhibited for future generations.</p>
<p>Well, now it&#8217;s broken again. Now it&#8217;s broken again. Nothing is forever in America. I want to promise you that I&#8217;ll say to the Democrats and I&#8217;ll say to the American people: “Here&#8217;s a chart. Here&#8217;s how much is coming in. Here&#8217;s how much is going out. And here&#8217;s where there&#8217;s more money going out than coming in, and here&#8217;s where there&#8217;s no money left.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, are we going to hand it off to your generation to fix it? Or are we going to do the hard things? I want to be president to do the hard things. And I promise you that I&#8217;ll do everything in my power to make sure that not only Social Security but Medicare is addressed, and it has to be done in a bipartisan fashion. And Washington is broke, and we&#8217;re grid-locked by partisanship, and it&#8217;s going to change, and it&#8217;s got to change, and I will change it.</p></blockquote>
