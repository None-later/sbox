<div><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/14/bush-tax-cut-mythology">Paul Krugman</a> made a claim recently that sort of threw me until I actually graphed the data:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>EGTRRA arrived in the middle of a recession, but that was an accident. It was devised in 1999, when the economy was booming, to defend Bush’s right flank against Steve Forbes. During the 2000 campaign, Bush sold it as a way of returning budget surpluses to the people, with not a hint that it had something to do with fighting recession. The recession story was an after-the-fact reinvention. And EGTRRA didn’t seem to help all that much. Formally, the recession ended in late 2001, but most labor-market indicators continued to worsen into mid-2003. JGTRRA, which mainly cut tax rates on capital gains and dividends, was followed by a real recovery. And the Bushies naturally claimed the credit. But the real source of the expansion was the housing boom, which had very little to do with the tax cut.</p></blockquote>
<p>Krugman’s claim that “EGTRRA didn’t seem to help all that much” has been sort of picked up by the free lunch supply-side school of utter BS. Even though they were for the 2001 tax cut then, they now claim this was someone else’s idea – not theirs. So let’s focus on JGTRRA, which the supply-side kiddies claim was the Nirvana – or something like that.</p>
<p>While we have provided three graphs, focus on the first for a moment. Each graph is taken from NIPA table 1.1.3, which can be found <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">here</a>, and shows real GDP in index form with the 2000 level = 100 (side note directed at CoRev – when trolls accuse me of lying and/or not providing links, please don’t back their BS). Business investment (Inv-b) tanked after 2000 and not surprisingly did recover somewhat (second side note to CoRev – if you wish to dub the investment led recession which I have often talked about the “Y2K” effect, fine by me). But notice something – real business investment as of 2007Q3 was only 12.6% higher than it was as of 2000. And even with the rather anemic overall real GDP growth over the past 7 years, real GDP as of 2007Q3 was still 18.9% higher than it was as of 2000. This was not exactly a business investment led recovery. Now one could say that consumption has increased relative to real GDP. But as far as domestic private spending, Krugman is right about residential investment demand leading the way through 2005 and the very early part of 2006. Since then, we have seen a sharp drop in residential investment demand.</p>
<p>Our second graph shows real exports and real imports. During the lean years, export demand actually fell but has recovered nicely. Both export demand and import demand are now about 32% higher than they were as of 2000.</p>
<p>Our third graph shows the three components of government purchases. State and local (S&#038;L) spending growth has been quite modest and might be seen as a drag on aggregate demand growth. Real nondefense Federal purchases (Nondef) have grown at about the same rate of real GDP. But notice the sharp growth in defense spending (Def), which now stands at 38.8% of its 2000 level. If this wasn’t part of the aggregate demand stimulus – what was? Then again, wasn’t this the point made by <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2007/01/escalation_and_1.html">Menzie Chinn</a> about a year ago? </div>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/01/the-risk-of-the.html">Andrew Sullivan</a>, <a rhef="http://www.marinecorpstimes.com/news/2008/01/marine_stretched_080114w/">this article in the Marine Corps Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If the U.S. were to face a new conventional threat, its military could not respond effectively without turning to air power, officials and analysts say.</p>
<p>That is the ultimate upshot of the war in Iraq: a response elsewhere would consist largely of U.S. fighters and bombers — even, perhaps, some degree of nuclear strike — because so many ground troops are tied up in Operation Iraqi Freedom.</p>
<p>And that leaves at least some senior U.S. leaders and analysts crossing their fingers.</p>
<p>“I believe that we, as a nation, are at risk of mission failure should our Army be called to deploy to an emerging threat,” Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Texas, chairman of the House Armed Services readiness subcommittee, said last year, basing his assessment on classified Army readiness reports.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Army is bearing the brunt of the fight, and senior leaders readily acknowledge that.</p>
<p>“We are consumed with meeting the demands of the current fight and unable to provide ready forces as rapidly as necessary for other contingencies,” Army Chief of Staff Gen. George Casey told the Senate Armed Services Committee on Nov. 15.</p>
<p>The Congressional Budget Office reported in 2006 that Army readiness rates had declined to the lowest levels since the end of the Vietnam War, with roughly half of all Army units, active and reserve, at the lowest readiness ratings for currently available units. Casey told the Senate committee that training and readiness levels for nondeployed units have “actually stayed about the same since last summer — and it’s not good</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>But readiness problems are not limited to the ground forces. Air Force operational readiness rates are 17 percent below the level before Sept. 11, 2001 — only 53 percent of Air Force units, many using aging aircraft that require more frequent repairs, were considered “green,” or fully mission-capable, as of March, according to service data.</p>
<p>“The Air Force’s case is a lot different than the other services,” said an Air Force officer with extensive Pentagon staff experience who asked not to be identified. “This is not an air war. This is a ground war that is being fought with a lot of air power.”</p>
<p>Only the Navy, not heavily tasked with Iraq war duties, feels like it’s ready to take on another contingency.</p>
<p>“The Navy’s current readiness remains excellent,” Adm. Robert Willard, vice chief of naval operations, told the House subcommittee in March.</p>
<p>But even that service’s budget has been trimmed to support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, resulting in fewer steaming days for nondeployed forces.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Most spec-ops specialties are chronically underfilled, according to a June CNAS report by Schultz and Michèle Flournoy, “Shaping Ground Forces for the Future.”</p>
<p>They also note that 85 percent of all deployed Army Special Forces troops are working in the U.S. Central Command area of operations, leaving few available for other missions.</p>
<p>National Guard and reserve forces also are getting a sustained workout that is causing major strains on what were once known as “weekend warriors.”</p>
<p>As Casey put it: “Our reserve components are performing an operational role for which they were neither originally designed nor resourced.”</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/01/indirect-impact.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes a discussion of a negative externality from the privatization of toll roads provided by <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-01/ps-trp011408.php">Steve Hevner</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Privatizing toll roads in the U.S. may result in significant diversions of truck traffic from privatized toll roads to &#8220;free&#8221; roads, and may result in more crashes and increased costs associated with use of other roads, according to a new study. Peter Swan of Penn State – Harrisburg and Michael Belzer of Wayne State University will present the findings of their study, &#8220;Empirical Evidence of Toll Road Traffic Diversion and Implications for Highway Infrastructure Privatization&#8221; on Jan. 14 at the 87th annual meeting of the Transportation Research Board in Washington, D.C. The study used data from the State of Ohio, the Federal Highway Administration, and the Ohio Turnpike to predict annual Turnpike truck vehicle miles traveled, and therefore diverted vehicle miles, based on National truck traffic and Turnpike rates. The researchers then compare estimated truck traffic diverted from the Turnpike to truck traffic on Ohio road segments on possible substitute routes. Both economic models support the hypothesis that rate increases divert traffic from toll roads to &#8220;free&#8221; roads. </p></blockquote>
<p>But why would trucks change their driving habits as a result of privatization?  Steve continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The study concludes that if governments allow private toll road operators to maximize profits, higher tolls will divert trucks to local roads, depending on the suitability of substitute roads. The authors estimate that for 2005, a for-profit, private operator of the Ohio Turnpike could have raised tolls to roughly three times what they were under the public turnpike authority, resulting in about a 40% diversion of trucks from the Ohio Turnpike to other roads. </p></blockquote>
<p>Supporters of privatization typically argue that the price that the government receives more than makes up for the present value of lost toll roads.  But notice something about these present value calculations – they assume the lower toll rate, while the private company’s bid is based on the ability to increase the toll rates.  In other words, there is a transfer of wealth away from drivers.  Add to this the inefficiency effects from monopoly style toll rates and the effect that Steve mentions – and we get as very different cost-benefit calculation than the ones we often see from the supporters of privatization.</p>

                                <p>Via Avedon Carol&#8217;s <a rhef="http://sideshow.me.uk/sjan08.htm#01151255">Sideshow</a>, this at <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/01/13/ford-car-owners-are.html">Boing Boing</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Josh sez, &#8220;The folks at BMC (Black Mustang Club) automotive forum wanted to put together a calendar featuring members&#8217; cars, and print it through CafePress. Photos were submitted, the layout was set, and&#8230; CafePress notifies the site admin that pictures of Ford cars cannot be printed. Not just Ford logos, not just Mustang logos, the car -as a whole- is a Ford trademark and its image can&#8217;t be reproduced without permission. So even though Ford has a lineup of enthusiasts who want to show off their Ford cars, the company is bent on alienating them. &#8216;Them&#8217; being some of the most loyal owners and future buyers that they have. Or rather, that they had, because many have decided that they will not be doing business with Ford again if this matter isn&#8217;t resolved.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently Ford actually contacted CafePress and said that any images with a Ford vehicle in them infringe on Ford&#8217;s trademark.</p>
<p>A few comments:</p>
<p>1.  This really isn&#8217;t very bright.  As the quote I posted notes, Ford is alienating some very good customers.  (I once knew a member of a Mustang club.  These people love their cars.  And spend a lot of money.)  <br />2.  Members of these clubs often make major modifications to their vehicles.  How big of a modification would it take to make a vehicle no longer infringe on Ford&#8217;s trademark?<br />3.  Will makers of tv shows have to get permission from Ford every time a character jumps into a Ford vehicle?<br />4.  I wonder when its going to occur to the makers of paint that perhaps Ford just might be infringing on their trademark.</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s one thing for Greenspan to sell books and give speeches to try to salvage his reputation. Nixon did that too, with more success and less profit. It is quite another for him to benefit in a far more direct fashion from the devastation he created, by hooking up with the fund that scored the biggest kill from the worst aspects of the negative real interest rates that Greenspan put into effect.</p>
<p>Overly cheap credit always and inevitably leads to bad investments, And Greenspan of all people should have known that. How he can rationalize his actions then and now is beyond me. But I forgot. Objectivism means never having to say you&#8217;re sorry.</p>
<p>Actually, it is worse than that. More than 50 years ago, this country could be awakened from its nightmare of Joe McCarthy-led Communist-in-every-closet witch hunting by the exposure of McCarthy&#8217;s methods in the first nationally televised Congressional hearings. The pivotal moment occurred when a Boston lawyer, Joseph Welch, rebuked McCarthy with the now-famous phrase, &#8220;Have you no sense of decency, sir, at long last? Have you left no sense of decency?&#8221;</p>
<p>But decency and propriety mean nothing in America these days. What used to be recognized as corruption is now shrugged off as business as usual. When a nation loses its moral compass, it also loses its soul.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Iraqi defense minister said Monday that his nation would not be able to take full responsibility for its internal security until 2012, nor be able on its own to defend Iraq’s borders from external threat until at least 2018.</p>
<p>Those comments from the minister, Abdul Qadir, were among the most specific public projections of a timeline for the American commitment in Iraq by officials in either Washington or Baghdad. And they suggested a longer commitment than either government had previously indicated.</p>
<p>Pentagon officials expressed no surprise at Mr. Qadir’s projections, which were even less optimistic than those he made last year. </p></blockquote>
<p>Presumably, the fighting won&#8217;t still be ongoing fifteen years after the 2003 invasion.  Very few wars last that long (though it does happen).  Which means what?  Training Iraqis?  I&#8217;ve asked before, I&#8217;ll ask again&#8230; how long does it take to train Iraqi forces?</p>

                                <p>Noni Mausa sends <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/14/nyregion/14citywide.html?pagewanted=1&#038;th&#038;emc=th">this from today&#8217;s New York Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After spending a year and a half in a homeless shelter with his wife and two young daughters, Mr. Guzman is living in a railroad flat at the edge of Bushwick, just across the subway tracks from a cemetery. The city is paying most of the family&#8217;s $1,170 monthly rent this year&#8230;Mr. Guzman &#8230; makes only $7.15 an hour &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>She adds&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A few scribbles on the back of an envelope tell me that $7.15 / hour full time, pays  $14,872 before taxes.  The annual rent for the substandard home in the article is $14,040.</p>
<p>A question for the list &#8212; how is this rent subsidy, presented as a benefit to the working poor, actually not a huge subsidy to business?</p>
<p>And before you go for the red herring &#8212; yes, I know in the article Mr. Guzman works at the shelter where he and his family lived for 18 months, but plenty of other working poor in NYC work for similar wages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cactus here&#8230;  Its only semi-related, but Noni&#8217;s post made me think about it and I&#8217;d like to add this as a comment.  One of the arguments folks on the right make against a corporate income tax is that they tell us the tax ends up being passed onto the workers of the corporation.  If that&#8217;s the case&#8230;  given that a subsidy is just a negative tax, if many of a company&#8217;s workers make a low enough wage to qualify for assistance from the government, would most people on the right suggest the best way to help those workers is to cut off all their assistance completely and give a lump sump to the company?</p>

                                <p>Three guesses as to who wrote <a href="http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/keynes/john_maynard/k44g">The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money</a>. OK, most of you got that it was John Maynard Keynes on your first guess.</p>
<p>So why ask such a silly question? <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/watching_conservatives_/2008/01/was_the_founder_of_fascism_a_fascist.php">Mark Kleiman</a> provides a clue as he points us to <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/01/13/jonah-goldbergs-revisionist-definitions">Nicole Belle</a> who notes Goldberg claimed:</p>
<blockquote><p>To sort of start the story, the reason why we see fascism as a thing of the right is because fascism was originally a form of right-wing socialism. Mussolini was born a socialist, he died a socialist, he never abandoned his love of socialism, he was one of the most important socialist intellectuals in Europe and was one of the most important socialist activists in Italy, and the only reason he got dubbed a fascist and therefore a right-winger is because he supported World War I.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nicole, however, reminds us:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Mussolini was dubbed a fascist because he founded the Fascist Party.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Mark notes:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Is there absolutely no limit on how clueless and intellectually dishonest you can be while still remaining a respected &#8220;conservative&#8221; commentator, in the current, debased sense of the word &#8220;conservative&#8221;? Guess not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then again – Jonah’s rightwing economic know nothing friends often declare the General Theory to be one of the ten most evil books of all times even though none of them likely bothered to read it.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/14/opinion/14krugman.html?ex=1357966800&#038;en=4f4a13fb46e57128&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink">Paul Krugman</a> asks reporters to examine what each of the main Presidential candidates propose to do about what appears to be a weakening economy. It should not be any surprise that he does not have kind things to say about the nonsense coming from the GOP debates but he does have a few good things to say about two of the three leading Democrats. But it was this that caught my attention:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Obama campaign’s initial response to the latest wave of bad economic news was, I’m sorry to say, disreputable: Mr. Obama’s top economic adviser claimed that the long-term tax-cut plan the candidate announced months ago is just what we need to keep the slump from “morphing into a drastic decline in consumer spending.” Hmm: claiming that the candidate is all-seeing, and that a tax cut originally proposed for other reasons is also a recession-fighting measure &#8211; doesn’t that sound familiar?</p></blockquote>
<p>If not, read <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2002/08/08/news/economy/bush_forum/index.htm">this</a> and let’s discuss:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bush and Cheney have said that the tax cut was perfectly timed to help the economy return to growth after three straight quarters of contraction in 2001. In fact, Bush has asked for the tax cut, which expires in 10 years, to be made permanent to fuel future economic growth. But Democrats and other critics have noted that the tax cut, which in part benefited higher-income taxpayers, helped wipe out a federal budget surplus carefully crafted during the Clinton administration, possibly threatening the economy&#8217;s future health. &#8220;It was a very difficult and very important achievement to get a balanced budget and a budget surplus, which Clinton did,&#8221; said Roger Altman, a deputy treasury secretary under Clinton and founder of Evercore Partners in Washington. &#8220;In the blink of an eye, that fiscal discipline &#8211; which in turn permitted monetary policy to be stimulative and gave confidence to investors and businesses, and had a role in the economic performance of the United States in the late 1990s &#8211; has been dropped.&#8221; &#8220;The prospect of a $165 billion budget deficit is a very negative development that is undermining business and investor confidence,&#8221; Altman added. Other critics are alarmed by the Bush administration&#8217;s apparent refusal to bend from certain pet ideas &#8211; the tax cut was presented in 1999 as the only logical response to the boom and was re-packaged in 2001 as the only logical response to the doldrums. &#8220;They came in a year and a half ago with a set of preconceived notions, and nothing, no event, no conceivable event, seems to get them to modify any aspect of that,&#8221; said William Gale, senior fellow for economic studies at the Brookings Institution.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lawrence Lindsey once told Tim Russert that the “economics profession” had declared his 1999 tax cut proposal to be one that we perfectly timed. It would seem that it was Dr. Lindsey who made this claim so I guess he considers himself to be the entire profession. But it is true that he and George W. Bush designed their set of back-loaded giveaways for the rich during a period when the economy was booming. If Dr. Lindsey was forecasting the 2001 recession two years in advance, maybe he should have published his most insightful forecast. As far as how this was designed, it certainly failed the targeted and temporary principles that we have <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/01/douglas-elmendorf-and-jason-furman-on.html">recently</a> heard much about.</p>
<p>For Senator Obama to be playing this supposed omniscient game with a tax cut that was not perfectly designed to combat a recession strikes me as rather bad politics if one wishes to capture the Democratic nomination. After all – we should leave the praising of past GOP Administrations to those clowns who think the road map to the White House starts at the alter of Saint Ronald.</p>
