                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2182709/fr/rss/">Slate</a> has an article on AARP designed legislation in Georgia.</p>
<blockquote><p>Under the <a href="http://dbf.georgia.gov/vgn/images/portal/cit_1210/56/7/64943073GAFLA-OCGA7-6A.pdf#12" target="_blank">Georgia Fair Lending Act</a>, however, players in the secondary mortgage market could face serious liability if they so much as touched a predatory loan. The AARP, which drafted the <a href="http://assets.aarp.org/rgcenter/consume/d17346_loan.pdf" target="_blank">model legislation</a> that formed the basis for the Georgia law, explained that imposing liability on downstream owners would &#8220;reduce significantly the amount of credit that is available to lenders who are not willing to ensure that the loans they finance are made in accordance with the law.&#8221;<br />&#8230;<br />The secondary market has an extraordinarily difficult time, however, distinguishing predatory loans (bad) from appropriately priced subprime loans (good). Even if the line could be drawn with confidence, the market lacked the resources to gather the necessary information. As the General Accounting Office noted in its <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04280.pdf#page=17" target="_blank">comprehensive review</a> of predatory-lending legislation, &#8220;even the most stringent efforts cannot uncover some predatory loans.&#8221;<br />Inevitably, then, the secondary mortgage market in Georgia&#8217;s subprime loans ground to a halt. And that was the point: If buyers couldn&#8217;t satisfy themselves that the loans they bought weren&#8217;t predatory, they should take their money elsewhere. Georgia understood that impeding the capital flow to subprime loans might raise the cost of borrowing for some state residents—those who, for one reason or another, had poor credit but could and would repay high-priced loans. But Georgia judged that this was more than balanced by protection for its most vulnerable from the scourge of predatory lending and the wrenching costs associated with overpayment and eventual foreclosure. <a href="http://www.banking.state.ny.us/mb6l.htm" target="_blank">New York</a>, <a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2002/Bills/PL03/64_.PDF" target="_blank">New Jersey</a>, and <a href="http://rld.state.nm.us/FID/PDFs/Home%20Loan%20Protection%20Act.pdf" target="_blank">New Mexico</a> made the same judgment and within two years had enacted their own versions of laws exposing downstream owners of loans to fines if they bought predatory loans.<br />&#8230;<br />The OCC is a somewhat conflicted agency: While its primary regulatory responsibility is ensuring the safety and soundness of the national bank system, almost its <a href="http://www.occ.gov/aboutocc.htm" target="_blank">entire budget</a> comes from fees it imposes on the banks—meaning that its funding depends on keeping them happy. It was unsurprising, then, that the OCC leapt to attention <a href="http://www.occ.treas.gov/toolkit/newsrelease.aspx?Doc=EMRDRG7D.xml" target="_blank">when the national banks asked it</a> to pre-empt the Georgia-like subprime laws on the grounds that they conflicted with federal banking law.<br />While the banks&#8217; legal arguments <a href="http://banking.senate.gov/_files/wilmarth.pdf" target="_blank">were</a> <a href="http://www.law.nyu.edu/journals/lawreview/issues/vol79/no6/NYU604.pdf" target="_blank">thin</a>, the OCC issued <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2004_register&#038;position=all&#038;page=1904" target="_blank">regulations</a> in early 2004 nullifying the state laws as they applied to national banks. In part, the OCC reasoned that the states just got it wrong: As the then-comptroller <a href="http://www.occ.treas.gov/ftp/release/2003-57a.pdf" target="_blank">explained</a> in a speech to the Federalist Society, &#8220;We know that it&#8217;s possible to deal effectively with predatory lending without putting impediments in the way of those who provide access to legitimate subprime credit.&#8221; With the state laws nullified, national banks were free to engage in the sharp practices the states were hoping to stamp out. (Indeed, Georgia <a href="http://dbf.georgia.gov/vgn/images/portal/cit_1210/56/7/64943073GAFLA-OCGA7-6A.pdf#page=13" target="_blank">scuttled</a> its law because it didn&#8217;t want to give national banks a competitive advantage over its state institutions.)</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>John Edwards has no hope of winning the Democratic nomination, and unlike, say, Ron Paul, is unlikely to run as a third party candidate.   He also isn&#8217;t exactly getting his message across &#8211; the press following the Dem candidates focuses almost exclusively on the two main candidates.  Also, he also doesn&#8217;t strike me as an idiot (though being an idiot doesn&#8217;t preclude a person from running, or even winning the Presidency).  So what is he doing still in the race?</p>
<p>Well, he&#8217;s young enough to have more runs for the presidency (or at least for his party&#8217;s nomination) in him, and he clearly has the wherewithal (money, ambition, charisma) to do it again.  So, he&#8217;s probably running for election not in 2008, but in 2012 (if a Republican is elected in 2008) or 2016.</p>
<p>How do you go about becoming President if you&#8217;re John Edwards then?  The first thing is not to piss off either of the two big gorillas until you either know which one is going to win, or, ideally, until you can cast the deciding vote as kingmaker.  And you don&#8217;t become kingmaker unless you stay in the race and keep picking up nominees.</p>
<p>If you do become kingmaker, what do you want for it?  The obvious slot is the VP slot.  But, in recent decades, the only veep to go on to get an upgrade (without the president dying or being forced out of office, which isn&#8217;t something you can count on happening) was GHW, and it didn&#8217;t hurt that he ran against Michael Dukakis.   Being a VP is also risky&#8230; its not a position that calls the shots, but your fortunes rise and fall on how the President has done.  But there are VPs that do call some shots.  Cheney is a prime example.  Gore was put in charge of &#8220;re-inventing government.&#8221;  Its possible for a kingmaker to get some high profile responsibilities (whether with the VP slot or some cabinet level posting) and a guarantee that enough resources will flow in that direction that only an idiot would fail to look good at it. </p>
<p>I would guess that&#8217;s what John Edwards wants to do.</p>

That said, I would have no problem supporting him if he was the eventual Democratic nominee.  In my opinion, whatever the weaknesses of the three main Democrats, and there are many, they seem to me to be an order of magnitude more rational than the Republicans that have looked like viable contenders for their party&#8217;s nomination.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s OldVet&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/01/28/080128fa_fact_packer?currentPage=1">Here</a> is a very well researched and written article on Hillary, and appears to be even handed. Not much on Obama, and nothing on what is appealing about Edwards, but they have less public history. Choice of two approaches to Presidency are well laid out, and I would agree choices are clear.</p>
<p>From 30 years in bureaucracy, I think Hillary overestimates her potential impact to manage programs that are circumscribed by laws and regulations built up by accretion like an oyster shell. Bill never had much success at it, I can assure you. Normal civil servants don&#8217;t work for a particular President, but for the People. They almost never couch it like that, but that&#8217;s how they see it. And managing bureaucracy is not the same thing as changing the country, by a long shot. Too many people, either by design or ignorance, ascribe magical powers to Big Gubmint to change their lives for the better &#8220;if only they would.&#8221;</p>
<p>A little secret about government is this: at the root, the core, government is not about transforming lives through social messages and education or any other Utopian mechanism. It&#8217;s just a big old washing machine, a money laundering device that takes in money and spins it around and distributes it in all directions. Controlling the money is controlling the machine, and that&#8217;s what good management in government means. Money comes in from rich and poor, and goes out to rich and poor, in all types of channels and under all types of labels. But it&#8217;s really money laundering, nothing more. That&#8217;s why those desperate little &#8220;earmarks&#8221; are festooned on Congressional spending bills &#8211; it&#8217;s a feeble attempt, and a misguided one IMHO, to show voters that their Reps are in control of what counts. </p>
<p>In this, despite being around elective politics a long time, Hillary misunderstands what a President needs to do. It&#8217;s not manage the bureaucracy so much as lead the country. She needs enemies, and tends to sabotage herself according to the article.</p>
<p>Packer opines about a New Hampshire appearance: &#8220;She wouldn&#8217;t risk the loss of control that it might take to energize the room with humor or anger or argument, or the sort of spontaneous human touch that everyone who spends private time with her notices and likes. A number of people drifted away before she had finished.&#8221; Dee Dee Myers ends the article&#8217;s quotes: &#8220;But the Presidency isn&#8217;t all that powerful, except as the bully pulpit. It comes down to your ability to get people to follow you, to inspire. You have to lead. Can she get people to come together, or does she remain such a polarizing figure? That&#8217;s what the campaign will be about.&#8221; In other words, winning the Presidency might require Clinton to transcend her own history.&#8221;</p>
<p>Obama does not offer detailed management in the Oval Office, and clearly does not feel that&#8217;s the role of President. Inspiring and leading 300 million fractious people is a greater good than being a familiar Democratic political wonk who grinds through policy details. For this very different vision, Obama is deemed &#8220;risky&#8221; by Bill Clinton, and Hillary implies there is something lazy in not being a micro-manager. In my own opinion, Obama is more on the right track, and has the same sense of politics as both Kennedy&#8217;s and Reagan, and all of their skill to boot.</p>
<p>An important difference between Clinton and Obama is whether compromise and inclusiveness are strengths or weaknesses. Clinton hates the right wing, believes it will never compromise, and knows it will attempt to chew Obama to pieces. She&#8217;s ready to attack. Obama feels that reaching out to Republicans and Independents will form a mass coalition that will overwhelm both political extremes, and that leadership (his own?) can guide that coalition not to compromise with the cruel vision of the corporate and social special interests. </p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s vision is very close to the Bill Clinton program which brought him such successes as he had, including balanced budgets and a reduction of the Federal workforce by 300,000, as well as a healthy 20 million jobs increase and a booming stock market. Today, Bill Clinton attacks Obama for this same approach, forgetting Democrats aren&#8217;t nostalgic for Bill so much as nostalgic for the good years of cooperation between Demos and Repubs. </p>
<p>Quote: A Clinton associate put it this way to Carl Bernstein: &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure I want the circus back in town.&#8221; To which I say, Amen. Bill Clinton is distorting Obama&#8217;s record and words to win office today, allegedly on behalf of Hillary. In reality it&#8217;s an ego trip, not only for him but for Hillary, who was humiliated in 1994 over the universal health care plan. Republicans whipped up opposition, were far more clever than the Democrats, and she and Bill want to kick their asses one more time. Enough already!</p>
<p>Finally, unexamined in the article is whether a &#8220;hands off&#8221; Obama is like a &#8220;hands off&#8221; Bush, and whether Obama&#8217;s style is a sure sign of incompetence to come. The nation shudders at the thought of another George Bush, the smirking and inarticulate menace in the White House. Personally, I don&#8217;t see Obama&#8217;s education and style as comparable to the back-slapping dry-drunk posturing we are subjected to by Bush.</p>
<p>The reason is that Obama is more likely to attract the most dedicated and brightest minds in the country to help manage both civilian and national security departments. He is that kind of man.</p>
<p>Right now, as dawn breaks in South Carolina and February 5th&#8217;s &#8220;Super Tuesday&#8221; approaches, I&#8217;m assessing Obama&#8217;s chances. He has been effectively triangulated by the two Clintons playing Mutt &#038; Jeff on his head in public. Even if he beats them, which would be a Herculean task given their trench fighting skills, he will be tarred and damaged by their attacks.</p>
<p>At this stage, Obama needs to establish an immediate salient in the area of National Security which is both Clinton&#8217;s and McCain&#8217;s ostensible areas of expertise. He needs to attack Hillary&#8217;s compromises on Iraq, and refusal to admit her mistakes, while establish that McCain, while himself a military icon, would gleefully subject thousands of young Americans to the same wounds and tortures as those to which he was himself subjected in Viet Nam. Obama needs to make the point that McCain is a war monger and militarist who revels in the use of force, and that Hillary Clinton is a fellow-traveler.</p>
<p>In my own opinion, Obama needs new Democratic Senator Jim Webb of Virginia. He is fully compatible with the social tenants of Obama, and wrote a magnificent editorial called &#8220;Class Struggle&#8221; just prior to the 2006 election to be found <a href="http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009246">here</a>.  Sen. Webb could help carry Virginia and some of the South, unlike Edwards, and his war record in Viet Nam is equal to McCain&#8217;s &#8211; he earned a Silver Star, and served as Navy Secretary under Reagan. He later wrote adventure books and is a student of war and politics, and his son has served in Iraq. Without a bold stroke &#8211; and a quick one such as enlisting Webb as his VP-designate &#8211; Obama may well be ground into submission in both the Primary, and later the General elections.</p>
<p>Re-reading this, it sounds like an endorsement of Obama. I guess it is. I voted for him in Tennessee early voting this week. Cheers</p>

I don&#8217;t know who that is, and I don&#8217;t agree with some of what&#8217;s in his article, but I do agree with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is also as ironic as it was predictable that Alan Greenspan &#8211; Ayn Rand “disciple” and free-market ideologue &#8211; championed monetary policies and a financial apparatus that will ensure the greatest government intrusion into our Nation’s financial and economic affairs since the New Deal. Articles berating contemporary Capitalism are becoming commonplace. I fear that the most important lesson from this experience may fail to resonate: that to promote sustainable free-market Capitalism for the real economy demands considerable general resolve to protect the soundness and stability of the underlying Credit system.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Adler Center for Research in Child Development and Psychopathology, Department of Psychology, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Israel<br />OBJECTIVE. The goal was to assess stress reactions in young children during and after war and the effects of a new brief intervention.</p>
<p>METHODS. Two separate studies were conducted. In study I, we assessed war exposure and stress reactions of 74 children (2–7 years of age) in a sheltered camp during the second Israel-Lebanon war (July to August 2006). Their exposure to war experiences and their stress reactions were assessed through parental reports during the last week of the war. In addition to standard care, 35 children received a brief intervention (Huggy-Puppy intervention) aimed at encouraging them to care for a needy Huggy-Puppy doll that was given to them as a gift. The effects of the Huggy-Puppy intervention were assessed in a follow-up interview 3 weeks after the war. Study II assessed the efficacy of group administration of the Huggy-Puppy intervention to 191 young children, compared with 101 control subjects. The effects of the intervention on stress-related symptoms after the war were assessed in telephone interviews with the parents.<br />RESULTS. Study I indicated that, during the war, most children had significant exposure to war-related experiences and had severe stress reactions. The Huggy-Puppy intervention was associated with significant reductions in stress reactions in the postwar assessment. A higher level of attachment and involvement with the doll was associated with better outcomes. The results of study II indicated that group administration of the Huggy-Puppy intervention was associated with significant reductions in stress reactions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Childhood stress and trauma affect kids, and often how it is handled at the time or shortly after is important. Like any trauma, how often it happens, how catastrophic and sometimes life threatening the event appears to be or how intense the reaction is, how it is framed by surrounding trusted adults plays a role in impact on a child.</p>
<p>This is anecdotal and in theater triage, but I think it gives the adults as much structure and focus to help kids and selves as it is the kids responding to the focus and human messages involved. Perspective, feeling protected and protecting, and having someone or thing to take care of is important.</p>
<p>Children who have ptsd can lose their normally easy to find sense of safety and intimacy, and are hyper-sensitive to perceived threat. When they grow up is another story needs telling.</p>

<blockquote><p>I had a close friend here in Milwaukee who got really sick this summer from swimming in the lake while sailing after a dry weather overflow. She had no idea an overflow event had even occurred. This is pretty commonplace, and unfortunately, it&#8217;s really difficult to correlate sewage overflows with illnesses contracted by recreational use, because so few people seek medical attention or make the connection that the water made them sick. There&#8217;s a huge need to study that connection, but the records pretty much don&#8217;t exist.<br />That&#8217;s why the study we [Friends of Milwaukee&#8217;s Rivers and the Emergency Department, Medical College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin] focused on the drinking water connection, which freaked everyone out. It is highly likely that many of the kids in our study could have gotten sick from recreational use as well. We weren&#8217;t able to isolate their exposure, but the hospital is now using questionnaires so we can try to get at that question in the future.</p>
<p>Pediatrics, a peer reviewed medical journal, recently published an article on our study of increased visits to a pediatric emergency room for gastrointestinal illnesses after releases of partially treated, or &#8220;blended&#8221; sewage, here in Milwaukee.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the abstract of the report as it appeared in the journal Pediatrics.</p>

                                <p>I have a lot of theories about what caused the long wave in interest rates. Most center on inflation, but here is another interesting chart to make you think about it.</p>
<p>One of the key relationship is that monetary velocity is inversely related to real interest rates<br />and that has been true for decades &#8212; including the 1930s.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Jim “Mad Money” Cramer gets called out for his optimism on the stock market, denies it, says he was predicting a fall in equities.  Really?  Here’s a recap of a discussion and then some history of Mr. Cramer <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SGkrNJ19DSU">”on video.”</a></p>
<p>However it may not be the stock market that is the last bubble to burst.  The bubble that is little discussed are long term Treasury bond prices, which have been in a long term increase 1982-2008 as long term interest rates have declined.  (Bond prices move inversely with bond interest rates paid, or “yield.”)</p>
<p>As you can see from the chart below, along this rising trend, we’re now testing what they call a “triple top” formation.  This means bond prices peaked in 2003, mid-2005, and are now peaking again in early 2008.  If 30-Year bond prices break upwards out of this pattern, the asset inflation in the bond market continues.  If prices fail, then we may well be at an important ceiling in that asset class. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R5sxwDoR7TI/AAAAAAAAA98/nOxpxUCb0ak/s1600-h/OldVet+30+Year+Treasury+Bond+Price+Index.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R5sxwDoR7TI/AAAAAAAAA98/nOxpxUCb0ak/s320/OldVet+30+Year+Treasury+Bond+Price+Index.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>From here, we can muddle along sideways, or decline in bond prices.  In a world full of credit, and dependent on Treasury demand from foreign and domestic investors, what do you think they will do if upside gains appear to have ended?  They can stick with the lousy interest rates and declining dollar combined with inflation that is now present in the US.  Or they can look elsewhere for long term investments in bonds or other secure instruments that have better prospects and payoffs.</p>
<p>Would you keep buying used cars from a salesman who kept selling you cars that got worse and worse gas mileage?  Or a headhunter who put you in jobs that paid less and less? Maybe we need Mr. Cramer to talk this market up!</p>
