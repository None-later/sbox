<blockquote><a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-12-10-great-lakes-debate_x.htm">The Great Lakes Water Resources Compact</a> was signed last December by the governors of the eight states that border the lakes — Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and New York — and the premiers of the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario. The agreement requires approval of state legislatures before it is sent to Congress for final approval. Ohio&#8217;s Legislature is expected this week to become the first to approve the pact. New York&#8217;s may approve it later this month.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a water grab,&#8221; says Sam Speck, director of the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. &#8220;It&#8217;s a commitment to protect a resource in the face of climate change and other challenges.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Great Lakes contain nine-tenths of the nation&#8217;s fresh water and supply drinking water to 30 million people in Chicago, Toronto, Buffalo and elsewhere. The lakes are an economic engine and the cultural centerpiece for much of the upper Midwest. But the fragile ecology of the lakes has suffered from pollution, invasive species of fish and the diversion of water to support Chicago and other cities.</p>
<p>The new agreement would control who can use the water and how much.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.ouraynews.com/Articles-i-2007-12-19-169065.112113__Grand_water_plan">Grand Water Plan Downstream Pact&#8221;</a> Last week&#8217;s agreement was truly significant, the most important changes since the first compact was drafted in 1922. And the manner in which it came about — no real winners or losers, but a cooperative regional effort to solve problems — was as surprising as it was refreshing.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is truly an historic moment,&#8221; said Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne. &#8220;Celebrate this day. This is huge.&#8221;</p>
<p>The new water deal has four basic elements to manage the water in the Colorado River and its tributaries.</p>
<p>1. The new guidelines establish rules for shortages – specifying who will take reductions and when they take them. This is essential for prudent water planning in times of drought.</p>
<p>2. The new operational rules for Lake Powell and Lake Mead will allow these two massive reservoirs to rise and fall in tandem, thereby better sharing the risk of drought.</p>
<p>3. The new guidelines establish rules for surpluses, so that if the basin is blessed with ample runoff, the Department of the Interior will have rules to distribute the extra water.</p>
<p>4. The new rules will address the ongoing drought by encouraging new initiatives for water conservation.</p>
<p>Previously, the compact divided the states into Upper and Lower Basins, with each to get equal allotments of 7.5 million acre feet per year. But some believe that the 1920s was a wet period, and the allocations were based on an assumption of 16.4 million acre in the basins. Today, the long-term average annual water flow is assumed at 13.5 million acre feet, so it is no surprise that increased demand, because of rampant population growth, had increased interstate tensions. The river provides water to utilities that serve 30 million people. (The eight states in the Southwest water sharing area).</p></blockquote>
<p>I was hoping STR could post on the Great Lakes compact, and the very direct agreement not to ship water out of the current boundaries.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://atrios.blogspot.com/2008_01_06_archive.html#4376492115909414609">Atrios</a>, we learn that <a href="http://www.redstate.com/stories/miscellanea/redstate_has_a_real_need_for_your_help">RedState</a>  is in trouble because its not a liberal blog&#8230; or something.</p>
<blockquote><p>When we started RedState in May of 2004, we used a website program called Scoop — the same program a lot of similar sites on the left used. But, as the number of visitors to our site grew, Scoop kept crashing on us.</p>
<p>If we’d been a liberal website, we would have been able to fix the problem quickly and relatively cheaply.  The online left loves Scoop. Unfortunately, there weren’t really any conservative Scoop developers out there to help us.  We kept crashing and were out of money.  We had to close down or take drastic action.  </p>
<p>Well, we didn’t close down. We ditched Scoop and moved to the best alternative at the time, a program called Drupal.  But, in accomplishing the switch, budget constraints forced us to sacrifice some popular site features in order to alleviate the strain on our overused servers.</p>
<p>Needless to say, we always regarded those “downgrades” as temporary, and we hoped to restore the eliminated features – and to add new and even better ones – as soon as we could afford to.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we still can’t afford to. But we’re convinced that America can afford even less to have us operating at anything less than our absolute peak potential during the coming presidential election season.</p>
<p>So we’ve decided to move ahead with our upgrades without delay, and despite not having the cash on hand – hoping and praying that RedState.com readers like you will help us make up the shortfall with a generous donation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve included more than I needed to so there&#8217;s no suggestion that somehow I&#8217;ve taken this out of context.  Frankly, I blame George W. Bush&#8230; with deeper tax cuts Scoop would have fixed itself.  But in all seriousness&#8230;  as part of the Vast Left Wing Conspiracy, I was wondering &#8211; am I supposed to be getting some freebies of some sort?  </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update&#8230; edited the first and last paragraphs slightly.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update 2&#8230;</p>
<p>In comments, One Salient Oversight notes:<br />
<blockquote>Actually the funny thing is that both Scoop and Drupal are open source software. You&#8217;d think with Redstate&#8217;s love of capitalism that they would&#8217;ve used proprietary software.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nikki points out that the letter sent by Erick from RedState to readers (text at the Atrios link in the post) is actually more damning, beginning with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The bad news: our liberal &#8220;friends&#8221; – you know, the ones who believe so strongly in free speech and open debate – have done what they can to prevent us from making these improvements, so that our influence will be minimized just as we head into the 2008 presidential primary season.</p>
<p>No, our Blue State buddies haven’t succeeded in stopping us from improving our website. But they’ve made it more difficult and more expensive – which is why I’m coming to you for help.</p></blockquote>
<p>Howard sends us to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/comments/2008/1/7/104733/5912/451#c451">Kos</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Want to know the worst of it?</p>
<p>I had offered RedState a technology swap &#8212; they could have all of our improvements if their developer helped with some patches and whanot. I saw this as a way to spread out the costs of improving the platform amongst various sites.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t fit their narrative of being &#8220;censored&#8221; by those crazy liberals.</p>
<p>So in other words, as ludicrous as their charge was &#8212; that they were being censored because no liberals offered to help them &#8212; IT&#8217;S NOT EVEN TRUE!</p>
<p>Aside from that, didn&#8217;t Eagle Publishing buy them? The Regnery folks have a lot of money.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>We&#8217;re starting to see a new campaign by the Republicans about a cut in the corporate tax rates.</p>
<p>There is a good case to be made for corporate tax cuts.  This is especially true if the objective is to increase business fixed investment.  After all corporations account for over 80% of business fixed investment as compared to only about 11% by partnerships, S-corps, etc that are subject to the individual tax code. ( non-profits account for the remainder)  If you want to stimulate capital spending you should give the money to the economic sector that actually does the investments.  But this is also the problem with the  standard supply side argument that cutting taxes at the individual level really does not give you much bang for the buck.</p>
<p>In todays world of international competition there is also the problem of international competition to consider.  For example KPMG did a big study of this last year that is getting a lot of attention. That study had this chart that compared US corporate tax rates to comparable tax rates in other countries.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R4KFeca1zKI/AAAAAAAAAE0/I0PZlnzlcEs/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R4KFeca1zKI/AAAAAAAAAE0/I0PZlnzlcEs/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>You can find the study at:
<p>http://www.kpmg.com/NR/rdonlyres/D8CBA9FF-C953-45FA-940A-FAAC86729554/0/KPMGCorporateTaxRateSurvey.pdf</p>
<p>The study shows that other countries have been lowering rates while the US rate has remained at 40%.  They argue that the US needs to lower corporate rates to offset other countries cutting taxes to below the US rate.</p>
<p>But the problem with this comparison is that the US corporate tax rate is not really 40%.  The<br />effective US corporate tax rate is really only 25%.</p>

<p>My question is why do they have to be so dishonest about it?  There is a valid argument for lower corporate taxes.  Why do they feel they have to publish studies that are so fundamentally biased that if people knew the facts it would undercut their argument.  I guess they have such a low opinion of the business press and other newspaper reporters that they are confident that reporters will never fact check the study.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.epa.gov/epaoswer/non-hw/recycle/recycle.pdf">The Wellesley Dump</a> has expanded even more to date. It is not my town, but is remarkable.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wellesley’s recycling program was started in 1971 by local environmentalists and the Department of Public Works when the town incinerator failed to meet air emission standards. Unlike many of the earlier recycling centers around the nation, Wellesley’s is still in business andis thriving. Located at the town Recycling and Disposal Center, the operation has grown from collecting materials in 55-gallon drums to using 40-cubic-yard, open-top,transfer-haul containers plus a dual ram baler. It is now run by the town public works department and consists of a recycling facility, transfer station, and yard waste composting site.Wellesley has never had municipal curbside garbage collection. Its residents—at least 83% of them—take their refuse to the Recycling and Disposal Facility (RDF),which is free only to residents.</p>
<p>The center is proud of its park and social gathering setting.Picnic tables, well-maintained lawns, trees, flowers, and a circular drive contribute to the site’s popularity for GirlScout cookie sales as well as political events.The center is also unique in its wide acceptance by townspeople and its dedicated staff. Further, the Wellesley recycling center sponsors a recycling education program aimed at all Wellesley residents, including a curriculum for third graders in Wellesley public and private schools.“Recycle. Join the Team” is its theme. The center also actively promotes other recycling in the community. For instance, it helps spread the word about community-sponsored rummage sales.At the recycling center, a wide range of services can be found: a redemption center for bottles donated as asource of revenue for the center, a yard waste composting operation, and Goodwill depots. The book exchange is also a popular gathering place for residents.</p>
<p>Obstacles Overcome: The Wellesley recycling program works, and it has always worked! Nonetheless, there are the complaintsthat recycling takes too much time and that separate storagebins take up too much space in the home. To overcomethese complaints, the center relies on its information and education program. Not only does the public works staff go to the schools, they provide community presentations and promote recycling regularly.</p>
<p>875 pounds of re-cycling material per person for the year was the goal, and 892 pounds was the end of the year measure for 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we know that Annie says for every barrel of stuff we dump as consumers there has been 70 barrels of stuff thrown away in the process of making the stuff.</p>
<p>I assume this does not include the <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2122832/">stuff stored in lockers</a> all over the country and not in use. Every American can stand shoulder to shoulder in the currently constructed storage space, and is one of the fastest growing industries today. This is called stored stuff, and can be read about in the next post.</p>
<p>Then there is the very profitable &#8216;ship your stuff&#8217; to a Chinese labor intensive &#8216;recycle your stuff&#8217; (now considered unAmerican) places to the port of Giyu, China <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2002/02/25/computer-waste.htm">as reported in USA Today</a>. Trash picking at a profitable level, and insures that vessels do not have empty cargo holds on the three part journey of the US-China trade dependency. Reminds me of jolly England of old. And no healthcare costs to worry about, and no WTO to worry about. It is reassuring that no individual rights are violated as none have been established.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Recycling/Problem-With-Plastics5jun03.htm">Plastic containers</a> get turned into new products at a much lower rate than glass bottles or aluminum cans. The can you recycle today, for instance, will make its way back to the supermarket shelf in just six weeks. Because of health concerns, a plastic bottle will never become another plastic bottle. Recyclers often have a hard time making ends meet because the demand from manufacturers for recycled plastic — and, consequently, the money paid for it — is considerably less than for virgin material. Oh-plastics are not considered hazardous material. Currently there is little market for #3 to #7 plastics either.</p>
<p>Wellesley is rightfully proud of its dump. Citizen participation is quite amazing and helps provide the labor for sorting materials to a remarkable degree. Some of the other stories reminds me of how we do not pay for the cheap toasters and such from our major trading ally. More than we know.</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a hedge against water shortages and population growth, Orange County has begun operating the world&#8217;s largest, most modern reclamation plant &#8212; a facility that can turn 70 million gallons of treated sewage into drinking water every day.The new purification system at the Orange County Water District headquarters in Fountain Valley cost about $490 million and comprises a labyrinth of pipes, filters, holding tanks and pumps across 20 acres.<br /><a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-reclaim2jan02_jts86mnc,1,5223619.photo" target="win_34523149"></a><br />Almost four years after construction began, the facility is now purifying effluent from a neighboring sewage treatment plant run by the Orange County Sanitation District, a partner in the venture.The finished product will be injected into the county&#8217;s vast groundwater basin to combat saltwater intrusion and supplement drinking water supplies for 2.3 million people in coastal, central and northern Orange County.But before that can be done, state health officials must certify that the reclaimed water meets drinking water standards. Officials expect the approval to be granted before opening ceremonies Jan. 25.&#8221;Our sources from the delta and the Colorado River are becoming unavailable,&#8221; said Michael R. Markus, general manager of the water district. &#8220;This will help drought-proof the region and give us a locally controlled source of water.&#8221;Last month, for example, a federal judge in Fresno ordered a 30% reduction in fresh water pumped from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta to protect the tiny delta smelt, a threatened species. The region, which is facing myriad environmental problems, is the hub of California&#8217;s water system.If the reclamation plant&#8217;s full potential is realized, officials say, up to 130 million gallons a day could be added to the county&#8217;s fresh water supply, lessening the region&#8217;s dependence on outside sources.Basically, the facility takes treated sewage, which would have been discharged into the sea, and runs it through an advanced filtration system.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Just out of curiosity &#8211; why is the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/03/AR2008010303582.html?hpid=moreheadlines">President considering more economic stimulus</a> at this point?  Let me rephrase the question&#8230;  why is the economy in a state where even rational people are talking about the need for stimulus only a few years after we&#8217;ve had large individual income tax cuts, big cuts on taxes on repatriated corporate income, and continued year after year tax cuts on the estate tax.  And let&#8217;s not forget that the Fed has bent over backward to help GW.  Take a look at real interest rates since GW took office &#8211; has any president gotten anything even remotely resembling this sort of help since stagflation was vanquished?  </p>
<p>So in plain English, we&#8217;ve had a heck of a lot of what we&#8217;re told is fiscal stimulus and a heck of a lot of monetary stimulus since GW took office.  Off the top of my head, the only administration with any comparable combination of tax cutting and help from the Fed was the JFK/LBJ administration&#8230; but JFK/LBJ produced the fastest growth rates of any administration since FDR left office, with an annualized growth rate in real GDP per capita which last time I checked in the middle of last year  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-real-gdp-per.html">more than twice that of GW</a>.  Sure, there were some good quarters last year, but nothing is going to make up that difference in performance.</p>
<p>And yet there&#8217;s still trouble.  This administration (and its cheerleaders) have been wrong about everything they&#8217;ve told us about the economy.  They promised rapid growth and to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">pay down the debt</a>.  In 2007, the surplus was going to be so big that there wouldn&#8217;t be enough retiring bonds to pay off.  By 2010, debt was to be 6.5% of GDP.  That was their first economic plan.</p>
<p>A recession came &#8211; they blamed it on Clinton and 9/11 and pushed through tax cuts, and more tax cuts.  It was a light recession&#8230;  short and shallow.  But apparently enough so that debt would grow rather than shrink, despite all the help from the Fed.  And for some reason, growth was anemic.  So they pushed more tax cuts.  And growth was still anemic. Eventually, in mid &#8211; 2003, the economy started to pick up again.  There was much trumpeting of horns and pontificating and gloating.  We&#8217;ve had average real growth for a few years plus a big run-up in the debt, and now we&#8217;re back to worrying about a downturn again?  Now?  So soon after their wonderful remedy produced what Kudlow called the Goldilocks economy?  </p>
<p>Which raises a question&#8230; what are they going to blame it on now?  Clinton has been out of office too long, its been more than six years since 9/11, Congress has given them just about everything they wanted, and the Fed could not be more cooperative.  (In fact, anyone could see the Fed helped so much for so long, it created its own problem&#8230;  which is where we are at this point.)  So what is left?  Why the very short, very sub-par expansion?   If its not Clinton, and not 9/11, and not the Fed, and not some big problem from abroad, then what?   Random chance?  For no particular reason, this happened now?  Or is it their economy, their policies?</p>
<p>My guess is that they&#8217;ll find some other reason, something other than their own actions and remedies and prescriptions.  Because as far as GW and his cheerleaders are concerned, this situation gives them an excuse to peddle some more of their failed remedies and inane prescriptions.  After what we&#8217;ve seen since January of 2001, a decent man would not go before the American public with a smirk on his face and tell us we need more tax cuts.  But GW will.  And decent people would not see the smirk and hear the call for more of the same and support it.   But the cheerleaders will.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update&#8230; the question came up in comments&#8230;  why the difference in performance between JFK/LBJ and GW if there are similarities.  First, the similarities aren&#8217;t quite that high&#8230; JFK/LBJ didn&#8217;t have anywhere near as much help from the Fed as GW has, and despite their cuts in tax rates, both JFK and LBJ <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/taxes-and-growth-rates-two-graphs.html">increased tax collections as a percentage of income</a>.   Needless to say, GW did some very, very different.</p>
<p>Which leads to these basic differences:</p>
<p>1.  Cutting tax rates has very different effects when tax rates are high than when they are low. <br />2.  My guess is that the tax rate cuts under JFK/LBJ didn&#8217;t benefit one small segment of taxpayers as disproportionately as GW&#8217;s tax rate cuts have done.<br />3.  JFK/LBJ continued to pay down the debt.  Needless to say, GW has done the opposite.<br />4.  JFK/LBJ&#8217;s social policies were designed to broaden the economy by making even the poorest members of society more of a part of it.  <br />5.  JFK/LBJ ushered in the era of the technocrats.  The eggheads descended on Washington and put a lot of time and effort into figuring out what to do.  They weren&#8217;t always right.  And they included folks who were from the other side of the aisle &#8211; C. Douglas Dillon, Secretary of the Treasury from 1961 to 1965, was a Republican.  I don&#8217;t have to mention how this differs from GW&#8217;s administration.</p>

<p>Anyway, you may recall not long ago I had <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/republican-party-and-national-debt.html">a post on the National Debt</a> for <a href="http://facingup.org/blog/scottbittle/2007/12/9-trillion-debt-and-counting-facing-blog-carnival">Facing Up</a>, a blog carnival on the national debt put together by folks from Brookings, the Concord Coalition, the Heritage Foundation, Public Agenda and Viewpoint Learning, together with support from the Ford Foundation, The William and Flora Hewlitt foundation, and the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to name a few.  Some big boys and girls, basically.</p>
<p>Now&#8230;  they&#8217;re soliciting posts on <a href="http://www.facingup.org/node/201/perspectives">Social Security</a> for their next blog carnival.  So if you have a blog and something to say about the topic, now is the time.  And if you have something to say but no blog, let me know&#8230;  perhaps you can guest blog your entry right here.</p>

<p>I hit the daily double with Obama/Edwards the other night, and Huckleberry/Romney on the other side.  My betting friends are going to pay off in wine, happily for the in-laws.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s clearly a great yearning for change in this  country, and we&#8217;re at a watershed moment, which is going to be exacerbated by the recession this year.  Buffpilot may be correct that the &#8220;economy, stupid&#8221; becomes the #1 issue in the race.</p>
<p>Given that even the best politicians like Obama can turn into slippery weasels in a race like this, it&#8217;s still necessary to put unrelenting pressure on the two parties to  start helping the country and its citizens.  How to do so, when you know your Congress critters ignore every word you say?</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an outfit called &#8220;Unity 08&#8221; out there that purports to be a bipartisan effort to elect a &#8220;unity government&#8221; in 2008.  It&#8217;s website is www.Unity08.com.  Maybe it&#8217;s quixotic or even off the mark, since it pinpoints excessive partisanship as the problem in national politics today.  The American Prospect characterizes it thus :</p>
<blockquote><p>Newsweek ran a brief profile of Sam Waterston, Law and Order mainstay, great actor, and all-around lovely guy &#8212; but, unfortunately, also the celebrity spokesman for one of the lamer examples of establishment anti-politics currently around, Unity08.com. All told, the threat to the republic posed by nasty partisanship is about as real as the threat to seniors posed by medicine-hungry robots. </p></blockquote>
<p>Unity08.com has an online &#8220;convention&#8221; in June where you pick a slate of candidates for President and VP.  State organizations can also get the Unity party registered to be on the ballot of that state with enough signatures.  And the platform is chosen by popular demand on the issues.  It&#8217;s free and there&#8217;s not much but a little time to lose.</p>
<p>It may be fruitless, but here&#8217;s a possibility: that Bloomberg and company will fund publicity for Unity, and offer candidates willing to run from both parties.  Then you&#8217;d have a third party movement explode into the limelight, IMHO.  Unity08 is maybe only one tiny vehicle to keep up the pressure but could be more if Bloomberg gets active in financing centrist candidates, if the parties don&#8217;t please voters.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s a better way to keep up the pressure on both parties to be responsive to voters, what is it?  </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

                                <p>For those of you interested in state capitalism, I have been following Huawei&#8217;s interest in 3-Com. Today, that story hit the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/05/AR2008010502608_2.html?hpid=topnews">Washington Post.</a><br />Because 3-Com makes hacker resistent hardware for the U.S. military, the sale of 3-COM to Huawei and Bain Entreprises has raised security concerns in the halls of Congress. While others will raise these legitimate concerns, I am interested in another aspect of this buy-out: the spread of state-capitalism.<br />For starters, note that a two American global investment firms have interest in this sale. The first is clearly Bain Capital; the second is Goldman Sachs, sole advisor to 3-Com.<br />Huawei and 3-Com have been closely connected for some time. 3-Com was attracted to Huawei because of its access to significant cash, its dedicated labor force, and its six-to-one advantage in terms of labor cost, all elements that have attracted companies to China. In fact, only a year ago, 3-Com&#8217;s CEO talked of <a href="http://www.cio.com.au/index.php/id;1131730556;fp;;fpid;;pf;1">acquiring</a> its &#8220;junior&#8221; partner. How things do change. Who is swallowing whom here?<br />What is Huawei? On the surface it seems to be a privately run 16-year old company, owned by one of the wealthiest men in China. But everything may not be as it seems. Consider the following from <a href="http://www.dmf.go.th/events/news.show_news_eng.asp?id=6414"> China Economic Quarterly</a> and appearing also in <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/0a83f662-07b8-11da-a742-00000e2511c8.html?nclick_check=1">Financial Times</a>, an article probing the relationship between Chinese corporations and China itself:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>A third level of state influence is visible in Huawei, a maker of telecoms network equipment. Huawei is ostensibly privately-owned, although many of its shares are owned by the local state telecoms authorities to which it has sold equipment. It enjoys a US$10bn low-interest credit line from the China Development Bank, whose mission is to make concessional loans in support of state policy goals. Huawei’s ties to China’s military have long been the subject of speculation. For the most part, Huawei seems to act independently. Yet, so much about the firm’s parentage is obscure that one can never be entirely sure.<br />The complexity and murkiness of state-corporate relations in China lends a foundation of legitimacy to the political outcry over Chinese takeovers of foreign firms. At one level, this outcry is silly. It could never really hurt developed countries to sell off mid-sized energy companies and floundering appliance makers to Chinese buyers willing to pay rich prices. There is almost certainly an element of racism in protesting sales to Chinese state firms, when similar sales to French state firms would pass unnoticed.<br />But at a deeper level, these objections reflect a simple truth. It is almost impossible to ascertain the extent to which a Chinese state firms is an autonomous actor or an agent of state policy. The Chinese state is controlled by a secretive and authoritarian organisation whose aims are neither clear nor open to scrutiny and debate. When you sell to a Chinese state firm, you ultimately have no idea who you are really selling to. This creates a fair case for raising your asking price, or deciding to sell to a more trustworthy buyer.</p></blockquote>
<p>The racism issue does not interest me, nor do I wish to address the security issue. Others, I am sure, will do both. What I find of interest is the way globalization is proceeding.<br />In the past, global companies, with the help of the World Bank and the IMF, have entered third-world companies, burdened with debt. When the loan was made, one of the conditions was that these countries had to sell their floundering&#8211;and sometimes not so floundering, state owned corporations. Often an ancillliary condition was that the country devalue its currency, which meant pegging it to the dollar. (Do you hear the echo here?) Additionally. many of these countries were brutally dictatorial, Chile under Pinochet, for example. (More echoes?)The reach and power of multinationals was enhanced through the IMF.<br />Additionally, the WTO set the rules for globalization that did not put any restrictions on how a country used or abused its labor force, an additional plum for multinationals.<br />(As an aside, it is no wonder that the IMF now languishes, relegated to being almost a reportorial institution. Third world countries have learned their lesson. Again, it is no wonder that WTO negotiations have stalled. Again, third world countries who care about their people are learning the lesson.)</p>
<p>But along comes China, a repressive dictatorial regime, with more than one-fifth of the world&#8217;s population, a huge, hardworking, labor force with absolutely no protection, centrally controlled. What more could a multinational ask for? Really? Privatization has never blinked before dictatorial regimes; in fact, they rather enjoy them. China was to be the ultimate plum.<br />But deeper than issues of control, what about state-sponsored capitalism? What happens when a country has a gigantic, poor, hard-working labor force and is willing to put that labor force at the disposal of multinationals? Who will eat whom in the end? I suspect that neo-conservative, now gushing over China as the next gigantic prize, will soon learn that China is more than it can swallow. The marriage of 3-Com and Huawei was no accident. China wants to control the internet.<br />3-Com, lured by cheap labor and which, only a year ago, thought it would buy-out Huawei and thereby control the Chinese and world market, may now be swallowed. Who&#8217;s next?<br />Thank you Goldman and Bain for making all this possible. Thanks also to our redoubtable Secretary of State, Henry Paulsen. Thanks also to all those economists who so love free markets and deregulation&#8211;free for corporation but shackling to labor&#8211;that they have made all this possible.</p>
