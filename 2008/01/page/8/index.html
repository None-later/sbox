                                <p>Our friend <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2008/01/fed_cuts_75_bas.html">Bill Polley</a> provided <a href="http://federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm">this link</a> as he rightfully noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the largest rate cut in the modern era in which rate changes have been publicly announced.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bill later noted <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/01/22/news/economy/fed_rates/index.htm?postversion=2008012212">this statement</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This was the biggest rate cut by the Fed since October 1984.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem that the federal funds rate was around 11% at the beginning of October 1984 and was only 10% at the end of the month.  This was the period just before the Reagan-Mondale election when the GOP was singing the tune about “Morning in America”.  While <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/20/reaganomics">Paul Krugman</a> sets the record straight about this 1984 spin, I was wondering how cynical it would have been for the Reagan White House to have pressured the Volcker FED into another round of the political business cycle.  But then – it would not have been like Volcker to yield to such pressure.  And then I recalled that economists were talking about the discount rate and not the federal funds rate as the instrument of monetary policy back then.  And sure enough – we did not see a drop in the discount rate until November 20, 1984 and this drop was only from 9% to 8.5%.</p>

                                <p>While <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/01/emergency-rate.html">Mark Thoma</a> is stuck teaching class today, he links to several pieces on the <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/text-fomc-statement-announcing-rate/story.aspx?guid=%7B1FF7A27C-B888-4B37-92BF-ACB11CCD41E0%7D">75 basis points</a> cut in the federal funds rate:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Open Market Committee has decided to lower its target for the federal funds rate 75 basis points to 3-1/2 percent. The Committee took this action in view of a weakening of the economic outlook and increasing downside risks to growth. While strains in short-term funding markets have eased somewhat, broader financial market conditions have continued to deteriorate and credit has tightened further for some businesses and households. Moreover, incoming information indicates a deepening of the housing contraction as well as some softening in labor markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reactions to the latest from the FED have been very mixed.  <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/01/ben-bernanke-is.html">Brad DeLong</a> brings us the reporting from <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/fed-cuts-rates-75-basis/story.aspx?guid=%7B6D70F269-5B6F-46AE-80D1-C79AEF777BBF%7D">Rex Nutting</a> adding that &#8220;Ben Bernanke Is Earning His Pay”.  <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2008/01/the-bernanke-pu.html">Willem Buiter</a> does not appear to be happy with this move calling the move “excessive and smells of fear”.  <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/01/22/bernanke-hits-the-panic-button">Felix Salmon</a> echoes the concerns of Buiter:</p>
<blockquote><p>There&#8217;s nothing in there to justify a huge rate cut in the week before a regularly-scheduled meeting. Tighter credit for some households? Come on. There&#8217;s one reason and one reason only that the Fed took this move, and it&#8217;s the plunge in global stock markets on Monday, along with indications that the US markets were set to follow suit.  Now the Fed is charged with keeping employment high and inflation low; it&#8217;s not charged with protecting the capital of investors in the stock market. So this action smells a bit like panic to me, and it might also have prevented the kind of stomach-lurching selling which could conceivably have marked a market bottom. I have to say I don&#8217;t like it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/01/the_fed_makes_i.html">James Hamilton</a> offers a view that differs substantially from that of Buiter and Salmon:</p>
<blockquote><p>I doubt very much that anyone on the FOMC has much interest in protecting the investments of stock market participants. Instead, I suspect that the Fed is using equity prices just as I and many other economic analysts do, namely, as a useful aggregator of private and public information about near-term prospects for economic growth. All the recent indicators have suggested a significant deterioration of real economic activity over the last two months. I take the global stock market sell-off as one more confirmation of that assessment, and new information about the global scope of the problems we face.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the views from the professionals may differ, there is no doubt that <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/01/comic-relief.html">The Sandwichman</a> was being too kind when he called <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/expert/article/yourlife/62337">Ben Stein</a> a doofus.  My Econospeak colleague is upset that Ben Stein said recessions are not all bad with this quote taking the cake:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those who tend to their work, who get to the office or showroom or shop early, stay late, work hard, stay on the phones dialing for deals (as my pal, Barron Thomas, puts it), will make money. Those who stay sharp and make a point of befriending their clients will make money. Yes, some extra effort will be needed, but it&#8217;ll pay off. There&#8217;s still money to be made, even when the economy itself has slowed down. It&#8217;s the guy or gal who puts in extra effort who stays ahead and even prospers when the economy is in a slowdown. The easygoing, laid-back time-servers get tossed overboard.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Mr. Stein thinks that the only reason why the average workweek is pro-cyclical is that most folks become lazy bastards during a recession.  But the title of this post had to do with this quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>This slowdown is happening faster and harder than I thought it would. I was too optimistic. My optimism was based on a belief that the Federal Reserve would act more aggressively than it has in fighting the slowdown. It didn&#8217;t, and we&#8217;re paying the price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stein wants us to believe that he (as an “economist”) that he knew that the FED needed to act sooner and faster.  But of course, Mr. Stein  (who only plays an economist on TV or whatever) was calling for FED moderation and didn’t bother to criticize Ben Bernanke for not cutting interest rates sooner until well after the FED had already reduced interest rates a bit.  There will be a lot of smart reactions if not disagreements among the professionals about today’s move, but I think we’ve already endured the dumbest reaction.  Let’s just hope no one tops Ben Stein on this one!</p>

<p>
<blockquote>At this point in the research, though, it&#8217;s too early to tell how well beta blockers might work even as a therapeutic aid, Altemus said.</p>
<p>&#8220;There were two small studies that have already been done using propranolol for PTSD, where they treated people right when the accident happened &#8212; they found people in the emergency room. One study was done in France, and one was done in Boston,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They did find they were able to reduce the [emotional] intensity of traumatic memories by giving people propranolol for the first 10 days or so after an accident.&#8221;<br />But Altemus also pointed out that PTSD is rather rare, with less than 10 percent of accident victims experiencing the recurrent flashbacks, isolation and avoidant behaviors that are hallmarks of the condition. So, it wouldn&#8217;t make sense to hand out propranolol to everyone who&#8217;d suffered a traumatic event, she said.<br />&#8230;<br />According to the Associated Press, a study released Thursday by the US Army surgeon general&#8217;s office estimates that between 4 percent and 5 percent of returning Iraqi veterans with combat experience suffer from PTSD.<br />Funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, Altemus is currently working to recruit PTSD patients for a large-scale trial of propranolol &#8212; a tough job when effective interventions such as exposure therapy already exist. She said that as soon as she&#8217;s able to recruit the 60 people needed for the trial, results should be available within a year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dr. Altemus since September has obtained one subject a month by report. </p></div>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Can you do economics on a t-shirt?  I&#8217;ve decided to find out.  As regular readers know, together with a co-author I&#8217;ve been working on a book looking at how economic issues (e.g., real gdp per capita, the national debt) and social issues (e.g., abortions, education spending) evolved from Ike&#8217;s term to the present.  We use a lot of graphs (some of them similar to those that have appeared in some Angry Bear posts) and try very hard to stick to just what the data tells us.</p>
<p>Because the book is a bit different from anything we&#8217;ve seen, we want to market the book in a way that is a bit different from the way books are marketed&#8230; and perhaps make a bit of money (which we might need in order to self-publish if we don&#8217;t find a publisher).  We also want to do some good by informing people of important facts in a simple, concise way.  So&#8230;  the Ex-GF and one of our neighbors (a graphic artist) have put a little scheme in motion for us.  They set up an on-line store at Cafe Press selling t-shirts and other products with some graphs from the book, and also a website for the book.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re launching with three designs, and will be adding more of them over the next few weeks.  Two of the designs will gladden the hearts of most people who lean Democratic (growth in real GDP per capita, percent of time spent in recession &#8211; I suspect we&#8217;ll have to update Mr. GW&#8217;s figures soon&#8230;), and one will do the same for those who lean Republican (change in the tax bite).  Most of the graphs from the book are not ideal for a t-shirt; for a t-shirt one has to be contentious, which in effect means showing one party outperforming the other.  </p>
<p>And this raises an issue &#8211; our goal was to cover as many important issues as possible (i.e., for which we could find data) and to be as unbiased as possible.  (My co-author has been especially diligent at scrubbing any bias out my writing.)  But, as Stephen Colbert noted, the facts have a liberal bias.  There do seem to be a lot more graphs that show Dems doing well than graphs that show Reps doing well.  Which means there will be a lot more shirt designs showing Dems doing well than there are shirt designs showing Reps doing well.   I guess that&#8217;s a lesson in and of itself&#8230; even attempting to be as unbiased as possible, there does seem to be a difference between the two parties.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re also trying something that may be a bit odd for a t-shirt&#8230;  we&#8217;re not making the designs so wide that they are self-explanatory from a distance.  Our goal is to stimulate debate&#8230; force people to read the thing from relatively close up, which may force them to ask a question or two the person wearing the t-shirt.</p>
<p>At our website, we also provide explanations about each design.  Additional, we use <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=writely&#038;passive=true&#038;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2F&#038;followup=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2F&#038;ltmpl=homepage&#038;nui=1">Google Docs</a> to put up a spreadsheet that shows the data we used and the calculations that went into each design, together with a step by step description where appropriate; we&#8217;re a big fan of &#8220;try this at home, kids.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Anyway, I do a bit more of a sales pitch at our <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/prezper">Cafe Press store</a> and our book&#8217;s site, <a href="http://www.presidentialperformance.com/">PresidentialPerformance.com</a>.<br />Anyway, we&#8217;re grateful not only for any purchases, but also for suggestions and comments.  That includes suggestions and comments on changes to the design or website, what else we should put, and how to go about marketing these t-shirts and the book.  </p>
<p>Thanks a bunch.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a picture of one.  Unfortunately, I can&#8217;t get it to zoom here so the t-shirt is not entirely readable.  But you can get it to zoom at the Cafe Press site.</p>

                                <p>Here&#8217;s <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/01/suckers_for_a_good_story.php">Megan McArdle</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the comments to the previous post, Brooksfoe, who I respect a great deal, points out that the narrative &#8220;Soldiers exposed to combat come home to kill&#8221; does not flunk the gut check test.</p>
<p>No, indeed, it doesn&#8217;t. I can build a quite plausible story where combat makes people into crazy killers.</p>
<p>The problem is, it&#8217;s just a story. History is full of those stories that turned out not to be true. As my commenter points out, I can also build a plausible story where combat makes you realize the sanctity of human life and makes you less likely to kill. Or where the amazing human capacity for compartmentalization makes it have no overall effect. A look at one piece of gross evidence&#8211;the massive return of combat troops post World War II does not seem to show <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">evidence of a killing spree</a>; homicide rates fall during the war (not surprising; we shipped our prime homicide age overseas by the millions, plus national emergencies tend to surpress both crime and suicide); rates return to their 1940 level in 1946, then fall rapidly, which is not what I would expect if combat is really so brutalizing. But lots of things changed, yadda yadda. The point is, there is usually more than one plausible story. To check whether your story is true, you need data.</p></blockquote>
<p>She&#8217;s right&#8230; you need data.  But it helps to have some idea how to look at data when you have it.  See, this story seems pretty plausible to me.  The drop-off after 1946 she finds so puzzling to me indicates not a problem, but adds to the plausibility of the story.  After all, combat is traumatic, but I would imagine, like most traumas, for most people it fades with time.  It may never go away, but for most people the pressing effect of it is going to be felt most deeply in the year or so after combat ends, not thirty years later.</p>
<p>Now, I like data, and I like testing things, so I figured&#8230; let&#8217;s see what I could do in a few minutes to test both whether demobilized troops returning from combat can raise the murder rate, and my little hypothesis that this is likely a short term (one year or so) effect.  So I decided to check out the data to which she links&#8230; and which, when you follow the links, comes originally from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_homicide_rate">this table at the Justice Dep&#8217;t</a>. </p>
<p>Well, if we have data, we can build a model.  I&#8217;m going to build a very simple model, looking at how the change in the murder rate from one year to the next is affected by troops coming home, and the population in the prime homicide age (which I assume is males 18 &#8211; 25).  The data on population through 1979 comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/pre-1980/PE-11.html">here</a> and the data on population after that comes from <a href="http://www.census.gov/compendia/statab/tables/07s0011.xls">here</a>.  (This is data I pulled a couple of months ago&#8230; the second link doesn&#8217;t seem to be active right now.  Sorry about that.  Makes me really hope I didn&#8217;t screw up the data since it makes hard to check it!)  Since the pre-1979 is such a pain in the butt to put together, I&#8217;m only going to go back to 1940.  (I&#8217;m curious, but I&#8217;m not that curious, and this is just a hobby and I only have a bit of time.  Someone give me a grant or some money and I&#8217;ll do something a lot more rigorous.)  I also construct a dummy variable that is equal to zero in most years, and is equal to 1 in the year of a demobilization of combat troops, in the year after a demobilization of combat troops, and in the year after that.   </p>
<p>So here are the years for which the dummy is not equal to zero:<br />&#8211; I assumed that for WW2, there wasn&#8217;t much of a demobilization until 1945&#8230; so the dummy is equal to 1 for 1945 through 1946.<br />&#8211; Similarly, I assumed three wasn&#8217;t much of a demobilization for the Korean War until 1953, so the dummy is equal to 1 for 1953 through 1954.<br />&#8211; For Vietnam, it seems combat troops were in and out, usually after a year of combat&#8230;  I assumed there wasn&#8217;t much of an American presence there until 1964 &#8211; so there wouldn&#8217;t be any major demobilizations until 1965.  I also assumed most US combat troops were out by 1973&#8230;  so the dummy is equal to 1 from 1964 to 1974. <br />&#8211; For Gulf War 1 &#8211; the War ended in 1991, and the dummy was set to 1 for 1991 &#8211; 1992. <br />&#8211; The Justice Dep&#8217;t data to which McArdle indirectly linked ends in 2002&#8230; I assume there were some troops returning from Afghanistan then, so 2002 is set to 1. <br />&#8211; Other wars&#8230; Grenada, Panama, Kosovo, etc., I figured were too small for many soldiers to have suffered the effects of shell-shock or other events that lead to excessive trauma.</p>
<p>The dummy is quick and dirty&#8230; if I had the time, maybe I&#8217;d try to figure out how many troops were coming home (or what percent of the population it amounted to) and multiply that by the dummy.  But like I said, this is just a hobby and I&#8217;m doing this at speed.</p>
<p>A quick note to other data jockeys reading this&#8230;  the correlation between the change in the murder rate and its lag is about 0.37.  I&#8217;d prefer lower, but its low enough that I&#8217;m willing to assume not enough autocorrelation to be a problem in a very quick and extremely dirty analysis.   Differencing the dependent variable means I don&#8217;t think I don&#8217;t have to worry about  unit root issues. </p>
<p>Anyway, I&#8217;ve put up a file that has the data, and the regression results <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILgG5gCFVdEWOQ">here</a>.  (Congrats to me for finally figuring out how to use <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/ServiceLogin?service=writely&#038;passive=true&#038;continue=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2F&#038;followup=http%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2F&#038;ltmpl=homepage&#038;nui=1">Google Docs!!!</a>)</p>
<p>A summary&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  The model has an adjusted R2 is only 0.11.  Not great, but bear in mind&#8230; its explaining the variation in the change in the murder rate, not the murder rate itself, which is much harder to do.  So for its purposes, and given its a quick and dirty model, I&#8217;m not complaining too much.  Sure, there&#8217;s a lot of room for improvement.  So what?<br />2.  Males 18 &#8211; 24 as a % of the population has a positive sign&#8230; but is not significant &#8211; the p-value is .36<br />3.  The demobilization dummy is positive&#8230; and has a P-value of 0.004.  Put another way, the model does seem to indicate that within 1 years of soldiers coming home from combat, there is an uptick in the murder rate, and its significant, even at an alpha of 1%.  (Back to the numbers nerds for a moment &#8211; even my assumption of autocorrelation was generous, autocorrelation will raise the t Stat, but I wouldn&#8217;t be on it taking a variable that isn&#8217;t significant and giving it this kind of a P-value if there isn&#8217;t something to it given how long the t to t+1 correlation was.) </p>
<p>This is not to speak ill of soldiers.  Most of them do not come home and commit murder.  And those that do&#8230; are probably not entirely themselves.  Combat does things to people.  So any failure these numbers might suggest belong exclusively to three parties:</p>
<p>1.  The DoD for not doing enough to help these people who gave so much<br />2.  The politicians for not doing something about it<br />3.  Us for not making our politicians do something about.  Slapping a yellow ribbon magnet on your car doesn&#8217;t do diddly, quite frankly. </p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s my quick and dirty model.  Have at it.</p>

                                <p>Sammy sent me the following&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Title:  Effect of a tax cut on a Simple Economy</p>
<p>There is constant debate on the effects of tax cuts and government spending on economic output.  The analysis consists of examining historical data to discover correlations, but both sides come to opposite conclusions because of time lags, measurement problems, and most importantly, <em>the effect of exogenous variables</em>.</p>
<p>So what if we were to construct a model that <em>excludes as many of these variables as possible so as to isolate the effect of tax cuts and government spending</em> on a hypothetical economy.</p>
<p>Imagine a simple economy where economic output is measured in bushels of wheat (as a proxy for GDP).</p>
<p>Other conditions:</p>
<p>     1)  100 workers produce 10 bushels of wheat each for a total of 1,000 bushels per year.</p>
<p>     2)  Production of wheat remains directly proportionate to the labor input.</p>
<p>     3)  All group support functions ie medical, organizational etc are in stasis to support those 100 workers.</p>
<p>Now, to simulate the effect of government/taxes imagine 30 of those workers are diverted by government to some other function &#8211; digging holes and filling them up, &#8220;R&#038;D&#8221;, whatever those huge buildings full of government workers do,  anything except producing wheat.</p>
<p>Since condition 2) above holds, output of this economy measured by bushels of wheat is now 700, not 1,000.</p>
<p>Now one may debate, as liberals will, that those 30 diverted workers produce some other meaningful benefit, but they cannot refute that output, measured by bushels of wheat, declines.</p>
<p>This is what tax cuts (dollars are productive labor in physical form) and reductions in government do.  <em>They return more labor/resources to the production of wheat.</em></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This was by Sammy.  Cactus here &#8211; Sammy is right, but I think I can provide the liberal response:</p>
<p>If everyone is doing the wheat farming, nobody is building the road that allows the the farmers to get wheat to market.  If the government taxes each farmer by requiring X number of days of their labor to build roads, the output of wheat will go down in the short run.  But it will also allow the farmers to sell the wheat, and to purchase equipment which otherwise would never make it to their farms, meaning that it increases the output of wheat next year by a lot.  </p>
<p>And this process is true each year &#8211; each year, the government &#8220;tax&#8221; reduces output below the level it otherwise could be that year, but each year it raises the maximum possible output by producing infrastructure and other things needed to keep the economy going.  Each year the output rises&#8230; more than it would if there hadn&#8217;t been taxes the year before or the year before that.  </p>
<p>And one more thing about this story&#8230; from here to eternity, most of the farmers are going to complain about the government.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. sought to forge the common ground on which people from all walks of life could join together to address important community issues. On January 21st, 2008, millions of Americans across the country will once again honor his legacy by taking part in a wide range of service projects—conducting food drives, painting schools and community centers, recruiting mentors for needy youth, and bringing meals to homebound neighbors, to name but a few.</p>
<p>In recognition of the 40th anniversary of Dr. King’s assassination, the Corporation for National and Community Service in 2008 is also pleased to join with other organizations in supporting a new initiative, “40 Days of Nonviolence: Building the Beloved Community.” Under this initiative, the King Day of Service will kick off 40 days during which families, schools, faith communities, and other organizations will plan service projects and educational activities promoting Dr. King’s message of nonviolence and social justice.</p></blockquote>

The US experienced a very large surge in real retail sales that were<br />not adequately explained by the usual factors.  ( see the jump above the arrow in the chart)</p>
<p>This looks a lot more convincing to me about the impact of the stimulous then some survey asking people to remember how they spent the money.  This is especially true when the biggest use of the rebate was to pay off debt, and this free up resources that would have been used for debt servicing to spend on other things. The retail sales data implies that is what happened.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www6.comcast.net/news/articles/general/2008/01/19/Homeless.on.the.Homefront/">This article</a> found on comcast.net from AP describes a growing problem.</p>
<blockquote><p>For as long as the United States has sent its young men &#8211; and later its young women &#8211; off to war, it has watched as a segment of them come home and lose the battle with their own memories, their own scars, and wind up without homes.<br />The Civil War produced thousands of wandering veterans. Frequently addicted to morphine, they were known as &#8220;tramps,&#8221; searching for jobs and, in many cases, literally still tending their wounds.<br />More than a decade after the end of World War I, the &#8220;Bonus Army&#8221; descended on Washington &#8211; demanding immediate payment on benefits that had been promised to them, but payable years later &#8211; and were routed by the U.S. military.<br />And, most publicly and perhaps most painfully, there was Vietnam: Tens of thousands of war-weary veterans, infamously rejected or forgotten by many of their own fellow citizens.<br />Now it is happening again, in small but growing numbers.<br />For now, about 1,500 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan have been identified by the Department of Veterans Affairs. About 400 of them have taken part in VA programs designed to target homelessness.<br />The 1,500 are a small, young segment of an estimated 336,000 veterans in the United States who were homeless at some point in 2006, the most recent year for which statistics are available, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness.<br />Still, advocates for homeless veterans use words like &#8220;surge&#8221; and &#8220;onslaught&#8221; and even &#8220;tsunami&#8221; to describe what could happen in the coming years, as both wars continue and thousands of veterans struggle with post-traumatic stress.<br />People who have studied postwar trauma say there is always a lengthy gap between coming home &#8211; the time of parades and backslaps and &#8220;The Boys Are Back in Town&#8221; on the local FM station &#8211; and the moments of utter darkness that leave some of them homeless.<br />In that time, usually a period of years, some veterans focus on the horrors they saw on the battlefield, or the friends they lost, or why on earth they themselves deserved to come home at all. They self-medicate, develop addictions, spiral down.<br />How &#8211; or perhaps the better question is why &#8211; is this happening again?<br />&#8220;I really wish I could answer that question,&#8221; says Anthony Belcher, an outreach supervisor at New Directions, which conducts monthly sweeps of Skid Row in Los Angeles, identifying homeless veterans and trying to help them get over addictions.<br />&#8220;It&#8217;s the same question I&#8217;ve been asking myself and everyone around me. I&#8217;m like, wait, wait, hold it, we did this before. I don&#8217;t know how our society can allow this to happen again.&#8221;<br />___<br />Mental illness, financial troubles and difficulty in finding affordable housing are generally accepted as the three primary causes of homelessness among veterans, and in the case of Iraq and Afghanistan, the first has raised particular concern.<br />Iraq veterans are less likely to have substance abuse problems but more likely to suffer mental illness, particularly post-traumatic stress, according to the Veterans Administration. And that stress by itself can trigger substance abuse.<br />Some advocates say there are also some factors particular to the Iraq war, like multiple deployments and the proliferation of improvised explosive devices, that could be pulling an early trigger on stress disorders that can lead to homelessness.<br />While many Vietnam veterans began showing manifestations of stress disorders roughly 10 years after returning from the front, Iraq and Afghanistan veterans have shown the signs much earlier.<br />That could also be because stress disorders are much better understood now than they were a generation ago, advocates say.<br />&#8220;There&#8217;s something about going back, and a third and a fourth time, that really aggravates that level of stress,&#8221; said Michael Blecker, executive director of Swords to Plowshares,&#8221; a San Francisco homeless-vet outreach program.<br />&#8220;And being in a situation where you have these IEDs, everywhere&#8217;s a combat zone. There&#8217;s no really safe zone there. I think that all is just a stew for post-traumatic stress disorder.&#8221;<br />Others point to something more difficult to define, something about American culture that &#8211; while celebrating and honoring troops in a very real way upon their homecoming &#8211; ultimately forgets them.<br />This is not necessarily due to deliberate negligence. Perhaps because of the lingering memory of Vietnam, when troops returned from an unpopular war to face open hostility, many Americans have taken care to express support for the troops even as they solidly disapprove of the war in Iraq.<br />But it remains easy for veterans home from Iraq for several years, and teetering on the edge of losing a job or home, to slip into the shadows. And as their troubles mount, they often feel increasingly alienated from friends and family members.<br />&#8220;War changes people,&#8221; says John Driscoll, vice president for operations and programs at the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans. &#8220;Your trust in people is strained. You&#8217;ve been separated from loved ones and friends. The camaraderie between troops is very extreme, and now you feel vulnerable.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/ptsd-meta-analysis.html">The meta-analysis on PTSD 2008</a> had one conclusion that there was a paucity of studies done with veterans. One could argue this to some degree, but let me say there have been few studies funded by NIH and the VA that had enough money to be thorough for combat ptsd. More had been done for children, but the false memory people are still being well paid despite losing court battles.</p>
<p>PTSD itself had no publication devoted to it until 1985, so of course the ins and outs of what it is are in its infancy (concerning clinical studies). On the other hand, we know some very basic human needs are involved from a long historical experiment.</p>
