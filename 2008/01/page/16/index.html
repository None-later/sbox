<p>Voter ID requirement laws shall likely be relevant to the 2008 election  and discussion is often very heated about the relevant issues.  I decided to write up my thoughts as to the relevant issues upon which I think people on either side of the debate could agree.  (This means I am explicitly excepting any discussion of race and the voting rights act from my post)</p>
<p>As I see it, there are two basic principled and simple stands to be taken as relates to who may vote:</p>
<blockquote><p>(1) Every person who has a legal right to vote should be able to vote.  (The system should respect the individual&#8217;s right to vote)  No person should be illegally disenfranchised (his/her vote suppressed).</p>
<p>(2) Every person who has no legal right to vote should not be able to vote (No individual should be allowed to vote without that right)  No person should commit (additive) vote fraud or cause (additive) vote fraud to be committed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Disenfranchisement occurs when a voter&#8217;s vote is not counted.  This can occur legally in some states, in some cases.  A felon who has been purged from the voting rolls in a state prohibiting felons from voting, for example, is legally disenfranchised.  A felon who has served time and petitioned to regain their voting rights, had that petition granted, but who is still denied the right to vote, however, would be illegally disenfranchised.  The system would, in that case, have denied a legitimate voter the right to vote.  A non-felon confused with a felon (perhaps due to having the same name) and denied the vote would also be illegally disenfranchised.</p>
<p>Vote suppression can occur in systemic manners as well.  If a particular polling facility has insufficient resources and lines form, causing voters to give up their chance to vote due to pressing obligations (a job they cannot afford to lose), voters can have their votes effectively suppressed.  If a polling location is particularly inconvenient to the populace, requiring a long trek via public transit across town, this could also suppress votes by depressing turnout.  If voters were misdirected by mailings, calls, or individuals giving erroneous information as to polling locations, this interference (illegal as far as I know) with the election process could disenfranchise.  If voters were intimidated into giving up on voting or traveling to a polling place, this would also amount to disenfranchisement.</p>
<p>Fraud can be perpetrated by both individuals voting and voting officials.  Chicago in 1960 was widely believed to have notably altered election outcomes due to fraudulent voting, and is associated with the phrase, &#8220;Vote early, vote often.&#8221;  Multiple votes cast by the same individual fraudulently on behalf of others clearly constitute fraud.  An individual masquerading as another and stealing their vote (though risky, if the true individual also tries to vote) would constitute fraud.  Election officials tampering with physical ballots to add or remove votes would be committing fraud at a low level.  This fraud might not even be evident in a recount.  Elections officials tampering to alter vote tallies would also be committing fraud.  And any rigging of technology to alter outcomes, whether by a voting official, a voter, or a third party, would definitely constitute vote fraud.</p>
<p>Given these various concerns about disenfranchisement and fraud, various solutions have been proposed.  To address the potential for individuals to perpetrate additive vote fraud, requirements of identity documentation at the time of voting have been proposed.  ID requirements would enforce matching of identity against some centralized records.  Voters using such ID would in most cases be validated as legitimate.  (Perhaps a son could pretend to be his father, if they had the same name and the election official wasn&#8217;t aware or paying close attention.)  By and large, such a system would enforce principle (2) as above.  Any individual entitled to vote under law who for some reason didn&#8217;t hold a valid ID would, however, find him/herself<br /> unable to vote.  (If a state driver&#8217;s license were the required ID and that license had been confiscated due to a traffic infraction, for example.)  Restrictions on cost, accessibility and type of ID acceptable would also serve to restrict the pool of voters allowed to actually vote.  Thus there is a potential for this sort of system to run contrary to principle (1) in some cases.</p>
<p>No complex system, especially one involving humans, is foolproof or perfect.  There is always a possibility of fraud and disenfranchisement.  The questions each reasonable person has tend to pertain to prioritization of these problems, and the best solutions to each problem.  The best solutions must also take into account any side-effects, externalities or other unexpected consequences.  The best solutions, as well, must be faithful to the above principles as well as effective.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve left my own opinions out of this post as best I can, trying to document everything I can recall or think of which is relevant to voter ID issues.  I tend to think that, as a general rule, prioritization of problems comes from analysis of the data to determine prevalence and severity.  Without saying what I think the data has shown, I&#8217;ll leave that up for discussion.  (PLEASE NOTE:  I said data and not anecdotes, but I&#8217;m sure anecdotes will be the first thing and most vehement examples cited)</p>
<p>Separately, I wrote notes up for a post on voting systems, which I can write up in the future if there is interest.  It&#8217;s hopefully similarly dispassionate, as I do have a list of relevant issues, principles, and pros and cons for proposed and implemented solutions.</p>

<p>”Riding the credit wave or crushed by its power?”</p>
<p>A few days ago, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/why-is-economy-in-trouble-seriously-why.html">Cactus asked why the economy is in trouble</a>.  He noted the huge amounts of fiscal and monetary stimulus since GW took office have only produced average amounts of real growth, and then only for a few years.</p>
<p>Continuing on a theme broached by Cactus, it is very likely that we are at a moment of excess and correction in the US real economy which is caused by what I have termed the “financial economy” in some previous posts.  Some well-respected economists like Nouriel Roubini are forecasting a pessimistic ending, but not an apocalypse, to this episode.  I’m pessimistic in the short and medium term as well, but believe that unwinding the US credit excesses and setting more realistic premiums for risk in financial assets will solve this gloomy period ahead.</p>
<p>(I note that several readers of Angry Bear have a different view on the origins of the present economic problem such as a real world overproduction crisis or other theories which seek to explain what is happening.)</p>
<p>BCA Research, a Canadian investment research outfit founded in 1949, posits a dark ultimate outcome but a more rosy short term prospect for the US.  The think we’ve reached <a href="http://www.beearly.com/pdfFiles/BCAsep07_05sr.pdf">“An Inflection Point in the Debt Supercycle”</a>.</p>
<p>BCA believes that large scale Fed intervention combined with continued foreign investment in US assets will simply set off another leg of the asset bubbles we’ve been seeing, which will last through this decade.</p>
<blockquote><p>”For some time, we have stated that emerging markets and resources were our favored candidates to benefit from a final mania blow-off in the closing years of this decade. This still seems a good bet.  One implication is that the dollar would drop further. . .&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>After that, at some point, BCA speculates that a deeper correction in credit markets will take place with more severe consequences.  But deeply entrenched financial institutions depend on asset prices and growing asset prices means growing financial institutional profits.  BCA is predicting that champagne will continue to be the mouthwash of financial moguls for the immediate future.  Status loves its quo, after all.</p>

                                <p>For those of us concerned about dwindling resources, Leanan over at <a href="http://www.theoildrum.com/node/3483#more">The Oil Drum</a> includes in his weekly roundup of news a Matt Simmons <a href="http://www.simmonsco-intl.com/files/Another%20Nail%20in%20the%20Coffin.pdf">article</a>.</p>
<p>In an email exchange, a friend of mine ask me to comment on Stratfor&#8217;s <a href="http://www.stratfor.com/podcast/oil_fall_year">prediction</a>. At first, I merely brushed Stratfor&#8217;s predictions off. After all, in 2005 it predicted $30 oil&#8211;and deep trouble for China.</p>
<p>Well, prices have continued to climb&#8211;and China is the world&#8217;s boom-town.<br />Simmons makes the case against Stratfor, putting the arguments succinctly:
<ol>
<li>Oil production has not exceeded that of May 2005.</li>
<li>Energy demand is increasing. The boom town must be fed.</li>
<li>Natural gas will not meet rising energy needs.</li>
<li>Bio-fuels, synthetic oils, etc are, at best, stop-gap measures.</li>
</ol>
<p>What is left is the slow liquidation of present oil stocks, the size of which we simply do not know. Simmons discussion of this issue is well worth reading.</p>
<p>In short, we may be ignoring the obvious if we base our production predictions on simply geo-political events.</p>
<p>As far as the Canadian oil sands is concerned, that tap will not be large enough to supply increasing demand.</p>
<p>And what about the shale oil reserves in Wyoming, Colorado, and Utah? They are vast. Jim Hamilton at Econobrowser provided a good <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/09/oil_shale_retor.html">overview</a> of the problems with shale.</p>
<p>What about the argument that there is plenty of oil yet to be discovered? It is hard to argue a negative, i.e., that there are no more great deposits. Geologists know the rock formations that hide oil. Certainly, if there were other great deposits,  they would now know where to look.</p>
<p>For the sake of argument, let us suppose there are great, undiscovered deposits. Can they be tapped quickly enough to meet rising needs? I think not. The lead time to developing a field is too long.</p>
<p>What about demand destruction? After all, oil is now within reach of the real cost of oil during the 1970&#8217;s crisis. Certainly there will be demand destruction if the price continues its slow climb. But what will be the economic aftershocks of such a continued climb? Think here of not only of the U.S. but of the world.</p>
<p>Will coal make up the difference?&#8211;after all coal-burning plants are being constructed weekly. Who wants them? We are still some distance from &#8220;clean&#8221; coal. Already, we filling the air with CO2 and other pollutants. Want to join the Chinese in wearing gas masks to work, as you peddle or walk through the fumes? Climate change and pollution proceeds apace, even as we struggle with our energy needs and an <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/">economic crisis</a> that grows more certain every day.</p>
<p>We seem to be approaching the proverbial perfect storm: Growing energy needs, questionable energy stop-gaps, rising alarm about pollution and climate change, and a growing crisis in trust among financial instutitions. How many of these balls can we keep in the air at one time? We could, of course, toss in a number of other balls, which occasionally gain attention now and then: Potable water, for example. Water tables are dropping. Poyang, China&#8217;s largest fresh water lake, and the Great Lakes themselves are poised to hit all-time lows. And what about bio-diversity?</p>
<p>It is important to see all these issues as interconnected. Economists look and argue about their slice of the world: Climatologists, theirs&#8230;.and so on round the table. Those who argue the world is unchanging and safe, keep their foot on the brake. And so, we stall and stutter forwards and backwards.</p>
<p>At some in the near future, worried experts everywhere should join forces and expertize, insisting that we address these issues as they should be addressed: Interconneted.<br /><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2005/09/oil_shale_retor.html"></a></p>

<p>The sudden collapse of the Hillary campaign has been breathtaking.</p>
<p>How much is due to &#8220;style&#8221;?  Check out this <a href="http://election.newsmax.com/clinton_change/?s=al&#038;promo_code=4270-1">video</a> of Hillary in the Democratic debate.</p>
<p>It is a visceral turnoff to everyone I have shown it to.  Does it really reveal anything significant about the candidate?  Are so used to hearing words lie to us, so we look at other things such as body language and tone of voice?  Is sexism involved? </p>
<p>Is &#8220;style&#8221; truly important?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This one was by Sammy.  </p>
<p>I want to expand on the issue Sammy raises.  Clearly, Hillary Clinton doesn&#8217;t have the&#8230; well, call it style or charisma that Obama does.  Nor does she speak the way he does.  Whether you are on the right on or left, I think its difficult to argue that the most charismatic candidate, and the best speaker, is Obama.</p>
<p>And when you look at American presidents, not surprisingly, many of them have been cut from a similar mold.  Of the Presidents we&#8217;ve had since Ike left office, JFK and Reagan were clearly very likable, excellent speakers.  I think Bill Clinton fit that mold as well.  And the economy grew rapidly under all three.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also had some, well, less-likable presidents:  LBJ, Nixon, and Poppy Bush.  LBJ  had very rapid growth and accomplished a lot (whether or not you like what he accomplished)&#8230; Nixon and Poppy, not so much.   </p>
<p>Leaving aside Obama and Hillary and the rest of the candidates&#8230;  how important is the ability to inspire for the country?   Does it always matter?  And how much does it transcend knowing what one is doing?  (If we were to put together an equation, how much weight do we give to knowledge, competence, and other factors, and how much to ability to inspire?)</p>

<p>Apropos of nothing, a some random thoughts&#8230;</p>
<p>Whatever happened to all the black helicopters that were flying around spying on good patriotic Americans when Clinton was in office?  Will they come back if a Dem wins the next presidential election?</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia has been something of a cause for concern for the US for a while.  Its not just Osama and 15 of 19 hijackers on 9/11.  Its also what Saudi textbooks say about Christians and Jews, its other Saudi support for extremism, Saudi dislike of America and our way of life, etc.  I&#8217;ve never done business with anyone in Saudi Arabia, much less the folks who run the country.  Neither has anyone in my family.  Folks in GW&#8217;s family do.  </p>
<p>Iran is in the news these days &#8211; the administration is pretty apoplectic about it.  I&#8217;ve never done business with Iran.  When Cheney was CEO of Halliburton, Halliburton did business with Iran.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got work to do, but these random thoughts come easily.  Maybe I should read Jonah Goldberg&#8217;s Liberal Fascism&#8230;</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Its Tuesday.  Which means yesterday the NRO gave us another <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDFlMzUwODVkOWEzZGIyYjI2OWFmMTE5NGQ3Mjg4Mjk=">Kudlow kolumn</a>.  His latest has this gem:</p>
<blockquote><p>A middle-class tax cut to help families and small businesses would also work wonders. This can be done by collapsing the three middle-income tax brackets of 15 percent ($15,650), 25 percent ($63,700), and 28 percent ($128,500) into one 15 percent bracket.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/05in07tr.xls">This table from the IRS</a> tells us that in 2005, the top 5% of taxpayers had incomes of $152,048 or up.  The top 10% had incomes of $105,958 and up.  Thus, someone earning $128,500 is somewhere between the top 10% and top 5% when it comes to income.  That, to Kudlow, is middle-income. </p>
<p>What about at the bottom?  Well, there&#8217;s <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/05in11si.xls">this other table from the IRS</a>, which tells us that in 2005, 27.5% of all taxpayers had incomes below $15,000.  They wouldn&#8217;t get helped by this proposal of Kudlow&#8217;s. </p>
<p>So Kudlow&#8217;s middle income tax cut would help everyone except the bottom  27.5%, and the top seven or eight percent.  Actually, strike that&#8230; the top seven or eight percent would benefit too&#8230;  the first $128,500 of their income would now be taxed at only 15%.   Right now, as per Kudlow&#8217;s numbers, they pay $2,348 on the first $15,650, $12,013 on the next $48,050, and $18,144 on the next $64,900, for a total of $32,504 on their first $128,500 &#8211; or about a 25% effective rate.  Kudlow&#8217;s proposal would mean their income taxes would drop to $19,275&#8230;</p>
<p>In other words, their income taxes would drop by $13,229.  Someone who makes $13,229 a year, of course, would get nothing.  </p>
<p>Which leads me to a comment and a modest proposal.  The comment&#8230; Kudlow calls it a &#8220;middle-class tax cut&#8221; but it seems to be clearly an attempt to get just about everyone&#8217;s tax rate down to the rate paid by those with lowest incomes.  Why not have the honesty to simply call it what it is: a flat tax?</p>
<p>But now, a modest proposal for how Kudlow can improve his tax cut.  See, he can collapse the rates for incomes between $15K and $128.5K&#8230; but why not raise the rates on the those who make below $15K?  Because if cutting taxes on people with middle and high incomes &#8211; excuse me, apparently they&#8217;re all middle-income folks to Kudlow &#8211; will encourage them to do more of what they&#8217;re doing, raising rates on those making less than $15K will encourage them to get off their behinds and earn more money to get into the lower tax brackets, right?  Because the current policy of pandering to the poor isn&#8217;t doing it.  I&#8217;d say 90% is a good starting point &#8211; a nice bit of encouragement, and what&#8217;s really cool is that he could then cut tax rates below 15% on income between $15K and $128.5K to make the whole thing revenue neutral.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Yesterday I noted that there is a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/blog-carnival-soliciting-entries-on.html">blog carnival on Social Security</a> coming up, and I suggested that readers might like to to write some guest posts on the topic which I would then post and submit to the blog carnival.  Even the comments to that post were very instructive &#8211; I&#8217;m going to cut and paste some pieces (and hopefully encourage commentators flesh these out into full posts):</p>
<p>Bruce Webb notes that the Social Security going bust theme depends on productivity being very low:</p>
<blockquote><p>No one has explained to my satisfaction why a mid-range estimate of 2.2% Real GDP in 2013 is a good faith projection. As a possible outcome certainly but is there really a 50% chance that the economy will actually perform worse than that? Forever? In fact no one has even tried to justify this number. For one thing it makes hash out of tax cut claims.</p>
<p>If someone came to me and suggested that it would be very optimistic to assume that the economy in the next 45 years could match growth rates of the last 45 years and that 3.3% Real GDP should be a ceiling, 2.8% should be a midrange and 2.3% a floor I might grumble a little because all of those are low by historical standards 2007 Report: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/V_economic.html#wp192078">V.B2 column 4</a>.  As it is I am being told that over the fairly short term that the ceiling is 2.8%, the midrange is 2.2%, and the floor 1.6% and sinking. Well I cry bullshit, whatever happens near term no one really believes that 2.2% Real GDP number.</p></blockquote>
<p>Coberly adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are some who think all this can be finessed simply by taking SS money and investing it in &#8220;the market.&#8221; They are wrong. Certainly they have made no case that does not depend on the illusion that what you can do with a calculator you can do in real life. Hint: where do you suppose the money to pay big dividends, or higher stock prices, comes from?</p>
<p>The answer would be growth&#8230; so your challenge is to show convincingly how SS money will contribute to meaningful growth&#8230;and how you will feed the elderly while you are doing this.</p>
<p>but to restate the bottom line: the Trust Fund is NOT Social Security. It can go exponential as Bruce expects, paying not only for SS but for the rest of the government, or it can be stolen by a flying saucer. SS is simply a plan to pay for the elderly by having saved their own money when they were working.</p></blockquote>
<p>M. Jed disagrees&#8230;.  he points out that he doesn&#8217;t argue that SS is going bust, but he does think privatization can help:</p>
<blockquote><p>So with real GDP growth of 2.0-2.5%, ( I believe this is the Intermediate cost 75-year assumption) it isn&#8217;t unreasonable to assume real domestic equity returns can reach 6%. Thus with 2-3% inflation, nominal returns would be 8-9%.</p></blockquote>
<p>Terry Gardiner also looks at privatization, and excerpts from a letter he sent to his congresscritter:</p>
<blockquote><p>My own experience as a CEO of a company with hundreds of employees trying to invest their 401K in the market cast grave doubts on the viability of millions of Americans individually investing private accounts. The average employee works very hard at his job, has little time to become a genius investor, examine thousands of investment options, track the markets and project macro economic trends impacting investments. Most employees end up being very frustrated, gyrating from one strategy to the next and recording earnings below the market average. Investment fees and costs end up being a very large percentage of the total earnings of the 401k owner. There are many investment professional who take advantage of individual investors – the investment professional takes no risk. It would be much safer and meet the retirement goals of millions of Americans, if independent, accountable experts with no conflict of interests were used to invest the private accounts. The goal of private accounts investing in the stock market can be achieved, but without unnecessarily risking the irreplaceable retirement of American citizens.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its clear that there are a lot of smart people who have put a lot of thought into this.  To the folks that I excerpted, and to others&#8230;  if you write it the odds are extremely high I will post it.</p>
