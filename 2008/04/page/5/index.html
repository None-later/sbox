                                                                    </div>

                                <p>With all the discussion of food and energy it helps sometimes to look at the data and put things in perspective.  One reason that the rise in food and energy is having a smaller impact than in the 1970s is that they now account for a much smaller share of consumption. Food and energy fell from 30% of nominal consumption at the peak in 1980 to only 18% at the bottom in 2001. They still only accounted for 20.1%, of consumption in the fourth quarter, compared to 27.1% at the bottom in 1973.  So the adjustment to higher food and energy prices still does not have to be as large as in the 1970s.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SA-DgXgv8AI/AAAAAAAAANM/5wKSC6QprI4/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SA-DgXgv8AI/AAAAAAAAANM/5wKSC6QprI4/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Second, the rise in energy&#8217;s  share of consumption has been much more gradual this cycle as it rose from 4.2% of consumption in  2002 to  6.4% last quarter. From 1978 to 1980  energy&#8217;s share jumped two percentage points in two years compared to the five years it has taken this cycle.  In the two 1970s cycles the rise in food prices was concurrent with the rise in energy prices.  But this cycle, food costs are just now starting to squeeze the consumer as food&#8217;s share was still at near record lows at the end of 2007. <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SA-Dongv8BI/AAAAAAAAANU/iUTG1ke9P00/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SA-Dongv8BI/AAAAAAAAANU/iUTG1ke9P00/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />As this chart shows one of the ways consumers adjust to higher food and energy prices is putting off purchasing new cars and parts.  We are seeing this adjustment this cycle just as we did in the 1970s.  But again, it is being much more gradual.  In 1970s cycles auto spending fell two percentage points in one year in 1974 and two years in 1978-80.  So far auto sales have fallen just sort of two percentage points this cycle, but it has been spread out over six years since 2001.</p>
<p>This much more gradual emergence of the consumer squeeze is one of the reasons that we are not seeing a sharp jump in involuntary inventory accumulation this time  and why higher energy and food prices are not generating a major recession as in the 1970s. A major recession may still emerge, but the situation this cycle is sufficiently different from the 1970s that one can not simply use the 1970s as a good guide of what to expect.</p>

                                <p>While last year holds the warmest on record over land, La Nina has cooled the oceans somewhat. The real clues are the glaciers. Keep an eye out for glacial lakes bursting, sending tsunami-like destruction below. Glaciers have been rapidly losing mass worldwide. That water has to go somewhere. Sometimes ice dams it high in the mountains; other times, the lake overflows or breaks its retaining wall. When that dam breaks, nothing can stop the resultant tsunami. Below are two recent events deserving attention:</p>
<p>The <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90781/90879/6392400.html">first</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Raising world temperatures are blamed for melting ice in southern Chile that caused a glacial lake to swell and then empty suddenly, sending a tsunami-like wave rolling through a river, a scientist said Thursday. No one in the remote region was injured.<br />Glacier scientist Gino Casassa said the melting of the Colonia glacier, which he said were the result of rising world temperatures, filled the Cachet Lake and increased pressure on the ice sheet.<br />The water bored a 5-mile tunnel through the glacier and finally emptied into the Baker River on April 6.<br />&#8220;The remarkable thing is that the mass of water moved against the current of the river,&#8221; Casassa told The Associated Press by telephone from the Center for Scientific Studies in the southern city of Valdivia. &#8220;It was a real river tsunami.&#8221;<br />The lake was nearly full again by late Wednesday, he said. </p></blockquote>
<p>That this article appeared in a Chinese newspaper is not accidental.  China and countries the Himalayans feed have cause for concern. Punakha, Buhtan awaits its own <a href="http://www.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=88965">fate</a>:<br />
<blockquote>High in the Himalayas, above this peaceful valley where farmers till a patchwork of emerald-green fields, an icy lake fed by melting glaciers waits to become a “tsunami from the sky.”<br />The lake is swollen dangerously past normal levels, thanks to the global warming that is causing the glaciers to retreat at record speed.<br />But no one knows when the tipping point will come and the lake can take no more, bursting its banks and sending torrents of water crashing into the valley below.</p></blockquote>
<p>And in Nepal, there are over 3000 glacial lakes, and in the<a href="http://www.astrek.com/asiantrekking/newsletters/ang%20tshering%20sherpa/globalwarming.htm"> last 40 years</a> almost as many have been formed.</p>
<p>By 2050, The Himalayas are expected to <a href="http://assets.panda.org/downloads/glacierssummary.pdf">lose</a> up to a fourth or more of their ice mass.</p>
<p>For China, there is no good news <a href="http://www.portofentry.com/site/root/resources/industry_news/4721.html">here</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Himalayan glaciers are shrinking at an average of 10 to 60 m annually, with some retreating by 74 m a year. In China, glaciers have been retreating at a rate of 5.5 per cent in the last three decades. With current climate change projections two-thirds of China&#8217;s glaciers are likely to disappear by 2050, and almost all would be gone by 2100.</p></blockquote>
<p>After the glaciers go, desertification will follow. Those glaciers are the primary water supply for much of China and India. While much of the debate about global warming seems arcane and picky, tsunami-like floods coming from high in the mountains will certainly be an eye-catcher.</p>

Douglas Holtz-Eakin responds in the <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=N2I1OTljNWU3MzRkNzgyYTMxYWY4YjVhYTJhMGFjMmM=">National Review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nowhere in the article does Meckler mention that John McCain has explicitly addressed entitlement spending and the need for action to cut spending today. John McCain has promised to address Social Security by demanding that Congress deal with the problem, or he will send a bill to them for an up or down vote. Also, McCain’s health care reform plan will act to control out-of-control costs which are fueling Medicare and Medicaid spending. By addressing entitlements now, John McCain can reduce federal spending today and prevent Meckler’s doomsday scenario.  Meckler’s scenario also fails to address the basic budget situation that the United States finds itself in today. Under the current Director, Peter Orzag, the Congressional Budget Office issued a long-term budget outlook demonstrating that even under current laws for revenues (i.e., the huge Democrats’ huge tax increase planned for 2011) spending in the federal budget explodes well beyond any feasible revenues. The United States cannot tax its way out of this fiscal challenge. We must cut spending and John McCain alone has been honest about our future scenario. The basic facts are that no matter what we must cut spending.  The article’s review of “history” fails to note that John McCain’s economic proposals will fuel growth in the economy and that is central to success.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not surprised that he had to resort to asking the National Review to publish what is truly a feeble rebuttal.  I’m glad he appealed to the analysis of the CBO as it does provide a nice breakout of projected spending and revenues.  Even if health care spending does not explode as a percent of GDP, the General Fund will not be providing enough revenues to pay for non-Social Security spending.  Which is why John McCain’s only prays for balancing the budget rest on: (1) some implausible supply-side miracle (“fuel economic growth … central to success); and (2) raiding the Social Security Trust Fund.  But let me suggest a little clarity in writing be used by McCain’s economic advisors.  If his game plan to eventually balance the Federal budget relies on that backdoor employment tax increase from reducing Social Security benefits by much more than payroll “contributions” are reduced – just have their candidate say so.  I’m sure the voters will applaud such straight talk.  You think?</p>

                                <p>While the West struggles with its economic crisis, <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/chinese-companies-continue-uk-shopping/story.aspx?guid=%7BA0FB9E55-3369-4DAD-B1EA-1B03081D61EF%7D&#038;dist=msr_1">China</a> is busy picking up the pieces.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chinese businesses are acquiring more offshore interests than ever before and the country was the most active foreign buyer in the U.K. last quarter, according to analysis Tuesday from Grant Thornton Corporate Finance.<br />Chinese businesses are making more acquisitions outside national borders as the country has built up huge surpluses during its economic boom and through its currency controls.<br />Announced foreign acquisitions by Chinese companies in the first quarter were worth GBP11.91 billion, almost equaling the total deal value of 2007.<br />&#8220;China is on a shopping spree fueled in large part by high levels of consumer spending in the West. Expect Chinese SWFs (sovereign wealth funds) or private equity groups backed by Chinese equity to acquire some big name brands in Britain during the final part of the decade, particularly those in minerals and fossil fuels, which remain top of the shopping list in China,&#8221; he [Stephen Weatherby]said. </p></blockquote>
<p>A few years ago, I remember Elaine Supkis ranting in Setser&#8217;s blog that China would have us for breakfast. Elaine was not great on the details, but she saw the writing on the wall.</p>
<p>In his <a href="http://www.uscc.gov/hearings/2008hearings/written_testimonies/08_02_07_wrts/08_02_07_setset_statement.php">testimony</a> before the Council of Foreign Relations, Brad Setser nicely describes the present trajectory of China&#8217;s impact on the world economy:</p>
<blockquote><p>China’s economic success is often attributed to its embrace of the market. Directionally, that is no doubt true. However, the structure of its economy remains quite different from the structure of the US and European economies. Chinese state-owned enterprises and state-owned banks have a far large role in the US – and as a result, the expansion of Chinese firms abroad likely will imply the expansion of state-owned firms abroad. Moreover, China’s exchange rate regime has effectively given the China’s state – in all of its forms – a monopoly on the outward flow of funds from China. Private investors would prefer to invest in China and benefit from the expected appreciation of the RMB, not invest abroad and try to eke out positive returns in the face of the expected depreciation of the euro and the dollar against the renminbi.</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think China will have problems, but not of the kind that it expected. Economically, its game plan <i>seems</i> to be working; but there are not enough resources to pull China into the 21st century, but that is another story.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things happening in my life right now requiring big decisions and I need to take a break from less pressing needs for a while to sort them out. I don&#8217;t know when or if I&#8217;ll be back writing for Angry Bear. Its possible you may not even see me in the comments section, but if that happens, I will still be there, lurking. I&#8217;ve enjoyed this blog so much since I first discovered it several years ago, and I don&#8217;t see how that could possibly change. I think the remaining writers at the blog are amazing, but as much as I&#8217;ve learned from them, what makes this site truly great, in my opinion, are the many people who post comments. Another thing that distinguishes Angry Bear from many other sites are all the guest posts &#8211; keep &#8217;em coming, folks, keep &#8217;em coming. And if you&#8217;ve never written one, I strongly urge you to do so. But from now on, send them to one of the other Angry Bears! </p>
<p>Its been both a privilege and one heck of a lot of fun to write for Angry Bear, but all things must end, and at least for now, that includes my days of writing at a blog. Thank you all very much for the gift you have given me. </p>

Leonhardt writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mr. Holtz-Eakin came into Mr. McCain’s orbit during the 2000 presidential campaign, and the two men were a good match. Both of them are economic conservatives who focus more on the need to restrain government spending than on the social good it may accomplish. And they’re absolutely right that spending is the main long-term problem. In all, federal taxes now equal about 19 percent of the nation’s economic output, which is in line with the historical average. But the costs of Medicare and Medicaid, on their current path, would require that number to rise to an unmanageable 30 percent, and beyond, in coming decades. “We as a nation cannot tax our way out of this problem,” Mr. Holtz-Eakin says. “It’s just not an option.” To deal with the deficit, Mr. McCain has said that he will get tough on year-to-year spending, both in military programs and domestic ones.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation – tax cuts are not the problem, spending is.  But the suggestion that McCain will slash and burn spending is not <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/mccains-fuzzy-math.html">credible</a>.  Dean rises above this silliness and offers:</p>
<blockquote><p>the reason why the costs of these programs are projected to explode is that health care costs in the United States are projected to explode.  This would seem to suggest that the problem is health care, not spending. The country has to fix its health care system. Or, if the government is too incompetent or corrupt to fix the health care system we could simply outsource much of our health care to countries that have more efficient health care systems. Unfortunately, the protectionists in Washington and in the media are doing their best to prevent the idea of free trade in health care services from even being discussed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean offers us this <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/medicare-choice-plus-the-answer-to-the-long-term-deficit-problem">paper</a> to review.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB120882415111033181.html?mod=blog">Laura Meckler</a> provides a nice discussion of McCain’s fiscal fraud:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. John McCain is proposing tax cuts that would either cause the federal deficit to explode or would require unprecedented spending cuts equal to one-third of federal spending on domestic programs.  Once thought of as a deficit hawk, the near-certain Republican presidential nominee is now putting more stress on the traditional Republican orthodoxy of tax cuts. Altogether, he proposes more than $650 billion in tax cuts a year, much of it benefiting corporations and upper-income families. That includes the cost of extending tax cuts implemented under President Bush that he voted against twice.  To help pay for it all, the Arizona senator says he would cut $160 billion a year from a federal discretionary budget that totals a little more than $1 trillion. He hasn&#8217;t specified where the cuts would come from.  With military spending &#8212; about half the total &#8212; likely to rise or perhaps stay even, most if not all of the cuts would have to come from domestic programs. The discretionary budget, which excludes entitlements such as Medicare or Social Security, covers areas such as medical research, federal prisons, border security, student loans, food inspections and much else.  The $160 billion figure is equal to the total budget in 2007 for the departments of Education, Energy, Homeland Security, Justice and State. The chances of cuts of this magnitude are &#8220;nonexistent,&#8221; said Robert Bixby, executive director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that promotes fiscal discipline. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a consensus to cut back on the functions of government that much,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those are very, very deep cuts.&#8221;  When he talks about cutting spending, Sen. McCain usually focuses on congressional earmarks, home-state projects that members of Congress insert into spending bills. His stump speech mentions a museum commemorating the Woodstock festival in New York and the infamous &#8220;bridge to nowhere&#8221; in Alaska. But earmarks total only about $18 billion a year, according to independent estimates.  Sen. McCain and his aides haven&#8217;t said where he will get his $160 billion in annual discretionary-spending cuts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if government spending is cut by $160 billion a year, the $650 billion reduction in tax revenues means that the near $500 billion a year General Fund deficit will double to $1 trillion a year.  But even this $160 billion a year figure is a fantasy:</p>
<blockquote><p>That leaves domestic spending. The cuts that would be needed to balance the books are &#8220;inconceivable,&#8221; and &#8220;wildly draconian,&#8221; Mr. Greenstein said. &#8220;No president would really propose it and no Congress of either party would really pass it.&#8221; Asked Sunday where he would find spending cuts, Sen. McCain mentioned ethanol subsidies, sugar-price supports and payments to wealthy farmers. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to scrub every institution of government,&#8221; he said on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;This Week.&#8221; &#8220;Is there any American that doesn&#8217;t believe that there&#8217;s tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars that can be saved?&#8221;  An analysis of federal spending since 1976 show that there has never been a cut in domestic spending as large as what Sen. McCain is proposing, said Richard Kogan, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The biggest was in 1982, led by President Reagan, when federal spending was cut by about 17%; most of the cuts were reversed over the next few years, he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meckler provides a chart that suggests closing tax loopholes would raise $30 billion but that’s $30 billion over the decade – not per year.  And of course, the chart includes a supply-side effect but that’s only $20 billion. So if McCain get his way, we’re talking a General Fund deficit in excess of $1 trillion per year.  And yet we see:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. McCain has backed off his earlier promise to eliminate the budget deficit by the end of his first term and now says it may take two terms.  As for tax cuts, Sen. McCain promises to cut the corporate tax rate to 25% from 35% and allow corporations to deduct the full cost of equipment in the first year. He would double a tax break for families with children and eliminate the alternative minimum tax.  Sen. McCain&#8217;s chief economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, says he doesn&#8217;t have to find offsetting spending cuts for extending the Bush tax cuts or for eliminating the AMT for middle-class families because those policies are assumed in Washington. Nonetheless, projected deficits will increase if these taxes are cut without offsetting spending reductions.  His campaign also says there is no cost to a proposal regarding the tax treatment of capital expenses. Outside experts put the cost at tens of billions of dollars a year.  Under that plan, the federal government would take an upfront tax hit and be forced to pay additional interest on a larger national debt, said Ronald Pearlman, a tax professor at Georgetown Law Center and assistant secretary for tax policy under President Reagan.  To say there is no cost to the government is &#8220;so intellectually dishonest it&#8217;s outrageous,&#8221; Mr. Pearlman said. Mr. Bounds, the McCain spokesman, responded: &#8220;Clearly there is a difference of opinion here.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Difference of opinion – please.  I was taught 2 plus 2 equals 4 but I Mr. Bounds would disagree as even basic arithmetic is just a matter of opinion!</p>

<p>I’ve yet to read <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/enlightenment-you-and-me-and-china-make.html">the book but the summary is promising</a> — which is somewhat surprising given the lack of time the author has spent in China.  It’s a fact that growth is vital in China’s “bicycle economy” (doesn’t do slow), and that the institutional underpinnings of growth are strained, where they exist at all.  </p>
<p>The native Chinese entrepreneurial spirit (aided by transplants from Hong Kong and Taiwan) has carried things far, but constraints on the legal, political, environmental, social, educational, you name it sides, are painfully obvious.  Obvious to the leadership as well as to many of the more enlightened subjects of this regime.  This brings life in China a certain tension that most of us over here feel.  A kind of “something’s got to give” feeling.  Yes, they’re subjects, not citizens, and many are painfully aware of the one-way nature of the leadership as a shortcoming in their system.  But most of us (anywhere) are more afraid of chaos here today, than oppression, and crave stability more than individual freedom.   That goes double for a country like China undergoing such radical change. </p>
<p>And as for the nationalistic hubris that one finds so repellent in any big, powerful country, privately, away from the crowds, this animus can easily be tempered by an appeal to what’s in China’s best interest, rather than taking the preachy route.  Many Chinese friends of mine can only bitterly agree that governments of all major powers are only concerned with maintaining the interests of those who own them.  Having lived abroad for most of my adult life, I can only say that political leaders’ hypocrisy, worldwide, varies only as to constituency and tactics.  The enlightened principle of a constitutionally limited republic is a treasure that expressly requires constant vigilance on the part of citizens.  Americans regularly display their disinterest in that sort of work, if they even are aware of it.  Begin with this attitude rather than trying to say that GWB is Thomas Jefferson incarnate and see what kind of reaction you’ll get from the average Chinese young person.  </p>
<p>Don’t make the mistake of confusing modernization with westernization.  While western “core tenants” have featured in China’s modernization drive for about one hundred years (see New Culture Movement and May 4 Movement) the realities intellectuals faced then and now demand compromises, at least to hear them speak of it.  A synthesis is not only likely in China’s case, you see it happening every day, albeit at a pace that has yet to match its erection of showcase projects.  The alternative to such a synthesis is simply frightening to contemplate. </p>
<p>More important for the west, I think, is to be true to your school, and to be alert to how we ourselves have traded off our principles in the name of security.  And if this is the point that Hutton is making, I just may buy his book.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers may recall we&#8217;ve been having a dispute over $4,000 charged by a vendor.  Long story short &#8211; my wife signed up for a series of courses with an outfit out of Florida after having being told that the courses were fully refundable should she need to cancel.  She ended up canceling, but the refund was denied.</p>
<p>So&#8230; here&#8217;s where we are.  At the advice of an attorney, we have contacted the Attorney General of California (where we live and one of the courses was to be taken), Florida (where the Institute is located), and Nevada (where one of the courses was to be taken).  We also filed a claim for $7,500 in small claims court.</p>
<p>While we had made several attempts to contact them for redress in the past, I decided to try once more.  After the Institute and its top officer had been served this morning, I sent them an e-mail laying out why I thought we were owed the refund.  I noted that the documentation they had provided included five different cancellation policies, some of which had impossible terms (e.g., requiring cancellation almost an entire year before my wife had originally contacted them). I also noted other issues.</p>
<p>I ended with this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Having spent hours going through the documentation you provided to AmEx, I would simply note that the documentation contains other problems that may be even more serious.  We have already sent copies of this documentation and a letter indicating many of the discrepancies in that documentation to the Attorney General&#8217;s Office in California, Florida, and Nevada.  I expect our next steps will be to send the same documentation to the AGs of other states where courses are offered:  Illinois, Kentucky, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Washington and Georgia.  I also intend to provide the CPE and the NASBA.</p>
<p>All of this takes a lot of time and effort, but as I have noted to you in my previous correspondence on 3/24/08, all I want is the refund my wife was promised.  I will pursue any means at my disposal that are both legal and ethical to get that refund.  If you&#8217;d like to contact me to discuss this, I am at (323) 666 1184.</p></blockquote>
<p>I got this response.</p>
<blockquote><p>You have chosen to file a lawsuit against XXX and serve XXX with process, which was done today.  XXX will of course go through the necessary steps to retain counsel in California to defend the lawsuit.</p>
<p>You have further indicated that you intend to send complaints and documentation to the AG&#8217;s offices in a number of states, as well as NASBA.</p>
<p>American Express reviewed your claim and ruled that payment should be made.  We will of course provide this documentation in response to the paperwork which you have filed.  I have confimed with Amex today that the credit card has been charged for the full amount.  We had provided documentation to American Express that we would extend both the credit and the membership benefits beyond their original date.  Your actions will not change our offer.</p>
<p>In addition to the lawsuit you filed against XXX, you also filed one against me personally.  XXX is a state corporation not for profit, and has no owners.  I am not an owner.  The entity has no owners.  I am a contract employee, and you have sued me personally.  I take nothing from this entity but a paycheck, and when non-management employees have needs greater than their contracted salary, I dip into mine for their sakes. And for my involvement with this entity you have sued me personally.</p>
<p>I will now retain counsel in California and will ask them to pursue you to the fullest extent possible for naming me as a Defendant.  All of your actions speak of the worst kind of tactics, and cloaking them with words like &#8220;legal and ethical&#8221; does not change the fact that you have pursued me personally for the actions of the company which employs me.  This is nothing short of personal blackmail, and if you don&#8217;t have the good sense to be ashamed of yourself for causing me personal pain because I work for a company, I feel nothing but pity for you.</p>
<p>You want a battle, sir, you have just earned one when you went after me as an individual. Like you I will stay within the bounds of legal proceeding.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have changed the name of the the institute to avoid any further legal complications.</p>
<p>My wife is off to meet the attorney.  But in the meanwhile, and under the theory that getting several opinions might be useful, I&#8217;m curious.  What is she going to do?  Can she win?  Am I liable for blackmail?  Am I somehow liable for naming her as a defendant in a lawsuit?  Am I liable for providing documentation that originated with her organization to state AGs?  How much is all of this going to cost?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update.  Apparently we have a new reader.  The person who sent the e-mail just called up, apparently very upset.  She noted that I made an inaccurate statement on this post, namely that we sued for $4,000.  She is correct &#8211; we sued for $7,500, the other $3,500 being for compensatory damages.  I tried to get across that my position has always been the same &#8211; if I can get my refund before going to court, we don&#8217;t need a lawsuit. </p>
<p>In any case, my apologies for getting the figure wrong.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update 2.  Minor addition to the earlier update.  The person who sent the e-mail, when talking to me, said that the e-mail should not be interpreted as if to mean she is suing me.  I asked how I should interpret it, and she said something to the effect of that being up to me.  So I don&#8217;t know if this means I&#8217;m supposed to believe I&#8217;m being sued or not.</p>

<p>It’s been a while since I drew a few charts based on <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/gdu/gaspump.html">this source</a> but <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/04/puzzled.html">Menzie Chinn</a> got my thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have been puzzled by the proposal for a tax holiday for gasoline purchases running from Memorial to Labor day … with the objective of spurring the economy. First, the Federal tax is quite low, either in real or in relative terms. Second, the benefits that would accrue to consumers are probably pretty small, under reasonable assumptions … In relative terms, the total Federal tax has been shrinking as a share of gasoline prices, as gasoline prices have headed north (March = $3.293, all grades, inclusive of taxes). As of March 2008, the Federal tax accounted for 5.6% of that price.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even total taxes accounted for less than 13% of the price of gasoline.  Even if one added in the gross margins for the refineries and distributors, the non-oil share is only 28%.  Yep – of the current $3.24 per gallon price you are paying (on average), $2.33 is going to the owners of oil.  It hasn’t always been this way as our graph shows.  The oil share had fluctuated around 50% being as low as 35% at one point but since last summer, its share has dramatically increased. Our second graph shows that spikes in the refinery margin have been responsible for some of the past gasoline price increases but currently this margin is the same as the distribution margin or $0.26 per gallon. </p>
<p>A cut in the gasoline tax will not necessarily reduce the price of gasoline all that much as we have argued that the incidence will largely go to the suppliers.  Menzie also notes the incidence of the tax logic but he argues that about half of the benefit might accrue to consumers.  Menzie still argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>So this is the measure to jump start the economy? I think this measure would give relief to somebody. But I also think it&#8217;s a pretty blunt instrument by which to provide assistance to the driving public, or consumers, for that matter … Oh, and by the way, to the extent the lower price spurs gasoline consumption, this should increase the petroleum and petroleum products component of U.S. imports, and thence putting further upward pressure on the price of oil</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, this is not exactly the best use of fiscal policy to stimulated aggregate demand.</p>
