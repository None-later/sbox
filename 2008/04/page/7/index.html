                                <p>Frankel blames the rising cost of storable commodities on <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/03/falling-interest-rates-explain-rising.html">low interest rates</a>, an explanation now gaining favor among a number of economists. This may not be the case. We may in fact be seeing something more ominous: real—or perceived—shortages, not contrived, not something that any monetary policy can mend easily, i.e., by increasing <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/04/commodity_arbit.html">storage premiums</a>.</p>
<p>The question is: How can we tell the difference between a real or perceived shortage and one that can easily be mended by simply changing an economic factor such as interest rates or storage premiums? If we fail to understand root causes and just tinker with monetary policy, we will be inviting dangerous repercussions.</p>
<p>While perceived shortages are as dangerous as real ones, I contend that the shortages are real, growing, and dangerous. In an earlier <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/frankel-and-rapier-rising-cost-of-oil.html">post</a>, I argued that energy costs are rising in real terms. That argument I will extend to include the problem of supply, both in the near and long term.</p>
<p>Frankel’s Argument</p>
<p>Frankel explains his argument as follows:<br />
<blockquote>High interest rates reduce the demand for storable commodities, or increase the supply, through a variety of channels:<br />&#8211; by increasing the incentive for extraction today rather than tomorrow (think of the rates at which oil is pumped, gold mined, forests logged, or livestock herds culled)<br />&#8211; by decreasing firms’ desire to carry inventories (think of oil inventories held in tanks)<br />&#8211; by encouraging speculators to shift out of spot commodity contracts, and into treasury bills.</p></blockquote>
<p>Conversely, low interest rates do precisely the opposite: Increase the demand for storable commodities, or decrease the supply by
<ul>
<li>Decreasing the incentive to extract today what can be extracted tomorrow </li>
<li>Increasing firms’ desire to carry inventories (no longer as expensive to keep them)</li>
<li>Discouraging speculators</li>
</ul>
<p>Frankel would certainly agree that other factors—such as the rice crop failure in Australia—can indeed affect prices, but he cautions that looking at one commodity is a mistake. Because we are seeing an across the board rise in all agricultural and all mineral commodities, we must look at a factor all share in common. That factor for him is lower interest rates. Jim Hamilton <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/04/why_new_oil_pri.html">agrees</a>.</p>
<p>How does Frankel arrive at his conclusion? He does so through two graphs. The first is a line graph charting the rise of all commodities between 2000 and 2008. It is the one I find of most interest.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SAyeu4NyD0I/AAAAAAAAAAU/UHbmYSF8ivo/s1600-h/frankel+2000-2008+line.jpg"><img height="231" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_hcwm-NIIKbE/SAyeu4NyD0I/AAAAAAAAAAU/UHbmYSF8ivo/s320/frankel+2000-2008+line.jpg" width="409" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Initial Problems with the Explanation</p>
<p>He does not chart interest rates here. For the U.S., interest rates dropped markedly between 2000 and 2003; then remained relatively stable between 2004-2007. A number of observations are of interest here:
<ul>
<li>Oil price is the one price that most closely tracks the “all commodity price index.”</li>
<li>Metals price seems somewhat out of whack with the other three, spiking sharply in 2006, only to drop and then rise again.</li>
<li>Around 2004 prices started to rise significantly; by 2005, they had begun to climb markedly; after a small, brief dip in 2006, they again escalated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Energy Demands and Growth: The Real Problem</p>
<p>Oil is a central commodity; its price governs the price all of the others, especially agricultural commodities. While oil is important for the transportation of all goods, it plays an additional role in the production of many agricultural commodities, i.e., fertilizer and pesticides&#8230;. That oil tracks “all commodities” is, I think, no mistake. While interest rates do play a role in commodity prices, that is only the beginning of the story.</p>
<p>Most important is the following fact: In January 2008, the actual production of oil only slightly eclipsed the old May 2005 record, despite the fact many farmers, hoping to cash in on ethanol subsidies, used some of those crops—or land—to produce ethanol. Diversion of crop land is a form of extraction, to use Frankel&#8217;s terminology. Questionable ethanol subsidies aside, interest rates have not put a lid on this form of extraction.</p>
<p>In short, just at the time when energy demand is rising, we seem to be at a plateau in the production of oil.</p>
<p>Sadly, we are now in the position of having to use land itself to produce energy—and not food. That we now face food shortages should come as no surprise. We may well be bumping up against only one of the ugly realities that will face us this century: Not enough oil, something more dangerous, an energy shortage.</p>
<p>For those of you nautically minded, consider further some additional telltales: </p>
<ul>
<li>Between 2004 and 2012, China plans to add 562 coal-fired plants &#8211; nearly half the world total of plants expected to come online. India could add 213 such plants; the US, 72.[9] Note the date: 2004, a year before the last peak in oil production.</li>
<li>Expensive and environmentally costly mining of oil is now an option (Tar Sands)</li>
<li>Increasing interest in and exploitation of alternate energy sources: wind, solar, nuclear.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now consider the <a href="http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/ene_oil_con_percap-energy-oil-consumption-per-capita">following</a>:
<ul>
<li>In 2003, for every 1000 people, China consumed 4.96 barrels of oil each day. By 2005, it was consuming 5.009 barrels for every 1000 people. For a country of 1.3 billion, that is a significant rise in the demand for oil.</li>
<li>In 2003, India was consuming 2.18 barrels per 1000 people; by 2004, it was consuming 2.269.</li>
<li>In 2003, the U.S. consumed 68.87 barrels/1000 people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Surely, the pace has quickened since 2005, certainly in both India and China, which, combined, account for almost a third of the world’s population.</p>
<p>It is no longer a question of whether there is sufficient oil lying undiscovered or untapped. Those arguments have little weight here. <i>The speed at which both India and China approach the U.S. consumption levels has profound implications</i>. Continued world growth is now in question.</p>
<p>Because of its importance, the price of oil is inelastic. Supply is running headlong into increasing demand, affecting not only energy and transportation but actual production of essential commodities. When we have to divert crop land to the production of oil, we know we are in trouble.<br />END</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>During my ill spent youth, many years ago, I served with a seasoned non commissioned officer from somewhere in the rural old south, foothills of the Appalachians.  A colorful, experienced and outspoken commenter on the brass.</p>
<p>One day he returned from a visit with the top non com, with some now forgotten detail to do.  His only comment in my hearing was: &#8221; I would rather whittle a beak, strap it on and go out in the barn yard and peck @$%&#038; with the chickens.&#8221;  Saying this while he viewed his line up of smokes.</p>
<p>The job was some make work, look good detail designed by some smooth faced officer wanting to look good and &#8216;break starch&#8217;.  It was in this NCO&#8217;s veiw a wste of his time and talents.</p>
<p>In short &#8220;whittling a beak&#8221; is a measure of resources wasted in doing a job which never should be done and takes assets from more pressing needs.</p>
<p>He did do the job and never did &#8220;whittle a beak&#8221;.</p>
<p>That was long ago.  How many times had I whittled a beak would the taxpayer be better off! </p>
<p>The 95 weapons programs recently reviewed by GAO are all beaks that are being whittled at huge cost, resources that in every case should be used elsewhere.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whittle a beak&#8221; is code for opportunity lost and waste.</p>

<p>The Mausa Theory Of Neo-Con Rhetoric  (The &#8220;Father of Lies&#8221; Strategy) is:  &#8220;Say the opposite, and scorn truth, even when truth might help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Oh, I realize it&#8217;s more complex than that.  But it seems to be a chosen strategy, not a happenstance, and the rationale for its use can be found in a cult reference book, &#8220;Combating Cult Mind Control&#8221; by Steven Hassan, Park Street Press, 1988, 1990.  Read this excerpt, beginning on page 47, and tell me if it does not sound familiar:</p>
<blockquote><p>The mind, despite all of its strength and ability, has weaknesses too.  It is dependent on a stream of coherent information for it to function properly.  Put a person in a sensory deprivation chamber, and within hours he will start to hallucinate and become incredibly suggestible.  Likewise, put a person into a situation where his senses are overloaded with non-coherent information, and the mind will go &#8220;numb&#8221; as a protective mechanism.  It gets confused and overwhelmed, and critical faculties no longer work properly.  It is in this weakened state that people become very suggestible to others.</p>
<p>[Hasan then talks about the four components of mind control; these are behavior control, thought control, emotional control and information control.]</p>
<p>One particularly effective hypnotic technique involves the deliberate use of confusion to induce a trance state.  Confusion usually results whenever contradictory information is communicated congruently.  For example, if a hypnotist says in an authoritative tone of voice, &#8220;The more you try to understand what I am saying, the less you will never be able to understand it.  Do you understand?&#8221;  The result is a state of temporary confusion.  &#8230; if a person is kept in a controlled environment long enough, hearing such disorienting language and confusing information, he will usually suspend his critical judgment and adapt to what he perceives everyone else is doing.  In such an environment, the tendency within most people is to doubt themselves and deferred to the group.</p>
<p>Sensory overload, like sensory deprivation, also effectively disrupts a person&#8217;s balance and makes them more open to suggestion.  A person can be bombarded by emotionally laden material at a rate faster than he can digest.  The result is a feeling of being overwhelmed.  The mind snaps into neutral and ceases to evaluate the material pouring in.  The newcomer may think this is happening spontaneously within himself, but the group has intentionally structured it that way.</p></blockquote>
<p>The type specimen, though far from the first, is &#8220;Liberal Fascism&#8221;, the book.  Here&#8217;s a widely read text which seeks to redefine the ideas of what is liberal and what is fascist as being equivalent to each other.  In truth, most of the work of this book is accomplished by its title.  Since most people have an incomplete idea of what fascism actually is and of its historical antecedents, it&#8217;s easy for the author to step in and reinterpret.</p>
<p>Then there are the companies whose sole job is to develop and promote &#8220;research&#8221; and &#8220;polls&#8221; which support the position of their employers or, just as good, confuse the issue.</p>
<p>The more important the topic, the more necessary that this motto be pursued: &#8220;Mendacium Solum Dicatur, Mendacium Solum Accipiatur, tamen somnium est licitus quoque&#8221;:  &#8220;May only falsehood be spoken, may only falsehood be heard, but nonsense is okay too.&#8221; And it cannot be accident … can you pick one instance in this administration where plain handsawn truth, fresh with the smell of simple sawdust, has been dispensed?  I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Black is white, defeat is victory, poverty is prosperity, fraud is commerce &#8212; but speaking falsehoods and nonsense is only half the strategy.  Truth itself must have its foundations shaken.  We would predict that keepers and enforcers of truth, such as scientists, librarians, media, historians, courts and all institutions of oversight have been meddled with, starved or discredited, bought up, sold off, or their overseers replaced with flunkies. And so they have, even to the extent of smearing the relatives of dead soldiers, soldiers whom the administration claims to support.  In the rush to attack any truthholder, they switch direction on a dime without any reference to what they may have said or done even hours before.</p>
<p>The fixed refusal to see the log in their own eyes, while decrying the dust mote in others, the complete lack of irony and personal insight, the bizarre ability to name themselves Christians while sidestepping Christ like a beggar in the street and ignoring His direct orders, the inability in economics to do simple addition and subtraction and deny anyone else the authorization to do it … this insanity is focused on disabling the ability of Americans to control the administration or hold malefactors to account for their performance, and as strategies go it is working dandy.</p>
<p>There is one course of study the neo-cons have mastered this century, courtesy of Professor the Reverend Charles Lutwidge Dodgson.  That is &#8220;ambition, distraction, uglification and derision&#8221;.  Reeling, writhing and fainting in coils are options, but washing, as always, is extra.</p>

                                <p>Maybe I should outsource my reviews of McCain’s fiscal proposals to <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/john_mccain_/2008/04/voodoo_economics_30.php">Mark Kleiman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bloomberg does a job on McCain&#8217;s Voodoo Economics 3.0. Again, it&#8217;s couched in &#8220;objectivese&#8221; &#8230; But they&#8217;ve got the numbers, and they catch McCain&#8217;s economic guru, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, with his analytical pants down, making him look like both a fool and a liar &#8230; The voters got fooled by this stuff when Reagan was pushing it, and again when Bush the Second was pushing it. Let&#8217;s hope that the third time is the charm. And let&#8217;s not forget that attacking McCain&#8217;s ideas is only half the battle. The key is to attack his character: it&#8217;s not just that the plan is bad, it&#8217;s that no competent and straight-talking person would even think of offering it.</p></blockquote>
<p>So here’s the highlights from Bloomberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>Two Washington research groups said McCain&#8217;s plan would cost more. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated his tax cuts would cost $5 trillion over a two-term presidency. The Tax Policy Center, run jointly by the Brookings Institution and Urban Institute, said they would cost $5.7 trillion McCain senior economic adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin dismissed such estimates as &#8220;fantasy-land budgeting.&#8221; McCain&#8217;s proposals, Holtz-Eakin said, would balance tax and spending cuts to meet his balanced-budget goals &#8230; To help pay for the tax cuts, Holtz-Eakin said, McCain would save $30 billion a year by eliminating so-called rifle shot provisions. Those include items such as tax breaks for small insurance companies.  But a Treasury Department report Holtz-Eakin cited as the source of his estimate states that $27 billion could be raised by eliminating narrowly used tax preferences spread over a decade, not a single year.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the fiscal restraint proposals amount to less than $3 billion a year?  For fiscal year ended October 31, 2007, the General Fund deficit was almost $500 billion.  It is expected to be $700 billion this year.  McCain wants to cut taxes and maintain high defense spending.  How can anyone think tax offsets that amount to $3 billion a year and a few reductions in earmarks will balance the budget?  Douglas Holtz-Eakin used to be better than this.</p>
<p>Update: McCain’s cocktail-napkin economics is further critiqued <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/04/20/mccain-capital-gains">here</a>.</p>

                                <p>While <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/stupidest-man-a.html">Brad DeLong</a> rightfully wants to nominate Lawrence Kudlow for Stupidest Man Alive, might I suggest that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/18/AR2008041802705.html?nav=rss_print/outlook">George Will</a> should be given serious consideration:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Fed has no mandate to be the dealmaker for Wall Street socialism. The Fed&#8217;s mission is to preserve the currency as a store of value by preventing inflation. Its duty is not to avoid a recession at all costs; the way to get a big recession is to engage in frenzied improvisations because a small recession, a.k.a. a correction, is deemed intolerable. The Fed should not try to produce this or that rate of economic growth or unemployment &#8230; A surge of inflation might mean the end of the world as we have known it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/04/george-wills-el.html">Mark Thoma</a> objects to Will’s description of the FED’s mission:</p>
<blockquote><p>George Will tries to talk about Fed policy, but if you don&#8217;t understand the Fed&#8217;s goals &#8211; and he doesn&#8217;t &#8211; then the analysis of policy will be based on a faulty premise and reach incorrect conclusions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark argues that it is the job of the FED to keep us close to full employment.  But if Will were correct that a rise in the inflation rate would lead to the end of the world, then one might understand his view on the role of the FED.  But I doubt any serious person thinks an increase in the inflation rate is THAT costly.  Even Lawrence Kudlow is not THAT stupid – is he?</p>

                                <p>Of all the low lights in the Bush-Cheney 2004 campaign was its dishonest and despicable claim that Al Qaeda was hoping the John Kerry would become President.  John McCain claims he wants a civil campaign.  As John McCain has been shown to be a liar on other issues, we see that his call for a civil campaign is just another <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/04/19/mccain-camp-says-hamas-wants-obama-2">big fat lie</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>John McCain’s campaign sent supporters a fundraising e-mail Friday that claims Hamas approves of Democrat Barack Obama’s foreign policy vision, and is hoping for his victory this fall &#8230; Obama supporter Rep. Robert Wexler responded to the McCain fundraising e-mail Friday. &#8220;John McCain likes to talk about the civil campaign he plans to run, and yet today he has engaged in a shameful, divisive, and cynical kind of politics that he pretends to reject — all in reckless pursuit of campaign dollars,&#8221; said Wexler, calling the message &#8220;empty tough talk and divisive fear mongering.&#8221; &#8220;We call on Senator McCain to reject this embarrassing and outrageous tone, and to join with Barack Obama in calling for an America that is united in its determination to isolate Hamas and support our ally Israel,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Wexler’s plea is spot on, I’m not holding my breath waiting for the GOP nominee to actually live up to his call for civility.</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s time for another edition of BARACK OBAMA: THE FINAL THROES! Last week Giblets revealed the dangerous levels of pussification inherent in Obama&#8217;s bowling skills and orange juice consumption while exploring the damage done by persistent rumors that the senator is secretly black. But this latest scandal has doomed the Obama campaign more than any dooming doom that has doomed it before, because this time Obama has Insulted America by saying that poor people in impoverished rural areas are somehow &#8220;bitter&#8221; about being poor and impoverished. For shame!</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I have been reading the book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Wall-Embrace-China-Partner/dp/0743275284">The Writing on the Wall</a>.  Mr. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Hutton">Will Hutton </a>is the author.</p>
<p>The book is billed as a look at what makes China tick and what the west should do about it.  I chose it on the strength of the reviews as I wanted to learn more about China in regard to our discussions concerning globalization.  I also wanted to hear a voice not from the US. Mr. Hutton is very established in the economic world in England.  Maybe he is their Mr. Krugman? </p>
<p>You can read a summary regarding the <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/jan/07/bookextracts.china">subject of China</a> by Mr. Hutton here.</p>
<p>In the book, he looks at the history of China and makes note of the similarity throughout time of the Chinese thinking of life.  He seems to have asked: What is their heritage and how does it inform us as to their future?  The conclusion: China needs to move through the period of enlightenment just as the west has.  China needs to allow the development of the culture that the Enlightenment Period birthed giving rise to people such as Tom Paine, our founders and Adam Smith if they want to succeed in applying a western capitalistic system.  This is the hitch in China&#8217;s current functioning.  Their communist ideology of one party rule can not hold if they are to sustain their historic annual growth.  And they must sustain the growth because they are such a large population.</p>
<p>From the above article by Mr. Hutton:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;but there are limits to how far the reformers can go without giving up the basis for the party&#8217;s political control. Conservatives insist that much further and the capacity to control the country will become irretrievably damaged; that the limit, for example, is being reached in giving both trade unions more autonomy and shareholders more rights. It is the most urgent political debate in China&#8230;<br />The maxims of Marxist-Leninst-Maoist thought have to stand, however much the party tries to stretch the boundaries, because they are the basis for one-party rule&#8230; <br />Enterprises are accountable to no one but the Communist party for their actions; there is no network of civil society, plural public institutions and independent media to create pressure for enterprises to become more environmentally efficient. Watchdogs, whistleblowers, independent judges and accountable government are not just good in themselves as custodians of justice; they also keep capitalism honest and efficient and would curb environmental costs that reach an amazing 12 per cent of GDP. As importantly, they are part of the institutional network that constitutes an independent public realm that includes free intellectual inquiry, free trade unions and independent audit. It is this &#8216;enlightenment infrastructure&#8217; that I regard in both the West and East as the essential underpinning of a healthy society. The individual detained for years without a fair trial is part of the same malign system that prevents a company from expecting to be able to correct a commercial wrong in a court, or have a judgment in its favour implemented, if it were against the party interest.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Over stir-fried curried chicken and crispy fried flying sea bass, the Chinese guests repeated politely and persuasively that China was making up new economic and political rules.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does that last sentence <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html">sound familiar</a>? <br />The aide said that guys like me were &#8221;in what we call the reality-based community,&#8221; which he defined as people who &#8221;believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality.&#8221; I nodded and murmured something about enlightenment principles and empiricism. He cut me off. &#8221;That&#8217;s not the way the world really works anymore,&#8221; he continued. &#8221;We&#8217;re an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you&#8217;re studying that reality &#8212; judiciously, as you will &#8212; we&#8217;ll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that&#8217;s how things will sort out. We&#8217;re history&#8217;s actors . . . and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do.&#8221; </p>
<p>This brings me to why I&#8217;m writing about Mr. Hutton&#8217;s book.  He&#8217;s not just writing about China and what the west needs to do, he is writing about us and what we are loosing.  By loosing our enlightenment heritage, we will loose our way with China.  The most striking thought I had as I read through the chapters on China was that his descriptions were familiar.  </p>
<p>Even though the book is in chapters, the layout is in two parts; China and then the US. Though, the US does stand as a sort of proxy for the west in part as Mr. Hutton&#8217;s other writings have noted the trends away from enlightenment derived ideology within his country; just not too the extent of the US.  I do not recall reading or hearing of anyone of position within the European Commons presenting such a thought as relayed in Ron Suskind&#8217;s article quoted above.  It is a thought that is not so harmful from the life of delusion it relays as much as it is harmful from the resultant action begot of condescension and dismissal of all other people.  I have not heard such personality coming from Europe.  Not hearing such, means Europe is more real than US and that means (if Mr. Hutton is correct) that the US of A is no longer the example to be followed by developing nations.  It means we are becoming irrelevant in the discussions regarding how to create a better world.  The light is on in the Statute of Liberty, but no one is home.</p>
<p>As he describes what China needs to create specifically, I could not help think “but we&#8217;re going in just the opposite direction.”  There is the distinct possibility that we could meet China half way.  This would be a great loss for the world because we would have pulled back from the gains Mr. Hutton attributes to our passage through the enlightenment as much as China would have move toward it. Essentially the movement would result in leaving two mega economic powers in a state of half-fastness.  The US having not sustained it&#8217;s progress of enlightenment derived social structure, thus a half-fast job of living and China not completing it&#8217;s progress through enlightenment derived social structure, thus a half-fast job of living.  Where does that leave the rest of the world?</p>
<p>I believe we have seen such a reversal from enlightenment derived social structure in Putin&#8217;s Russia. We have in Putin a living example of the danger to a nation that let&#8217;s it&#8217;s fears pull it away from enlightenment.  He has undone much of what Mr. Gorbachev sacrificed for.  Mr. Putin has copied the posture of our current president Bush.  Most notably was Mr. Putin reserving the right to preemptive strike within I believe 2 weeks of President Bush establishing such a policy.   Mr. Putin&#8217;s governance is the manifestation of the harm of the implementation of “&#8230; and when we act, we create our own reality”.  Bush et al acted in all their glory of condescension and begot Putin who happens to be sitting on a lot of raw material the world needs for economic production.  </p>
<p>It is Mr. Hutton&#8217;s theory, that passing through the Enlightenment Period is the explanation for what we and Europe had accomplished and ably implemented in Japan and post WWII Germany that I want to discuss in the next posting.  I believe it will help us understand a lot of what we have discussed here at Angry Bear concerning what has happened in this nation.  Why do Cactus&#8217; graph show what they do. Why does PGL say we do not have to fear globalization.  Why Mr. Hutton states: <br />
<blockquote>Britain and the West take our enlightenment inheritance too easily for granted, and do not see how central it is to everything we are, whether technological advance, trust or well-being. We neither cherish it sufficiently nor live by its exacting standards. We share too quickly the criticism of non-Western societies that we are hypocrites. What China has taught me, paradoxically, is the value of the West, and how crucial it is that we practise what we preach. If we don&#8217;t, the writing is on the wall &#8211; for us and China. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Uncapping the payroll tax reveals still another cultural misstep by Sen. Obama. He apparently has a difficult time understanding that nowadays, a veteran fireman or a veteran cop, married to a veteran schoolteacher, will make well over $100,000. In fact, they can make close to $200,000. Yet Obama still wants to go ahead and tax both the first and last payroll dollar of this group at a very high marginal tax rate by uncapping the Social Security (FICA) tax. (Incidentally, I don’t think Mr. Obama knows any cops or fireman. How about that? That is the problem. In other words, his economics are bad and his social circle is very limited.)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_04_13_archive.html#7217668819124798090">Duncan Black</a> have been laughing so hard that he omitted the sentences in parenthesis:</p>
<blockquote><p>The FICA cap is an individual cap, unaffected by income earned/payroll taxes paid by your spouse.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/stupidest-man-a.html">Brad DeLong</a> has a new nominee for Stupidest Man Alive:</p>
<blockquote><p>One would think that National Review would want to maintain a smidgeon of a reputation, and hence at least edit Larry Kudlow for his biggest howlers. But no.</p></blockquote>
<p>The only problem with Brad’s suggestion is that if the National Review edited out Kudlow’s major whoppers, they’d be nothing left.  Almost every word this Klown writes is incredibly stupid.  No self respecting cop or fireman would even let Kudlow buy them a beer.  And Kudlow has demonstrated ad nauseum that he knows nothing about economics.</p>
<p>Update: AB reader Rollotomasi let’s us know that Kudlow likely does not under the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10003.pdf">current law</a>.  Let me explain by assuming a fireman who earns $98,000 (does Kudlow know even one fireman who earns this much) married to a school teacher who earns $102,000 (after all – school teachers must all be rich in Kudlow’s view of the world).  It seems that all of their $200,000 in income for 2008 will be fully taxed under the current law.</p>
