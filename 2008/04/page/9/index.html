                                                                    </div>

                                <p>It seems the blog world is almost universally panning how ABC ran last night’s debate so I thought I’d present a different view – that being from <a href="http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/no-whining-about-the-media/index.html?hp">David Brooks</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democrats, and especially Obama supporters, are going to jump all over ABC for the choice of topics: too many gaffe questions, not enough policy questions. I understand the complaints, but I thought the questions were excellent. The journalist’s job is to make politicians uncomfortable, to explore evasions, contradictions and vulnerabilities. Almost every question tonight did that. The candidates each looked foolish at times, but that’s their own fault … We may not like it, but issues like Jeremiah Wright, flag lapels and the Tuzla airport will be important in the fall. Remember how George H.W. Bush toured flag factories to expose Michael Dukakis. It’s legitimate to see how the candidates will respond to these sorts of symbolic issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>I didn’t see the debates and since hackazoid Brooks loved them, I concluded that I didn’t miss much at all.  Another hat tip to <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/04/brooks-celebrat.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> for his review of the review by Brooks:</p>
<blockquote><p>So Lee Atwater wins by default? We are losing a war, we have destroyed our fiscal future, the planet is in distress, we have effectively quit the Geneva Conventions, the economy, propped up by massive public and private debt, is teetering &#8230; and we all have to actually defend the fact that this election will be decided on the basis of closet Muslims, flag lapel pins, and &#8217;60s terrorists? Brooks actually gives ABC News an &#8220;A&#8221; for their questions. The job of debate moderators is to generate an actual discussion about the issues and questions that matter in deciding between two candidates. They make an editorial choice about what those questions are. To focus almost exclusively on idiotic process questions based on the lowest form of political debate imaginable is an editorial choice to run a tabloid freak show. I see no reason to excuse Obama&#8217;s bad performance. But I cannot fathom why we should exonerate the execrable standards of ABC News at the same time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Last night’s debate represent a shining example of what is wrong with our modern political processes.  That David Brooks gets any space with the New York Times is an example of what is wrong with our modern journalism.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.aol.com/story/_a/spains-new-defense-minister-is-pregnant/20080416151609990001">Spain&#8217;s new defense minister</a> has been a hot topic in Spain for awhile. I do not pretend to know the particular issues.</p>
<p>However, two issues emerged as central from the write up: </p>
<p>1. Lack of military experience. (I assume either directly or as a part of the defense ministry prior to her appointment). She has cabinet level experience.<br />2. Her pregnancy. (I assume part of that is a leave of absence, perhaps mental stability?)<br />3. I did not read any reporting on the fact she is a woman, so assume it is not an issue or is in the background.</p>
<p>The US has its own difficulties including women into the military, which is for a separate post. It did occur to me&#8230;</p>
<p>1. How many defense secretaries have had <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/osd/topleaders.aspx">defense experience</a> or <a href="http://www.defenselink.mil/">served in the US military</a>? What counts as experience?  I remember these people:<br />Robert Gates<br />Rumsfeld (Cheney)<br />William Perry<br />William Cohen<br />Brown<br />Robert McNamara<br />Frank Carlucci<br />James Schlesinger<br />2. If pregnancy is considered &#8220;medical&#8221;, is that different than say a man or woman prone to debilitating heart attacks? Or is pregnancy possibly easier than heart attack damage, mental or physical?<br />3. If Obama wins and Hillary would not accept being VP, which is sensible, is she tough enough to be Secretary of Defense?</p>
<p>I know this might be just a conversation&#8230;but no standing in line to comment.  The picture jarred me, but then I thought hmmmmmm&#8230;..<br />END</p>

                                <p>Yves Smith has a post entitled <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/04/why-happy-talk-about-credit-crisis.html">Why the Happy Talk About the Credit Crisis?</a></p>
<p>It begins:</p>
<blockquote><p>am frequently mystified at what goes on in the markets. I am even more mystified when people who ought to know better make pronouncements that appear to be profoundly counter-factual. Even if they are talking their own book, the high odds of being <strike>revealed as bald-faced liars</strike> proven wrong ought to make them worry about damaging their credibility.</p>
<p>Is this wishful thinking? Delusion? A hope that that a united front can change perceptions and therefore reality? (see this as Tinkerbell behavior: if we all clap together, the markets won&#8217;t die).</p></blockquote>
<p>Its an interesting post, and he provides plenty of examples.  And it got me thinking about <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/gw-explains-bs.html">GW&#8217;s admission</a> that he was BSing about the situation in Iraq in 2006, when it was fairly obvious that things were going badly.</p>
<p>So what was benefit?  Well, the soldiers on the ground knew the score, as did the insurgents, and a fair portion of the American public.  Maybe the Happy Talk is intended simply to keep the last true believers in line.  That buys time &#8211; anything can happen with time.  And it also buys a possible sucker to come take the problem off your hands.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the best I can come up with to Yves&#8217; question.  Anyone have a better answer?<br />END</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>This post is about taxes.  But people find taxes to be a boring subject, so let me begin by noting a few points that at first may seem like they have nothing to do with taxes:</p>
<p>1.  In recent weeks, there&#8217;s been no small amount of criticism toward Obama over his choice of Church, given that the minister has voiced some opinions which are offensive to many people.  Similarly, McCain has <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/14986.html">sought support from and campaigned with</a> a preacher who is well-known for having <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/02/29/john-hagees-mccain-endor_n_89189.html">beliefs that are offensive to many people</a>.</p>
<p>2.  The John and Cindy McCain Foundation seems to be dedicated to a single purpose:  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/john-and-cindy-mccain-foundation.html">improving the quality of McCain&#8217;s kids education and their career prospects</a>.  Similarly, folks on the right could tell you about the Clinton&#8217;s foundation.</p>
<p>Now Obama and McCain, and Clinton and anyone else for that matter, are welcome to associate with whoever they want.  But what I find interesting is that the government is in the business of encouraging some forms of offensive behavior, or at least, offensive behavior by some people.  For example, the government specifically encourages the two preachers referenced in item 1 above.  How?  Well, as any good conservative will tell you, if cut the marginal tax rate on an activity, you get more of it, and if you raise the marginal tax rate on an activity, you get less of it.  Donations to the organizations run by either of the two preachers are tax deductible, and thus, we are being given an incentive to make those donations rather than spend the money in other ways.  This is especially true if the donation also effectively <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/liberals-conservatives-charity-and.html">entitles you to benefits that under other circumstances would have to be paid for in non-deductible ways</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, as the second case shows, many acts of charity are not truly acts of charity.  If I donate money to an organization, and in exchange, they slap my name on the side of a building, and have a dinner in my honor, is it really charity?  Or is such behavior merely seeking adulation, and an opportunity to attend yet another event on the social season schedule? </p>
<p>FWIW, here&#8217;s what I do in my spare time:  I feed feral cats.  That means time and expenses (food, vet bills).  I&#8217;ve never so much as written any of that off.  I know other people with the same hobby, and they too aren&#8217;t writing any of it off.  Ditto many folks who feed homeless people. </p>
<p>So here&#8217;s what I can conclude about charitable donations&#8230;  Much of what constitutes charity, according to the tax code, is little more than self-serving activity, whether tax avoidance schemes or methods of self-aggrandizement.  Much of it constitutes encouraging behavior that is offensive to some, or even many other people.  Such activities will take place whether they are encouraged or not &#8211; why should they receive the government&#8217;s imprimatur, especially since much (most?) actually charitable behavior isn&#8217;t getting that benefit?</p>
<p>Eliminating charitable write-offs would eliminate these problems.  But they&#8217;d also do something else.  As I noted in the first post in this series, for a tax scheme to work any better than the current mess,  people need to believe <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/cactus-tax-proposal-part-i.html">its fair and applies to everyone</a>. Getting rid of loopholes of any sort is one step along the way, and charity is probably one of the most &#8220;useful&#8221; loopholes for any good accountant.</p>
<p>And once these loopholes and write-offs are eliminated, the tax rates we all pay can lowered, benefiting just about everyone, including those who don&#8217;t have the means to game the system and those who don&#8217;t support causes other people might find offensive.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Update&#8230; Added slightly to the conclusion, then modified it marginally.<br />END</p>

When asked why he kept insisting that things were going swimmingly in Iraq in the summer of 2006, when in reality, the place was falling apart, GW responded:</p>
<blockquote><p>BUSH: Well, yes. I think we — and I wanted — that&#8217;s as much trying to bolster the spirits of the people in the field as well as — look, you can&#8217;t have the commander in chief say to a bunch of kids who are sacrificing either, &#8220;It&#8217;s not worth it,&#8221; or, &#8220;You&#8217;re losing.&#8221; I mean, what does that do for morale?</p></blockquote>
<p>Which raises a question and a comment for the fighting 30%:</p>
<p>1.  Question:  With all due respect to the President, if he admits he was less than truthful then, is there any particular reason to believe he is truthful now?<br />2.  Comment: Remember, most folks on the left told you so back in the day.   Many of us also said the tax cuts were going to lead to exploding debt and not much growth, way back when.  So when making a decision about whom to believe &#8211; GW or the folks whose politics you don&#8217;t like, I think its obvious who you should believe.  </p>

                                <p>Cactus&#8217;s thoughts on taxes got me to thinking about trade, and the purpose of trade.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=the-mind-of-the-market">Behavioral economists</a> tried this experiment with people in face to face trade situations. Of course it is not definitive of anything, but it does point up a huge flaw in the economics of today.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;that “Economic Man” is rational, self-maximizing and efficient in making choices—make no sense. Take economic profit versus psychological fairness as an example.</p>
<p>Behavioral economists employ an experimental procedure called the Ultimatum Game. It goes something like this. You are given $100 to split between yourself and your game partner. Whatever division of the money you propose, if your partner accepts it, you are both richer by that amount. How much should you offer? Why not suggest a $90–$10 split? If your game partner is a rational, self-interested money maximizer, he isn’t going to turn down a free 10 bucks, is he? He is. Research shows that proposals that deviate much beyond a $70–$30 split are usually rejected.</p>
<p>Why? Because they aren’t fair. Says who? Says the moral emotion of “reciprocal altruism,” which evolved over the Paleolithic eons to demand fairness on the part of our potential exchange partners. “I’ll scratch your back if you’ll scratch mine” only works if I know you will respond with something approaching parity. The moral sense of fairness is hardwired into our brains and is an emotion shared by most people and primates tested for it. Thousands of experimental trials with subjects from Western countries have consistently revealed a sense of injustice at low-ball offers. Further, we now have a sizable body of data from peoples in non-Western cultures around the world, including those living close to how our Paleolithic ancestors lived, and although their responses vary more than those of modern peoples living in market economies do, they still show a strong aversion to unfairness.</p>
<p>The deeper evolution of this phenomenon can be seen in the behavior of our primate cousins. In studies with both chimpanzees and capuchin monkeys, Emory University primatologists Frans de Waal and Sarah Brosnan found that when two individuals work together on a task for which only one is rewarded with a desired food, if the reward recipient does not share that food with his task partner, the partner will refuse to participate in future tasks and will express emotions that are clearly meant to convey displeasure at the injustice. In another experiment in which two capuchins were trained to exchange a granite stone for a cucumber slice, they made the trade 95 percent of the time. But if one monkey received a grape instead (a delicacy capuchins greatly prefer over cucumbers), the other monkey cooperated only 60 percent of the time, sometimes even refusing the cucumber slice altogether. In a third condition in which one monkey received a grape without even having to swap a granite stone for it, the other monkey cooperated only 20 percent of the time. And in several instances, they became so outraged at the inequity of the outcome they heaved the cucumber slice back at the human experimenters!</p>
<p>Such results suggest that all primates (including us) evolved a sense of justice, a moral emotion that signals to the individual that an exchange was fair or unfair. Fairness evolved as a stable strategy for maintaining social harmony in our ancestors’ small bands, where cooperation was reinforced and became the rule while freeloading was punished and became the exception. What would appear to be irrational economic choices today—such as turning down a free $10 with a sense of righteous injustice—were, at one time, rational when seen through the lens of evolution.</p>
<p>Just as it is a myth that evolution is driven solely by “selfish genes” and that organisms are exclusively greedy, selfish and competitive, it is a myth that the economy is driven by people who are exclusively greedy, selfish and competitive. The fact is, we are equitably selfish and selfless, cooperative and competitive. There exists in both life and economies mutual struggle and mutual aid. In the main, however, the balance in our nature is heavily on the side of good over evil. Markets are moral, and modern economies are founded on our virtuous nature. The Gordon Gekko “Greed Is Good” model of business is the exception, and the Google Guys “Don’t Be Evil” model of business is the rule. If this were not the case, market capitalism would have imploded long ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>(See updates)</p>
<p>I found myself thinking of the picture of people standing in line waiting to get on  a ride at Six Flags, the only thing keeping the line intact being social convention, trust that the convention works overall, and that exceptions to the rule are small or manageable. Maybe some occasional &#8216;police action&#8217; on the part of the ticket taker. People do cut in but the line does not dissolve, and the people who do cut in are highly dependent on the line maintaining itself.</p>
<p>Then I found myself wondering if it is only predators who get ahead, and some who also simply work hard? (Many predators do work very hard). Is the narrative we are stuck with, that trade does not have a mutual interest and mutual aid component, really what we believe? And where does that fall into economic descriptions? Hence trade might have more than one dimension?  Most of us trade for mutual benefit and aid, so making 3.5 billion in one year and being on the money alpha list is less important?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cocomment.com/features">Cocomments</a> service allows you to track comments from old posts and tell you about new responses.  For some who visit multiple blogs and leave comments, you might find this easier than bookmarks and such.  It can be difficult to remember a few days after a comment was left.</p>
<p>Blogger has a notification system, but requires a comment be left to activate it.  And it will send you notification of your own comments.  Let me know if the co-comments are useful&#8230;it is evolving quickly.<br />END</p>

                                <p>The Treasury Department has released its <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/hp930.htm">Social Security. Issue Brief No. 4 is entitled Social Security Reform: Mechanisms for Achieving True Pre-Funding</a> with this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>there is nothing currently in place to prevent current contributions in excess of current benefits from being unwound by larger deficits in the non-Social Security portion of the federal budget &#8230; Many analysts believe that Social Security surpluses under the present system do not increase the government’s capacity to pay future Social Security benefits. Under this view, Social Security surpluses are offset in the rest of the federal budget by some combination of higher non-Social Security spending and/or lower non-Social Security taxes. To the extent that this is true, Social Security’s surpluses do not increase the government’s capacity to pay future Social Security benefits. The future benefit payments that would have been financed with public debt issuance had Social Security surpluses truly been saved must instead be financed with lower non-Social Security spending and/or higher non-Social Security taxes. In this case, the existence of the near-term Social Security surplus causes the non-Social Security budget to be more profligate, and the future Social Security cash deficit will require future non-Social Security budgets to have either higher taxes or lower spending than would have been the case had today’s surpluses resulted in true pre-funding. Under this scenario, an attempt to make Social Security fair to future generations by accumulating near-term surpluses in the trust fund would be undone by a non-Social Security policy that is less fair to future generations. Rather than resulting in resources that provide future benefits, running a Social Security surplus today would instead lead to more debt outside the trust fund that must be paid off by future generations, leaving them with no net gain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation – we at the Treasury are sort of excusing the massive General Fund deficits of the Bush Administration because those assets in the Social Security Trust Fund were just too easy to raid for political gain by our GOP hacks that “lead” us.  But the real gall comes here:</p>
<blockquote><p>In order for Social Security surpluses to be saved, taxes and spending in the non-Social Security portion of the budget must be set with the recognition that the special-issue government securities held by the trust fund represent liabilities that are every bit as real and important as debt held by the public. While the non-Social Security budget must ultimately redeem those special-issue securities in any case, it is only when they are recognized as equivalent to publicly held debt that the non-Social Security budget will plan in advance for their redemption by using Social Security surpluses to reduce public debt issuance. When used to lower publicly held debt today, the surpluses increase the government’s capacity to issue publicly held debt to pay for Social Security benefits in the future. Otherwise, those future benefits must be financed with lower non-Social Security spending or higher non-Social Security revenues.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh my – those of us who have been allowed to pay less in income taxes over the past generation than what has been spent by the General Fund during this same period might actually have to pay more in income taxes in the future.  What do we tell the children?  Oh yea – get used to high employment taxes that were never intended for your retirement.  I have to say – our Treasury Department has certainly come up with some fancy language for good old fashion grand larceny.</p>

                                <p>High comedy courtesy of the April 15 edition of <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZjYyZTkwZmMzNDRlM2M3NzJlNWJhNWI3OWUxZDIzN2Q=">Kudlow and Company</a>!  So much to choose from but let’s start with John McCain’s plan to increase aggregate demand:</p>
<blockquote><p>KUDLOW: Recently, you’ve talked—you’ve said pretty clearly that the US economy is in recession. In terms of your speech today, can you tick off your major recovery points?</p>
<p>McCAIN: Bring spending, obviously, under control. That is very obvious.</p></blockquote>
<p>Excuse me but what’s obvious?  If we cut government spending, we reduce aggregate demand.  OK, I left off all the chatter about reducing tax rates to balance the budget as I wanted to move onto his proposal to cut gasoline taxes:</p>
<blockquote><p>KUDLOW: Come back to this summer gas tax holiday that you unveiled in your speech today. It’s a pretty interesting point. I don’t think anybody’s talked about anything like that. Let me just ask you, though, you’ve been very tough on the issue of carbon emissions, for example. Now, if you waive the gas tax&#8230;</p>
<p>McCAIN: Yeah.</p>
<p>KUDLOW: &#8230;for motorists, isn’t that going to actually spur gasoline consumption and increase carbon emissions?</p>
<p>McCAIN: Look, I’d love to tell you that would happen. We’re talking about 18 cents a gallon for regular fuel and 24 percent—24 cents for diesel. I’m not sure that it stimulates it. I think it eases the burden. The people that drive the furthest in America are the lowest income people.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh my God – McCain really doesn’t get the incidence of the tax issue, which was explained by a couple of links to my update to <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/04/john-mccain-proposes-more-global.html">this post</a>.  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=04&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=mccain_proposes_special_summer">Dean Baker</a> gets it:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the oil industry, they have their refineries running flat out, producing all the gas they can. This means that the price is determined on the demand side.  We have a fixed amount of gas entering the market, the question is simply what price clears the market. In this context, if we reduce or eliminate the gas tax, the price doesn&#8217;t change, the lower tax will simply allow Exxon and other oil companies to keep more profits (unless of course they were lying about running their refineries at capacity).</p></blockquote>
<p>By God – even a Klown like Kudlow get this:</p>
<blockquote><p>KUDLOW: ‘&#8230;isn’t this going to provide, ultimately, more revenues for Saudi Arabia and OPEC, which is the reverse of what you have argued for in the past?’</p>
<p>McCAIN: No, I don’t—look, I do not believe that we can continue our efforts to alternate fuels and alternate energy sources, including nuclear, which is vital, and still give Americans a little bit of relief and let them afford a vacation this summer.</p></blockquote>
<p>But even after Kudlow tried to explain this to McCain – he still doesn’t get it.  He really does not understand anything about economics – and yet he wants to be our next President?</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article19749.htm">This editorial</a> reminds us of the great increase in federal power regarding coercive force (also aid with guns).</p>
<blockquote><p>Section 1076 of the Defense Authorization Act of 2006 changed the name of the key provision in the statute book from “Insurrection Act” to “Enforcement of the Laws to Restore Public Order Act.” The Insurrection Act of 1807 stated that the president could deploy troops within the United States only “to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy.” The new law expands the list of pretexts to include “natural disaster, epidemic, or other serious public health emergency, terrorist attack or incident, <em>or other condition</em>” – and such a “condition” is not defined or limited. </p>
<p>One might think that given the experience with the USA PATRIOT Act and many other abuses of power, Congress would be leery about giving this president his biggest blank check yet to suspend the Constitution. But that would be naïve. </p>
<p>The new law was put in place in response to the debacle of the federal response to Hurricane Katrina. There was no evidence that permitting a president far more power would avoid future debacles, but such a law provides a comfort blanket to politicians. The risk of tyranny is irrelevant compared with the reduction of risk of embarrassment to politicians. According to Washington, the correct response to Katrina is not to recognize the failure of relying on federal agencies a thousand miles away but rather to vastly increase the power of the president to dictate a solution, regardless of whether he knows what he is doing and regardless of whether local and state rights are trampled. </p>
<p>The new law also empowers the president to commandeer the National Guard of one state to send to another state for as many as 365 days. Bush could send the South Carolina National Guard to suppress anti-war protests in New Haven. Or the next president could send the Massachusetts National Guard to disarm the residents of Wyoming, if they resisted a federal law that prohibited private ownership of semi-automatic weapons. Governors’ control of the National Guard can be trumped with a simple presidential declaration. </p>
<p>Section 1076 had bipartisan support on Capitol Hill, including support from Sen. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Sen. John Warner (R-Va.), Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), and Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.), chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. Since the law would give the feds more power, it was very popular inside the Beltway. </p>
<p>On the other hand, every governor in the country opposed the changes. Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, warned on September 19, 2006, that “we certainly do not need to make it easier for presidents to declare martial law.” Leahy’s alarm got no response. Ten days later, he commented in the Congressional Record, “Using the military for law enforcement goes against one of the founding tenets of our democracy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>(Italics mine)</p>
<p>A lot of people are very selective about what they see as government coercion and as justifiable intervention, whether it be taxes, policing, spying, financial regulations, school.  In any economic or government model and/or policy, the questions need answering that eventually affect our personal lives.  Many form their arguments around a &#8216;big or small&#8217; hypotheses, but also there appears a lot of variablity about what areas are subject to the notion of &#8216;big or small&#8217;, or &#8216;centralized or diversified&#8217;.</p>
<p>In our discussions we tend to fragment these arguments as if they are not connected to each other.  I fail to see how a liberal like me and a National Rifle member could disagree that this form of possible coercion is wrong.  So why are we quiet?<br />End</p>
