                                <p>Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/04/score-one-for-obama.html">Greg Mankiw</a> comes a discussion by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/us/politics/29campaign.html?partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss&#038;pagewanted=all">John Broder</a>.  Greg scores this for Obama and adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>I don&#8217;t know any prominent economist who favors this McCain-Clinton proposal. More common is the reaction of a friend of mine (a veteran of the Clinton administration) who calls the idea &#8220;ludicrous.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Broder reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton lined up with Senator John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, in endorsing a plan to suspend the federal excise tax on gasoline, 18.4 cents a gallon, for the summer travel season. But Senator Barack Obama, Mrs. Clinton’s Democratic rival, spoke out firmly against the proposal, saying it would save consumers little and do nothing to curtail oil consumption and imports. While Mr. Obama’s view is shared by environmentalists and many independent energy analysts, his position allowed Mrs. Clinton to draw a contrast with her opponent in appealing to the hard-hit middle-class families and older Americans who have proven to be the bedrock of her support. She has accused Mr. Obama of being out of touch with ordinary Americans who are struggling to meet their mortgages and gas up their cars and trucks … Mrs. Clinton said the tax on the oil companies, which have been reporting record profits as oil prices soar, would cover all of the lost revenue from the federal tax on gasoline and diesel fuel. She also said no highway projects would suffer.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some economists have argued that the incidence of the tax break would go entirely to the oil companies so Senator Clinton’s remark that Senator Obama is “out of touch with ordinary Americans” is just silly.  But we should add that this view of the incidence of the tax break would suggest that consumers would not consume more gasoline.  Another view is that the incidence is evenly split between consumers and suppliers, which would imply that the consumer would get a whooping $0.09 per gallon off of his gasoline bill as the oil companies get the other $0.09 a gallon.  OK, but as Greg notes this means we’ll be consuming more imported oil and adding to pollution.  Plus the fact that this tax holiday would add to the Federal debt.</p>
<p>But didn’t the Clinton version of the McCain gasoline tax holiday promise to make up for the lost tax revenues by taxing the oil companies?  OK, then we should again think about the incidence of the tax question.  How much of Clinton’s tax on the oil companies would be passed onto consumers?  Talk about being out of touch!</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/29/gas-tax-follies">Paul Krugman</a> comments on the McCain-Clinton “gas tax follies”:</p>
<blockquote><p>John McCain has a really bad idea on gasoline, Hillary Clinton is emulating him (but with a twist that makes her plan pointless rather than evil), and Barack Obama, to his credit, says no … The McCain gas tax plan is a giveaway to oil companies, disguised as a gift to consumers.  Is the supply of gasoline really fixed? For this coming summer, it is … The Clinton twist is that she proposes paying for the revenue loss with an excess profits tax on oil companies. In one pocket, out the other. So it’s pointless, not evil. But it is pointless, and disappointing.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>K harris suggests we try these rules out in our discussions about global warming: (lifted from comments cactus style)</p>
<p>Just a few rules of thumb for discussion like this one &#8211; discussion in which we mere mortals are left dealing with data that has been collected from places we can&#8217;t go, interpreted through methods we can&#8217;t replicate, and in which factions have hardened up considerably &#8211; </p>
<p>1. If you can correctly guess the basic stance that some member of the discussion will take toward a new bit of news, then that person isn&#8217;t really addressing the new information. That person is merely taking the opportunity of some new event or datum to repeat a position you already know, rather than taking the event or datum as it comes and opening themselves to new implictions. </p>
<p>2. Assertions that the public, or the majority of the public, holds certain views on an issue, in the absence of evidence, don&#8217;t mean beans. We may not be able to interpret millions of temperature data in any useful way, but most of us can read poll results. No results? No valid claim to know how the public feels about an issue.</p>
<p>3. In issues that are going to be settled through some political process, the views of the public matter. In matters of fact, public views tell you nothing except whether the public is well or ill informed. In matters of science, the public view may have somewhat more interesting socialogical implications, but has no relevance to whether science has the correct answer. </p>
<p>4. Keynes was right about the long run. Whenever you are assured all will be well in the long-run, ask yourself whether that assurance fits in with the bias of the speaker. If so, refer to item 1.</p>
<p>5. When one side of a debate has to fall back on attributing unsavory motives to the other side, it is fair to guess that the accuser doesn&#8217;t have anything else to fall back on. Unless there is a body of evidence that one side has unsavory motives, as in the following case:</p>
<p>6. Now that we know about the tobacco industry&#8217;s place in the &#8220;junk science&#8221; movement, there is more reason than ever to be sceptical of sceptics who profit from their position. Ther junk science movement has also demonstrated that professional sceptics can mislead very effectively, so that their story will be repeated by those with no material interest in the argument. That is a measure of the success of propoganda, and reason to resist it all the more.</p>
<p>The overwhelming consensus among specialists in climate-related research is that human activity has resulted in an increased retention of heat in earth&#8217;s atmosphere. It is a really good idea to debate these issues, but it is just plain dishonest to suggest that the people who are best able to understand this issue think man-made global warming is bunk.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=why_populists_need_to_rethink_trade">James Galbraith</a> discusses trade and wages in The American Prospect.  It is best to read the whole article before commenting to make sure I am not leaving something out.  I have to run this morning.</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, rather than being spooked by the supposed effect of trade on wages, let&#8217;s consider how that relationship works when you take it the other way around. What is the effect of wages on trade? Suppose that instead of building a trade policy to help with wages, we built a wages policy to help with trade. Does that sound far-fetched? It isn&#8217;t. If you did that, you would have what economists call the Scandinavian Model.</p>
<p>The Scandinavian countries are egalitarian. They have universal unions, high minimum wages, and a strong welfare state. But they also are highly open. They practice free trade. Business there is free to import, export, and outsource. Business there is free to hire and fire. And yet the Scandinavians enjoy, most of the time, the lowest unemployment rates in Europe.</p>
<p>The secret is in the wages. If you are a business in Sweden or Norway, there is one thing you are not free to do. You are not free to cut your wages. You are not free to compete by going after cut-rate workers, either native or immigrant. You are not free to undercut the union rate. Successful businesses must, therefore, find other ways to compete. They do it by keeping productivity high. This means that advanced industries thrive in Scandinavia, while backward ones die out. (And that progressive businessmen prosper, while reactionaries fade away.) As a result, the economies stay competitive. The tax and welfare systems then make sure that everyone has enough to live on.</p>
<p>We are not Sweden or Norway &#8212; we are much larger and will always be much more diverse &#8212; but the economic principles are exactly the same. And we have, in fact, applied them in the past. As Dorgan and Brown correctly state in their essay, this is how the American middle class got built in the first place. It was done through unions, laws, regulations and, yes, standards. But the standards weren&#8217;t imposed on other people. They were imposed at home, where they can be enforced &#8212; and the rest of the world adjusted to what we did here. The problem, in short, is not foreigners and trade. The big problem is simply that unions, laws, regulations, and standards have been undercut by conservative policymakers, right here at home.</p>
<p>In certain industries, with advanced technologies and strong unions (think aircraft, or telecommunications), high wages persist. Yet those sectors remain competitive. This is how the model works &#8212; high wages mean that business has no alternative but to stay on its competitive toes. We can, if we choose, spread that model more widely. How? Let&#8217;s start with a higher minimum wage, a union-friendly workplace, universal health care, and stricter corporate governance. Let’s pass the Employee Free Choice Act. And let&#8217;s have enough new credit and research support to create the new industries that the future &#8212; especially the environmental demands of a changing planet &#8212; will require.</p>
<p>Will we lose some jobs to trade? Sure. But unlike the Scandinavians, we don&#8217;t have to balance our current account. Given the dollar&#8217;s global position, we can improve our living standards, our productivity, and our competitive position &#8212; and still run a substantial trade deficit. For now.</p>
<p>This is a reality-based populism. Our goal should be shared prosperity through egalitarian growth, based on our own efforts and imagination. Let&#8217;s therefore stop scapegoating the Mexicans and the Chinese, and accept that they must have their role, which they will largely determine by their own actions, in the world in which we all live. Let&#8217;s also stop talking obsessively about trade agreements with tiny countries that don&#8217;t really matter much.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s concentrate, instead, on getting things right for workers right here. Let&#8217;s raise wages, create jobs, support unions, deliver services &#8212; and especially, let&#8217;s cut the inequalities in our structure of pay.</p>
<p>If we do that, one still can&#8217;t guarantee that our trade position will come out all right in the end. But based on the economics and the politics, it&#8217;s probably our best shot.</p>

<p>Update: Here is a link to a back and forth of two economists on <a href="http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?article=trade_war">&#8216;Trade War&#8217;</a>.  The write ups are much more than the little bit quoted here, but I think DolB has the right direction for thinking.</p>

From the latter article:</p>
<blockquote><p>Like most of the world&#8217;s poorest nations, Mauritania is caught in a global food trap, producing only 30 percent of what its people eat and importing most of the rest. As prices skyrocket, those who can least afford it are squeezed the most as the world confronts the worst bout of food inflation since the Soviet grain crisis of the 1970s. Strong global demand and limited supplies are key factors driving up prices, but perhaps just as important is a massive disruption in the free flow of global trade. In recent months, food-producing countries from Argentina to Kazakhstan have begun to slam shut their doors to protect domestic access to the food they grow. Agriculturally challenged countries are left out in the cold.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Tyler argues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The damage that trade restrictions cause is probably most evident in the case of rice. Although rice is the major foodstuff for about half of the world, it is highly protected and regulated. Only about 5 to 7 percent of the world’s rice production is traded across borders; that’s unusually low for an agricultural commodity. So when the price goes up — indeed, many varieties of rice have roughly doubled in price since 2007 — this highly segmented market means that the trade in rice doesn’t flow to the places of highest demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dani, however, objects:</p>
<blockquote><p>Cowen argues that freer trade in food commodities such as rice would boost global supplies and help reduce prices.  He is probably right about the first, but not about the second. The effect of freer trade on domestic food prices depends on whether a country is a food importer or exporter.  Freer trade would reduce prices of food (relative to other prices) only in countries that are food importers.  Food exporters would experience a rise in the relative price of food, and there is simply no way of escaping that reality.  Trade works by relieving the relative scarcity of goods.  The key here is the term &#8220;relative.&#8221;  Food importing countries are food scarce countries, and as they open up to trade, the relative price of food falls.  But if you are Thailand or Argentina, where other goods are scarce relative to food, freer trade means higher relative prices of food, not lower.  And all the induced efficiency benefits and short- vs. long-run effects that Cowen talks about have no bearing on this conclusion: in the end some countries have to be net importers, and others net exporters.</p></blockquote>
<p>From the former piece by Faiola:</p>
<blockquote><p>As prices rose, major grain producers including Argentina and Ukraine, battling inflation caused in part by soaring oil bills, were moving to bar exports on a range of crops to control costs at home. It meant less supply on world markets even as global demand entered a fundamentally new phase. Already, corn prices had been climbing for months on the back of booming government-subsidized ethanol programs. Soybeans were facing pressure from surging demand in China. But as supplies in the pipelines of global trade shrank, prices for corn, soybeans, wheat, oats, rice and other grains began shooting through the roof.</p></blockquote>
<p>In addition to some very good reporting from Mr. Faiola, it is nice to see a reporter get the economics right as well.</p>

<p>I was just thinking maybe the solution to some health care costs is less insurance, not more. I have health insurance via an HMO, but I often choose to go outside of the HMO. When I pay cash at time of service I am offered a 30% (!) discount. What gives?</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120813453964211685.html?mod=djemEditorialPage">An opinion in the WSJ</a> asks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most discussions about the rising cost of health care emphasize the need to get more people insured. The assumption seems to be that insurance – rather than the service delivered by doctor to patient – is the important commodity.<br />But perhaps the solution to much of what currently plagues us in health care – rising costs and bureaucracy, diminishing levels of service – rests on a radically different approach: fewer people insured&#8230;<br />&#8230;<br />Insurance is all about betting against negative consequences and the insurance business model is unique in that profits depend upon goods and services not being provided. Using actuarial tables, insurers place their bets. Sometimes even the canniest MIT grads can&#8217;t help: Property and casualty insurers have collapsed in the wake of natural disasters.<br />Health insurers have taken steps to avoid that level of surprise: Once they affix themselves to the host – in this case dual hosts, both doctor and patient – they systematically suck the lifeblood out of the supply chain with obstructive strategies. For that reason, the consequences of any insurance-based health-care model, be it privately run, or a government entitlement, are painfully easy to predict. There will be progressively draconian rationing using denial of authorization and steadily rising co-payments on the patient end; massive paperwork and other bureaucratic hurdles, and steadily diminishing fee-recovery on the doctor end.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I’ve lifted the expression <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/04/paul-krugman-bu.html">Mark Thoma</a> used when offering us the latest from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/28/opinion/28krugman.html?ex=1367035200&#038;en=e662b828678cf213&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink">Paul Krugman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the 2000 campaign people said much the same thing about Mr. Bush; those of us who looked hard at his policy proposals, especially on taxes, saw the shape of things to come.  And a look at what Mr. McCain says about taxes shows the same combination of irresponsibility and double-talk that, back in 2000, foreshadowed the character of the Bush administration.  The McCain tax plan contains three main elements.  First, Mr. McCain proposes making almost all of the Bush tax cuts, which are currently scheduled to expire at the end of 2010, permanent. (He proposes reinstating the inheritance tax, albeit at a very low rate.)  Second, he wants to eliminate the alternative minimum tax, which was originally created to prevent the wealthy from exploiting tax loopholes, but has begun to hit the upper middle class.<br />Third, he wants to sharply reduce tax rates on corporate profits. According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, the overall effect of the McCain tax plan would be to reduce federal revenue by more than $5 trillion over 10 years. That’s a lot of revenue loss — enough to pose big problems for the government’s solvency.<br />But before I get to that, let’s look at what I found truly revealing: the McCain campaign’s response to the Tax Policy Center’s assessment. The response, written by Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the former head of the Congressional Budget Office, criticizes the center for adopting “unrealistic Congressional budgeting conventions.” What’s that about?  Well, Congress “scores” tax legislation by comparing estimates of the revenue that would be collected if the legislation passed with estimates of the revenue that would be collected under current law. In this case that means comparing the McCain plan with what would happen if the Bush tax cuts expired on schedule.<br />Mr. Holtz-Eakin wants the McCain plan compared, instead, with “current policy” — which he says means maintaining tax rates at today’s levels. But here’s the thing: the reason the Bush tax cuts are set to expire is that the Bush administration engaged in a game of deception. It put an expiration date on the tax cuts, which it never intended to honor, as a way to hide those tax cuts’ true cost. The McCain campaign wants us to accept the success of that deception as a fact of life. Mr. Holtz-Eakin is saying, in effect, “We’re not engaged in any new irresponsibility — we’re just perpetuating the Bush administration’s irresponsibility. That doesn’t count.” It’s the sort of fiscal double-talk that has been a Bush administration hallmark. In any case, it offers no answer to the principal point raised by the Tax Policy Center analysis, which has nothing to do with scoring: the McCain tax plan would leave the federal government with far too little revenue to cover its expenses, leading to huge budget deficits unless there were deep cuts in spending.<br />And Mr. McCain has said nothing realistic about how he would close the giant budget gap his tax cuts would produce — a gap so large that eliminating it would require cutting Social Security benefits by three-quarters, eliminating Medicare, or something equivalently drastic. Talking, as Mr. Holtz-Eakin does, about fighting waste and reforming procurement doesn’t cut it.</p></blockquote>
<p>When Paul noted in 2000 similar reservations about the things George W. Bush was saying, he was labeled the Shrill One.  Now a lot of his former critics on the right – people with integrity such as Bruce Bartlett and Andrew Sullivan – have joined Paul in their shrillnees.  Paul also tries to balance this off with criticisms of the Democrats:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, Mr. McCain isn’t unique in making promises he has no way to pay for — the same can be said, to some extent, of the Democratic candidates. But Mr. McCain’s plan is far more irresponsible than anything the Democrats are proposing, and the difference in degree is so large as to be a difference in kind. Mr. McCain’s budget talk simply doesn’t make sense.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I said <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/democratic-promises-and-lack-of-fiscal.html">something simlar</a>, a few AB readers wanted me to compare the fiscal irresponsibility of McCain v. the Democrats.  Paul says McCain’s is larger but has not put forth a quantitative side-by-side scoring of the fiscal proposals of each of these candidates.  If someone does perform a credible analysis for all three candidates – let us know.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/04/the-death-of-fi.html">Andrew Sullivan</a> says the CBO has come through:</p>
<blockquote><p>According to the CBO, McCain&#8217;s plan is the most fiscally damaging &#8230; the proposals by Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Barack Obama, the impact of either on the deficit would be less than one-third that of the McCain plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>My only complaint here is that Andrew calls fiscal irresponsibility a leftist view.  I’ll admit it ain’t fiscal conservatism but this liberal is a member of the deficit hawk wing of the Democratic Party.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Last Friday Arnold Kling at <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/">Econlog</a> and Russell Roberts at <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2008/04/families-and-pe.htmlry">Cafehayek</a> commented on  Larry Bartels book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Unequal-Democracy-Political-Economy-Foundation/dp/0691136637/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1209122550&#038;sr=8-1/marginalrevol-20">Unequal Democracy</a> and I made some comments<br />about what they were saying.</p>
<p>Bartels used family income data in his book and both Arnold and Russell ignored this point and went into long discussion about why household income data is so distorted that the comparisons in Unequal Democracy were meaningless. Both Arnold and Russell are correct  that the rapid growth in single women households over recent decades is a significant factor behind recent changes in poverty and this growth in single mothers and divorced women does impact the data.  But GMU libertarians are not the only ones that know the household data is distorted by the growth in single women households.  The Census Bureau where the data originates and Bartels are well aware of these problems. That is why  Census also publishes data on family income and why Bartel used family income data in his book.</p>
<p>I suspect neither Arnold nor Russell have ever looked at the data to see how the growth of single women families has impacted the data.  Rather they have heard someone use these criticisms of the data and just started used it because it agreed with their priors.  But the data is readily available at Census.</p>
<p>First, what has happened to family income growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SBOCY3gv8II/AAAAAAAAAOI/fOZpgZaa26g/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SBOCY3gv8II/AAAAAAAAAOI/fOZpgZaa26g/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>As the chart shows there was a sharp slowdown in family income growth sometime in the late 1970s. The trend growth rate of real family income slowed from 2.8% from 1950 to 1980 to only<br />0.8% from 1975 to 2005.  The more recent growth rate was only 30% of the old trend  and if the old trend growth had continued family income would have been 177% higher in 2005.</p>
<p>So what happened to married couples real income.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SBOChXgv8JI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/pMkeJwFwZMY/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SBOChXgv8JI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/pMkeJwFwZMY/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Married couples &#8212; including both families where the wife worked and where the wife stayed home &#8212; experienced a very similar slowdown in real income growth from a trend growth rate of 2.8% from 1950 to 1980  to only a  1.1% trend after 1975&#8211; the new trend is 40% of the old one  If the old trend  for married couples had continued their real income would have been 172% larger in 2005.</p>
<p>Now Russell Roberts argues that the growth in single women households distorted the data so severely that one could not make meaningful comparisons.  But that does not look right to me.<br />It is very easy to see that the growth of single person household had a modest impact on real family income growth.  Essentially, it is responsible for the fact that since 1975 real family income growth was 0.8% and married couples real income growth rate was 1.1%.  This 0.3 percentage point impact from the growth in single person families clearly does not look like such a sever distortion that comparisons are meaningless. Moreover,  the point that total family income would have been 177% higher and married couples income would have been 172% higher if the old trends continued does not look like such a sever distortion that no one can make meaningful comparisons. A five percentage point difference over 30 years does not look like a massive distortion that makes comparisons meaningless.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure what else to do with this information. I&#8217;m sure that both Arnold and Russell heard this criticism at some right wing think tanks or blog and just picked it up without ever thinking about it. But too many people at right wing think tanks are paid to put out research that supports a point of view that one can not trust their research conclusions. The growth in single person households sounds dramatic and it could be very easy to accept someone quoting this data when they conclude that the income data is unrealistic.   But as they say down home, if you lay down with dogs you get fleas.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m curious about is what happens to the sharp 18 year old undergraduate at GMU that recognizes that  their professors are dissembling and does not buy into their ideological distortions. I sure hope these professors do not grade on the basis of their students ideological purity.</p>

                                <p>There is no excuse for <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=NjUxOTQ0MWYyZWM3ZjI3MWE3ODE1YzEwYTY5MWNlOGM=">this</a> &#8211; more after the background.  When I heard the verdict in the trial of the three NYC policemen who shot 50 bullets and killed <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/04/26/sean.bell.trial/index.html">Sean Bell</a>, my fear was that NYC would suffer what LA suffered after a similar verdict in the trial of the policemen who beat <a href="http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/la_riot/article/0,28804,1614117_1614084,00.html">Rodney King</a>.  So far, we have not seen any riots – just a lot of calls for such police brutality to never occur again.  </p>
<p>Kathryn Jean Lopez entitled her Corner comment “Kill the Police”.  OK, that was not her plea.  No – she decided to attack Al Sharpton as if Reverend Sharpton was advocating NYC’s version of the LA riots that followed the verdicts in the Rodney King incident.  But read <a href="http://apnews.myway.com/article/20080426/D909P8SG0.html">the story</a> that KLo links to in her baseless allegation.  Sharpton was calling for civil protests not violence.  It was bystanders who made that awful chant “kill the police” and not Sharpton and those in his march.  So KLo was not exactly being honest.  And as a resident of NYC, I resent that she titles anything with such a charged sentence.  My city is handling this well so far – perhaps because those who were outraged by the not guilty verdict don’t bother to read the stupidity that permeates the National Review.</p>

<p>You cannot rely on the US media.  The media in general sustains the cultural mendacity engulfing the military industrial complex.</p>
<p>April 23, 2008,  Seattle Post-Intelligencer<br />Dicks, Tiahrt &#8216;Porkers Of The Month&#8217; Over Tanker<br />By Eric Rosenberg, P-I Washington Bureau<br />
<blockquote>“WASHINGTON &#8212; A government watchdog group gave its wry &#8220;Porkers of the Month&#8221; award Tuesday to Reps. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., and Todd Tiahrt, R-Kan., for their support of The Boeing Co.&#8217;s efforts to build Air Force tanker planes.<br />The nonpartisan group, Citizens Against Government Waste, said Dicks and Tiahrt won the porkers moniker &#8212; which refers to pork-barrel federal spending &#8212; because they have threatened congressional action to cancel the Air Force tanker contract won by a Boeing rival, a team of Airbus-parent EADS and Northrop Grumman.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Citizens Against Government Waste has a recondite concept of waste.  Googling Citizens Against Government Waste, you will find their issue is that Dicks and Taihrt are keeping the Renton Washington, USA, Boeing 767 line running, while the lower to no pork approach to building a useless aerial refueling tanker includes keeping the plant at Toulouse, France running but conceiving a  risky assembly facility in Mobile is not called pork.</p>
<p>Pork for Northrop, France and a little bit for Mobile Al. is okay, while keeping the effective long serving Boeing fabrication and assembly in the US is pork.  The gall!</p>
<p>More references to Citizens Against Governemnt Waste show they get most of their funding from corporations and their issues are primarily for big business.</p>
<p>There are always two sides to an issue and the failure to see the issue as ‘whittling a beak’ shows that Citizens Against Government Waste are not what their title implies.  Somewhere the corporate donor list has a shade of Northrop and Airbus.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
