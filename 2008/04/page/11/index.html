<blockquote><p>The Fed, the Treasury, and the G7 may have discovered that the U.S. peso (a.k.a. “the dollar”) has been falling and world inflation is rising … Okay, so the big boys are finally focused on the sinking greenback and the resulting worldwide inflation pressure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dollar devaluation does lead to higher import prices for the US, which may have a minor impact on consumer prices.  But the flip side of this coin is that other currencies appreciate with respect to the dollar, which would translate into lower import prices for other nations.  But hey – let’s see what the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2008/01/pdf/tables.pdf">IMF</a> is forecasting for inflation for 2008 and 2009.   Table A5 indicates that the “advanced economies” and the “emerging and developing economies” may see inflation briefly rise during 2008 only to decline in 2009.   Not exactly the hyperinflation story that Kudlow is pushing.  </p>
<p>If one turns to table A.1, one can see that the IMF is worried that real GDP growth will slow.  Kudlow seems to be arguing we should adopt a tighter monetary policy, which will not only make the world GDP slowdown worse but could indeed lead to dollar appreciation and even a larger US current account deficit.  I sure hope that no one at the G7 conference listens to the policy advice of this Klown.<br />END</p>

                                <p>When will the New York Times put an end to this kind of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/14/opinion/14kristol.html?_r=2&#038;ex=1365912000&#038;en=31f1f15c03188cec&#038;ei=5088&#038;partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">stupidity</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>My occasion for spending a little time once again with the old Communist was Barack Obama’s now-famous comment at an April 6 San Francisco fund-raiser. Obama was explaining his trouble winning over small-town, working-class voters: “It’s not surprising then that they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren’t like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.” This sent me to Marx’s famous statement about religion in the introduction to his “Contribution to the Critique of Hegel’s Philosophy of Right”: “Religious suffering is at the same time an expression of real suffering and a protest against real suffering. Religion is the sigh of the oppressed creature, the sentiment of a heartless world, and the soul of a soulless condition. It is the opium of the people.” Or, more succinctly, and in the original German in which Marx somehow always sounds better: “Die Religion &#8230; ist das Opium des Volkes.” …  And it’s a particularly odd claim for Barack Obama to make. After all, in his speech at the 2004 Democratic convention, he emphasized with pride that blue-state Americans, too, “worship an awesome God.” What’s more, he’s written eloquently in his memoir, “Dreams From My Father,” of his own religious awakening upon hearing the Rev. Jeremiah Wright’s “Audacity of Hope” sermon, and of the complexity of his religious commitment. You’d think he’d do other believers the courtesy of assuming they’ve also thought about their religious beliefs. But Obama in San Francisco does no courtesy to his fellow Americans. Look at the other claims he makes about those small-town voters.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have to give another hat tip to <a href="http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2008/04/now-hes-a-godle.html">Andrew Sullivan</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Bill Kristol, trained in the same politics as Hillary Clinton, now argues that Obama&#8217;s remarks in a fundraiser q and a are the &#8220;real Obama&#8221; &#8211; and that his voluminous writing and speaking about the sincerity of his own religious faith, and of others, are presumably &#8220;masks.&#8221; &#8230; Is this indistinguishable from saying, along with Marx, that all religion is an obviously false consciousness caused by the alienation of the world-historical class struggle? No, it obviously isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s saying that economic distress does often in human history express itself in more rigid forms of religion, more reactionary cultural identification, less tolerance of &#8220;the other.&#8221; Since large swathes of human history have shown this to be true &#8211; and perfectly arguable without any materialist understanding of religion &#8211; Kristol is deliberately distorting to paint Obama as a cynical manipulator of religious faith for political ends, rather than as a genuine Christian. He&#8217;s calling him a lying, Godless communist.  You could argue, as Kristol and others hilariously will, that Lou Dobbs has no base, that fundamentalist Christianism has no problem with &#8220;the other&#8221; in a globalized world, that dozens of state constitutional amendments banning civil marriages that had never and would never have taken place were just spirited forms of civic engagement, rather than scapegoating or politicking on resentment. You could also argue, as others legitimately will, that spasms of economic distress and social discontent are unconnected. Hey: Weimar had nothing to do with Hitler. But Kristol is doing something much more pernicious: he is saying that Obama is faking faith, that his very profession of faith is a &#8220;mask&#8221; that is slipping, and that Kristol is the person to determine whose faith is genuine and who is a fraud.  A non-Christian manipulator of Christianity is calling a Christian a liar about his own faith. That&#8217;s where they&#8217;ve gone to already. And it&#8217;s only the middle of April. What are they so scared of?</p></blockquote>
<p>Thank you Andrew!  With that – the only thing left to say is that it is time that the New York Times end their experiment with Kristol.  The man is almost as partisan as he is worthless.<br />END</p>

<p><strong>The Downside of Increased Trade</strong></p>
<p>My wife, aka the world&#8217;s greatest nurse, worked this weekend. She spent a great deal of her time trying to track down enough Heparin to keep a patient alive this week. This is ridiculous. She had twenty-three frail elderly people to care for, and shouldn&#8217;t be tracking down routine medications.</p>
<p>There have been multiple recalls of Heparin since January, when it became clear that Heparin imported from China by Baxter was causing strange and often deadly reactions.</p>
<p>Initially, the Chinese said that if Baxter was having problems, it was Baxter&#8217;s problem. After the stuff hit the fan the Chinese have relented somewhat.</p>
<p>It is reported that Chinese pharma manufacturers are registering aa chemical manufacturers to avoid inspections, although it appears the embarrassed Chinese government and the FDA are tracking them down.</p>
<p>China is quickly becoming THE major source for generic drugs, patent drugs, and raw materials for other drug makers.</p>
<p>How much risk will you take to get $4 generic prescriptions?</p>

                                <p>There hasn&#8217;t been much written about what the one cabinet-level secretary with the word &#8220;housing&#8221; in his title did as the housing bubble grew and grew and grew and then burst.  Steve Benen has a post on <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/15202.html">that</a>.  I don&#8217;t have anything to add, but I would like to simply repeat what Benen himself wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hmm, why does this sound so familiar?</p></blockquote>
<p>Note&#8230; there is no more to this post.  I don&#8217;t seem to be able to keep it from writing &#8220;Read more&#8221; at the bottom of the post.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Alphonso, not Alphonse, in the title.  Sorry.</p>

<blockquote><p> It has been more than ten years now since PNAC first introduced itself by way of its letter to Clinton. Over this decade, PNAC&#8217;s ideology and foreign policy mandates became the center of gravity for America&#8217;s military and diplomatic practices and priorities. Those same PNAC members listed above were instrumental in the formulation of false arguments for an attack and invasion of Iraq, and for the execution of same. <br />    To many, the current situation in Iraq represents a prime example of the folly and failures of George W. Bush and his administration. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. From the PNAC perspective, their presence within US government and control over US policy has been a great success. They achieved the massive increase in military spending they sought in 2000, much of which became and continues to be a multi-billion dollar payout to friends and political allies. They have their permanent bases in Iraq. And if the tea leaves are being read correctly, they might just get an attack on Iran, which represents one more step towards their goal of region-wide regime change in the Middle East.</p>
<p>    Ten years on, the Project is doing quite nicely, thank you. Failure is only in the eye of the beholder, and if the beholder is getting everything he wants with a tidy payday to boot, &#8220;failure&#8221; is not what they are going to see. As far as PNAC is concerned, this has been a decade filled with astonishing achievements. In other words, it&#8217;s all about priorities and perspective&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>PNAC alumni.<br />    Among these were: </p>
<p>Bush&#8217;s current vice president, Dick Cheney; </p>
<p>Cheney&#8217;s former chief of staff, I. Lewis &#8220;Scooter&#8221; Libby; </p>

                                <p>There&#8217;s a graph I put up a few times, and it always leads to comments and e-mails from folks on the right.  Its this one, showing growth rates in real GDP per capita over the length of each Presidency starting with Ike:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdfdumL6I/AAAAAAAAA80/yYHmZlEFR2A/s1600-h/dynamic+scoring+-+real+GDP+per+capita+graph.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdfdumL6I/AAAAAAAAA80/yYHmZlEFR2A/s320/dynamic+scoring+-+real+GDP+per+capita+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The response  goes more or less as follows:</p>
<p>1.  JFK and LBJ presided over fast growth because JFK cut taxes and because the rest of the world hadn&#8217;t caught up to America&#8217;s manufacturing engine.<br />2.  Carter didn&#8217;t really produce growth.  The figures must be mistaken.<br />3.  Clinton was just lucky to be President at a time when the dot com boom happened.  Plus there was the Republican Revolution.</p>
<p>Now, the problem with 1. is that the JFK tax cuts actually weren&#8217;t JFK tax cuts, they were LBJ tax cuts in JFK&#8217;s name, pushed through in 1964, so they can&#8217;t possibly explain 1961, 1962, or 1963.  And the cut in tax rates seemed to produce a very different effect during the LBJ years than under the Reagan or GW years &#8211; much, much faster real growth, and a shrinking debt to boot.   And BTW, the issue of the debt matters a lot &#8211; Government spending is a component of GDP, so you can push up GDP by pulling a Reagan, namely having the government explode the deficit and spending the money, leaving a bill for one&#8217;s successors.</p>
<p>As to the bit about the rest of the world catching up&#8230;  was the US&#8217; position relative to the rest of the world so much different from 1961 to 1968 than it had been in the eight years prior, or the eight years following?  Seriously? </p>
<p>As to Carter&#8230; his last year in office was awful.  He inherited a mess &#8211; inflation, disco, and an energy crisis being among the chief problems &#8211; but there was pretty solid growth during his first three years.  His last year in office wasn&#8217;t so hot, but even with that, he did better than all but LBJ, JFK, Clinton and Reagan.  </p>
<p>Then we get to Clinton.  His fiscal responsibility is credited to Newt and the dot com boom, despite the fact that receipts started rising in 1993 (think tax hikes) and outlays started falling the same year, long before the Republican Revolution or the dot com boom took off.  (Pictures <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-receipts-outlays.html">here</a> &#8211; take a look, its a pretty linear trend.) </p>
<p>So the conclusion we are supposed to reach is that four out of the top five administrations when it comes to growth in real GDP per capita since 1953 were aberrations of some sort, that if it weren&#8217;t for random circumstances, or had they not followed the Republican mantra, they would have grown much slower.  </p>
<p>Its easier for some people to assume that every single one of the Democrats in the sample was an aberration of some sort than to assume that Ronald Reagan, the only Republican among the top five, was the aberration.  </p>
<p>Of course, the implication of this is obvious &#8211; unless every single one of the Republicans other than Reagan was an aberration too, the growth rate in real GDP per capita we should expect to see, on average, is more similar to the one produced by the red bars on the right side of the graph than that produced by the blue bars on the left side of the graph.  Don&#8217;t these people realize, as Ronald Reagan himself told us in his <a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=43130">first inaugural address</a>, that &#8220;we&#8217;re too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams&#8221;?  Of course, if we&#8217;re going to achieve bigger dreams, we need to have realistic plans, not just plans based on erroneous assumptions that history has shown, over and over, will not work.<br />END</p>

                                <p>ILSM looks at the deficit, and has some fun with the &#8220;Skeptical Optimist&#8221; in the process&#8230;</p>
<p>Last year, the <a href="http://www.optimist123.com/optimist/2007/05/deficit_watch_m.html">&#8220;Skeptical Optimist&#8221;</a> had suggested the deficit could be zero by April 2008. In March it was around $79B.</p>
<p>I suppose one could not see that the housing bubble would deflate so precipitously.</p>
<p>As of 31 Mar 2008, <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/pd/feddebt/feddebt_mar08.pdf">these</a> were the figures: </p>
<p>Publicly held debt: $5,334B  Inc: $74B<br />Intragov Debt:  $4,089B  Inc: $5B</p>
<p>It seems the US debt increased by $79B in Mar 2008.<br />Top 5 Intragov Debt Accounts:</p>
<p>SSTF  $2,054B<br />Civil Service<br />Retirement  $685B<br />Medicare:  $324B<br />Mil Retirement  $220B<br />SSA Disability   $215B<br />FDIC Deposit Insurance $48.4B For Closing banks!</p>

<p>One note by cactus.  I don&#8217;t wander by the Skeptical Optimist site often.  Still, something I noticed&#8230;  I understand why he might call himself an optimist, but the &#8220;skeptical&#8221; part I just don&#8217;t see.  I really don&#8217;t.    </p>

<blockquote><p>OLBERMANN:  If John 100 Years McCain wants to claim that he would only stay that long if troops finally start getting the flowers we were promised five years ago, does that not oblige him to say how long he‘s willing to stay while they keep shooting at us?  <br />ROBINSON:  There you go again being logical, Keith.  I talked to you about this in the past.  You know, look, right now, American troops are being wounded, harmed, injured, and killed, OK?  I think those were his four criteria.  So therefore by his logic, we shouldn‘t be there, right?  If we‘re only going to be in Iraq for this century, if there were just flowers being tossed at us everywhere, well, then why are we there now?  There‘s just something—it‘s just completely kind of wacky about the whole thing.  <br />OLBERMANN:  It sounds as if what he wants to do or the logical extension of his idea is to pull them out now and send them back in after everything calls down.  So if things in Iraq somehow magically reach the prosperousness, the stability of Japan or even the stability without prosperity in the Korean D.N.C., why would John 100 Years McCain want to stay there?  What is the scenario that requires both an American military presence there and makes it safe for our people there?  <br />ROBINSON:  I have no idea exactly what John Mc-Century means by that, Keith, but look, this is a good debate to have.  What is the proper role of permanent American military bases abroad?  Should we have one in Iraq?  Would that make the United States any safer?  I would argue that, you know, the long-term presence of large visible numbers of U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia did not make the United States safer demonstrably.  And I can‘t imagine a scenario under which that makes our country safer if we stay in Iraq for 100 years, you know, even if somehow we manage to turn it into Switzerland.  <br />OLBERMANN:  Right.  Given that al Qaeda had declared war on us because Bush senior put troops like that in Saudi Arabia.  Last point here, political strategy, the G.O.P. trying to scare the Democrats into not calling him John 100 Years McCain or Mc-Century, whatever.  Did he not open himself up to another interpretation of that nickname when Brit Hume defended him by saying he had a senior moment, when he himself said his choice for the vice presidency was especially important because of his own age.  Is there a little something extra in this?</p></blockquote>
<p>Eugene Robinson is truly a delight.  While the age thing was a little over the top – the John McCentury quip was perfect for Senator Let’s Stay in Iraq for 100 Years McCain.  And Robinson is correct – leaving US troops in a Muslim nation is exactly what Osama bin Laden is praying for.  Iraq 50 years ago will not be another Korea if John McCain’s strategy of leaving our troops there for a long time is maintained.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Twice now in this political session we have had the opportunity to move beyond the Carl Rove/Frank Luntz school and system of communication.  The first was Sen. Obama&#8217;s speech on race.  The second is this current statement discussed in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/bitter-comment-hillary-adopts-rovian.html">PGL&#8217;s post</a>.</p>
<p>I understand the current structure of our MSM and their strategy to earning viewers and thus money; stir the crap.  Even Olberman had one guest ask if the public was smart enough to understand Sen Obama&#8217;s speech on race as oppose to running after the handoff of the baton of: <em>Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, &#8220;Not this time.&#8221; This time we want to talk&#8230;</em></p>
<p>That was it.  The biggest opportunity to step out from the focus on the word or words and into the focus on the message the person speaking was attempting to relay.  Less emphysis on one&#8217;s interpretation of the words used and more focus on the interpretation used by the one you are communicating with for the sole purpose and desire to fully commune.  </p>
<p>This current statement by Obama is now the second opportunity for the US to step away with no penalty of loss of honor from the inward focus on the word/words into the outward focus on the message.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not really expecting the MSM to make the change.  Would be nice, but it will not happen until our elected ones make the change.  That Sen. Clinton did not and has not recognized these two opportunities and run with them is evidence of the lie of her political prowess.  She has failed to sense that the common thread in all of the “change” dialog regarding political change evolving into policy change is the cessation of the focusing on the word/words for the sake of winning the argument.  Such a focus is a selfish life approach.  </p>
<p>Our loss of respect in the world, our feelings of distrust, our decline of a sense of comfort, even the bank issue, the war, all of it began with shift to an approach of dialog of word/words.  Our dialog has been dominated for 3 decades by a style of communication that manifests out of selfishness.  It is the “lazy” in the presentation of the fat American, the me generation, the welfare queen, the illegal immigrant.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to focus on the word.  Every word has an emotional response and every emotional response has a physical response.  It is physiology.  Thus it is simple to generate a belief in one&#8217;s self that you are what I say you are and to feel good and confident in your righteousness.   It is the style of dialog one becomes engaged in when holding a conversation with another who is drunk or stoned, or high or manic, or schizophrenic or panicked or shocked.  It is the irony of the framing of Bush as being capable of relating because you could sit and have a beer with him.  You can.  You just won&#8217;t be able to communicate to any point of resolution.  With no ability to truly comprehend the message of the one you&#8217;re talking to, you have no ability to trust that person.  Consequently you have no ability to commune with that person.  In terms of economics, no ability to trade.</p>
<p>Sen. Clinton has shown twice now that she either: 1. does not understand this most basic of lessons of communication or 2. does understand, but for selfish intent will use it against those she professes a desire to serve or 3.  does understand, but has little faith or trust in those she professes a desire to serve.</p>
<p>With that, how would you advice Sen. Clinton to respond to Sen. Obama&#8217;s statements knowing that he put the following out there: <em>Or, at this moment, in this election, we can come together and say, &#8220;Not this time.&#8221; This time we want to talk&#8230;</em><br />END</p>
