<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/john-lott-looks-at-recessions-and.html">Cactus</a> catches the mendacity of <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,343671,00.html">John Lott</a> who appeared on Faux News.  Lott made two ridiculous claims which deserve to be attacked:</p>
<blockquote><p>A little perspective on the economy would be helpful. The average unemployment rate during President Clinton was 5.2 percent. The average under President George W. Bush is just slightly below 5.2 percent. The current unemployment rate is 4.8 percent, almost half a percentage point lower than these averages … The economy slowed down significantly during the end of last year, but that was after a sizzling annual GDP growth rate of 4.9 percent in the third quarter.</p></blockquote>
<p>The latter stands in contrast to Lott’s claim that 2000 was a recession year.  One of the many contributions made by Kash when he posted here was to graph the economic evidence.  I have struggled to make graphs that were in anyway close to what Kash produced, but let me suggest that the rebuttals from Cactus might be enhanced by a couple of graphs.  </p>
<p>Our first graph confirms the 4.9% increase (annualized) in real GDP for the third quarter of 2007 in contrast to the dip in real GDP during the third quarter of 2000.  But our graph shows that when comparing the other three quarters of these two years – 2000 dominated 2007.  Lott should know better than to argue growth was great in 2007 but was negative in 2000.  But then Lott chooses to mislead the viewers of Faux News.  I guess he thinks these viewers are just too stupid not to see through his mendacity.  </p>
<p>As far as his claims about the unemployment rate, it was 5.1% as of March 2007, which is significant higher than the 3.9% rate as of December 2000.  In January 1993, the unemployment rate was 7.3%.  Cactus correctly notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Put another way &#8211; it shrunk under Clinton, and rose under GW.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think John Lott owes the viewers of Faux News an apology for assuming that they are stupid little children who deserve to be lied to.<br />END</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The National Review has an article by <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MmUxZjE4YmJhOWQ2OGQ0NTcwMzJkNDYzNzIzNWEwYzA=">Fred Kagan</a>, one of the architects of the Surge and main cheerleaders of the war in Iraq.</p>
<p>He tells us:</p>
<blockquote><p>We will consider below just how much of a diversion of resources away from more desirable domestic priorities the Iraq war actually is, but the more important point is simply this: Unless the advocates of defeat can show, as they have not yet done, that the consequences of losing are very likely to be small not simply the day after the last American leaves Iraq, but over the next five, ten, and 50 years, then what they are really selling is short-term relief in exchange for long-term pain.</p></blockquote>
<p>Basically, his entire essay is framed as follows:<br />victory = doing what I want<br />defeat = doing something other than what I want</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s any other definition of victory and defeat in this rather lengthy piece, I haven&#8217;t seen it.</p>
<p>But even with this most favorable framing, he still has to ask for some extra help.  At no point does he suggest that proponents of his happy adventure should show what the consequences would be of sticking around 50 years out, or even that sticking around would ensure what he terms as victory.  </p>
<p>Back in the 1950s, some proto-Kagans came up with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Ajax">plan to achieve a certain kind of victory in Iran</a>.  They installed a vicious, kleptocratic, and inept leader.  Unfortunately, that meant that those who opposed tyranny also opposed those who kept that vicious, kleptocratic, and inept leader&#8217;s boot on their necks.   There is a direct line between installing the Shah and the rule of the Ayatollahs today.  </p>
<p>Given Kagan&#8217;s track record in getting things wrong in Iraq, the question is &#8211; would even his best case scenario, complete with ponies and unicorns, cause us major problems in the long run?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/200804071981.html">AllAfrica.com</a>, the largest electronic distributor of African news, has an interesting take on China&#8217;s impact on and relationship to Africa, asking: &#8220;Is China the Greedy Tiger Its Often Portrayed to be?&#8221;</p>
<p>The writer is not kind to the West, noting:<br />
<blockquote>Phrases such as the &#8220;new scramble for Africa&#8221;, &#8220;voracious&#8221;, &#8220;ravenous&#8221; or &#8220;insatiable&#8221; appetite for natural resources are typical descriptors used to characterise China&#8217;s engagement with Africa. In contrast, the operations of Western capitals for the same activities are described with anodyne phrases such as &#8220;development&#8221;, &#8220;investment&#8221;, &#8220;employment generation&#8221;<br />&#8230;<br />But China has the advantage of never having enslaved or colonized the continent. China has also not made any false promises coated with neo-liberalism. While the West, the IMF and the World Bank put conditions that only aid in their fleecing of Africa, China has so far been willing to provide unconditional aid and invest in infrastructure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Language is everything; style reflects moral posturing.</p>
<p>China wants the raw materials Africa has, so do we all: Diamonds, logs, cotton, and especially oil, importing 23% from Africa and 40% from the Middle East.<br />Africa, too, has suffered because of neoliberal policies:</p>
<blockquote><p>Much attention has been drawn to the negative impact of the cheap Chinese commodities on African economies. Certainly this has contributed to the decline of industrial production and the growing retrenchment of workers. But China has essentially taken advantage of the &#8220;opening-up&#8221; of Africa&#8217;s market that has resulted from the adoption of neoliberal economic policies that the international financial institutions, backed by the majority of the international aid agencies, have forced Africa&#8217;s governments to comply with.</p></blockquote>
<p>On this problem, the author gives China a partial pass:<br />
<blockquote>Given that the relative size of Chinese imports is small in comparison to imports from industrialised countries, the blame for the decline in industrial production and growing unemployment in Africa can hardly be place entirely at China&#8217;s door.<br />Furthermore, it is important to recognise that some 58 per cent of exports from China are manufactured by foreign owned companies.</p></blockquote>
<p>China, apparently, has learned from the West&#8217;s mistakes:<br />
<blockquote>China&#8217;s aid is attractive to African governments not only because of the favourable terms offered, but in particular because of the lack of conditionality that is offered that has so constrained, and many would argue, undermined development that would have the potential for bringing about social progress.<br />The most serious worry for the US was expressed by the spokespersons of the IMF and World Bank who complained that China&#8217;s unrestricted lending had &#8220;undermined&#8221; years of painstaking efforts to arrange conditional debt relief. There is clearly concern that China can now offer favourable loans to Africa and weaken imperial leverage over African economies.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;Undermined&#8217; years of painstaking efforts&#8221; are being undone. Unconditional aid&#8211;what a novelty!<br />Yet while China is helping,<br />
<blockquote>African countries to rebuild their infrastructure and providing other types of assistance to agriculture, water, health, education and other sectors</p></blockquote>
<p>there is the dark side about which we all must worry:<br />
<blockquote>Chinese companies are quickly generating the same kinds of environmental damage and community opposition that Western companies have spawned around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>China may be wiser and smarter in its approach to Africa, but it has yet to learn much about the environment.</p>

                                <p>With the death of Charlton Heston the other day, I got to thinking&#8230;  Back when I lived in the South in the late 1990s, I saw a bunch of vehicles with bumper sticker that read:  &#8220;My President is Charlton Heston.&#8221;  I wonder how many of the folks sporting such bumper stickers at the time have found themselves offended over the last seven years by the lack of support GW has been getting from the public at large.  My guess is, most of &#8217;em.</p>

<p>I was out of town on Friday and Saturday so I’m late to the discussion of the latest news from <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">BLS</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The unemployment rate rose from 4.8 to 5.1 percent in March, and nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend down (-80,000)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/bad-employment.html">Brad DeLong</a> looks at the payroll survey, which shows employment has declined by 232,000 in the last three months:  </p>
<blockquote><p>I will be very interested to see how labor productivity holds up during this recession-like period. Will this see labor hoarding or labor shedding? And, of course, the thing to stress is not that a recession has come but that the policies of the Bushies have done so much to make the previous expansion weaker and fighting this recessionary period harder than it had to be.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/05/labor-market-deterioration">Paul Krugman</a> argues that the weakness in the labor market started a while back and he wonders about the usefulness of the unemployment rate:</p>
<blockquote><p>I’ve argued on many occasions that the official unemployment rate has been a poor guide to the reality of the labor market in recent years. One alternative is “U6″, which the BLS lists under “alternative measures of labor underutilization.”  This measure shows what most people sense: the labor market has gotten a lot worse over the past year, not just in the last few months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our graph shows both the employment-population ratio (EP) and the labor force participation rate (LFP).  It is interesting that the fall in EP last month was only from 62.7% to 62.6% as part of the reason why the unemployment rate jumped was the increase in LFP from 65.9%.  But we must recall that EP has declined from 63.4% as of December 2006 to 62.6% last month. In the early part of 2007, the unemployment rate didn’t move much as LFP fell from 66.4% to 66%.  In other words – Paul is right in saying that the deterioration in the labor market has been going on for a while.  </p>
<p>In fact, it is so bad that even <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ODczOWVhYjkxYTJjYjUzNzk0MmYwZDcxNDUxZTdiODA=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> has to concede the obvious point:</p>
<blockquote><p>The unemployment rate went up to 5.1 percent. Non-farm payrolls have fallen for three straight months. Private payrolls have fallen four straight months. And the entrepreneurial small-business-oriented household survey is below its November peak, showing a loss of 678,000 jobs.  These are relatively mild job losses so far. So one can hope this will be a relatively mild recession. But frankly, no one knows for sure … Recessions are therapeutic. They cleanse excess from the economy. Think about excessive risk speculation, leverage, and housing. Recessions are curative: They restore balance and create the foundation for the next recovery.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes – Kudlow thinks recessions are good things as they job you just lost was an excess.  In fact, he is calling for economic policies that would make the recession worse:</p>
<blockquote><p>the U.S. dollar, which some are now calling the U.S. peso, should be appreciated in order to curb inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dollar appreciation might have a very modest impact on the inflation rate but it would have a significant impact on net export demand.  And given that Mr. Kudlow apparently never learned international macroeconomics, let’s remind him that appreciations tend to lower net exports.  One would think such idiotic comments would have the editors of the National Review take the curative step of getting rid of village idiots like Mr. Kudlow.  Then again – who would write their pieces on economics if not for their group of village idiots?<br />END</p>

                                <p>Here is <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,343671,00.html">John Lott at Fox News</a> telling us that all this talk about the economy being in recession is a media myth, and more, part of a pattern of the media trying to make Republicans look bad.</p>
<p>He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>During the 2000 election, with Bill Clinton as president, the economy was viewed through rose-colored glasses. According to polls, voters didn’t realize that the country was in a recession. Although the economy started shrinking in July 2000, most Americans through the entire year thought that the economy was fine.</p></blockquote>
<p>I hate to break it to Mr. Lott, but <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles.html">the economy was not in recession in 2000</a> or at any other point during the Clinton administration.  My guess is that this minor detail goes a long way toward explaining why &#8220;voters didn’t realize that the country was in a recession.&#8221; </p>
<p>Now, lest you think Lott was merely being hasty and didn&#8217;t mean to write that the economy was in recession in 2000:</p>
<blockquote><p>Talk of recession is seemingly everywhere. While the majority of people rate their personal finances positively, consumer confidence in the economy has plunged to a 16-year low, well below what it was during the last year of the Clinton administration when we were in a recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>But he&#8217;s also complaining that there&#8217;s talk of recession everywhere.  Granted, it will be a long time before the NBER makes an official determination of recession, but I think most people who aren&#8217;t associated with Fox can tell the difference between the year 2000 and now.  </p>
<p>Lott continues&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Or, even more telling, take the three months from July through September last year, when the GDP was growing at a phenomenal 4.9 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls">The annual percentage change in GDP</a> in 2007 was 4.9 percent.  Interestingly enough, the economy grew at over 4.9% a year in more than 75% of the years beginning in 1930.  The real growth rate in the economy (I&#8217;m too tired to go look for real GDP per capita right now) was 2.2%, and we had faster real growth than that in 70% of the years beginning in 1930.  What to John Lott is phenomenal, to the rest of us is pretty ho-hum.</p>
<p>And since Lott seems to think that we were in recession during Clinton&#8217;s last year, its worth pointing out that the percentage change in real GDP was faster than 2.2% every single year of the Clinton administration.  And since a 4.9% nominal growth rate is phenomenal, someone should point out to him that it was 5.9% in Clinton&#8217;s last year in office.</p>
<p>More Lott:</p>
<blockquote><p>A little perspective on the economy would be helpful. The average unemployment rate during President Clinton was 5.2 percent. The average under President George W. Bush is just slightly below 5.2. The current unemployment rate is 4.8 percent, almost half a percentage point lower than these averages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ah, averages.  But Lott doesn&#8217;t point out that the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/webapps/legacy/cpsatab1.htm">unemployment rate</a> was 8% in January of 1993, and it had shrunk to 4.7% in January of 2000, when he left office.  Conversely, it is now at 5.2%.  Put another way &#8211; it shrunk under Clinton, and rose under GW.  Lott might as well be bragging that the average real GDP is higher under GW than it was under Clinton.  </p>
<p>Then he tells us this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, research has indicated that media bias is real. Kevin Hassett and I looked at 12,620 newspaper and wire service headlines from 1985 through 2004 for stories on the release of official government releasing numbers on the unemployment rate, number of people employed, gross domestic product (GDP), retail sales, and durable goods.</p>
<p>Even after accounting for how well the economy was doing (e.g., what the unemployment rate was and whether it was going up or down), there was still a big difference in how positive or negative the headlines were. Democratic presidents got about 15 percent more positive headlines than Republicans for the same economic news.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, after Mr. Lott and Mr. Hassett adjusted for how well the economy was doing, Dems got better press than Reps.  Whether the press is biased or not is one thing, but I&#8217;m not ready to accept to accept the &#8220;accounting for how well the economy was doing&#8221; by a guy who tells us (twice in the same article) that the economy was in recession in 2000.  </p>
<p>The alternative is that maybe, just maybe, there&#8217;s a reason there are more stories about recessions while Republicans are in office:</p>

<p>This post is on <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08621t.pdf">GAO 08 621</a>, which discusses waste. </p>
<p>Waste is like its companions fraud and abuse, only in a lesser sense. It is somewhat between them. It is not criminal misrepresentation of material facts. Close!</p>
<p>What I think they are saying: &#8216;you cannot say a decision based on statistics, faulty hypothesis tests is a misrepresentation&#8217;, nor can one say that stating the gold plated, worst case and making it sound like the absolutely ciritical drop dead requiremnet without regard for opportunity costs debate is lying, either. See appendix II of the GAO for a good discussion.</p>
<p>A couple of old Army views.</p>
<p>&#8220;Paying your schilling&#8221;. This is the culture of &#8216;going along to get along&#8217;. Agreeing with the naked emperor and participating in fraud and waste, you know they are wrong but you succumb to the Melian dialog and put self interest ahead of truth and justice. You use the excuse when I get up there I will do right. Only you never get up there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Breaking Starch&#8221;: Being the emperor with no clothes. Keeping a starched uniform in the day room and when the CO is coming to your area jump into the uniform. Better paint all the rocks in the company area so that the place looks good and the CO thinks you are combat ready when all you can do is look good.</p>
<p>Both of these traditions and more are widespread not only in the DoD but other government organizations and it flourishes because there is money being made and no one wants to press for good management if it will change the culture and alter comfortable careers.</p>
<p>The culture of waste insists upon avoiding a clear and direct discussion of opportunity costs. Overcoming this culture with its allies in industry and PAC&#8217;s will be difficult. As GAO points out a return to the old icon of the independent, questioning civil servant protected by the Pendalton Act is needed. However, DoD is experimenting with an &#8220;improved&#8221; modern performance management which empowers managers to demand their schillings.</p>
<p>No one will ever ask if it would be better to &#8216;whiittle a beak&#8217; than spend the money on a vaguery which will cost too much and not work.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

The Fed thing is down toward the end of the third paragraph, right before the bit about being former Chairman of the Houston Grand Opera.  I&#8217;m not kidding.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/04/05/863058.aspx">Adam Aigner-Treworgy and Mark Murray</a> notes that John McCain demands an apology from Barack Obama for something Ed Shultz said:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a free country, and we have freedom of speech in America, and Mr. [Ed] Shultz is entitled to his views. I would hope that in keeping with his commitment that Sen. Obama would rapidly condemn, Sen. Obama would condemn such language since it was part of his campaign. But that kind of thing, I don&#8217;t think is necessary at all in this campaign. I made it very clear how I feel about war and my experiences with it.&#8221;  As mentioned earlier, the Obama campaign didn&#8217;t condemn Schultz&#8217;s remark, but issued this statement: &#8220;John McCain is not a warmonger and should not be described as such. He&#8217;s a supporter of a war that Senator Obama believes should have never been authorized and never been waged.&#8221; And contrary what McCain said, Shultz&#8217;s remark wasn&#8217;t technically part of Obama&#8217;s campaign; it came at a fundraiser for the North Dakota Democratic Party, which Obama attended.</p></blockquote>
<p>While the war monger comment by Shultz was certainly over the top – it is based on the fact that John McCain has become a neocon supreme.  But I can see someone arguing that such over the top comments should not become part of the Presidential campaign.  After all, I was really angry about the Swift Boat part of the 2004 campaign.  McCain pretended to be angry but when George W. Bush refused to reign in his dirty tricks squad, McCain still campaigned for Bush-Cheney.  To me – this was McCain being a hypocrite.  So far we have seen all sorts of dirty and dishonest attacks on Barack Obama from Republicans and to date John McCain has not even lifted a finger to stop this.  Until he does – Team Obama should ignore this call to renounce Ed Shultz.  If Team McCain wants a No Mud Sling Zone, they should being by practicing what they preach.  Then again – they would have to cease to be the Modern GOP if they got rid of their bag of dirty tricks.</p>

                                <p>Iraqi politics certainly is complicated. Try <a href="http://www.democracyarsenal.org/2008/04/round-and-round.html">this article</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>So, I was at a great Center for American Progress panel yesterday with journalists Nir Rosen and Michael Ware. They have been in Iraq for most of the last five years and get the perspective on the ground the we don&#8217;t usually hear about here. Ware said something that just totally blew my mind.</p>
<p>The Badr Organization is the military arm of the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI previously known as SCIRI). Now ISCI is closely aligned with Maliki government and is arguably the most significant player in the current central government. In fact significant elements of the Badr Organization have been incorporated into the Iraqi Security Forces.</p>
<p>Now, here is where things start to break down. The Badr Organization (Originally called the Badr Brigades) was originally formed by Iran. But according to Ware many of its members were considered to be part of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. And many of them are now considered to be retirees of the IRGC. Which means…wait for it&#8230; wait for it&#8230;</p>
<p>They still get pensions from the IRGC!! But it gets better. The Bush Administration has classified the IRGC as a terrorist organization!!</p>
<p>So, just so that we’re clear on this. We are building an army full of people who are still getting pension payments from an organization that the U.S. has designated a terrorist organization. And we are basing our entire future in Iraq on that army. Not only that, but when this army decides it’s going to take out its major opponent for power as it did last week, and <em>doesn’t even tell us about it</em>, we still back it up with air power and American troops as it stumbles&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>No special knowledge, but part of the general knowledge. The game begins.</p>
