                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/04/04/snow-bad-guys">ThinkProgress</a> listened the appearance of Tony Snow on Bill O’Reilly’s Radio Factor so we didn’t have to.  Snow decided to attack the patriotism of the Speaker of the House by making the following false claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>What happened was the bad guys backed down because they were getting crushed! … Moqtada al-Sadr is in hiding in Iran. That’s how tough it is.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK – we know Tony Snow lied a lot on Faux News before he joined the White House to tell more lies.  While Snow claimed Maliki crushed Sadr in SIX DAYS but ThinkProgress does a nice job of demonstrating how incredibly stupid the spin from Snow really was.  </p>
<p>Well – it seems <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/04/06/mccain-ceasefire-sadr">ThinkProgress</a> John McCain on Faux News this morning so we didn’t have to endure this either:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was al-Sadr that declared the ceasefire, not Maliki &#8230; With respect, I don’t think Sadr would have declared the ceasefire if he thought he was winning. Most times in history, military engagements, the winning side doesn’t declare the ceasefire. The second point is, overall, the Iraqi military performed pretty well. … The military is functioning very effectively.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was truly unbelievable!  Do we suggest that Senator McCain would be in the same class of liars as Tony Snow?  Maybe this was not mendacity – maybe McCain believes what he said.  But if he does, he truly is an idiot.  Is the type of candidate that the Republican Party wishes to nominate to be the next Commander-in-Chief?</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2008/04/rich-mccain-and-coming-heartbreak-ridge.html">Juan Cole</a> endorses a discussion Iraq by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/opinion/06rich.html?em&#038;ex=1207627200&#038;en=8515dfd7728d42cf&#038;ei=5087">Frank Rich</a>.  Rich details the incredible dishonesty from John McCain.  You should read it in full but Cole does provide this short review:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rich demolishes so many of the myths put out by McCain and the American Right generally. The Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and the Da&#8217;wa Party, which back Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, are closer to Iran than the Sadr Movement. It was al-Maliki&#8217;s parliamentary coalition that sought the cease fire by asking their Iranian patrons to broker a ceasefire. The main motivation for the attack on Sadrist neighborhoods in Basra was to ensure that ISCI wins the elections in that key oil province in October. It is so refreshing to see an American commentator who clearly has the facts at hand and a sense of proportion in interpreting them.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess Tony Snow will have to question the patriotism of Frank Rich.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/delong76">Brad DeLong</a> has an interesting analogy for recent developments for the global macroeconomy:</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps the best way to look at the situation is to recall that three locomotives have driven the world economy over the past 15 years. The first was heavy investment, centered in the United States, owing to the information technology revolution. The second was investment in buildings, once again centered in the US, driven by the housing boom. The third was manufacturing investment elsewhere in the world – predominantly in Asia – as the US became the world economy’s importer of last resort. For 15 years, these three locomotives kept the world economy near full employment and growing rapidly. When the high-tech boom ended in 2000, the Federal Reserve orchestrated its replacement by the housing boom, while investment in Asia to supply the US market was chugging along at an increasing pace. Many today are complaining about Alan Greenspan’s monetary stewardship, which kept these three locomotives stoked: “serial bubble-blower” is the most polite phrase that I have heard. But would the world economy really be better off today under an alternative monetary policy that kept unemployment in America at an average rate of 7% rather than 5%? Would it really be better off today if some $300 billion per year of US demand for the manufactures of Europe, Asia, and Latin America had simply gone missing?</p></blockquote>
<p>Not to interrupt Brad, but let’s note that he’s right about the recent – and in my view inappropriate &#8211; FED bashing.  But let’s give the microphone back to Brad:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first locomotive, however, ran out of fuel seven years ago, and there is no clear technology-driven alternative leading sector, like biotechnology, that can inspire similar exuberance, rational or otherwise. The second locomotive began sucking fumes two years ago, and is now coasting to a halt, which means that the third – the US as importer of last resort – is losing speed as well: the weak dollar accompanying the housing finance crash makes it unprofitable to export to the US. The world economy, as John Maynard Keynes put it 75 years ago, is developing magneto trouble. What it needs is a push – more aggregate demand. In the US, the weak dollar will be a powerful boost to net exports, and thus to aggregate demand. But, from the perspective of the world as a whole, net exports are a zero-sum game. So we will have to rely on other sources of aggregate demand.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Brad is correct that expenditure-switching policies being a zero-sum game for global demand (assuming similar marginal propensities to spend across nations) if some nations have more economic slack than others – expenditure-switching policies can complement the types of expenditure-adjusting policies that Brad advocates:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first source is the government. Fiscal prudence is as important as ever over the medium and long term. But for the next three years, governments should lower taxes – especially for the poor, who are most likely to spend – and spend more. The second source is private investment. The world’s central banks are already cutting interest rates on safe assets, and will cut them more as the proximity and magnitude of the likely global slump becomes clear. But low interest rates are entirely compatible with stagnation or depression if risk premia remain large – as the world learned in the 1930’s, and as Japan relearned in the 1990’s. The most challenging task for governments is to boost the private sector’s effective risk-bearing capacity so that businesses have access to capital on terms that tempt them to expand.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad is a fellow (long-run) deficit hawk so to suggest temporary fiscal stimulus must mean he is really concerned about a lack of aggregate demand.  Given the fact that I think his concern is well warranted, maybe it’s time for me to make my own small contribution.  As you may recall, I’ve been concerned about the tax cut route having <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/01/fiscal-stimulus-little-bang-for-buck.html">little bang for the buck</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Those who preach the Life Cycle Model (LCM) would tell us that that one-time rebates will be mostly saved with very little aggregate demand stimulus. In other words, a big impact on the current deficit but little impact on consumption demand just when we likely need it. There is a possible rebuttal to this LCM view that goes like this. Lower income households are likely liquidity constrained so a tax rebate is sort of like the loan they could not get from the bank. So if we target this temporary tax relief to lower income types, then maybe we will get a strong bang for the buck. But back to the politics where it has been standard operating procedure for the GOP to shift taxes onto the young by giving most of the tax breaks to rich older dudes. And these rich older dudes are not likely to be so liquidity constrained, which means the LCM view likely is valid if we let the GOP have its way. But isn’t this the real problem with the use of fiscal policy – partisan agendas tend to trump what most reasonable economists would consider the most effective means of handling our economic issues.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Brad did stress that tax cuts be given to the poor, let me also suggest we consider another locomotive – public investment in things like schools, bridges, and better roads. We could accelerate this type of spending and yet promise to return to fiscal prudence in a few years.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>On November 6, 2006, Vietnam entered the WTO. Western FDI could not wait: More cheap labor with a strong dictatorial regime to keep it line.</p>
<p>But things are not panning out as expected for the likes of firms such as Nike. Already, strikes are spreading across the country: <a href="http://communicatinglabourrights.wordpress.com/2008/04/05/vietnam-labour-vs-market/">20,000 workers</a> recently protested the $59 <i>monthly</i> salary. (No Nike sneakers for these workers, unless they plan not to eat for a few months.)</p>
<p>What is happening here? When workers in China were not paid anything, they rioted; but those riots were lost on the press. Certainly the economists gave it a pass: &#8220;Growing pains.&#8221; Vietnam is now attracting those same foreign firms that made a killing in China.</p>
<p>What makes Vietnam different from China?</p>
<p>Both are rigid, centrally controlled economies. Granted, China&#8217;s size makes it a bit harder to control. But when push comes to shove, don&#8217;t mess with Big Comrade.</p>
<p>I would suggest two things:
<ol>
<li>Size </li>
<li>History</li>
</ol>
<p>Others can suggest, I am sure, other reasons. But these two strike me as central.</p>
<p>Vietnam&#8217;s population is a drop in the bucket compared to China&#8217;s billion strong poor: 85 million compared to China&#8217;s 1.3 billion. Twenty thousand people protesting in Vietnam is news; in China, such protests would barely make the last page.</p>
<p>Then there is history, Vietnam&#8217;s history with the West: the French and the Americans. Communist Vietnam Central is anxious to get on the &#8220;developing country&#8221; bandwagon, build trade and account surpluses&#8211;at the expense of the worker, of course&#8211;all in the name of globalization and free markets. They want to follow China&#8217;s example, but &#8220;the Communist Party’s historical promotion of mass revolutionary movements against foreign exploitation is beginning to undermine badly its new capitalist gambit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, the people remember; they have not forgotten the French or us. Despite all our talk, they know we used them as pawns, just as the French did.</p>
<p>And how deep is this worker protest?</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year at least 541 labor strikes were held across the country, mostly at foreign-invested factories and involving an estimated 350,000 workers. </p>
<p>Those protests have clearly been fueled by a growing sense of economic injustice among factory workers and are now being compounded by galloping inflation rates. Consumer price inflation was 19.4% year on year in March, the biggest jump in over 13 years. Many economists are now starting to revised down their previously bullish economic growth forecasts for 2008.</p>

<p>Take a close look at the phrase &#8220;bullish economic growth forecasts.&#8221; How can we talk about &#8220;bullish economic growth&#8221; when people are making $59/month? What Vietnamese is profiting here? Some high party mucky-muck with connections to Nike and Hanoi?</p>
<p>Every time I mention something like this, someone <i>always</i> responds: &#8220;It is better than what they had,&#8221; as if we should be happy that they can make Nike sneakers at $0.30/hr, if that.</p>
<p>If you think that the Vietnam&#8217;s ruling party is really on the side of the workers, guess again.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>At the same time, in a clear concession to foreign investors, the government is also drafting a decree that will make workers responsible for employer costs in dealing with strikes and will give the state the authority to force workers back to factory lines if deemed in the national interest. If implemented, some labor analysts believe, these actions could soon put workers and the government on a collision course.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation: If Nike or any other foreign firm suffers a setback because of a strike, the workers have to tally up. Yes, even if you are working for $0.30/hour, if you strike, you will have to pay Nike or whomever.</p>
<p>Is there any sanity or humanity in the WTO? Does it have any idea of what it is doing? Why does the WTO allow entry to a country that has absolutely no concern for its own workers?</p>
<p>And what was the <a href="http://opencrs.cdt.org/document/RL33490/">Congressional role</a> in Vietnam&#8217;s WTO entry?</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Although Congress had no direct role in Vietnam&#8217;s accession to the WTO, congressional approval was necessary for the President to extend PNTR to Vietnam. The WTO requires its members to extend unconditional most-favored-nation status (MFN), called PNTR [Permanent Normal Trade Relations] in the United States, in order to receive the full benefits of WTO membership in their bilateral trade relations.</p></blockquote>
<p>On December 8, 2006, guiding by such organizations as the American Chamber of Commerce and such Democratic luminaries as Charlie Rangel and Hillary Clinton, Congress gave Vietnam PNTR.</p>
<p>On PNTR for Vietnam, Dennis Kucinich asked the <a href="http://www.gmpiu.org/pages/news/news_11_27_06c.aspx">some of the right questions:</a></p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Have we not had enough of the folly of the World Trade Organization?&#8221; which PNTR would let Vietnam join, asked Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio). &#8220;Have we not lost enough good-paying jobs in this country?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>To which I would add, what has WTO entry done for the Vietnamese people?</p>

<p>Create a post page for an ongoing project. So&#8230;on my <em>Continuing conversation page </em>page I include any notes I want my &#8216;team&#8217; to <br />see. When there are new information or questions or such, then let <br />me know by adding a comment to the ccp topic. Similarly, comments <br />are added when other tasks are completed. <br />By selecting the &#8220;notify me when changes are made&#8221; option in halsocan, you get <br />an email when someone leaves a comment.</p>
<p>Update:  Never post right after reading lines of code for awhile.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>What to do about the lobbying mess?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/05/us/politics/05penn.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">Today</a> we hear that Mark Penn, chief strategist and pollster for Hillary, is working both sides of the AFTA issue, a free trade agreement with Colombia, Peru, and Ecuador. While Hilliary ostensibly opposes the free trade agreement with Colombia, the Colombians hired Penn to work for AFTA. Guns are for hire&#8230;they will work both sides of an issue if the pay is right.</p>
<p>But one would think, or expect, a candidate to keep his or her own principles somewhat clear.</p>
<p>Is Hillary really against AFTA? Is Penn really for AFTA? Has Penn counselled her what to say on this score? Has he in turn told the Colombians not to worry: Hillary is in the bag. She just has to get elected first.</p>
<p>Colombia, in case you didn&#8217;t know, leads the world in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/18/business/worldbusiness/18union.html">assassinations</a> of labor leaders. Mark Penn clearly has no problem with this as he pursues his paycheck.</p>
<p>Does Hillary wonder about Mark Penn? If she is smart, she will profess innocence and fire Penn. But if she is that innocent and naive, should she be elected?</p>
<p>And then there is her hubby, Bill. Bill Clinton. In case you did not know it, Bill is quite an active lobbyist, having lobbyied for the DuBai ports deal. A while ago, Bill made the news when he secured a lucrative uranium mining deal for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/31/us/politics/31donor.html?hp">Frank Giustra</a>, after which Frank made a very handsome donation to Bill&#8217;s library.</p>
<p>Will Bill, now an active compaigner for Hillary, continue his sweet lobbying if Hillary becomes president? Would she like to comment on this one?</p>
<p>Where does all this end? Why do we put up with it? Hillary just happens to be the one caught flat-footed on this one. Yet the media and we its listeners follow the presidential race with rapt attention. Already, I am sure, each of you has his favorite in this race: Hillary, Obama, or McCain.</p>
<p>Me? I am voting for Nader. I will have lots to say about all this in the months ahead.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I have pulled two quotes from comments from a reader that state a view that might not occur to us. They are out of context, but I think might have some discussion value about perspectives. The first appears to stem from some of Greenspan&#8217;s ideas in a post on OCC regulation and state regulation.  The thought was the risk was not recognized by anyone important enough to sound a real warning.</p>
<blockquote><p>There are tons of regulation and oversight of the financial industry. There were no warnings, new regs, nothing, zero, zip from them regarding the mortgage crises except deer-in-the-headlights until it was too late. They were as oblivious as the bankers and the homebuyers were.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the OCC post, an interesting view about responsibility was also stated.<br />
<blockquote>The states&#8217; original beef with subprime was that it was unfair to the consumer or &#8220;predatory lending.&#8221; Since subprime mortgage providers are almost all bankrupt, it was really the subprime customer that fleeced the mortgage investors.</p></blockquote>
<p>Implications then are that policies of banks red lining were a spur to de-regulation? Or that predatory borrowers caused the crash?</p>
<p><em>Rdan here</em>. Many of us have little snippets of thought that are basic to points of view and are not &#8216;rational&#8217; in long thought out treatises, but gut level reaction sometimes too quick for examination. I myself have to be careful of &#8220;authority and abuse of power&#8221; situations, private or public.</p>
<p>But then the last comment was lost in the shuffle I believe. The key at least for this blog: <em>The basic perception that markets invariably create optimized results over time  was shaken</em>. It was a small statement, and simple, but I came back to it later and was struck how powerful it actually was for the reader.</p>
<p>Markets and trade involves mutual benefit and mutual aid as a fundamental driver of behavior in the big picture of why we trade. Why else would we trade? Personal and cohort gain is part of the story, but so is mutual benefit and aid. This notion is fundamental to society.</p>
<p>If one takes the notion that a market has no morality but somehow is truth, then that market self-destructs. Our notions of fairness probably are quite wide, but I suspect if we let ourselves be involved in the process of markets with a sense of some sort of fairness and mutual benefit, the pie would be more willingly shared. But the first step often is not an economic decision as we define economics today.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers may recall I&#8217;ve long criticized the BLS&#8217; unemployment figures as having become completely unreliable in recent years, and have pointed to the business birth-death model as the source of much of its virtual worthlessness many times.  Here is <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/">Tom Bozzo</a> who noted that according to the model:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;there were an additional 28,000 jobs in the construction sector, 7,000 in manufacturing, and 6,000 in financial activities jobs. I don&#8217;t think so.</p></blockquote>
<p>Its long past time to chuck the model.</p>

                                <p>Bruno Behrend wrote a <a href="http://www.extremewisdom.com/?p=1103">layman&#8217;s view of the Repo Market</a>.  As he noted, </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;the entire US (and international) financial system is so laden with funny money (essentially un-quantifyable assets), that even after billions have been written down, no one is willing to price them.</p>
<p>This “plain vanilla” repo market, that is “decades old” is so full of rotten apples (CDOs and synthetic CDOs), that the Fed couldn’t allow the market to price it. Too many institutions would have been exposed as holding essentially worthless assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>We had a brief e-mail exchange, in which I included the following vague:</p>
<blockquote><p>1.  The difference between the transparent products and the opaque ones is a bit more risk of failure, but if the failure does occur, it will be years later.<br />2.  Because they got a bit more of a margin on the opaque instruments (remember &#8211; any failures would happen years in the future), the banks stared issuing more of these opaque instruments.<br />3.  Over time, everyone got used to them.  And they couldn&#8217;t be so bad &#8211; after all, so far nobody lost money on them, right?  (That&#8217;s 2004, 2005, 2006). <br />4.  So the market grew and grew, and after a while, because the process went on and on and nobody lost money on those instruments, they became, as far as everyone was concerned, no more risky than plain vanilla.<br />5.  If you have the choice between two flavors of vanilla, you go with the one (opaque) that has the higher pay-ff.<br />6.  The future arrived.</p></blockquote>
<p>It occurs to me this is the timeline that exists with many financial meltdowns.  To a large extent, it explains how South American countries fell heavily in debt in the last century.  It explains how large (mostly American) banks got in trouble for lending money to South American countries.  To some extent, it explains the S&#038;L and junk bond fiasco, and the dotcom bubble.</p>

<p>Pulled from the front page of the <a href="http://www.georgewbushstore.com/home.htm">George W. Bush store</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>As licensee for the last eight years to the George W. Bush Presidential Campaigns, and as the creator of the George W. Bush Store, Spalding Group has been fortunate to experience the tremendous popularity and respect that President Bush has attained. As President Bush enters his last year in office, we are receiving countless requests for new items that allow supporters to demonstrate their appreciation and admiration for our President.</p>
<p>As a result, Spalding Group is proud to present the first in a series of products that reflect our way of saying &#8220;Thank You&#8221; to President Bush. Check back often as we add new items throughout the year.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think its a partisan to say that GW hasn&#8217;t exactly experienced &#8220;tremendous popularity and respect&#8221; and that most Americans (and foreigners for that matter) don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s in the same league recent predecessors like Clinton, GHW Bush, and Reagan.  I realize this company is targeting a very specific market: the dwindling percentage of Americans who feel any need to &#8220;to demonstrate their appreciation and admiration for our President.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Which leads to a question&#8230; why do people feel the need to believe that huge numbers of other people feel as they do?  Its one thing to believe you&#8217;re right, its a whole another thing to convince yourself, despite all sorts of evidence to the contrary, that all but a small fringe of terrorist-loving moonbats (it is necessary to have someone on the other side, after all) agrees with you.  In this case, for the dwindling 28% or so to believe that GW should be very popular requires ignoring a lot more evidence than believing he is popular.  (As Coberly mentioned in comments to another post, I hasten to add:  a Democrat President who had spent the last seven years getting us from the year 2000 to here would probably also have a core group of die-hards, so this is not a Republican v. Democrat issue.)  </p>
<p>But&#8230;  did those who supported Reagan or Clinton, to name two Presidents who actually were popular, and both of whom were respected by at least half the population, also feel the need to make themselves believe that President was more popular and respected than he actually was?  Does the desire to convince oneself and others that one is part of a large herd increase when the herd is really very, very small?  And is there a point where evidence overwhelms one&#8217;s wish or ability to believe things contrary to that evidence for everyone?</p>
