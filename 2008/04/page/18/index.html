<p>In <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/business/357333_air02.html">this article</a> by James Wallace in the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, we learn that some generals have joined the PR battle on behalf of Northrop, writing to Defense Secretary Gates urging him to stand by the Air Force mistake on the KC-135 replacement.</p>
<p>The generals present only arguments against the protest process none that make any sense about the reasons for the protest.</p>
<p>You will hear about KC 135 corrosion problems &#8211; I will assert that the fix of the corrosion is cheap easy and done in a routine depot repair cycle, with the cost of a million or so dollars, decent material management and a few days extra time in the depot.</p>
<p>This argument between military industrialists reminds me of the following I saw over the weekend.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey I can sell newer crap that doesn&#8217;t work than he can.&#8221; Jeff Huber comment at My Left Wing 30 Mar 08.</p>
<p>How about lining up all the brass to argue for their team against the other team?</p>
<p>Everything is PR!</p>
<p>Do not discuss how a 24% heavier aircraft like the Airbus could be the same acquisition and ownership costs while its added weight is needed only in the new mission of establishing &#8220;air bridges&#8221; around the world to project US power to the farthest and least hospitable corners of the world.</p>
<p>The reason the US is not airlifting support to Tibet is not that the KC 135 can&#8217;t refuel C-17&#8217;s, it is that it makes no sense. Won&#8217;t make any more sense with the Airbus.</p>
<p>Might as well whittle a beak&#8230;</p>

<p>Hat tip to Jim Satterfield for this link to <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/04/01/credit_default_swaps_q/">Marketplace</a> public radio.  Bob Moon is the Senior Business Correspondent.</p>
<blockquote><p>MOON: OK, I&#8217;m about to unload some numbers on you here, so I&#8217;ll speak slowly so you can follow this.</p>
<p><strong>The value of the entire U.S. Treasuries market: $4.5 trillion.</p>
<p>The value of the entire mortgage market: $7 trillion.</p>
<p>The size of the U.S. stock market: $22 trillion.</p>
<p>OK, you ready?</p>
<p>The size of the credit default swap market last year: $45 trillion</strong>.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>RYSSDAL: OK, I&#8217;m with you, but let me ask you this. We just had the secretary of the Treasury yesterday with a big policy announcement. If these things are so bad, what&#8217;s being done about it?</p>
<p>MOON: The irony here is that the former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, a couple of years ago he called credit default swaps &#8220;probably the most important instrument in finance,&#8221; because they were supposed to spread risk around and stabilize the market. Well, critics now say that they&#8217;ve had exactly the opposite effect. One of the leading critics of these things is Christopher Whalen. He&#8217;s an expert on financial risk at Institutional Risk Analytics. And he told me that this is nothing more than government-guaranteed gambling:</p>
<p>CHRISTOPHER WHALEN: They are the most hideous kind of speculation. To have a federally insured bank like JPMorgan as the largest dealer in this market, to me says we don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re doing anymore, and we don&#8217;t understand the difference between real work &#8212; real economic activity &#8212; and something that&#8217;s essentially wasting.</p>
<p>MOON: And Whalen points out that Bear Stearns had more than $2.5 trillion in credit default swaps. He suspects that that&#8217;s why JPMorgan came to the rescue, so it didn&#8217;t get pulled down.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>From <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/sallie-mae-couldnt-have-predictedmodel.html">Rdan&#8217;s Sallie Mae</a> post I got the urge to hunt because vtcodger mentioned greed.</p>
<p>Greed?  Yes, I have recently learned that one person who works to manage the endowment fund for Harvard got a bonus for last year performance that was less than the year before of $2M.  Imagine that!  The endowment is so large and produced so much, that $2m could be handed out like a tip.  (Of course, this is second hand knowledge.)</p>
<p>So let us see how Harvard is doing. <br />The fund is currently valued <a href="http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/08.23/99-endowment.html">at $34.9 Billion</a>.<br />
<blockquote>Harvard University’s endowment earned a 23.0 percent return during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007. <br />From fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2007, for example, scholarships and awards to students from University funds increased by over 94 percent, to $302 million from $156 million. Endowment dollars distributed for overall Harvard programs rose more than 70percent during the same period, from $615 million to $1.04 billion. </p></blockquote>
<p>$1.04 billion or 3%.  Only 3%. Yet:<br /><em>Since its inception, HMC has averaged an annualized rate of return of 13.3 percent.</em></p>
<p>The industry average is: <em>the median for the 151 large institutional funds as measured by the Trust Universe Comparison Service (17.7 percent), as well as the 20.9 percent that marks the top 5 percentile.</em></p>
<p>Granted, I&#8217;m sure and as they say there are restrictions.  However, Harvard says they are trying to spend 5% annually.   They note tuition only covers 2/3 of the cost.   Well if they really tried to get to that 5%, they would have another $705 million for it.  At <a href="http://www.fao.fas.harvard.edu/cost.htm">their tuition </a>of $47,215, that&#8217;s 14,932 students.  The <a href="http://www.stateuniversity.com/universities/MA/Harvard_University.html">total enrollemnt</a> is only 25,017 including part-timers. </p>

                                <p>&#8220;Transformational Outsourcing&#8221; is the new buzzword, a small twist on the old &#8220;lift and shift&#8221; strategy. Lift the plant out of Ohio and plunk it down in China. Packaged in the buzzword are the usual promises of U.S. job creation and the stark reality of our Brave New World.</p>
<p>For a consulting company advising companies about to offshoring, it means thinking beyond labor arbitrage, offshoring not just to cut labor costs. Instead, a CEO should think of how offshoring will transform the company, offering him opportunities to restructure profitably.</p>
<p>In a report entitled <a href="http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/cda/doc/content/ca_en_oas_pov_feb08%282%29.pdf">Why Settle for Less</a>, Deloitte, a consulting firm, said transformational outsourcing :</p>
<blockquote><p>can be used as a tool to improve the company’s competitiveness and performance across finance, marketing, customer satisfaction, R&#038;D, and other critical areas.<br />One global media company used outsourcing with a major vendor as a way to reengineer its finance and accounting processes to create a single shared financial system, consolidating 11 stand-alone systems. As a result, it was able to slash internal trading volumes by 75% and reduce financial management costs by 50%.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Deloitte pitch is worth the read, containing an interesting survey of some 300 executives of large and mid-size firms.</p>
<p><i>Business Week</i> has an interesting <a href="http://www2.blogger.com/href=">article</a> on &#8220;transformational outsourcing&#8221; in which it claims it is not only a job killer but a job creator. The lead and only example of this new paradigm&#8211;destroyer but creator of jobs&#8211;is in the first few paragraphs.</p>
<p>Our hero is a packaging plant in Wisconsin.</p>
<p>Two years ago, one of its biggest customers told it &#8220;to slash its machinery prices by 40% and urged it to move production to China.&#8221; Last year, a holding company, Barry-Wehmiller Cos, bought the plant, cut the workers and nonunion pay.</p>
<p>By this time, the 900 of the 2000 jobs had been lost; sales had shrunk 40%. Clearly, the packaging plant should have moved production to China.</p>
<p>But the writer of the article has good news, even though some offshoring is necessary:</p>
<blockquote><p>Barry-Wehmiller plans to shift some design work to its 160-engineer center in Chennai, India. By having U.S. and Indian designers collaborate 24/7, explains Vasant Bennett, president of Barry-Wehmiller&#8217;s engineering services unit, PCMC hopes to slash development costs and time, win orders it often missed due to engineering constraints &#8212; and keep production in Green Bay. Barry-Wehmiller says the strategy already has boosted profits at some of the 32 other midsize U.S. machinery makers it has bought. &#8220;We can compete and create great American jobs,&#8221; vows CEO Robert Chapman. &#8220;But not without offshoring.&#8221;Come again? Ever since the offshore shift of skilled work sparked widespread debate and a political firestorm three years ago, it has been portrayed as the killer of good-paying American jobs. </p></blockquote>
<p>Has the writer been paying attention to his own example? Has he asked the right questions?</p>
<p>Had the Wisconsin company&#8217;s competitors already moved to China before the holding company bought it? or to some other developing country where labor is cheap?</p>
<p>And what about the final solution? Offshoring some of the design work to India? What good paying jobs were created in this process?  Wages were cut; then some jobs were offshored. </p>
<p>Barry-Wehmiller says that it has boosted profits in some of the 32 other midsize machinery makers it bought.</p>
<p>What precisely happened at the those other plants? Did it first cut &#8220;workers and nonunion pay?&#8221; as it did with the Wisconsin company? Holding companies can be merciless.</p>
<p>But the writer has told us that this process is a job creator. The lie has been inserted. It will continue through the article as we are told the brutal reality of what is occuring.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Workers&#8217; fears have some grounding in fact. The prime motive of most corporate bean counters jumping on the offshoring bandwagon has been to take advantage of such &#8220;labor arbitrage&#8221; &#8212; the huge wage gap between industrialized and developing nations. And without doubt, big layoffs often accompany big outsourcing deals.The changes can be harsh and deep. But a more enlightened, strategic view of global sourcing is starting to emerge as managers get a better fix on its potential. The new buzzword is &#8220;transformational outsourcing.&#8221; Many executives are discovering offshoring is really about corporate growth, making better use of skilled U.S. staff, and even job creation in the U.S., not just cheap wages abroad. </p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the article is a tour de force of how offshoring is changing the face of every industry:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new attitude is emerging in corporations across the U.S. and Europe in virtually every industry. Ask executives at Penske Truck Leasing why the company outsources dozens of business processes to Mexico and India, and they cite greater efficiency and customer service. Ask managers at U.S.-Dutch professional publishing giant Wolters Kluwer why they&#8217;re racing to shift software development and editorial work to India and the Philippines, and they will say it&#8217;s about being able to pump out a greater variety of books, journals, and Web-based content more rapidly. Ask Wachovia Corp., the Charlotte (N.C.)-based bank, why it just inked a $1.1 billion deal with India&#8217;s Genpact to outsource finance and accounting jobs and why it handed over administration of its human-resources programs to Lincolnshire (Ill.)-based Hewitt Associates. </p>
<p>But as companies work out such kinks, the rise of the offshore option is dramatically changing the economics of reengineering. With millions of low-cost engineers, financial analysts, consumer marketers, and architects now readily available via the Web, CEOs can see a quicker payoff. &#8220;It used to be that companies struggled for a few years to show a 5% or 10% increase in productivity from outsourcing,&#8221; says Pramod Bhasin, CEO of Genpact, the 19,000-employee back-office-processing unit spun off by GE last year. &#8220;But by offshoring work, they can see savings of 30% to 40% in the first year&#8221; in labor costs. Then the efficiency gains kick in. A $10 billion company might initially only shave a few million dollars in wages after transferring back-office procurement or bill collection overseas. But better management of these processes could free up hundreds of millions in cash flow annually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Check the job list; you might be on it. Editorial work to India? Hey, I need an editor.</p>
<p>The last paragraph states the final promise&#8230;and problem for those who use labor arbitrage:<br />
<blockquote>The management challenges will grow more urgent as rising global salaries dissipate the easy cost gains from offshore outsourcing. The winning companies of the future will be those most adept at leveraging global talent to transform themselves and their industries, creating better jobs for everyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Better jobs for everyone&#8221; means &#8220;better jobs&#8221; for India and China. The writer has switched gears on us. Better jobs are not coming to the U.S. They are going to India and China.</p>
<p>The only problem for companies will be when wages become more uniform, after the &#8220;glorious rush to the bottom,&#8221; when labor arbitrage is not such a delicious meal. How long do we have to wait for wages to even out? What happens in the interim?</p>
<p>The trouble with all this is that consumers are workers. Right now, globalization seems dependent on the American consumer. That may be ending. If we offshore to workers who are not paid consumer salaries and the American consumer is tapped out, who then can afford the products? Will there be enough consumers, discounting, of course, those who consume multi-mega-mansions and 500&#8242; yachts.</p>
<p>Paul Krugman once <a href="http://blog.aflcio.org/2008/01/07/paul-krugman-strong-unions-create-a-strong-middle-class/">said</a>: &#8220;To have a middle class society, you need a strong labor movement.&#8221; Globalization is eviscerating our middle class&#8230;and the middle class is the great consumer.</p>
<p>I do not see a strong labor movement in China. In fact, is there a labor movement there?</p>
<p>And what about the labor movement here? Is it still here? Have we done anything in our trade deals or in the WTO to protect it?</p>
<p>Are we ready to insist that all our trading partners have strong labor movements?</p>
<p>

<blockquote><p>Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson traveled to China this week to discuss, among other things, the impact of the credit crisis on the Chinese economy. He attempted to reassure Chinese officials that U.S. officials are working through the financial turmoil, although he cautioned that there might be more obstacles in the near future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some Chinese banks have swallowed a bit of those toxic pills. China&#8217;s good will&#8211;via its purchase of dollars&#8211; is financing our deficit. Keep your big creditors happy. Besides, we need the imports.</p>
<p>Our companies have invested a great deal in China. Wish them well. And hope for continued support from central banks and soverign wealth funds.</p>

<blockquote><p>Last week, <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/blog/blog/higher-ed-watch/2008/class-action-lawsuit-challenges-sallie-mae-s-subprime-lending-practices-2589" target="_blank">we wrote that Sallie Mae and its promoters on Wall Street claim the company was &#8220;blind-sided&#8221; </a>by the rising default and delinquency rates on <a href="http://www.newamerica.net/blog/higher-ed-watch/2008/subprime-mess-reaches-higher-ed-1823" target="_blank">subprime private loans it made to low-income and working class students</a> at poor performing higher education trade schools. It&#8217;s a convenient argument considering that the loan giant is facing at least one, and possibly several, class action lawsuits by angry shareholders who accuse the company of deliberately misleading them about the amount of risk it was assuming. But the argument is disingenuous at best.<br />Financial analysts have long raised red flags about Sallie Mae&#8217;s private lending practices. During earnings calls and at shareholder meetings and investment conferences, analysts regularly peppered Sallie Mae officials with questions about whether the company, which is used to having government backing on its loans, had the expertise needed to assess the risks associated with lending unsecured, private loan debt to financially-needy students.<br />&#8230;.<br />In 2005, Fortune Magazine brought attention to the analysts&#8217; worries in an article entitled, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2005/12/26/8364649/index.htm" target="_blank">&#8220;When Sallie Met Wall Street.&#8221; </a>That piece specifically raised concerns about the loan company&#8217;s dealings with schools owned by Career Education Corporation, which it noted had had been accused &#8220;in multiple lawsuits in several states of using hard-sell tactics to recruit students, promising them high-paying jobs that don&#8217;t materialize and leaving them with mountains of debt that they can&#8217;t pay off.&#8221;<br />The article&#8217;s author &#8212; Bethany McLean (who, by the way,<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A64769-2002Jan17.html" target="_blank"> helped break the Enron scandal</a>) &#8212; proved prescient in predicting the predicament in which Sallie Mae now finds itself. McLean wrote:<br />[A] big question looms in Sallie Mae&#8217;s private credit business: How many students who take out these high-interest loans will end up defaulting? After all, private credits are basically unsecured loans to people without jobs. Sallie argues that there won&#8217;t be a problem. Each quarter it books a reserve for potential losses; at this time its loss on private credit loans in repayment are running at only 2.4%. Plus, Sallie says, almost half its private credit loans are guaranteed by a parent.<br />But because private credit is a new business and because students are taking on unprecedented levels of debt, there are no historical measurements by which to gauge potential defaults. As Sallie&#8217;s financials note, &#8220;the provision for loan losses is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant changes.&#8221; And the current low delinquency rate may be misleading, because as of the end of 2004 nearly half the students to whom Sallie has lent private money hadn&#8217;t left school yet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Lots of financials are changing.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/03/why-did-risk-mo.html">Here is Avinash Persaud</a>, writing on Willem Buiter&#8217;s blog, with his take on the problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why Bank Risk Models Failed and the Implications for what Policy Makers Have to Do Now, by Avinash D. Persaud: Sir Alan Greenspan, and others have questioned why risk models, which are at the centre of financial supervision, failed to avoid or mitigate today’s financial turmoil. There are two answers to this, one technical and the other philosophical. Neither is complex, but many regulators and central bankers chose to ignore them both.</p>
<p>The technical explanation is that market-sensitive risk models used by thousands of market participants work on the assumption that each user is the only person using them. This was not a bad approximation in 1952, when the intellectual underpinnings of these models were being developed &#8230; by Harry Markovitz and George Dantzig. &#8230;</p>
<p>In today’s flat world, market participants from Argentina to New Zealand have the same data on the risk, returns and correlation of financial instruments and use standard optimization models, which throw up the same portfolios to be favoured and those not to be. Market participants don’t stare helplessly at these results. They move into the favoured markets and out of the unfavoured. Enormous cross-border capital flows are unleashed. But under the weight of the herd, favoured instruments cannot remain undervalued, uncorrelated and low risk. &#8230;</p>
<p>When a market participant’s risk model detects a rise in risk in his portfolio, perhaps because of some random rise in volatility, and he tries to reduce his exposure, many others are trying to do the same thing at the same time with the same assets. A vicious cycle ensues of vertical price falls prompting further selling. Liquidity vanishes down a black hole. &#8230;</p>
<p>Policy makers cannot claim to be surprised by all of this. The observation that market-sensitive risk models &#8230; were going to send the herd off the cliff edge was made soon after the last round of crises*. Many policy officials in charge today, responded then that these warnings were too extreme to be considered realistic.</p>
<p>This brings us to the philosophical problem of the reliance of supervisors on bank risk models. The reason we regulate markets over and above normal corporate law is that from time to time markets fail and these failings have devastating consequences. If the purpose of regulation is to avoid market failures, we cannot use &#8230; risk-models that rely on market prices, or any other instrument derived from market prices such as mark-to-market accounting. Market prices cannot save us from market failures. Yet, this is the thrust of modern financial regulation, which calls for more transparency on prices, more price-sensitive risk models and more price-sensitive prudential controls. These tools are like seat belts that stop working whenever you press hard on the accelerator.</p>
<p>In terms of solutions, there is only space to observe that if we rely on market prices in our risk models and in value accounting, we must do so on the understanding that in rowdy times central banks will have to become buyers of last resort of distressed assets to avoid systemic collapse. This is the approach we have stumbled upon. Central bankers now consider mortgage-backed securities as collateral for their loans to banks. But the asymmetry of being a buyer of last resort without also being a seller of last resort during the unsustainable boom will only condemn us to cycles of instability.</p>
<p>The alternative is to try and avoid booms and crashes through regulatory and fiscal mechanisms designed to work against the incentives &#8230; for traders and investors to double up or more into something that the markets currently believe is a sure bet. This sounds fraught and policy makers are not as ambitious as they once were. &#8230;</p>
<p>Regulatory ambition should be set now, while the fear of the current crisis is fresh and not when the crisis is over and the seat belts are working again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another good angle on models and validation. Incentives count too.</p>

Once, while my sister was undergoing heart surgery and I was waiting to hear how it went, to distract myself, I wrote a post that was absolutely and completely logically wrong.  Clearly my mind was elsewhere.  Still, I posted it without thinking&#8230; In the middle of the night, I realized what I had done&#8230; and by then so had a number of readers judging from the comments section.  The post is still online, but I&#8217;ve added warnings at the top and bottom of the post noting that the entire post is an error in logic.</p>
<p>Question&#8230;  what should one do, if one is referencing something someone else wrote, and one realizes it makes less sense than one thought?  Presumably, its kosher to delete a post three minutes after it was put up?  What about two hours later?  Or a day later?  What is the statute of limitations?</p>

<p>I&#8217;d like to comment on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/31/AR2008033102789.html?hpid=topnews">this front page story</a> in the Washington Post, published on April 1, 2008 by Dana Hedgpeth, a Washington Post Staff Writer.</p>
<blockquote><p>GAO Blasts Weapons Budget<br />Cost Overruns Hit $295 Billion</p>
<p>Government auditors issued a scathing review yesterday of dozens of the Pentagon&#8217;s biggest weapons systems, saying ships, aircraft and satellites are billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule.</p>
<p>Auditors said the Defense Department showed few signs of improvement since the GAO began issuing its annual assessments of selected weapons systems six years ago. &#8220;It&#8217;s not getting any better by any means,&#8221; said Michael Sullivan, director of GAO&#8217;s acquisition and sourcing team. &#8220;It&#8217;s taking longer and costing more.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In most cases, programs also failed to deliver capabilities when promised &#8212; often forcing war fighters to spend additional funds on maintaining&#8221; existing weapons systems, the report says.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is somewhat misleading. In almost every case the reliability of new systems is poor, requires more people to repair it, resulting in lost utility, more maintenance equipment, parts and costing more than keeping the old system running. This will be the case with the Airbus tanker. The KC-135 even with more depot stays will be more useful and cheaper to operate than the Airbus.</p>
<blockquote><p>The GAO chose 72 systems to examine, based on high-dollar value and congressional interest. The various systems were at different stages of the acquisition process over the last year.</p>
<p>The GAO&#8217;s Sullivan said the reasons for the cost overruns and delays are threefold: There are too many programs chasing too few dollars; technologies are often not mature enough to go into production; and it takes too long to design, develop and produce a system.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re asking for something that they&#8217;re not sure can be built, given existing technologies, and that&#8217;s risky,&#8221; Sullivan said in an interview.</p></blockquote>
<p>That engineering is faulty is cultural.  When a program goes into Full Development (the government manager knows what can be developed, built and sustained at given set of costs) the underlying technology is supposed to be proven.  NASA has a series of technology readiness levels which DoD has adopted.  The rush is to get into production to help the industry make money.  Money is the reason we see all these &#8220;do-overs&#8221;.  The profit is the same the third time around.</p>
<blockquote><p>Steven L. Schooner, co-director of the government procurement law program at George Washington University, said the GAO&#8217;s report reveals the recurring problems the Pentagon faces with its costly procurements.</p>
<p>&#8220;The nature of major weapon systems development is that you have to expect that the initial estimates, and typically the initial contracts, are overly optimistic and unrealistic,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Unfortunately the purchaser &#8212; the government &#8212; typically lacks the discipline to freeze the configuration such that the contractor has any reasonable chance of developing what it promised on time and for the price promised.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This is a straw man, most of the specification changes are relieving the designer of requirements for things like quality manufacturing, technical data, eliminating testing and on occasion a new requirement is added to give the appearance that the added funding is not a bail out. An example, when the government requires a certain outcome which will cause the developer to lose money the developer asks the government to change the contract to pay again for the work already required. This seems to be a requirement change but it is not rooted in any technical aspect but in paying twice for the work to be done in a different manner a hidden &#8216;do over&#8217; to compensate for an overrun.</p>
<blockquote><p>Defense Department officials have tried to improve the procurement process, the GAO said, by doing more planning and review in the early stages of a contract. But &#8220;these significant policy changes have not yet translated into best practices on individual programs,&#8221; Gene L. Dodaro, acting comptroller general of the GAO, wrote in the report.</p>
<p>&#8220;Flagship acquisitions, as well as many other top priorities in each of the services, continue to cost significantly more, take longer to produce, and deliver less than was promised,&#8221; Dodaro said. &#8220;This is likely to continue until the overall environment for weapon system acquisitions changes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The DoD must, but won&#8217;t, require the contractors perform as promised in the development contracts or put them out of business not give a company overrunning and not delivering a 99% rating on &#8220;past performance&#8221; in the next competition. Also, DoD managers must consider the value to the taxpayer, not their career or some recondite agenda to &#8216;take care&#8217; of the soldier. </p>

<p>Here is some information on <a href="http://www.investopedia.com/university/behavioral_finance/">Behavioral Finance.</a></p>
<blockquote><p>According to conventional financial theory, the world and its participants are, for the most part, rational &#8220;wealth maximizers&#8221;. However, there are many instances where emotion and psychology influence our decisions, causing us to behave in unpredictable or irrational ways.</p>
<p>Behavioral finance is a relatively new field that seeks to combine behavioral and cognitive psychological theory with conventional economics and finance to provide explanations for why people make irrational financial decisions</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.irvinehousingblog.com/2008/03/29/efficient-markets-vs-behavioral-finance/">The Irvine Housing blogger</a> nails it.</p>
<p>Efficient Markets vs. Behavioral Finance</p>
<blockquote><p>The efficient markets theory is the idea that speculative asset prices always incorporate the best information about fundamental values and that prices change only because new information enters the market and investors act in an appropriate, rational manner with regards to this information. This idea dominated academic fields in the early 1970s. Efficient markets theory is an elegant attempt to tether asset prices to fundamentals through the common-sense notion that people would not behave in irrational ways with their money in financial markets.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Efficient markets theory explains the majority of market behavior, but it has one major flaw which renders it inoperable as a forecasting tool: it does not explain those instances when prices become very volatile and detach from their fundamental valuations&#8230;..when price change begins to feedback on itself, behavioral finance is the only theory that explains this phenomenon.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Behavioral Finance abandoned the quest of the efficient markets theory to find a rational, mathematical model to explain fluctuations in asset prices. Instead, behavioral finance looked to psychology to explain asset valuation and why prices rise and fall. The primary representation of market behavior postulated by behavioral finance is the price-to-price feedback model: prices go up because prices have been going up, and prices go down because prices have been going down. If investors are making money because asset prices increase, other investors take note of the profits being made, and they want to capture those profits as well. They buy the asset, and prices continue to rise. The higher prices rise and the longer it goes on, the more attention is brought to the positive price changes and the more investors want to get involved. These investors are not buying because they think the asset is fairly valued, they are buying because the value is going up. They assume other rational investors must be bidding prices higher, and in their minds they “borrow” the collective expertise of the market. In reality, they are just following the herd.</p></blockquote>
