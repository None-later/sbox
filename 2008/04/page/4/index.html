                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/24/opinion/24kristof.html?_r=1&#038;ex=1366776000&#038;en=d3bb7292e48e6916&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss&#038;pagewanted=all&#038;oref=slogin">Nicholas Kristof</a> slams those go-it-alone-cowboys who oppose the proposed trade pact with Colombia but then he notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Some Democrats claim that they are against the pact because Colombia has abused human rights. Those concerns are legitimate — but they shouldn’t be used to punish people like Norma Reynosa, a 35-year-old woman who just may snip the flowers that go into the Mother’s Day bouquet that you buy … One reason is those bouquets you buy, entering duty-free from Colombia. These days Colombia is the world’s second-largest exporter of flowers after the Netherlands, and almost 200,000 people work in the flower industry. Up to 28 cargo planes a day carry flowers from Colombia to the U.S.  Better carnations than cocaine, no?  Critics of the free-trade pact worry that it would hurt American workers. But Colombian goods already enter the U.S. duty-free; what would change is that American exporters would get access to the Colombian market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did you get that?  We currently don’t impose tariffs on imports from Colombia.  So how is maintaining the status quo punishing Norma Reynosa?  And I just don’t get this close:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of President Bush’s most costly actions was his flat rejection of the Kyoto climate treaty; it symbolized a my-way-or-the-highway approach that bolstered anti-Americanism around the world. If the Colombia free-trade pact is rejected and the U.S. backs away from its commitment to expanding trade, that may be the Democrats’ equivalent of Kyoto, signaling a retreat from internationalism. It would be seen as the United States thumbing its nose at the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Are we thumbing our noses by having no tariffs – or just by not promising never to have tariffs in the future?  But to be fair, going from a policy of no tariffs on Colombian imports to no tariffs on Colombian imports isn’t going exactly to cost lots of American jobs, while getting Colombia to lower its tariffs may boost our exports just a wee bit.</p>

<blockquote><p>What matters is going on the offense against the author of the typically bizarre, distracting, and hideous rightwing attacks: John McCain.  It ought to be beneath senator McCain to have his side label Obama as a terrible person because he has failed to shun a fellow who did wrong 40 years or is not a patriot because he neglected to wear a flag on lapel, or declined to disavow a Korean War vet and pastor because he spoke too harshly one Sunday. McCain went to Vietnam to re-open peaceful relations, so he knows the place of forgiveness. He is a man of military honor and knows how to respect a friend and a foe. Hence, it ought to be beneath McCain to tolerate attacks against Obama that closely resemble the despicable charges bush launched against McCain in South Carolina in 2000. It should be the case that mccain doesn&#8217;t just pretend to stop these attacks, but actually does so. Aside from his laissez-faire positions on iraq and the economy, McCain&#8217;s primary disqualification for the oval office is that he knows these vile, crazy attacks are wrong for America but he won&#8217;t stop them.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/04/mccain_says_hell_bring_every_p.php">Greg Sargent</a> starts by noting that McCain publicly said this ad should not be run:</p>
<blockquote><p>John McCain promised at a town-hall meeting today that he would bring &#8220;every pressure to bear&#8221; to stop the North Carolina GOP from running that ad hitting Obama over his controversial pastor, an issue that McCain said wasn&#8217;t a legit one.  The North Carolina GOP&#8217;s spot has McCain in something of a jam. He has come out and condemned the ad and said he doesn&#8217;t want it to air, but he&#8217;s now taking hits from Democrats who are demanding that he do more as the GOP&#8217;s standard bearer to stop it from running. And if he can&#8217;t get that done he risks looking weak. Indeed, a top McCain strategist is now telling Time magazine that the ad won&#8217;t be running at all &#8212; the implication being that McCain managed to put the kibosh on it behind the scenes. But guess what &#8212; a spokesperson for the North Carolina GOP just told me that this isn&#8217;t the case.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s go back to the actual Swiftboating of John Kerry.  Anyone who doesn’t realize that Bush-Cheney was behind the Swift Boat liars is a really gullible person.  It is true that McCain publicly condemned the first Swiftboat ad and asked President Bush to put a stop to it.  Well, not only did the Swifties continue with their first ad but they had more.  So what did McCain do?  Did he refuse to campaign for Bush-Cheney in 2004?  Of course not – he actively campaigned for them.  </p>
<p>It does seem that 2008 has started off as a repeat of 2004 – GOP hit men will smear the Democratic candidate for the benefit of the Republican candidate while the Republican candidate pretends to take the high road.  But let’s be clear – McCain could stop this if he wanted to.  But he doesn’t want this to stop.  So when he pretends otherwise – it’s just another of many lies from the Straight Talk express. How stupid do these Republicans think we voters are?</p>

<blockquote><p>Just a few years ago, Holtz-Eakin was offering, well, straight talk about the feasibility of cutting spending anywhere near enough to cover existing costs &#8212; no less new tax cuts such as those his candidate is now proposing. &#8220;While everyone is in favor of eliminating waste,&#8221; he wrote in The Post in February 2006, &#8220;Americans want to protect defense, education, environment, transportation and a myriad of other programs. Congress expended a tremendous effort last week and just barely adopted $39 billion in cuts from projected spending &#8212; less than 7/100ths of 1 percent of GDP.&#8221; Now, Holtz-Eakin airily tosses off promises to cut $60 billion in discretionary spending &#8220;that traces its existence to earmarks&#8221; &#8212; as if that&#8217;s a sensible way to distinguish the necessary from the pork. Just a few years ago, he was acknowledging that new taxes &#8212; not hundreds of billions in additional tax cuts &#8212; would be needed. The &#8220;current level of taxes will fail to cover the type of government Americans have grown used to,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;That&#8217;s bad news because the government will not be getting any smaller. . . . I&#8217;d rather not raise taxes, but unless government remains at its traditional size, I don&#8217;t see any way around it.&#8221; And he was proposing an intelligent way to think about the proper level of taxes. As he told Terry Gross of the radio show &#8220;Fresh Air&#8221; in January 2006, &#8220;We need to . . . put together a set of programs that we believe are sensible programs for the 21st century and then come up with the money to pay for them. But to talk about taxes without deciding what we&#8217;re going to be paying for gets the cart before the horse, and it&#8217;s my biggest frustration with the way Washington has done business for the past five years.&#8221; Let&#8217;s bring back that guy &#8212; and the sensible candidate he used to work for.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/wonkroom/2008/04/23/mccain-deficit-dhe">James Kvaal</a> who adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe that is why Holtz-Eakin’s new argument focuses on McCain’s cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. But McCain has already proposed cutting Social Security and Medicare benefits to restore those programs’ solvency. Does he really want even more cuts — hundreds of billions of dollars more — to pay for his tax cuts &#8230; It seems more likely that Holtz-Eakin is changing the subject, preferring to discuss the long-run entitlement problem rather than the short-run deficit problem. But adding hundreds of billions, even trillions, to the debt now will only make our long-run problems worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is high time for some straight talk from McCain’s economic advisor.</p>

<blockquote><p>The two biggest U.S. warehouse retail chains are limiting how much rice customers can buy because of what Sam&#8217;s Club, a division of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., called on Wednesday &#8220;recent supply and demand trends.&#8221;  The broader chain of Wal-Mart stores has no plans to limit food purchases, however.  The move comes as U.S. rice futures hit a record high amid global food inflation, although one rice expert said the warehouse chains may be reacting less to any shortages than to stockpiling by restaurants and small stores &#8230; USA Rice Federation spokesman David Coia said there is no rice shortage in the United States. &#8220;It&#8217;s possible that small restaurants and bodega-type neighborhood stores may be purchasing rice in larger quantities than they do typically to avoid higher prices,&#8221; Coia said about the warehouse chain restrictions &#8230; At Bangkok Center Grocery, one of the main suppliers of Thai food products in New York City, manager Tom Pongsopon said the price of a 25-pound bag of Jasmine rice at his Chinatown store has gone up from $15 to $20 in a matter of months.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don’t get what Sam’s Club is doing.  Why don’t they just raise the price to their customers now?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/23/AR2008042302906.html?hpid=topnews">Robin Wright</a> discusses the aftermath of the September 6 bombing of a Syrian facility by Israel.  Our argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>A video taken inside a secret Syrian facility last summer convinced the Israeli government and the Bush administration that North Korea was helping to construct a reactor similar to one that produces plutonium for North Korea&#8217;s nuclear arsenal, according to senior U.S. officials who said it would be shared with lawmakers today. The officials said the video of the remote site, code-named Al Kibar by the Syrians, shows North Koreans inside. It played a pivotal role in Israel’s decision to bomb the facility late at night last Sept. 6, a move that was publicly denounced by Damascus but not by Washington. Sources familiar with the video say it also shows that the Syrian reactor core&#8217;s design is the same as that of the North Korean reactor at Youngbyon, including a virtually identical configuration and number of holes for fuel rods. It shows &#8220;remarkable resemblances inside and out to Yongbyon,&#8221; a U.S. intelligence official said. A nuclear weapons specialist called the video &#8220;very, very damning.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Seems we caught them red handed but then there’s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Syrian Ambassador Imad Moustapha yesterday angrily denounced the U.S. and Israeli assertions. &#8220;If they show a video, remember that the U.S. went to the U.N. Security Council and displayed evidence and images about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. I hope the American people will not be as gullible this time around,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>But why trust the Syrians – right?  But then there’s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>But beginning today, intelligence officials will tell members of the House and Senate intelligence, armed services and foreign relations committees that the Syrian facility was not yet fully operational and that there was no uranium for the reactor and no indication of fuel capability, according to U.S. officials and intelligence sources. David Albright , president of Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) and a former U.N. weapons inspector, said the absence of such evidence warrants skepticism that the reactor was part of an active weapons program. &#8220;The United States and Israel have not identified any Syrian plutonium separation facilities or nuclear weaponization facilities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The lack of any such facilities gives little confidence that the reactor is part of an active nuclear weapons program. The apparent lack of fuel, either imported or indigenously produced, also is curious and lowers confidence that Syria has a nuclear weapons program.&#8221; U.S. intelligence officials will also tell the lawmakers that Syria is not rebuilding a reactor at the Al Kibar site. &#8220;The successful engagement of North Korea in the six-party talks means that it was unlikely to have supplied Syria with such facilities or nuclear materials after the reactor site was destroyed,&#8221; Albright said. &#8220;Indeed, there is little, if any, evidence that cooperation between Syria and North Korea extended beyond the date of the destruction of the reactor.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/191013.php">David Kurtz</a> who adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ouch. Isn&#8217;t there some sort of statute of limitations on our goof? I mean it&#8217;s been five years since Colin Powell&#8217;s UN presentation. And look at all we&#8217;ve done since: brought peace and stability to Iraq, made real progress on the Israel-Palestinian conflict, calmed world financial markets. You&#8217;d think they could overlook this one little hiccup in light of all our other good deeds. Not to mention the catharsis we&#8217;ve undergone here at home: the extensive congressional hearings on the misuse of intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq invasion, Dick Cheney&#8217;s teary apology in the well of the Senate, Bush&#8217;s re-election in 2004. Look at the disgrace it has brought to the Republican Party: John McCain is barely running even with the Democrats in national polls. Can&#8217;t the world see? We&#8217;ve changed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update: Recall our Administration claiming there was some video of the Syrian facility?  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20080424/pl_afp/nkoreanuclearweaponsussyria_080424160919">Olivier Knox</a> learns it ain’t quite so:</p>
<blockquote><p>A US official, requesting anonymity, told AFP: &#8220;There are still photographs of the facility as part of the video, but it&#8217;s a video presentation, like a Powerpoint presentation. It&#8217;s not a video of the facility.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,547976,00.html">Spiegal Online International</a> carries this article on Arctic research. I immediately thought of <a href="http://www.globalwarmingclearinghouse.blogspot.com/">Global warming clearing house</a> and methane production, with affection.</p>
<blockquote><p>Researchers have found alarming evidence that the frozen Arctic floor has started to thaw and release long-stored methane gas. The results could be a catastrophic warming of the earth, since methane is a far more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. But can the methane also be used as fuel.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always been a disturbing what-if scenario for climate researchers: Gas hydrates stored in the Arctic ocean floor &#8212; hard clumps of ice and methane, conserved by freezing temperatures and high pressure &#8212; could grow unstable and release massive amounts of methane into the atmosphere. Since methane is a potent greenhouse gas, more worrisome than carbon dioxide, the result would be a drastic acceleration of global warming. Until now this idea was mostly academic; scientists had warned that such a thing could happen. Now it seems more likely that it will.</p>
<p>Russian polar scientists have strong evidence that the first stages of melting are underway. They&#8217;ve studied largest shelf sea in the world, off the coast of Siberia, where the Asian continental shelf stretches across an underwater area six times the size of Germany, before falling off gently into the Arctic Ocean. The scientists are presenting their data from this remote, thinly-investigated region at the annual conference of the European Geosciences Union this week in Vienna.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note the fact that undersea methane is only a little below freezing by about 1.5 degrees C, and Arctic tundra methane may be 12.5 or so below freezing. Something new to think about regarding my property on the Hudson Bay.</p>
<p>Can I sell the methane as fuel fast enough to avert sea level rise as the southwest passage stays open longer? What is forcing, trend, and noise? Is there an inverse relationship between scientificly expressed noise and political noise, and does it have anything to do with climate and weather?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/04/080423181652.htm">Science Daily</a> reported more increases as well globally in gasses after a quiet period of a few years for unknown reasons.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2008/01/uncertainty-noise-and-the-art-of-model-data-comparison/">Real Climate</a> article and comments especially between Pielke and Gavin are worth the time and thought to consider. There is a good list to be gleaned on thoughts regarding model(s) verification and use, forcast verification, and data series.</p>
<blockquote><p>‘AGW’ is not a fundamental theory in and of itself, it is the conclusion of many different lines of evidence and basic physics. There aren’t going to be any major revisions of HITRAN or radiative transfer theory that will make any difference to forcing related to GHG increases, but there’s plenty of uncertainty in cloud feedbacks or aerosol-cloud interactions or the impact of unresolved ocean dynamics when it comes to the climate response. Come up with a specific hypothesis that you think we should be testing and we can discuss. &#8211; gavin]comment #169 response to general skeptic rejection of climate science.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is my impression there is no scientific &#8216;neutral&#8217; or more accurately (news wise) &#8216;natural&#8217; trend lines established to be argued about, period. And predictions of forty years ago are hardly relevant to the scientific interest of today involving so many different areas of interest and discovery as methodologies of measurement are refined, much less discovering new things to measure to begin with.</p>
<p>Update: I re-arranged paragraph order for clarity.</p>

                                <p>Ilsm continues his whittle the beak series:</p>
<p>Professor Theodore Postol, MIT, is a continuing and outspoken critic of Missile Defense Agency, Star Wars and numerous related components such as Patriot and newer science projects. He made news in 1992 pointing out that 37 of 38 disintegrating SCUD missiles fired by Iraq during Gulf War II were missed by the patriot interceptor missiles.</p>
<p>Postol&#8217;s latest <a href="http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2008/04/15/troubling_questions_about_missile_defense/">Op Ed Apr 15 2008 in the Boston Globe</a>, is about the utter dismissal of outcomes of star wars tests of interceptors against &#8216;decoys&#8217;. </p>
<p>He states that of two tests attempted neither gave any positive results and failed against the least difficult decoys. He also states that there are allegations that the missile defense agency hid these dismal results and caused researchers to eliminate all references to failed intercept tests.</p>
<p>This shows one of the great foundations of weapon testing: tests &#8216;not failed&#8217; are passed. Goes for tests not done and ignored. </p>
<p>Missile defense agency&#8217;s very busy public affairs office responded that there have been 5 tests of decoyed targets and all have provided &#8220;actionable&#8221; results. Got lots of things to fix. Tests are supposed to show things work, not show what is wrong with the object being tested. There is huge scrap and rework, and it is far more expensive to fix design errors after the system is in the field, but the tests succeed in justifying more money for these wooden beaks.</p>
<p>Star wars is so important it will be funded, built and deployed in Poland and be as useful as the Maginot Line.</p>
<p>Tests are success oriented. Never will a failure slow the profits. Disregard the failed tests full speed ahead! Scrap and rework is business development, revenue growth reward for failure.<br />This is not new, in Fall 2000 the Director of Operational Test stated that the MV 22 Osprey did not complete effectiveness tests and failed reliability and maintenance tests. The DoD was going to build it anyway, despite the negative report until an MV 22 crashed killing the crew in Dec 2000.</p>
<p>Congress needs to sustain these superlative design companies. As the interceptors are deployed no tests have been done to show that the interceptors can launch from alert with no script, will complete a mission cycle and get to target if needed. All the tests are highly scripted, and look like shuttle launches delayed for maintenance weather or what ever. Good thing North Korea cannot feed their children lest they might nuke us through star wars.</p>
<p>Might as well whittle a beak for all the good the untested interceptors will do.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>

                                <p>Coal <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article3259985.ece">shortages</a>? China? China is a net exporter of coal, I thought.</p>
<blockquote><p>China is experiencing an acute power shortage with a nationwide electricity shortfall at 70 gigawatts, the equivalent of almost Britain’s entire generating capacity.<br />State media has described the crisis as China’s worst-ever power shortage. With coal prices soaring and supplies disrupted by some of the most severe winter weather in years, it is certainly the most acute since 2004 when demand outstripped supply by 40 gigawatts. A rush for individual generators and to buy diesel to fuel them sent state firms into the international markets, provoking a spurt in crude oil prices.<br />China is the world’s top coal producer and consumer and remained a net exporter of the fuel in 2007 but its net exports plunged to just 2 million tonnes, compared with 25.1 million tonnes in 2006.<br />Chronic winter shortfalls of coal, which fuels 78 per cent of China’s electricity supply, have been aggravated by transport disruptions due to unusually heavy snow across central, eastern and northern China. The unusually icy temperatures have prompted a surge in demand for power as people try to keep warm. </p></blockquote>
<p>And <a href="http://rusmet.com/news.php?id=13327">here</a>:<br />
<blockquote>It is reported that China, the world&#8217;s largest coal consuming nation, used more coal than it produced in 2007 and will stay short through at least 2010.</p>
<p>Mr Wu Chenghou executive director of the Coal Sale and Transportation Association of China said China&#8217;s demand for coal is expected to rise to 2.76 billion tonnes in 2008 from 2.62 billion tonnes in 2007.</p>
<p>Mr Wu estimated that China produced 2.58 billion tonnes of coal in 2007, slightly above an estimate of 2.52 billion tonnes issued by the State Administration of Work Safety. He did not comment on whether the country had drawn down coal stocks in 2007 to remain a net exporter, despite producing less than it consumed. China has not yet issued official output data for 2007 and often revises that figure several times.</p>
<p>Mr Wu at an industry conference said that by 2010, China&#8217;s coal consumption will reach 3.06 billion in 2010 up 10% compared with last year more than will be satisfied by domestic production of between 2.9 billion and 3 billion tonnes. He said Coal output in 2008 could be reduced by a number of factors, including a crackdown on mines that are unsafe, polluting or wasteful of energy.</p></blockquote>
<p>And it is not just <a href="http://www.kuna.net.kw/NewsAgenciesPublicSite/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=1886907&#038;Language=en">coal</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>China, the world&#8217;s second-biggest energy consumer, faces a shortage of 6 billion tons of oil and 600 million cubic meters of natural gas over the next few years, as the country has entered a phase of rapid mineral consumption amid its rapid industrialization, the official media reported Monday.<br />&#8220;An insufficient supply of resources has become a major bottleneck for the country&#8217;s development,&#8221; Wang Min, vice-minister of land and resources, told a national geological survey conference in Beijing, according to the China Daily. Given the goal of doubling the nation&#8217;s gross domestic output, China is expected to consume 510 million tons of oil, 20 million cubic meters of natural gas, 3.7 billion tons of coal, 400 million tons of steel, 6.6 million tons of copper and 13 million tons of alumina by 2010, Wang noted.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rapid industrialization has a price&#8230;for China and the rest of us: Another slice of insufficient resources&#8211;at least for the present&#8211;that is sure to drive up prices world-wide.</p>

<p>So McCain is reaching across the political spectrum here but how’s he going to pay for his war on poverty.  Oh yea – tax cuts for the rich.  I get it!</p>
