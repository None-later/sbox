                                <p>The latest version is courtesy of <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/05/could-someone-explain-stolper-samuelson.html">James Surowiecki</a>.  When I try to make the <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/05/could-someone-explain-stolper-samuelson.html">Stolper-Samuelson</a> argument that wages in the apparel sector fall by more than apparel prices fell, James insists that <a href="http://faculty.chicagogsb.edu/christian.broda/website/research/unrestricted/Broda_TradeInequality.pdf">Christian Broda and John Romalis</a> addressed that in Inequality and Prices: Does China Benefit the Poor in America?:</p>
<blockquote><p>The debate on trade and wages in the U.S. has entirely focused on the impact that trade with developing countries has on the wages of the unskilled in America. This debate has overlooked the impact that trade has on prices of the goods consumed by different income groups. In particular, since developing countries typically produce low quality goods that are disproportionately consumed by the poor in America, this implies that inequality measures that do not correct for differences in the basket of goods consumed by rich and poor neglect this “price” effect of trade.</p></blockquote>
<p>While I concede we should look at both the price effect and the wage effect, doesn’t the Stolper-Samuelson effect consider both?  James did offer this comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>As for quoting Stolper-Samuelson, there are fewer than 900,000 apparel workers left in the U.S. There are 30 million+ low-income American consumers, the vast majority of whom don&#8217;t now and in fact never did work in industries that compete with China, who reap sizeable benefits &#8212; as Broda and Romalis document &#8212; from the lower prices that free trade with China has empirically brought. If you want to make the case that the costs to those apparel workers today (and to those who used to work in the apparel industry)outweigh the benefits to the consumers, then do it empirically, documenting the costs and benefits. Merely citing S+S doesn&#8217;t help you.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, it is true that BLS cites that there were only 540,000 workers as of April 2008 in the following sectors: textile mills, textile mill products, apparel, and leather and allied products.  This is down from 1,822,000 as of January 1990 as our apparel sector has laid off many workers who likely found employment elsewhere but often at even lower wages.  As <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/261">Paul Krugman</a> noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 1995 I also believed that the effects of trade on inequality would eventually hit a limit, because at a certain point advanced economies would run out of labour-intensive industries to lose – more formally, that we’d reach a point of complete specialisation, beyond which further growth in trade would have no further effects on wages. What has happened instead is that the limit keeps being pushed out, as trade creates “new” labour-intensive industries through the fragmentation of production.  For example, the manufacture of microprocessors for personal computers is clearly a highly sensitive, skill-intensive process. Intel’s microprocessor production, however, now takes place in two stages: the “fabs,” which print the circuits on disks of silicon, are all located in high-wage advanced countries, but the assembly and testing, in which those disks are cut into individual chips and tested to be sure that they work, is conducted in China, Malaysia, and the Philippines.  Outsourcing of services, in both directions, adds to the possibilities of unequalising trade. The skill-intensive pieces of production processes that mainly take place in the third world are often now located in the OECD – for example, Lenovo, the Chinese computer company, has its executive headquarters in North Carolina.  What all this comes down to is that it’s no longer safe to assert, as we could a dozen years ago, that the effects of trade on income distribution in wealthy countries are fairly minor. There’s now a good case that they are quite big, and getting bigger.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – focusing on those 540,000 apparel workers to access the impact on wages is incomplete and highly misleading.</p>

That is we are not talking about three random academics writing some paper, instead these are policy players working at the highest levels, no matter who wins this fall one or more of them will be sitting at the table when Social Security policy is hammered out. So LMS matters. A lot.</p>
<p>But first lets define some terms and lay out some baseline numbers. Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is normally associated with Trust Fund Depletion which is currently projected for 2041. Although people tend to refer to this event with reckless language like &#8216;broke&#8217;, &#8216;bankrupt&#8217; or &#8216;dead broke&#8217; which leads others to conclusions that &#8216;Social Security will not be there for me&#8217; or &#8216;no check&#8217;, ten seconds of informed thought tells us this is nonsense. As long at the payroll tax exists some level of benefits can be paid out and the Trustees tell us each year what that level is. With the 2008 Report the Trustees tell us that under Intermediate Cost assumptions that the benefit check will be cut sometime in 2041 to 78% of the scheduled benefit. Now given that the scheduled benefit would be 160% in real terms relative to the one a similarly situated retiree gets today and that 78% of 160% = 125% or a check 25% better in real terms than the one my Mom gets today some might question the whole notion of &#8216;crisis&#8217;. A topic that can be discussed in comments. But for now lets run with the number.</p>
<p>Okay so &#8216;crisis&#8217; is defined as 78%. What would a &#8216;fix&#8217; be. Well I am going to keep running with the Trustees here, they would define this is terms of Short Term and Long Term Actuarial Balance, meaning Social Security projected to end each year of the next ten or alternatively seventy-five years with a one year reserve. Which translates to 100% of the schedule. Moreover they tell us exactly what the cost of that fix would be if we chose to take a tax only approach. Per the 2008 Report that fix would require an immediate increase in the payroll tax of 1.7% which would take the FICA rate to 14.1%. We should note that when LMS was drafted the gap was 1.92%.</p>
<p>So now to LMS and Table 1 above, especially columns two and four where you have both halves of a couple surviving. One thing strikes you right away, LMS doesn&#8217;t actually promise you a fix as defined particularly for low earners, it only partially fills the gap. While some might be tempted to say &#8216;better something than nothing&#8217;, the devil is always in the details. A cost/benefit analysis of LMS lies below the fold.</p>
<p>Which takes us to Table 2 which scores the impact of LMS on the Trust Fund but which doesn&#8217;t tell the whole story. LMS at its core relies on PRAs (Personal Retirement Accounts) which are essentially government run IRAs that are considered to be outside the Trust Fund itself. If we take the totality of LMS what are the tax and benefit implications?</p>
<p>First LMS proposes a 1.5% across the board increase in payroll tax all of which gets put into the PRA. Additionally it proposes a partial lifting of the payroll cap for an additional 1.0% payroll equivalent. Which is to say that it proposes a 2.5% tax solution to a problem that had been scored at 1.92% and now is down to 1.7%. Given that we could achieve a &#8216;fix&#8217; as defined above for less than LMS it is clear that for the authors their &#8216;Reform&#8217; does not equate to our &#8216;fix&#8217;. But it gets even more interesting on the benefit side.</p>
<p>Along with the 2.5% total increase in payroll tax LMS also proposes a cut in the benefit from traditional Social Security benefit formula of 2.08% along with an increase in retirement age for an additional .68% for a total benefit cut of 2.7% once again much more than what we have described as &#8216;crisis&#8217; to begin with. So what we have is a tax increase that would more than &#8216;fix&#8217; &#8216;crisis&#8217; as we have defined these terms along with benefit cuts that would fix &#8216;crisis&#8217; in place. Which puts in place the dual questions &#8216;What does LMS actually accomplish?&#8217; and &#8216;Why should wage workers fund it to the equivalent of 5.2% of payroll (2.5% in taxes and 2.7% in cuts)?&#8217;</p>
<p>At this point serious students might want to follow the link and read the plan which is only nine pages. The first six and a half pages contain the pain. The putative gains start on page seven.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sustainable solvency is achieved&#8217;. The net result from LMS would be to put Social Security into a .22% payroll surplus when examined from the Social Security and hence General Fund side of the equation. That this comes at a cost of 5.2% total to workers when they could get a better outcome at 1.92% (then) or 1.7% (now) is apparently just the burden we owe to future generations. Because on examination it is clear that the authors of LMS have a quite different definition of &#8216;solvency&#8217; than say Coberly or I do. We like the fact that Social Security is a PayGo insurance plan with an intergenerational bargain of &#8216;you paid for my parents, I&#8217;ll pay for you, your kids can pay for me, and all with better real results as time goes on&#8217;. For the authors this situation is intolerable. Why? Well a fine topic for discussion in comments.</p>
<p>&#8220;Fiscally responsible plan&#8221; Here I think the authors let the cat out of the bag, note how they word the issue (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>The plan puts great emphasis on fiscal responsibility – borrowing less from general revenues than any other plan that has been scored by the Social Security actuaries in recent years.  Table 3 compares the LMS plan with other recent Social Security reform plan.  The first column compares general fund transfers to the OASDI Trust Funds.  This is one measure of how much a plan relies upon unspecified resources from outside of Social Security to bring the system into balance.  The LMS plan does not rely at all on general fund transfers, and instead uses changes to <br />benefits and revenues to bring Social Security into balance.</p></blockquote>
<p>. This is rather odd. Under current law there is no question of Social Security borrowing anything from the General Fund, the obligation is the other direction in the form of repaying the money borrowed from current Social Security surpluses. The LMS formulation builds in a tricky duality. First it asserts that the unfunded liability beyond 2041 is real enough that the government would fill compelled to backfill it with &#8216;borrowing, then it writes it off anyway by proposing even bigger cuts sooner. To me that seems special pleading.</p>
<p>&#8220;Many practical reforms are included&#8221;. All these reforms relate to administration of the plan and none actually to the issue of retirement security itself.</p>
<p>&#8220;Economically beneficial&#8221; On my reading of the text on page nine this translates to &#8216;exercising fiscal restraint on Congress&#8217;, a good idea in itself but one that is difficult to justify by placing the entire cost on wage workers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Balanced compromise&#8221;. I am not sure how a 5.2% bill for a problem scored at 1.92% is either balanced or any kind of a compromise, not at least from the perspective of workers. To me the whole thing looks like just trying to find the easiest path to screw over any concept of Social Democracy in favor for a everyman for himself philosophy typical of the Economic Right. In context &#8216;bi-partisan&#8217; here is defined as compromise between the conservatives and the DLC/centrist wing of the Democratic Party, the concept that the New Dealers should have some voice is dismissed out of hand.</p>

                                <p>In honor of <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/05/cross-price-elasticity-of-demand-v.html">Greg Mankiw</a>, maybe <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121134017363909773.html?mod=todays_us_page_one">Yochi Dreazen</a> should have called this Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand VI:</p>
<blockquote><p>With fuel prices soaring, the U.S. military, the country&#8217;s largest single consumer of oil, is turning into an alternative-fuels pioneer.  In March, Air Force Capt. Rick Fournier flew a B-1 stealth bomber code-named Dark 33 across this sprawling proving ground, to confirm for the first time that a plane could break the sound barrier using synthetic jet fuel. A similar formula &#8212; a blend of half-synthetic and half-conventional petroleum &#8212; has been used in some South African commercial airliners for years, but never in a jet going so fast … With oil&#8217;s multiyear ascent showing no signs of stopping &#8212; crude futures set another record Tuesday, closing at $129.07 a barrel in New York trading &#8212; energy security has emerged as a major concern for the Pentagon.  The U.S. military consumes 340,000 barrels of oil a day, or 1.5% of all of the oil used in the country. The Defense Department&#8217;s overall energy bill was $13.6 billion in 2006, the latest figure available &#8212; almost 25% higher than the year before. The Air Force&#8217;s bill for jet fuel alone has tripled in the past four years. When the White House submitted its latest budget request for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it tacked on a $2 billion surcharge for rising fuel costs.  Synthetic fuel, which can be made from coal or natural gas, is expensive now, but could cost far less than the current price of oil if it&#8217;s mass-produced.  Just as important, the military is increasingly concerned that its dependence on oil represents a strategic threat. U.S. forces in Iraq alone consume 40,000 barrels of oil a day trucked in from neighboring countries, and would be paralyzed without it. Energy-security advocates warn that terrorist attacks on oil refineries or tankers could cripple military operations around the world. &#8220;The endgame is to wean the dependence on foreign oil,&#8221; says Air Force Assistant Secretary William Anderson.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/05/war-for-oil-or-oil-for-war.html">Michael Perelman</a> has another take on the fact that the Iraq campaign is consuming so much oil:</p>
<blockquote><p>I suspect that these figures would be what uniformed personnel consumed. Maybe somebody here knows, but I feel fairly confident that contractors in Iraq &#8212; even contractors carrying out military missions &#8212; consume oil that escapes these estimates.  Wasting oil is nothing compared to wasting lives, but even so I can think of better uses for 340,000 barrels of oil a day.</p></blockquote>
<p>This war not only disrupted Iraqi oil supplies, it has also increased the demand for oil.  Isn’t it time to end this idiotic adventure before <a href="http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jQ7to4Zhf0BTz9HqeVbjvvgx9LUQD90QS17O0">Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani</a> succumbs to pressures to declare a fatwa on our troops:</p>
<blockquote><p>Iraq&#8217;s most influential Shiite cleric has been quietly issuing religious edicts declaring that armed resistance against U.S.-led foreign troops is permissible — a potentially significant shift by a key supporter of the Washington-backed government in Baghdad.The edicts, or fatwas, by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani suggest he seeks to sharpen his long-held opposition to American troops and counter the populist appeal of his main rivals, firebrand Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr and his Mahdi Army militia.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I keep hearing on CNBC and reading at some blogs that if cars get better mileage that people  will drive more by enough to offset the improved mileage.</p>
<p>I can see that people could drive more because of the savings.  But to argue that reducing mileage by 20%, for example will lead to people increasing their driving by more then 20% seems like a very questionable conclusion. I&#8217;m willing to listen to an argument that increasing gas mileage would be partially offset by increased driving, but not that the responses would be more than 100%.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea of the original source or research of this belief by so many Republicans, Conservatives and Libertarians?</p>
<p>Is it just another Wall Street Journal editorial page finding that is too good to be true?</p>

<blockquote><p>In 1961, Dwight D. Eisenhower, in his famous farewell address as president, warned of the &#8220;acquisition of unwarranted influence&#8221; by what he called the &#8220;military-industrial complex&#8221; in the United States. Today, however, the &#8220;large arms industry&#8221; of Eisenhower&#8217;s day is only part of a complex equation. Civilian firms such as PepsiCo and IBM form the backbone of what more accurately can be described as a &#8220;military-corporate complex.&#8221; These businesses allow the Pentagon to function, to make war and to carry out foreign occupations.</p>
<p>For example, in 2006 (the last year for which official figures are available), PepsiCo and IBM ranked among the Pentagon&#8217;s top 100 contractors, taking in $286,696,943 and $291,825,309, respectively. This was no aberration. The previous year, they received $233,053,993 and $382,408,117 each, according to Department of Defense documents. In fact, both companies have been defense contractors every year since at least 2000. And there isn&#8217;t anything special or odd about PepsiCo or IBM, when it comes to the Pentagon.</p>
<p>Almost a decade after Eisenhower&#8217;s farewell address, there were still only 22,000 prime contractors doing business with the Department of Defense. Today, that number tops 47,000. While the well-known giant arms makers &#8212; Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Northrop Grumman and General Dynamics &#8212; remain the largest contractors, they are dwarfed by the sheer number of fellow contractors from all imaginable economic sectors.</p>
<p>These stretch from coast to coast and around the globe, from entertainment giants such as Columbia TriStar and Twentieth Century Fox to auto-making titans Ford and General Motors to Big Pharma power players such as Pfizer. Even the Krispy Kreme Doughnuts chain took in almost $500,000 from the Pentagon in 2006, while Coca-Cola cleaned up with more than $100 million in taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>In 2006, the Pentagon&#8217;s list of its top 100 suppliers also included such well-known civilian firms as Tyson Foods ($335,239,095), Goodrich Corp. ($344,091,017), Procter &#038; Gamble ($362,461,808), Kraft Foods ($500,799,104), Dell ($636,343,593), ExxonMobil ($1,176,354,936), FedEx ($1,303,032,027) and General Electric ($2,327,705,161). Also on the Pentagon&#8217;s 2006 payroll were such often-ignored defense contractors as the animated mouse-house, the Walt Disney Co.; iPod-maker Apple; sunglasses purveyor Oakley; cocoa giant Nestle; ketchup producer Heinz; and chocolate bar maker Hershey.</p>
<p>These are, in fact, today&#8217;s &#8220;typical defense contractors.&#8221; They are the companies that regularly take in tax-funded payouts from the Pentagon for services and goods (chiefly for the more than 1.3 million active members of the armed services). Few realize the actual look and shape of the new &#8220;militarized&#8221; U.S. economy. It&#8217;s not just the classic &#8220;permanent armaments industry&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s civilian and it&#8217;s widespread.</p></blockquote>
<p>Such large sums of money through privatizing supply makes for interesting connections with products of everyday civilian life.  What I have not been able to find are data on the weight of soldiers just prior to going on tour to the weight of soldiers just after finishing their tours&#8230;whoppers and pepsi rations in between.</p>

<blockquote><p>I think Barack Obama has accidentally discovered the easiest way to defeat John McCain this November: make him mad. We&#8217;ve all heard the stories about McCain&#8217;s legendarily cranky temper, and he sure showed where those stories came from on Thursday when he erupted after Obama had the temerity to disagree with him about Jim Webb&#8217;s GI Bill extension. Get a grip, Senator.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/john_mccain_/2008/05/bad_day_for_john_mccain_part_ii_anger_management.php">Mark Kleiman</a> has the details.  But I guess screwing veterans is fiscally necessary if one is adamant about paying for those tax cuts.  After all – the GOP mantra in late 2001 when they were pushing for more tax cuts for the rich was “do it for the troops”.</p>

                                <p>Mirror mirror on the wall, how can a bank can make easy money for all? Step forward Citigroup and its stalwart Falcon hedge fund.</p>
<p>Banks take out life insurance policies on its employees. When the employee dies, the bank collects&#8211;tax free. BOLI accounts, they are called (Bank Owed Life Insurance).</p>
<p>And how does this little gimmick generate cash? Hedge fund operators, using the hedge fund as the support vehicle, garner, I am sure, very nice bonuses. The banks, of course, now have a tax dodge.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23731045-36375,00.html">Additionally</a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;many banks have grown aggressive with their BOLI programs, putting premiums into investment vehicles that let the banks record quarterly profits &#8212; or losses. </p></blockquote>
<p>Smiles and high fives all around, I am sure.</p>
<p>Of course, when Falcon stumbled, so did the banks, Wachovia and Fifth Third among them.</p>
<blockquote><p>Falcon began stumbling last &#8230; autumn and by March 31 was valued at 20 per cent of the original value, according to Citigroup documents. </p>
<p>Fifth Third, which reaped $US238 million in gains on its BOLI portfolio in a three-year period, suffered a BOLI-related loss of $US177 million in the fourth quarter and $US152 million loss in 2008&#8217;s first quarter. </p>
<p>At Wachovia, Falcon&#8217;s woes caused the bank&#8217;s first-quarter loss to widen to $US708 million from its previously announced $US393 million loss.</p>
<p>In its lawsuit, Fifth Third alleges that Transamerica Life Insurance and Clark Consulting, both units of Dutch insurer Aegon, &#8220;utterly failed to properly manage and monitor&#8221; premiums that were invested in Falcon. Citigroup is not named as a defendant. A Fifth Third spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We live, apparently, in a financial sewer, with rats and other vermin looking for tasty meals. Occasionally, they gnaw on one another. Yet we celebrate the massive bonuses that all this innovation brings. Money is being made. This is what a bank does.</p>
<p>I remember that marvelous Smith Barney ad: &#8220;<i>We make money the old-fashion way: We earn it.</i>&#8221; Smith Barney is, of course, &#8220;the global private wealth management unit of Citigroup.&#8221; In an age of gloss and glamour, the moral compass spins wildly.</p>
<p>Personally, I would not trust these rascals with my grandchildren&#8217;s piggy banks.  I think it is time to flush the sewers and start fresh.  It is time to pull the plug on these financial geniuses and the climate of greed that has spawned them.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Reader Arne, a long time and well informed commenter submitted to Tuesday&#8217;s Social Security post a list of seven deceptively simple in form questions to get my take on them. Which I gave in comments. Unfortunately what HaloScan gives it can take away and a time this morning both his questions and my answers had vanished. Well they came back and I thought it useful to front page them and invite readers either to attempt their own answers or comment on mine.</p>
<p>Remember the rules. Anyone can ask for a response to a question or argument. No one has the right to demand one. Silence in this case does not equate to consent.That said what is on your mind? Anything related to Social Security is fair game. But first over to Arne.</p>
<p>Here are some questions I think are interesting, but I would prefer to see Bruce post them with his thoughts and for others to try to stay tightly on-topic. </p>
<p>1) What should we do if the SSA intermedicate forecast is right? When and how would we change? <br />2) Which is really more important, productivity or demographics?<br />3) Given that the TF lasts at least 20 more years, is moving (some of) it from US Treasuries to equities a good idea? How does that change with LC instead of IC?<br />4) Is solvency relevent? {mild edit to remove a side irrelevant side issue} <br />5) Are the stochastic projections (Appendix E) meaningful?<br />6) What do the 1984 and 1985 reports show us about intent?<br />7) Why did the TF ratio outperform expectations in the late 90&#8217;s? Can it do so again?</p>
<p>1. Well there are two answers to that. One would rely on what I call Rosser&#8217;s Equation and point out that &#8216;crisis&#8217; means a 78% result of a benefit scheduled at 160% relative to what similarly situated retirees get today. Since 78% of 160% = 125% and the event if and when will come after I am gone, I don&#8217;t see why I should get exercised about this one way or another. Particularly if the plan to avoid sticker shock is just to phase it in faster. So one perfectly good response is Nothing.</p>
<p>The second answer would be to point out with Coberly that a tax based solution is in fact pretty cheap. The current payroll gap is down to 1.7% of payroll which for a household of $50,000 would require an $850 a year fix, or half that if you examine that from an employer/employee split. But as I argue in Cost of Inactivity the trend short term is good and mathematically calculates out to Nothing for now as well.</p>
<p>The legal answer is to wait until the Social Security system falls out of Short Term Actuarial Balance. Under Intermediate Cost assumptions the TF ratio falls below 100 in around 2036, meaning the system would fail the test some nine years earlier or in 2027 which would leave 14 years to 2041 to come to a policy decision, which would be plenty of time and a much more informed information environment. Of course if depletion continues to move out in time then so would this decision point. So once again the answer to your question in the here and now is Nothing. Ask me again in 2027.</p>
<p>2. For decision making? Productivity. Because the Demographics are already built into the model and do not vary much over the short term that will be determinative, which is to say the 2009 to 2012 time period. Fluctuations in fertility obviously only manifest themselves 21 years or so out of phase. Whereas year over year productivity can vary greatly.</p>
<p>3. Diversification of the Trust Fund is in my view a good thing, though equities would not be my choice of asset class. The question is to some degree moot under IC. Surpluses start shrinking after 2017 and vanish after 2023. Given that fairly short investment window the difference in yield probably wouldn&#8217;t offset the risk of markets crashing at just the wrong time. We would be a little embarrassed if the Great Crash of 2023 wiped out most of our portfolio just as we needed to cash parts of it in. Under LC I would argue that diversification is almost an absolute necessity in that it avoids the Interest on Interest problem. If we assume Low Cost and took the current surplus and invested it in outside assets and then reinvested the earnings we would have a chance to really build a portfolio. Under Low Cost the time to tap the Trust Fund portfolio does not start until 2023 and at a much lower rate amounting to 25% of the interest accrued from a portfolio of Special Treasuries, presumedly something less with better yielding outside assets. You can do quite a bit with a reinvestment rate of say 80% of earnings. As to asset class I would pick school and transportation bonds which would serve to create jobs, lower borrowing costs to states and local jurisdictions, yet maintain the predictability of Treasuries.</p>
<p>4. Solvency is relevant because opponents of Social Security have framed the argument in those terms. They chose not to fight this out on straight out ideological, pro market terms. Instead they sold the message of &#8216;bankrupt&#8217;. I can only fight on the battlefield in play and for the most part that is one of Solvency.</p>
<p>5. I don&#8217;t find the Stochastic Projections compelling. I am even less a statistician than I am an economist but the following passage was troubling. Perhaps you could explain it:</p>
<p>&#8220;Each time-series equation is designed such that, in the absence of random variation, the value of the variable would equal the value assumed under the intermediate set of assumptions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The language in Appendix E is rather opaque, perhaps deliberately so, but it seems to build in the assumption that is actually in challenge, that Intermediate Cost is overall a reasonable median. But really the question of the Stochastics are above my pay grade.</p>
<p>6. Well the unkind answer would be to say &#8216;Look&#8217; and link to http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/index.html but I went ahead and checked the 1985 Summary. They essentially gave the system a clean bill of health with the actuarial deficit of Intermediate II-B only being .41% while the 1985 definition of &#8216;close actuarial balance&#8217; was &#8216;estimated average annual income rate between 95% and 105% of the average cost rate&#8217;. So I would sum their intent as &#8216;maybe we fixed it, but lets keep a close eye on it&#8217;. Because they were only .09% of payroll of falling outside their preferred band.<br />http://www.ssa.gov/history/pdf/1985.pdf</p>
<p>7. Well that one is easy. Whether you take as your key variable Real GDP, Real Wage, population in employment all were way ahead of expectations. Whether the late nineties could happen again depends of what you think caused it to happen in the first place, a question which has economists of all ideological types coming up with different answers. Personally I am a little more optimistic that those times could come again. Then again they are not needed to achieve Low Cost results. Low Cost only assumes 2.8% ultimate GDP and 2.0% productivity both well below the rates we were seeing in the late 90s. Which is probably the least understood thing about Low Cost. In historical context its numbers seem to be pretty low hanging fruit. To me anyway, I am still waiting for someone to explain why no year in the future could possibly be as good as 2006. I don&#8217;t need to appeal back to 1999.</p>
<p>Fire away.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601039&#038;refer=columnist_pauly&#038;sid=aXvqxgei7srU">Bloomberg</a> carries an article noting that credit was tight but there appeared to be plenty of money for commodities.  Here is another piece of the action.</p>
<blockquote><p>Credit is scarce but not capital. Mortgage-ravaged banks and Wall Street firms often have to borrow from the Federal Reserve, as lender of last resort, to meet current bills. They have no problem at all raising big sums from investors for future use.<br />In recent months, these financial companies have sold $262 billion in new securities &#8212; much of it common and preferred stock &#8212; according to Bloomberg data. This gives them capital they need to offset losses from subprime mortgages that now total $343 billion.</p>
<p>Investors obviously don&#8217;t see this as throwing good money after bad: They eagerly buy more shares than the companies initially planned to sell.</p>
<p>Late last month, Citigroup Inc., the biggest U.S. bank by assets, planned to sell $3 billion in common stock. Investor demand boosted the total by 50 percent to $4.5 billion. People bought without assurance that the bank&#8217;s need for capital was sated.</p>
<p>Citigroup so far is the champion capital-raiser, refurbishing its balance sheet with $44 billion in new money. There&#8217;s symmetry here. Citigroup&#8217;s subprime-related losses are also the highest, at $41 billion.</p>
<p>American International Group Inc., the biggest insurance company by assets, got stuck in the subprime mire too, by guaranteeing payment on loans. The company had a first-quarter net loss of $7.8 billion. Still, last week AIG said it had raised more than the $12.5 billion in new capital it had planned.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Stocks and Bonds</p>
<p>The company said it sold $11.9 billion in common shares and units that can be converted into common and might offer more of both to meet investors&#8217; demand. AIG also sold $4 billion in bonds. AIG&#8217;s loss and new capital figures aren&#8217;t included in the Bloomberg data cited above.</p>
<p>Though others damaged by subprime losses have cut their dividends to conserve cash, AIG on May 8 raised its quarterly dividend to 22 cents a share from 20 cents. The company is in effect raising money from new investors to pay off old stockholders &#8212; a modern-day Ponzi scheme.</p>
<p>Wachovia Corp., the fourth-largest U.S. bank, was able to sell $8 billion in common and preferred stock last month, $1 billion more than planned. No matter that the bank was absorbing losses from once-popular mortgages that allowed homeowners to skip some interest payments and add the amount to principal.</p>
<p>Washington Mutual Inc., the biggest U.S. savings and loan, with subprime losses so far of $8.3 billion, sold $7 billion in common and convertible preferred shares in April to investors led by David Bonderman&#8217;s TPG Inc. The company has raised a total of $10 billion in new capital.</p>
<p>Real Money</p>
<p>UBS AG, Switzerland&#8217;s biggest bank, has reported $38 billion in write-offs and other losses from mortgages. It has raised $28 billion in capital. Merrill Lynch &#038; Co., the third- biggest U.S. securities firm, has brought in $18 billion in new money against its subprime-related losses of $32 billion.</p>
<p>The parade will continue. Freddie Mac, which supports the U.S. mortgage market by purchasing loans from lenders, said last week it plans to sell $5.5 billion of common and preferred shares soon.</p>
<p>Freddie Mac and its sister government-sponsored company Fannie Mae may be in the market for money repeatedly in the months ahead as the U.S. government looks to them to keep the mortgage market liquid.</p>
<p>Investors may feel they can&#8217;t lose by putting money into financial companies. The Federal Reserve &#8212; by engineering the takeover of Bear Stearns Cos. by JPMorgan Chase &#038; Co. in March &#8211; &#8211; showed that no company big enough to have a major impact on the banking system will be allowed to fail.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s more, both Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson have urged banks and investment firms to raise more capital so that they can lend more and boost the economy. People also may be intrigued by their ability to buy stock at a haircut from the market price.</p>
<p>Still, when they buy common shares and preferred stock convertible into common, they dilute the earnings potential of all stockholders. And when the companies have to sell more shares in the future, that process starts all over again.</p>
