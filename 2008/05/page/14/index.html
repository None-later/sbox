<blockquote><p>Repeal the gas tax for the summer, and pay for the repeal by cutting domestic discretionary spending so that the transportation infrastructure trust fund would not be hurt.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok – stop laughing at this one as <a href="http://www.amconmag.com/larison/2008/05/06/the-nine-ineffectual-habits-of-republican-pandering">Daniel Larison</a> has so much more:</p>
<blockquote><p>Newt Gingrich is back to haunt us again, this time offering up nine panderific ideas that reek of the desperation of a party with no ideas–and he’s supposed to be one of the idea men of this gang!  My favourite has to be this one:<br />Introduce a “more energy at lower cost with less environmental damage and greater national security bill” as a replacement for the Warner-Lieberman “tax and trade” bill…</p>
<p>This will also be known as the No Trade-Offs/Free Lunch Act of 2008.  Gingrich forgot to mention introducing the bill to protect endangered unicorns.  Gingrich supplements this with such proposals as, I kid you not, an earmark moratorium (take on those tough issues, Newt!), a gas tax holiday that will allegedly be paid for by “cutting domestic discretionary spending,” using the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to manipulate oil prices (very slightly), tackling all of the outrageous waste at the Census Bureau (?), and, naturally, banging the drum about the judiciary.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/193377.php">David Kurtz</a> catches this remark from Senator Menendez:<br />
<blockquote>Thank God that we don&#8217;t have economists making necessarily public policy</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow – Menendez must love how the Bush White House makes public policy!  But then let’s check out his <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/193519.php">clarification</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>the point I was making was that the everyday pains that average Americans are feeling aren&#8217;t always taken into account by an economist sitting behind a desk looking at numbers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m sorry but this is a really stupid statement.  We at the blog like most economists do take into account the impact of higher prices on individual households.  Maybe some conservatives think we spend too much time on distributional effects but to say we just look at the aggregate numbers is one of the dumbest things I’ve heard in a long time.</p>
<p>Update: Courtesy of AB reader Brooks, the comments by <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/05/in-praise-of-gas-tax-hysterics.html">Greg Mankiw</a> are a must read.  Greg is arguing that when <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/gas-tax-hysterics">Paul Krugman</a> says this gas tax holiday is small potatoes, the following must be also said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paul is right that the issue is, quantitatively, small potatoes, but I am nonetheless pleased to see it get so much attention. This issue is like the canary in the coal mine: No one really cares about the canary, but its condition tells us about deeper problems that lie below.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/05/oderint-dum-met.html">Brad DeLong</a> agrees with Greg:</p>
<blockquote><p>it is important that presidential candidates fear economists even in the campaign. If they don&#8217;t fear their economists, then we get campaign promises of really lousy economic policy, some of which will then make it into post-election real policy, and then we are in trouble. Republican politicians have not feared their economists since&#8230; the Eisenhower administration, I think, and so Republican economic policy is overwhelmingly lousy. Democratic politicians have in the past and still today fear the bad headlines that are generated if their own economic advisers say that they are full of it. And so their campaign rhetoric is less out-to-lunch. And their post-election policies are better. For Paul to take steps to diminish Democratic politicians&#8217; fear of economists&#8230; Well, it&#8217;s contrary to guild rules. Just saying&#8230;</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Well Reader Dan invited me to submit some posts on Social Security and so here I am. Depending on reader interest this is the first in a series trying to get us to a deeper understanding of what Social Security actually is and where it is likely heading. And that may be a much different place than most people currently think.</p>
<p>Social Security finance is a really odd beast, it has a strong up is down quality that tends to baffle people. For example I will be making the case in a later post that cutting Social Security benefits actually harms the long range financial stability of the system. Why this seeming paradox holds requires us to examine some mechanical peculiarities of a PayGo system given the details of the current state of its financing. But before diving into the deep end I want to establish a conceptual framework, that is to show you Social Security through my eyes.</p>
<p>First it all starts, and mostly stops, with the Trustees&#8217; Reports, more formally known as the &#8216;ANNUAL REPORT OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE FEDERAL OLD-AGE AND SURVIVORS INSURANCE AND FEDERAL DISABILITY INSURANCE TRUST FUNDS&#8217;. Almost every fact, factoid and date cited in this debate comes directly or indirectly from this Report. (Certainly CBO has a slightly different interpretation but they don&#8217;t really challenge the fundamental assumptions of the Trustees). For the most part in this game all of the players are playing out of the same playbook and more importantly out of a particular subset of that book. More on that point later. The first lesson people need to learn is that &#8216;It is already built into the model&#8217;. This is particularly important in relation to the demographics, because the first response from those hearing that Social Security is not particularly in crisis is: &#8216;What about the Boomer Retirement?&#8217; &#8216;More retirees, less workers, what don&#8217;t you get about that?&#8217; or &#8216;People are living longer!&#8221; Well I know all those things mainly because the demographers working in the Office of the Chief Actuary know them full well and have already accounted for them in their models. Which are published in the Report. Which I read.</p>
<p>Second point. Social Security really and truly is Insurance. Endless efforts have been made to blur this fact, and I expect/hope to see some in comments, but they all fail in the face of the actual operation of the system. Social Security collects premiums from all wage workers up to a determined wage level and disperses benefits to qualified beneficiaries. Which is pretty much the same as what New York Life does, cash flows in one door and out the other. That varying things happen with excess cash in between are not really the concern of the buyer and future beneficiary of the policy, as long as they get the promised benefits when the time comes then all&#8217;s fair. That is there is no functional distinction between drawing a benefit dollar from the existing investment pool as opposed to simply paying it out of current premiums, PayGo does not equate to Ponzi. Banks and Insurance Companies don&#8217;t have current cash reserves equivalent to all of their obligations, instead that money is locked up in what may be long term investments, instead they rely on current cash flow to carry the load. Of course banks are required to hold some cash reserves with the Federal Reserve and Insurance companies themselves carry reinsurance, you can&#8217;t get too close to the edge. And this is where Social Security Insurance departs from New York Life, instead of reinsurance it has Trust Funds.</p>
<p>Which gets us to the third point. Social Security is not the Trust Funds anymore than New York Life is its reinsurance policy. The Trust Funds are simply the numeric measure of how much Social Security has in long term reserves. This amount can over any given year or series of years trend up or down without directly effecting benefit payments. In an up year Income Excluding Interest exceeds Cost and so surpluses flow to the Trust Fund, in a down year Income Excluding Interest lags Cost and the Trust Fund has to be drawn down, but typically not by much, current income is always carrying much of the load and would even if the Trust Fund went to zero.</p>
<p>Last points for today. Trust Fund &#8216;crisis&#8217; is normally set at two possible points. One is crisis at Shortfall, that point where Current Income is projected to fall behind Cost for an extended period. This would require a sustained drawdown on the Trust Fund as more and more interest is diverted to pay current benefits. Whether this really equates to &#8216;crisis&#8217; requires an analysis of the actual dollars in context. That rarely happens, instead people jump right to &#8216;Raise taxes to unendurable levels! or Slash benefits to the bone! We got to act now!!&#8217; Well this hysteria whether real or fake (and much of it is fake) is simply that. Absent an examination of the numbers it is simply as Shakespeare put it &#8216;A tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing&#8217;, In this particular case if you can&#8217;t say it in numbers you really shouldn&#8217;t be saying it at all.</p>
<p>The second &#8216;crisis&#8217; point, and the more traditional one, is crisis at Depletion, that point where the Trust Fund has been drawn down to nothing. Once again the temptation is to jump to &#8220;Oh My God we&#8217;ll have to raise taxes&#8217; or worse &#8216;Its bankrupt!! Dead broke!!! Checks will stop!!&#8217; Well that too is mostly nonsense, by law we need do nothing at Trust Fund Depletion, instead benefits would simply be reduced to whatever level was supported by current income. Whether that adds up to &#8216;crisis&#8217; is once again a matter of comparing the numbers to the actual schedule of benefits while comparing it to benefit levels today. In the event the relevent equation from the 2008 Report is 78% of 160% = 120%. More on that later.</p>
<p>So lessons attempted here?<br />1. Numbers matter and they are to be found in the Reports. Including all the relevant demographic ones.<br />2. Social Security is in fact a Pay as you Go Insurance plan with a certain level of reserves. It is not a Ponzi scheme.<br />3. That reserve is called the Trust Fund, but is not itself the whole of Social Security any more than your bank account is the whole of your finances.<br />4. No one likes to draw down their reserves as we would at Shortfall, but you have to put that in context of your entire financial position. Which means looking at the numbers, see point 1<br />5. You plan for your retirement and ideally meet 100% or more of your goal. Hitting 78% may or may not be some sort of crisis, it might just mean buying a smaller boat. We need to examine Depletion in the context of both absolute level of benefit cuts and probability that the current projection will come to be.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be glad to answer questions and meet challenges in comments. In future posts I will be explaining some of the odd terminology used: Low Cost alternative, Trust Fund Ratio, Covered Worker Ratio etc. For those who just can&#8217;t stand to wait you might want to browse the Nov. 2004 archives of the Bruce Web (bruceweb.blogspot.com).</p>

                                <p>How to use Your IRS Rebate check&#8230;<br />As you may have heard, each of us will be getting <br />a tax rebate check to stimulate the economy.<br />If we spend that money at Wal-Mart, all the money will go to China . <br />If we spend it on gasoline it will go to the Arabs. <br />If we purchase a computer it will go to India  <br />If we purchase fruits and vegetables it will go to Honduras &#038; Guatemala.<br />If we purchase a good car it will go to Japan. <br />If we purchase useless stuff it will also go to China.<br />And none of it will help the American economy.<br />We need to keep that money here in America .<br />The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it at<br /><strong>Yard Sales </strong>, since those are the only businesses left owned by Americans !!</p>
<p>There is another version suggesting one use it to indulge their risque side.  With that, is there some truth to this suggestion?  Is the spending of the money in some place other than a small business like my flower shop, or a yard sale just making the rebate another channel for  money to move out of the government (us) and into the hands of the few leaving us to also pay the taxes&#8230;some day?</p>
<p>If anything, buying used or at a yard sale will reduce the consumption of more resources.  I mean, I love Craigslist.</p>

<blockquote><p>Moody&#8217;s has cut Fannies financial strength rating to B from B+, but affirmed its debt rating at Aaa. Rationale? Fannie is at considerable risk of needing help in avoiding default, but the help is going to come, just going to, so that the risk of actual default is too low to contemplate. </p>
<p>Moody&#8217;s is implying that moral hazard is part of Fannie&#8217;s business plan and that we (as either stock holders, tax payers, or both) are on the hook for the risk.</p></blockquote>

<p>One of the repeated objectives of the highest managers of the military industrial complex is: </p>
<p>&#8220;Reliable and cost effective industrial capabilities sufficient to meet strategic objectives&#8221;.</p>
<p>Former DoD management objectives had the &#8220;health&#8221; of the defense industry as a goal. Political appointees, summer help that they are, refer to the military industrial complex as “partners” and “team members”. This is done to confuse people and hide the waste and fraud going on with conflating profit with the &#8220;security&#8221; of the country.</p>
<p>Partners and team members should not make more money than their value to other “partners”. Unfortunately, the partnership does not extend to the soldiers, citizens or the payers of the social security surplus the DoD &#8216;partners&#8217; and &#8216;team members&#8217; use to make the profits for only a small part of the team at the expense of better uses for the money the vast majority of the citizens.</p>
<p>Faulty decision making, fear mongering and continuing waste are the hallmark of this select team that devotes itself to profiting from unnecessary continuous mobilization against some “broad spectrum” bogey men out loose in the dangerous world.</p>
<p>They never broach the question of whether there are better uses of the scarce resource.</p>
<p>They have built a trough filled with gold and the “partners’ and “team members” feed at the trough as “reliable and cost effective industrial capabilities” are mirages.</p>
<p>Their trough is the ends, not any real national security for the taxpayer.</p>
<p>Might as well whittle beaks to defend against the bogey men as rely on the “reliable and cost effective” war profiteering “team members”.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>

                                <p>Chrysler LLC has stood out among the Detroit Three in being able to sell neither its trucks nor its cars in the slumping auto market.  Cue the latest in marketing innovations!  Via <a href="http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080506/FREE/889117730/1530/FREE">AutoWeek</a>, Chrysler&#8217;s latest sales promo offers buyers three years of (currently) subvented gas (at $2.99 for regular, $3.29 for premium).  The deal&#8217;s revenue-leakage-limiting limitations make this something on the order of $1,000 on the hood at today&#8217;s gas prices.  That&#8217;s not an earthshaking amount by the standards of Domestic Three incentives, though it does go to show that if you&#8217;re not constrained by the public good, or not doing stupid things like subsidizing gas for everyone, and have some tolerance for going broke, you can do more than a few pennies a gallon.</p>
<p>Were this another blog, I might call this a Markets in More Things story, since it effectively extends to the consumer market hedging techniques that large fuel users such as airlines have deployed for years. For instance, the NYT notes this morning that Southwest managed to arrange for <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/business/06air.html">70 percent of its 2008 fuel bill at $51/barrel</a>.  (Are the counterparties on suicide watch?)  Here, Chrysler is acting as a fleet buyer for its customers, working with a startup that has a bunch of business-method patent applications pending on a system of at-the-pump fixed pricing for fleets.</p>
<p>Even the diminished Chrysler&#8217;s monthly sales would make for a pretty big fleet, so I&#8217;m curious as to how the risk is divided up here, and for that matter to what extent Chrysler is hedged.  Until the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 raised future fuel economy standards, the Domestic Three&#8217;s product planning looked like they thought high oil prices were a fad, so who knows.  I probably wouldn&#8217;t want to bet against Cerberus&#8217;s recent anti-Midas touch, though.</p>

                                <p>What is it like to sit on a land mine? That is precisely the feeling that I have had of late. For the past half-year, we have been walking through land mines.</p>
<p>Two recent events combined to make an ominous click:
<ol>
<li>The Fed is now <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/fed-expands-auction-accepts-wider/story.aspx?guid=%7BBD25FFE1-EF18-45C1-B984-3CD33807727B%7D">accepting wider</a> collateral: Bonds backed by auto loans and credit cards (cf Rdan&#8217;s piece below)</li>
<li>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/business/06fannie.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">playing hardball</a> with regulators<br />
<blockquote>The companies, which were created by Congress but are owned by investors, suffered more than $9 billion in mortgage-related losses last year, and analysts expect those losses to grow this year. Fannie Mae is to release its latest financial results on Tuesday and Freddie Mac is to report earnings next week.<br />The companies are sitting on as much as $19 billion in additional losses that they have not yet fully acknowledged, analysts say. If either company stumbled, the mortgage business could lose its only lubricant, potentially causing the housing market to plummet and the credit markets to freeze up completely.<br />And if Fannie or Freddie fail, taxpayers would probably have to bail them out at a staggering cost.</p></blockquote>
<p></li>
</ol>
<p>The problem with the last is that Fannie&#8217;s and Freddie&#8217;s financial &#8220;cushion may be too thin.&#8221; Additionally, the interests of those running them may not coincide with national interests:<br />
<blockquote>Moreover, the companies are using their newfound clout to push Congress and their regulator to roll back the limits that were imposed after recent scandals over accounting and executive pay, according to participants in those conversations.<br />&#8230;<br />Because of the widespread perception that the government would intervene if either company failed, they can borrow money at lower interest rates than their competitors. As a result, they have earned enormous profits that have enriched shareholders and managers alike: from 1990 to 2000, each company’s stock grew more than 500 percent and top executives were paid tens of millions of dollars.<br />&#8230;<br />In a March meeting, Freddie Mac’s chairman, Richard F. Syron, bolstered those fears by saying the company would put shareholders’ interests first. </p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe it is just me, but I am having a harder and harder time reading the news. I just don&#8217;t want to look&#8230;or hear an ominous click, click. Wake me when it is over, please.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m with <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/TheBigPicture/~3/283364160/visualizing-inf.html">Barry Ritholtz</a> in admiring the NYT&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2008/05/03/business/20080403_SPENDING_GRAPHIC.html">interactive consumer price inflation mosaic</a>, which the print edition didn&#8217;t do justice to.    As someone who occasionally gets a bee in the bonnet over the successes and failures of economic measurement methods, the graphic also helps illustrate a couple ways in which CPI can be <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/03/actual-economics-post-why-shadow.html">unfairly maligned</a>.  As I read it, the graphic deals best with one class of arguments for why CPI is screwed up:</p>
<p>ZOMG the price of [CPI component in the news] is skyrocketing!   Lo, prices of goods that headlines would lead you to believe should be measured as skyrocketing by-and-large are — +26% for gasoline, +48% for heating oil, etc.  Gasoline is even a big enough component of average expenditures for the price increases to be legitimately painful for anyone without good substitution opportunities.  But it&#8217;s still only so much of a representative budget; cheese, bread, and eggs are much less so.   And ample sums are spent on other things where there isn&#8217;t much or even any inflation at all.  (How these all should be treated for any given policy purpose is a separate issue.)  Meanwhile, the gorilla in the room is housing, as housing rentals and equivalents account for 30% of expenditures.</p>
<p>However, that leads to a second bad argument:</p>
<p>ZOMG the biggest component of CPI is imputed!  Indeed, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/mike-mandel-rem.html">Brad DeLong</a> recently observed Michael Mandel suggesting that personal consumption expenditures be calculated ex-imputations — of which owner-occupied housing is the biggest.  That wasn&#8217;t the sharpest thing that&#8217;ll appear in BusinessWeek this year.  Catch is, it&#8217;s not like homeowners don&#8217;t (a) consume housing services and (b) incur opportunity costs doing so whether or not they (like my family among other leveraged real estate investment partnerships) actually shell out a lot of cash for house payments.  We consume non-marketed goods and services all the time.  Missing markets in almost everything, I like to say.</p>
<p>The details of the imputation of housing expenditures for owners certainly aren&#8217;t sacred.  For one thing, in much of the country, the rental and owner-occupied housing stocks resemble each other very little.  For another, I&#8217;d like to hear why it would be unreasonable to calculate the imputed rent at a &#8216;rational&#8217; rate given what the owners paid, which goes to the issue of whether housing expenditures above imputed market rents should be treated as consumption or investment.    Anyway, between <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CalculatedRisk/~3/280371885/homeownership-and-vacancy-rates.html">vacancies</a> and the supply of foreclosed properties, I doubt shelter inflation will be a big problem in the near future.</p>
<p>So, I don&#8217;t go to bed worrying about inflation, or that we&#8217;ve been in an especially protracted recession for years and apparently don&#8217;t know it (an implication of claims you can find out there that CPI and like measures understate &#8220;true&#8221; inflation by very large amounts).  Employment and the distribution of such growth as we have had is another matter.</p>

Probably worth several posts. Hat tip to stormy.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Reserve, along with other central banks, said Friday that it was increasing the funding it is providing to banks and announced that, for the first time, it was willing to accept bonds backed by auto loans and credit cards.<br />&#8220;In view of the persistent liquidity pressures in some term funding markets, the European Central Bank, the Federal Reserve and the Swiss National Bank are announcing an expansion of their liquidity measures,&#8221; the Fed said in a statement. </p>
<p>The Fed took the move in an attempt to flood the market with supply and lower short-term lending rates, such as the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. <br />The U.S. central bank announced an increase, to $75 billion from $50 billion, in the amounts auctioned to eligible depository institutions under its biweekly Term Auction Facility, beginning with the auction on May 5.</p>
<p>This increase will bring the amounts outstanding under the TAF to $150 billion. <br />The move to expand the TAF was widely anticipated because of strong demand for loans through the program. See full story. </p>
<p>&#8220;The program is now reaching a magnitude where it can play a significant role in plugging the gap between the remaining demand for unsecured term funding in the bank market and the latest decline in supply following the run on Bear Stearns,&#8221; wrote Lou Crandall, chief economist for Wrightson ICAP. <br />The expansion was &#8220;probably marginally disappointing because there was a widespread expectation &#8230; that the Fed would extend the term of at least some TAF auctions to three months,&#8221; wrote Stephen Stanley, chief economist for RBS Greenwich Capital. </p>
<p>The TAF, announced on Dec. 12, was followed in March by the creation of several other Fed lending programs targeted at different sectors of the credit markets. <br />All told, the Fed has now offered to lend up to $462 billion in cash and Treasurys to the markets, in addition to the nearly unlimited funds available through the discount window and the primary credit dealer facility. <br />The three-month Libor rate &#8212; a benchmark for lending between banks &#8212; was 2.78% on Thursday, well above the 2% federal funds rate. Crandall said extra supply from the Fed in the next three weeks should tighten the spread between the Libor and fed funds rates. </p>
<p>Deeper cooperation</p>
<p>The Federal Open Market Committee also has authorized further increases in its existing temporary currency-swap arrangements with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank. <br />These arrangements will now provide dollars in amounts of up to $50 billion and $12 billion to the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank, respectively, representing increases of $20 billion and $6 billion. <br />The FOMC also authorized an expansion of the collateral that can be pledged by bond dealers in the Fed&#8217;s Schedule 2 Term Securities Lending Facility auctions of Treasurys. </p>
<p>Primary dealers may now pledge AAA/Aaa-rated asset-backed securities, in addition to already eligible residential- and commercial-mortgage-backed securities and agency collateralized mortgage obligations. <br />Accepting asset-backed paper could help provide money to the student-loan market, Crandall noted.</p></blockquote>
