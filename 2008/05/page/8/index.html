<p>IT’S NOT EASY TO SIZE UP THE influence of the index funds. But based on their known cash commitments in certain commodities, and the commodity indexes their prospectuses say they track, it is possible to estimate the size of their commitments in all commodities they buy. Using this method, analyst Briese&#8230;estimates that the index funds hold about $211 billion worth of bets on the buy side in U.S. markets.</p>
<p>Applying a similar method, but with slightly different assumptions for indexes tracked, Bianco Research analyst Greg Blaha puts that figure at $194 billion. Either figure is enough to turn the index funds into the behemoths of the commodity pits, where total bullish positions now stand at $568 billion.<br />[&#8230;]<br />That this large, bullishly oriented group of funds is flourishing is partly a result of a regulatory anomaly. In recognition of the fact that the commodity markets are too small to absorb an excess of speculative dollars, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, in conjunction with exchanges, imposes position limits on speculators. But the agency has effectively exempted the index funds from position limits.<br />[&#8230;]<br />The speculators, now so bullish, are mainly the index funds. To see how their influence on the market has become outsized, just look at how they operate. Nearly $9 out of every $10 of index-fund money is not traded directly on the commodity exchanges, but instead goes through dealers that belong to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA). These swaps dealers lay off their speculative risk on the organized commodity markets, while effectively serving as market makers for the index funds. By using the ISDA as a conduit, the index funds get an exemption from position limits that are normally imposed on any other speculator, including the $1 in every $10 of index-fund money that does not go through the swaps dealers.</p>
<p>The purpose of position limits on speculators, which date back to 1936, is clearly stated in the rules: It’s to protect these relatively small markets from price distortions. An exemption is offered only to &#8220;bona fide hedgers&#8221; (not to be confused with &#8220;hedge funds&#8221;), who take offsetting positions in the physical commodity.</p>
<p>The basic argument put forward by the CFTC for exempting swaps dealers is that they, too, are offsetting other positions — those taken with the <a href="http://commitmentsoftraders.org/...g/?p=32#more-%2032">index funds</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s really no question unless one rigidly adheres to a type of efficient market thesis.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>On a conference call with conservative bloggers this afternoon, John McCain launched what may be his most direct attack yet on Barack Obama&#8217;s national security credentials, saying flat out that Obama is incapable of protecting America and lacks the necessary traits to keep it secure from foreign threats.  In a reference to Obama&#8217;s declared willingness to meet with the leader of Iran, McCain said:  &#8220;I think [it] is an unacceptable position, and shows that Senator Obama does not have the knowledge, the experience, the background to make the kind of judgments that are necessary to preserve this nation&#8217;s security.&#8221;  That seems like an unequivocal declaration that Obama is incapable of protecting this country. In the past, McCain has raised doubts about Obama&#8217;s national security cred, but to our knowledge has never taken the step of declaring outright that he&#8217;s unfit to defend the country.  McCain&#8217;s comments also go considerably farther than McCain did in his comments this morning about Bush&#8217;s Israel speech attacking Dems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Make the kind of judgments?  Let’s review that “judgment” made on March 19, 2003  &#8211; the day we invaded Iraq.  Now who was smart enough to say this was a mistake even before March 19, 2003 and who is stupid enough to think this decision was a good one?</p>

                                <p>In response to some vigorous discussion in the comments last week, the other Bears and I decided to host a blog seminar in &#8216;Savings 101,&#8217; and I was duly nominated (i.e. drafted) to get the ball rolling. This installment will primarily cover the definition of personal savings and major features of how it&#8217;s measured for the purposes of the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA).  I liberally and without other citation draw on a number of methodology papers posted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, <a href="http://www.bea.gov/methodologies/index.htm#national_meth">get them here</a>.  A second installment will discuss rationales for savings and financial &#8220;innovations&#8221; that may affect savings behavior. As demand warrants, later installments may discuss savings of firms and governments.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll get the ball rolling after the jump.</p>
<p>1. Defining Personal Savings</p>
<p>A simple definition of personal savings, which also happens to be the NIPA definition, is whatever&#8217;s left over from personal income after taxes and consumption:</p>
<p>Savings = Personal Income &#8211; Personal Taxes &#8211; Personal Consumption Expenditures [PCE]</p>
<p>From the NIPA accounting perspective, this definition relates sources of personal income with uses of the income; &#8220;savings&#8221; is the term makes the accounts balance.  At least in the short run, PCE may be greater than income after taxes and savings will be negative.  To make a little more sense out of it than the accountant&#8217;s desire to balance ledgers, net savings may also (and relatedly) be considered as a flow of funds to or from stores of wealth.  Indeed, the BEA handily provides a comparison of NIPA and flow-of-funds savings measures, and they track each other pretty well.  (The latter series is a lot noisier.)</p>
<p>In addition to personal savings, NIPA also counts savings by businesses in the form of retained earnings and by government in the form of unspent tax dollars.  In 2006, essentially all of the net savings recorded in NIPA, around $250 billion, came from businesses&#8217; retained earnings of some $400 billion.  That year, personal savings were $39 billion, and the government sector dissaved to the tune of nearly $196 billion thanks mostly to the federal government&#8217;s unified budget deficit.  (State and local governments, which commonly operate under balanced-budget constraints and also may maintain small rainy-day funds, were net savers.)  You may compare these to 2006 GDP of $13,195 billion, personal income of $10,983 billion, business income of $5,814 billion, and government revenues of $3,935 billion as you&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>2. The NIPA Measurement of Personal Savings</p>
<p>The basic relationship defining personal savings above may be simple enough on its face, but it does beg the questions of just what constitutes personal income (PI) and what is included in PCE (and how it&#8217;s measured).</p>
<p>PI is a bit more straightforward than PCE.  By far the biggest component of PI is wages, salaries, and benefits.  Next is dividend and interest income.  Then comes transfers, mostly from government benefits programs.  Then comes income from business proprietorship, and finally a small amount of rental income.</p>
<p>Contributions to government social insurance programs (read, Social Security and Medicare) are subtracted from PI and added to government receipts.  So accumulation of social insurance trust funds is considered savings in the NIPAs, though government rather than personal savings.  Of course, as seen above the Social Security program&#8217;s savings currently serve to offset  in part dissavings elsewhere in the government sector, i.e. the &#8220;on-budget&#8221; federal deficit.</p>
<p>The other big question is, what is included in PCE?   PCE tries to measure personal consumption quite broadly, covering consumption of durable goods (which have an expected useful life of three years or longer), non-durable goods, and services.  Non-durable goods and market services are straightforward, at least in theory, in that those basically involve current expenditures for current consumption.  For housing and other durables, the NIPAs offer something to make everyone a little mad, since those measurements involve a variety of assumptions and imputations that aren&#8217;t necessarily innocent.</p>
<p>The big imputation relates to owner-occupied housing, a/k/a &#8220;owner&#8217;s equivalent rent.&#8221;  The idea here is that houses and other residential structures are forms of fixed capital and the consumption is of shelter services produced using that capital.  Renters pay for those services in market transactions, but owners — while they consume similar shelter services to renters of comparable dwellings — don&#8217;t literally charge themselves rent.  However, the rent that could hypothetically be obtained by renting out a house instead of occupying it is an opportunity cost of owner-occupation.  That opportunity cost amounts to owners&#8217; implicit expenditures on shelter services.  Importantly, there&#8217;s no reason to view owners&#8217; mortgage payment(s), or lack thereof, as having any particular relationship to that implicit shelter expenditure.</p>
<p>The rent imputation helps make the measurement of housing services less invariant to how people obtain them.  Think of two identical houses next door to each other, one of which rents for $10,000/year and the other of which is occupied by an owner who owns the house outright.  In the absence of the imputation, PCE would measure only the $10,000 in market rent.  If instead the owner rented the house next door, and rented out her or his house for the same $10,000, measured PCE would increase to $20,000 even though all we&#8217;ve done is move families between two identical houses.</p>
<p>Finally, and importantly for savings measurement, the imputation of rent effectively splits housing outlays into savings and consumption components.  To the extent actual outlays exceed the imputed rent, the excess is treated as saving. </p>
<p>Economists of a reasonably orthodox bent shouldn&#8217;t take issue with owner&#8217;s equivalent rent at a conceptual level, but the actual measurement involves a fair amount of sausage-making.  In particular, the owners&#8217; rent is extrapolated from market rents.  While the rental-extrapolation method is based on the presumed existence of &#8220;well-developed&#8221; housing rental markets, in many cases those markets are quite thin in units comparable to the owner-occupied housing stock. </p>
<p>If you think the PCE methods are too economically pure for housing services, the BEA&#8217;s methods are more expedient than correct for other consumer durables (e.g. autos).   PCE simply includes the full selling prices of durables at the time of durable-goods sales.  This would tend to make durable-goods PCE more volatile than actual durables consumption.  This may also make NIPA savings appear relatively low during durables booms and high during durables busts.</p>
<p>A final large category of imputed consumption is for financial services provided without explicit charges.  These services aren&#8217;t free, of course; the associated expenses are usually subtracted off investment income before it&#8217;s paid by the financial services providers.  In this case, the NIPA methodology imputes both the value of the services and an addition to personal income for the subtraction, so it&#8217;s on both sides of the savings equation and doesn&#8217;t affect the measured level of personal savings.   </p>
<p>A lot of criticism of the standard definition of personal savings boils down to potential differences between aggregate personal savings and an equation that shows the direction of personal assets:</p>
<p>Change in Assets = Net Cash Flow + Investment Earnings + (Unrealized) Gains or Losses from Asset Price Changes</p>
<p>The NIPA methodology explicitly declines to include the last term in income, regarding it as &#8220;reflect[ing] a change in wealth rather than a change in productive activity.&#8221;  However, changes in and levels of wealth are widely regarded as interacting with expenditures and savings behavior, so it&#8217;s hardly irrelevant.  We will turn to that in Savings 101b.</p>

<blockquote><p>Retail spending dropped very little last month, and it didn’t drop at all if you exclude autos. Meanwhile, consumer spending has consistently been up compared to the same time last year. The consumer will simply stop spending? Hasn’t happened.</p></blockquote>
<p>Translation – if consumption of nondurable goods goes up, real GDP cannot fall.  Never mind that consumption of durable goods fell last quarter.  Never mind that both residential and non-residential investment fell last quarter.  Never mind that some of what we consume is imported and that imports rose last quarter:</p>
<blockquote><p>Oh, and gas prices will never, ever, ever reduce retail spending since gas is a component of retail spending. Chain stores own gas stations. More money spent on gas is not a subtraction from overall consumer spending, it’s a transfer from one retail department to another.</p></blockquote>
<p>What a dumb statement!  Gasoline price increases are attributable to higher prices for oil and not higher retail margins.  And of course, Bowyer knows more about housing valuations than anyone:</p>
<blockquote><p>Basing big-picture assumptions on Case-Shiller is a faulty approach, too.</p></blockquote>
<p>I know the National Review prides itself on being about as ill informed on economics as it gets but isn’t Bowyer a total embarrassment even from them?</p>

Overall<br />manufacturing output fell 0.8%, but excluding auto and auto parts manufacturing output fell<br />0.4%.  Because the auto output is being distorted, and will generate a snapback of output when the strike ends, manufacturing output will not be giving clear signals for months.</p>
<p>To get around this I looked at manufacturing output excluding autos and auto parts.  The compound, smoothed  three month growth rate for this series is -2.0%. The three month growth rate of this series is a good, but not perfect recession indicator.  But if the US is not going into a recession this was be the largest false signal this series has generated.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.swamppolitics.com/news/politics/blog/2008/05/pelosi_challenges_mccain_sort.html">Matthew Hay Brown</a> gives me yet another reason to praise the Speaker of the House:</p>
<blockquote><p>The oblique references continue. Some believe President Bush was alluding to Barack Obama this morning when he criticized &#8220;some people&#8221; who &#8220;seem to believe we should negotiate with terrorists and radicals.&#8221; Now House Speaker Nancy Pelosi appears to be calling on John McCain to distance himself from the remarks Bush made before the Israeli Knesset. &#8220;You know, we have a protocol, sort of, a custom, informally, around here that we don&#8217;t criticize the president when he is on foreign soil,&#8221; Pelosi told reporters this morning. &#8220;One would think that that would apply to the president, that he would not criticize Americans when he is on foreign soil. &#8220;I think what the president did in that regard is beneath the dignity of the office of president and unworthy of our representation at that observance in Israel, and I would hope that any serious person would disassociate himself from the president&#8217;s remarks, who aspires to leaderhip in our country.&#8221; Asked if she was referring to McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, the California Democrat repeated: &#8220;Any serious person. Any serious person.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But I guess McCain isn’t <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/05/mccain-obama-na.html">listening</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Saying he takes Bush at his word that he wasn&#8217;t speaking directly of Obama, McCain said, &#8220;It does bring up an issue I will be discussing with the American people, and that is why does Barack Obama, Senator Obama want to sit down with a state sponsor of terrorism?&#8221; McCain said in the back of his campaign bus. &#8220;What does he want to talk about with, with [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad who said that Israel’s a stinking corpse, who said that he wants to wipe Israel off the map, who’s sending the most explosive devices into Iraq, killing Americans?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The point is that peace through strength is the way we achieve peace in the world. That’s the point. I will debate this issue with Senator Obama throughout this campaign.&#8221; Going farther, McCain continued to connect Obama with Ahmadinejad and highlight the Iranian leader&#8217;s incendiary comments about Israel. &#8220;I think Barack Obama needs to explain why he wants to sit down and talk with a man who is the head of a government that is a state sponsor of terror that is responsible for the killing of brave young Americans and wants to wipe Israel off the map and denies the Holocaust,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;It is a serious error on the part of Senator Obama that shows naiveté and inexperience and lack of judgment to say that he wants to sit down across the table from an individual who leads a country that says and says that Israel is a stinking corpse, that is dedicated to the extinction of the state of Israel.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Peace through strength?  This is the slogan of the Likud Party and their policies have turned a bad situation for Israel into a worse one.  If McCain thinks we have peace between Israel and Palestine, he’s an idiot.  Of course, anyone who thinks our version of this – invading Iraq on March 19, 2003 – has worked well is also an idiot.  The Speaker may have given great advice but the person that it was apparently directed at appears to be as pathetic and clueless as President Bush.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The following is a reworked version of a piece originally put up immediately after the release of the 2006 Report in response to what seemed a very worrisome development. After a long series of years of continual improvement in Social Security long term outlook, suddenly progress stalled and actually reversed, the payroll gap went from 1.89% in 2004 to 1.92% in 2005 to 2.02% in 2006. Cause for concern? Absolutely. Cause for action? Well lets do the numbers.</p>
<p>Can we quantify the price of inaction on Social Security? My starting point is this table from EPI <a href="http://www.epi.org/content.cfm/issueguides_socialsecurity_changes">Changes in Trustees Projections Over Time</a>.<br />Note these are not EPI numbers, these are official numbers from the Annual Reports: &#8220;Source: Annual Reports of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Disability Insurance Trust Funds, 1996-2004.&#8221; With the help of reader Paul in comments I can now present a series that is filled in and longer.<br />Report Date:::Payroll Gap:::Trust Fund Depletion<br />1996:::2.19%:::2029<br />1997:::2.23%:::2029<br />1998:::2.19%:::2032<br />1999:::2.07%:::2034<br />2000:::1.89%:::2037</p>
<p>My fundamental views about Social Security crystalized in the 1999-2000 period. Anyone looking at this number series and drawing the conclusion &#8216;Man we got to start moving on this crisis, and soon&#8217; is simply innumeric. Maybe something would need to be done down the road but as it stood Trust Fund depletion was retreating at a rate of two years per year, suggesting it might never come. Now the Bush years and a more complicated story.</p>
<p>2001:::1.86%:::2038 (Reader Paul supplied these, and the series after 2004-thanks Paul)<br />2002:::1.87%:::2041<br />2003:::1.92%:::2042<br />2004:::1.89%:::2042</p>
<p>This is where President Bush entered the battle. Clearly progress was being made, Depletion was still being pushed out in date and this even true in 2004 when taken by month, I think there was about a nine month improvement over the course of the year. This progress didn&#8217;t show up as much on the payroll gap side, but properly understood this is all the more cause for Inactivity. Doing Nothing in Bush&#8217;s first term was the effective equivalent of a tax cut averaging 1.89% in each year, and all from the first dollar and not the last, for wage workers the Cost of Inactivity was money left in their pockets. Absent a better deal than what they were being offered they really had no reason to move. As it turns out Bush&#8217;s implied preference, the Posen Plan did not in fact offer that deal, a point that was hammered home by Lee A. Arnold in a clever animation <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tts2uTWt6e8">Econolanguage: Social Security</a> now available on YouTube.</p>
<p>2005:::1.92%:::2041<br />2006:::2.02%:::2040 (this is what percipitated the early version of this post, that was not pleasant news)<br />2007:::1.95%:::2041<br />2008:::1.70%:::2041</p>
<p>Now let the fun begin. My oh my plenty of numeric fun to be added. Below the fold.</p>
<p>Lets take this as if it were a betting game, me betting my current dollar against some lost dollars going forward. Now clearly in any year that shows an absolute improvement in either magnitude of the gap and/or Depletion moving out in time is a winning bet for Nothing. As are a series of years with that same result. For example we could take it by term:<br />1996:::2.19%<br />2000:::1.89%<br />2004:::1.89%<br />2008:::1.7%<br />Winner, winner, chicken dinner!! Each term left four years of taxes not taken in peoples wallets and ended up with a cost per year going forward that was equal or less that the starting point of the term. The people who insist that &#8216;There is no time to wait&#8217; &#8216;Sooner is better than latter&#8217; and &#8216;If we delay, if will only cost more in the end&#8217; in fact have no numeric evidence to back any of that up. Now certainly it is possible for this trend to reverse, in fact the outlook got considerably bleaker in the mid-ninties, things looked a lot better in 1993 then they did subsequently in 1997, which in the event showed &#8216;crisis&#8217; at its peak. But that is just where the game gets interesting.</p>
<p>Lets say the 2009 Report shows a jump back to 1.95%. Does this make Nothing a losing bet, should we act this year after all? Not necessarily, you have to calculate the Cost of Inactivity for each individual. And moreover decide over what period you want to measure that. Moreover the effects are not necessarily reciprocal, at least over the short run. If the payroll gap actually goes up due to worse than projected current year results, that simply suggests the previous &#8216;fix&#8217; would not in fact have fixed the entire gap, whereas when the gap moves down that current year dollar is real as real. But for the sake of argument lets say you could show that the entire uptick was due to failure to collect that one current year payroll dollar. How many years would it take to have that become a financial negative for any given individual. Well if you look at a situation where you have a level real wage when measured in constant dollars the calculation is pretty simple:</p>
<p>Amount of increase multiplied by years to retirement minus previous year payroll gap. For me in 2005 that worked out to:<br />.03 x 17 = .51 &#8211; 1.89% = -1.38%. That is over my working life Nothing in 2005 still worked out as a tax cut, just a little less than I might have hoped for. How about 2006?:<br />.10 x 16 =1.6% &#8211; 1.92% = -.32% Well kind of nets out as a skinny tax cut but one that works to one degree or another for everyone within 20 years of retirement. And of course the improvement from 2.02% to 1.95% meant Nothing was an absolute win short term and equally medium term. Take any year you like and multiply its payroll gap against the number of years between then and now. That is your cummulative tax cut equivalent for that span. Then use a variation of the equation to calculate how long it would have to be before that became a losing bet. The figure rapidly hits the hundreds of years.</p>
<p>Lets turn the bet on its head and look forward. What level of increase in payroll gap would actually make Nothing a losing bet? The calculation is a little more simple: Current year payroll gap divided by years to retirement or in my case 1.7% divided by 15 or .11%. Could the gap increase by that much? Well maybe, the jump in 2006 was close to that but even then I break even. Now if I was 22 and starting my first job I might take a little different attitude. I didn&#8217;t see any benefit from the dollars not taxed. On the other hand if I was 28 and still struggling to pay off my student loans that roughly 2% a year not taken out of my paycheck probably looks pretty good.</p>
<p>From my perspective any year where the payroll gap is less than the 2.23% of 1997 is a call for Nothing as a plan. Certainly we want to take a hard look if the numbers start trending upwards year over year, but as long as the number is fluctuating around the 2% level there is really nothing to worry about. Once you calculate the Cost of Inactivity against the current utility of that payroll dollar. After all doing nothing in 2008 will leave the median household with about $1000 or close to the amount of the current stimulus check. &#8216;Fixing&#8217; Social Security would then be the fiscal equivalent of taking away the punchbowl right as the party was scheduled to start. Nothing smart about that.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The report in yahoo news presents an odd twist in relation to government regulation and testing.  For me it brings to focus the less than idealogical intent of our current administration.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080509/ap_on_go_ca_st_pe/mad_cow">The Bush administration</a> on Friday urged a federal appeals court to stop meatpackers from testing all their animals for mad cow disease, but a skeptical judge questioned whether the government has that authority. </p>
<p>The government seeks to reverse a lower court ruling that allowed Kansas-based Creekstone Farms Premium Beef to conduct more comprehensive testing to satisfy demand from overseas customers in Japan and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Less than 1 percent of slaughtered cows are currently tested for the disease under Agriculture Department guidelines. The agency argues that more widespread testing does not guarantee food safety and could result in a false positive that scares consumers.</p>
<p>&#8220;They want to create false assurances,&#8221; Justice Department attorney Eric Flesig-Greene told a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.</p>
<p>But Creekstone attorney Russell Frye contended the Agriculture Department&#8217;s regulations covering the treatment of domestic animals contain no prohibition against an individual company testing for mad cow disease, since the test is conducted only after a cow is slaughtered. He said the agency has no authority to prevent companies from using the test to reassure customers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the government telling the consumers, `You&#8217;re not entitled to this information,'&#8221; Frye said.</p>
<p>Chief Judge David B. Sentelle seemed to agree with Creekstone&#8217;s contention that the additional testing would not interfere with agency regulations governing the treatment of animals.</p>
<p>&#8220;All they want to do is create information,&#8221; Sentelle said, noting that it&#8217;s up to consumers to decide how to interpret the information.</p>
<p>Larger meatpackers have opposed Creekstone&#8217;s push to allow wider testing out of fear that consumer pressure would force them to begin testing all animals too. Increased testing would raise the price of meat by a few cents per pound.</p>
<p>Mad cow disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy, can be fatal to humans who eat tainted beef. Three cases of mad cow disease have been discovered in the U.S. since 2003.</p>
<p>The district court&#8217;s ruling last year in favor of Creekstone was supposed to take effect June 1, 2007, but the Agriculture Department&#8217;s appeal has delayed the testing so far.</p></blockquote>
<p>The title is a bit much, but was irresistible.</p>

                                <p>History:  How the US Grew the Military Industrial Complex.</p>
<p>The size of the US national security (war) machine is not related to threats to the nation nor any reasonable or efficient response to those wildly inflated threats.  Threats are overstated and the solution to the fake insecurity is always the most expensive and profitable, neither effective nor efficient.  Those are engineering specification terms never used to describe warfare state value.</p>
<p>Good to whittle beaks for profits and keeping the trough filled.</p>
<p>The US DoD outsourced weapons making after WW II.  During WW II for profit industries: Chryser, General Motors, Kaiser Aluminum, et al, mobilized for the war effort made military weapons work and mass produced very good quality.  Some may conclude that the mobilized private sector took defense firms&#8217; and arsenals&#8217; products to greater heights of quality and efficiency.</p>
<p>After the war the congress, National Security Act of 1947, decided to use private companies for arming a vaguely defined continuous mobilization.  A largely unneeded and overly profitable arms establishment grew from the politics and greed.</p>
<p>Instead of being like the commercial companies which produced the weapons that won World War II, these nationall security industries quickly became for profit arsenals not as good as pre war public arsenals but more expensive with profits and enough money to buy congress.  In 1961 Eisenhower called it the military industrial complex.</p>
<p>The motive for perpetual mobilization and long war is profit.  In the 1940&#8217;s the Air Force became the first and subsequently main customer of RandD Inc.  We know it as RAND.  This think tank is responsible for such concepts as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) and other plans to wage nuclear armageddon.  Some think their analyses created the bloated military industrial complex.  They advocated arming ourselves to the teeth while the Soviets were collapsing economically.</p>
<p>Other think tanks arose in RAND&#8217;s image all funded by military industrial complex war profits and all selling the freightfully insecure alternatives of not buying all the unneeded super weapons.</p>
<p>Why does the US have for profit arsenals which are not effective?  Short answer is the stuff is as related to security as wooden beaks strapped to the general&#8217;s faces.</p>
<p>The think tanks sold the most expensive, unneeded solution and no one asked if any of it is &#8220;worth the taxpayers&#8217; dough&#8221; because there was a lot of money to be made.  The useless war machine took funding from better uses that the poor and meek needed.</p>
<p>Then the &#8220;supporters&#8221; equate  patriotism with militarism, masked by propaganda and war profits funded media blitzes.</p>
<p>Think tanks falsely defining the &#8220;strategy and structure&#8221; of the warfare state estabishment is one way to keep the trough filled with gold.  Building on the services&#8217; &#8220;strategic investment objectives&#8221; is another.</p>
<p>None of it is worth the taxpayers&#8217; scarce money.  But it is good for the military industrial complex, the trough.</p>
<p>Next week I will discuss how the think tanks sell &#8220;continuous mobilization&#8221; to keep them all whittlin beaks.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />Another piece by ilsm</p>
