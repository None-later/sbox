                                <p>The <a href="http://www4.fdic.gov/qbp/2008mar/qbp.pdf">most recent Quarterly Banking Profile</a> details the continued woes facing America&#8217;s banking institution. CalculatedRisk <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/05/fdic-banks-hit-by-troubled-real-estate.html">has highlighted</a> the deterioration of the &#8220;coverage ratio&#8221;, which is &#8220;loss reserves as a percentage of nonperforming loans&#8221; is now at it&#8217;s lowest level since 1993.</p>
<p>I wanted to highlight this figure from page 7, which I found particularly striking:<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SD762DmHPBI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/9mfIUpE-O08/s1600-h/qbp-loans.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SD762DmHPBI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/9mfIUpE-O08/s400/qbp-loans.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />From the report on noncurrent loans:<br />
<blockquote>Noncurrent Loan Growth Remains High<br />Even with the heightened level of charge-offs, the amount of loans and leases that were noncurrent (90 days or more past due or in nonaccrual status) rose by $26.0 billion (23.6 percent) in the first quarter, following a $27.0-billion increase in the fourth quarter of 2007. Loans secured by real estate accounted for close to 90 percent of the total increase, but almost all major loan categories registered higher noncurrent levels. The amount of real estate construction and development loans that were noncurrent increased by $9.5 billion (47.2 percent) during the quarter, while noncurrent loans secured by 1-4 family residential properties other than home equity lines of credit increased by $9.3 billion (20.2 percent). Noncurrent real estate loans secured by nonfarm nonresidential properties increased by $2.2 billion (28.5 percent), and noncurrent home equity lines of credit rose by $1.5 billion (29.5 percent). Noncurrent C&#038;I loans increased by $2.4 billion (24.9 percent). During the quarter, the percentage of total loans and leases that were noncurrent rose from 1.39 percent to 1.71 percent, the highest noncurrent rate for the industry since the first quarter of 1994. At institutions with assets greater than $1 billion, the average noncurrent rate at the end of the quarter was 1.74 percent. At smaller institutions, the average rate was 1.52 percent. More than half of all insured institutions &#8212; 52.2 percent &#8212; saw their noncurrent rates rise during the first quarter. Restructured loans and leases (which are current under modified terms) increased by $4.0 billion (57.6 percent) during the quarter, but almost half of the increase was caused by banks including restructured 1-4 family residential real estate loans for the first time. These restructured loans added $1.8 billion to the total amount of restructured loans at the end of the first quarter. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>As CalculatedRisk has been saying for some time, the wave of bank failures is coming. The FDIC isn&#8217;t on a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120398607404892133.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news&#038;apl=y&#038;r=887335">hiring spree</a> just to beef up their softball team with professional MLB ringers a la <a href="http://www.snpp.com/episodes/8F13.html">Mr Burns from the Simpson&#8217;s</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/6774491845409045519/#700512">Commenter </a><a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/6774491845409045519/#700512">              Michael McKinlay</a> points to <a href="http://www.istockanalyst.com/article/viewarticle+articleid_1930576~zoneid_Home.html">this figure</a> at istockanalyst.com. The figure was put out by Credit Suisse last summer I believe. I&#8217;ve heard it referred to several times as the &#8220;Reset Tsunami&#8221;. And               Michael McKinlay is right; there is a lot more ugly to come, and a lot of it has to do with the mortgage mess.</p>
<p>Also, I believe this reset schedule has been revised since Credit Suisse put this one together. If anyone knows where there is a more recent schedule, I&#8217;ll update the post with a link.</p>

Just a data point on which we may need to work later, and a report that will be of interest to many who read here.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: As <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/2267437700143372143/#700541">rdan notes in comments</a>, this &#8220;links to testing for mad [cow disease, or BSE] as well.&#8221;  And since I&#8217;m a week or so behind in my blog-reading, I&#8217;ll just refer everyone to this <a href="http://usfoodpolicy.blogspot.com/2008/05/banning-downer-cattle-allowing-tests.html">U.S. Food Policy post</a>, which used economic reasoning to come to a depressing but clear conclusion.***</p>
<p>One of the ways in which externalities are created is with differing regulations on what should be the same product.  The quality of the Grade-A beef you buy that was raised in Texas should be the same as the Grade-A beef that was raised in Mexico and imported.  If the inspection processes are not the same, though, the chance of contamination is raised.</p>
<p><em>I hasten to note that the probability of contamination in both cases is rather low, if you assume that the firm is an ongoing concern that plans to do business with you again.</em>*</p>
<p>But what is the effect of contaminated meat slipping through?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m glad you asked, and so is the USDA.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ers.usda.gov/Publications/ERR57/#2008-5-28"><br />Economic Impacts of Foreign Animal Disease</a> seeks to address the question. Though it deals specifically with foot-and-mouth disease, the report:<br />
<blockquote>presents a quarterly livestock and crop modeling framework in which epidemiological model results are integrated with an economic model of the U.S. agricultural sector to estimate the economic impacts of outbreaks of foreign-source livestock diseases. The framework can be applied to many livestock diseases[.]</p></blockquote>
<p>To what I trust is no one&#8217;s great surprise, the model predicts larger losses than just the animals slaughtered:<br />
<blockquote>Model results show large trade-related losses for beef, beef cattle, hogs, and pork, even though relatively few animals are destroyed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even the bromide at the end (&#8220;The best control strategies prove to be those that reduce the duration of the outbreak.&#8221; Really??) doesn&#8217;t change the economic reality: the best way to ensure the highest return is to spend money on inspection.</p>
<p>Anyone who has ever used the financial markets for hedging purposes could tell you that.  It&#8217;s good to see that the USDA has done the analysis to justify a uniform process of inspection of foreign meats; the only question is whether they realise that is what they have done.**</p>
<p>*It is, for instance, common knowledge in some parts of Eastern Europe that, if you are offered lumber at a lower-than-market price, it probably comes from the Chernobyl area.</p>
<p>**This appears to be noting new: here&#8217;s <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?_r=1&#038;res=9D00E1D61F3EE733A2575BC2A96F9C946797D6CF&#038;oref=slogin">a 1906 NYTimes article</a> (PDF) dealing with jurisdiction over testing meats. (That was, of course, the year after <a href="http://www.booksamillion.com/ncom/books?id=4119949291530&#038;isbn=1884365302"><em>The Jungle</em></a> was published. Even then, loopholes were the rule, not long-term sustainability.)</p>
<p>***&#8221;Instead, the officials&#8217; actions seem to me most consistent with believing there are a handful of real cases of BSE out there in the beef cattle population, and that these cases will naturally die out without infecting new cattle over the next several years. Of course, if this were true, a handful of people would be subjected to risk of the deadly disease years after eating a cow whose infection was never discovered.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>I know I promised to back off the pace but yesterday&#8217;s comment thread got temporarily derailed before the point could be made. In yesterday&#8217;s post I highlighted the cash flow in and out of the General Fund to redeem the Trust Fund <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/soc-sec-xiii-crisis-at-shortfall-or.html">&#8216;Crisis&#8217; at Shortfall</a> in an effort to show that in inflation adjusted dollars the payback was no big deal. Well wouldn&#8217;t benefit cuts or a cap increase make the problem even smaller? Well no, you just end up taking the problem out in time by a year or so and make the ultimate cost bigger. Take the numeric series from yesterday for Intermediate Cost or here today for Low Cost and apply the effects of either benefit cuts or tax increase. Once again the left column represents total surplus and so the increase in Trust Fund balance, while the right column represents current year cash flow to or from the General Fund (in constant 2008 dollars). Either a benefit cut or a tax increase will increase the dollars in both columns. A good thing? Well not really. Because the real dollars in the right column from either benefits not being paid in full or more revenue coming are just spent in the current year. If this actually reduced current year borrowing dollar for dollar it would be one thing, but there is no real world evidence that this actually happens. So boom that extra cash is spent. And the left column properly considered is actually an increase in interest earning debt. You are not doing your kids any favors by starving gramma, not if the result is extra payments in the form of future interest on an even bigger interim Trust Fund. The net effect is to move the date of Intermediate Cost shortfall out a bit, and depletion out maybe quite a bit all at the cost of larger needs for future General Fund transfers to pay for that compounding interest. So that is Intermediate Cost. What happens with Low Cost? Well first the numbers, discussion under the fold.</p>
<p>Low Cost Surpluses and Cash Flow to/from the General Fund<br />2010 $236, $106<br />2015 $267, $78<br />2020 $250, $8<br />2025 $217, -$68<br />2030 $170, -$122<br />2035 $169, -$160<br />2040 $205, -$143<br />2045 $273, -$104<br />2050 $358, -$66<br />2055 $455, -$40<br />2060 $567, $17<br />2065 $715, $18<br />2070 $801, $58</p>
<p>What is with the negative numbers? I thought Bruce was always telling us that Low Cost meant fully funded?</p>
<p>Well it does, if you use the Trustees&#8217; definitions of Income and Cost. For the Trustees, who as the name assume have to act as if the Trust Fund is real (after all they are the guardians), Income includes Interest. But if you step back and look at this in the total budget perspective you see that Interest is suddenly transformed from a source of Income to an open obligation on the General Fund. With the results you see above, starting in about 2023 a portion of the interest earned needs to be tapped to pay benefits. But whereas under IC this portion rapidly increases after 2017 and takes in all interest by 2023, under Low Cost the effect always remains partial. In the 2007 Report the result was a system in equilibrium, with approximately 25% of all cost being paid by transfers from the General Fund. Which raises our first problem, in last years Report this subsidy goes on forever, while the utility of the actual dollars borrowed fades as the decades go by. That is not really a good outcome. In the 2008 Report the effect is only worse. Because while the needed transfers grow until about 2035 (though never as high as IC) they start shrinking until in around 2056 the need vanishes completely as Income excluding Interest once again exceeds Cost.</p>
<p>Well the problem is that you now are stuck with a near useless $12 trillion Trust Fund merrily compounding away. But you can&#8217;t just abrogate it by explaining that almost all of it what just the effect of interest on interest and so in some sense disconnected from the real economy. Because the worker of 2056 is going to look at that string of negative numbers from 2023 to 2055 and likely think &#8216;Hell they were real enough when my income tax dollar was being tapped to pay some of that interest&#8217;. But redeeming the now useless Trust Fund to eliminate the future effects of those compound interest dollars requires lowering FICA taxes by enough to offset the total accrued interest plus some extra reductions in rates to allow some gradual paydown on principle. Which means you would have to boost your transfers from 2055&#8217;s $40 billion to at least $470 billion in 2056 simply to keep you in the same place financially. So instead of having to pick up 25% of the tab for a time limited span of 2017 to 2053, here you pay varying portions of the tab through 2055 ramping down to 1% and then get a sharp jump back to 25%, more if you want to take any serious crack at paying down the principle. In effect Low Cost either requires your grandkids simply to accept that they were taxed extra all those years, that now that we didn&#8217;t need the extra income they should just get over it. Or tell them yeah the money is real and we want $470 billion a year forever out of income tax. Just to add some spice to the soup the end result is that Low Income workers who pay little or no income tax get a huge tax cut. Because the only way to make the books balance is to cut FICA back dollar for dollar in relation to that General Fund transfer.</p>
<p>Put this in a matrix with lifetime Low, Medium and High Income Worker on one axis, and Entry age, Median age, and New retiree then start examining where the incidences hit. And who woulda thunk it, the people who get crushed are people earning around the payroll cap.</p>
<p>Okay in this scenario what is the effect of either a benefit cut or a cap increase? Well once again it keeps the numbers in both columns more positive for a longer period of time, that is instead of a negative number from 2023 to 2055 you get a smaller transfer for a shorter period of time. But all that means is an even bigger Trust Fund and more accrued interest at the point of crossover and so an even HIGHER need for General Fund transfers to keep the beast of Interest on Interest from eating you up.</p>
<p>In the cold light of day the &#8216;right&#8217; answer is to take it as you would if you found out that your insurance company made record profits because of lower than expected claims. As long as all your claims were honored, who cares? I&#8217;ll be 99 in 2056. But I have some nieces, nephews and great nieces who will be rapidly approaching retirement at that point. I don&#8217;t see how screwing over Great Gramma Alice and Great Uncle Bruce on their retirement bought them anything more than a huge political mess. That is why benefit cuts and cap increases backfire.</p>

                                <p>Reader Whatever sends along an article on the health system in Singapore written in <a href="http://american.com/archive/2008/may-june-magazine-contents/the-singapore-model">The American</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The People’s Action Party has ruled Singapore since the British left, and is led today by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founder Lee Kuan Yew. It calls the health system it has put in place the “3M” framework: Medisave, Medishield, and Medifund. </p>
<p>Medisave, which covers about 85 percent of all Singaporeans, is a component of a mandatory pension program. Employees typically pay 20 percent of their wages into the Central Provident Fund (CPF), while employers pay 13 percent. (Since 1992, the self-employed have also participated.) At the beginning of 2007, CPF had over $1 billion in surpluses. </p>
<p>In Singapore’s system, the primary role of government is to require people to save in order to meet medical expenses they don’t expect.<br />Medisave accounts can be used to pay directly for hospital expenses incurred by an individual or his immediate family. Limits are in place on the extent of Medisave funds that can be used for daily hospital charges, physicians’ fees, and surgical fees. The idea is to cover fully the bills of most patients in state-subsidized wards of public hospitals. Beyond that, individuals dip into their own pockets or use benefits from insurance plans (see more on this below). Medisave can also be used for expensive outpatient treatments such as chemotherapy, renal dialysis, or HIV drugs. </p>
<p>Medishield, the second part of the program, is a national insurance plan that covers the higher cost of especially serious illness or accident, which in Singapore’s system is described as “catastrophic.” Singaporeans can choose Medishield or several private alternatives, some offered by firms listed on the Singaporean stock exchange. Premiums for the insurance plans, including Medishield, can be paid using Medisave accounts. </p>
<p>Medifund, the third part, was established by the government for the roughly 10 percent of Singaporeans who don’t have the means to pay for their medical needs, despite the government’s subsidy of hospital and outpatient costs. The fund was set up in 1993 with $150 million, with the budget surplus providing additional contributions since then. Only interest income, not capital, may be disbursed. </p>
<p>Finally, there’s Eldershield, an addition to the 3M structure that offers private insurance for disability as a result of old age. It pays a monthly cash allowance to those unable to perform three or more basic activities of daily living. </p>
<p>Nearly all Singaporeans contribute directly toward each treatment, including prescription drugs, through patient co-payments of 20 percent for amounts above deductible levels. The money to meet deductibles and co-payments can come out of a person’s Medisave account.</p></blockquote>
<p>Additional material and comments are below the fold:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>In Singapore’s system, the primary role of government is to require people to save in order to meet medical expenses they don’t expect. While the Singaporean government does regulate prices and services, its hand is nowhere near as heavy as that of governments with extensive nationalized healthcare, such as the United Kingdom or Germany. </p>
<p>John Tucci, head of general insurance consulting for North Asia for Watson Wyatt Insurance Consulting, says, “The use of compulsory savings has been very successful as the main source of private funding for hospital expenses. </p>
<p>“Another key focus of the government has been to ensure that overall health expenditure does not fall victim to the significant inflationary pressures that have been evident throughout the world. This has been achieved by regulating the supply and prices of healthcare services in the country.” Even the United States rations treatments and sets prices both through government regulation and purchasing and through private insurance rules. </p>
<p>The United States spends 15.4 percent of its GDP on healthcare, while Singapore spends just 3.7 percent.<br />Tucci warns that it may be hard to replicate Singapore’s system in the United States. After all, Singapore has a small, concentrated population, with a “backdrop of political stability, enabling successive governments [all of the same party] to introduce consistent measures relating to individual responsibility, compulsory savings, and regulatory control of healthcare services and costs.” </p>
<p>The public healthcare facilities in Singapore have been clustered, since 2002, into two integrated networks, each government-owned and managed as nonprofits: the National Healthcare Group (NHG) on the western side of the city-state, and Singapore Health Services (SingHealth) on the eastern side. Each provides a full range of services, running the public hospitals and specialty centers as private companies. </p>
<p>The Health Ministry says that these clusters “provide cooperation amongst the institutions within the cluster, foster vertical integration of services, and enhance synergy and economies of scale. The friendly competition between the two clusters spurs them to innovate and improve the quality of care while ensuring that medical costs remain affordable.” </p>
<p>Each of the networks also benchmarks against international standards and publishes exhaustive performance figures. In its 2007 report, NHG says its vision is “adding years of healthy life.” The goal, the report says, “departs from merely healing the sick to the more difficult but infinitely more rewarding task of preventing illness and preserving health and quality of life.” </p>
<p>Meanwhile, 80 percent of primary healthcare needs are met by private general practitioners and 20 percent by public outpatient “polyclinics” of hospitals, chiefly those run by the two clusters, NHG and SingHealth. Within the private general practitioner sector, a significant proportion of patients—about 12 percent of them—consult traditional Chinese practitioners. </p>
<p>Phua Kai Hong, associate professor of health policy and management at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, describes the crucial social setting that enabled the country to create its remarkably successful health system: a dynamic economy (with 7.5 percent GDP growth in 2007 and an average income per person of about $34,000, or three-quarters that of the United States), strong family ties and social support systems, a high propensity to save and invest, a rapidly aging and affluent population, and an absence of socialized models of social security, social insurance, or healthcare. </p>
<p>He lists five core prerequisites for countries that may want to emulate Singapore’s system: a willingness and ability to save; high participation in formal employment; effective payroll collection with efficient fund management and claims processing; a well-developed information system with strong security and accounting controls; and effective public education in the proper use of medical accounts. </p>
<p>Within the private-public mix, he says, most people lean toward the private system for primary care and the public system for hospital care. There are 13 public-sector specialty centers and hospitals in Singapore and 16 private-sector hospitals. But 74 percent of the beds are within the public sector. The government has also introduced low-cost community hospitals for intermediate healthcare for the convalescent and aged. </p>
<p>Why does Singapore’s system work? Phua cites these principles: “the creation of incentives for responsible behavior and the efficient delivery of services; the discouragement of overconsumption through cost-sharing; the regulation of hospital beds, doctors, and the use of high-cost medical technology; the promotion of personal responsibility; targeted government subsidies; and the injection of competition through a mix of public- and private-sector providers.” </p>
<p>Medical savings, he says, are now being accumulated to ensure that the Singaporean society of the future will be able to look after its own health needs even with a steady rise in the population of elderly people. </p>
<p>But, he adds, there remains room for further evaluation of clinical quality and outcomes as the system continues to evolve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rdan here:  The article reads like a sales pitch, but perhaps adds to the debate on what is possible for &#8216;savings&#8217; to happen concerning healthcare costs.</p>
<p>1.  If Social Security creates a huge fuss at 6+% collection rates in the US, can you imagine  a proposal for 20% (consumers) and 13% (employers)collections even if it saved money.<br />2.  Singapore has a history of what we would consider draconian solutions.  In this case the governments mandates private savings accounts in a public-private mix.  Does anyone have additional information?</p>

                                <p>Thrilling, I know, but here&#8217;s the fact pattern that drove the discussion anyway:</p>
<p>1. The U.S. government, or organs thereof, commonly preaches free and open markets to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>2. The U.S. market for the delivery of &#8220;letter&#8221; mail (i.e. excluding packages) is subject to statutory monopolies both for delivery of certain types of mail and for access to consumer mailboxes, though there is considerable private provision of mailing services upstream of the delivery function.</p>
<p>3. U.S. postal regulation also until recently involved cost-of-service regulation that Some regarded as highly litigious.</p>
<p>4. The U.S. Postal Service provides its letter mail services at low cost and/or low price compared to nearly every other world postal administration.  (Possible exception regarding the latter, IIRC, the New Zealand post.)</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/27/AR2008052702555.html">Thomas Carothers</a> reminds us that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Proponents of a league only rarely mention the Community of Democracies, created by the United States in 2000, even though it closely parallels the proposed League of Democracies. They don&#8217;t speak of it because the community has been a serious disappointment, producing much talk but little action. Its weak record is not, as some suggest, due to the fact that a few autocratic governments are included. Rather, it reflects the reality that most democracies are unwilling to follow the United States in challenging national sovereignty when it comes to pushing for democracy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Carothers notes this in light of a larger problem with recent U.S. foreign policy:</p>
<blockquote><p>A punishing side effect of Bush&#8217;s policies abroad has been the despoilment of democracy promotion. Abuses of prisoners and detainees at U.S.-run facilities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere have undercut America&#8217;s standing as a defender of human rights. The constant identification of democracy promotion with the Iraq intervention and other regime-change policies has besmirched the very concept in the eyes of many people around the world. As a result, the last thing people in other countries are seeking from the next administration is a high-profile initiative tying democracy promotion to the global U.S. security agenda. The almost complete absence of any welcoming responses from outside the United States to the calls for a league underscores this fact. The idea of a league of democracies rests on the belief that democracies, by virtue of being democracies, have such common interests and perspectives that they will be able to act in unison on global problems. Yet most countries do not base their foreign policy primarily on the orientation of their political system. Instead, their actions reflect a constellation of diverse factors including regional identity, economic needs, historical traditions and religious outlook. Consequently, democracies can and do disagree seriously on basic matters. The United States does not, as Jackson Diehl suggested [op-ed, May 19], meet resistance at the United Nations to its policy initiatives only from nondemocratic states such as Russia and China. Most major developing-country democracies, such as Argentina, Brazil, India, Mexico and South Africa, differ deeply with United States, for example, on the question of interventionism as well as on trade policy, the war on terrorism and much else. Attempting to bind them together into a league with the United States would not change that. Yet excluding these countries from a league would render it a hollow, hypocritical institution. Also, if memory serves, wasn&#8217;t it some of Europe&#8217;s most established democracies that opposed the United States on Iraq? Would they, too, be left out in the interest of a league amenable to approving future U.S. interventions?</p></blockquote>
<p>McCain’s utterances on foreign policy strike me as too similar to the disastrous policies pursued by the current Administration.  His call for a League of Democracies should by itself disqualify him for serious consideration as the next President of the United States.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is normally discussed in terms of Trust Fund Depletion. But given that this event has been pushed back to at least 2041 and boils down to a benefit in real terms 25% better than the one my Mom gets today (78% of 160% = 125%), and that some awareness of this leaked out during the &#8216;There is no crisis&#8217; campaign of 2005, opponents of Social Security had to retool and redefine crisis at Shortfall, which is to say the time that receipts from taxation fall behind Social Security cost and so require the General Fund to start paying back the money it borrowed. Since no serious argument can be made that the debt is not real, because after all they continue to borrow the current surplus presumedly in good faith, instead they pivot to &#8216;explain&#8217; that paying it back will put some intolerable strain on the overall budget and so require massive spending cuts or ruinous taxation increases. But as almost always they never actually put a price tag on this. So lets price Shortfall in inflation adjusted Constant Dollars. Source data here: <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#140103">Table VI.F7.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Constant 2008 Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85&#8243; [In billions]</a></p>
<p>Now generally when people talk about the Social Security surplus they include the accrued interest and talk about the General Fund borrowing $200 billion a year. And viewed from the standpoint of legacy debt this is fair enough, they are assuming future obligations for that amount. But that interest is not in fact financed, the only real cash extracted from the economy and so the only real dollars that can be used to pay for real current spending are the actual excess tax dollars over current costs.  Lots and lots of nummy numbers below the fold.</p>
<p>Between 2008 and 2017 the system is projected to run surpluses, but how much of that is actually cash? In this case the first column represents total surplus, the second cash flow (all under Intermediate Cost assumptions, dollars in billions)<br />2008 $196  $79 <br />2009 $208  $86<br />2010 $214  $84<br />2011 $216  $76<br />2012 $214  $66<br />2013 $209  $52<br />2014 $200  $35<br />2015 $190  $18<br />2016 $180  $2<br />2017 $164  -$19 {oops, had to edit from -$21, which is the net change from 2016 and not the actual transfer for 2017}<br />In light of this we can see how misplaced the hysteria really is. These are not particularly big dollars to start with and over the next ten years the General Fund will be gently weaned off what is in context a pretty meager flow, the idea that a transition from a $2 billion cash surplus in 2016 to a $19 billion dollar cash deficit in 2017 roiling the world credit markets or demanding huge slashes in spending or ruinous tax increase is in numeric context simple nonsense, particularly as here if you adjust the numbers for inflation. But doesn&#8217;t it just get worse going forwards? Well lets see. At this point the table shifts to five year periods meaning we have to interpolate for 2023, the date the total surplus is being tapped and principal has to be repaid. These figures represent total transfers from the General Fund, once again adjusted for inflation. {Oops had to edit, got 2017 and 2023 mixed up the first time around}.</p>
<p>2017    $19<br />2020    $77<br />2023  ~$150<br />2025    $172<br />2030    $258<br />2035    $313<br />2040    $335<br />2042    $0</p>
<p>In short financing Social Security through 2041 means deficits in real terms less than the typical ones run by this Bush Administration and in context much smaller than those run in Reagan/Bush I days. If we exercise even a little restraint on the General Fund side this gap is easily digestible, especially if we note that it is in principle temporary, there is no positive legal obligation for the General Fund to backfill any income/cost gap after 2041. Once you put the numbers in context any real content to &#8216;crisis&#8217; simply melts away. Which is why privatizers never put the numbers in context.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.rcosoftware.com/Articles/ManageGlobalization.pdf">Vladimir Masch</a> has offered some radical solutions to the problems of globalization. In terms of the U.S., here is how he describes the problem:</p>
<blockquote><p>The US is currently in a precarious position, one of the most dangerous in its history. In addition to geopolitical threats, we face a severe economic shock. The enormous wealth of this country is transferred abroad at a high and accelerating rate. To finance our voracious consumption, we borrow from potential adversaries. We lose important industries and millions of middle-class jobs. With the industrial base being destroyed, our security is compromised. The country has lost every important economic weapon that can be used in thorny geopolitical situations, which will prevail in this century.</p></blockquote>
<p>At the heart of the problem is the problem of trade, a problem that few economists have addressed. Instead, we have a &#8220;relentless propaganda&#8221; machine, headed by economists on both the right and on the left&#8211;Krugman and Mankiw are examples&#8211;that globalization as practiced will bring benefits to all. Free Trade is the mantra. And here are the results.</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2006, its current account deficit will probably reach about $900B, or almost 7% of GDP, with its rise accelerating. In just one year, the deficit exceeded more than twice our expense on the Iraq war for four years. The notorious &#8220;bridge to nowhere&#8221; costs $222 million; in foreign trade, we lose that amount every two and a half hours. In 6 to 8 years, just our return payments on foreign holdings on US securities may reach half a trillion dollars a year. A large part of that debt is borrowed from China, our potential adversary; it holds now more than one trillion dollars of currency reserves, predominantly in the US debt securities, and expects to double that amount in four years. This is an ever-growing mortgage on our country, and the situation is unsustainable. Even President Bush, a religious devotee of free trade, says so. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The just completed draft of the Horizon Project, which is intended to be a Marshall type Plan for America and has been authored by eleven eminent CEOs and policy<br />innovators, comes to basically the same conclusions. The Horizon Project talks about &#8220;a hollowing out of American productive and services capacity,&#8221; about &#8220;the US international trade position … being in free fall,&#8221; about &#8220;many U.S. multinational corporations which … seem tempted to off shore almost everything but consumption.&#8221; Consequently, &#8220;The traditional U.S. trade surplus in agricultural products is nearing zero, in high-technology products it has turned negative, and in trade services it is small and declining as a proportion of total trade.&#8221; Moreover, it considers emigration of such industries as chip manufacturing to China, Taiwan and South Korea as &#8220;very unwise,&#8221; as these areas are threatened by potential geopolitical disturbance in the region that might &#8220;greatly diminish U.S. armed forces operations and effectiveness.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The present relatively low rates of inflation and unemployment and satisfactory rates of growth were bought at an enormous price of transferring our wealth and labor force abroad. </p></blockquote>
<p>Vladimir addresses the so-called law of &#8220;comparative advantage&#8221;, which assumes that every country will specialize in what it does best. While theoretically, the law seems elegant and incontrovertible, it ignores important externalities such as adjustment costs&#8211;re-training, etc.</p>
<p>Outsource everything&#8211;full speed ahead. Damn the costs. And, if the money has flowed abroad or into CEO and corporate coffers, who is to pick up the tab? How are we to adjust? How do we pay for re-training? And in what?</p>
<p>We are not talking here about a few people; we are talking about millions of people and uncountable industries. And then, of course, we have to wait&#8211;painfully&#8211;while wages equalize&#8230;if they ever do. And what has been the result: Enormous polarity in the distribution of wealth. So many problems; so little thought has been given to them.</p>
<p>No economist gave any thought to wage disparity; it simply became tucked into the law of comparative advantage.</p>
<p>No economist ever gave thought to labor rights as essential for sound trade. Again, labor rights became a mere externality&#8211;an uncomfortable side issue that deflates the bottom line.</p>
<p>Should the WTO have insisted that China protect labor rights prior to WTO entry? Of course it should have.</p>
<p>Right wingers love to tell us how much better off the poor peasant is in his sweat shop. Does the right winger care about sweatshop labor conditions? Of course not. Meanwhile, the rich get richer. And meanwhile, the U.S. is headed down the tubes.</p>
<p>And while we are at it, let me suggest another difficulty: Specialization has its own difficulties, as I pointed out in this piece: <a href="http://www2.blogger.com/angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/local-or-global.html"><i>Local or Global</i></a> .</p>
<p>Specialization puts any country at risk, especially in key commodities. And if big players with deep pockets can quickly shift money to exploit the problems, what then? According to one wag, 60% of the cost of oil is a result of one such shift. (While I do not agree with this figure, many here apparently do. And if they do, what say they then about free trade?)</p>
<p>Vladimir has described the problem, at least for the U.S. And what is his answer: Trade balances must be controlled. He suggests the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Congress sets annual limits (upper bounds) on the overall U.S. trade deficit in consumer goods and undesirable capital goods (oil and gas excluded)</li>
<li>The President of the U.S. allocates the allowed deficit for each of our trading counterparts—countries or groups of countries</li>
<li>A country may exceed the limit if its government pays the U.S. Treasury a stipulated percentage (up to the full amount) of the excess deficit, also approved for each country by the President of the U.S. These payments may be capped</li>
<li>To raise the money for excess deficit payments, our trading counterparts may either use export taxes and export certificate auctions or pay from their currency reserves</li>
</ol>
<p>Interesting, but I think unworkable.</p>
<p>Imagine telling China that it must compensate us for its trade surplus! And what do we say to poor Mexico? Or to Canada? Send us our monthly check, please.</p>
<p>My own solution is three-fold and it is based on the following&#8211;over 60% of China&#8217;s exports are from foreign companies inside of China. Unless we address that uncomfortable fact&#8211;almost 80% in IT&#8211;, our goose is cooked.</p>
<ol>
<li>Insist that all countries protect labor rights. No more fast track trade deals that are merely grease for our companies to find cheap labor.</p>
</li>
<li>Reform the WTO or withdraw from it. The WTO should immediately start a process whereby all WTO countries move towards an acceptable standard for the protection of labor. Better late then never.</li>
<li>Tax goods that U.S. companies make with cheap overseas labor. Put a price on outsourcing and offshoring. Hey, Intel and Apple, no more free rides. Hey, Walmart, your prices are going up. Time to compete fairly.</li>
</ol>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Yesterday afternoon, a trio of fellow <a href="http://crri.rutgers.edu/references/post/index.html">Conference on Postal and Delivery Economics</a> attendees and I were marveling at the emptiness of the A2 motorway connecting the southern exburbs of Lisbon and the Algarve region.  Certainly, there is not a whole lot of stuff en route, but you could say the same thing about a lot of points 250 km apart along the Interstate highway system west of the Mississippi River; those are not that lightly-traveled.</p>
<p>There are income and substitution effects to consider: Portugal&#8217;s per-capita GDP is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economy_of_the_European_Union#Economic_variation">75% of the EU average</a> (or less than 2/3ds that of Rich Europe), and fuel was dear at around €1.50/liter — though the preponderance of small diesel-powered cars implies a much smaller difference in per-km costs versus the U.S. than you&#8217;d get from the pump price.  But one of the bigger hits was the toll of almost €19.  A 150-km ride on the Pennsylvania Turnpike a couple weeks ago for another conference was $4; the Illinois Northwest Tollway, highly congested in the Chicago suburbs and exurbs, only hits you up for $2 between the Wisconsin state line and the toll-free city Chicago expressways if you use the system enough to shell out for an I-Pass transponder (they price-discriminate by charging twice the I-Pass toll for cash, which for all I know may be going on here, too).</p>
<p>This makes me think that the main concern for the privatization of tollways is less the outsourcing of toll-raising dirty work to the private sector so much as whether the states are adequately compensated for such right to raise the tolls as they sell. (*)</p>
<p>* To possibly forestall certain lines of comments, I don&#8217;t actually support government eating-of-capital as a politically expedient alternative to raising other taxes.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know for certain, but I&#8217;d guess that the ACRE program is part of the 4.930 B.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quick explanation of why these changes are taking place.</p>
<p>The ACRE program now being introduced is designed to be a permanent disaster assistance program. It&#8217;s intended to replace ad-hoc disaster assistance that Congress provides on a frequent basis &#8211; particularly in election years.</p>
<p>From a broad perspective, disaster assistance should be understood as being free crop insurance. Farmers recover their losses once under their crop insurance policies and then a second time via disaster aid. What could be sweeter? However, to reach an agreement on this bill, Congress was forced to take money out of the crop insurance program in order to fund the ACRE program. This was done by reducing the overlap in payments between the two programs.</p>
<p>Of course, major legislative changes like this don&#8217;t just happen by accident. The concept of a permanent disaster aid program (though not necessarily the ACRE program itself) was being pushed by a number of the farm commodity groups, which wanted greater assurance that money would be available on a timely basis. Also, certain commodity groups were due to lose a large portion of their government commodity program payments due to high crop prices. By proposing a new federal program, the commodity groups were able to establish a much higher price support guarantee than farmers would have received if the existing programs had simply been extended. Voila! The money will still be headed their way.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that the ACRE program is all bad. Considering how much money Congress has been providing in ad-hoc disaster aid recently, it&#8217;s possible that total expenditures may actually go down under the ACRE program. Of course, this assumes that Congress will finally stop passing ad-hoc disaster assistance legislation.</p>
<p>Let me just say that my experiences during the past several months remind me of the old saying that you never want to watch sausages or legislation being made.</p></blockquote>
