<blockquote><p> Baghdad &#8211; The authorities in Baghdad say they are preparing for an exodus of thousands of people from eastern parts of the city.<br />    Fighting between government and US troops on one side, and Shia militia on the other, has intensified recently.</p>
<p>    Two football stadiums are on stand-by to receive residents from two neighbourhoods in the Sadr City area.</p>
<p>    The government has warned of an imminent push to clear the areas of members of the Mehdi Army, loyal to the anti-American cleric, Moqtada Sadr.</p>
<p>    In the last seven weeks around 1,000 people have died, and more than 2,500 others have been injured, most of them civilians.</p>
<p>    The fighting so far in Sadr City has been fierce &#8211; street to street, and house to house.</p>
<p>    Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki is showing a determination to disarm the country&#8217;s Shia militia groups &#8211; particularly the Mehdi Army &#8211; that he has never displayed before.</p>
<p>    However, Iraqi army operations, backed by US ground and air support, have so far failed to overwhelm the Shia militiamen, who are still responding with roadside bombs, sniper fire, mortars and rockets.</p>
<p>    The government has distributed leaflets in two key districts of Sadr City, warning people to leave.</p>
<p>    The speculation is that government forces are preparing for a big push into eastern Baghdad to end the current fighting once and for all.</p>
<p>    Shortages of water and medical supplies have already made life inside Sadr City extremely difficult.</p></blockquote>
<p>The urban renewal program might have a second phase starting with this push.</p>

Colbert makes his case for free gas.  If he runs for President – will he select Greg as his economic advisor?  This is definitely worth the look as it is a hoot.</p>

<blockquote><p>Monday’s data from the Institute for Supply Management is our first real glimpse at the second quarter of 2008 — you know, the one we’re in now. The above chart shows that the service sector — which is by far a better guide to the ebbs and flows of our economy than the manufacturing one — bottomed in January and has been recovering steadily ever since. It is now at an expansionary 52 percent. (Anything above 50 is positive growth territory.) When you hear a recessionista say, “Yes, we grew in the first quarter, but since then . . . blah, blah, blah,” show them this ISM report. The service sector has only gotten stronger since the first quarter ended. The recession that never was seems to be over.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m not sure I qualify as a recessionistas and quite frankly I’m not sure anyone does.  But I certainly have not been saying we were about to head for a recession for all of the past five years.  But it is true that the service sector enjoyed an increase in employment equal to 90 thousand last month according to <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">this source</a>.  But then the manufacturing sector suffered an employment reduction equal to 110 thousand.  But hey – why work in a factory jump if you can flip hamburgers for Burger King?  </p>
<p>Look, I realize that the National Review staff thinks that its readers are really stupid.  But c’mon, the garbage put out by Mr. Bowyer is so dumb that it has to been insulting to the dumbest of their readers.</p>

                                <p>I want to talk about something of which I know nothing: Wireless Internet Access.</p>
<p>We spent the weekend in pgl-land (NYC), at a friend&#8217;s apartment.  Since he&#8217;s a rather prominent computer graphics designer, I assumed, incorrectly, that he would have some form of Internet access at home.*</p>
<p>So I did what I always do: opened the laptop and searched for an available wireless access point.</p>
<p>At no time were there less than 15 indicated.  And while most of these were &#8220;Security-Enabled,&#8221; I get the impression that either (1) that has become the default setting for service in the past few years or (2) enough people have been persuaded by the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">FUD</a> campaigns of MSFT and others that they read that part of the instruction manual.**</p>
<p>I had kids to distract, so access to barbie.com or dailynoggin was important.  That is, I would have been willing to pay a few dollars for a weekend&#8217;s worth of access, or <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/technology/06wifi.html?_r=1%26oref=slogin%26ref=business%26pagewanted=print">some equivalent thereof</a>.  If there were a market available.</p>
<p>And, probably, at least a few of those 15 or so router-owners—badger or linksys or 5AMews—would have been willing to make a few dollars providing some of  their excess capacity to my 54.0Mbps laptop. If there were a market available.</p>
<p>But there wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Or, more likely, there was, but the effort wasn&#8217;t worth it.  One of the key aspects of economic analysis is the assumption that markets (1) clear [both buyer and seller voluntarily agree on a price] and (2) are efficient [everyone involved in the market has all the information they need to make a rational decision on what the clearing price is/will be].</p>
<p>In the real world, investment banks spend millions of dollars to attain that &#8220;efficiency.&#8221;*** Nor is anyone of the illusion that the terms of all transactions are completely voluntary on both sides.  But those are variations on the model, and the markets created from or supported by them, while not an economic ideal, can be analyzed as variations.</p>
<p>What happens when there just is not a market?</p>
<p>In the case here, I have no way of knowing who the local providers are or, more importantly, where they are.  Badger could be my next-door neighbor, or two floors away and at the other end of the building.  So I would have to spend time
<ol>
<li>knocking on doors, interrupting people (including some who have no capability themselves; there are many more than 15 apartments in the building),</li>
<li>having discussions with some people who might have non-economic reasons not to agree to permit me access (including FUD),</li>
<li>(c) finding people who really do use all of their capacity,****</li>
<li>finding people who could provide access but with whom I cannot agree on a clearing price, and</li>
<li>either
<ol>
<li>finally, finding someone with whom I can come to a market agreement or</li>
<li>giving up and depending either on unguarded WAPs or finding an alternative.</li>
</ol>
<p></li>
</ol>
<p>In all scenarios, even 5(2), I have spent some portion of time, possibly significant, that must be included in the Full Cost of the Search.</p>
<p>Which is probably why there is not an active secondary market in Wireless Internet Access in the United States.</p>
<p>The consequences of this specific example are left as an exercise.  The consequences of the problems with Price Discovery are To Be Continued.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Felix Salmon <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/05/06/how-to-monetize-free-wi-fi">wonders about the need for price discovery in commercial WiFi</a>:<br />
<blockquote>If I&#8217;m looking for a wi-fi network, it&#8217;s easy to see which ones are encrypted and which are open. But of the open networks, it&#8217;s impossible to see which ones are genuinely open and which ones will take you only to a sign-on page which asks for a credit card number and which often doesn&#8217;t work&#8230;.A network which purports to offer free wi-fi should do just that: firewalled wi-fi should look different somehow.</p></blockquote>
<p>*No DVD player, VCR, or television, either; not a keeping-the-kids-busy-without-touching-things place.</p>
<p>**I am convinced that it&#8217;s not out of actual knowledge because several of the &#8220;secure&#8221; networks were still named linksys, Apple Network ######, or similar. It may not be true, but it is the way to bet.</p>
<p>***As <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/quick-one-infaltionary-credit-recession.html#696959">cactus noted</a>, the EMH is of dubious value if there is a significant disconnect between the alignments of the financial markets and those of &#8220;main street.&#8221; But let&#8217;s pretend it works for the normal &#8220;markets&#8221; model.</p>
<p>****Highly unlikely, for reasons to be discussed in another post.</p>

<p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080507/ap_on_bi_go_ec_fi/economy">Martin Crutsinger</a> reports – and opines:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Labor Department reported Wednesday that productivity, the amount of output per hour of work, increased at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter. That was slightly higher than the 1.5 percent increase which had been expected.  In a sign that inflation could be easing, labor cost pressures slowed a bit. Unit labor costs rose at an annual rate of 2.2 percent, down from a 2.8 percent rise in the final three months of last year. While rising wages and benefits are good for employees, those increases can lead to higher inflation if businesses are forced to boost the cost of their products to cover the higher payroll costs. However, if productivity is increasing it allows businesses to finance higher wages out of the increased output.</p></blockquote>
<p>He is assuming that the higher productivity is attributable to strong real GDP growth but real GDP growth has been quite weak for the past two quarters.  Could it be that the ratio of output to labor hours rose because fewer people have jobs?  Perhaps as his report later notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Private economists believe the weakening economy will dampen inflation pressures. However, the sharp economic slowdown is occurring at the same time that energy and food prices have continued to rise.  Many analysts think that the country has already toppled into a recession. But overall economic growth, as measured by the gross domestic product, eked out a tiny 0.6 percent rate of increase in the first three months of the year, the same anemic pace as the final three months of last year. The rise in productivity in the first three months of the year occurred as the number of hours worked declined at an annual rate of 1.8 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me also object to his concern that nominal wages were rising too quickly.  If nominal wages fail to keep pace with rising consumer prices, we see reduced real wages.  As our graph of the real wage for nonsupervisory workers show, real wages for some have not increased that much over the past five years.</p>

<div></div>
<div>Outcome II shows the standard narrative. A Trust Fund Ratio rising to a peak in 2017  then a more or less rapid falloff to zero as the first the interest is tapped and then the principal is redeemed with the result of total Trust Fund Depletion in 2041.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Outcome III or High Cost shows the same process only accelerated.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Outcome I or Low Cost shows a much different picture. The Trust Fund ratio peaks at about 450 about 2020 then dips to 390 by around 2040 as a portion of the interest is tapped but after a period of plateau sharply increases through the remainder of the 75 year actuarial window. This is quite literally the picture of a potentially overfunded Social Security system. Is a Low Cost outcome guaranteed? Well no. Is it possible? Certainly the numbers are not at all outlandish and perfectly in line with economic performance over the last fifteen years.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Can we at least talk about the implications of this?</div>
<p>Well I just copied this over from the Bruce Web in response to a comment from Jim A on the previous post. Some explanation of terminology is in order here. First the three curves represent the three different alternatives supplied by the Trustees. The only one generally reported in outcome II or Intermediate Cost, with the other two (High Cost and Low Cost) supposedly representing the outward bounds. In point of fact for the years 1997 to 2004 the deviation from Intermediate Cost was always in the direction of Low Cost and often exceeded its numbers.</p>
<p>Social Security solvency is measured in two ways. One is by payroll gap which is to say the amount that the payroll tax would have to be raised immediately or contrawise at Trust Fund Depletion to fully fund the current schedule of benefits. Per the 2008 Report those figures are 1.7% and 3.54% respectively, numbers that have trended down significantly since the 1997 Report. The second measure is Trust Fund Ratio which is to say Trust Fund assets measured as a function of time with 1 year = 100. Under current law (or perhaps simply practice) Actuarial Balance is defined as having a Trust Fund Ratio of 100 for each of the next 10 years (Short Term Actuarial Balance) or the next 75 years (Long Term Actuarial Balance). In 2003 a new measure was added which would have us evaluate actuarial balance over the &#8216;Infinite Future Horizon&#8217;. This was in my opinion a simple gimmick to allow opponents of Social Security to use really scary numbers rather than focus on the traditional and reasonable 75 year planning window, a window that pretty much covers the interests of most peoples children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>Now in examining the graph we can see Low Cost (outcome I) we see a sharp acceleration of the TF Ratio after 2060 with it exiting the 75 year window at 650. This is dangerously high, that is if we consider the Trust Fund and more significantly the interest it earns as being a real asset. And we should because otherwise we would be arguing for what pgl calls a backdoor employment tax that called on one sub-set of Americans to subsidize General Fund spending. And theoretically there is an argument to be had there but it sure puts &#8216;paid&#8217; to the &#8216;poor people don&#8217;t pay taxes&#8217; narrative the Right is so fond of. But in point of fact flattening the tail down to where the Trust Fund is at its nominal target of 100 is difficult, the only way of doing that is to starve the beast by cutting payroll tax rates and using General Fund dollars now rather than later to pay down the Trust Fund. Because the longer you wait the higher the proportion of Cost has to be born by the General Fund as opposed to FICA to keep interest on interest from bloating the TF. This is incidentally why cutting benefits or increasing revenues by such measures as raising the cap are counterproductive, they simply increase the amount of accrued interest without actually benefitting anyone today.</p>
<p>Of course this whole discussion is moot if we actually get outcome II or Intermediate Cost. Our choice of policy going forward is entirely dependent on whether future outcomes are closer to II or I which in turn requires an examination of the assumptions underlying Intermediate Cost and Low Cost in light of the fact that most of the bias over the last 12 years has been strongly to the upside. Yet all of the policy discussion to date simply clings to Intermediate Cost assumptions and considers the problem to be one of deficit in 2041 when it is not clear that is at all the most likely outcome.</p>
<p>Next post or so we&#8217;ll stick in some actual projected growth numbers. In the meanwhile you can ponder the implications of a $117 trillion Trust Fund in 2085 (Low Cost projection) <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#150920">Table VI.F8.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Current Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions]</a></p>

<p>So I just want start easy, and take a look at three easy-to-compare data points:<br />First, <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/fomc/fundsrate.htm">the Federal Funds target rate</a> since 2007 (I include the last change in 2006 since it was the rate for the first 8.5 months of 2007):

<p>If you make money easier to get, standard theory says that people will get it.  While this raises the &#8220;threat&#8221; of inflation, it makes credit easier to get as well.  So the theory goes.</p>
<p>Steven J. Balassi (h/t <a href="http://www.26econ.com/newly-added-econ-blogs/">Aaron Schiff</a> for bringing his blog to my attention) <a href="http://worldlyeconomicthoughts.blogspot.com/2008/05/tighter-lending.html">notes that this isn&#8217;t happening</a>. Pull quote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Friends in the mortgage industry are telling me you have to be &#8220;rich&#8221; just to get a home loan now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even granting I have <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/05/our-house.html">a vested interest right now</a> in peole being able to get mortgages, this is keeping the market from clearing and expanding the housing crisis.  Again, contrary to the theory that easier money means, well, easier to get money.</p>
<p>So we have easier money and tighter credit.  The implication is that the banks are keeping that money, no circulating it. No wonder they <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/05/another-tool-fo.html">want to be paid interest on reserve requirements</a>.*</p>
<p>But what about the inflation fears of easier money? Surely, if the money is not circulating, that shouldn&#8217;t be a fear?</p>
<p>Not so fast, says <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/05/06/kc-feds-hoenig-worries-about-inflation-psychology/">Kansas City Fed  President Thomas Hoenig</a> (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/05/links-for-200-6.html">Mark Thoma</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Hoenig said rising inflationary pressures are &#8220;troublesome&#8221; and a &#8220;serious&#8221; matter. &#8220;The bigger concern is that these increases are beginning to generate an inflation psychology to an extent that I have not seen since the 1970s and early 1980s,&#8221; he said. Hoenig added that &#8220;there is a significant risk that higher inflation will become embedded in the economy and require significant monetary policy tightening to reduce it.&#8221; He tied rising prices primarily to overseas factors, including a &#8220;sizable decline&#8221; in the U.S. dollar’s value.</p></blockquote>
<p>Welcome to the Global Economy.  But Hoenig is sanguine about the Fed Funds rate, even if he is willing to use the R word:<br />
<blockquote>Hoenig’s views on the economy were relatively upbeat, even as he described the nation as being &#8220;at the brink of a recession.&#8221; He suggested interest rates were close to where they needed to be.</p>
<p>&#8220;The current accommodative stance should be sufficient to cushion the economy<br />from a deeper slowdown and the risks that financial disruptions could spill over to the broader economy,&#8221; he said. As the economy and markets improve &#8220;it will be necessary for the Federal Reserve to remove the policy accommodation in a timely manner.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing &#8220;room for optimism,&#8221; Hoenig said &#8220;financial markets appear to have stabilized somewhat, and the economy should pick up in the second half of the year as fiscal and monetary stimulus take hold.&#8221; The official said he believe markets’ role in the current turmoil has been overstated, and that higher energy prices and housing woes have exacted the greater toll. He also said he believes the &#8220;credit crunch&#8221; hasn’t proved as damaging as some had feared.</p></blockquote>
<p>So there we have it.  We have inflation, but cutting rates was the right thing.  And the credit crunch isn&#8217;t too bad, even if only the rich can buy a house.  And that 325 basis points of easing in the past eight months just hasn&#8217;t gotten into the economy yet; give the banks another six months or so.</p>
<p>I feel better; how about you?</p>
<p>*Meanwhile, I am reliably informed that Bank of America just cut the rates on their (currently in place) contracts with consultants by 5-15%, depending on length of service (greater for longer).</p>

<blockquote><p>BAGHDAD &#8211; Forget rocket attacks, concrete blast walls and no sewer system and try picturing luxury hotels, a shopping center and even condos in the heart of Baghdad.</p>
<p>It’s all part of an ambitious five-year development “dream list” to transform the U.S.-protected Green Zone from a walled fortress into a gleaming centerpiece for Baghdad’s future.</p>
<p>The $5 billion plan has Pentagon backing and apparently the interest of leading hotel developers, said Navy Capt. Thomas Karnowski, who led the team that created the development plan.</p>
<p>Washington wants to create a “zone of influence” around the new $700 million U.S. Embassy to serve as a high-end buffer for the compound, whose total price tag will reach about $1 billion after all the workers and offices are relocated over the next year.</p>
<p>“When you have $1 billion hanging out there and 1,000 employees lying around, you kind of want to know who your neighbors are. You want to influence what happens in your neighborhood over time,” said Karnowski.</p>
<p>Karnowski said a deal was already completed for Marriott International Inc. to build a hotel in the Green Zone.</p>
<p>He also said a possible $1 billion investment could come from MBI International, a conglomerate that&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, there you go.  Are they planning on a drawing down of US troops?</p>

                                <blockquote><p>The church currently leases space in the steeple for the antennas of two wireless phone companies, AT&#038;T and T-Mobile. The rent from these leases currently provides almost $70,000 of annual income to the church. Up until last year, the church leased space to three wireless companies. Because of industry consolidation, we lost one of these leases and the rent that it provided in June 2007.</p>
<p>We have been approached over the past several years by firms interested in purchasing our remaining two cell leases. These inquiries have been getting more and more attractive and the Board decided to fully investigate the possibility of selling our remaining two cell leases. We decided to hire an independent consultant to review the current proposals and to assist us in determining whether selling the two leases would be in the best long term interest of the Church. That consultant has completed his report and has concluded that it is financially beneficial to accept one of these offers at this time. Their report indicates that our offers are at the very top of the range for similar cell lease buyouts, and that market valuations are currently at a peak. </p>
<p>We will be taking this to the Congregational Meeting on May 18 for a presentation and vote, but our thorough analysis has revealed that there are several compelling reasons for selling our cell leases at this time, including: (1) obtaining a substantial sum of money ($$$,000) that can be used to significantly increase our endowment. This will enhance the financial stewardship of the church well into the future, and it will also have the added benefit of substantially increasing the annual distribution that the church receives each year from the trust, thereby helping to support our growth; and (2) eliminating the risk of losing one or both of our remaining cell leases and the significant negative impact this would have on our operating budget since each lease currently provides $35,000, approximately 10% of our annual budget. We already lost one of the original three leases due to industry consolidation, resulting in a loss of annual income of approximately $32,000 this year, and the remaining two have a right to terminate at any time with 90 days notice.</p></blockquote>
<p>I received the following note today, and it reminded me of cactus&#8217;s thoughts on the tax free status of churches, charitable deductions, and how money is used to qualify for &#8216;tax free&#8217; status of one kind or another. Sammy also challenged who gave more, conservatives or liberals, based on income and percentage claimed. </p>
<p>He used basketball courts as an example, but I also thought of Hagee, Wright, and others in the spotlight. It was also a couple weeks ago that about 30 teens and chaperons from this church went to New Orleans to help re-build a church and a house in the ninth ward of New Orleans, now a twice a year event.</p>
<p>It is worth exploring again the rules of what is worth worshipping, and how.  Each kind of giving has its own worth, but how does one measure worth without the use of money on a blog like this?</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EconomistsView/~3/284935127/tax-policy-and.html">Mark Thoma</a> points to Thomas Palley playing lightning rod with &#8220;<a href="http://www.thomaspalley.com/?p=107">Tax Policy and the House Price Bubble</a>.&#8221;  With a title like that, you might expect a prima facie case for a causal link between tax preferences for homeownership and the bubble, but Palley&#8217;s lede is deeply buried and there turns out not to be a lot of there there.  The central issue is that there&#8217;s no obvious variation in tax policy that is associated with the bubble.  More after the jump.</p>
<p>Plenty of Sensible Economists have sniped at the mortgage interest deduction among other favorable tax treatments for homeownership.  Reforming, though not eliminating, the mortgage interest deduction also was a recommendation of the <a href="http://www.taxreformpanel.gov/">Tax Reform Panel</a> whose report was broadly ignored after its 2005 publication gave some of us in the econoblogiverse plenty of material (for anyone interested, my contemporary blogging on the subject is <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2005/11/tax-reform-greatest-hits.html">linked here</a>).  Palley recites the traditional indictment: the tax policies are expensive (*), pay the middle- to upper-middle classes to do something they&#8217;d do anyway (**), are unfair to low-income taxpayers who don&#8217;t itemize or otherwise get a smaller deduction (***), and by increasing house prices work somewhat at cross purposes to the notional intent of making housing more affordable.  Fair enough.</p>
<p>Thing is, as far as the housing bubble is concerned, none of this is new.  The deduction was distorting the housing market well into pre-bubble history.  Indeed, the reductions in marginal tax rates affecting most middle- and upper-income taxpayers ought, in principle, to have reduced the distortion on the margin.  Here, for instance, is the CPI-adjusted OFHEO house price index against the marginal tax rate applicable to a family with a constant-dollar income somewhat north of mine (****):</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/21392874@N00/2473571200/" title="Marginal Tax Rates and House Prices by atbozzo, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2379/2473571200_40e747b6f4.jpg" alt="Marginal Tax Rates and House Prices" height="340" width="500"></a></p>
<p>Correlation is not causality, of course, but the simple correlation here is negative (-0.55).  Moreover, there isn&#8217;t any clear connection between the major changes in tax policy over the period and bubbly prices, unless someone can account for the rather variable lag structures.  The 1986 tax reform eliminated the deductibility of non-mortgage interest, which in particular made home-equity credit relatively attractive; in 1997, the capital-gains treatment for owner-occupied housing changed.  In both cases, at least using the CPI adjustment, prices had started recovering from their local troughs before enactment of the changes.</p>
<p>The &#8217;97 change — which replaced a tax deferral for homeownership capital gains rolled into another residence with a flat exemption of $250,000 for an individual (twice that for joint filers) — is tricky.  It does favor owner-occupied housing as an asset class by making something of a Roth IRA out of one&#8217;s house.  However, the benefits relative to previous law only assert themselves upon exit of the owner-occupied housing market, and the complete tax deferral of rolled-over equity may have been worth more in the short run to movers up or down in areas with high nominal appreciation.  Also, this was enacted against the backdrop of a right-of-center program to reduce taxation of capital income; I tend to the view that there&#8217;s not a lot of distortion between a zero capital gains tax rate and the low rates that currently prevail for other long-term gains.</p>
<p>So Palley is left with a rather tenuous assertion connecting the bubble and tax policy:<br />
<blockquote>The tax system has helped create a cult of home ownership, and that cult appears to have been an ingredient in the recent house price bubble.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the tax preferences exactly hurt the cult&#8217;s marketing, but let&#8217;s face facts: to explain the bubble, it&#8217;s necessary to find factors associated more-or-less with the bubble era, and from that perspective it should be amply clear that the irrational exuberance came roaring out of the financial world. The cult part was all the spinning of tales for why houses were just like stocks in the late-90s except for the crashing back to earth part, combined with the deployment of financial technologies which, while not necessarily dangerous per se (*****), certainly bore risks of unintended consequences that were broadly ignored.  So now we have a socialized financial system (at least on the downside), woohoo!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I&#8217;m skeptical to say the very least regarding claims that we&#8217;d be living in a paradise of economic dynamism if only we were all unencumbered by our illiquid and inconvenient owned housing.  Long-term wage stagnation is a huge problem, but one that can&#8217;t fairly be placed at homeownership above other causes.</p>
<p>So Palley has some reasonably sensible reform plans that someone might phase in, but I&#8217;m not going to tell anyone that a bit of political capital ought to be spent on them that might otherwise be spent extracting us from <a href="http://icasualties.org/oif/">George and Dick&#8217;s Excellent Adventure</a> or breaking our addictions to oil and/or GHG emissions — both of which are far more difficult and urgent.</p>
<p>(*) $80 billion is a lot of money, but at ~3% of the federal budget, not the biggest boondoggle in annual expenditures.</p>
<p>(**) Distastefully inefficient to the extent it&#8217;s true.</p>
<p>(***) Also true in large part, though non-itemizers do have the standard deduction.</p>
