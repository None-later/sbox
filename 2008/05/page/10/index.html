<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/stephen-moore-looks-at-mississippi.html">Cactus</a> has caught <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121037876256182167.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">Stephen Moore</a> lying to the readers of the Wall Street Journal again:</p>
<blockquote><p>For most of the past 30 years, Mississippi has ranked as one of the poorest as well as one of the most litigious states. The two statistics are related … Shortly after winning election in 2003 by running on a tort-reform platform, Mr. Barbour stitched together a coalition of doctors, business groups, taxpayers and even unions to roll back the trial lawyer lobby … Almost overnight, the flow of lawsuits began to dry up and businesses started to trickle in … About 60,000 new jobs have arrived in four years – not a small number in a workforce of about 1.3 million – and a sharp improvement from the 30,000 jobs lost in the four years before Mr. Barbour took office … Thanks to Mr. Barbour, the state&#8217;s unemployment rate is down to about 6% from nearly 9%. Last year, Mississippi&#8217;s per capita income growth was 6.7%, third highest of the 50 states and well above the national average of 5.2%. Mississippi tort reform is making the poor richer</p></blockquote>
<p>We have graphed both the state’s employment as well as its unemployment rate from January 1998 to March 2008 using <a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?la+28">this source</a>.  As far as the unemployment rate, we see a clear indication of a Katrina bounce, which has come and gone, but no evidence of any alleged litigation relief effect.  We also see a Katrina effect, which came during Barbour’s tenure and has shift dissipated.  Now it is true that during Bush’s first term in office, employment growth was negative in Mississippi but wasn’t it negative for most of the nation?  Once one graphs the employment series and thinks about the effects of Katrina and that recession a few years back – it is hard to see anything of a litigation relief effect at all.  </p>
<p>As far as the growth in per capita (nominal) income, Cactus would have us look at <a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/spi/spi_newsrelease.htm">this source</a> which states:</p>
<blockquote><p>Louisiana grew 10.5 percent in 2007, down from 20.6 percent in 2006. These growth rates are substantially higher than any other state&#8217;s. The rental income component of Louisiana&#8217;s personal income was boosted in 2007 by $5.4 billion of Road Home subsidies from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The subsidies are to persons whose homes had been destroyed or damaged by Hurricane Katrina. Mississippi, whose Homeowners&#8217; Assistance Program was funded $1.5 billion by HUD, grew 7.4 percent in 2007 up from 6.0 percent in 2006.</p>
<p>Per capita income. U.S. per capita income grew 5.2 percent in 2007, down from 5.6 percent in 2006, but equal to the average of the last four years (2004-07). Louisiana&#8217;s per capita income was up 9.2 percent or $2,935. Much of the gain in Louisiana is accounted for by the Road Home subsidies which averaged nearly $1,250 per Louisiana resident. In Mississippi, housing subsidies added $530 to per capita income.</p></blockquote>
<p>Additionally, the state&#8217;s per capita income in 2007 was only $28,845 which ranks it 50 out of 50 again.  Could someone at the Wall Street Journal kindly suggest to Mr. Moore’s that such blatant abuse of the data to make a phony argument is not an appropriate thing for this business newspaper to do?</p>

                                <p>Tom&#8217;s working on explaining Savings 101, so this is specifically to deal with the &#8220;issue with&#8221; retirement accounts.</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://laglux.blogspot.com/2008/05/teeny-weeny-mistakes.html">Lawrence G. Lux</a>, we find the A.P. (and maybe the NYT) highlighting a &#8220;study&#8221; by an investment management firm that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-Savings-Mistakes.html?pagewanted=print">&#8220;discovers&#8221; problems with the way people manage their 401(k)s</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Some of the diversification problems stemmed from concentrated holdings of company stock. Experts urge savers to hold no more than 10 percent to 15 percent of their accounts in company stock, pointing out that they could sustain significant losses if the company runs into trouble or goes bankrupt.</p>
<p>The Financial Engines study found that among savers eligible to receive company stock, more than one-third had more than 20 percent of their holdings in the company&#8217;s shares. Some older workers had more than half their holdings in company stock, and workers with salaries under $25,000 also held a disproportionate amount of company stock, the study found.</p>
<p>On the level of savings, the study found that just 7 percent of 401(k) participants were saving the maximum allowed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Much of that is common sense. (Think Enron: the time when your company stock will be least value to you also will be the time you may need to borrow against your retirement account.)</p>
<p>Some of it, likely, is the way the plans are offered. (Again, think Enron.) Public companies tend to offer their stock as part of a &#8220;retirement plan,&#8221; and many &#8220;investors&#8221; are told to invest in &#8220;what you know.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, the absurd claim in the lede of the AP piece (&#8220;Despite extensive efforts to educate workers about saving for retirement&#8221;) is belied by two realities.  One is noted by Lux:<br />
<blockquote>Look, Maw, those damned Kids don’t know how to manage their (401)k Funds. When are they going to learn that they have to spend 20 hrs. per Week evaluating good potential Investments. Listen to them complain that they don’t have the time–between raising children and working a 50-hour Workweek. (italics removed)</p></blockquote>
<p>the other comes from anyone who knows a bit of history and remembers that pensions have been historically underfunded (or raided) by management.  If trained money managers couldn&#8217;t do a good job in the Glory Days of Defined Benefit (and, make no mistake, a literal reading of economic theory would lead anyone to believe those were the glory days), then expecting people who do <em>not</em> specialize in managing money to allocate &#8220;appropriately&#8221; should be, on the face of it, absurd.</p>
<p>Finally, some of the problem likely is due to constraint optimization issues. (Short version: You can only save what you don&#8217;t have to spend.) Let us rewrite this paragraph:<br />
<blockquote>Nearly two-thirds of those earning less than $25,000 a year don&#8217;t contribute enough to get the full company match, the study found. But 24 percent of those earning $50,000 to $75,000 a year and 12 percent of those earning more than $100,000 a year didn&#8217;t get the full match, either.</p></blockquote>
<p>as<br />
<blockquote>Only slgihtly more than one-third of those earning less than $25,000 a year have enough disposable income to get the full company match, the study found. Meanwhile, 76 percent of those earning $50,000 to $75,000 a year and 88 percent of those earning more than $100,000 a year were able to qualify for the full match.</p></blockquote>
<p>But that makes it clear, as divorced one like Bush noted in <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/8373322695349287248/#697629">a comment to vtcodger&#8217;s post</a>:<br />
<blockquote>You don&#8217;t invest in the market until you have money you can afford to lose.</p></blockquote>
<p>And a lot more people making $50,000-plus-a-year have money they can afford to lose than those making less than $25,000 p.a.  Which is what the data shows.</p>

<p>This second one is just plain funny (at least to me).  It spoofs on the Annie Oakley comment by Senator Obama.</p>
<p>On the economy side of things using my GFP (gross flower production), things were not as good as last year.  What started off as a year with a bang, is now looking to be equal to last years numbers.  We were up 21% end of March.  End of April we were up 4.7%. As of Mother&#8217;s Day, 2.6% on the year.  Interestingly, looking at credit card use for the holiday months Valentines was up 23%, Easter was up 13% and now Mother&#8217;s Day is down 27%.  This is the shift I saw starting last August.  But, cash sales are up for May 33%.  They were up for January and February, but cash sales were down both March and April.</p>

                                <p>Hat tip to reader Henry Cobb.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economist.com/daily/columns/marketview/displaystory.cfm?story_id=11355750">The Economist</a> reports an intersting conclusion in how we measure the equation more growth=more profits for investors.<br />
<blockquote>None of this is to deny the importance of emerging economies. The booms in India and China will have enormous effects on everything from the wages of unskilled labour to the price of commodities. But the simple equation that more growth equals more profits for investors is simply not borne out by history.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>FASTER economic growth means higher returns for investors. That is a big part of the rationale for investing in emerging markets.</p>
<p>The problem with this argument is that it is not true. Research by the London Business School looked at 17 countries over 108 years. The countries with the slowest-growing economies (as measured by GDP growth over five-year periods) returned 8% a year; the markets in the fastest-growing economies, by contrast, returned just 5% a year.</p>
<p>When a broader group of 53 economies, including many emerging markets, were examined, the tortoises beat the hares by a wider margin—12% to 6-7%. James Montier of Société Générale found that the slowest-growing emerging markets have delivered higher returns than the fastest growers over the past 20 years.</p>
<p>An earlier study by Jay Ritter of the University of Florida tried to explain a key LBS finding—a negative correlation between real stock returns and real per capita GDP growth over more than a century. Why should this be?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Mr Ritter points out that an economy can grow quickly by applying more capital and more labour, in which case owners of capital will not earn higher returns. What matters for stock returns, he says, is how much of an economy&#8217;s growth comes from the reinvestment of earnings into investments with net positive value in publicly traded companies.</p>
<p>But in emerging markets a lot of wealth is being created in private unquoted companies (or, in some cases, by companies owned by the government). In neither case do investors in existing quoted companies benefit.</p>
<p>Investors also need to be wary of the argument that, as emerging economies become more important in global GDP, so emerging markets will take a bigger weight in global stockmarket capitalisation. This may be true, but much depends on how the emerging markets become more important.</p>
<p>One way is for share prices to rise; another is for more shares to be issued. In the latter case, existing investors are simply getting a smaller share of a bigger pie. Société Générale found this “dilution effect” worked out at 2% per year in developed markets, but a staggering 13% per annum in emerging ones.</p>
<p>Worse still, the expectation that higher growth will lead to higher returns actually works against the investor. That is because markets assign a high price-earnings ratio (and low dividend-yield) to countries and companies where future growth is expected to be strong. But there is a negative correlation between high valuations and future returns.</p>
<p>That may create a particular problem for those investing in emerging markets at the moment. According to Mr Montier, emerging markets are trading on a trailing price-earnings ratio of 22 and a price-to-book ratio of more than 3, both substantial premia to developed markets.</p>
<p>On a cyclically-adjusted p/e basis (averaging the earnings over 10 years), emerging markets are trading on a multiple of 40, close to their highest ever and around the level that developed markets achieved at the height of the dotcom bubble. They are also trading around two standard deviations over their trend level, a measure that marked out previous bubbles such as Japan in the 1980s.</p></blockquote>
<p>And how do hedge funds fit in as money makes money?</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hks.harvard.edu/jeffreyliebman/lms_nonpartisan_plan_description.pdf">LMS: the Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick Non-Partisan Social Security Reform Plan</a>. <br />Above we see Tables 1 &#038; 2 of LMS. Its authors are interesting for a couple of reasons. One they are connected at pretty high policy levels to Administrations past, current, and future. In their own self description from LMS:<br /> &#8220;The three of us – former aides to President Clinton, Senator McCain, and President Bush – did an experiment to see if we could develop a reform plan that we could all support.  The Liebman-MacGuineas-Samwick (LMS) plan demonstrates the types of compromises that can help policy makers from across the political spectrum agree on a Social Security reform plan.&#8221; <br />Which is well and good except that in this case &#8216;spectrum&#8217; seems to span everything from (barely) left-center to right. This is bipartisan in the Lieberman sense, lets agree to slightly moderate a conservative position and call it good. Second coming of FDR it decidedly isn&#8217;t. But back to the authors. Prof Jeffrey Liebman (of Harvard&#8217;s Kennedy School of Government) is particularly interesting in that as well as being a former Clintonista he is currently one of the top three economists on Obama&#8217;s economic team. When Social Security policy is being discussed in what I hope is an Obama Administration he is more than likely to be sitting at the table, something I view with a certain unease. And then there is Professor Andrew Samwick who around the time this plan was being drafted was Chief Staff Economist at the Bush Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), now and then a Professor of Economics at Dartmouth as well as maintaining an active blog presence through his old blog VoxBaby and his new one Capital Gains and Games. He is highly regarded by the Econobloggers generally as being an &#8216;Honest Conservative&#8217; and has his stuff crossposted at EV, DeLong, and here. He is a nice guy but one with policy views on Social Security that are in my view profoundly worker unfriendly. Which is the topic of this post. I gave Prof. Samwick a heads up about this post and an open invitation to comment. Hopefully he will.</p>
<p>Why worker unfriendly? Discussion below the fold.</p>
<p>Lets start with Table 1. It is a matrix with twelve cells in four columns. The first column is kind of confusing, it represents a rather odd intermediate stage of LMS so we can put it aside for now and examine the three end state situations. As those who have followed this series along will remember, under the 2008 Intermediate Cost alternative Social Security is projected to return 78% of the scheduled benefit at Trust Fund depletion. This figure is up fairly significantly from the 2004-2005 timeframe in which LMS was drafted, a fact that justs adds more difficulty to their argument. If we examine the other nine cells we see a curious feature of this &#8216;reform&#8217;, in four out of nine cases it does not supply a 100% result. If you subtract out &#8216;Two earner widowed&#8217; that drops to four out of six with a fifth at 101.6% being rather marginal. Which means that for whatever positive policy goals come out of LMS it is not exactly a &#8216;fix&#8217; from the perspective of most workers. Indeed for the low income one earner it is barely a partial fix, closing as it does only a third of the gap.</p>
<p>But something is better than nothing isn&#8217;t it? Hmm, not necessarily. Let&#8217;s take a look at Table 2 and figure out what that &#8216;Something&#8217; will cost. First we should point out that LMS proposes a 1.5% across the board increase in payroll tax in addition to the figures shown in Table 2. That 1.5% doesn&#8217;t show up because the funds never hit the Trust Fund, instead they are placed in a PRA, a Personal Retirement Account, Table 2 in contrast represents the scored results of LMS on the Trust Fund itself as scored by the SSA Office of the Chief Actuary. So the total cost of LMS breaks down as follows:</p>
<p>1.5% payroll tax increase across the board<br />1.0% payroll equivalent by lifting the payroll cap to 90% of wage income<br />.06% payroll equivalent by raising early and full retirement age<br />2.08% payroll equivalent by changing the benefit formula (i.e. benefit cuts)</p>
<p>Add it all together and workers are expected to take a cumulative and collective 5.2% hit. And in most cases don&#8217;t actually get a 100% fix. In the face of a payroll gap that at the time LMS was drafted was 1.92% and is now 1.7%. Note particularly that simply taking the 1.5% payroll tax increase would have backfilled around 75% of the then projected gap (taking 1.92% to .42%) and now would backfill 88% of the 2008 payroll gap (taking 1.7% to 0.2%) which by my calculation gives a 97% benefit relative to the current schedule. With no changes in retirement age.</p>
<p>So the question for discussion is why workers would take a deal that requires workers making under the cap to take a 4.2% hit {corrected from 4.7%} to solve a 1.7% problem? And why we should make tax increases on the wealthy so much more out of reach by imposing a steep 6.2% increase on wages between $102,000 and $160,000 (noting that the cap increase is itself capped under LMS and still doesn&#8217;t reach to gains on capital)? LMS lays out some positive policy outcomes if Congress actually responds as the plan suggests, but those outcomes benefit the entire country and notably capital. Why oh why do we have to pay for these goals totally out of wage income?</p>
<p>Well excellent questions in context. Which is why they changed the context. In 2003 the Social Security Report suddenly introduced a new wrinkle. Instead of simply projecting solvency in terms of Short Term Actuarial Balance (1 year of projected reserves in each of the next 10 years) and Long Term Actuarial Balance (1 year of reserves in each of the next 75 years) they decided we needed to measure solvency across the Infinite Future Horizon. The utility of this measure has been explained in two general ways. One it is not fair for someone in the workforce to be told the system is solvent if you are just going to pull the rug out in year 76. Well okay, but vanishingly small portions of the current workforce are going to be around at that point, even our youngest workers would be in their late nineties and we could capture even them with a five or ten year expansion of the window. Why take it out to heat death of the sun? If the 2082 date was fixed this approach would make sense, but the 75 year window is adjusted each year to include the next year, it is a rolling number. To put it bluntly the argument that Infinite Future is required for current retirement planning is just nonsense. The second explanation is to say that it is all about inter-generational fairness. Which might be reasonable if any of these plans included some effort to close the spending gap on the General Fund side. But no forcing future generations to pay for military weaponry that by their time had been on the scrap heap for decades? Alrighty then. Asking them to fund their own retirements? Oh the horrors.</p>
<p>There is only one logical explanation for Infinite Future. It allows for scarier numbers by adding $10 trillion to Unfunded Liability and almost doubling the payroll gap. It was a lot easier to defend LMS when you could cite (generally without qualification) a payroll gap of 3.7% as opposed to 1.92% (2008: 3.2% vs 1.7%). It kind of buffered that 5.2% to 1.92% equation. But to me it smacks of fairly sneaky bait and switch to sell a plan that on the numbers is profoundly anti-worker.</p>

                                <p>Again we are getting the right wing line that the windfall profits tax on oil in the 1980s caused<br />oil production to fall and oil imports to rise  as Carpe Diem at  http://www.blogger.com/post-create.g?blogID=5048766.</p>
<p>post a story from Investors Business Daily saying that from 1980 to 1986 oil production fell.</p>
<p>Yes, the windfall profits tax was still on the books in 1986, but the tax was only paid when the price of oil was above $30/ B and the last time that happened was in September 1983.  So by claiming a tax was effective three years after it became ineffective they are able to make that claim.</p>
<p>I am still waiting for one of these right wing advocates to reply to my question that if their economic philosophy is so good and superior why do they have to be so dishonest in defending it.</p>
<p>If their claims are correct, shouldn&#8217;t the truth be an adequate defense?<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SChlWqtg35I/AAAAAAAAAPg/ObYlTrhLdnI/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SChlWqtg35I/AAAAAAAAAPg/ObYlTrhLdnI/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SChlgKtg36I/AAAAAAAAAPo/QKqF95rZg5M/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SChlgKtg36I/AAAAAAAAAPo/QKqF95rZg5M/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SChlqKtg37I/AAAAAAAAAPw/Fd-r5iMysUw/s1600-h/Clipboard04.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SChlqKtg37I/AAAAAAAAAPw/Fd-r5iMysUw/s320/Clipboard04.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>

<blockquote>The only way speculation can have a persistent effect on oil prices, then, is if it leads to physical hoarding — an increase in private inventories of black gunk.

<p>But it hasn’t happened this time: all through the period of the alleged bubble, inventories have remained at more or less normal levels. This tells us that the rise in oil prices isn’t the result of runaway speculation; it’s the result of fundamental factors, mainly the growing difficulty of finding oil and the rapid growth of emerging economies like China. The rise in oil prices these past few years had to happen to keep demand growth from exceeding supply growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Twilight in the Desert, Simmons asserted the obvious: Oil is a non-renewable resource. The age of oil will end.  The question is when.  Because of the importance of oil to the global economy, Simmons asked that OPEC, particularly Saudi Arabia, open its oil books: What are the facts concerning the great oil fields in the desert? Have they peaked or are they close to peaking? How much time do we have?</p>
<p>Or has the demand for oil&#8211;particularly from emerging economies like China&#8211;meant that production is barely keeping pace with demand? How long can this continue before the price of oil moves even higher.</p>
<p>None of these questions have been answered. Production capacity remains a state secret, despite the fact that George Bush, hat in hand, has asked the Saudis to increase production, not much has happened.</p>
<p>Certainly, the actual cost of production has risen. Even the tar sands looks increasingly expensive&#8211;and we have yet to factor in fully the environmental cost. That we even need to tap the tar sands should tell us something. Or that we now talk about Montana shale should tell us more. Windmill farms are becoming increasingly popular. Windmills are on the move, quite literally. The roofs of some European countries are now studded with solar panels.</p>
<p>China, however, is the place to watch&#8230;not the U.S. The great dragon is thirsty. According to a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&#038;sid=a_YCEx7do3LQ&#038;refer=home">Bloomberg article</a>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>Economic growth of more than 8 percent in China and India, coupled with increasing car ownership among the countries&#8217; combined populations of 2.45 billion people, will more than compensate for falling U.S. demand. Oil use worldwide will increase 2 percent this year because of growth in emerging markets, the Paris-based IEA says.</p>
<p>Has the U.S. mattered for the last few years? It is debatable. As far as the oil market is concerned, demand growth is going to be continued to be driven by China and the Middle East. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>And note the difference in per capita consumption&#8211;and these are 2005 numbers:</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>China consumed 5 barrels of oil/per day for every 1000 people </li>
<li>America consumed 70 barrels of oil per day for every 1000 people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Imagine China consuming 70 barrels of oil per day for every 1000 people. Where will the oil be found and at what price?</p>
<p>In discussing China&#8217;s blueprint for rapid industrialization, I have always been fond of saying that China simply will not meet its goal of becoming a frontier nation by 2100: No white picket fences and two-car garages for China.</p>
<p>Instead of moving rapidly towards 21st century technology, China foolishly laid its plans based on conventional sources of energy: coal and oil. And, we, of course, continued to pick our noses while driving SUV&#8217;s. The only hope for China, India, and the rest of us is that we can tap vast quantities of alternative and renewable sources of energy&#8230;soon.</p>
<p>Car pool if you want&#8211;or ride the aging transit system. Demand destruction in the West may not mean much. The question is: What will it mean for China? Meanwhile, crunch time approaches.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/world/middleeast/12basra.html?th&#038;emc=th">The NYT</a> reports significant progress in Basra, Iraq.</p>
<blockquote><p>The principal factor for improvement that people in Basra cite is the deployment of 33,000 members of the Iraqi security forces after the March 24 start of operations, which allowed the government to blanket the city with checkpoints on every major intersection and highway.</p>
<p>Borrowing tactics from the troop increase in Baghdad, the Iraqi forces raided militia strongholds and arrested hundreds of suspects. They also seized weapons including mortars, rocket-propelled grenades and sophisticated roadside bombs that officials say were used by Iranian-backed groups responsible for much of the violence.</p>
<p>Government forces have now taken over Islamic militants’ headquarters and halted the death squads and “vice ‘enforcers’ ” who attacked women, Christians, musicians, alcohol sellers and anyone suspected of collaborating with Westerners.</p></blockquote>
<p>Without doubt much of the active shooting and the religious persecution ending is a great relief to most citizens. The last time I mentioned Basra was in relation to the gun battles over the municiple position of the director of public works in the city, in particular electricity distribution. Deciding who provides services by gunpoint has got to be bad for ordinary folk.</p>
<p>Deep in the current report comes a quote from the General of Iraqi forces in Basra:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gen. Mohan al-Freiji, the Iraqi commander in Basra, said the city was “75 percent” under control. He said the principal threat stemmed from rogue elements of the Mahdi Army and factions like the Iraqi Hezbollah (Party of God), Thairallah (Revenge of God) and Fadhila (Virtue).</p></blockquote>
<p>I was somewhat confused because the fight over electriciy was said to be between the Mahdi Army and Fadhila army, so I assumed the Fadhila army was the main rival to Mahdi. Where did they go in the news?</p>
<p>The rogue part might very well be true, and I would not know how a reporter could confirm the allegation. Basra appeared to have blocks of fighters unable to consolidate their positions against opponents, and the harshness of the religious enforcement of this brand of Islam horrifying to my sensibilities.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/angrybear.blogspot.com/2007_08_19_angrybear_archive.html">My 2007 post&#8217;s source</a> described this scenario:</p>
<blockquote><p>The concrete walls that surround the Fadhila party&#8217;s compound in Sharish, north of Basra city centre, resemble the barricades around the fortified Green Zone in Baghdad.</p>
<p>Last spring, fierce clashes erupted between Fadhila and the Mahdi Army, a paramilitary group loyal to radical Shia cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Several people were killed on both sides and offices and buildings belonging to the two parties were destroyed.</p>
<p>Mediators from tribes and other political parties managed to end the fighting but as Abu Ali al-Baaj, a mid-level Mahdi Army commander, put it, &#8220;The tensions were not buried for good.”</p>
<p>The reason for the battle was simple &#8211; as the governing party in Basra, Fadhila had replaced the head of the local electricity department, who happened to be a Sadr supporter.</p>
<p>Behind the façade of democratic institutions such as councils and the police force, Iraq’s second-largest city with about 2.6 million inhabitants, has fallen into the grip of competing militias who are as suspicious of one another as rival mafia families.</p>
<p>When the two militias began fighting over the post of electricity chief, the police force divided into factions which turned their weapons on one another. Police cars were used to transport militia members.</p>
<p>The Fadhila party runs the provincial council of Basra and controls most of the government institutions there. It was founded after Saddam Hussein&#8217;s regime was toppled in April 2003, and holds 15 seats in the Iraqi parliament. With leading Shia cleric Sheikh Mohammed al-Yaqubi as its spiritual leader, the party also features Basra’s governor Mohammed al-Waili among its leading members.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now tell me again how my posts shut the loyal opposition out, when the heavy lifting is also done here? If Basra has been going better and improving things, where was the hat tip to post over the last several weeks?</p>
<p>Update: The point being is where did the Fadhila group, king of the hill, go in the MSM and rhetoric of the fight for Basra?  <br />Update 2:<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/basra-force-ratios.html">Here</a> is another post with link.</p>

<p>Stephen Moore Looks at Mississippi</p>
<p>The <a title="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?la+28" href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?la+28">seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Mississippi</a> in January of 2004, the month Haley Barbour became governor of the state, was 5.7%. A year later, it was 6.9%. The latest figures (March 2003) showed a seasonally adjusted figure of 6.0%. Now consider the following sentence:<br />
<blockquote>Thanks to Mr. Barbour, the state&#8217;s unemployment rate is down to about 6% from nearly 9%. </p></blockquote>
<p>Given the facts, would you be embarrassed to write that sentence? I imagine most people would. Let&#8217;s look at at a few more facts. This <a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/spi/spi_newsrelease.htm">BEA<br />news release</a> provides a list of the states with the fastest and slowest per capita income growth rates from 2006 to 2007. The top three are:1. Louisiana, growth rate = 9.2%2. New York, growth rate = 7.6%3. Mississippi, growth rate = 6.7%Most people would look at this and and suspect that a certain August 2005 event might have something to do with the growth rate in Louisiana and Mississippi. Rebuilding after a devastating hurricane will lead to rapid growth in per capita income. Thus, most people would not think to write this:<br />
<blockquote>Last year, Mississippi&#8217;s per capita income growth was 6.7%, third highest of the 50 states and well above the national average of 5.2%. Mississippi tort reform is making the poor richer, and the rich lawyers less fabulously rich.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most people would have avoided writing this article. Kudos to Stephen Moore, senior economics writer for The Wall Street Journal editorial page, who most definitely is not most people.</p>
