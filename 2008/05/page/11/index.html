<p>Then again, he is also well aware that, were Hillary to drop out today, it wouldn&#8217;t be all peaches and cream from now until after the nominations are in place.<br />
<blockquote>People are saying that Hillary is &#8220;race-baiting&#8221; because she mentioned &#8220;blue-collar whites.&#8221; Save the racist accusations for what&#8217;s coming &#8212; because it surely IS coming&#8230;.</p>
<p>It is the old way, and it worked for a long time, and it stopped working and the 50-state strategy is what we need now. But is isn&#8217;t racist and isn&#8217;t intended to divide us. Is going after &#8220;soccer moms&#8221; or &#8220;NASCAR dads&#8221; as a demographic voting block a sexist tactic? Yes and no, but it isn&#8217;t intended to divide. She is just saying that voting patterns show that she is bringing in more of certain groups &#8212; and confirming her unfortunate entrenchment in the old-style &#8220;big state&#8221; view.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about real racism. Look at what has already started from the right. We already have seen them using &#8220;boy&#8221; and &#8220;darkest Africa.&#8221; As November approaches you will be hearing about &#8220;our women.&#8221; There will be stuff about how Obama wants the While House so he can lure in white wives of important Senators, etc. There will be a lot of &#8220;us&#8221; vs &#8220;them.&#8221; And much, much worse. Believe me, much, MUCH worse. THAT is when you want to talk about people using racism as a campaign tactic. And when that happens you really don&#8217;t want the right saying &#8220;well that&#8217;s what you said about Hillary, too.&#8221; [boldface and italics his]</p></blockquote>
<p>As I noted at <a href="http://www.thomaspalley.com/">Thomas Palley&#8217;s blog</a> a few days ago, &#8220;If Obama can’t take punches from the HRC campaign, he’s got no chance of doing so against the professionals of Ari Fleis[c]her and the RNC.&#8221;  And while many <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/295/results-la-special-election-are-big-deal">appear to believe that the Dems could run anyone with a personality this side of Harry Reid</a> after eight years of Bush-league rule, it&#8217;s a long way to November.  And the more Hillary-punches Obama can take, the better off he&#8217;ll be when the real goons, not just <a href="http://belowthebeltway.com/2008/04/01/hillary-rocky-balboa-clinton/">Rocky Balboa</a>, start swinging.</p>

<p>no one ought to try to live on SS who isn&#8217;t already pretty good at living on nothing. </p>
<p>but that&#8217;s pretty much the point: SS is insurance&#8230; you set aside the least amount of money you can in order to guarantee at least the lowest possible standard of living you can stand &#8220;if all else fails.&#8221;</p>
<p>and it turns out that for a lot of people who never thought it would happen to them, all else does fail.</p>
<p>as for the greater returns from equities etc. yep. </p>
<p>that&#8217;s the risk premium. i encourage people to invest and not rely on SS. but keep that old SS anyway. Just in case.</p>
<p>And I am still not sure that a &#8220;no SS, EVERYONE invested in the stock market&#8221; could work as well as &#8220;every worker has SS, those who can afford the risk invest in stocks.&#8221; this has something to do with the fallacy of composition. is there really some place to put all that money that will generate real &#8220;growth&#8221; or will future profits on your investments come out of lower wages and higher prices&#8230;?</p>
<p>By the way, I never missed my SS &#8220;tax.&#8221; I think you have to be a specially ..uh..money oriented kind of person to notice the payroll tax.. or to have been whipped up into hysteria by people claiming it is being stolen from you.</p></blockquote>

<p>Vtcodger says:</p>
<blockquote><p>1. Social Security is adequate only if you plan to spend your golden years in a poorly heated hovel dining on macaroni and cheese. I&#8217;d be OK with that myself, but a lot of folks wouldn&#8217;t. Most people need additional savings. That&#8217;s where 401K, IRA, et al come in.</p>
<p>2. Some advocates of privatization are not motivated by ideology or greed. They perceive that there will be better long term returns from stocks than from treasury bills &#8212; which is basically where any investment component of SS is stashed. (more below).</p>
<p>3. Countries that have privatized retirement (Chile, the UK) may not be doing all that well with it. Transaction costs and administrative fees are said to be disturbingly high. It&#8217;s not clear that their plans won&#8217;t eventually require a massive government bail out.==</p>
<p>Equities (stocks) do indeed seem to have a better long term return than bonds. At least US stocks do. And that&#8217;s true even if you substantially discount current US equity prices which seem to be rather high and to be based on dubious earnings reports. I&#8217;ll skip the numbers because everyone&#8217;s numbers are different, but the difference does appear to be significant. A couple of percentage points. Which is a lot of money compounded over a lifetime of savings. </p>
<p>Two points:</p>
<p>T1. There was a discussion over at Brad DeLong&#8217;s blog a number of months ago about whether countries other than the US have a similar differential long term in stock and bond yields. The conclusions was &#8212; quite possibly not &#8212; at least not all of them. That is to say that &#8220;Equities have better long term yields than stocks&#8221; may not be a universal law. If it isn&#8217;t, then how do we know that privatized retirement won&#8217;t yield worse results than the current plan?</p>
<p>2. Although overall returns from stocks in the US have been excellent, there have been long dry spells. The assertion that there has been no decade where stocks haven&#8217;t made money is simply wrong &#8212; at least in inflation adjusted terms. My concern is whether a privatized retirement system could weather two decades like 1965-1985 where the real return on equities netted out to about zero.</p>

                                <p>Reader Andrew sent this link on statistics and climate modeling:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.stats.org/stories/2008/can_trust_climate_models_apr23_08.html">Can we trust climate models</a> makes a stab at figuring out what is valuable with the models and what is not. It also points out the fact the the commonality in models of the impact of &#8220;greenhouse&#8221; gases, and why these appear important.</p>
<p>Perhaps an AB or reader could devlop a post on models. It is interesting to read.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/251/story/36530.html">McClatchy Washington Bureau</a> reports a possible agreement between the militias, and with the Iraqi government:</p>
<blockquote><p>Followers of rebel cleric Muqtada al Sadr agreed late Friday to allow Iraqi security forces to enter all of Baghdad&#8217;s Sadr City and to arrest anyone found with heavy weapons in a surprising capitulation that seemed likely to be hailed as a major victory for Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki.<br />In return, Sadr&#8217;s Mahdi Army supporters won the Iraqi government&#8217;s agreement not to arrest Mahdi Army members without warrants, unless they were in possession of &#8220;medium and heavy weaponry.&#8221;</p>
<p>The agreement would end six weeks of fighting in the vast Shiite Muslim area that&#8217;s home to more than 2 million residents and would mark the first time that the area would be under government control since Saddam Hussein was toppled in 2003. On Friday, 15 people were killed and 112 were injured in fighting, officials at the neighborhoods two major hospitals said.</p>
<p>&#8230;..</p>
<p>Members of Maliki&#8217;s Dawa Party and the powerful Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq met with Sadr officials on Thursday and Friday to come up with a 14-point agreement to end the weeks of fighting, which has hindered the flow of food and water into Sadr City. The agreement was then passed to Sadr and Maliki for final approval, said Baha al Araji, a Sadrist legislator.</p>
<p>Hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds have been wounded in the fighting, which included frequent U.S. airstrikes. At least 8,500 people have been driven from their homes, and thousands of others have been forced to stay inside, too frightened to flee.</p>
<p>&#8230;.</p>
<p>Sadr supporter Araji, however, said the agreement specifically barred American forces from entering Sadr City.</p></blockquote>
<p>The agreement probably will not be released for awhile as appears to happen most often. But the jockying of military and political forces in a &#8216;soft&#8217; sort of skirmish campaign will probably be the order of the day if all are lucky.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Cosi made some excellent analysis of the budget implications in the last comment thread, then raised only to drop the issue of motive for privatizers. So I want to try a crack at it here.</p>
<p>It is clear to me that most of the people who are pushing privatization are fundamentally opposed to Social Democratic solutions generally. There is a large group of people who never liked the New Deal, continue to argue against historical evidence that it was a fundamental failure, they hated Social Security from the start, and indeed ran against it as their central platform plank in the election of 1936. They expected it would fail, they see the various rounds of tax increases over the years as proof that it will fail. The 1983 reform was particularly bitter to them, to the point that they gathered all the anti-Social Security folk to a conference in DC organized by Cato. The results of that conference were published in the Fall 1983 issue of Cato Journal under the title <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2.html">Social Security: Continuing Crisis or Real Reform</a> but which might as well been called &#8220;Never again! We&#8217;ll get you next time FDR!&#8221;</p>
<p>You can get a flavor of this by reading through the introduction. There is zero interest expressed in the idea that worker retirement be in any sense a social responsibility long term, instead Social Security is described entirely in terms of diluting investment and retirement planning and of increasing the ratio of labor costs to capital. Most telling is point 2 of their 8 point conclusion:<br />&#8220;2. Social Security is ultimately a manifestation of the welfare state. Real reform, therefore, may require constitutional change that effectively limits the taxing and spending powers of government.&#8221;<br />The Cato types see it as welfare, they disagree with government welfare programs in general, and would like to see all of them vanish over time. To use the words of Newt Gingrich to see them &#8220;wither on the vine&#8221;</p>
<p>Now in reading this from 1983 you can see that these people, while a little bitter at missing their shot in 1982 when Social Security crisis hit, were convinced they would get another shot at some point. But they also saw they needed more than hope. They needed an alternative vehicle and they needed a plan. They had the alternative vehicle, the IRA-the Individual Retirement Account, and they got busy pushing those. But they also understood they needed to win the message war, and so they turned to strategy crafted by Stuart Germanis and Peter Butler. The answer to the question posed in the post is under the fold.</p>
<p> On the title page of the journal the article title was softened somewhat by prefacing it with &#8216;Social Security Reform: but the article itself&#8217;s title page was more blunt <a href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj3n2/cj3n2-11.pdf">Achieving a &#8220;Leninist&#8221; Strategy</a>. While they had the minimal grace to put Leninist in scare quotes a reading of the whole article revels that they meant it. At a certain risk to free use doctrine I am going to quote at some length.<br />
<blockquote>Marx believed that capitalism was doomed by its inherent contradictions, and that it would inevitably collapse—to he replaced by the next stage on the ladder leading to the socialist Utopia. <br />Lenin also believed that capitalism was doomed by its inherent contradictions, and would inevitably collapse. But just to be on the safe side, he sought to mobilize the working class, in alliance with other key elements in political society, both to hasten the collapse and to ensure that the result conformed with his interpretation of the proletarian state. Unlike many other socialists at the time, Lenin recognized that fundamental change is contingent both upon a movement’s ability to create a focused political coalition and upon its success in isolating and weakening its opponents. </p>
<p>As we contemplate basic reform of the Social Security system, we would do well to draw a few lessons from the Leninist strategy. Many critics of the present system believe, as Marx and Lenin did of capitalism, that the system’s days are numbered because of its contra dictory objectives of attempting to provide both welfare and insureance. All that really needs to be done, they contend, is to point out these inherent flaws to the taxpayers and to show them that Social Security would be vastly improved if it were restructured into a predominantly private system. Convinced by the undeniable facts <br />and logic, individuals supposedly would then rise up and demand that their representatives make the appropriate reforms. </p>
<p>While this may indeed happen, the public’s reaction last year against politicians who simply noted the deep problems of the system, and the absence of even a recognition of the underlying problems during this spring’s Social Security “reform,” suggest that it will be a long time before citizen indignation will cause radical change to take place. Therefore, if we are to achieve basic changes in the system, we must first prepare the political ground so that the <br />fiasco of the last 18 months is not repeated. </p></blockquote>
<p>1. Create a political movement<br />2. Weaken and isolate your opponents<br />3. Prepare the public ground<br />Oh and make it clear that the 1983 Reform was in fact from your perspective a &#8220;fiasco&#8221;</p>
<p>I would urge anyone really interested in Social Security to read the plan in full. Because you will see that the Economic Right followed it to the hilt, for example you hear clear echoes of Butler and Germanis in every speech Bush has made on this. I am not sure that everyone that draws from the messaging plan created at that 1983 conference is as directly and openly cynical about means and motives as these two. Operationally it doesn&#8217;t matter much. Butler and Germanis&#8217; is a hugely successful marketing scheme and it worked. Brilliantly. The old were reassured, the economic stakeholders were drawn on board, the young were convinced that Social Security just wouldn&#8217;t be there for them, and all blame conveniently placed on the Boomers. Evil genius to be sure, but marketing genius none the less.</p>

                                <blockquote><p>Some readers resented The Washington Post for publishing an Associated Press photograph of a critically wounded Iraqi child being lifted from the rubble of his home in Baghdad’s Sadr City “after a U.S. airstrike.”</p>
<p>Two-year-old Ali Hussein later died in a hospital.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, the picture was worth a thousand words because it showed the true horrors of this war.  </p>
<p>Neither side is immune from the killing of Iraqi civilians. But Americans should be aware of their own responsibility for inflicting death and pain on the innocent.</p>
<p>The Post’s ombudsman, Deborah Howell, said about 20 readers complained about the photo, while a few readers praised the Post for publishing the stark picture on page one.</p>
<p>Some mothers said they were offended that their children might see the picture, though one wonders whether their youngsters watch television and play with violent videos in a pretend world.</p>
<p>From the start of the unprovoked U.S. “shock and awe” invasion of Iraq on March 20, 2003, the government tried to bar the news media from photographing flag-draped coffins of American soldiers returning from Iraq. A Freedom of Information lawsuit forced the government to release pictures of returning coffins.</p>
<p>Howell said some readers felt the photo of the Iraqi boy was “an anti-war statement; some thought it was in poor taste.” Well, so is war.</p>
<p>Howell said her boss, Executive Editor Len Downie, “is cautious about such photos.”</p>
<p>“We have seldom been able to show the human impact of the fighting on Iraqis,” Downie was quoted as saying. “We decided this was a rare instance in which we had a powerful image with which to do so.”</p>
<p>It’s unclear to me why this was deemed to be “rare.” After five years of war, there is finally one photo that is supposed to say it all?</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a cost to staying disconnected from acknowledging and even embracing pain and one&#8217;s role in the causing of it.  We are paying that price as a people and a nation.</p>
<p>In Fanueil Hall in Boston is a mural depicting the signing of the Declaration of Independence, where all the signers gathered in concert to free our country from tryanny.  John Adams late in his life (he lived to 90), who lived in Braintree, upon seeing it, said we have lost the history of our nation already.</p>
<p>To speak of these things on a regular basis is not something I see as pessimisism and brooding, or denial of my success in life and the blessings I have.  The pain in life happens, and cannot be denied in the long run, actually. Allow it to numb you and you lose the happiness as well.</p>

                                <p>Both would benefit from a higher inflation index than CPI.  AEI hack (and former Social Security Administration commissioner!) Andrew Biggs redefines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_drag#Bracket_creep">bracket creep</a> (*) for the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121029420845179505.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">W$J op-ed page</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Tax revenues would skyrocket if the tax cuts expire, due to &#8220;bracket creep.&#8221; Average incomes are higher today than in the 1990s, but income-tax brackets aren&#8217;t adjusted for the growth of earnings. As a result, Americans will shift into higher tax brackets and pay a greater share of their incomes in taxes. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/05/coming-tax-hike.html">Greg Mankiw</a>, who for inscrutable reasons calls this &#8220;reporting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, tax brackets (with the notable exception of those of the Alternative Minimum Tax) now are indexed for growth in prices, at least to the extent that&#8217;s measured by CPI.  Really, this is part of a broader attack on progressive taxation, as you can see from an <a href="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.12064/pub_detail.asp">earlier effort along these lines</a> by AEI über-hack Kevin Hassett of Dow 36,000 fame.  Though I suppose there may be some positive side effects for society if the AEI&#8217;s paymasters had to allow enough trickle-down to keep average wage growth ahead of CPI.</p>
