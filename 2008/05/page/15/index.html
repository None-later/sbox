<p><a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/296/fixed-investment-picture">Andrew Samwick</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>That we are not in a recession, based on weak GDP growth and a host of other macroeconomic indicators that have been flat since last summer, is quite remarkable &#8230; Note that the fall in residential investment has been just as large and even steeper than the decline in equipment and software investment that was the driver of the last recession. Equipment and software investment fell to and has hovered around the share of GDP that it was in 1993.  Residential investment has fallen to that level.  It&#8217;s not clear when the fall will stop.</p></blockquote>
<p>Our graph shows total fixed investment as a share of GDP as well as its components including residential investment, investment in equipment and software, and investment in non-residential structures. Total fixed investment boomed in the 1990’s but collapsed from 2001 to early 2003 when it bottomed out at 14.8% of GDP.  By 2006QI, it had recovered to 16.8% of GDP by 2006QI.  Last quarter, however, it had fallen to less than 14.5% of GDP.  </p>
<p>During the investment collapsed from 2001 to 2003, the residential investment boom partially offset the collapse or investment in equipment and software.  Investment in equipment and software is still weak and residential investment has itself collapsed.   It would seem that the alleged Bush investment boom never exactly got roaring and now is sort of dead. But you’d never know this if you listened to <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDM0OGU3Nzk0MTMyMGI3NTU1Y2JmYWVhOWU3OTU4ZGQ=">this clown</a>.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24465000">AP</a> reports that President Bush argues that there is no quick fix for the problem of high gasoline prices:</p>
<blockquote><p>President Bush said Monday that he&#8217;s troubled by rising gas prices and will take a look at proposals to relieve the crisis but warned that there is no quick fix.  &#8220;It&#8217;s been a while in the making and it&#8217;s going to be a while that we solve the problem,&#8221; Bush said in an interview on ABC&#8217;s &#8220;Good Morning America.&#8221; &#8220;We&#8217;re too dependent on foreign oil and we need to be exploring more at home.&#8221; Bush said the rising cost of gas &#8220;troubles me a lot&#8221; because it is &#8220;like a tax on the working people.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This leaves me wondering why Bush has not jumped on the McCain-Clinton gas tax holiday bandwagon – but hopefully he’ll resist such pandering THIS TIME.  AP mentions that proposal as well as the windfall profits tax – which I bet Bush will not consider.  AP also mentions a few that I’m sure Bush is itching to push forward:</p>
<blockquote><p>new refineries, nuclear power plants and drilling in the Alaska wilderness, supported by Bush. &#8220;We&#8217;ll analyze some of these suggestions, but the key is that we think long-term for America, that we diversify away from oil and we&#8217;re wise and build new refineries and increase supply for the American consumers,&#8221; Bush said in the interview on the White House grounds with his wife, Laura.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did I say I was wondering if Bush might consider the McCain-Clinton quick fix and perhaps a few of his own? </p>
<blockquote><p>The federal tax rebate on the way to taxpayers will help, he said. &#8220;One way to help solve it, of course, is by sending some of the money back. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s happening now as we speak. There&#8217;s a rebate going back to the American people, which should help,&#8221; Bush said. He reiterated his call for Congress to make permanent the tax cuts enacted during his administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep – it’s time for some more Spend&#038;Spend and Borrow&#038;Borrow!  What do we tell the children?</p>

                                <p>A lot of ink is being spilled over the inventory numbers in the gdp report.</p>
<p>So I though I would just post on one of the available monthly data series on inventories.<br />This shows that the real I/S ratio fell sharply in March.  But the gdp report includes no<br />data on March inventories.  This implies that the next revision of real GDP will be down,<br />but that there is little reason to expect a rebuilding of inventories in the future to boost growth.<br />It is part of the great moderation that in todays world firms do not allow inventories to get way out of line and this sharply reduces the odds of a recession.  We could still have a recession, but it<br />will not be a classic inventory cycle.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Title: Would Oil Suppliers keep a &#8220;gas tax holiday&#8221; as profit?</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some real numbers. The following table is excepted from Exxon-Mobil (as a proxy for Oil Supplier) financial statements 2003-2007.</p>
<p>                  2003     2004     2005     2006      2007</p>
<p>Revenue          $246.7B  $291.3    $370.7   $377.6    $404.6 </p>
<p>Excise Taxes     $(61.5)  $(68.2)   $(72.3)  $(69.6)   $(72.7)</p>
<p>Operating Profit $32.0    $41.2      $59.4    $67.4     $70.5 </p>
<p>Op Margin         13%      14%       16%       18%       17%</p>
<p>So for the last 5 years the margin has been in a range of 13% to 18% Why? <em>Because if Exxon-Mobil were to raise prices for a higher profit margin, say 20%, they would could not sell much oil,</em> as their competitors Chevron, Shell, BP etc. would have lower prices. They are profit maximizers.</p>
<p>Going back to the table, out of the &#8220;Revenue&#8221; line, XOM remits &#8220;Excise taxes&#8221; to the government. Let&#8217;s just say at the beginning of 2007, the winner of the pander sweepstakes had passed an &#8220;Excise gas tax holiday!&#8221; so that Exxon-Mobil did not have to forward the $72.7B in excise taxes.</p>
<p>Which of the following would you expect?</p>
<p>1) Price competition causes Exxon to maintain an operating margin around the 13-18% average of the past 5 years.</p>
<p>2) Exxon keeps the $72.7B as profit, resulting in $143.3 B operating profit ( $72.7 + $70.5),or operating margins to double to 35%</p>
<p>If you picked option 1, then you believe tax relief will accrue to the retail customer. If you picked option 2, or &#8220;the economist option,&#8221; then you believe gas tax relief will accrue to the supplier (and that the management of Exxon-Mobil should be summarily fired for leaving so much money on the table over the last 5 years).</p>
<p>Of course you might say &#8220;it&#8217;s somewhere in between, say 20% ops margin&#8221; &#8230;&#8230;..(inferred ops profit of $80B&#8230;in which case the customer would have only kept around 85% of the tax relief). </p>

                                <p>In the next few weeks four excellent and dynamic writers will begin posting at Angry Bear on a soon to be determined but regular basis.  Many already know the quality of thought and expertise each offers, so it is with great pleasure that we welcome them into the fold of Angry Bear contributors.</p>
<p><a href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/">Bruce Webb</a> has offered his expertise on Social Security and other topics on many sites.  He has agreed to write on Social Security at levels that go beyond Soc Sec 101 to allow us deeper thinking on this important topic.  I am hoping he gives a few history lessons along the way.</p>
<p>Tom Bozzo, an economist, publishes at <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/">Marginal Utility</a> on a variety of issues.</p>
<p>Ken Houghton, an economist, also posts at Marginal Utility and <a href="http://economicsquestionoftheday.blogspot.com/">Economic Question of the Day</a> and has commented often at Angry Bear. </p>
<p><a href="http://afferentinput.blogspot.com/">Afferent input</a> is a newcomer who at the moment takes a chart and macro line of posting, and weaves a good narrative.</p>
<p>Angry Bear is an economic blog that includes professional economists, knowledgeable insiders in various positions of business and/or government, and interested amateurs to keep them honest, and as group contributors bring a wealth of expertise, knowledge, experience, and variety of interests to the postings.</p>
<p>While left of center in spirit, we provide at least three ideas somewhat unique to econoblogging in my experience:</p>
<p>First, guest posts are a common feature here, and are accepted from people of all walks of life if well thought out and honest in intent.</p>
<p>Second, some regular contributors have admitted to being Independent or even Republican, but posts are designed to be informative first and partisanship is made clear if they happen to be part of the post.  Partisanship is not the same as &#8216;strong point of view&#8217;.</p>
<p>Third, so far we have been able to maintain open comments, because commentors who might have started as &#8216;snarkers&#8217; have upgraded their comments to take a useful stand.  How cool is that!? </p>
<p>I am excited about the direction these new contributors can take us in addition to our excellent current team.</p>
<p>Welcome.</p>

<blockquote><p>When asked this morning by ABC News&#8217; George Stephanopoulos if she could name a single economist who backs her call for a gas tax holiday this summer, HRC said &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to put my lot in with economists.” I know several of the economists who have been advising Senator Clinton, so I phoned them right after I heard this. I reached two of them. One hadn’t heard her remark and said he couldn’t believe she’d say it. The other had heard it and shrugged it off as “politics as usual.” That’s the problem: Politics as usual &#8230; In case you’ve missed it, we now have a president who doesn’t care what most economists think. George W. Bush doesn’t even care what scientists think. He rejects all experts who disagree with his politics. This has led to some extraordinarily stupid policies. I’m not saying HRC is George Bush. And I&#8217;m not suggesting economists have all the answers. But when economists tell a president or a presidential candidate that his or her idea is dumb – and when all respectable economists around America agree that it’s a dumb idea – it’s probably wise for the president or presidential candidate to listen. When the president or candidate doesn’t, and proudly defends the policy by saying she&#8217;s &#8220;not going to put my lot in with economists,” we’ve got a problem, folks. Even though the summer gas tax holiday is pure hokum, it polls well, which is why HRC and John McCain are pushing it. That Barack Obama is not in favor of it despite its positive polling numbers speaks volumes about the kind of president he’ll be – and the kind of president we’d otherwise get from McCain and HRC. Haven’t we had enough of politicians who reject facts in favor of short-term poll-driven politics?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/05/hillary_its_me_and_ordinary_fo.php">Greg Sargent</a> saw the same ABC interview:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hillary Clinton has just started doing an Indiana town-hall meeting being broadcast on ABC, and George Stephanopoulos asked her a direct question: Could she name a single economist who agrees with her support for the gas tax holiday? Hillary sidestepped the question, and tried to use the complete dearth of expert support for the idea to her advantage, pointing to it as proof that she&#8217;s on the side of ordinary folks against &#8220;elite opinion&#8221; &#8212; a phrase she used twice. &#8220;I think we&#8217;ve been for the last seven years seeing a tremendous amount of government power and elite opinion behind policies that haven&#8217;t worked well for hard working Americans,&#8221; she said. A bit later she added: &#8220;It&#8217;s really odd to me that arguing to give relief to a vast majority of Americans creates this incredible pushback&#8230;Elite opinion is always on the side of doing things that don&#8217;t benefit&#8221; the vast majority of the American people. An ordinary voter begged to differ, however. Stephanopoulos turned the mike over to a woman who said she supported Obama and said she makes less than $25,000 a year. &#8220;I do feel pandered to when you talk about suspending the gas tax,&#8221; the woman said, adding: &#8220;Call me crazy but I actually listen to economists because I think they know what they&#8217;ve studied.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So Senator Clinton thinks telling the voters the truth is elitist.  She’s become the perfect Republican!</p>

                                <p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/kudlow-looks-at-energy.html">Cactus</a> notes that the Carter bashing from <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDM0OGU3Nzk0MTMyMGI3NTU1Y2JmYWVhOWU3OTU4ZGQ=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> is based on misinformation.  This post will focus on what Kudlow argues for the current economy:</p>
<blockquote><p>after the most recent jobs report — which produced a much-smaller-than-expected decline in corporate payrolls, a huge 362,000 increase in the more entrepreneurial household survey (the best gain in five months), and a historically low 5 percent unemployment rate (4.95 percent, to be precise) &#8230; First-quarter GDP growth came in at 0.6 percent. It wasn’t the widely predicted decline, and economists expect that number to be revised up. GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2007 was also up slightly, while the prior two quarters averaged over 4 percent growth.  My pal Jimmy Pethokoukis quotes Stanford professor Robert Hall, who heads the recession-dating committee at the National Bureau of Economic Research: “It seems unlikely that we would ever declare a peak-date when real GDP continued to rise.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Didn’t I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/news-from-employment-report-bls.html">predict</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I peaked over at the NRO’s The Corner to see if Lawrence Kudlow has once again flipped flopped and declared the household survey to be a more accurate reflection of the jobs market</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow, however, does not have the integrity to note that the employment-population was only 62.7% after this “huge” increase or that the payroll survey figure has declined by 260,000 over the past four months.  But to say that a 5% unemployment rate is “historically low” sort of cuts history off at last month.  The unemployment rate was 4.8% in February and was less than 4% for much of 2000.  </p>
<p>But for my money, this ambiguous writing really takes the cake:</p>
<blockquote><p>GDP growth for the fourth quarter of 2007 was also up slightly, while the prior two quarters averaged over 4 percent growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s be more precise – the annualized growth rates for 2008QI and 2007QIV were the same as for 2007QI: 0.6%.  So having a couple of decent quarters hardly makes up for the sluggish growth for the other three.  Especially given the fact that <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/04/30/about-that-gdp-report">final sales demand</a> fell last quarter.</p>
<p>Some have wondered if Kudlow is inflicted with massive stupidity or incredible mendacity.  I submit he’s inflicted with both.</p>

                                <p>Kudlow Looks at Energy</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m playing with some data from the Department of Energy&#8217;s Energy <br />Information Administration this morning. Their <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/stb0101.xls">Table 1.1</a> gives <br />you an energy overview &#8211; showing energy production, imports, and <br />exports. I halt for breakfast, at which point I read this piece by <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NDM0OGU3Nzk0MTMyMGI3NTU1Y2JmYWVhOWU3OTU4ZGQ=">Kudlow</a> and almost choke:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democrats are now calling for a windfall profits tax. Last time we tried that — under Jimmy Carter — foreign energy imports rose 8 to 16 percent and domestic energy production fell 3 to 6 percent. (This according top a study by the Congressional Research Service.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow doesn&#8217;t link to the Congressional Research Service piece and I <br />don&#8217;t feel like looking for it, but I can tell you straight up that the <br />figures Kudlow provided are wrong. Completely wrong.</p>
<p>According to the DOE, energy production figures (billion BTU) look like <br />this:</p>
<p>1976: 61,601,809, <br />1977: 62,051,547 , <br />1978: 63,137,182, <br />1979: 65,947,815 <br />1980: 67,232,462</p>
<p>Can anyone spot the 3 to 6 percent drop? I note that the country&#8217;s <br />annualized increase in energy output was quite a bit faster under Carter <br />than under any of the presidents that followed him, and over 11 times <br />faster than under Reagan, who presumably Kudlow would never accuse of <br />raising taxes on energy.</p>
<p>What about imports? The DOE gives us these figures:</p>
<p>1976: 16,760,058  <br />1977: 19,948,129  <br />1978: 19,106,170  <br />1979: 19,459,809 <br />1980: 15,796,247</p>
<p>To Kudlow that&#8217;s an 8 to 16 percent hike. To me, it looks yes, there was <br />a spike, but it was followed by a rather unusual drop in energy imports. <br />After all, the data provided by the DOE runs from 1949 to 2006, and <br />Carter was the only President under whom imports were lower when he left <br />office than we arrived. I note also that energy exports also increased <br />while Carter was in office, leading to a decline in net energy imports &#8211; <br />something that didn&#8217;t happen under any other president in the sample <br />except Truman (for whom we only have data starting in &#8217;49).</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know what Carter did with taxes, and conditions during <br />an Oil Embargo may not be easily transferable, but I for one am having a <br />hard time being swayed by what Mr. Kudlow wrote.<br />_________________________</p>

                                <p>The rather symbolic arguments and passion demonstrated about the gas tax holiday illustrate the odd and quixotic nature of what catches our imagination.  The $30 I save over the summer has more relevance to my life than the lost $$$$$ (hundreds?) out of my pocket each year, and the notion of security dribbles away as the Pentagon cannot determine the reality of what makes me safe.  Great.  And the voices of concern are heard only faintly.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/national-news/portfolio/2008/04/14/">Pentagons-Accounting-Mess</a> <em>Portfolio</em> comments on accounting methods of the Pentagon.</p>
<blockquote><p>On a winter afternoon in Indianapolis, Jessica Hilligoss, a young Defense Department worker, types long strings of numbers and letters into a computer, helping the United States armed forces transfer the billions of dollars it draws each week from the Federal Reserve to contractors, vendors, and military and civilian personnel.</p>
<p>Her job is to review invoices for everything from construction projects to lawnmowing, and to approve payment. Within a few days, another computer system—behind locked doors in the building&#8217;s basement—deposits the money in the recipients&#8217; bank accounts.</p>
<p>The size of nearly 28 football fields, with a facade of alternating red stucco and white cement tiles, the three-story operations center is the federal government&#8217;s third-largest office building, after the Pentagon and the Ronald Reagan Building, and the place where a big chunk of the Iraq war&#8217;s soaring price is paid. The center doles out more than $104 billion annually, making it Defense&#8217;s largest disburser.</p>
<p>Theoretically, when Hilligoss authorizes a payment, the department should be able to instantly track where the money goes and which program it was spent on, in order to make sure the right amounts are paid to the right recipients at the right times. But it doesn&#8217;t work that way. </p>
<p>Since 2004, the Pentagon has spent roughly $16 billion annually to maintain and modernize the military&#8217;s business systems, but most are as unreliable as ever—even as the surge in defense spending is creating more room for error. The basic defense budget for 2007 was $439.3 billion, up 48 percent from 2001, excluding the vast additional sums appropriated for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. According to federal regulators and current and former Pentagon officials, the accounting process is so obsolete and error prone that it&#8217;s virtually impossible to tell where much of this money ends up. While the department&#8217;s brass has made a few patchwork improvements, billions are still unaccounted for. The problem is so deeply rooted that, 18 years after Congress required major federal agencies to be audited, the Pentagon still can&#8217;t be. (Read a chronology of efforts to modernize the military&#8217;s financial systems.)</p>
<p>For the first three quarters of 2007, $1.1 trillion in Army accounting entries hadn&#8217;t been properly reviewed and substantiated, according to the Department of Defense&#8217;s inspector general. In 2006, $258.2 billion of recorded withdrawals and payments from the Army&#8217;s main account were unsupported. It&#8217;s as if the Army had submitted multibillion-dollar expense reports without any receipts.</p>
<p>Preoccupied with protecting their turf, the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines continue to maintain separate, increasingly outdated systems that can&#8217;t talk to each other, trace disbursements, or detect overbilling by contractors. At the Indianapolis facility, as at the Defense Department&#8217;s four other main U.S. centers for financial operations, accounting programs under the same roof can&#8217;t share information without extensive jury-rigging, as though contracts, payments, and accounting had nothing to do with one another.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Back on April 20th I presented <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/enlightenment-you-and-me-and-china-make.html">my introduction</a> to a book by Will Hutton: The Writing on the Wall. </p>
<p>First, the book is 334 pages.  The list of references 39 pages.  There is a lot I could cover.  But this is the Angry Bear which I view as being about US(of A).  It is this part of Mr. Hutton&#8217;s writing that caught my attention.  As much as I am interested in China&#8217;s life influencing ours, I am more interested in understanding what happened to us.  </p>
<p>I presented his concept of values coming out of the Enlightenment as being the basis for what the USA (as a stand-in for referencing Western processes) had achieved and what China has to move more toward.  It is not that China must model us exactly, but that it&#8217;s current structure is limited.  It needs to be more democratic based on values from the Enlightenment.  Mr. Hutton presents the democratic Enlightenment concepts as four: <em>“accountability; representativenesss; respect for the rule of law; and the capacity, through free speech, for debate, exchange, and interaction.”    </em></p>
<p>As much as the book looks at China and how it does not meet these concepts sufficiently to allow it to grow such that it will meet the needs of it&#8217;s people, I want to focus on his view of us.  In this case, the USA specifically.  I believe he points to the USA because it was the leader in the world, as he presents the case, for manifesting the democratic Enlightenment concepts.  I believe, his view of the Enlightenment is in agreement with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment">Wiki&#8217;s presentation</a>:<br /><em>The Enlightenment is held to be the source of critical ideas, such as the centrality of freedom, democracy and reason as primary values of society. This view argues that the establishment of a contractual basis of rights would lead to the market mechanism and capitalism, the scientific method, religious tolerance, and the organization of states into self-governing republics through democratic means. In this view, the tendency of the philosophes in particular to apply rationality to every problem is considered the essential change.</em></p>
<p>The discussion of Enlightenment begins with free trade and that the USA is <em>“not a natural candidate to support an open world trading and financial system&#8230;”</em>  We benefit, but we are “<em>ambivalent</em>”. “<em>An open trading system tempts every country to pursue strategic trade policies that are much more mercantilist in their rationale&#8230;All genuflect to the rules-based openness of the trading system as regulated by the World Trade Organization.  But they believe in it more because it is the means to secure their strategic, mercantilist aims than because of any desire to create gains in which everyone would share.”  </em></p>
<p>Mr Hutton is pro free trade.  He makes a case that America&#8217;s growth was less do to protectionist positions taken early on and more the result of a growing population with access to free land.  Space and ambition were the key.  As the coasts were joined, we moved to substitute foreign trade for the loss of our frontier.  <em>“The aim was not to create an overseas empire but to export the American idea&#8230;” </em>unlike the European expansionism.  And as expected, he flatly states that free-trade is not the cause of the condition we find ourself in currently.  Though he thinks both sides, one portrayed by Lou Dobbs and the other by Friedman need to be “<em>cooled down</em>”.  They are both “<em>vastly exaggerated</em>”. </p>
<p>The source of our mis-thinking is found in how we view liberty.  “<em>Liberty, in the American narrative, is the sun under which everything flourishes.  Liberty permits individuals&#8217; hard work, courage, and application to produce wealth and happiness.  Government should not get in the way&#8230;Liberty and the American dream are linked&#8230;The great conservative counterrevolution &#8230;has been grounded in its brilliant capacity to exploit these cultural icons to support its own cause.”</em></p>
<p>But this is an error of our self perception. It is more correct to view liberty as a goal within <em>“&#8230;a highly sophisticated Enlightenment political infrastructure.”  </em>“<em>Look at the United States&#8230;and you will see an economy and society characterized by pluralism, diversity, and investment in individual capabilities.”</em></p>
<p>He bolsters this view by presenting Alexis de Tocqueville&#8217;s work about America.  <em>“Public engagement and never-ending argument leavened what otherwise might have been a culture of egoism&#8230;and transmuted it into a culture in which egalitarianism and individualism enriched each other.  Self-interest was not only a matter of bettering oneself; it was also a mattter of ensureing that there would be a vigorous public life and opportunity for others&#8230;The same impulse&#8211;wanting the best for oneself and for others— prompts much of American civic activism.”   </em>Our liberty <em>“always included conceptual egalitarianism, which provided the tension between the ambition and appetites of the propertied rich and their accountability to society.” “This is not the egalitarianism of income or opportunity; rather, it is the equality of self-esteem, self worth and possibility&#8230;there is no obstacle of title, birth, accent or social rank&#8230;”  </em></p>
<p>It make you feel proud, does it not?  Unfortunately he notes we are losing it through <em>“neglect and willful disparagement of their importance, in particular by American conservatives.”</em>  We are losing the <em>“fecund interaction”</em> of markets and the price mechanism with the Enlightenment infrastructure and resultant culture.  Mr Hutton states it was our genius.</p>
<p>This is where I will go next.  What has changed.  I believe it was my very first post via an invite from Cactus (he posted it for me) that I made the statement that we had changed.  We no longer were making money as we had.  We no longer were focused on what we use to. It was more than just tax rates that changed in the Reagan years.</p>
