                                <p>Here&#8217;s a post by ILSM&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>On Friday, Feb 8, 2008 the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs, Subcommittee on International Organizations, Human Rights and Oversight heard testimony from Douglas MacGregor, Col USA (ret) senior fellow at Center for Defense Information. </p>
<p>His topic was the &#8220;Status of Forces Agreement&#8221; (SOFA) recently agreed to by the Bush Administration and the Maliki government in Iraq. The SOFA does more than state what will happen if a drunken GI is hauled in by Iraqi civil authorities. It states the US will engage Maliki&#8217;s enemies foreign and domestic to defend Iraq&#8217;s &#8220;democratic system&#8221;.</p>
<p>Mr. MacGregor points to several issues with the SOFA.</p>
<p>One, the SOFA&#8217;s the US has with South Korea and Germany were part of a treaty ratified by the US Senate. This commitment to defend Iraq&#8217;s &#8220;democratic system&#8221; is not contained in any thing approved by the US congress. How can the administration edge into a long term contravention of the US Constitution?</p>
<p>Second point is that the SOFA addresses protecting the Maliki government from internal threats as well as external. Nothing in NATO or South Korea&#8217;s treaties addressed defending the sitting government against internal threats. The place you have to go to see that kind of treaty establishment is the Warsaw Pact treaty with the soviet dominions behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
<p>The SOFA appears to do what the soviets attempted to do; impose a system on a population with culture and social traditions we have no concern for.</p>
<p>Worse, we are protecting the Shia&#8217;a side of the Iraqi coalition causing the country to fragment along ethnic and religious lines.</p>
<p>Good for the 100 year occupation and bankrupting the US.</p>
<p>Not good for anything else.</p>

Greg fails to bring the counterarguments but <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/02/consumption-and.html">Mark Thoma</a> has including another NY Times discussion from <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/income-and-consumption-inequality">Paul Krugman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now, there’s no question that consumption inequality at a point in time is less than income inequality. But the CEX study on which they rely is widely believed to be seriously flawed, especially for tracking recent trends. For whatever reason, the survey seems to be missing a lot of consumption growth among the affluent.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul also links to a research paper on this topic by Robert J. Gordon and Ian Dew-Becker.</p>

<blockquote><p>Way back when I was teaching, I used to give students zerox copies of the forclosure and bank sale notices from the local papers from the early 1930&#8217;s, and send them out to map and describe what they could actually see as the indications (in an almost anthropological sense) about the impact of the Great Depression of the late 20&#8217;s and early 30&#8217;s.  What I wanted them to comprehend was less the arguments about what was done about those times, but more about what really went wrong, and ultimately how things were fixed.  In essence, I wanted them to have good pictures in their heads as we evaluated what FDR actually did, and the results, and how we should evaluate those results. </p>
<p>Virtually every city in the US has an architectual line between late 1920&#8217;s domestic construction, and what was built in the late 1930&#8217;s.  Most of the lines are mixed constructions &#8212; you will find 2 story houses with gables and creative lines, mixed in with small, well-built, what we today call starter homes, single story, cape cod or ranch styles, rather simple in design.  This is where the speculative builders of the 20&#8217;s left lots in between their offerings, and then in the late 30&#8217;s, with land released by the banks, those who were following the modest income and credit codes of FDR&#8217;s FHA Mortgage program, built the next generation of houses.  Between the houses of the 20&#8217;s, and the late 30&#8217;s is a revolution in Housing Finance as well as ultimately, a considerable cause of the Great Depression. </p>
<p>Prior to the Depression, the majority of homes were purchased on a short term note.  You got a note for 5 years, with a balloon payment at the end, and then one negotiated with the bank for a new note covering the balloon.  Of course the rate of interest would be adjusted with the new note.  But what happened in the 1920&#8217;s, at a time when commercial and investment banking were not seperate, was that Banks moved assets into the attractive stock market which was zooming, and then, after 1929, when they went bust in the market, the liquid cash available to re-finance the balloons simply disappeared, and the Banks took back the housing where owners could not meet the balloon or had cash to cover.  It was not at all unusual after 1929 for Banks to repossess homes that were nearly 2/3rds paid up, with all owner-equity being lost.  So families doubled up, tripled up, and tried to keep one note paid up.  None the less the Banks, repossessing acres of property, mostly failed by the dawn of the FDR Administeration.   As an example, the Bank of Akron President Wendell Willkie, eventually, after reorganization, paid .07 cents on the dollar for savings accounts when it became Second National. </p>
<p>The New Deal contained three elements of a solution to this problem.  First, the division of Banking into two segments, Commercial and Investment, with only small accounts in the commercial segment insured. In addition, the Savings and Loan segment was created, which advantaged small savers with insured accounts, and a small advantage in savings interest rates, but a clear restriction on lending &#8212; limited to local housing that met FHA standards.</p>
<p>What FHA offered was pretty simple, an inspection system that validated whether the construction of a house met all codes, local, and their own, and insurance to the lender if buyers met credit standards.  FHA had a cap on the amount of loans, which was what forced the change in design from the gargoyles of 20&#8217;s style, to the cape cod or ranch design of the late 30&#8217;s.  Porches, sun and front were eliminated, Entry Halls disappeared, rooms got downsized, and kitchens became streamlined with the efficent work triangle, but became much smaller. Compared with the 1920&#8217;s nothing anticipated having household help. </p>
<p>But financially, these new houses, and all that came after them with VA and FHA insured mortgages, offered relatively low down payments, and 20 year or later 30 year mortgages at a fixed rate.  Over time the cap on loans was raised to accomodate inflation and some additional expectations in what was a basic house, but until the late 1970&#8217;s the early 1930&#8217;s reforms held.  Local savings converted into local mortgages, with the lender insured. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>While FDR died in early 45, and Truman retained all his regulatory policy well into the 50&#8217;s, and Eisenhower did not change much, nor did Kennedy or LBJ, it began to change with Nixon, with moving up the cap on FHA loans beyond the rate of inflation, and then following the Carter inflation, the regulation of Savings and Loans was eliminated, leading to the crash of these institutions in the late 1980&#8217;s.  Without understanding cause, or the reason for these plain jane savings organizations in sustaining middle and working class home ownership &#8212; Congress just bailed out the lenders who had the wit to reorganize, and let it go at that.  Essentially they financed the next bump in housing inflation, whether it be in inflated prices for existing homes, speculation in lots for tear-downs in good areas, or McMansion housing far from jobs and culture in the exurbs, that requires vast investment in infrastructure on the part of existing home owners and the states.  Essentially we are back to 1928 what with ARM Mortgage arrangements (like the old Balloons) that can be massively increased without any relationship to wages or salary or the economy, and the &#8220;right&#8221; of the financial institutions (probably foreign speculators in our Real Estate Market) to again foreclose acres and acres of housing.   </p></blockquote>
<p>Sara goes on in the comments section of that post&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Pre FDR and the emergence of FHA, when housing was financed with renewable short term notes, investment in those notes which generally ran 5 years would have been considered a medium term investment. Bankers would have looked at such investments in terms of profit in comparison to, for example a stock or bond investment, or city bond issue, or any other investment vehicle, and made a housing loan if the likely profit from the loan compared favorably with other possibilities.</p>
<p>In the 1920&#8217;s, with the Stock Market on Speed, banks shifted cash into the market &#8212; which offered excellent short term returns between about 1926 and the early fall of 1929, but then came the crash, and they lost their shirt, tie, pants and underwear. Thus funds for renewing housing notes dried up, and banks stopped renewing notes. Since the notes were short term, by about 1931 half of the outstanding home mortgages were being called.</p>
<p>What FDR did, by establishing the Savings and Loan Financial Industry as seperate from Commercial and Investment banking, allowing it to pay a slightly higher interest rate to small savers, but regulating it so that it could, for all practical purposes, invest only in housing that met FHA, and later VA quality standards, was to create a housing finance institution that was NOT directly in competition with other investment vehicles.</p>
<p>Until the mid to late 1970&#8217;s, the Savings and Loans were strictly regulated. They had a cap on the size of Mortgage they could write, (which essentially put a cap on the size of middle class houses), and both the rate of interest they could pay savers, and the rate they could charge borrowers was regulated. For the most part Savings and Loan companies served their local area &#8212; or possibly a region, thus capital created in a community more or less stayed there in the form of investment in new housing sold to people who likely also put their small savings into the local Savings and Loan Company.</p>
<p>With deregulation, Savings and Loan companies could invest outside the housing sector, and outside their region, and in the 70&#8217;s you began to see the results of this. They looked for greater and faster profits, financing resorts, tennis clubs, commercial facilities (malls for instance), and they competed with each other in the CD market (Certificate of Deposit) &#8212; selling this Government insured paper on medium term basis at higher and higher interest rates. (and not to forget the free toaster that went along with buying a 2000 dollar CD). It took a little less than ten years for the Savings and Loans to crash and burn in this deregulated market &#8212; The end of the Reagan years and the Bush I administration saw the Government have to bail out the S&#038;L&#8217;s, at the cost to the taxpayers of billions. (Afterall, the paper they were selling was insured up to a hundred thousand.) In the meantime, the Housing Market inflated, in part as a function of putting Housing back into the same financial market with all other potential investments. So &#8212; back to square one, in a way &#8212; back to the situation that existed pre-FDR in the 20&#8217;s and early 30&#8217;s, except this time the Government (taxpayers) were on the hook to cover the insured savings.</p>
<p>The last stage of de-regulation took place under Bush II. The seperation of Commercial Banking from Investment Banking ended when Congress was persuaded to abolish the Glass-Stegall Act of 1933, meaning that Commercial Banks could now play in the more risky Investment Banking arena. And yes, one thing they did was to create mortgage backed securities that could be traded on the National and International Market in the same way stocks in widgets are traded. The end result is really no different from the late 20&#8217;s and 30&#8217;s &#8212; since the value of low or non-performing loans has crashed, and since the value of the underlying asset is no longer increasing (housing prices dropping), Capital in the hands of Banks is simply leaving the housing sector, not unlike the instinct of Banks in the late 20&#8217;s not being at all interested in renewing mortgage notes.</p></blockquote>

<p>The fixed px settings made the site appear and behave differently depending on the browser and the resolution of the screen.  I was also unable to get haloscan to function in that template.  We have signed up as premium members to gain their esteemed advice. I will be getting old comments back from haloscan as well. </p>
<p>I like the look but need to consider fluid parameters and something easier to adjust, meaning for one thing the corners were hard to adjust.  It required changing px&#8217;s in about six different places (wrap, corner gifs, img, etc.) to adjust for size, each linked to exact numbers like 15px 0 0 15px or 10px 5px 15px. </p>
<p>I appreciate your patience, in that I recieved only one nasty e-mail, and offers to help.  I apologize for the inconvenience.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/opinion/10cox.html?_r=1&#038;th&#038;emc=th&#038;oref=slogin">NYT</a> carries this op-ed from the Federal Reserve people in Texas.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>WITH markets swinging widely, the Federal Reserve slashing interest rates and the word “recession” on everybody’s lips, renewed attention is being given to the gap between the haves and have-nots in America. Most of this debate, however, is focused on the wrong measurement of financial well-being.</p>
<p>It’s true that the share of national income going to the richest 20 percent of households rose from 43.6 percent in 1975 to 49.6 percent in 2006, the most recent year for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has complete data. Meanwhile, families in the lowest fifth saw their piece of the pie fall from 4.3 percent to 3.3 percent.</p>
<p>Income statistics, however, don’t tell the whole story of Americans’ living standards. Looking at a far more direct measure of American families’ economic status — household consumption — indicates that the gap between rich and poor is far less than most assume, and that the abstract, income-based way in which we measure the so-called poverty rate no longer applies to our society.</p>
<p>The top fifth of American households earned an average of $149,963 a year in 2006. As shown in the first accompanying chart, they spent $69,863 on food, clothing, shelter, utilities, transportation, health care and other categories of consumption. The rest of their income went largely to taxes and savings.</p>
<p>The bottom fifth earned just $9,974, but spent nearly twice that — an average of $18,153 a year. How is that possible? A look at the far right-hand column of the consumption chart, labeled “financial flows,” shows why: those lower-income families have access to various sources of spending money that doesn’t fall under taxable income. These sources include portions of sales of property like homes and cars and securities that are not subject to capital gains taxes, insurance policies redeemed, or the drawing down of bank accounts. While some of these families are mired in poverty, many (the exact proportion is unclear) are headed by retirees and those temporarily between jobs, and thus their low income total doesn’t accurately reflect their long-term financial status.</p>
<p>So, bearing this in mind, if we compare the incomes of the top and bottom fifths, we see a ratio of 15 to 1. If we turn to consumption, the gap declines to around 4 to 1. A similar narrowing takes place throughout all levels of income distribution. The middle 20 percent of families had incomes more than four times the bottom fifth. Yet their edge in consumption fell to about 2 to 1.</p>
<p>Let’s take the adjustments one step further. Richer households are larger — an average of 3.1 people in the top fifth, compared with 2.5 people in the middle fifth and 1.7 in the bottom fifth. If we look at consumption per person, the difference between the richest and poorest households falls to just 2.1 to 1. The average person in the middle fifth consumes just 29 percent more than someone living in a bottom-fifth household.</p>
<p>To understand why consumption is a better guideline of economic prosperity than income, it helps to consider how our lives have changed. Nearly all American families now have refrigerators, stoves, color TVs, telephones and radios. Air-conditioners, cars, VCRs or DVD players, microwave ovens, washing machines, clothes dryers and cellphones have reached more than 80 percent of households.</p>
<p>As the second chart, on the spread of consumption, shows, this wasn’t always so. The conveniences we take for granted today usually began as niche products only a few wealthy families could afford. In time, ownership spread through the levels of income distribution as rising wages and falling prices made them affordable in the currency that matters most — the amount of time one had to put in at work to gain the necessary purchasing power.</p>
<p>At the average wage, a VCR fell from 365 hours in 1972 to a mere two hours today. A cellphone dropped from 456 hours in 1984 to four hours. A personal computer, jazzed up with thousands of times the computing power of the 1984 I.B.M., declined from 435 hours to 25 hours. Even cars are taking a smaller toll on our bank accounts: in the past decade, the work-time price of a mid-size Ford sedan declined by 6 percent.</p>
<p>There are several reasons that the costs of goods have dropped so drastically, but perhaps the biggest is increased international trade. Imports lower prices directly. Cheaper inputs cut domestic companies’ costs. International competition forces producers everywhere to become more efficient and hold down prices. Nations do what they do best and trade for the rest.</p>
<p>Thus there is a certain perversity to suggestions that the proper reaction to a potential recession is to enact protectionist measures. While foreign competition may have eroded some American workers’ incomes, looking at consumption broadens our perspective. Simply put, the poor are less poor. Globalization extends and deepens a capitalist system that has for generations been lifting American living standards — for high-income households, of course, but for low-income ones as well.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/10/business/yourtaxes/10lede.html?_r=1&#038;ref=yourtaxes&#038;oref=slogin">Edmund Andrews</a> does a very nice job saying why the mantra over making the Bush tax cuts permanent is just silly:</p>
<blockquote><p>REGARDLESS of who wins the election this fall, the next president and the next Congress will face at least three wrenching decisions that could reshape the nation’s tax system for years to come.  The looming battles are over questions that both parties have been ducking for years. How much should Americans pay in taxes to get what they want? How should the tax burden be distributed between wealthy and poor, businesses and individuals, savers and investors?  And the decisions are becoming harder to avoid, because they involve huge tax cuts that will disappear if Congress fails to act.  The first issue is the future of President Bush’s tax cuts, all of which are scheduled to expire at the end of 2010. Those include lower rates for every income level; tax breaks for two-income families with children; an elimination of the estate tax on inherited wealth; and Mr. Bush’s signature tax cuts on stock dividends and capital gains.  Extending them would reduce revenues by about $3 trillion over the next 10 years, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Those reductions would coincide with sharply rising costs for Social Security and Medicare as millions of baby boomers enter retirement … That percentage sank to 16.3 percent of the G.D.P. in 2004, largely because of Mr. Bush’s tax cuts, but it edged up to 18.8 percent last year as a result of booming corporate profits and investment income.  But government spending remains above 20 percent of G.D.P., and the gap between taxes and spending is likely to widen sharply as a result of the economic slowdown this year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrews not only mocks the supply-side silliness of McCain (as well as Romney) but then he turns on Clinton and Obama as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Democratic contenders, Senator Barack Obama and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, would extend the tax cuts for most people but revoke them for families earning more than $250,000 a year. “I am not bashful about that,” Mr. Obama said at the Democratic candidates’ debate on Jan. 31. “What we have right now is a situation where we cut taxes for people who don’t need them.” &#8230; Democrats have been inconsistent themselves. In Congress, they have embraced “pay as you go” rules, which require lawmakers to pay for the cost of tax cuts with either tax increases or spending cuts, but the Democratic presidential candidates have yet to explain how they would simultaneously pay for a permanent fix to the A.M.T., an extension of Mr. Bush’s tax cuts for the middle class, and their own plans for universal health care. Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama have both vowed that they would raise tax rates on families in the top two income brackets, with the top tax rate climbing back to 39.6 percent from 35 percent today. But both have indicated that they would use that money to pay for expanded health care.</p></blockquote>
<p>Andrews does have kind words for Charles Rangel:</p>
<blockquote><p>For a preview of the clash over revenue, consider the $882 billion tax overhaul proposed last fall by Representative Charles Rangel, Democrat of New York and chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.  Mr. Rangel, going slightly further than Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Obama, would effectively revoke the Bush tax cuts for families earning more than $200,000 a year. Unlike the presidential candidates, however, Mr. Rangel would use almost all of that money to eliminate the alternative minimum tax, leaving none for an expansion of health care.  Mr. Rangel and other House Democratic leaders show no interest in picking a fight over the issue before the fall elections. But when the dust settles and a new president takes over, the challenge will be hard to avoid.</p></blockquote>
<p>If the Democrats do well in the 2008 elections, I’d pay very close attention to what Congressman Rangel is saying.</p>

                                <p>The whole fuss over those evil superdelegates is getting stupid.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_02/013093.php">Kevin Drum</a> allows <a href="http://www.openleft.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=3763">Chris Bowers</a> to state the case against having the Democratic nomination decided by superdelegates.  But then Kevin brings us back to reality:</p>
<blockquote><p>More importantly, though, who decides what the popular will is anyway? Is it number of pledged delegates from the state contests? Total popular vote? Total number of states won? What about uncommitted delegates from primary states? Or caucus states, in which there&#8217;s no popular vote to consult and delegates are selected in a decidedly nondemocratic fashion to begin with?</p></blockquote>
<p>Notice something – Obama isn’t even talking about the popular vote preferring to talk about pledged delegates.  Kevin continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m not very excited at the idea of superdelegates deciding the nomination either, but the only way that will happen is if the primaries end up nearly tied in the first place. Then factor in the number of ways in which the primary/caucus process is nondemocratic from the get go, and it hardly seems practical to insist that superdelegates should all somehow divine a single &#8220;democratic&#8221; result from a very close race. I&#8217;m just not sure how you can do it. Better to simply respect them as human beings and party loyalists, and allow them to vote their consciences.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly!  Now Obama did well yesterday.  So how did the GOP front runner do?  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_02/013092.php">Kevin</a> also that one too and it was not pretty.</p>

                                <p>In an interesting <a href="http://japanfocus.org/products/details/2661">study</a> of Zhongguancun (ZGC), sometimes know as China&#8217;s &#8220;Silicon Valley,&#8221; Yu Cho, an associate professor at Vassar, offers an interesting answer on how China can escape the domination of the multinationals, especially in the area of IT.</p>
<p>Yu Cho acknowledges what this writer has been saying repeatedly: Multinationals in China are there primarily to export, contributing more than the lion&#8217;s share of exported IT. In fact, they and their subcontractors are driving Chinese exports in IT and other areas.</p>
<p>Before I look more closely at Cho&#8217;s interesting observations, I want to step aside for a moment to ask why this observation hits such a raw nerve from some commentators here and is totally ignored by most economists. That foreign multinationals are the lynchpin of Chinese export machine seems to me very clear.</p>
<p>Chinese authorities acknowledge this; CEO&#8217;s acknowledge</p>
<p>Sam Palismano, CEO of IBM, writing in &#8220;Foreign Affairs,&#8221; <a href="http://www.ibm.com/ibm/governmentalprograms/samforeignaffairs.pdf">said</a>:<br />
<blockquote>By one estimate, between 2000 and 2003 alone, foreign firms built 60,000 manufacturing plants in China. Some of these factories target the local Chinese market, but others target the global market. European chemical companies, Japanese carmakers, and U.S. industrial conglomerates are all building (or have declared their intention to build) factories in China to supply export markets around the world. Similarly, banks, insurance companies, professional-service firms, and it companies are building R&#038;D and service centers in India to support employees, customers, and production worldwide&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yi Xiaozhun, China&#8217;s Vice Commerce Minister, <a href="http://english.people.com.cn/200602/15/eng20060215_243015.html">said</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Foreign-funded enterprises in China enjoyed 83 percent of China&#8217;s total foreign trade surplus and accounted for 58 percent of China&#8217;s total exports, announced Vice Commerce Minister Yi Xiaozhun at China-US Business Forum in Beijing on Feb. 14, 2006</p></blockquote>
<p>Why are these facts so uncomfortable? Do people really think that China has suddenly become a global competitor without some very substantial help from our corporations? Do they really think this really a &#8220;patent&#8221; problem?</p>
<p>Really, look around your house. American products that a few years ago were made in America, where are they made now? Our trade deficit is becoming permanent economic fixture.</p>
<p>Yet, as the trade deficit grew, the stock market boomed. How did that happen? No one has solved that riddle yet, even though the answer is right in front of them.</p>
<p>Anyone who compares Japan&#8217;s earlier meteoric rise with today&#8217;s China is making an erroneous comparison. Japan was devasted after WWII. Never in the 20th century could anyone claim Japan was an impoverished third world country. After WWII, Japan had the education and skills to recapture its recently lost place in the world&#8217;s economy. China is not Japan. Any comparisons are ill-advised and foolish.</p>
<p>I can posit only two <i>polite</i> reasons why the above observations are uncomfortable:
<ol>
<li>Some economists refuse to look directly at the trade deficit. Among these are Bernanke and Mankiw. <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2006/03/is-us-trade-deficit-problem.html">Mankiw</a>, for example, sees our problem as a lack of savings:</p>
<blockquote><p>My view is that the trade deficit is not a problem in itself but is a symptom of a problem. The problem is low national saving. Given that national saving is low, I am not eager for the trade deficit to disappear, because that would mean that domestic investment would need to fall to the low level of national saving.</p></blockquote>
<p>I find the logic of his comment truly bizarre. How is the trade deficit a sympton of low national savings? Furthermore, he is not anxious for the trade deficit to disappear because then domestic investment would have to fall to the low level of national saving?</p>
<p>Have I heard him correctly? If the trade deficit disappears, domestic investment would fall to the abysmal level of our national saving? So, if we started to export more, that would mean domestic investment would fall? Let&#8217;s see: If we start to export more, domestic companies would not invest more in order to increase those rising exports? Has this guy been in business? I am trying to be polite here and I am having a hard time doing so.</p>
</li>
<li>Other economists feel very uncomfortable acknowledging where the U.S. companies are manufacturing the goods it sells to U.S. consumers. Instead, they tend to look at the problem as merely a financial one: We are becoming too dependent on capital inflows. Among these, I include Krugman. Krugman believes in globalization&#8211;and all the manna that it is supposed to deliver to the U.S.
<p>Consequently, job loss and trade deficits are politely set aside so that they can focus on a tertiary effect: Capital inflows. They simply will not look at the primary causation. They have put too much intellectual capital on the line.</p>
<p>I would assert that if we solved the trade deficit, we would not have to worry about capital inflows. Sell more to the rest of the world, I say.* Investment here would rise. Our tax haul would be greater. We would not have to depend on capital inflows to pay our bills.</p>
<p>Well, I have gotten off-topic, far away from Yu Cho&#8217;s answer to China&#8217;s dilemma. After all, China is dependent for its IT exports on the multinationals. China has a problem, too.</p>
<p>The crux of Cho&#8217;s answer to China&#8217;s problem is that indigenous Chinese firms are in a better position to capture the growing Chinese market for two reason. First,</p>
<blockquote><p>MNCs can introduce advanced technology, they typically have standardized practices that are insensitive to local markets or inappropriate for them, especially when purchasing power is low</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the purchasing power of the Chinese consumer is low. As a consumer of finished goods&#8211;not infrastructure&#8211;, China has quite a ways to go.</p>
<p>The MNC&#8217;s are not targeting the Chinese consumer, despite all the hoopla. MNC&#8217;s are there to capture the export market. In short, sell the goods to America and other developed countries.  (I pointed out a while ago that Canada, which has a trade surplus with the U.S, has a large and rising trade deficit with China.)</p>
<p>And secondly,<br />
<blockquote>Left to their own devices, MNCs also lack the incentives, flexibility, and local knowledge to react to market changes. In contrast, indigenous firms understand their home court and have greater commitment and flexibility to bring <i>appropriate and affordable technology to domestic consumers</i>. However, MNCs, despite their drawbacks, are necessary partners for collaboration and potential role models to learn and perhaps importantly, deviate from. [Italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p></li>
</ol>
<p>Read carefully: &#8220;the appropriate and affordable technology to domestic consumers.&#8221;</p>
<p>* The scope of this piece does not allow on how to solve the problem. The first step is to acknowledge the nature of the problem, both for China and for the U.S.</p>

<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/kudlow-on-how-to-pay-for-increased.html">Cactus</a> caught <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OGVmNDEzYzhhMWYyM2MyMGEwZTQxYmEzMTg0NTY3Y2Y=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> spouting his free lunch supply-side stupidity again earlier this week:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economist Art Laffer correctly noted in a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed that reducing the top marginal tax rate on investment and high personal incomes is a pro-growth revenue gainer. But cutting taxes for the middle-class and shoveling more earned-income tax credits toward the working poor is a huge revenue loser. (Of course, the Congressional Budget Office will score the top-rate tax cuts as revenue losers, despite Laffer’s strong data-driven arguments to the contrary.)  But my point is a larger one. It’s really a political issue. What will McCain and Romney do? They both want to expand the defense budget and the size of the military, as they should, to strengthen our national security in the War on Terror. But this, of course, costs money. Big money. President Reagan argued successfully in the 1980s that low tax rates reignite economic growth &#8211; growth that was absolutely essential to generate the resources necessary for a strong national-security posture. Will McCain and Romney adopt the Reagan approach, or will they see higher tax rates as a tradeoff to a stronger military à la Eisenhower?</p></blockquote>
<p>Kudlow is touting the real GOP agenda – tax the working poor but don’t tax the rich.  He fails to explain why such Nibor Dooh policies foster more long-term growth.  Instead he implies that some serious research paper by Art Laffer has proven this case somehow.  Funny – he failed to tell us the title of this paper or which academic journal chose to publish Laffer’s laugher.  </p>
<p>Kudlow confuses the Keynesian recovery that was to inevitably follow the collapse of aggregate demand in 1982 with long-term growth.  One can also note that the 1950’s recessions with the same frequency of the 1970’s.  To clarify matters, we’ve done two things.  Show real GDP growth for each year of the second half of last century (1951 to 2000).  While the period from 1951 to 1980 did have its share or low or negative real GDP growth, it also had some periods of very rapid GDP growth.  The next two years had only two recessions but the Reagan recession leading to the largest unemployment rate since the Great Depression.  </p>
<p>The second thing we do is to report the average annual GDP growth rates for three periods.  Real GDP as of 1980QIV was 281.4% higher than it was as of 1950QIV, which means during the 30 year period that included the Eisenhower, Kennedy-Johnson, Nixon-Ford, and Carter years, average real GDP growth was 3.5%.  Real GDP as of 1992QIV was 143.2% higher than it was as of 1980QIV, which means during the 12 year period of Reagan-Bush41, average real GDP growth was only 3.0%.  Real GDP as of 2000QIV was 132.7% higher than it was as of 1992QIV, which means during the Clinton Administration, average real GDP growth was 3.6%.  One of the reasons for the dip in long-term growth rates during the Reagan-Bush41 era of lower tax rates may have to do with the fact that government spending as a share of GDP did not decline while consumption demand was encouraged by these lower tax rates.  Simply put – the 1981 tax cut lowered national savings leading to a crowding-out of investment.  </p>
<p>In countless opeds from Kudlow where he spins the data, I have yet to see him recognize either crowding-out or the basic Solow growth model, which emphasizes the role of savings.  In fact, I have yet to see this National Review nitwit recognize that when the sum of consumption and government purchases rise – which is the direct effect of the fiscal fiascos that he thinks are pro-growth – the national savings rate falls (by definition).  One would think someone who cannot articulate the basics of the role of fiscal policy on long-term growth would never be asked to ink an op-ed on this topic for any respectable publication.  Ah but we are talking about the National Review which prides itself on serial stupidity.</p>
