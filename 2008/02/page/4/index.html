                                <p>Republicans tend to like less oversight.  Steve Benen has a story about what happened to the National Republican Congressional Committee when it <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/archives/14701.html">decided to reduce the oversight to its own finances</a>.  Its a funny story.</p>
<p>Conservatives like to say a conservative is a liberal who got mugged.  As Benen&#8217;s funny story shows, this may be another example where the Republican story-line is diametrically opposed to reality.  Sometimes a liberal is a conservative who got fleeced.</p>

                                <p>I have a question for my former hometown newspaper – the LA Times: why do you let <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg26feb26,0,7243562.column">Jonah Goldberg</a> pollute your pages:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8216;Everything was absolutely ideal on the day I bombed the Pentagon.&#8221; This excerpt from William Ayers&#8217; memoir appeared in the New York Times on the morning of Sept. 11, 2001 &#8211; a few hours before Al Qaeda terrorists crashed hijacked planes into the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Ayers, once a leader in the Weather Underground &#8211; the group that declared &#8220;war&#8221; on the U.S. government in 1970 &#8211; told the Times, &#8220;I don&#8217;t regret setting bombs&#8221; and &#8220;I feel we didn&#8217;t do enough.&#8221; Ayers recently reappeared in the news because Politico.com reported Friday that Barack Obama has loose ties to him &#8230; don&#8217;t think Obama supports domestic terrorism, and I&#8217;m sure he can offer eloquent explanations for why he shouldn&#8217;t suffer any guilt by association &#8230; What fascinates me, though, is how light the baggage is when one travels from violent radicalism to liberalism. A local Chicago activist told Politico&#8217;s reporter that Ayers &#8220;is one of my heroes in life.&#8221; Cass Sunstein, a first-rank liberal intellectual, added, &#8220;I feel very uncomfortable with their past, but neither of them is thought of as horrible types now &#8211; so far as most of us know, they are legitimate members of the community.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So are we liberals <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Liberal-Fascism-American-Mussolini-Politics/dp/0385511841">fascists</a> or are we terrorists?  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_02/013198.php">Kevin Drum</a> tries to divine what Jonah is trying to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>Apparently the Democratic primary campaign has been sadly lacking in irrelevant 60s-era culture war skirmishes and Jonah hopes that will change in tonight&#8217;s debate. After all, if Obama and Clinton aren&#8217;t willing to engage in grandstanding denunciations of 60s radicals on national TV, they&#8217;re just a short hop away from nominating the head of Hamas to be secretary of state, aren&#8217;t they?</p></blockquote>
<p>Those who run the LA Times should realize that this kind of garbage is what makes the National Review a rag.  But hey – I live in New York so now I have to deal with David Brooks and Bill Kristol polluting my home town newspaper.  </p>

<blockquote><p>What the situations in Iraq and Afghanistan have in common is that it will take a major and consistent U.S. effort throughout the next administration at least to win either war. Any American political debate that ignores or denies the fact that these are long wars is dishonest and will ensure defeat. There are good reasons that the briefing slides in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/related/topic/U.S.+Armed+Forces?tid=informline" target="">U.S. military</a> and aid presentations for both battlefields don&#8217;t end in 2008 or with some aid compact that expires in 2009. They go well beyond 2012 and often to 2020.<br />If the next president, Congress and the American people cannot face this reality, we will lose. <strong>Years of false promises about the speed with which we can create effective army, police and criminal justice capabilities in Iraq and Afghanistan </strong>cannot disguise the fact that mature, effective local forces and structures will not be available until 2012 and probably well beyond. This does not mean that U.S. and allied force levels cannot be cut over time, but a serious military and advisory presence will probably be needed for at least that long, and rushed reductions in forces or providing inadequate forces will lead to a collapse at the military level.<br />The most serious problems, however, are governance and development. Both countries face critical internal divisions and levels of poverty and unemployment that will require patience. These troubles can be worked out, but only over a period of years. Both central governments are corrupt and ineffective, and they cannot bring development and services without years of additional aid at far higher levels than the Bush administration now budgets. Blaming weak governments or trying to rush them into effective action by threatening to leave will undercut them long before they are strong enough to act.</p></blockquote>

<p>So this person says to stay, and by implication tar and feather the people who got us into this mess.  Hmmmm.  I like this counterrorism blog.  Thanks Red State.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://counterterrorismblog.org/2008/02/let_the_protect_america_act_ex.php">One opinion on the Protect America Act</a> offers a viewpoint that caught my eye. On the other hand, there were lots of opinions about this in posts.</p>
<blockquote><p>While I agree with my colleagues, Dennis Lormel and Jeffrey Breinholt, that renewal of the Protect America Act should be considered by Congress as urgent and serious business, it’s misplaced to ascribe current delays to merely “playing politics.”</p>
<p>Few pieces of legislation before Congress carry such gravity and importance when it comes to the twin goals of protecting our national security and preserving our civil liberties. Such matters should be considered with gravity and thorough deliberation. And there is much in this act which deserves further deliberation. Many of its current provisions were adopted previously under an atmosphere of high tension and great pressure from the White House. The only pressure now is that President Bush threatens to veto any further temporary extension of the current act. A temporary extension would certainly have kept in place sufficient authority to keep tabs on the potential terrorists within our midst as Congress worked through the act thoroughly.</p>
<p>And, as Richard Clarke wrote earlier this month in the Philadelphia Inquirer:</p>
<p>“Let me be clear: Our ability to track and monitor terrorists overseas would not cease should the Protect America Act expire. If this were true, the president would not threaten to terminate any temporary extension with his veto pen. All surveillance currently occurring would continue even after legislative provisions lapsed because authorizations issued under the act are in effect up to a full year. “Simply put, it was wrong for the president to suggest that warrants issued in compliance with FISA would suddenly evaporate with congressional inaction. Instead &#8211; even though Congress extended the Protect America Act by two weeks &#8211; he is using the existence of the sunset provision to cast his political opponents in a negative light. “For this president, fear is an easier political tactic than compromise. With FISA, he is attempting to rattle Congress into hastily expanding his own executive powers at the expense of civil liberties and constitutional protections.”<br />So what is the current debate in Congress really about? It’s about just how deeply we really need to encroach on our civil liberties to assure our national security, and on the extent of the protections, checks and balances, that should remain in place to limit police power infringements of civil and privacy rights to those truly warranted by the circumstances. History has shown, including our own national history, that we must constantly assure that such adequate protections, checks and balances, are in place. And, I believe, that using our courts to hold those that usurp or violate these inherently dangerous authorities responsible, is an essential protection. The 52 lawsuits now pending before the US courts would test, specifically, whether such usurpation actually occurred. And, if a government agency, or those complicit with it, did usurp or abuse their authority, or make a serious mistake, unduly infringing our rights(and I hope that it will be found that this is not the case), they should pay for their misdeeds just as we would expect any of our neighbors or business colleagues to do.</p>
<p>It is this ability of simple citizens to hold government and private entities and individuals liable for their misdeeds that best assures that they will act responsibly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Several readers thought Angry Bear was becoming an echo chamber for the lefties. So I went to Red State, a blog decidedly not lefty, and found this site on their blogroll. Of course, since I did the looking, I brought back an opinion by one expert I agree with. You will have to go there for yourself to find other opinions and viewpoints.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A few days ago, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/worst-case-for-savings-ever.html">PGL noted this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dalton then advocates measures to increase savings – which means reduce consumption and aggregate demand. Maybe this would be a good approach for long-term growth when investment demand is booming and the Federal Reserve is contemplating higher interest rates to cool aggregate demand in a full employment economy. But when investment demand is falling, reducing consumption demand only makes the insufficiency of aggregate demand worse.</p></blockquote>
<p>And of course, PGL is right.  </p>
<p>But <a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/02/austerity-solution-to-america-economic.html">One Salient Oversight</a> argues that with real interest already so low, and the government already running such a big deficit, expansionary monetary (pumping even more money into the economy) and fiscal (tax cuts) policy won&#8217;t work, and its time to focus on the long run:</p>
<blockquote><p>The problem now, however, is what is the US going to do in order to solve their current problem? Since careless expansionary fiscal and monetary policy caused the current crisis, should we assume that expansionary fiscal and monetary policy can solve it?</p>
<p>Bush and the Fed (now under Bernanke) certainly think so. Bush is trying to push through a &#8220;rescue package&#8221; bill in congress that would attempt to provide much needed fiscal stimulus to the different markets in America that need it most (mainly, I believe, the housing market). Meanwhile, Bernanke at the Fed has been lowering rates as though it were going out of style. In fact, the rate cuts have been so substantial that the market is getting spooked by them.</p>
<p>I do not think, though, that these will work. US Federal government debt is already so high that interest repayments on government debt now exceed 3% of GDP. A continual and growing deficit has already begun to eat up federal spending to such a degree that the interest charges alone rival defence spending and health care costs. A fiscal stimulus package of the sort that Bush is proposing will simply result in higher deficits. Whatever growth such a package could encourage would be sucked up by the downturn that high deficits would have later.</p>
<p>Similarly, Bernanke&#8217;s cutting of interest rates is problematic. I have argued elsewhere on this blog that the declining US currency, now dredging the bottom of historical lows, will have an inflationary effect upon the economy. Oil, now at $100 per barrel, is spreading inflation too. The question is, though, whether the inflationary effects of a declining currency and high oil prices will be balanced out by the deflationary effects of an economic downturn. I doubt it, for the simple reason that other countries who have suffered currency devaluations and/or high oil prices always ended up in the mire of stagflation &#8211; high inflation mixed in with economic stagnation. Bernanke&#8217;s cutting of rates, during a period in which inflation is already eating into the value of people&#8217;s wages and savings, is a dangerous move.</p>
<p>So, if the solution is not through expansionary policies, then it can only come through contractionary ones &#8211; Austerity. Put simply, this involves an increase in saving money &#8211; and by money I mean cash in bank accounts, not money invested in shares or property that can lose value. Moreover, such saving needs to be protected from the ravages of inflation.</p>
<p>For an Austerity program to run in America, both the government and the Federal Reserve need to do the exact opposite of what they are currently doing. Instead of spending money and creating deficits, the government needs to run a fiscal surplus and pay back debt owed. This would involve raising taxes or cutting spending (mainly on health care or military costs) or a combination of both, in such a way that tax revenue exceeds expenditure, thus allowing earlier retirement of government debt (which is essentially paying off the principal earlier).</p>
<p>Instead of creating money and stirring inflation through lower interest rates, the Federal Reserve needs to increase rates to encourage household savings and control inflation (higher interest rates will make saving money more attractive to households and businesses, while at the same time killing off inflation, thus making money more valuable to keep rather than spend).</p>
<p>Of course, such actions are clearly contractionary. In other words, the austerity program I am proposing will, in effect, make the recession worse. Such an austerity program would cause a significant economic downturn that will result in high unemployment. Is it worth it?</p>
<p>Yes. It is. At some point in the future, an austerity program will be tried. It may occur next year, it may occur next decade. The issue is that the sooner such a program can be implemented, the easier it will be to recover from its shocks. Leave it too long, however, and the shocks will take longer to recover from, and the more potential damage such inaction will cause.</p>
<p>The shock of running an austerity program will be deep but, as Keynsian economists would point out, a recovery will eventually arrive. Not only that, but increased tax revenues from this recovery will make it easier for governments to pay off debt (assuming they remain fiscally restrained) thus making it easier for future governments to avoid the mess the current generation is in.</p></blockquote>
<p>My view&#8230;  recessions generally end by themselves, usually after about nine months or so.  And yes, I don&#8217;t think monetary policy will help at this time &#8211; the Fed has been carrying the economy since GW took office.  Any vaccine, given often and long enough to a patient, loses its effectiveness.  And we&#8217;ve reached this point.  Tax cuts aren&#8217;t going to help &#8211; they aren&#8217;t going to increase spending, and if they do, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/some-candorville-about-stimulus.html">they won&#8217;t increase spending here</a>.</p>
<p>So what I think is this&#8230;  let the recession run its course.  No &#8220;help&#8221; from the Fed.  (In fact, if the Fed wants to help in a small way, paradoxically they should raise interest rates.  Maybe the folks on fixed incomes, the ones who haven&#8217;t been spending money in the last seven years, might actually spend a bit of money if they had it.  Those who spent because money was cheap are being foreclosed on left and right, and a cut in interest rates won&#8217;t help them or their resetting ARM now that their home is worth 20% less than they paid for it.)  And no tax cuts&#8230; let the gubmint bank that money.  Because if this is that rare event that is worse than a run of the mill recession, someone will need to spend a lot of money to get us out of it, and the private sector is too much in hock to do it.</p>

<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON &#8211; The Marine Corps has asked the Pentagon&#8217;s inspector general to examine allegations that a nearly two-year delay in the fielding of blast-resistant vehicles led to hundreds of combat casualties in Iraq.</p>
<p>The system for rapidly shipping needed gear to troops on the front lines has been examined by auditors before and continues to improve, Col. David Lapan, a Marine Corps spokesman, said Monday night. Due to the seriousness of the allegations, however, &#8220;the Marine Corps has taken the additional step&#8221; of requesting the IG investigation, Lapan said in an e-mailed statement.</p>
<p>In a Jan. 22 internal report, Franz Gayl, a civilian Marine Corps official, accused the service of &#8220;gross mismanagement&#8221; that delayed deliveries of the mine-resistant, ambush-protected trucks.</p>
<p>Gayl&#8217;s study, which reflected his own views, said cost was a driving factor in the decision to turn down a February 2005 &#8220;urgent&#8221; request from battlefield commanders for the so-called MRAPs.</p>
<p>Stateside authorities saw the hulking vehicles, which weigh up to 40 tons and can cost as much as a $1 million each, as a financial threat to programs aimed at developing lighter vehicles that were years from being fielded, charged Gayl, who prepared the study for the Marine Corps&#8217; plans, policies and operations department.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Veterans of Foreign Wars, the nation&#8217;s oldest veterans organization, said if Gayl&#8217;s allegations are true, charges should be brought against the military and civilian officials who failed to deliver the MRAPs.</p>
<p>If, however, Gayl&#8217;s findings are incorrect, he should be held accountable for his actions, said VFW National Commander George Lisicki in a Feb. 19 letter to members of Congress.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no doubt MRAPs have saved many lives in horrendous (improvised explosive device) explosions, but to accuse the Marine Corps of knowingly and intentionally jeopardizing the safety of fellow Marines on the battlefield is a very serious charge,&#8221; Lisicki said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Things like this don&#8217;t happen because someone tried to do the wrong thing.  They happen because resource are scarce, and people make the best decision they can with the information available.  And when the cheerleading overwhelms what information is actually available, bad decisions are made.  The reason MRAPs weren&#8217;t a priority is that given the costs, they weren&#8217;t considered a worthwhile expenditure because the Iraq War was just about over (as it had been for the previous two years).  But now the corner had been turned, the insurgents were in their last throes, and of course, there was this:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R8QKle1KKpI/AAAAAAAABAc/lhmGPtpv2kg/s1600-h/lowrywinning.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R8QKle1KKpI/AAAAAAAABAc/lhmGPtpv2kg/s320/lowrywinning.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>It was in that world that the decision was made not to purchase MRAPs.  And who knows how many other equally disastrous decisions were made because the administration and its cheerleaders made wishful thinking a substitute for cold, hard facts.  Purchasing MRAPs under that environment was equivalent to being one of the unpatriotic folks who questioned the daydreams, one of those who hated the troops and emboldened the enemy.  Very few people in the Pentagon would have been crazy enough to go that route in the Bush/Cheney Pentagon of 2005.  </p>
<p>And as a result, a terrible price was paid.  It wasn&#8217;t paid by those who imposed their will on the facts, nor by the cheerleaders, nor even (for the most part) by those who had internal questions but went along.  It was paid by the troops.</p>

                                                                    </div>

<p>I was watching the unwholesome but humorous Bill Maher the other night and heard Rep. Jack Kingston,R-GA, say that Barack Obama wasn&#8217;t patriotic and wouldn&#8217;t salute the American flag. This was a fake talking point in one of the two vicious attack emails from the Republican right wing I had gotten and forwarded to the Obama campaign a month ago, which also included numerous racial and religious insults. </p>
<p>Mr. Kingston is a slight man, blue eyed and mild looking with glasses, a member of the Episcopalian Church in Savannah, with four kids and was formerly an insurance salesman with Palmer &#038; Cay in Savannah before entering politics. He&#8217;s in his 8th term in the US Congress. His District was gerrymandered to carve off most of Savannah, luckily for him. The remainder was plugged into a weird-shaped Black district stretching all the way to Atlanta. Gotta isolate those &#8220;nigrah&#8217;s&#8221; in their own political box? Guess the &#8220;white libruls&#8221; just got dropped in the Savannah river.</p>
<p>As Kingston chatted about the brilliant son of Hawaii with such oily disdain, I checked and found his own patriotism was only skin deep. I found no record he&#8217;d ever personally served in the military, despite myriad allusions to &#8220;veterans&#8221; on his official website. As I watched him chatting with Maher and his fellow right wing speechwriter on the panel, I half closed my eyes and saw a black forked tongue flick out between his lips, and heard the leathery sound of scales as he shifted in his seat. I wondered what would burst forth from his skin if one were to waterboard him, a practice he seems to favor?</p>
<p>It almost made me send a letter to some newspapers, but then I thought: if people will vote for that kind of phony trash, they deserve him. It also reminded me why I left home in Savannah at a young age almost five decades ago, and never moved back. Things don&#8217;t seem to have changed, except for the worse. Maybe the Lord will render a miracle down there in the next election? </p>

                                <p>The latest worthless rant from <a href="http://x/">Bill Kristol</a> ends with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Paul Krugman is off today.</p></blockquote>
<p>This must explain why the oped had such a major boo-boo (to be explained in a moment).  The oped goes off with attacking Obama’s patriotism for that pin issue.  It is such a silly argument that I’ll leave to others to comment.  Let’s take a look at some debate between Michele Obama and Mr. Kristol:</p>
<blockquote><p>Michelle Obama’s adult life goes back to the mid-1980s. Can it really be the case that nothing the U.S. achieved since then has made her proud? Apparently. For, as she said later in the same appearance: “Life for regular folks has gotten worse over the course of my lifetime, through Republican and Democratic administrations. It hasn’t gotten much better.”  Now in almost every empirical respect, American lives have in fact gotten better over the last quarter-century.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m outsourcing this one to <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/2008/02/mr-kristol-you.html">Dani Rodrik</a> who provides <a href="http://rodrik.typepad.com/dani_rodriks_weblog/WindowsLiveWriter/image_26.png">this chart</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It shows the median compensation since 1980 of different groups of prime-aged men, alongside productivity. People like me with graduate degrees have done great.  But the median compensation (that includes fringe benefits, by the way) of high school graduate men has declined by about 10 percent since 1980!  Mr. Kristol: that means that for a high-school graduate, the odds that his compensation would have fallen by more than 10% is 50-50.  Note that even college graduates have not seen any income gains since around 2000.  The increase in labor productivity has outpaced the earnings of all these groups, including that of workers with graduate degrees.  (The outcomes for women have been much better.)   What is special about the last quarter century, as Frank Levy makes clear, is that it followed a period when productivity increases were broadly shared by different groups in society. That is no longer the case, and some groups have definitely been left worse off&#8211;not just in relative but also in absolute terms. So statistics aside, who do you think has a better sense of what has happened to &#8220;regular folk&#8221; since 1980? Michelle Obama or Mr. Kristol?</p></blockquote>
<p>Dani gave Kristol a C.  I think that was a gentlemen’s C.  Memo to New York Times – leave the economics to Paul Krugman.  Please!</p>

<blockquote><p>Nobody was seriously hurt and no damage was done on the ground. But the crash of a B-2 stealth bomber on the Pacific island of Guam yesterday – the first involving this type of aircraft – was the world&#8217;s worst air disaster by one measure: money.</p>
<p>Only 22 B-2s have ever been made. The cost of building each one is between $1.2bn (£610m) and $1.3bn, but once development costs are factored in, the figure approaches $2bn per aircraft. By comparison, the British Airways Boeing 777 written off in the Heathrow crash last month (again without serious injury) would have cost around $160m.</p></blockquote>
<p>Fortunately, nobody was seriously hurt, but there went about four and a half percent of the country&#8217;s B-2 fleet.  Are those things really worth $1.2 at the margin?</p>

<div><a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0208/CNNs_question_Obamas_patriotism.html">Politico</a> carries this observation about CNN:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>CNN&#8217;s question: Obama&#8217;s patriotism</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to say, I&#8217;ve never seen a reader poll like this on a mainstream media website (or, to be honest, a right-wing blog). This is currently on CNN.com.</p>
<p>And just today (in a very interesting exchange with the Cleveland Jewish community) Obama was touting CNN&#8217;s piece debunking the notion that he&#8217;d gone to a madrasa: &#8220;We had to send CNN to look at the school that I attended in Indonesia where kids were wearing short pants and listening to ipods to indicate that this was not a madrassa but was a secular school in Indonesia.&#8221;</p>
<p>This question seems tied to this story, in which he took a question about his patriotism. But it&#8217;s odd to see the mainstream media drive a largely whispered question that none of his main, named critics — Hillary, McCain or the RNC — will touch.</p></blockquote>

<p>What could possibly be on their minds?  For any candidate?</p>
