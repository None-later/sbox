                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Municipal Bonds and Code Red</p>
<p>We always seem to be behind the curve; always reacting, seldom proacting. Two very disparate pieces interest me: One an article, the other a report. Both have common elements, although it may be strange that I am yoking them together like some awkward sixteenth century metaphysical English poet.</p>
<p>The first is a disturbing article in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/reuters/feeds/reuters/2008/02/12/2008-02-13T014640Z_01_N12643036_RTRIDST_0_HOLD-MUNICIPALS-AUCTION-RATE-SOURCES-UPDATE-2.html">Forbes</a> regarding auctions of municipal bonds.<br />
<blockquote>On Feb. 12, two muni auctions failed, and experts said that was the first time this had ever happened. Conditions have only worsened since then, they explained.</p></blockquote>
<p>Municipalities will have to pay higher short-term interest rates. Not good. Fed lowers rates; mortgage rates go up. Municipalities will pay higher rates as well. &#8220;Conditions have only worsened since then,&#8221; we are told. I hesitate to say what this forebodes. Let spring come soon. We need to smell the flowers.</p>
<p>The second is an equally disturbing piece, a study at <a href="http://www.carbonequity.info/">Carbon Equity</a> entitled &#8220;Climate Code Red.&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, we are behind the curve. Scientific studies are always two to three years old before they find the light of day. Collect the data; test the hypothesis; send it to an editor; peer reviewed and challenged, emended, corrected.</p>
<p>Remember how I am always yammering that a prior IPCC report said Arctic Sea Ice Melt was decades a way (2030)? Yet, a year or two later, it seems to be occurring?</p>
<p>&#8220;Code Red&#8221; hammers this point home with additional force. This summer, we saw the disappearance of 460,000 square miles of sea ice, &#8220;roughly the size of California and Texas combined.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>As well, large areas of the Arctic sea-ice are now only one metre deep, which means the thickness of the ice has halved since 2001 (Bjornes, 2007), down from 3.5 metres in the early 1960s, and about 2.5 metres in the late 1980s and early 1990s (Blakemore and Sandell, 2006)&#8230;.When the sea-ice thins to around half a metre in thickness, it will be subject to even more rapid disintegration</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In addition, it now appears that winter sea-ice is not resetting fully. Mark Serreze told the AGU meeting that “We had always thought, that at least in the early stages of climate warming, that the Arctic sea-ice would recover in the autumn” because “after all even with the globally warmed world, winter happens in the Arctic, we’ll still have refreeze of that ice,” but “what we’re starting to see is that winter ice is not recovering any more… We see that at the end of November we have two-million square kilometres less ice than we should have in a typical year” (ABC, 2007c). </p></blockquote>
<p>And now studies say King Penguin is having trouble. Waters are getting a bit too warm for his food to survive, apparently. (He&#8217;s at the other end of the earth, you know.) I just can&#8217;t go there. Bears and Penguins, Penguins and Bears&#8230;the more you know, the more you should care.</p>
<p>What is now even more disturbing is that the Arctic Sea melt could kick start Greenland, even without &#8220;without adding one more tonne of human emissions to the atmosphere.&#8221; Tipping points may be like close-standing dominoes. Touch one; touch all.</p>
<p>Economically, we seem to have arranged another precarious line of dominoes.</p>
<p>Municipal bonds are the latest. What will we learn from all this?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080213/ap_on_el_pr/campaign_rdp">Jerry Estill</a> reports that President Bush, Senator McCain, and Senator Clinton are partly responsible for our current economic woes because they failed to actively oppose the invasion of Iraq:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a Washington where politicians like John McCain and Hillary Clinton voted for a war in Iraq that should&#8217;ve never been authorized and never been waged &#8211; a war that is costing us thousands of precious lives and billions of dollars a week&#8221; that could be used on infrastructure, job training and health care.</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree that there was a huge opportunity cost in diverting as many resources as we did to our occupation of Iraq and these resources could have been directed towards infrastructure, job training and health care.  But to say an increase in government spending leads to a fall in aggregate demand strikes me as quite odd.  </p>
<p>The usual line of reasoning for this theme seems to be some sort of indirect impact on residential investment, which of course has plummeted.  But those who emphasize the residential investment angle have a couple of different – and perhaps contradictory – channels.  Some would argue that the Federal Reserve kept interest rates too low, which lead to over-investment ala the <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/06/25/amid-financial-excess-a-revival-of-austrian-economics-in-basel">Austrian school of economics</a>.  But trying to tie this to what Senator Obama said has the following problem – fiscal stimulus tends to increase interest rates.  </p>
<p>Then again – the housing bubble burst followed a period where the Federal Reserve did increase interest rates.  When the Federal Reserve was increasing interest rates, however, the thought was it needed to do so to avoid demand pull inflation.  The continued fiscal folly of the Bush Administration was sort of like the 1981 fiscal folly under President Reagan.  And the Federal Reserve slammed on the monetary brakes back then very hard, which led to the 1982 recession.  Maybe we are watching a repeat of this horrific mix between fiscal stimulus and tight money.  If we are, there are lots of things adding to the fiscal folly besides the stupid war, such as those tax cuts that John McCain now loves and that prescription drug benefit that Bush keeps bragging out.  </p>
<p>With all of this said – Obama’s rhetoric here strikes me as a real stretch!  After all, ending the war today and lowering defense spending (which I’d support) would reduce aggregate demand.</p>

                                <p>This post is by Sammy&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-roddreher_08edi.ART.State.Edition1.43a648c.html">This</a> editorial reflects the angst often expressed on this blog, only it&#8217;s from the conservative side:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conservatives have to come to terms with the fact that capitalism, in its current form, undermines not only the virtues necessary to the kind of society conservatives claim to want, but ultimately risks subverting itself.</p>
<p>Capitalism is an ingenious system for increasing material prosperity. It succeeded historically because the free market is the most rational device for meeting human wants and needs. It also thrived because it rewarded creativity and industriousness, and encouraged both qualities. And the most prosperous people under capitalism tended to be those who understood the value of self-denial and delayed gratification.</p>
<p>Today, however, capitalism is defined not by a producer mentality but by a consumer ethos. The prosperity we see is in some respects a mirage, purchased with a credit card. According to U.S. government statistics, the personal savings rate recently dipped into negative territory for the first time since 1933. Consumers are buying more and more stuff we can&#8217;t afford. When bills come due, the whole pyramid scheme stands to collapse.</p>
<p>Our consumerist economy depends on people&#8217;s inability to discipline their consumption. The best consumer sees no reason why he shouldn&#8217;t have what he wants, right now. The best consumer, in other words, exists in a perpetual state of childishness. </p></blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of ancient Rome:</p>
<blockquote><p>Democracy requires virtue. So does a healthy capitalism. A nation that cannot govern its own appetites will, in time, be unable to govern itself. An economy that divorces economic activity from the restraining virtues that make for good stewardship will implode. </p></blockquote>
<p>Finally:</p>
<blockquote><p>Socialism is not the answer. But we can&#8217;t pretend that our prosperity does not present us with serious civic problems. <em>Consumer capitalism contains within its unfolding dynamic the seeds of its own destruction, to say nothing of the way it chews up traditional loyalties to faith, family, community and place.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>(italics mine)</p>
<p>You guys think big government is the answer.  I disagree.  But as of now, I don&#8217;t have a different answer.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This one was by Sammy.</p>
<p>Cactus here&#8230; I can&#8217;t speak for anyone else, but here&#8217;s what I think is the answer:</p>
<p>Enforcement of laws.  No matter how big or small one thinks the government should be, it is hard to argue that setting the rules and enforcing them is the domain of anyone but the government.  We give a monopoly on violence to the government in order that there be rules to make an orderly society possible.</p>
<p>Such enforcement has to extend to everyone.  That includes those in government, and those who come from the right families, have fatter wallets, or are celebrities.  When average people see that there are protected classes that can cheat with impunity, their interest in maintaining the status quo by not cheating themselves goes away.</p>
<p>Such enforcement requires both punishment and mercy.  But if the mercy is reserved for protected classes, the system breaks down.</p>
<p>But as I write this, it occurs to me that there is something else that is needed, and it doesn&#8217;t come from government (though a leader might inspire it), it comes from us.  See, there are many things that are not illegal, but which cause a lot of damage.  There are the actions of the hacks and bamboozlers &#8211; something I often rant about.  They lead us down paths we should not take, paths that even the hacks and the bamboozlers knew we shouldn&#8217;t take.  There are liars and the rumor-mongers, whose slander creates the impression of injustice even when that injustice does not exist.  And then there are the folks dedicated to finding technicalities around the rules, subverting the purpose and all of the benefits of a civilized society.  </p>
<p>These things cannot be combated by government.  They have to be combated by us.  We have to encourage honest disagreement, and yet still turn our backs in disgust when the Harvard professor or the business school dean or the senior fellow or the TV show host walk into a room because grifters cannot be tolerated.  We have to encourage the spread of information, but still turn, even to those with whom we generally agree, and say, &#8220;No sir, much as I would like to believe it, your facts are wrong&#8221; when they repeat a falsehood, whether on purpose or inadvertently.  These are things we all have to do, and all fail to do often enough.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Correction&#8230; added the word &#8220;not&#8221; before &#8220;illegal.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Bruno Behrend provides a link to an MP3 file of his radio show yesterday in which I was a guest.  I haven&#8217;t heard it yet, and I&#8217;m curious how I did, never having been on the radio before.</p>
<p>Here it is:</p>
<p><a rel="enclosure" href="http://www.hipcast.com/export/P396482fbc7fe7ea04fa25a3eabe38367YVB8R1R%3Cbr%20/%3EEYmR3.mp3">MP3 File</a></p>
<p>A reminder:  I think I was treated very fairly.  Some Angry Bear readers who heard the broadcast agreed.  So I will let you know if I&#8217;m on again, or if he covers economic issues again, which he clearly intends to do.</p>
<p>Again, his show is (generally) on Mondays and Fridays and can be heard <a href="http://1220wkrs.com/pages/93518.php">here</a> and his blog is <a href="http://www.extremewisdom.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Corrected broken link to Extreme Wisdom.</p>

                                <p>I listened to John McCain’s Virginia victory speech last night as was thoroughly disgusted at its dishonesty and neo-McCarthyism.  If anyone has a transcript, please let me know.  In the meantime, we have what <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/02/dog-eating-jew.html">Brad DeLong</a> had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>A correspondent tells me that beside John McCain as he gave his Virginia victory speech was the dog-eating Jew-counter himself, Fred Malek &#8211; the man who accepted from Richard Nixon the mission of trying to identify and fire the nest of Jews working in the Bureau of Labor Statistics whom Nixon was sure were plotting to undermine him.  That&#8217;s the modern Republican Party: paranoia, bigotry, and a craven eagerness to do everything possible to assist the criminal enterprises of your highers-up &#8211; it&#8217;s not a disqualification, it&#8217;s a lifestyle. Shut down the Republican Party as quickly as possible. America needs an honorable opposition party to face off against the Democrats.</p></blockquote>
<p>My sentiments exactly!</p>
<p>Update: I found a <a href="http://youdecide08.foxnews.com/2008/02/12/raw-data-text-of-mccains-potomac-primaries-victory-speech">text</a> of McCain’s speech.  Let’s review.  </p>
<blockquote><p>They will promise a new approach to governing, but offer only the policies of a political orthodoxy that insists the solution to government’s failures is to simply make it bigger. They will appeal to our dreams of a better future for ourselves, our families and our country, but they would take from us more of the wealth we have earned to build those dreams and assure us that government is better able than we are to make decisions about our future for us.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Republican Presidents have downsized the government?  Excuse me but this did not happen under Ronald Reagan.  It did happen under Bill Clinton.  George W. Bush increased the size of the government.  McCain either does not understand the facts or he’s being dishonest here. </p>
<blockquote><p>They will paint a picture of the world in which America’s mistakes are a greater threat to our security than the malevolent intentions of an enemy that despises us and our ideals; a world that can be made safer and more peaceful by placating our implacable foes and breaking faith with allies and the millions of people in this world for whom America, and the global progress of our ideals, has long been “the last, best hope of Earth.”  We will offer different ideas, based in a better understanding of the challenges we face, and the resolve to confront them with confidence in the strength and ideals of free people. We believe that Americans, not our detractors and certainly not our enemies, are on the right side of history. We trust in the strength, industry and goodness of the American people.</p></blockquote>
<p>McCain is still playing attacking Saddam Hussein was attacking Al Qaeda canard.  But the decision to depose Saddam Hussein played right into Osama bin Laden’s hands as it gave him what he failed to achieve with 9/11 – getting the US bogged down in an occupation of a Muslim nation.  To claim that the neocons have a “better understanding of the challenges we face” is ludicrous on its face.  McCain has yet to understand that the decision on 3/19/2003 was a colossal mistake.  </p>
<p>But when he accuses we Democrats of not recognizing that Al Qaeda is a threat and that we wish to placate these terrorists, he clearly has decided to be today’s version of Senator Joseph McCarthy.  The truth is that we Democrats – as noted by Senator Obama last night – would have devoted more resources in 2002 to going after bin Laden and his crew.  Alas, the Bush Administration diverted resources from Afghanistan and towards Iraq.  And of course, the invasion and occupation of Iraq has helped Al Qaeda immensely.  If McCain has been paying any attention to reality, he would know this.</p>

                                <p>As the CNN team was noting how well Senator Obama did today, Paul Begala suggested that Team Clinton needs to win over Edwards voters by adopting some of the Edwards populist themes in her speeches.  How prophetic as just a few minutes later, CNN cuts away to an El Paso, Texas speech by Senator Clinton.  It was an impressive little rally in which she made a lot of promises to the audience including a $9.50 minimum wage for full-time workers. </p>
<p>Something tells me that she’ll got a lot of criticism from the right who’ll say that a $9.50 an hour minimum wage will create a lot of unemployment.  OK – time to check some facts and turn the clock back 40 years (1968) when the nominal wage was a mere $1.60 an hour.  But it seems that the consumer price index in 2007 was 5.96 times the consumer price index in 1968 according to the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> (BLS).  So in 2007$, the real minimum wage was $9.53 an hour.  Besides, a President Clinton would not likely be signing any such bill until 2009 when the consumer price index will likely be 1.05 times what it was in 2007.  This implies a real minimum wage equal to only $9.05 an hour in 2007$ or 95% of the real minimum wage back in 1968.   </p>
<p>Before you wonder how high the unemployment rate jumped in 1968, be warn that BLS reports that it was only 3.5 percent or so back in 1968.  I’m not saying that a higher real minimum wage won’t create some market dislocations, but let’s be mindful of the actual evidence as we read the hype from the right.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23131149">AP</a> knows how to write a shock and awe lead:</p>
<blockquote><p>The federal budget deficit is running at a pace that is more than double last year’s imbalance through the first four months of the budget year.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this was for the four months from October to January with:</p>
<blockquote><p>For January, the surplus totaled $17.8 billion. That was down from a January 2007 surplus of $38.2 billion. The government’s books are often in surplus in January because it is a month when many individual taxpayers make a quarterly estimated payment.</p></blockquote>
<p>If this story was not already silly enough, AP reports what the White House is saying about future projected deficits:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the administration is projecting that the deficit for the current 2008 budget year will total $410 billion and decline only slightly to $407 billion in 2009, it projects a significant improvement after those years.  Bush’s budget said that the president’s goal of getting the budget back into balance in 2012, three years after he leaves office, is still achievable, forecasting a balance that year of $48 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, AP did say private forecasters called this unrealistic but it might have helped the reader know why if AP bothered to itemize all the assumptions one has to make to get to the rosy forecast – such as Bush not getting his way on making those tax cuts permanent.</p>

                                <p>Before 2100, are we on the brink of tipping some areas of the world into irreversible change? A new <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.pnas.org%03cgi%03doi%0310.1073%03pnas.0705414105">study</a>, bringing together research from scientists around the world, suggests that indeed we are. The study, “Tipping Elements in the Earth’s Climate System,” will soon appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science. The lead author, Professor Tim Lenton of the University of East Anglia and his colleagues have listed nine critical areas with an additional five that need more study or did not presently meet the criteria stated below.</p>
<blockquote><p>Human activities may have the potential to push components of the Earth system past critical states into qualitatively different modes of operation, implying large scale impacts on human and ecological systems.</p></blockquote>
<p>A “tipping element” is a sub continental area that can be “switched to a different state by small perturbations.”</p>
<p>In some cases, less than one degree of warming is necessary.</p>
<p>In some cases, once the tipping point is reached, transition to the new state will be abrupt and quick, even in terms of human life. Other tipping points may take centuries to complete; nonetheless, the effect on even our children and grandchildren will be considerable. For example, if Greenland passes its tipping point, even though it may take 300 plus years to complete the transition to a new state, our children, and grandchildren and we will experience the effects of that transition.</p>
<p>Tipping points had to meet the following criteria:
<ol>
<li>The parameters controlling the system had to be “transparently” combined into a single control parameter, e.g., given specified temperature rise. A slight, adverse change in the tipping element had to be enough to trigger the transition to a new state.</li>
<li>Human activities are interfering with the system such that decisions taken within a ‘‘political time horizon’’ can determine whether the tipping point is reached.</li>
<li>The time to observe the change and the time to trigger it lie within a time horizon with which we can deal. In other words, the tipping point cannot be so far in the future as to make present decisions seemingly irrelevant.</li>
<li>People care about the tipping element, e.g., Amazonian die-off, Greenland melting…. </li>
</ol>
<p>Below are the nine identifiable areas whose tipping points may occur before 2100. We may be closer to any or all of them than we would like to think.</p>
<ol>
<li>Disappearance of Arctic Summer Sea Ice—approximately 10 yrs to complete—is the most critically sensitive. Indeed, it may already have passed the tipping point. Because of the albedo effect, disappearance will accelerate global warming.</li>
<li>Melting of the Greenland Ice Sheet—approximately 300+ years to complete—is the most understandable for most. If the GIS becomes unstable, reaches its tipping point, then a sea rise of 2-7 meters is in the offing.</li>
<li>Collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet—more than 300 years to complete—has already seen sizable chunks of ice calf into the sea. Like the Greenland Ice Sheet, it will contribute substantially to sea rise: plus 5 meters.</li>
<li>Disruption of the Atlantic Thermohaline Circulation—approximately 100 years to complete. The ATC is the oceanic circulatory system, transporting heat, for example, northward, where dense, heavy, saltier water dives to bottom; then moves southward (The Gulf Stream is part of this system.) This circulation can be interrupted if enough fresh water from ice melt and rivers freshens/lightens northern waters so much that they are no longer heavy enough plunge to the bottom. For a good overview of how the current works worldwide, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation">Wiki</a>.<br />The ATC affects weather patterns around the world. One certain effect of its interruption is a cooling in Britain and elsewhere, to say nothing of affecting weather patterns worldwide. The study notes that the IPCC did not take into account fresh water run-on from the Greenland Ice Sheet. Consequently, the IPCC’s prediction of little effect on the ATC this century may not be correct.</li>
<li>Increase in El Nino—Southern Oscillation—approximately 100 years to complete (gradual). With more global warming, we may begin to experience a more “persistent” El Nino state, leading to more sustained droughts in Asia, northeast Australia, and elsewhere. Additionally, one of the world&#8217;s great fishing grounds of the western coast of South America may disappear. In short, both fishing and agricultural will certainly be affected.</li>
<li>Collapse of Indian Summer Monsoon—possibly less than a year to complete. The IPCC report did not show an “obvious” threshold this century, but the IPCC models did not adequately take into account “brown haze” and land use changes. That brown haze, which can be seen from space, is a direct result the rapid industrialization in Southeast Asia. Ironically, the rise in CO2 acts stabilizes the CISM, but the brown haze with its sulfate aerosols are destabilizing. If the Summer Monsoon ceases—or is significantly weaken—expect sustained droughts in India.</li>
<li>Greening of Sahara/Sahel because of changes in the West African Monsoon (WAM)—approximately ten years to complete. Ironically, this may be good news: a greening of the Sahara.</li>
<li>Dying of the Amazon Rain Forests—approximately 50 years to complete. A large fraction of precipitation in the Amazon is recycled. Even without increased global warming, if we continued deforestation, we may pass the tipping point. Once the tipping point is reach, the forest will no longer be able “to grow back.” Instead, it will simply wither away. The lungs of the world will be gasping with ever-drier air.</li>
<li>Dying of the Boreal Forests—approximately 50 years to complete. The huge Boreal forest encircle the polar regions, spanning large areas of Canada and Russia. Gone will the trees that can live only in this region of the world. With them, all the biodiversity with which they are associated.</li>
</ol>
<p>Five other tipping points were included in the report, but they did not receive real scrutiny because they did not, at this time, meet the criteria above.</p>
<p>The five were:
<ol>
<li>Disappearance of the Tundra, resulting in amplified warming.</li>
<li>Ocean anoxia, leading to marine mass extinction.</li>
<li>Melting of the permafrost, increasing CO2 and methane in the atmosphere.</li>
<li>Melting of frozen methane hydrates, amplified global warming, to say the least!</li>
<li>Formation of Antarctic Bottom Water, i.e., decreasing oceanic circulation, affecting the oceans ability to store carbon.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some may claim that we can handle these changes; in fact, they will put a positive gloss on some of them, Arctic Sea Ice Melt, for example. Suddenly we have a real Northwest Passage. Think of the benefits to a shorten trade route. But changes do not happen in a vacuum. Everything is connected. How will Arctic sea ice melt accelerate global warming, thus bring other tipping points closer?</p>
<p>I suspect we are entering a period of great uncertainty, one that will affect all of us, one that will touch every discipline and every life.</p>
<p>We are on the edge of a triple threat. The first is the economic mess with which we are now entangled. The second is the depletion of resources, especially oil. The third is global warming.</p>
<p>We do not have a stellar history of dealing with problems of such large magnitude. The subprime debacle is a good case in point. We reacted only when we could no longer avoid the issue. Rarely do we anticipate problems. Certainly, we should have anticipated the subprime mess. But our leaders are rather myopic folk. We chose them. They told us what we wanted to hear. We react to problems; we do not like to anticipate them. Our leaders do exactly as we want and expect them to do. They are us.</p>
<p>We also have difficulty seeing the conflict between rationality at the individual level and rationality at the collective level.</p>
<p>An individual makes rational decisions that improve only his lot. We applaud such decisions as long as we are not directly and immediately affected. We have enthroned such behavior as the touchstone as to how the market place should work: Each man&#8217;s greed will ultimately lead to the betterment of all.</p>
<p>Rational decisions at the individual level, however, may not be rational decisions at the collective level.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a company resists installing scrubbers or decides to dump its toxic wastes into a river or unprotected landfill. In terms of profitability, the company is making a rational decision. But if all companies did it, collectively it would be irrational.</p>
<p>The threat of global warming is going to challenge us collectively as nothing ever has.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/02/are-taxes-really-distortionary.html">Greg Mankiw</a> has put up a straw man argument in a reply to the other <a href="http://knzn.blogspot.com/2008/02/marginal-taxes-on-poor.html">vowel-less economist blogger</a>.  Greg clips this quote from KNZN:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve always been skeptical of the importance of the purported bad incentive effects of high marginal tax rates on high income earners.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then proceeds to tell us that there are incentive effects as he trashes “left-leaning economists”.  Note, however, that KNZN also said the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>I won&#8217;t go into the details now, but I don&#8217;t think the incentive effects are very strong &#8211; at least at tax rates close to current tax rates &#8211; and I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;re all bad.</p></blockquote>
<p>In defense of my fellow vowel-less left-leaning economist, permit me to go into details on four key points, which Greg just omits.  First, some distortions from the market solution might be efficiency improving.  As the founder of the Pigou Club, I think Greg would agree even if the <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/02/will-gop-ever-join-pigou-club.html">GOP has not joined his club</a>.</p>
<p>Secondly, we do not live in a Ron Paul world with a very small government.  The GOP in the last 28 years has only pretended to be in favor of a smaller tax base as it has supported large Federal (especially defense) budgets as well.  So the real policy question is not whether to raise taxes but whose taxes should be raised.  The GOP seems to favor taxing employment and consumption more than taxing capital income.  If differential taxes create distortions, the GOP should be called Distortions R Us.  In fact, the GOP often favors tax policies that tax different forms of capital income differently.  Now if that is not distortion creation, I’m not sure what is.</p>
<p>Thirdly, those incentive effects that do take us away from Pareto optimality may not be that devastating to some Benthamite maximum aggregate utility metric not to justify the policy’s attempt to have a fairer distribution of income.  Of course, a Dooh Nibor distortion that takes from the poor to give to the rich is something that this liberal would also oppose.  Funny thing, some GOP policies do exactly that.  </p>
<p>Lastly, I suspect KNZN’s main complaint – one which I share as does other left-leaning economists such as Brad DeLong – is the free lunch supply-side silliness that cutting tax rates sine spending cuts has larger incentive effects than crowding-out effects.  This is the real policy debate in 2008 as John McCain (as did Mitt Romney) want a larger defense budget but also lower tax rates.  To suggest this fiscal irresponsibility promotes faster growth is bad economics at best and dishonest at worse.</p>
<p>Mankiw has created a straw man to attack left-leaning economists unfairly.  I wish he’d engage in the real debate next time.</p>
