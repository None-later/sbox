                                <p>AB reader Henry Cobb is very concerned about <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/66db756a-de5d-11dc-9de3-0000779fd2ac,Authorised=false.html?_i_location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F66db756a-de5d-11dc-9de3-0000779fd2ac.html%3Fnclick_check%3D1&#038;_i_referer=http%3A%2F%2Fwilliampolley.com%2Fblog%2F&#038;nclick_check=1">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>US banks have been quietly borrowing massive amounts of money from the Federal Reserve in recent weeks by using a new measure the Fed introduced two months ago to help ease the credit crunch. The use of the Fed’s Term Auction Facility, which allows banks to borrow at relatively attractive rates against a wider range of their assets than previously permitted, saw borrowing of nearly $50bn of one-month funds from the Fed by mid-February.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2008/02/borrowing_on_th.html">Bill Polley</a> is less worried:</p>
<blockquote><p>In early fall we were hearing that banks were too scared of the stigma of borrowing at the discount window and that something had to be done to get them to step up. Remember this?  So it seems a little odd to get worked up about this now&#8211;except for the fact that the collateral requirements are less stringent than for open market operations. So yes, on the margin, this is less secure.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bill also notes, however, that the banks that allowed to borrow from the Term Auction Facility are generally in good condition. These banks could have easily borrowed from the ordinary discount window, but are likely shy in regards the possible “stigma” of doing so.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I’ve been told by someone whose source is his cousin that I’m behind the power curve since I have my doubts as to whether the surge is working as well as John McCain claims it is.  It seems I don’t know any generals personally but I can remember when <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR2007073100990.html">Admiral Mullen</a> trstifed before the Senate in route to becoming Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unless the Iraqi government takes advantage of the &#8220;breathing space&#8221; that U.S. forces are providing, Mullen said, &#8220;no amount of troops in no amount of time will make much of a difference.&#8221;  Testifying alongside Mullen was Marine Gen. James E. Cartwright, 57, the nominee to become vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs. He heads the U.S. Strategic Command.  In written responses to committee questions, Mullen warned that &#8220;there is no purely military solution in Iraq&#8221; and that the country&#8217;s politicians &#8220;need to view politics and democracy as more than just majority rule, winner-take-all, or a zero-sum game.&#8221; Absent that, he said, the United States will be forced to reevaluate its strategy … Mullen, who is the chief of naval operations, told the panel that the U.S. troop increase in Iraq &#8220;is giving our operational commanders the forces they needed to execute more effective tactics and improve security.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Security is better; not great, but better.&#8221; … Levin expressed skepticism that Iraqi politicians can take steps toward political reconciliation. They &#8220;remain frozen by their history,&#8221; he said. Levin added that the Iraqi parliament is &#8220;at a standstill,&#8221; with nearly every session since November adjourning because too few legislators showed up … Asked by Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) about the U.S. prospects for &#8220;winning&#8221; in Iraq, Mullen said: &#8220;Based on the lack of political reconciliation at the government level . . . I would be concerned about whether we&#8217;d be winning or not.&#8221; … In his written responses to committee questions, Mullen listed seven of &#8220;the most significant mistakes&#8221; made by the United States in Iraq. Among them, he cited Washington&#8217;s failure to &#8220;fully integrate all elements of U.S. national power in Iraq,&#8221; the failure to &#8220;establish an early and significant dialogue with neighboring countries,&#8221; the U.S. attempt to occupy the country with &#8220;an insufficient force,&#8221; the disbanding of the Iraqi army shortly after the 2003 U.S. invasion, and the pursuit of a de-Baathification process that &#8220;proved more divisive than helpful.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>We may have just begun getting more support from the tribal and other local power structures, but as far as I can tell – we have not made nearly enough progress in this respect.  And this Administration has turned its back on diplomacy with Iraq’s neighbors.  Maybe I’m no expert but Mullen is now the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  But what does he know?  After all – Movie Guy and his cousin are the true experts on Iraq.  </p>
<p>AB readers – forgive me but I really tire when know it alls call folks like Barkley Rosser ignorant.  Of course, Movie Guy didn’t call Barkley ignorant.  He attacked for posting what Barkley said.</p>

                                <p>My Econospeak colleague &#8211; <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/02/why-mccain-line-on-iraq-is-wrong.html">Barkley Rosser</a> &#8211; says the McCain line that the surge is working is quite wrong:</p>
<blockquote><p>John McCain will be pushing the line that the &#8220;surge has worked,&#8221; based on declines in attacks on US troops and declines in violence in Baghdad and al-Anbar Province, even as violence is again on the increase in some other parts of Iraq, and basic political and economic settlements remain unachieved. The problem is that neither of these declines in violence has had very much to do with an increase in the presence of US troops, although the case is stronger for Baghdad than for al-Anbar. In Baghdad the decline in violence would ultimately have happened because the main source of it was ethnic cleansing and the rise of sectarian segregation. This is now basically complete, with few integrated neighborhoods left and with many Sunnis fleeing both Baghdad and Iraq. A city that was 2/3 Shi&#8217;i, is now about 3/4 Shi&#8217;i, with the US effectively aiding this outcome.  The turning of tribal sheikhs against al-Qaeda in Iraq in al-Anbar Province has had nothing to do with increased US troops (although providing arms probably helped) and everything to do with al-Qaeda in Iraq stupidly killing sons of some of those sheikhs. Ironically, one of the biggest neocon hawks, Charles Krauthammer, has effectively admitted this. He criticized Dems in Congress for saying the 2006 election changed things by pointing out that this change of attitude had happened prior to the election, even as McCain and crew are claiming it came later in 2007 with the US troop surge. Not so. Bottom line is that the violence situation has been naturally self-stabilizing, making it much easier to engage in large-scale withdrawals of US troops without destabilizing Iraq beyond what it is anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>McCain also wants us to believe that if we leave soon that Al Qaeda will rule Iraq.   But the Shi&#8217;i despise Al Qaeda and the Sunni extremists have turned against Al Qaeda.  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/02/18/alqaeda.sunnis/index.html">CNN</a> is reporting that Al Qaeda has turned on these Sunnis:</p>
<blockquote><p>Video provided to CNN shows an al Qaeda in Iraq firing squad executing one-time allies &#8211; fellow Sunni extremists &#8211; who were not loyal enough to the terror organization, coalition military analysts said.  In the video provided by coalition military officials, armed men wearing masks are shown standing behind nine kneeling men, all of whom are wearing blindfolds or hoods with their hands presumably tied behind their backs. The video shows the men being executed.  &#8220;Al Qaeda in Iraq, which is foreign led and foreign dominated here inside Iraq, is killing off other Sunni groups that are certainly not supportive of the government of Iraq, currently, or of the foreign occupation, but are not sharing the same ideology that al Qaeda in Iraq has,&#8221; Rear Adm. Gregory Smith said. The video was recovered late last year during a raid on a compound near Samarra that was being used for killing and torture, a coalition official said. A number of documents &#8211; some found in the same raid &#8211; bolster the coalition notion that al Qaeda in Iraq is waging a violent campaign against its former allies, intelligence analysts said.</p></blockquote>
<p>So these former allies of Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda are at war with each other.  Why the hell do we need our soldiers in the middle of this mess?  As they knock off each other, the Shi&#8217;I becomes even more dominant in Iraq.  Time to declare victory and come home.  Alas, one party’s nominee is either too dumb to understand this or has decided to engage in the Bush-Cheney strategy of lying to us so we’ll be too scared to vote for anyone else.  Either way – John McCain shows himself less and less fit to be our next President with each passing day.</p>

                                <p>There are now accusations that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/18/us/politics/18video.html?_r=1&#038;ei=5088&#038;en=d1284eb8e2206b2b&#038;ex=1361077200&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss&#038;adxnnlx=1203379485-6GbXJdQPOdAcm0ZFGhve+Q">Obama may have committed plagiarism</a> in some of his speeches.  As I recall, a few decades ago Joe Biden&#8217;s presidential campaign came to an abrupt halt because of precisely that issue.  </p>
<p>There seems to be some evidence that McCain committed adultery back in 1979, and then there&#8217;s the Keating Five issue.  Then there&#8217;s Hillary, with a whole host of accusations, most imaginary but some funny stuff nevertheless.  (Think cattle futures for one example.)  </p>
<p>Its hard to imagine serious candidates for president having these, um, attributes, a few decades past.  This isn&#8217;t to say that candidates weren&#8217;t plagiarizers, adulterers, and crooks back in the day (so to speak).  Rather, the public at large was unaware of these traits and would not have voted for a candidate that was known to have them.  </p>
<p>So what has happened? Is it because, literally, everyone does it, and now we&#8217;re reaching a point where the press is efficient enough to obtain evidence?  Or is it because we just conclude that these are foibles that don&#8217;t matter?  Or is it because we&#8217;re willing to tolerate it as long as its by someone on our side (but we&#8217;re not willing to tolerate it from someone on the other side)?</p>

<p>Germany to rich tax cheats: We&#8217;ve found you.</p>
<p>After reading this <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/02/17/business/tax.php">International Herald Tribune article</a> today, I thought:  “Wouldn’t it be fun to have a real Law-and-Order President?” </p>
<blockquote><p> After an opening phase that bore all the hallmarks of a thriller novel, with payoffs to a mysterious informant who gave German spies a computer disc with incriminating banking data, a tax evasion investigation went nationwide over the weekend. Prosecutors are now nearly certain that they can obtain convictions of hundreds of wealthy tax cheats and blow the lid off of Liechtenstein&#8217;s role in the scams.</p>
<p>The bombshell over the massive tax evasion investigation has outraged Germans and has amplified skepticism about business-friendly economic reforms advocated by Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p>
<p>Indeed, evidence that Germany&#8217;s moneyed big shots hid their cash in Liechtenstein is giving rise to a new narrative in German politics: the betrayal of the elites, who have spent much of the past decade calling for painful reform of the welfare state, even as they avoided paying their fair share.</p>
<p>&#8220;The political implications of this are going to be great,&#8221; said John Kornblum, a former American ambassador to Germany who is a banker here. &#8220;In the U.S., we send people off to prison and say, &#8216;good riddance,&#8217; but it doesn&#8217;t actually shake people&#8217;s belief in the system. Here, it does.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I beg to differ from the former American ambassador quoted above.  The American public’s belief is already shaken.</p>
<p>After years of fostering a culture of pathetic cowardice among top management at the IRS, we could do with some vigorous public enforcement of our tax system, especially among the high rollers who call the shots in America.  That is irrespective of what tax rates we collectively decide upon, or how simple or complex we make our tax system. </p>
<p>A good step in the right direction would be a three-year ban on IRS executives, attorneys, and managers from engaging in private tax defense work for law firms, accounting firms, and corporations.  That would reduce the “cashing in” on special relationships and the incentive to slant tax regulations and decisions while still on the public payroll.</p>

                                <p>I read <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=MTM0N2UxNTg5MzdmNGU3ODBjNGIwMDAyZTRlZWUxNTA=">this</a> at Corner just now (a man&#8217;s gotta take a break for lunch and there&#8217;s only one place to go for stuff that&#8217;s reliably funny):</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m going to have to wait to see Expelled before making a final judgment about agendas—hidden, shifty, or otherwise—but I have to say I continue to be troubled by the fervency of anti-ID commentary. I don&#8217;t have a dog in this fight—well, maybe a small poodle regarding the misuse of Darwinian concepts in social science and politics by the so-called &#8220;Progressives&#8221; 100 years ago&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>And then there&#8217;s this:</p>
<blockquote><p>But what exactly is the real world threat from ID people in the academy? (Or elsewhere?) Is there a technical issue, like stem cell research, where the ID argument is relevant? Is ID really the scientific equivalent of Naziism or Communism, which should rightly be proscribed from a faculty and curriculum? I have to agree with Ben Stein in the trailer that people who are confident in their views should not feel threatened by heterodox views.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wonderful.  I understand that at one point, people thought the earth sits on top of a giant turtle shell.  For the heck of it, let&#8217;s assume its true.  Here&#8217;s the way I think it works&#8230;  the giant turtle (note &#8211; I&#8217;m not naming the giant turtle, so this is not religion or mythology!) is actually very smart, and he knows how to do his job and still avoid detection by satellites or telescopes or anything else.  In addition, while it may look like the earth rotates around the sun, and the solar system around the galactic center, etc., its all because the giant turtle is making it look that way.  In reality, he is moving the sun and the moon and the other celestial bodies around in a way that makes it seem like the earth is moving through the solar system, and the rest of the galaxy doesn&#8217;t really exist&#8230;  but the giant turtle induces hallucinations in us to make us feel they&#8217;re there.  </p>
<p>Now, can anyone think of any problems with giving this equal time?  After all, it doesn&#8217;t affect the way people do science at all.  The giant turtle is trying to fake a system that behaves a certain way, and as long as we are able to noodle out that certain way, we will know what is going on.  It doesn&#8217;t matter whether we spot the underlying fraud by the giant turtle or not.  </p>
<p>I might add that we can apply the giant turtle theory (again, this is different from the Giant Spaghetti Monster theory &#8211; we haven&#8217;t named the giant turtle) to medicine, physics, engineering, architecture, or even economics.  So, who&#8217;s with me?</p>

                                <p>What do you think of a job that use to pay $13/hr, three years latter paying that same person now $11/hour? What do you think of that same job having other people being paid $9.56/hr.</p>
<p>It is a union hospital job cleaning rooms after the patient goes home. Cleaning as in washing walls, floor, beds, etc. It includes doing “trash and linen”; collecting the bags of linen and throwing them into a cage that gets piled high, throwing trash into a dumpster but, not on a regular bases. They have a young man for that. Just one man for the heavy work during the week. He&#8217;s on vacation. They have another male, but only on weekends (works 2 jobs, 49 yrs old). He&#8217;s had enough. He&#8217;s leaving.</p>
<p>They are not allowed to strike as they are considered essential to the operations. The company can not keep help, especially male help.</p>
<p>We hear about people having downsized their incomes when they have to make a change of job, but this is a downsizing within the same employment. How did this happen? The hospital outsourced the maintenance and then the company was sold&#8230;not to an outside the nation company.</p>
<p>My brother-in-law use to earn $80,000/yr. They cut his job. He ended up working for a company that filled a contract that a second company had for a third company who outsourced the department to the second company. He was paid $45,000/yr, was part of a team of 5 who replaced 15 people who were all making what he use to make.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s time we start understanding that “outsourcing” is not just a process of moving a job out of the country. It is also a shell game within the country.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0208/8564.html">Jeffrey Ressner</a> got to hang out at the Beverly Wilshire Hotel as he covered the groundwork for the next round of the GOP smear machine:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plenty of lowbrow Hillary Rodham Clinton jokes were tossed around at the three-day event, but of highest concern was the notion of Obama seizing the Oval Office in a contest against presumptive GOP nominee John McCain &#8230; “We [conservatives] believe capitalism isn’t a dirty word,” he said. “If you’ve seen Daniel Day Lewis’ portrayal of a greedy, sinister oilman in ‘There Will Be Blood,’ it’s just another example of the Hollywood left’s contempt for capitalism. “People have called Hollywood conservatives ‘the new gays,’ but I don’t think that’s necessarily the case,” Berg contended. “The gays have been accepted in Hollywood for years. They’ve long been out of the closet. In fact, they’re fixing up the closet, decorating it, and it looks nice, actually.” Berg centered his talk around the “unintended consequences” of the recent Writers Guild of America strike against networks and studios, which ended last week. Berg placed blame on the WGA’s “radical” negotiators, with writers earning six-figure salaries casting themselves as “poor, exploited, downtrodden” workers, “acting like it’s 1957” and they were UAW members trying to get back on the assembly line building Corvettes. “When the writers went on strike Nov. 5, they entrusted their futures to a leadership that essentially believes Karl Marx is still relevant,” he said. “This was a revolution against The Man.” … “The WGA cut a side deal with David Letterman but not with our show,” he recalled. “We had to go back to work as the No. 4 network with no writers and no stars. Actors would not cross the line. I didn’t read this anywhere, but they were threatened with blackballing if they crossed the line to do our shows” — ironic, he says, since he believes Hollywood is “obsessed” with the 1950s blacklisting era of Joseph McCarthy. “The true threat of McCarthyism,” he says, “is coming from the left.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Just lovely.  Hollywood is a bunch of gays with contempt for capitalism and a victory for labor is labeled both Marxism and McCarthyism.  But the main point of this story is how the GOP is gearing up to smear Senator Obama:</p>
<blockquote><p>Focusing on Barack Obama’s “inexperience” and “undisciplined messaging” are two ways to ensure that the senator from Illinois doesn’t get to be president, according to honchos at the Republican National Committee. Big RNC contributors got an earful this weekend about methods the GOP will use to battle the Democrats for control of the White House this fall, as well as other initiatives central to the conservative cause … RNC Chairman Duncan as well as Co-Chairman Jo Ann Davidson opened the Sunday session with a Power Point presentation outlining five main strategic attacks against the Obama candidacy. A Politico reporter witnessed the document, but not the presentation. The first called for pointing out what the GOP views as a seeming incongruity between Obama and the mantle of commander in chief. The second point harkened back to Obama’s days in the Illinois state Senate, noting how his “pattern of voting ‘present’ offers many openings to question his candidacy.” The third offered hope to the GOP faithful that “we can be confident in a campaign about issues.” A fourth bullet point relayed how “undisciplined messaging carries great risk,” while the fifth and final attack point stressed, “His greatest weakness is inexperience. He is not ready to be commander in chief. He is not ready to be president.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, George W. Bush had even less experience in 2000, but then making I’m offering them up another bullet point given how Bush is how totally screwed US foreign policy.  At least, Barack Obama understood back in 2002 that invading Iraq would be a colossal mistake.</p>
<p>But I think we’ve already seen a few examples of the Obama smear campaign over at the National Review in the form of <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YzliZThmMTA4YTM1NzlhN2E2MTdjZTQ1ZjhhZWQ0ZWQ">Krauthammer</a>, <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NWY3OWNhOTUxNWU2MjYwNzA4NWJiNzUwZTQwODkxZTY=">Charen</a>, and <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NGJkMWFmZmIxMDY0M2Q5NzdjN2I0ODU4MGFiNDdmNzA=">Steyn</a>.  Funny how easily Karl Rove can pull this crew’s strings!</p>

                                <p>Calculated Risk has graciously lent his template for our use, which I think is a winner. </p>
<p>There is no good time to change the old template to new template.  There is also no way to save the old comments as notified by haloscan and blogger.  The old Angry Bear html is also much too different from current languages to translate.</p>
<p>I apologize for the inconvenience. You can save your comments and put them back in after the change today.</p>
<p>Update:  Comments saved against all odds.</p>

                                <p>On January 10 Moody&#8217;s, in concert with the other main bond rating firm, Standard and Poor&#8217;s, gave the United States its top AAA credit rating. The terrorist blackmail threat came in the form of a demand by Moody&#8217;s that the U.S. government &#8220;reform&#8221; Social Security and Medicare: &#8220;In the very long term, the rating could come under pressure if reform of Medicare and Social Security is not carried out as these two programs are the largest threats to the long-term financial health of the United States and to the government&#8217;s Aaa rating.&#8221;</p>
<p>Steven Hess, Moody&#8217;s top analyst for the US economy spelled it out even more explicitly to the London Financial Times: &#8220;If no policy changes are made, in 10 years from now we would have to look very seriously at whether the US is still a triple-A creditThe US rating is the anchor of the world&#8217;s financial system. If you have a downgrade, you have a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>There seems to be more than a difference of opinion a la David Walker as well.  My question is why?  How do they interpret the problem as financial?</p>
