                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Paul Craig Roberts [former US Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; co-author (with Lawrence Stratton) of The Tyranny of Good Intentions]: <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/hotline/2008/01/padilla-trial-highlights-bush.php">writes</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The only case the DOJ was able to manufacture against Padilla was that he was a “terrorist-wannabe.” </p>
<p>Padilla was thus indicted on the Benthamite grounds that he might commit a terrorist act in the future. By the time Padilla went to trial, he had been demonized for years in the media as the “dirty bomb” terrorist. In the Washington Post, August 17, 2007, Peter Whoriskey described the Padilla jury as a patriotic jury that appeared in court with one row of jurors dressed in red, one in white, and one in blue. As Lawrence Stratton and I write in the new edition of The Tyranny of Good Intentions: “It was a jury primed to be psychologically and emotionally manipulated by federal prosecutors. No member of this jury was going to return home to accusations of letting off the “dirty bomber.”</p>
<p>The main “evidence” introduced against Padilla was an unrelated 10-year old video of Osama bin Laden, which served to arouse in jurors fear, anger, and disturbing memories of September 11.</p>
<p>The prosecutors also claimed to have a form that Padilla is alleged to have completed in 2000, prior to September 11, 2001, to attend an al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan. At that time Al Qaeda and the Taliban were fighting against a remnant of the Northern Alliance containing elements of the old Soviet regime to unify Afghanistan as an Islamic state. </p>
<p>Although it is far fetched that al Qaeda sent out applications to attend its training camps, any such application by Padilla predated the 9/11 attack and was related only to domestic affairs in Afghanistan. Any such application has no relevance to any act of terrorism.Padilla was convicted on all counts. </p>
<p>In handing down a <a href="http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/01/padilla-gets-17-year-prison-sentence-on.php">17-year sentence</a>, US District Judge Marcia Cooke denied the prosecutors’ request for a life sentence and observed: “There is no evidence that these defendants personally maimed, kidnapped or killed anyone in the United States or elsewhere.”Under Blackstonian law, the basis of the US Constitution, the Padilla case has no crime and no intent to commit a crime. </p>
<p>Judge Cooke vaguely recognized this, but US law has been pushed off its Blackstonian basis and is being reconstructed on a Benthamite basis.Benthamite law is the great ally of tyranny. It permits people to be arrested on the suspicion that they might commit a crime in the future, to be tortured, and to be held indefinitely.</p>

                                <p>So here&#8217;s <a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=OGVmNDEzYzhhMWYyM2MyMGEwZTQxYmEzMTg0NTY3Y2Y=">Larry Kudlow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It’s really a political issue. What will McCain and Romney do? They both want to expand the defense budget and the size of the military, as they should, to strengthen our national security in the War on Terror. But this, of course, costs money. Big money. President Reagan argued successfully in the 1980s that low tax rates reignite economic growth — growth that was absolutely essential to generate the resources necessary for a strong national-security posture.</p>
<p>Will McCain and Romney adopt the Reagan approach, or will they see higher tax rates as a tradeoff to a stronger military à la Eisenhower?</p>
<p>Cato’s Alan Reynolds worries that Sen. McCain will adopt an Ike-like policy, favoring high tax rates in order to fund a strong defense. Reagan’s view was completely different. In the battle for the heart and soul of the Republican party now happening on the campaign trail, will Ike win? Or will the Gipper?</p></blockquote>
<p>If I understand it correctly, what he is asking can be translated as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Will McCain or Romney pay for increased military spending by raising taxes, or will they wisely pay for increased military spending by cutting taxes?</p></blockquote>
<p>This is what passes for a fiscal conservative these days.  He&#8217;s like a dietitian telling you to compensate for your lack of exercise by increasing your consumption of cake.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/02/the-bush-budget.html">Brad</a> reads a report from <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&#038;sid=azGB.29vVkzA&#038;refer=us">Bloomberg</a> and then goes shrill.  First Bloomberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>President George W. Bush sent Congress a $3.1 trillion federal budget that trims Medicare and health care programs, boosts military spending and projects the deficit this year and next will hit near-record levels.</p></blockquote>
<p>Record deficit?  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=02&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=the_post_misreports_the_budget">Dean Baker</a> objects:</p>
<blockquote><p>This adjustment is also necessary in accessing the &#8220;record&#8221; $412 billion deficit in 2004. This deficit was equal to 3.6 percent of GDP. It is dwarfed by the deficit in 1983, which was equal to 6.0 percent of GDP. In fact, the deficits were larger relative to GDP in all but three years between 1982 and 1993.</p></blockquote>
<p>But then I had to note that the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/will-2009-deficit-match-2004-deficit.html">General Fund deficit</a> is much larger than the unified deficit.  We see Brad making the same argument:</p>
<blockquote><p>Their reference to &#8220;near-record levels&#8221; of the deficit doesn&#8217;t give a full and fair account of the magnitude of what can only be called a clown show. The headline deficit number ought to be $738 billion&#8211;we have a $331 billion Social Security surplus for 2009, and an honest and honorable administration would be using that surplus to pay down the government debt in order to get ready for the challenges that our aging population will pose for the federal budget over the next two generations. The headline number shouldn&#8217;t be 2.7% of GDP; it should be 4.8% of GDP. That is how far Bush fiscal policy is from what a prudent and responsible fiscal policy should be.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now that we have an actual Bush administration proposal in print&#8211;one that Republican senator Judd Gregg doesn&#8217;t think much of&#8211;it is time for an accountability moment. The Bush administration and its flacks and flunkies have long promised that the administration was going to &#8220;cut the deficit in half&#8221; by the time in left office in fisal 2009. The press by and large reported this straight&#8211;not pointing out that the &#8220;cut in half&#8221; was from a highballed projected peak deficit number that was artificially inflated in order to set the bar artificially low, not pointing out that such a deficit still left fiscal policy far from where it ought to be, and not pointing out that the Bushies&#8217; policies would produce such a reduction only if everything broke right and we had four uninterrupted years of macroeconomic good news.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brad ends up praising folks like Andrew Samwick and Bruce Bartlett and closes with:</p>
<blockquote><p>We want to run a budget that is in surplus during boom, in deficit during recession, that borrows in order to fund investments that benefit the future, and that runs surpluses and pays down debt in order to fund future expenditures that benefit today&#8217;s taxpayers. The Bushies have not done that.</p></blockquote>
<p>And if you listen to John McCain and Mitt Romney, they have no intention to listening to Bartlett, DeLong, and Samwick either.</p>

                                <p>The NBER comittee that officially determines the dates for recessions has a few favorite, or key indicators that it gives much more weight.</p>
<p>One of the indicators is real manufacturing and trade sales. Not many people pay much attention to it because it does not have its own press release and wall street traders do not bet on it.  It is an old Business Conditions Digest (BCD) that use to be published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.  But when they quit doing the BCD and the leading indicator the Conference Board took over responsibility of publishing this series because it is a component of the coincident  index.  But as the following chart it has a very good record of signaling recession turning points..</p>

<p>But something strange has been happening to this index over the last few months of 2007.<br />It has been improving and actually implies that growth may be accelerating, not slowing.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R6d1ZifixeI/AAAAAAAAAGs/1gtsw-VLJ04/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R6d1ZifixeI/AAAAAAAAAGs/1gtsw-VLJ04/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />One probable reason for the recent strength is that it includes exports, where growth is very strong.</p>
<p>But if you think the NBER is on the verge of declaring that we are entering a recession this indicator suggest otherwise.</p>

<p>When I first read <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-op-dustup28jan28,0,4766976.story">Steven Landburg</a> criticize proposals to prop up aggregate demand, which started with:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jason: I don&#8217;t think much of our audience will be familiar with Keynes&#8217; &#8220;General Theory,&#8221; so let me try to boil down your argument to everyday language</p></blockquote>
<p>I <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/01/does-steven-landsburg-believe-in.html">wrote</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Or is Steven saying such recessions do not occur in the first place? After all, he sees the problem not as an insufficiency of aggregate demand but as the need to let “unhealthy industries” adjust.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe Steven was thinking about an allegedly <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/energy-economics-cliff-may-must-be.html">respectable economist</a> named <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZWRmNmQ0NjhiZmZiNjYyYTg5NWEyZTFlMTg5ZjZkMjY=">Thomas Sowell</a> who does not appear to have read the General Theory:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are too many examples of government interventions that made things worse, the Great Depression of the 1930s being the most tragic. Those on the Left love to believe that the stock market crash of 1929 showed the failure of the free market and that the New Deal interventions in the 1930s saved the day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here we go again with the nonsense that FDR’s economic policies either caused a depression that preceded his Presidency by almost four years or that his policies made it worse.  There has been a lot of great economics written on this but apparently Sowell has not read this either.  But simply draw a graph given the propensity of the National Review nitwits to read anything of value.  The graph shows real GDP and real investment (billions of 2000$) from 1929 to 1940.  During the Hoover Administration, both fell dramatically.  I guess Sowell does not realize that real GDP rose dramatically during FDR’s first term.  Yes, we might have liked a faster recovery and we did have a 1937 recession.  But the usual rightwing spin that Sowell sort of echoes is that FDR’s policies spooked investors.  It does seem investment demand did cover quite remarkably after FDR became President – especially in light of this claim that his policies made things worse by spooking investors.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I think there should be universal coverage &#8211; clearly, other industrialized countries are managing to produce healthcare outcomes that are at least as good as those produced in the US at much lower costs.  And it could happen here too.  In recent decades the smallest increases in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/10/healthcare-cost-increases-by-president.html">real healthcare costs</a> have come under Clinton and Carter, the two presidents who actually talked about &#8220;socializing&#8221; medicine and took baby steps in that direction.  (I&#8217;m going to try to have another post in the next week or two on healthcare costs as a percentage of GDP.) </p>
<p>But honestly, it seems to me that requiring Americans to have health insurance is a distant second best to single payer.  There are many obvious problems with mandatory health insurance, but I was thinking of another, less obvious one.  In 2006, <a href="http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2007/March/20070303174902lnkais0.2752497.html">there were over 51.1 million international visitors</a>.  Would tourists be required to have insurance and turned away from hospitals if they didn&#8217;t?  What about people here for a year?  Do you require evidence of insurance before you let them into the country and how do you verify the card they gave you was actually issued by a health insurance company in the Congo or Nepal?</p>

<p>Putting People in Boxes – Pandora’s Solution is Grating My Nerves</p>
<p>Is a political “liberal” somebody who wants to play Robin Hood with other people’s money, or a “conservative” somebody who wants to stick his nose in your bedroom and listen to you whisper on your phone?  We have commercial businesses who sell beer through advertisements using talking frogs, and liqueurs through sultry dancing girls at a disco. </p>
<p>Labels, boxes, categories, &#8211; are these harmless shortcuts or are they obnoxious assumptions designed to produce conformity?  Our political parties and media pundits are happy with putting people in boxes, like the proverbial crippled Spanish-surname woman or the bible thumping black-hating redneck.  Whole campaigns are built around putting you in a box, or a political tribe, and appealing to your assumed prejudices. </p>
<p>I find it obnoxious, even if it works.  Since I’m closer to Democrats than Republicans this year, let me pick on the Democratic Party first.  I’m repelled by the ethnic and tribal categorization of Americans under the disguised battle cry of “multiculturalism” and “pluralistic politics.”  It’s Democrats who have introduced the idea of the “hyphenated American.”  African-Americans, Mexican-Americans, Irish-Americans, Jewish-Americans, working class-Americans, and so on and so on and so on.  This is one of the most divisive tactics that exists.  It splinters the very concept of the “united states” and the sense of a shared destiny and political ethos.</p>
<p>Republicans couch it a little differently, but aim to do the same thing.  Pro-life-Americans, never-surrender-Americans, patriotic-Americans, free-market-Americans, small-government-Americans.  And so on and so on.  These are terms that don’t merely describe, but which over time have trained Republicans and all Americans to have strong visceral reactions.  Competitors have been turned into enemies.  Old women spit out their hatred of “liberals” as they wait in doctors offices for treatments paid by Medicare.  I’ve heard them here in Tennessee.</p>
<p>After decades of constant efforts to splinter our society into “Us” or “Them”, and drive voters into unthinking tribal loyalty to one party or the other, is it any wonder that political debate has become a matter of irrational statements and slogans?  I have a theory.  My theory is that the fastest growing set of registered voters in the United States are listing themselves as Independent.  They’re sick of being taken for granted because of their color, or income, or gender, or religion, or for any other reason.  Otherwise why would John McCain and Barack Obama be such strong candidates this year?  They’re the two candidates who are LESS easily put into a standard box with the standard political labels slapped on them.</p>
<p>If you think that micro-targeting and micro-pandering to voters in the U.S. is a good idea, think about the other ethnic or religious tribal societies in the news today.  Afghanistan, Rwanda, Kenya, Iraq, Pakistan, Northern Ireland, Israel.  We keep on this same divisive path, we’ll have to take our machetes down to the polling place in November and chop our way into the voting booth.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>A little industry has arisen whose primary purpose is to throw gray dust into the facts surrounding global warming. I say &#8220;gray dust&#8221; purposively. It does not fool the thousands of scientists who are actually in the field, but it is enough to fool those with neither the time nor the ability to do any serious research.</p>
<p>Everyday, I read about these gnats; everyday I look at some of their stuff. In fact, I have a Google alert on climate change, a.k.a. global warming. The station survey is one of these gnats.</p>
<p>As I said in response to Co Rev&#8217;s piece, some adventurous souls are trying to diligently locate all the U.S. ground surface stations, especially those located near heat sinks.</p>
<p>Having lived in rural America&#8211;and Canada&#8211;, I know that if you tell one of the locals an anecdote about a temperature station being located on a tarmac or near an oven, he will delight in displaying his superior knowledge over all those high brow scientists. &#8220;Damn fools,&#8221; he will croak. &#8220;They couldn&#8217;t tell the difference between a tail and a teat.&#8221; He will be pleased with himself, of course.</p>
<p>He will also want to rant a bit about the government funding all those silly research projects. &#8220;Damn, who wants to know about bear genes, unless they plan on dating a bear.&#8221; Of course, politicians love those kind of quips. They play well. If a study does not put food on the table, it must be idiotic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, those quips serve the purposes of the big boys&#8211;coal and oil and others&#8211;who have some serious money on the line. If I have learned anything from reading as ecletically as I have it is this: All things are connected. Study the ant you may understand how swarms function in nature&#8230;and maybe in economics. No politician would ever fund a study that examined the size of finch beaks over a period of time. Yet that study of the beaks of the Galapogos finch gave us profound insight into how populations evolve as resources change. All things are connected. Unless you truly understand the nature of the study and its purpose, hold your fire.</p>
<p>When I read the station survey, I noticed that it did not include the oceans, the polar regions, the other continents. It was just a map of the contiguous U.S. Hell, most Americans think all those other places totally irrelevant anyway. But they are busy in Utah and elsewhere hunting down the stations. And, of course, the myriad weather balloons are totally discounted; anything out in the ocean they can&#8217;t swim to. I didn&#8217;t have to think much. No wonder when I Googled &#8220;surface station survey&#8221; I came up with very few hits. (Be sure to enclose the phrase in quotation marks.)<br />I do have a simple question for these fellows to chaw on: Are we measuring the polar regions accurately? Scientists do claim that the poles, especially the Arctic, have warmed much faster than the temperate latitudes. (That they have makes sense even to me: After all, global heat will dispersed. Heat will move north and south, heating those areas more rapidly.)</p>
<p>There has also been some movement of the deserts north. Flora and fauna are on the move. How about doing some studies of these? Put these energetic folk to work.</p>
<p>And what about the Arctic ice melt? Must be volcanoes acting up&#8230;or maybe aliens have planted giant heaters. I would love to see the people who hunt for flawed stations move to the Arctic and do some serious looking for flawed stations there.</p>
<p>When these issues are raised, deniers have a number of fall back positions: It&#8217;s the sun; it&#8217;s the Milanovitch cycles (they really should look at that one more closely); it&#8217;s water vapor, its hidden volcanic activity; the weather is colder today or this year. (&#8220;Damn we had a bad winter&#8230;and they talk about global warming! Stupid, scientists. They would milk a bull. And the government pays these guys to do this stuff. Damn rip off, I say!&#8221;)</p>
<p>They&#8217;re penultimate fallback position is the geological record. They talk about the Pleistocene, the Little Warming, or the Cretaceous as if they were old buddies. That really loses most everyone, except those scientists that actually do the studies. Some actually try to hold their own with scientists. I have watched them overplay their hand time and time again in RealClimate.</p>
<p>Their ultimate defense is the small handful of scientists that try to hold the line against global warming, Pielke Sr. for example. He is reputable. But are the exchanges between him and his numerous colleagues on the other side ever reported? Nope. Have they read those exchanges. Hmmmmm that might be asking for too much, eh? They&#8217;ve picked their racehorse and will stay with him through thick and thin.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the real problem: Knowledge. Most of us, including me, have limited in-depth knowledge with which to seriously add to the discussion. Yup, I am a rube, too&#8211;a local yokel. I do read a mite more&#8211;but there is so much to absorb that I know I would never pass a introductory college exam in any of the pertinent fields. I cannot remember that much.</p>
<p>I try to follow what the Chinese are up to; try to understand monolines and subprimes; I keep watching the WTO; I look under the covers to understand the connection among lobbyists, the government, and the military.</p>
<p>I try to follow the peak oil debate, the water shortage debate, the gasification of coal debate. I try to understand glacier melt (Himalayan,for example) and resulting flooding then desertification.</p>
<p>I try understand fish farming and its effects on wild fish. I read studies on the nitty gritty of pollution or the depletion of biodiversity, studies on how how warming will affect habitat (is it doing so already?)&#8230;there is simply no end to it. What about the principles of exponential growth in terms of energy? In terms of population? In terms of available resources? What about the economic principles about which we talk so much? How much in-depth knowledge of everything must I have in order to claim to know anything more than the tiniest sliver of how the world functions?</p>
<p>Remembering everything I read I cannot do. I go too fast. What I try to do is to read and evaluate critically&#8211;gather into my brain some working principles, some things that strike me as profoundly logical or true.I forget the details. If the study makes sense, especially in terms of others I have read, something in me is reinforced, made stronger.</p>
<p>What I want is an informed opinion, even if I can not remember all the details that went into forming that opinion.</p>
<p>If I really have to, I will go back and fill in those details. But I am not going to do that for the local rube or farm boy. I am certainly not going to do it for anyone who is not willing to do a modicum of research.</p>
<p>At times I have to rely on my innate intelligence, as limited as that may be. For example, that the polar regions should warm faster than the temperate zones strikes me as eminently reasonable. They are doing just that .I have read no serious studies contradicting that central fact.</p>
<p>That ice everywhere would be the first to go strikes me again as eminently reasonable. Yes, there may be places where ice or snow may be accumulating&#8211;but the global direction seems clear: Ice is disappearing.</p>
<p>Yes, I would expect the Himalayas to melt. And yes they are melting. That we are overfishing the oceans strikes me as a sane comment&#8211;especially when I see the size of those oceanic factories and when I know the hunger the growing billions of us have.</p>
<p>Yes, we are not paying attention to the pollution we leave in our wakes. That I have seen with my own eyes as well as having read about it in serious studies. We seem to be crazy housekeepers, running madly around after the fact, trying to clean up messes we made ten years ago instead of thinking ahead and planning.</p>
<p>Yes, there is no really effective market place without transparency and some kind of regulations. Transparency and regulations are Siamese twins: One comes with the other. I watched the subprime fiasco, the Enron joke. Yup, the principle is correct. Let&#8217;s grant the principle and argue the details.</p>
<p>Yes, the principle of evolution is not debatable. I have read enough on that score. (Yup, I do think the creationists are idiots in their denial. I am not going to be silent for fear of offending their god or religion. If they kept their silliness to themselves, I would have no problem. But that is not their purpose. The fact that our President and many other politicians share their belief is a sad commentary on the state of science, to say nothing about the level of our political discourse.)</p>
<p>Yes, I do think Malthus was correct; the principle is correct; the timing is the issue.</p>
<p>Yes, China does have a game plan for industrialization. Yes, the SWF&#8217;s do play a role; so does the currency peg; so does the suppression of labor reform. All of it makes sense in terms of China&#8217;s timetable.</p>
<p>And so it goes. I try not to be a rube and think local. I try not to be parachoial or to allow my wishes or my friends or my religion or my political affiliations to color my conclusions. In the end, I hope I am on the right track.</p>
<p>When pressed, I will acknowledge that I know little, that like all of us, I struggle with the candle I have and the limited time I have to hold it.   In the final analysis, the difference between me and the other rubes is marginal indeed.</p>
