                                                                    </div>

                                <p>A friend (we&#8217;ll call her &#8220;Heidi&#8221;) of the Ex-GF is leaving her husband.  The Ex-GF has taken it upon herself to help Heidi find an apartment, and has been scouring Craig&#8217;s List.  Now, we all make spelling mistakes and grammatical errors, but, well, here are excerpts of an ad she found and forwarded to me:</p>
<blockquote><p>single with banorama veiw for L.A. buglow house</p>
<p>nice clean with hard wood floor lots of closet and walking closet ,bright and suney, kitchen with breakfast eara has aveiw to downtown, has remdle bath room ,front yard ,backyard both gated nice and quiet please call me to show it in appot. Emy xxx-xxx-xxxx</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been scared of walking closets, not to mention banorama views in buglow houses.  But all kidding aside&#8230;  does it make sense to rent an apartment after seeing an ad like this?  I would imagine the ad is a signal that communication with the landlord would be problematic.</p>

                                <p>I watched the debate last night as did <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/179617.php">Josh Marshall</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>one of my big questions about this debate was Hillary Clinton&#8217;s lack of aggressiveness toward Barack Obama. I think it spoke very well of her on a number of levels &#8212; personally, as a potential leader, etc. She made her case on her merits and policies. But there is no mistaking the fact that by every metric and every visible trendline Barack Obama is in the process of winning the nomination. At least conventional political logic would dictate that she had no choice but to go after him just as she has been doing on the campaign trail. But she didn&#8217;t.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Josh is right, there were at least a couple of feisty parts of the debate.  Clinton and Obama did go at it over the health care reform issue, which was fine as this is an important policy difference.</p>
<p>But when John King asked about that faux plagiarism issue and Obama nailed it, Clinton <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/02/hillary_on_obamas_speeches_its.php">said</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Well, I think that if your candidacy is going to be about words, then they should be your own words. That’s I think a very simple proposition. And you know, lifting whole passages from someone else’s speeches is not change you can believe in &#8211; it’s change you can Xerox</p></blockquote>
<p>Clever, I guess and she is getting a lot of credit for a strong closing line but <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/179614.php">Josh Marshall</a> observes:</p>
<blockquote><p>I mentioned at the end of my debate blog that the pivot of Hillary&#8217;s powerful concluding remarks came from Bill Clinton&#8217;s 92 campaign. Clinton had various permutations to it back then. But TPM Reader CG found one example in this November 1992 article by Anna Quindlen &#8230;Clinton, 92: &#8220;The hits that I took in this election are nothing compared to the hits the people of this state and this country have been taking for a long time.&#8221; Hillary Clinton, tonight: &#8220;You know, the hits I’ve taken in life are nothing compared to what goes on every single day in the lives of people across our country.&#8221; Just to be 100% clear, there&#8217;s nothing in the least wrong with this. And it&#8217;s a great line. But I think it shows the silliness of the &#8216;plagiarism&#8217; charges based on a few borrowed lines. Politicians borrow good lines and catch-phrases. Happens all the time. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can hear Rush Limbaugh now – Hillary is a hypocrite.  She really needs to have her campaign drop this plagiarism nonsense as it really is petty.</p>

                                <p>From a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119144942897748150.html">poll by the WSJ/NBC </a>reported in October, 2007 comes:</p>
<p><em>While 60% of respondents said they want the next president and Congress to continue cutting taxes, 32% said it&#8217;s time for some tax increases on the wealthiest Americans to reduce the budget deficit and pay for health care.<br /></em><br />Can you imagine? They have started to figure out that their pocketbooks matter.</p>
<p><em>In a December 1999 Wall Street Journal-NBC poll, 37% of Republicans said trade deals had helped the U.S. and 31% said they had hurt, while 26% said they made no difference.<br />The new poll asked a broader but similar question. It posed two statements to voters. The first was, &#8220;Foreign trade has been good for the U.S. economy, because demand for U.S. products abroad has resulted in economic growth and jobs for Americans here at home and provided more choices for consumers.&#8221;<br />The second was, &#8220;Foreign trade has been bad for the U.S. economy, because imports from abroad have reduced demand for American-made goods, cost jobs here at home, and produced potentially unsafe products.&#8221;<br />Asked which statement came closer to their own view, 59% of Republicans named the second statement, while 32% pointed to the first.<br /></em><br />I don&#8217;t think these questions are the best framed.  They seem kind of load in that it states “foreign trade” instead of Free Trade, or NAFTA.  But, the qualifications I&#8217;m sure are what the people responded to.<br /><em></em><br />From <a href="http://www.timeinc.net/fortune/information/presscenter/fortune/press_releases/20080118_economysurvey.html">Fortune Magazine</a>, January, 2008:<br />This is a poll of the general public.</p>
<p><em>With much of the country worried about the state of the economy, many (67%) Americans say they now closely follow news about US trade policy with foreign countries. Americans see the current trade policy as a reason for the economic woes the US is currently facing.<br />Almost 7 in 10 (68%) Americans believe international trade benefits other countries more than it benefits the United States.<br />International trade is seen as having a largely negative impact on American workers (78% negative) and the Untied States as a whole (63%).<br />Eight in ten Americans (79%) feel the US Government has not done enough to help workers who have lost their jobs to increased foreign competition. A majority of Americans would support the following proposed policies aimed at helping workers who have lost their jobs to foreign competition and outsourcing:</em><br /><em>Policies with the greatest amount of support include: providing special training programs (90% support), providing tax incentives for companies to relocate to areas where workers have lost their jobs because of foreign imports (84%), allowing imports only from countries that ban child labor (82% support), and allowing imports from countries that meet certain clean air and water standards (78% support).<br />About two-thirds (64%) of Americans are willing to pay more to keep down foreign competition.</em></p>
<p>There is a disconnect in the above responses. 90% want training, but in another question about boosting the economy, 41% opposed extending unemployment benefits. Though 67% support public works projects. This shows me that the public has not made the connections between our current trade environment and the economy. But, how about that 64% would pay more to keep down foreign competition. Can you get a more patriotic response? I don&#8217;t think the Republican&#8217;s had this kind of patriotism in mind.</p>
<p>When it comes to China:<br /><em>Where a product is manufactured does not impact Americans&#8217; purchasing decisions except when that product is made in China.<br />Nearly three-in-five (57%) Americans are less likely to buy a product if it is made in China.<br />When products are manufactured in other areas, such as Eastern Europe (57%), Western Europe (55%), Canada (53%), India (52%), Africa (51%), Mexico (48%), Japan (47%), and South Korea (46%) nearly a majority say it doesn&#8217;t matter.<br /></em><br />I can &#8216;t imagine that people are specifically boycotting Chinese made goods. Walmart et al would be in trouble. I think this is more of a gut response.</p>
<p>Over all, the public is waking up and seems more sophisticated in their understanding than I believe the Beltway crowd is willing to accept.  But, I believe some work needs to be done so that they connect the dots of the US economy as a function of trade policy.  I would like to see a de-emphasis of the fear and a disconnecting of foreign trade equals free trade policy. I really don&#8217;t believe anyone is against trading, they just have a major problem with the current rules and the referees.</p>

                                <p>Kinsley entitled his take on the surge: <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/21/AR2008022101555.html">Defining Victory Downward</a> and you might wonder why he says the surge was not a success when you read this:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is now widely considered beyond dispute that Bush has won his gamble. The surge was a terrific success. Choose your metric: attacks on American soldiers, car bombs, civilian deaths, potholes. They&#8217;re all down, down, down. Lattes sold by street vendors are up. Performances of Shakespeare by local repertory companies have tripled. Skepticism seems like sour grapes. If you opposed the surge, you have two choices. One is to admit that you were wrong, wrong wrong. The other is to sound as if you resent all the good news and remain eager for disaster. Too many opponents of the war have chosen option two.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep – that does seem to be what the “surge is working” crowd has been saying.  But Kinsley reminds us:</p>
<blockquote><p>Why was President Bush&#8217;s decision more than a year ago to send another 30,000 troops to Iraq called &#8220;the surge&#8221;? I don&#8217;t know who invented this label, but the word &#8220;surge&#8221; evokes images of the sea: a wave that sweeps in, and then sweeps back out again. The second part was crucial. What made the surge different from your ordinary troop deployment was that it was temporary. In fact, the surge was presented as part of a larger plan for troop withdrawal. It was also, implicitly, part of a deal between Bush and the majority of Americans, who want out. The deal was: just let me have a few more soldiers to get Baghdad under control, and then everybody, or almost everybody, can pack up and come home &#8230; But we needn&#8217;t quarrel about all this, or deny the reality of the good news, to say that at the very least, the surge has not worked yet. The test is simple, and built into the concept of a surge: Has it allowed us to reduce troop levels to below where they were when it started? And the answer is no. In fact, President Bush laid down the standard of success when he announced the surge more than a year ago: &#8220;If we increase our support at this crucial moment, and help the Iraqis break the current cycle of violence, we can hasten the day our troops begin coming home.&#8221; At the time, there were about 130,000 American soldiers in Iraq. Bush proposed to add up to 20,000 more troops. Although Bush never made any official promises about a timetable, the surge was generally described as lasting six to eight months. By last summer the surge had actually added closer to 30,000 troops, making the total American troop count about 160,000. Today, there are still more than 150,000 American troops in Iraq. The official plan has been to get that number back down to 130,000 by July, and then to keep on going so that there would be about 100,000 American troops in Iraq by the time Bush leaves office. Just lately, though, General Petraeus has come up with another zen-like idea: he calls it a &#8220;pause.&#8221; And the administration has signed on, meaning that the total number of American troops in Iraq will remain at 130,000 for an undetermined period. So the best that we can hope for, in terms of American troops risking their lives in Iraq, is that there will be just as many in July &#8211; and probably in January, when Bush leaves office &#8211; as there were a year ago. The surge will have surged in and surged out, leaving us back where we started. Maybe the situation in Baghdad, or all of Iraq, will have improved. But apparently it won&#8217;t have improved enough to risk an actual reduction in the American troop commitment. And consider how modest the administration&#8217;s standard of success has become. Can there be any doubt that they would go for a reduction to 100,000 troops &#8211; and claim victory &#8211; if they had any confidence at all that the gains they brag about would hold at that level of support? The proper comparison isn&#8217;t to the situation a year ago. It&#8217;s to the situation before we got there. Imagine that you had been told in 2003 that when George W. Bush finished his second term, dozens of American soldiers and hundreds of Iraqis would be dying violently every month; that a major American goal would be getting the Iraqi government to temper its &#8220;debaathification&#8221; campaign so that Saddam Hussein&#8217;s former henchmen could start running things again (because they know how); and that &#8220;only&#8221; 100,000 American troops would be needed to sustain this equilibrium. You might have several words to describe this situation, but &#8220;success&#8221; would not be one of them.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I survived many years without cable.  I&#8217;ve always had a tv in the house, but it was for  watching dvds and, once a week, the Simpsons.  I figured if I wanted information about a breaking story that I couldn&#8217;t get from the radio or the net, it would be a big enough story that it would be on the local stations too.  </p>
<p>But once you get married, you compromise.  The Ex-GF wanted cable.  She likes to watch CSI.  And she likes to watch poker too.  So we have cable.</p>
<p>And on days like today, where its raining outside, I take advantage of it.  Instead of jogging, I bounce around indoors, and I generally do it with the tv on.  So I&#8217;ve made what is probably an obvious observation.  The channels are repeated.  You can see CSI on Spike TV (they&#8217;re the old ones, but they&#8217;re new to us).  Spike is on channel 76.  Its also on channel a hundred and something.  And its somewhere else too.  </p>
<p>Why?  (Forgive my ignorance about TV if the answer is obvious, but I really don&#8217;t know.  And I don&#8217;t think the reason is HDTV &#8211; two versions of a station would do it, but we seem to have three of several of them unless I&#8217;m missing something.)</p>

<p>In 2009, one of the following will be President of the U.S. 1) Hillary 2) Obama 3) McCain 4) Huckabee 5)Republican dark horse 5) Democratic dark horse</p>
<p>The above are merely examples. You may not wish to include either of them&#8211;or you may wish to rephrase them.</p>
<p>I will collect the questions and present them back to our readers. After I think all responses are in, I will tally those responses—and, in 2009, we will see how we did.</p>
<p>Submit questions on those areas of interest to you. The number of options following a question is up to you. I would suggest that you include options that cover the bases.</p>
<p>Of course, the questions we collectively submit will tell us a great deal about ourselves. If we miss areas that become pivotal, that will tell us something as well.</p>

<p>I ran across an excellent <a href="http://wcdb.us/unfinished-business-of-the-baby-boom-generation-640.html">video of a speech</a> by ex-Gov of Oregon Kitzhaber, who is also a medical doctor, on health care and the Baby Boomers. </p>
<p>It’s an eloquent description of the problem but Kitzhaber did not also offer a prescription for its cure &#8211; no magic bullet. </p>
<p>The good ex-Gov indicated a process of cure rather than something quick and simple, due to fear and procrastination and selfishness among the population.  Nobody stepped in to blow the whistle on the extravagance, excess, and speculative fevers of the 1920’s, either, which led to the Great Depression, and which was preventable.  Even FDR couldn’t bring America’s finest generation into WWII for years after the barbaric onslaught of Hitler on Europe had already begun.  We may simply be dealing with human nature rather than modern politics. </p>
<p>There may be some way to perfect America’s portion of mankind, which is after all the ideal of all utopian religions like democracy, Christianity, communism, and Islam.  First might be to engender some sense, however tenuous, of love for others.  Second, to engender some willingness to work without reward towards a higher goal than the selfish preoccupation of ordinary existence.   </p>
<p>It’s been done, or almost done, by movements like the Peace Corps, Americorps, Doctors without Borders, and the like.  Unfortunately, official organizations like the UN have rapidly devolved into bureaucratic structures where people work to make a living or take some advantage for themselves.  So the quasi-private model seems more robust, where people work for expenses and food, out of some desire to improve the human condition.  For the Baby Boomer generation, at least those among its members who already have some vested pension or means of personal support, look like the most likely targets.  They (we) have been the beneficiaries of the old system, and it’s obviously time to give back something.  Remember the old SCORE program of retired executives who helped small businesses to get started and solve problems?  That seemed to work fairly well, although limited in scope and purpose. </p>
<p>Whether some mass movement can overcome the obstacles of such a technically complex system such as medical care or energy sourcing is an unknown.  But I suspect if success is to be achieved, it will have to be the older generation who has the free time and accumulated knowledge who will have to carry out the work.</p>

<blockquote><p>*  First, would be the education of the public to having their medical records put into electronic form and accessible, a huge paranoia hurdle.   This has been offered before but met with a storm of legal wrangling.</p>
<p>* Second would be the manning of “checkup” or neighborhood clinics that review minor health complaints for little or nothing, without the need of health insurance.  That would move the ball on prevention and start reducing emergencies which are bankrupting the current system.  That’s in line with the “team vs. lone wolf” concept of Kitzhaber. </p>
<p>* Third would be an education of the public that good health is NOT equal to eternal life, which unrealistic expectation is fully engrained in Americans at this point, perhaps awed by the science they hear about or the blandishments of health care professionals who are always willing to go the extra mile and then some.  Adults who are not mentally impaired would be advised they are responsible for killing themselves with drugs and alcohol, for example, and that society has less responsibility for them than for those who change their behaviors.  </p>
<p>* Fourth would be the “commoditization” of the most common chronic problems of old age such as heart attacks, congestive heart failure, and organ failure cited by Kitzhaber.  Now such problems are emergency procedures often tailored and customized to individuals, and exacerbated by the self-adopted medical profession’s code of preserving human life at all costs.</p>
<p>* Fifth, that large monetary prizes of great prestige would reward successful medical research into cures and drugs that advance medical science, rather than having large corporations make massive profits from pharmaceuticals and devices, and which effectively create massive inefficiencies in medicine.  This would be in line with the “transition” of interested “stakeholders” to a new system, in which brilliance rather than marketing were rewarded.  All drug firms would become generic drug makers, for example.  One can meet weeping about the “demise of capitalism” in medicine by pointing out the great rewards going to the most brilliant and hardworking medical research teams, rather than to their corporate bureaucracies and passive shareholders.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was thinking yesterday about the theme of “change” in a totally different context.  The subjects were political campaigns, of people, and how they change over time in politics. I watched the following finale meeting of the 1992 Clinton campaign team of a decade and a half ago.  Carville knew a thing or two then, even if he and the man he elected have gotten lost since then.  See <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suAFYXTIh2k">The Glory Days</a>.</p>
<p>Got a better solution?</p>

                                <p>It does not get any funnier than <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/02/21/tucker-defense-2">this</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>But in reality, Carlson only “jumps to the defense” of fellow conservatives subject to allegations of impropriety. When President Clinton came under such allegations, Carlson beat the drums incessantly.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, we know Tucker Carlson is a hypocrite. But Tucker should check with <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/a_real_story.php">Matthew Yglesias</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Basically, in exchange for money and freebies, McCain sought to intervene in a federal regulatory process in favor of a company that had provided him with tens of thousands of dollars in cash and services. He could try to plead naiveté, but in light of the hot water he got into with the Keating Five affair, which had the exactly same structure, he clearly knew what he was doing and knew that it was wrong. Now whether or not some guy gets to buy some TV station in Pittsburgh or not isn&#8217;t a big deal as such, but it&#8217;s an example of how dubious McCain&#8217;s &#8220;straight talk&#8221; persona is. What&#8217;s more, I think we can all agree that the subversion of the basic functioning of the federal government (see, e.g., US Attorneys scandal, FEMA, etc.) has been a major problem during the Bush years and we see here that McCain takes a Bush-like attitude to the integrity of these processes.</p></blockquote>
<p>No Tucker – this story involved more than sex.</p>

                                <p>Bribes, payola, favor of the physical kind? Forget-about it. Just put the right person in the appropriate agency, preferably a person from the line of business the agency is to regulate. But, for extra insurance over the long haul, with a little luck of timing you get to fix the legal issue almost permanently: supreme court justices.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1203508155070">Justices Make it Tougher to Sue Makers of Medical Devices</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The case has significant implications for the $75 billion-a-year health care technology industry, whose products range from heart valves to toothbrushes. In a recent three-month span, federal regulators responded to over 100 safety problems regarding medical devices.</p>
<p>At issue before the Supreme Court was whether the estate of Charles Riegel could sue a company under state law over a device previously cleared for sale by federal regulators. State lawsuits are barred to the extent they would impose requirements that are different from federal requirements, said the ruling by Justice Antonin Scalia.</p>
<p>In dissent, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said that Congress never intended &#8220;a radical curtailment of state common-law lawsuits seeking compensation for injuries caused by defectively designed or labeled medical devices.&#8221;</p>
<p>But Scalia, in response, said, &#8220;It is not our job to speculate upon congressional motives.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Bush administration sided with industry, saying unfavorable state jury verdicts would compel companies to alter product designs or labels that had already gotten FDA approval. </p></blockquote>
<p>Hey, the government said it was good, what the f#$k is your problem?</p>
<p>Well, besides lending its self to a commentary of fascism , or that all the court is saying is that congress needs to do a more complete job, or that this represents another major blow for our constitution in that the government is failing to respond to the people, this is the manifestation of gamesmanship having fully ascended to our final stop gap measure. I forget who, but a commenter stated that law suits are the free market response to a lack of government regulation (I think I have it corret). If true, then the free market is truly dead and it has been killed by the most effective means of all; legal tic tac toe. We have been observing it in congress for years, with it most refined and skillfully played currently.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how you play it. I ask you a question literally: X. You respond literally: X. I say no, I was asking figuratively: O. Everyone knows that you can not win it. But, and it&#8217;s a big BUT, the purpose of this version of tic tac toe is not to win. It is to perpetually play the game. Just keep on blocking. It can be played with me asking a question: O, feeling you out. You respond: X. I think Ok and ask it again as you have responded: X. You respond: O.</p>
<p>Think I&#8217;m wrong? Then think about the hearings for the supreme court justices. Think about the AG performance concerning torture. Think about the definition of &#8220;is&#8221;.</p>
<p>This form of tic tac toe servers a very specific purpose. It forever releases the player from being responsible. You can never fully come to terms with a person who&#8217;s entire approach to life is to perpetually play tic tac toe because there is no way to win the game of tic tac toe. You can only move beyond them.  Stop playing the game.   For a society with a form of governance like ours, it means voting.  Voting not to approve those who do not answer the question as a responsible person.  Holding in contempt, etc.  For me it was a divorce.</p>
<p>updated to finish the last paragraph.</p>
