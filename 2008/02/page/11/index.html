You may recall <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/coberly-on-soecial-security.html">a great post by Coberly</a> on the subject, and it is one of the entries.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m running late right now so I haven&#8217;t read all of the others yet, but Coberly&#8217;s  isn&#8217;t the only post noting that there may be <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/coberly-on-soecial-security.html">less of a problem</a> than the public believes.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Sammy sends me a link to this at <a href="http://homeguide123.com/articles/what_median_home_prices_would_look_like_if_the_bubble_never_happened.html?ref=patrick.net">HomeGuide123</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Historically, median home prices and median incomes have always shared a close relationship. From the mid-1970s to 2001, the historical ratio of median housing value vs. median household income was consistently between 2.6 and 3.0.</p>
<p>What this essentially means is that median home prices were (on average) 2.8x the median household income for the last 30 years. Using this 2.8 formula, it is very easy to estimate what median home prices would be if the most recent bubble never happened.</p></blockquote>
<p>A graph follows, which doesn&#8217;t copy easily into blogger, but this is the data in it:</p>
<blockquote><p>U.S. Median Home Prices</p>
<p>Current Median*:  $208,400<br />What the Median Should Be:  $134,692<br />% Difference:  35%</p></blockquote>
<p>They also show the same information by region&#8230; and also one other thing:</p>
<blockquote><p>California Median Home Prices</p>
<p>Current Median*:  $402,000<br />What the Median Should Be:  $158,606<br />% Difference:  61%</p></blockquote>
<p>I haven&#8217;t checked through their figures but I assume they&#8217;re about right.  Also, I&#8217;m not sure that a ratio (2.8x in this case) should hold forever.  I would prefer if this is was true (being a non-owner at this time) and I kind of believe it.  But sometimes there are structural changes.  A longer mortgage, or much improved tax advantages of owning relative to renting (or borrowing relative to not borrowing) might change that expected ratio.  Other things that might do it:  laws limiting the amount of new homes that can be built, the likelihood that salaries will be shooting through the roof, or a good chance of very, very high inflation in the future. (In the latter case, you can take on a lot of debt, because a lot of debt will soon become a little debt.)  </p>
<p>Now, I don&#8217;t think we actually had one of those structural changes.  I do think for a while it looked like we had a structural change along a few different lines:</p>
<blockquote><p>1.  In the mid-90s (when home prices began rising, especially in California) people&#8217;s incomes were rising very rapidly. <br />2.  In the 00s, interest rates were kept very low.<br />3.  New debt instruments with somewhat magical properties appeared.</p></blockquote>
<p>Item 1 disappeared around 01, but it was replaced by item 2.  Item 2 is still around but it seems to have much less effect now, especially after many people&#8217;s real incomes have been essentially stagnant for several years.  Item 3 is disappearing as the magical properties of the new debt instruments were shown to constitute a mix of fraud and ignorance. </p>
<p>The only thing I can see added in is foreigners deciding that the next few years are a fine time to pick up Malibu beach front as there&#8217;s only so much of it.  But I don&#8217;t see that as being quite so big of an effect.  So unless there&#8217;s something missing, 2.8x seems as reasonable, in principle, as anything else.  But man, its hard to see that kind of a drop.</p>

                                <p>Here, <a href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/tax_me_more_fund_raises_little.php">Megan McArdle</a> notes that most people don&#8217;t like to pay taxes, which she takes to mean:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is what economists call &#8220;revealed preference&#8221;. What most of us are really in favor of is higher taxes on other people. If we wanted higher taxes on ourselves, we&#8217;d give the money to charity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually, considering that if given the option, most people would prefer not to pay any taxes at all, she could simply by cross out two words (or rather, one word, twice):  </p>
<blockquote><p>This is what economists call &#8220;revealed preference&#8221;. What most of us are really in favor of is <strike>higher</strike> taxes on other people. If we wanted <strike>higher</strike> taxes on ourselves, we&#8217;d give the money to charity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, the best case scenario that follows within a couple of years is that we&#8217;d be over-run by the Canadian hordes and forced to labor in their underground maple syrup mines.  </p>
<p>Or, as Matthew Yglesias <a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/silly_me_1.php">puts it</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would have thought this is what economists call a &#8220;collective action problem&#8221; that illustrates the necessity of taxation to finance public projects.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>David Brooks calls for a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/opinion/15brooks.html?em&#038;ex=1203310800&#038;en=838184d5c99deee8&#038;ei=5087%0A">Fresh Start Conservatism</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If I were advising the Republican nominee, this is one of the places I’d ask him to plant his flag. I’d ask him to call for a new human capital revolution, so that the U.S. could recapture the spirit of reforms like the Morrill Act of the 19th century, the high school movement of the early 20th century and the G.I. Bill after World War II.</p></blockquote>
<p>But this will add to government spending so how does Brooks propose to pay for this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Income taxes are not going to be coming down, but they need to stay where they are. As Edward Prescott has shown, higher taxes mean less work, and less work means less worker development.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://matthewyglesias.theatlantic.com/archives/2008/02/the_price_of_reform.php">Matthew Yglesias</a> discusses the details of the Brooks proposal and notes that it would “cost a lot of money”.  Matthew questions how we would we pay for this:</p>
<blockquote><p>These reform proposals are good idea, but they&#8217;re not an alternative to the traditional liberal notion that if you want better outcomes for kids you&#8217;re going to have to spend more money on kids. But higher taxes are off the table. So where does that leave us? You&#8217;d need to pare entitlements pretty severely just to stop the costs from rising. Are we cutting the defense budget instead of continuing on the path of large annual increases? I don&#8217;t want to dismiss the possibility out of hand; I&#8217;d certainly favor something like that. But does Brooks?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/02/new-york-time-2.html">Brad DeLong</a> went further:</p>
<blockquote><p>Everybody like me has a big problem with Brooks. He is certainly intelligent. But has he just not done his homework, and does he not know that his program doesn&#8217;t add up&#8211;is he just lazy? Or does he know very well that his proposals are b&#8212;s&#8212; and not care because he is not in the informing-the-public business but is instead playing some deep political game to try to get White House mess privileges for his friends? Or both?  And everybody like me has a big problem with an organization&#8211;like the New York Times&#8211;that gives a platform to Brooks. Don&#8217;t they have any ethics? Don&#8217;t they think they ought to be in the inform-the-public business? Yet there is not even a single phone call from an editor saying, &#8220;David, it&#8217;s your column, but this just doesn&#8217;t add up&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if we do not add to government spending in this way, we have a massive Federal deficit problem.  One could say all politicians make spending promises as if money just grows on trees.  But Brooks wants to pretend his is a journalist.  Does he even have a clue as to the long-term fiscal mess even without new government spending programs?  Now this education proposal may be an excellent idea – but let’s not kid ourselves.  Funding it will mean higher taxes.</p>

                                <p>“Taxation is in fact the most difficult function of government – and that against which their citizens are most apt to be refractory” Thomas Jefferson</p>
<p>First, I apologize for taking so long to get back to this. But&#8230;.I needed to work on some leads/songs (it&#8217;s not really work), get a new singer up to speed (hope this one stays around, it would be a first), deal with temporarily replacing my office manager (medical leave) and of course Valentines (the other business). Oh yeah, get some tax stuff done: W2&#8217;s, fed and state reports, blah, blah, blah.</p>
<p>Well Jeff Beck is playing Going Down, next is Situation on a compilation CD I made so&#8230;<br />I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/opus-1-second-movement-on-taxation.html">left off</a> with Mr. Avi-Yonah stating:<br />
<blockquote>A society is a community with a shared culture and shared interests that transcend the interests of its individual members and extend back to its historical roots and forward into its future. Thus, it is necessary to look for affirmative reasons for taxing the rich that are rooted in a broader social and historical understanding of the vital function of taxation in maintaining such a community over time.</p></blockquote>
<p>He list 3 common “excuses” shall we say, for answering the “why”.</p>
<p>A: That is where the money is. A presentation is made of the inequality numbers which I have taken every opportunity to put in front of the AB reader and then states:<br />
<blockquote>While these facts demonstrate the potential for large redistributive gains by increasing taxes at the very top of the income distribution, they also illustrate the importance of the rich to the economy and thus the potential cost of taxing them. Thus, any argument for taxing the rich must depend on more than mere income or wealth distribution numbers.</p></blockquote>
<p>I could take issue with the first sentence, but I agree, we have to depend on something more than “that&#8217;s where the money is”. Although, considering our nations debt and who has benefited from such, it makes a very strong number 2 at least if not a co-number one for the present.</p>
<p>B. “I Took All of It from Them”<br />
<blockquote>Another argument for taxing the rich can be summarized in department store mogul Edward Filene’s explanation of why he approved of the income tax: “Why shouldn’t the American people take half my money from me? I took all of it from them.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Getting beyond the simplicity of Edward Filene&#8217;s argument, Mr. Avi-Yonah presents this as a case of partnership between the individual&#8217;s contribution and the government&#8217;s contribution thus, taxation is the government receiving it&#8217;s share. Government also can do with it&#8217;s share as it want including giving it to others. The problems he sees with this are:<br />
<blockquote>First, since it is as focused on individual taxpayers as optimal tax theory, individual taxpayers can object that the partnership does not apply to them. Second, even if one accepts the partnership model, it is still unclear that it justifies progressive taxation of the rich rather than mere proportionate taxation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think he captures the error of the argument correctly here. Being that we are the government, we are all in a partnership. That one would argue the partnership does not apply is purely selfish want verses civic understanding and rightly should not be a serious consideration of argument. But as he notes, that still does not get us past the issue of progression over proportion.</p>
<p>C: “Money is the measuring rod of power.”<br />Mr. Avi-Yonah note it is a quote of Howard Hughes. He develops the argument that the rich go beyond acquiring money for consumption needs and wants and thus pursue wealth for it&#8217;s own sake.</p>
<blockquote><p>Wealth confers power beyond its consumption value.74 This power is economic, social, and political. The economic power of the rich derives primarily from their ability to use their wealth to invest in enterprises that employ thousands of people and can dominate large sectors of the economy. The social element derives from the knowledge other people have of the potential ability of the rich to use their wealth to acquire goods and to contribute to charities, which leads them to court such acquisitions and contributions even without such consumption taking place. Finally, the political power of the rich stems not just from their actual donations or their ability to finance runs for political office, but, more importantly, from politicians knowing that they have the excess funds to donate.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem as he views it is:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>As the eminent public finance economist Richard Musgrave has stated, a consumption tax is deficient because it “ assumes that consumption, current or future, is the only benefit that income provides. This overlooks the benefits derived from the accumulation and holding of wealth, whether in terms of security, power, or social standing.”</p>
<p>If this analysis is true, what does it imply for taxing the rich? From an optimal tax perspective, arguing that the rich derive added utility from their wealth that is not available to people for whom (because of their lesser means) money only has consumption value is an argument against taxing the rich. That is because any redistribution in the optimal tax model derives from its assumption of the declining marginal utility of money, and the “ riches mean power” model militates against this assumption.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A fine Catch 22.</p>
<p>I have stated that we have to ask: When is enough, enough? I ask this from a reference of consumption. Beyond that, the utility of further acquisition is no longer a need of material wants. It is a need of intangible wants. Considering my post on the<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html"> World Bank&#8217;s</a> finding that true wealth is from intangibles, a reason for progressive taxation has to address the intangible such as power.</p>
<p>Thus the reason for progressive taxation via some history as presented by Mr. Avi-Yonah:<br />
<blockquote>The American Revolution likewise was founded on the conception that while people have natural, Lockean liberal rights to their property, undue concentrations of private power and wealth should be discouraged.81 This view found its expression in the republican creed of civic humanism, which emphasized public virtue as a balance to private rights. A virtuous republic, the Framers believed, was to be free from concentrations of economic power that characterized England in the eighteenth century.82 Therefore, from the beginning of the Republic, federal and state legislators used taxation to restrict privilege and to “ affirm communal responsibilities, deepen citizenship, and demonstrate the fiscal virtues of a republican citizenry.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The idea of progressive taxation is part and parcel to achieving the ideals set out in our constitution in that our constitution is a formulation for assuring a disbursement of power. Though I wonder if in this “virtuous republic” we are finding the mantra of the Republican&#8217;s intrusion into one&#8217;s personal life, be it as usual a bastardized use by them.</p>
<p>There is a political lesson presented in the history of how we got our income tax that I was not aware of:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was another agenda at play as well in the early years of the federal income tax: the desire to use progressive taxation as a way to “ stave off more radical calls for industrial democracy.” 97 This explains why even some high-income Republican groups supported the Sixteenth Amendment.98 Andrew Mellon, Secretary of the Treasury in the 1920s and one of the wealthiest Americans, “ believed that keeping tax schedules graduated (albeit flatter) would mitigate radical demands for restructuring the capitalist system.” 9</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting. It was a time when those with the economic power were actually feeling threatened of a greater loss. This is a very important aspect of the debate that I don&#8217;t believe the citizenry appreciates. Perhaps if the citizenry knew that in the past they were able to instill the fear of greater loss, today the message of change would take on a more definitive tone than just “hope”.</p>
<p>Mr. Avi-Yonah summarized the need to be concerned with the inequality of income/wealth:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>There are three arguments why extreme concentrations of wealth are undemocratic.<br />The first two are obvious: In the American system of government, great wealth can buy political favors (often at minuscule expenditures) and finance runs for office (at somewhat greater but still quite limited costs).114 The third is more subtle—that vast inequality of wealth is socially destructive because it degrades relationships among people (cultural, social, and political) and eventually undermines the sense of community on which a democratic polity must rest.115 This argument is particularly true in a country like the United States, which is not bound together by ties of ethnicity, culture, or language.116</p>
<p>&#8230;that extreme concentrations of power resulting from extreme concentrations of wealth in the hands of private individuals who are unaccountable to the majority is an unhealthy phenomenon in a democracy. Such private individuals exercise degrees of power and influence that run counter to the ability of the government of the people to govern the country in accordance with the people’s wishes, as expressed in democratic elections.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As to where the responsibility belongs for presenting this argument:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>As Slemrod writes,</p>
<blockquote><p>The approach of mainstream modern public finance economics to these issues has been to accept, for the sake of argument, the right of government to redistribute income through the tax system (and other means); to sidestep the ethical arguments about assessing the value of a more equal distribution of economic outcomes; and toinstead investigate the implications of various value judgments for the design of the tax system.126</p></blockquote>
<p>Such an attitude to distributive issues may be fine for public finance economists, although it did not characterize the economics profession before the 1950s and still does not characterize some of it today.127 But it does not excuse the abdication of equity in favor of efficiency by most legal tax academics, especially in some of the elite law schools&#8230;It is time for legal tax academics to redress the balance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a professional, I can understand the argument to separate the two issues via 2 professions. The concept of a profession is that it is specialized. As a thinking person and a citizen, the public discussion should not allow the issue of efficiency to dominate one profession&#8217;s focus while the issue of equity dominates another profession. We have to assure both equity and efficiency are discussed and decided upon in order to stay true to the preamble of the Constitution and minimize Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s observation of the citizens response.</p>
<p>Part 1 is<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/opus-1-discussion-on-taxation.html"> here</a>.</p>
<p>Update: <br />In response to Dmerek question regarding what Thomas Jefferson thought:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I approved from the first moment of&#8230; the power of taxation [in the new Constitution]. I thought at first that [it] might have been limited. A little reflection soon convinced me it ought not to be.&#8221; &#8211;Thomas Jefferson to Francis Hopkinson, 1789. ME 7:300</p></blockquote>
<p>Being that President Jefferson believed in the will of the people and the people passed the 16th amendment, the issue becomes a question of how much for what expenditures and not whether we can tax.<br />There is much more on what President Jefferson <a href="http://etext.virginia.edu/jefferson/quotations/jeff1330.htm">had to say</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Beijing (AsiaNews/Agencies) &#8211; There is the danger of a full-blown diplomatic crisis with the exodus of many South Korean business owners, who are closing factories in China without paying their employees or their suppliers. Yesterday, Seoul asked Beijing to discuss a solution. It is likely that the South Korean government will cover part of the unpaid debts of its companies. According to the South China Morning Post, in Jiaozhou (Shandong) 103 of the 119 businesses that suddenly closed without paying are South Korean. </p>
<p>New taxes (from which foreign companies were exempted at first), greater pollution controls, the appreciation of the yuan, and the rise in labor costs (the new law recognises employees&#8217; rights to health insurance and severance pay) have made it less advantageous to maintain production in China. It is estimated that there are about 20,000 South Korean companies in the country, many of which have been producing at a loss for some time. </p>
<p>Unscrupulous businessmen have taken advantage of the lunar new year holiday, and their workers have found the factories closed after returning from their brief vacation. Many Hong Kong and Taiwanese companies are also closing their factories in China to move them elsewhere. It is expected that at least 10,000 factories will close this year in the region of the Pearl River Delta alone. </p>
<p>The 200 employees of the Dongguan Hongsheng Mould Factory, a Taiwanese company, also found the factory closed. &#8220;The boss&#8221;, comments one worker, &#8220;always withholds our money at the end of every year to force us to come back next year. We never thought the boss would shut the factory&#8221;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s the wild west&#8230;or rather&#8230;the wild, wild east.   A lot of stuff here on which to comment.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I had a neighbor once who was a member of an organization called the Upright Ostriches, which he explained to me was the non-violent wing of the Posse Comitatus.  The Posse Comitatus is a survivalist, anti-Federal government group, anti-tax, anti-Federal Reserve group of &#8220;Christian Identity&#8221; survivalists.  Every so often, enough of them are out jail at the same time to have a shootout with the FBI, at which point they get carted off to jail to begin the cycle again.  Hence, the need for a non-violent wing.</p>
<p>From what I could tell, the two organizations believed (more or less) that the world is run by two Jews in a cave somewhere.  I got the distinct impression that one of the Jews is Henry Kissinger &#8211; the other may or may not be George Soros.  (Despite the fact that he knew full well I was Jewish, he liked to share their literature with me and felt it was   important to bring me around to their cause&#8230; though presumably I&#8217;d have been hanged if I showed up a meeting.)  </p>
<p>Now, its easy to dismiss this as just another group of crazy people running around believing silly things.  Ditto UFOs, the Masons, and any number of other examples.  I&#8217;m generally pretty skeptical about such talk but&#8230; </p>
<p>Say that in 1985, I told you that the President&#8217;s National Security Advisor, Robert McFarlane, had told one of his people (a dude by the name of Michael Ledeen &#8211; yes, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/sotu-iraq-and-iran.html">Michael Ledeen</a>) to ask the Israelis to sell American missiles to Iran.  Yes, Iran.  </p>
<p>Now say I told you the Israelis went along with it, but after they made a few shipments, an airplane carrying 248 American service personnel crashed, and somehow this convinced the administration that more missiles had to be sent to Iran, and faster.  So Ollie North and McFarlane&#8217;s replacement, John Poindexter, decide to cut out the middle-man and start peddling missiles to Iran directly.  </p>
<p>One last piece of the story, squaring the circle so to speak.  The money from the sale of US property, namely missiles, was sent to help the Contras in Nicaragua.  Thus, both sides of the transaction violated US law.</p>
<p>Obviously, if I described something like the Iran Contra Affair before the story broke in 1987, you&#8217;d call me a nutjob.  Which raises the question&#8230; is there any way to tell when a conspiracy theory has any kernel of truth in it, or whether its a complete fabrication?</p>

                                <p>One of the criticisms levied by Democratic politicians of this God awful Iraq War is that the Bush Administration shortchanged our troops in terms of numbers and equipment.  If this war was nothing more than a political stunt designed to win the 2002 and 2004 elections, the charge of war on the cheap might also make sense as the GOP doesn’t want to go to Mr. and Mrs. America asking them to sacrifice in terms of having pay more taxes.  </p>
<p>I have shied away from making this charge, but <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/02/16/marines.mrap.ap/index.html">this AP story</a> appears to give tangible evidence for this allegation:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hundreds of U.S. Marines have been killed or injured by roadside bombs in Iraq because Marine Corps bureaucrats refused an urgent request in 2005 from battlefield commanders for blast-resistant vehicles, an internal military study concludes.  he study was written by a civilian Marine Corps official and obtained by The Associated Press.  It accuses the service of &#8220;gross mismanagement&#8221; that delayed deliveries of the mine-resistant, ambush-protected trucks for more than two years.  Cost was a driving factor in the decision to turn down the request for the MRAPs, according to the study. Stateside authorities saw the hulking vehicles, which can cost as much as a $1 million each, as a financial threat to programs aimed at developing lighter vehicles that were years from being fielded.</p></blockquote>
<p>The best way to avoid troop causalities would have never started this costly war.  Yes, Saddam Hussein might still be around but our real enemies – Al Qaeda and Iran – have flourished as a result of the stupid decision to invade Iraq.  We are therefore less safe not more safe.  But even if you are one of those who mistakenly believe that we needed to invade – how the hell does one defend this war on the cheap approach?</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Roger Ailes, not the one associated with Fox News, enjoys writing about Republican officials arrested.  His latest post is <a href="http://rogerailes.blogspot.com/2008_02_10_archive.html#1201363497164767828%231201363497164767828">this one</a>, about a member of the Maryland House of Delegates arrested as part of a child pornography investigation.  </p>
<p>Now, I can&#8217;t find a definitive list of Republicans and Democrats who have been arrested or convicted (and believe me, I looked far and wide for the book I&#8217;ve been working on), so what I&#8217;m about to write is based entirely on casual observation.  I may be dead wrong.</p>
<p>My impression is that while you see both Dem and Rep officials arrested for taking bribes, the &#8220;other reasons&#8221; Dems get in trouble are different than the &#8220;other reasons&#8221; Republicans get in trouble.  And bribes often aren&#8217;t such a bad thing&#8230;   you can rise to a high level position in the Democratic House of Republicans if you were caught on tape expressing some interest in being bribed in the Abscam scandal, or rise to a high level position in the Republican Senate and be your party&#8217;s nominee for President if you were one of the Keating Five.  Its all good.   </p>
<p>Maybe its my poor recollection, but the non-bribery-related criminal (or allegedly criminal or simply &#8220;poor judgment&#8221;) activity engaged in by Democratic officials tends to fall under the category of taking campaign contributions from shady characters.  Think Hsu, Al Gore&#8217;s lack of &#8220;controlling legal authority&#8221;, etc.  Reps tend to get snagged for sex-related issues &#8211; think Mark Foley or Larry Craig, but there are dozens are lesser known names, as Roger Ailes is frequently pointing out.</p>
<p>That isn&#8217;t to say there aren&#8217;t other things that get elected and non-elected high poo-bahs in trouble&#8230; for instance, there&#8217;s petty theft (think Claude Allen or Sandy Berger for recent examples), but it seems to be kinda rare.  And there are Dems that get in trouble for sexual issues (think Gary Hart and Bill Clinton for two high profile examples, even if neither was snagged for anything that was illegal) and Republicans that get in trouble for taking contributions from shady characters (look at the Giuliani and Romney campaigns for examples).  But Dem perps lean in one direction, and Rep perps lead in another.</p>
<p>And the interesting thing is what gets these perps in trouble is behavior that their party makes a big deal about being against.  Dems are for the little guy, but taking campaign contributions from big, shady characters is just about as un-little guy as it gets.  Republicans talk about morality all the time, but molesting a child is pretty far from moral behavior.  (I note that a large percentage of Reps with sex issues seem to involve homosexual activity, which of course is a big no-no to Reps in general.)</p>
<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s all I got on this subject.  Am I right about this?  If so, what&#8217;s the cause of it?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Corrections.  kf_in_dc and Bruce Webb pointed out that it was Mark Foley, not Foley that had the sex-related issues.  Michael Hendry suggested that with references to the Congress, use of the &#8220;Reps&#8221; as an abbreviation could be unclear (party or House?).</p>
