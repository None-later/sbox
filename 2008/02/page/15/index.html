                                <p>If you read the comments to Angry Bear posts, you may have noticed one of our commentators is Bruno Behrend, host of a talk radio show.  I&#8217;ll be appearing on his show today at around 10:08 Central Time to discuss the National Debt.  I&#8217;ve never been on the radio, so if you listen to the broadcast, which you can <a href="http://1220wkrs.com/pages/93518.php">here</a>, please excuse the stuttering, stammering, freezing up, crying and blubbering.  </p>
<p>Our goal is to do something a bit different with this broadcast &#8211; to discuss some real data.  Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.extremewisdom.com/?cat=11">Bruno assigning his listeners some homework</a> on his blog.  </p>
<p>I hope to have some graphs and a links to data up <a href="http://www.presidentialperformance.com/debt/index.html">here</a> later today.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I liked this line by <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=02&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=bad_debt_100_billion_400_billi">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Fortunately, the media do not hold economists responsible for their failures. The NYT gives us yet another example of non-accountability.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later in the same post, he adds:</p>
<blockquote><p>Being off by 300 percent might be considered a serious problem in other lines of work, but apparently not for economists.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have no problems with people being wrong, even spectacularly wrong&#8230; in situations which are outside our experience, and/or where the data is missing or incomplete.  But in situations where its not&#8230;  </p>
<p>I often quote <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">President Bush&#8217;s Economic Blueprint</a>, released in February of 2001:</p>
<blockquote><p>The President&#8217;s plan will accelerate this trend to record rates by retiring an historic $2 trillion in debt over the next 10 years. Under the President&#8217;s budget, the national debt will be only seven percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2011, its lowest share in more than 80 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then there are a couple charts, the first of which is this one:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R7GcA-lDTFI/AAAAAAAAA_k/erE0WATzIdk/s1600-h/Economic+Blueprint.gif"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R7GcA-lDTFI/AAAAAAAAA_k/erE0WATzIdk/s320/Economic+Blueprint.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The Blueprint continues</p>
<blockquote><p>Indeed, the President&#8217;s Budget pays down the debt so aggressively that it runs into an unusual problem—its annual surpluses begin to outstrip the amount of maturing debt starting in 2007. This means that the United States will be effectively unable to retire any more debt than what is assumed in the Administration&#8217;s Budget over the next 10 years—the President achieves &#8220;maximum possible debt retirement&#8221; in his budget.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously that hasn&#8217;t happened.  In fact, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist07z1.xls">debt held by the public as a share of GDP</a> (which are the debt figures the White House likes to use &#8211; and which I also like to use) has increased slightly, from 35.1% in 2000 to a bit over 37% in 2006.  Now, the White House projections are for it to be 35.2% in 2010, 0.1% more than it was 2000 and almost five and a half times greater than GW planned.</p>
<p>Now, this discrepancy between the forecast and reality is sometimes blamed on the stock market bubble&#8230; but that got punctured early in 2000.  Presumably by February of 2001, Bush and Company should have been able to spot something that had happened a year earlier.  Its also sometimes blamed on the recession&#8230; but the recession was actually pretty shallow.  The recovery was slow and inadequate, but the recession itself was not atypical.  Ike had three of them and still cut the debt he inherited from 61.6% of GDP to 45.7%.  Nixon faced two recessions, the collapse of the Gold Standard, and the Oil Embargo, and cut the debt from 33.4% of GDP to 23.9%.  Carter dealt with a recession, oil issues, economic malaise, disco and polyester, and he too reduced the debt from 27.1% to 26.1% of GDP.  The 2001 recession is not an excuse for the discrepancy between the forecast and reality either.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s 9/11 and the assorted wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.  But&#8230; the people who use this excuse are the same ones who tell you the Great Depression only ended because of Pearl Harbor and the American entry into World War 2.  </p>
<p>The real reason for the discrepancy between the forecast and reality is that the administration insisted that cutting taxes was going to make the economy boom, and that would lead to massive increases in tax receipts.  The problem is, that approach had been tried before.  It didn&#8217;t work in the Reagan years, it was actually the opposite of what did work in the Clinton years, and there was no reason to believe it would work this time.  It was predictable&#8230;  but they did it anyway.  </p>
<p>This is not to say you shouldn&#8217;t have cut taxes.  If that was what they wanted to do, that was their right, after all, but making crazy assumptions about what the result of their policies would be when those assumptions contradicted all available facts is inexcusable.  Put another way &#8211; its lying.  And yet, we know where the &#8220;economists&#8221; who peddled and implemented and justified and cheer lead these policies ended up.  A governor&#8217;s mansion (Daniels), a deanship (Hubbard), etc. </p>
<p>Because its not just the press that turns a blind eye.  Its not just the public.  Its those of us who know something about economics, for treating them with respect.  For not calling them what they are.</p>

                                <p>In <a href="http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0208/0208sovwealthfunds.htm">remarks</a> to the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, Professor Morici poses some troublesome issues concerning Sovereign Wealth Funds:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>What Is a Sovereign Wealth Fund?</i> </p>
<p>In purest form, a sovereign wealth fund is a pool of resources, owned and/or controlled by a government, invested in public or private assets, including debt instruments, equities and direct investments in property. </p>
<p>Clearly, the China Investment Corporation (CIC) is an example of such an entity, but so too are national and subnational government interests in European industrial companies. In turn, the investments of CIC in Blackstone and European companies with part government ownership in U.S. companies would be examples of sovereign wealth investments in the United States. </p>
<p>Also, the California Pubic Employees&#8217; Retirement System (Calpers), which invests widely in equities, and similar foreign national and subnational government retirement systems around the world are sovereign investment funds. Those have holdings in U.S. companies. </p>
<p>My point is identifying sovereign wealth is usually easy, but identifying sovereign investments that should concern U.S. policymakers is difficult. Clearly, investments by the national government of China and its state controlled companies raise issues, but generalizing policy from those concerns is a tangle of string&#8230;pull one piece and you get more string than you anticipated. </p>
<p><i>U.S. and Foreign Government Policies</i> </p>
<p>As a common law country and culture, much of U.S. policy must be deduced from piecemeal practice and by generalizing from fragments of legislation and policy directives. For example, the U.S. social security fund is not permitted to make private investments, in part, because Americans don&#8217;t want the U.S. government engaged in allocating capital and influencing business decisions in the U.S. private enterprise system. However, U.S. state governments are permitted to do as they please&#8230;Calpers is a significant example, and it has not always been silent about the management of U.S. companies. The fact is, with its voting powers, it can&#8217;t always be silent. </p>
<p>In contrast, in China and Europe, national and subnational governments make investments expressly for the purposes of promoting industries and affecting competitive international outcomes among businesses. Often, earning a decent return on capital is not a motivation; rather, the objective is creating employment or establishing a national presence in an industry that the market would not otherwise support. </p>
<p>Sometimes the results have strong and lasting effects on the U.S. economy through international commerce and competition. For example, Airbus is a strong competitor today, but McDonnell Douglas no longer exists as an independent entity.<br />Sovereign wealth fund investments could have the capacity to influence important U.S. investment decisions&#8230;the choice of location of major production facilities in the United States or abroad; similarly, the location of R&#038;D facilities; and the structure of investments by U.S. firms that may compete with companies domiciled in the home countries of sovereign wealth funds. </p>
<p>For example, how would a major CIC investment in a major U.S. automaker affect the location of facilities to produce small cars that could be made and exported from China? Or the location of an auto design facility? Chinese inward foreign investment policies have already had such effects. Given the size of Chinese sovereign holdings of U.S. dollars seeking investment opportunities, those issues will quickly move from the hypothetical to tangible. </p>
<p>The influence of sovereign wealth on the U.S. economy through the political process is another issue that will soon emerge. New York banks are busy selling significant minority interests to sovereign wealth funds. The employees of those banks are significant sources of campaign contributions for both political parties, because those banks have large numbers of employees that may contribute the maximum amounts permitted under campaign financing laws. </p>
<p>Through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), the U.S. government has the means to review and screen sovereign investments; however, the recent rush to invest in U.S. banks by sovereign funds and the CFIUS response provides yet further indication that that agency is fairly passive. It seems great public controversy and Congressional out cry are necessary, as was the case in the proposed Dubai Ports investments in the United States, to spring CFIUS into meaningful action. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, with the massive overseas holdings of dollars created by U.S. trade deficits and the intervention in currency markets by foreign central banks, investments by sovereign funds in the U.S. economy will present troubling issues. After all, why would the U.S. government permit a foreign sovereign fund to invest in U.S. companies and wield influence when it does not permit the U.S. social security fund to do the same? </p>
<p>Yet, with all the dollars the United States has chosen to print and leave abroad, it can hardly deny completely sovereign investments in the United States.</p>
<p><i>Shaping U.S. Policy</i></p>
<p>Clearly, some sovereign investments are more troubling or benign than others, and I believe the answers to two sets of questions should help in identifying investments that should be the focus of concern and perhaps screened out. </p>
<p>First, does the sovereign entity share U.S. values about the role of markets and state intervention in managing its national economy and the global economy? </p>
<p>In China for example, sovereign investments have the purpose of creating a socialist market economy, with specific industrialization objectives. Investments by these Chinese entities in U.S. companies pose much greater issues than, for example, investments by Canadian provincial government pension funds. </p>
<p>U.S. experience with large, direct sovereign investments, beyond pension funds, is limited. Investments by sovereign entities whose governments have announced specific goals to cultivate competitors to U.S. enterprises raise much more poignant issues than those whose purposes are to merely earn a profit to finance pensions.<br />Second, does the sovereign entity share U.S. political values or does it see itself in competition with the West? </p>
<p>China remains an autocratic state. The United States offers to the world democracy and markets, while China offers order and prosperity as justification for shunning democracy and controlling markets. </p>
<p>Large investments by such a government in the largest U.S. industrial financial institutions would create important concerns regarding the independent decision making of U.S. banks. The potential to compromise the allocation of large U.S. investments and the enduring independence of U.S. political figures should not be denied. </p>
<p>Investments could be denied in the United States by U.S. corporations or moved abroad to appease foreign minority interests, and U.S. banks could choose to allocate loans away from U.S. companies that compete with foreign companies favored by sovereign investors. </p>
<p>The United States has campaign finance laws, because Americans believe campaign money can influence legislation and public policy; hence, major holdings by sovereign funds in U.S. banks that are now emerging should be a focus of attention. It is hard to imagine that U.S. executives will not be sensitive to the political concerns of large shareholders when they choose candidates to support for public office. </p>
<p><i>An Awkward Corner</i> </p>
<p>The United States is in a box. </p>
<p>By running up large trade deficits and tolerating foreign government intervention in currency markets, the United States has contributed to large dollar overhang abroad&#8230;much of it in the hands of sovereign funds. Investments by those funds in Treasury securities helped keep long-term interest rates artificially low, and helped facilitate the real estate bubble and subprime crisis now besetting U.S. banks. </p>
<p>U.S. banks, owing to questionable lending practices, need massive infusions of capital, which are difficult to find solely from domestic or private sources. We will likely hear from bankers in that foreign sovereign capital will not have any influences different from those of U.S. shareholders. However, we need ask why should foreign sovereign shareholders behave differently in the United States than they do at home? The Chinese government is not a neutral investor in China, and it should not be expect to be a neutral investor here. </p>
<p>Similarly, if the U.S. government wishes not to continue to have growing pressure from sovereign funds to invest in the United States, the U.S. government must finally address the massive U.S. trade deficit and foreign government intervention in currency markets that help finance sovereign investments. After all that is how these sovereign funds are amassing so many dollars to invest in the United States. </p>

<p>Trade and currency manipulation are at the center of our problem. Currency manipulation exacerbates our trade dilemma; it is not the root cause. The last time we had a trade surplus was in &#8217;75 or &#8217;76. In 1994, Clinton signed NAFTA; in 2001, China, again on Clinton&#8217;s watch and with Congress and Clinton&#8217;s strong support, China entered the WTO. The dramatic rise in the trade deficit begins around &#8217;96.</p>
<p>Clinton predicted that China&#8217;s WTO entry would be a win-win proposition, creating thousand of new American jobs and confidently predicting that the already huge deficit with China would fall.</p>
<p>Of course, as I pointed out in an earlier piece, some economists rarely worry about the trade deficit: Mankiw is more concerned with savings; Krugman, with official inflows. Neither is willing to look at trade. Mankiw is the godchild of the right; Krugman, of the left. And, of course, no one talks about NAFTA anymore.</p>
<p>Morici is right: We are now in an awkward corner.</p>

<p>This article has some notions about the Iraq project that is thought provoking. The author must have been talking to buffpilot.</p>
<p>In summary, the author stresses several main ideas.</p>
<p>1. The success of the surge, such as it is, relies totally on Mehdi&#8217;s cease fire in relation to toning down the Badre influence in the growing national government (ends in February unless renewed), and the continued success of the Sunni alliance, one hundred leaders having been assinated to date and increasing.</p>
<p>2. Despite the PR of the administration and candidates, spending has been maintained or increased to build not only a fortress embassy, but what is to be eventually the largest airport in the world with a centralized US command center for the whole of Iraq. Even with a drawdown of troops on the ground, the other part of the plan is domination via air and water. We are there to stay in the country, not just in neighboring countries.</p>
<p>2. There is a concerted effort to keep immunity for all &#8216;foriegn&#8217; employees under contract, totaling maybe over 300,000 personnel, to be free from local controls of any kind. (This is a 1.3% of the population remaining in Iraq, like having 3 million personnel immune to national level prosecution in the US.) Such personnel will operate the facilities and supports and whatever other operations remain.<br />
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me even if the drawdown includes the five brigades, the PR campaign this election is working to keep Iraq on page 5, so the other 180,000 personel are not talked about, nor the continuing building, nor Maliki ignoring the parliament and instituting &#8216;illegal&#8217; agreements. You know, eggs and omellettes.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the next president could change the mission and have Patreaus do other planning as well with a different mission. It would still be a huge behemeth to deal with. To deal with the war machine here would probably be harder.</p>

In my opinion, any cuts in research in this area is cause for alarm. If anything, someone has to take the lead. We are just beginning to be able to measure impacts as sophistication in genetic reseach increases. And current toxic levels and measurements have already been demonstrated to be nonsense for unborns and children.</p>
<blockquote><p>Yesterday, President Bush unveiled his FY 2009 budget proposal. There is plenty to be upset about in the proposal (as OMB Watch&#8217;s Budget Blog has <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/blogs/entry/4548/39">noted here</a>.) Cuts in federal funding of environmental protection programs are among the most troubling.<br />Bush is proposing serious cuts at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency — $330 million, or 4.4 percent. Sen. Barbara Boxer&#8217;s☼<a href="http://sunlightlabs.com/tag/Sen.%20Barbara%20BOXER" rel="tag"></a> Environment and Public Works Committee has prepared a list of EPA programs and research activities that will be cut if Bush gets his way. (See the list <a href="http://epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=Majority.PressReleases&#038;ContentRecord_id=ea044afc-802a-23ad-4948-389d74b36b6b&#038;Designation=Majority">here</a>.)<br />Of note, Bush is proposing cuts to EPA&#8217;s endocrine disruptor research and prevention programs. Boxer&#8217;s committee says the proposal, &#8220;Cuts $3.6 million (35%) from efforts to help protect people from endocrine disruptors, dangerous chemicals that can harm human health at very low levels by interfering with the body&#8217;s hormone systems.&#8221;<br />EPA&#8217;s endocrine disruptor program is already woefully behind schedule. In 1996, Congress passed legislation mandating EPA assess the health impacts of endocrine disruptors. In the summer of 2007, EPA finally got around to step one of the process — releasing a list of chemicals to be tested and laying out the process for assessing risk. <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/article/blogs/entry/3402/23">Critics assailed</a> EPA&#8217;s program as scientifically flawed and accused the agency of designing experiments to purposefully minimize findings of adverse effects. Budget cuts are not likely to move the research along or improve the quality of the risk assessment process.<br />One last thing, from a note at the bottom of the committee&#8217;s press release:<br />These figures are based upon summary tables provided by EPA. Normally, EPA provides a detailed &#8220;Budget Justification&#8221; document with an explanation of all budget figures, but this year has failed to do so, undermining the transparency of the President&#8217;s proposed budget.<br />Not surprisingly, the administration isn&#8217;t just attempting to gut domestic programs, it&#8217;s trying to do it without telling Congress or the public.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Is the McCain camp relying on Communist tactics to get more delegates?  <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/02/11/huckabee-washington-state-vote-like-the-soviet-union">CNN</a> reports that Mike Huckabee seems to think that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mike Huckabee continued to cry foul Monday over the results in Saturday’s Washington State GOP caucuses, saying the state party chairman&#8217;s decision to call the race there early for John McCain is reminiscent of elections in communist bloc nations.  &#8220;That is not what we do in American elections,&#8221; Huckabee said on CNN&#8217;s American Morning Monday. &#8220;Maybe that&#8217;s how they used to conduct it in the old Soviet Union, but you don&#8217;t just throw people&#8217;s votes out and say, &#8216;well, we&#8217;re not going to bother counting them because we kind of think we know where this was going.&#8217;  In a statement released Sunday, Huckabee&#8217;s campaign said Washington&#8217;s GOP Party Chairman Luke Esser called the race for McCain when Huckabee was only losing to the Arizona senator by 242 votes and over 1,500 votes remained to be counted. Esser has said he remains confident he made the right call.  Speaking on CNN, Huckabee said the campaign has sent lawyers to the state to formally challenge the result.  &#8220;I was just stunned,&#8221; Huckabee said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the kind of thing that Republicans across America, not just in Washington State, ought to be outraged over.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Gee – I bet Al Gore knows where Huck is coming from.  We would have had full recount of the Florida vote in 2000 but the Supreme Court decided it wouldn’t be prudent.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTg3Njc5OWFjYzMyNjUyNjBlMWMwNmJiOGIwYTk1YTc=">Kudlow</a> thought he was presenting the case for McCain:</p>
<blockquote><p>McCain will have a unified Republican party &#8211; conservatives and all &#8211; working hard for him. He’s also going to win over the Reagan Democrats, the Bush Democrats, and the Perot independents. These folks demand a strong military, want government off their backs, and are sick and tired of growing federal deficits and out-of-control spending. McCain’s their man.</p></blockquote>
<p>Never mind all hard the first line has Rush Limbaugh laughing.  A strong military will mean defense spending will rise by more than all the earmark reductions that McCain could ever even identify.  Since Kudlow notes McCain will push for even lower tax rates, we’ll see more spending and less revenue.  Only National Review math could make this a platform to reduce those sickening deficits.  </p>
<p>Kudlow later suggested that “McCain is no flip-flopper” noting how McCain opposed ethanol subsidies in Iowa and federal insurance in Florida.  I guess no one told Larry that McCain voted against the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts (but now supports making them permanent). </p>
<p>But then Larry does get something right about McCain’s rhetoric:</p>
<blockquote><p>He remained resolute on winning in Iraq, on the surge, and on the need to prevail abroad if we are to remain safe at home. Democrats were talking defeat.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rather than talking about a sensible approach to the Middle East crisis that horrific decision on March 19, 2003 brought on, McCain (and now Kudlow) want to maintain Bush’s status quo and demonize those of us with any intelligence as defeatist Democrats.  Anyone who would abuse war in this way to win an election</p>

<p>Our chart of the Yahoo stock price for the past couple of years was provided by <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=YHOO&#038;t=2y&#038;l=on&#038;z=m&#038;q=l&#038;c=">Yahoo</a>.  While the stock price on occasion has risen by $30 a share, its value has recently been less than $30 a share.  </p>
<p>While Microsoft offered $44.6 billion for Yahoo or $31 a share, Yahoo’s board declined the offer with <a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/Dispatch/080211markets.aspx">this story</a> noting the following reason:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yahoo&#8217;s board met over the weekend and concluded that the $44.6 billion offer from Microsoft &#8220;substantially undervalues&#8221; the company.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does seem that the Microsoft offer included at least a modest acquisition premium.  Back to <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080211/microsoft_yahoo.html">Yahoo</a> for another take on this story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many analysts expect Microsoft to raise its offer by $5 billion to $12 billion to entice Yahoo to sell. Yahoo is believed to want a bid of at least $56 billion, or about $40 per share. Microsoft&#8217;s first offer, which was made public Feb. 1, was originally valued at $31 per share. Microsoft also could take its bid directly to Yahoo shareholders. The decision could provoke a showdown between two of the world&#8217;s most prominent technology companies with Internet search leader Google Inc. looming in the background. Leery of Microsoft expanding its turf on the Internet, Google already has offered to help Yahoo avert a takeover and urged antitrust regulators to take a hard look at the proposed deal. If the world&#8217;s largest software maker wants Yahoo badly enough, Microsoft could try to override Yahoo&#8217;s board by taking its offer &#8211; originally valued at $31 per share &#8211; directly to the shareholders. Pursuing that risky route probably will require Microsoft to attempt to oust Yahoo&#8217;s current 10-member board. Alternatively, Microsoft could sweeten its bid. Many analysts believe Microsoft is prepared to offer as much as $35 per share for Yahoo, which still boasts one of the Internet&#8217;s largest audiences and most powerful advertising vehicles despite a prolonged slump that has hammered its stock. Yahoo&#8217;s board reached the decision after exploring a wide variety of alternatives during the past week, according to the person who spoke to The Associated Press. The person didn&#8217;t want to be identified because the reasons for Yahoo&#8217;s rebuff won&#8217;t be officially spelled out until Monday morning. Microsoft and Yahoo declined to comment Saturday on the decision, first reported by The Wall Street Journal on its Web site. Yahoo&#8217;s board concluded Microsoft&#8217;s offer is inadequate even though the company couldn&#8217;t find any other potential bidders willing to offer a higher price. Without other suitors on the horizon, Yahoo has had little choice but to turn a cold shoulder toward Microsoft if the board hopes to fulfill its responsibility to fetch the highest price possible for the company, said technology investment banker Ken Marlin.</p></blockquote>
<p>If Yahoo had already shopped its companies to other strategic buyers and the best offer they received was from Microsoft, I’m not quite sure what the board is thinking.  <a href="http://media.wiley.com/product_data/excerpt/19/04714110/0471411019.pdf">Winning through Merger and Acquisition</a> has a nice discussion of how the players in some auction market would view alternative offers.  Yahoo’s reservation price would be its fair market value as a standalone company.  Yahoo likely had several potential buyers who looked also looked at the synergies their companies might enjoy if merged with Yahoo.  Maybe the value of Yahoo to Microsoft might indeed be between $35 and $40 a share but if no other company is willing to bid more than $31 a share, why would Microsoft bid any more for Yahoo?  When Ken Marlin says “Yahoo has had little choice but to turn a cold shoulder toward Microsoft” if there are no other suitors for Yahoo, this makes no sense.  I would not be surprised if the shareholders did make a deal with Microsoft even over the objections of the Yahoo board.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/02/private-equity.html">Barry Ritholtz</a> provides more background on the attempts to purchase Yahoo including:</p>
<blockquote><p>The rumors of this now pre-empted private bid include the following: to be announced as early as February 5th; negotiated price was in the $23-25 range; some Yahoo! properties to be spun out to shareholders.</p></blockquote>
<p>To makes an apples to apples comparison of the $31 a share Microsoft offer and the $25 a share offer from the private equity firm, one would have to know what these properties that would be spun out to the shareholders were worth.  But assuming this value was less than $6 a share, the Microsoft offer still looks tempting to Yahoo shareholders.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers know I&#8217;ve been working on a book looking at how various series from economic growth to crime have changed over the length of each presidential administration since Ike.  Republicans, especially when they notice that a bunch of the series seem to indicate that when economic growth is fastest we tend to have a Democrat in the Oval Office, keep telling me it&#8217;s Congress.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;ve addressed the issue, it doesn&#8217;t seem to go away.  So I was thinking of how I could nail this coffin shut once and for all without resorting to statistics.  And I&#8217;d like to share a graph I put into the book last night&#8230;</p>
<p>But first, let me reprint a graph I&#8217;m kind of fond of&#8230;  the change in the percentage of people&#8217;s income they paid in taxes over the length of each administration:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdaNumL5I/AAAAAAAAA8s/sHO2qVyJLr8/s1600-h/dynamic+scoring+-+taxes+as+a+percent+of+personal+income+graph.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdaNumL5I/AAAAAAAAA8s/sHO2qVyJLr8/s320/dynamic+scoring+-+taxes+as+a+percent+of+personal+income+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Data from here:  <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175814,00.html">IRS</a>)</p>
<p>Republicans insist that cutting taxes leads to higher growth.  The data doesn&#8217;t seem to go out of its way to support that particular story line, but there does seem to be a relationship between taxes and real GDP per capita growth as this other graph I&#8217;ve posted before indicates:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdfdumL6I/AAAAAAAAA80/yYHmZlEFR2A/s1600-h/dynamic+scoring+-+real+GDP+per+capita+graph.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R4bdfdumL6I/AAAAAAAAA80/yYHmZlEFR2A/s320/dynamic+scoring+-+real+GDP+per+capita+graph.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(Data comes from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S7">NIPA table 7.1</a>.)</p>
<p>Anyway, I think the first graph seems to show reasonably clearly that the President has at least some influence on the tax bite.  But what about Congress?   Surely, they must have a humongolous effect too, right?   And obviously, we should expect to see a Republican Congress ripping and shredding into the amount that people pay in taxes, and a Democratic Congress taxing up a storm to steal money from Paris Hilton and give it to some welfare queen, right?</p>
<p>Maybe not:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R7BQcelDTEI/AAAAAAAAA_c/9qLTcTSrFpg/s1600-h/Tax+Bite,+by+Congress.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R7BQcelDTEI/AAAAAAAAA_c/9qLTcTSrFpg/s320/Tax+Bite,+by+Congress.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>There are a lot of things in this graph that cast doubt on the notion that Congress is in the driver&#8217;s seat when it comes to taxes.  Let me just point out the most obvious one &#8211; the tax bite went up quite a bit during the Republican Revolution. </p>
<p>I put the data as well as step by step calculations here:<br /><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILibhkcFuWjpIQ">Tax Bite</a><br /><a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILh3BLB0weFhaA">Real GDP per capita</a></p>
