<p>Ilsm writes another post on whittling the beak:</p>
<p>The next few weeks I am going through <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08621t.pdf">GAO 08-621T</a> and <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08572t.pdf">08-572T</a>.  The T is for testimony..</p>
<p>In the Testimony: a survey of &#8220;52 of DoD&#8217;s Major Weapon Systems&#8221; revealed an &#8220;average of 45% of the staff are individuals outside of DoD&#8221; or contractors.</p>
<p>The briefer said that there needs to be greater attention to areas that should be contracted out.</p>
<p>My experience is that it is far easier to “hire” a contractor and the contractor doesn’t get in the way of delivering shoddy work than getting a civil servant or a soldier.  The testimony affirms the contractors are more expensive as well.</p>
<p>I have a lot of experience in DoD major weapon system acquisition and observed the abuse of support contractors by program offices.  Also, there have been widespread negative impacts on federal employees as the program management offices eliminated civilian employees and hired support contractors who often gave &#8220;better&#8221; estimates and rosier assessments of risks than federal employees who are protected against retaliation and discharge by the Pendleton Act.</p>
<p>They can fire an uncooperative contractor with a few words.</p>
<p>The workload done by support contractors in program offices was not contracted out under a public private competition using <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars/a076/a76_rev2003.pdf">OMB Circular A-76</a>.  A competition using the circular requires identifying and classifying the &#8220;functions&#8221; being performed by government employees commercial activities, the identified activity has to be determined to be not &#8220;inherently governmental&#8221; defined <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/uscode31/usc_sec_31_00000501----000-notes.html">here</a>.  Note that providing advice to government decision makers is not inherently governmental.  Certain activities in a program management office are commercial in nature, however, I disagree that much of the analysis work is of an advisory nature.  Establishing analytical tools, selecting models, determining assumptions, developing conclusions and interpreting risks concerning technology which involve huge future obligations are all significant to the public interest and should be inherently governmental activities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, neither a view of the activity inventory nor use of A-76 competitions contributed this heavy reliance on support contractors in program management offices.   In the testimony the risk of contractors actually controlling governmental functions is identified.  As in many GAO articles recommendations are made with no plan for action. </p>
<p>Later, in the testimony costs for support contractor labor are compared with government labor rates and the contractors are more expensive.  This is contrary to the A-76 competition where the low bidder would win.</p>
<p>Program management offices &#8220;hire&#8221; the support contractors under FAR Part 37 as Advisory and Assistance Services contractors in part to get around A-76 competitions and in part because it is easy.  These contractors are not authorized to perform personal services or act as employees however; if you walk through a program management office you would see no difference between a contractor and a government employee.  Which means the contractors are being used outside the scope of the FAR and are performing voluntary services under the guise of a FAR contract? </p>
<p>The testimony says that most of the cost estimators are support contractors.  These contractors took jobs away from government employees and ruined the career paths for many employees.  And none of the decisions to use contractors are supported by analyses of whether the work is inherently governmental or whether the contractor employees are faster better or cheaper. </p>
<p>And the contractors never tell the program management officer his ideas and estimates are ridiculous.  So much for wondering why systems acquisitions always cost too much take too long and are broken when they finally arrive.  </p>
<p>Using contractor support makes as much sense as whittling beaks with your money.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />by ilsm</p>

<p>Robert Cassidy, former assistant U.S. trade for Asia and for China, and Bill Clinton&#8217;s point man in negotiating China&#8217;s entry into the WTO, now <a href="http://www.fpif.org/fpiftxt/5274">admits</a> the agreement was flawed from the start, benefiting two groups: multinationals that moved to China and financial firms that financed those investments.</p>
<blockquote><p>The beneficiaries of the agreement with China fall into two groups: multinational companies that moved to China and the financial institutions that financed those investments, trade flows, and deficits.<br />&#8230;<br />Sourcing from China, whether from direct investment or through licensing arrangements, has allowed companies to cut costs and increase profits, as reflected in increased corporate profits and the surge in the U.S. stock market.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly what this writer has been saying ad nauseum.</p>
<p>Look down our blog role. What blogs have addressed these issues? Which have followed the party line?</p>
<p>Many economists focused merely on the danger of official inflows: Central bank purchases of Treasury notes, making us the premier debtor nation.</p>
<p>What they have failed to see it was the vast flow of cash to our financial institutions, a flow that was in part responsible for the housing bubble. There is a direct link between globalization and our housing bubble.</p>
<p>Financial institutions now had plenty of cash to lend. That cash was the seed money for the housing bubble. Americans have been trained to believe unthinkingly in credit.  Needed were the right conditions: low interest rates to entice the foolish and no regulations to protect them.</p>
<p>The Fed supplied the first. Innovative and unregulated financing provided the second. Credit card companies, already seeing how the game was to be played, with the help of Congress, tightened the noose on consumers.</p>
<p>On the stock market front, sourcing to China created a booming market for companies and investors. Those at the top of the pecking order became unimaginably rich. Of course, working wages stagnated. Economists told us that we had to become more competitive, more educated.</p>
<p>The fleecing of America continued.</p>
<p>Outsourcing. Outsourcing. Labor, tax, and environmental arbitrage. This problem is not merely a Republican or neo-conservative creation. Democrats, Bill Clinton and company, have been party to it as well. And they have studiously avoided the real issue.</p>
<p>China played the game well. It had a plan; we had merely greed.</p>
<p>China has used its vast and poor population as an export machine, all to accomplish its next great leap forward.</p>
<p>Currency manipulation has been, of course, central.</p>
<blockquote><p>Using China as an example once again, proponents of the free trade model argue that China has a competitive advantage in wage rates that makes it ideal as the global manufacturing center that it has become. A closer examination, however, reveals that China has adopted an export-led development strategy, the centerpiece of which is a currency that is undervalued by 20-80%, with the consensus leaning toward 40%. Thus China’s wages, in U.S. dollar terms, are 40% cheaper than they would have been if the currency were allowed to freely float. Similarly, foreign investors receive a 40% subsidy to develop operations in China. To add insult to injury, our exports are taxed at an additional effective 40% rate. </p></blockquote>
<p>Initially, foreign firms enjoyed either a 15% corporate tax rate or a ten-year tax holiday, while indigenous Chinese firms paid a 30% rate. Doesn&#8217;t this fact tell us something about who profited from China&#8217;s exports? That loophole is slowing being closed. But the horse is out of the barn. China focused rapidly growing its infrastructure. Foreign firms in China accounted for over 60% of its exports; in IT, the percentage is closer to 80%. China has no immediate interest in becoming a consuming nation.</p>
<p>Globalization has been designed to benefit those at the top. Congress, the WTO, the World Bank, and hordes of economists have all been complicit. Those who have not addressed the problem directly are equally complicit.</p>
<p>Labor and tax arbitrage have been amply outlined above. How has environmental arbitrage worked? Many multinationals claim they are not <i>directly</i> responsible for China massive pollution problems. Perhaps not, but they have benefited from it. All that rapidly built infrastructure enabled their export machine&#8230;as did the required massive increase in energy. The result has been monstrous pollution.</p>
<p>Welcome to how globalization was designed.</p>

<p>What a difference a quarter makes, as the International Air Transport Association&#8217;s forecast of aggregate airline industry has taken a $6.8 billion or $10.6 billion swing to the red, depending on how optimistic you are (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/business/worldbusiness/03air.html">per the NYT</a>):<br />
<blockquote>In March, the group forecast a profit of $4.5 billion&#8230;</p>
<p>If the price of oil, now just below $130 a barrel, averages $107 over 2008, the industry will lose $2.3 billion for the year, the chief executive of the group, Giovanni Bisignani, said. Should it trade at $135 a barrel for the rest of the year, the industry will lose $6.1 billion, he added.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mirroring the global industry&#8217;s situation, the U.S. Air Transport Association has evolved in the last month from <a href="http://www.smartskies.org/GetOnBoard/Sky+High+Fuel+Prices+Impact+Air+Travel+5_1_08.htm">campaigning for a halt</a> to additions to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to calling for a release of <a href="https://ssl.capwiz.com/airlines/home/">100 million barrels of oil from the SPR</a> to learn those commodities speculators and try to get a break on fuel prices that are killing them.  In doing so, they&#8217;re joining the trucking industry — whose marginal firms have also been dropping like flies — in a desperate scramble for oil price relief by any means necessary.  (As a would-be member of the Pigou Club, this is where I&#8217;m actually a little happy that past bad policy does constrain present stupid policy actions).  Via <a href="http://www.trafficworld.com/newssection/government.asp?id=46509">TrafficWorld</a> (subscription maybe required):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The airline industry as it is constituted today was not built to withstand oil prices at $125 a barrel, and certainly not when fuel expenses are coupled with a weak U.S. economy,&#8221; American Airlines Chairman and CEO Gerard Arpey said in a statement.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, they shouldn&#8217;t hold their breath:<br />
<blockquote>It seems unlikely the Energy Department will act on the SPR on its own.
<p>Energy Department Secretary Samuel Bodman told a House panel last week tapping into the SPR would be a bad idea,  </p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s meant to be used in times of severe supply disruption,&#8221; said DOE spokeswoman Angela Hill. &#8220;We just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to pull from this national asset, this security mechanism that protects the American people.&#8221;</p>

<p>This brings us to a dilemma of our partly privatized transportation system.  Assuming the airline industry&#8217;s fiery crash can be avoided, deregulated airlines at least could have been regarded as relatively effective at taking money from shareholders&#8217; pockets and corporate travel budgets and turning it into relatively cheap and fast intercity transportation for the middle class.</p>
<p>But continuing a theme of the last few transportation-related posts, it&#8217;s yet another example of the U.S.&#8217;s glass-jawed infrastructure: plan A assumes cheap oil forever, and there is no plan B.  Or, to be a bit more precise, plan B requires large investments with long lead-time, and plan A can become non-operational fast enough that people ex post want plan B yesterday.  Long-distance passenger travel may be some notches short of food or power distribution among essential services, but internal mobility is still important.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/05/25/ben-stein-watch-may-25-2008?rss=true">Ben Stein is not alone</a> in mistaking plan A-prime for a plan B &#8216;moon shot.&#8217;
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;We should drill for oil and natural gas anywhere we got oil and natural gas &#8211; except maybe cemeteries,&#8221; said Rep. Ted Poe, R-Texas. &#8220;And we can slant drill into cemeteries.&#8221; </p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>&#8220;Doing anything,&#8221; said the ATA&#8217;s May, &#8220;is better then what they are doing now &#8211; which is nothing.&#8221;</p>

<p>With leadership like that&#8230;</p>

                                <p>by Noni Mausa</p>
<p>I was listening to an interesting debate tonight before an audience of Canadians on the CBC radio show  &#8220;Ideas&#8221; which discussed which president, R or D, would give rise to a safer world.  Link here:  (http://www.munkdebates.com/)</p>
<p>The first speaker, Charles Krauthammer, lost me in the first minute or two with this stunning argument, dropped as a mere passing horse-apple in his gallop to proclaim that Republican candidate McCain&#8217;s experience trumped all.  No one called him on it, he went on to other absurdities too quickly, but keep an eye out for this argument in public discourse.  I am sure it will bob to the surface again.  Here it is:</p>
<p>Krauthammer contended that  McCain isn&#8217;t really old, because &#8220;based on median age, <i>nine presidents this century have been older&#8221;.</i></p>
<p>Oh, slap me with a haddock!  Is he really trying to grade age on a curve, saying that as the population gets older, we should redefine what &#8220;old&#8221; really is?</p>
<p>If so, then it makes just as much sense to raise the required minimum age for presidential candidates, too.  35 is no longer &#8220;old enough&#8221;, let&#8217;s try 45.  Same for the drinking age and driver&#8217;s licensing, lets push them up to age 30.  THAT should be popular.</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, today&#8217;s 70 year olds are healthier and more functional than a generation ago (at least the ones who can afford health care.).  But they are still <i>old</i>, just as high school kids are still young, and women in their 50s are menopausal, and men in their 50s buy red sports cars.</p>
<p>Why would Krauthammer make this peculiar argument?  My guess is, it lays the conceptual groundwork for trying to flatter and cajole and suck up to older Americans, many of whom have given up on Republicans and can no longer be swayed by Republican attempts to plant their trademark on conservative economic and family values.</p>
<p>At the same time I imagine they are setting up a scenario where anyone questioning McCain&#8217;s age, could be labeled as dismissive of aged people.  Obama, conversely, can be painted as a gangly kid, despite being John Kennedy&#8217;s age.  I&#8217;m sorry, nobody who is 47 is a kid anymore.  Or at least, only by comparison with a man 25 years older.</p>

                                <p>BNA Daily Tax RealTime Update ran the following story this afternoon:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senate Passes 2009 Budget Plan GOP Assails as Massive Tax Increase</p>
<p>The Senate, on a narrow, mostly party-line vote, adopted a 2009 budget plan that Democrats said leaves open the possibility of extending some of President Bush&#8217;s 2001 and 2003 temporary tax cuts, but that Republicans said will lead to a large tax increase. The conference report for the 2009 budget resolution (S. Con. Res. 70) was adopted 48-45, with two Republicans, Sen. Susan Collins (R-Me.) and Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Me.) joining Democrats and one Independent in favor of the largely non-binding plan. One Democrat, Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), joined Republicans in opposing the plan. The House is expected to vote on the report June 5.</p></blockquote>
<p>There will be no tax increase – just the sun-setting of the 2001 and 2003 tax shifts.  Now George W. Bush likes to claim he cut taxes but he didn’t.  His Administration saw government spending go up and there are no serious proposals from his party to significantly cut government spending over the future.  Anyone who understands the long-run government budget constraint recognizes that the reversal of these temporary tax “cuts” is inevitable.  Therefore, this is not a tax increase.  And in the interest of being bipartisan – let me suggest that Senate Democrat Evan Bayh should be ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>After reading <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/hoisted-from-comments-annals-of.html">Tom Bozzo&#8217;s </a>post via Vtcodger, I was inspired by the comments about bad management. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m not confident that the issue of the Big 3 management is the result of stupidity as much as it is from philosophy.  Part of the bitching of the Big 3 in the first crisis was do to the need to move from focusing on money to focusing on a solution to a need: personal transportation.  We got the Vega with unlined aluminum blocks and mickey mouse brakes.  Infact, if you ever saw the casting of the engine, it looked like it was 1/2 a casting of the small block V8. </p>
<p>However, Japan&#8217;s business approach appears to be an extension of their life philosophy.  Thus, Toyota brought out the Prius in Japan in 1997.  4 years after the creation by President Clinton of The Partnership for the Next Generation of Vehicles.  This was 1 year after <a href="http://www.toyoland.com/prius/chronology.html">Toyota announces</a>: January 16, 1992 &#8211; Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) announces the Earth Charter, a document outlining goals to develop and market vehicles with the lowest emissions possible. </p>
<p>They set out to solve a need. We instead got a endless talking point that the purpose of a company is to make a profit.  Well, the Big 3 made their profit.  Now what?</p>
<p>And that <a href="http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/energy/eng-9.cfm">PNGV program</a>?  “The 1994 PNGV Program Plan calls for a &#8220;concept vehicle&#8221; to be ready in about six years, and a &#8220;production prototype&#8221; to be ready in about ten years.”</p>
<p>Just a little late in their time planning, wouldn&#8217;t you say?  Toyota was out 3 years post this report in their country and world production 2 years before the PNGV program called for a &#8220;prototype&#8221;!  And Toyota didn&#8217;t need to be sweet talked into it.  But we did spend some money:<br />
<blockquote>“In FY1995, about $308 million was appropriated for ongoing PNGV-related R&#038;D at eight federal agencies. Of this total, 88S went to three agencies: DOE, Department of Commerce (DOC), and National Science Foundation (NSF). Industry is spending about $100 million during this early, high-risk part of the program. For FY1996, the Administration requested $383 million. The House approved $228 million, a cut of $80 million or 26% from the FY1995 level, including zero funding for two agencies. However, the Conference mark is $312 million, which is nearly even with the FY1995 level, but is $71 million or 19%. lower than the Administration request.”</p></blockquote>
<p>But, <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/11/05/071105crbo_books_kolbert">let&#8217;s speed forward</a>.<br />
<blockquote>By 1997, participants had settled on the specs of the “super car,” as it became known: the sedan would be a lightweight, diesel-electric hybrid. (Diesel engines, because they use a higher compression ratio, consume less fuel per mile than gasoline engines do.) By 2000, the Big Three had all produced concept cars, which were unveiled with much fanfare at the North American Auto Show, in Detroit. G.M.’s car, which was called the Precept, came equipped with two electric motors, one mounted on each axle. Ford’s Prodigy featured an aluminum body and rear-facing cameras in place of side-view mirrors, and the Dodge ESX3 was made in large part out of plastic. <br />The concept cars were wheeled out, then wheeled away, never to be seen again.</p></blockquote>
<p>You do know the story of the EV-1?</p>
<blockquote><p>In January, 2002, just months before the prototypes of the vehicles were supposed to be delivered and after more than a billion dollars of federal money had been spent, Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced that the Bush Administration was scrapping the project. When he delivered the announcement, Abraham was flanked by top executives from the Big Three, at least one of whom—G.M.’s chairman, Jack Smith—had stood next to President Clinton when he launched the program, eight years earlier. Abraham explained—and the auto executives seemed to agree—that the program had been based on a fundamentally flawed premise. The future of the car didn’t lie with diesel hybrids or any other technology that would allow vehicles to get eighty miles to the gallon. “We can do better than that,” Abraham declared. The Administration and the automakers, he said, were undertaking a new, even more ambitious venture, called FreedomCAR. The goal of this project was to produce vehicles that would run on pure hydrogen. </p></blockquote>
<p>And thus was born the fable of hydrogen.  Great!  But what about the issue coming up like right about now?  Toyota saw it.  They solved it and I bet they already have something more in the works for the “more ambitious venture”.  You know what else Toyota was <a href="http://john1701a.com/prius/prius-history.htm">doing in 2002</a>?<br />
<blockquote>Toyota announced they were now making a profit from the sale of each Prius.  The success of hybrids had now become apparent.</p></blockquote>
<p>How&#8217;s that stated purpose of a company working out for ya now?  What&#8217;s the solution now?  Another new purpose for a company?  How about: It&#8217;s no longer to make money, it&#8217;s to not have it taxed away.  That&#8217;s how the stock holders will get paid.</p>

<p><a href="http://robertdfeinman.com/society/non_adiabatic_economics.html">Non-Adiabatic Economics</a> by robertdfeinman, continuing the discussion of economics as a science from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/economics-as-science-no-chance.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/week-end-open-thread.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Most economic theories assume that the system under consideration is stable or is, at least, tending toward a stable state. I&#8217;m going to make an analogy with thermodynamics. <br />The situation I have in mind is one of an ideal gas enclosed in a vessel. The law that we are concerned with is the gas law which states that pressure time volume equals a constant for a given temperature, i.e PV = C. In the ideal situation (say a gas under pressure from a piston) as we push down on the piston the volume will decrease and the pressure will increase. In the ideal situation this is called an adiabatic process. In the real world, however there is a chance that the temperature will change as the vessel conducts heat from the gas to the surroundings through the walls of the container. This is a non-adiabatic process.</p>
<p>I consider classical economics as equivalent to the simplifying assumptions of the adiabatic gas law. Take a simple example: demand vs price. The classic description is that as demand increases the price will rise which will cause a slackening in demand until a new equilibrium is reached. But in the real world when demand increases, sometimes production increases and the price doesn&#8217;t increase. This is the non-adiabatic case.</p>
<p>Another common example has to do with competition. The basic understanding is that in a competitive marketplace the price of the item will fall until the marginal cost of producing the next copy of the item will equal the price. In other words none of the firms will be making a profit. It&#8217;s true that there are sometimes limited price wars of this nature, but in many cases the behavior is not as predicted by theory. Sometimes firms sell at below cost to drive weaker firms out of the market, sometimes they under produce to prevent the cost from dropping too low, sometimes they attempt to create product differentiation perception through advertising so that demand is not uniform. Most common these days is for firms to tacitly agree to divide a market between them using various signaling mechanisms (since outright collusion is supposed to be illegal). A common example is when an airline declares a fare increase in advance of the effective date so that their competitors are alerted. If the competitors refuse to raise the price then the original airline will revoke the increase.</p>
<p>This one written by robertdfeinman.<br />More below the fold.</p>
<p>Still another example of non-adiabatic economics has to do with under investment by a firm. Classical theory says a firm should plan to expand its manufacturing capacity when it sees a growing market, but this doesn&#8217;t always happen. The US steel industry under invested for decades and reaped high profits during the period. When newer firms entered the market they could no longer compete, their infrastructure was obsolete and the profits had all been extracted from the firms by the owners and managers. The firms collapsed. Why did these firms not behave in the way classical theory would expect? The explanation is that the objectives of those running the firms differed from those expected. They were not interested in the long-term health of the firm, they just wanted to make their bundle and get out. This was a non-adiabatic condition. Classical theory assumes that the managers of the firm are interested in its long-term prospects. This turns out not to be true in many cases.</p>
<p>The situation has become more glaring over the past half century or so as the separation between the owners of firms and the managers has widened. Managers have only a nominal investment in a firm and know that they will have a relatively short tenure. Traditional owners (say the Ford family for Ford Motors) are becoming increasingly rare. Most &#8220;owners&#8221; are now stockholders who tend not to have any relationship with the firm, but regard the stock itself as the investment. Performance of the firm is only of concern in as much as it influences the price of the shares over the period that the investor is involved. The only stakeholders who may be interested in the sustained health of a company are the employees, and they have no control in most cases. The classical model no longer applies.</p>
<p>Returning to the idea that markets tend to stability, we see this violated all the time. Selling at a loss is an attempt to permanently change a market by driving out competitors. Only in shared monopolies do firms try to preserve stability, otherwise they are always trying to effect permanent changes in the market. A firm may deliberately over invest in production in order to cash in on a fad, knowing that the demand can&#8217;t be sustained over the long term. This is especially true with consumer electronics, one year it is CB radios, then it is cell phones, the year after GPS units or electronic picture frames. If the owners of these firms are not complete novices they must know that the game is to make as much profit as quickly as possible, pick up your marbles and leave the game. The excess investment in equipment and staff is somebody else&#8217;s problem.</p>
<p>Of course economic theory has explanations for all these types of disturbances, but they regard them as exceptions rather than as a series of non-adiabatic events that never correspond to the ideal case.</p>
<p>The gas law is physics, it deals in the ideal case. The action in an automotive cylinder is engineering, it must always deal with non-adiabatic conditions. Economics needs to move away from the physics model and towards the engineering framework. It&#8217;s messy, much harder to calculate, but if you want your gadget to work in the real world you had better understand where the ideal is inadequate.</p>
<p>Moral: Ideal theories make for poor policy prescriptions.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was in line at the grocery store behind a woman buying a weeks supply for her family.<br />Nothing unusual about that, but she had brought her own bags so she would not be using plastic and/or paper sacks that would be thrown away after one use. She had about a half dozen bags.</p>
<p>What happened was the cash register operator spent half her time placing the many items in the different bags according to a logical pattern that spread the weight around, put bottle in different bags, fresh fruit and vegetables together and boxed items on the bottom.  All the things I learned to do years ago when I worked as a bagger as a teenager.</p>
<p>All this turned out to be a very time consuming exercise that on balance meant that the productivity of the grocery store clerk plunged.</p>
<p>In light of this mornings report of very good productivity growth, will poor grocery store clerk productivity be an unintended consequence of conservation measures?  Is this one example of how conservation will generate unintended trade-offs?  The productivity slowdown from 1975 to 1995 has never been adequately understood and I&#8217;ve always believed that shifting investment from minimizing labor to minimizing oil use was a major factor behind the slowdown.  Was my experience yesterday just a leading indicator of what to expect and is the recent strength in productivity the tail end of a trend that high priced energy will bring to an end?</p>

                                <p>Here&#8217;s Vtcodger:<br />
<blockquote>Detroit&#8217;s problems are self inflicted and entirely predictable &#8230; although not by the guys they are paying millions of dollars a year to do the predicting.</p>
<p>Whocudanode? Anyone with half a brain.</p>
<p>The basic problem is that between 1950 when they probably did build the best cars in the world (with the possible exception of VW&#8217;s beetle) and 1975, they did nothing much to improve the reliability, safety, or handling of their cars. They just raked in the cash and headed to the country club for a round of golf and a few drinks.</p>
<p>Then they woke up one morning and there was a gas shortage. Worse, the Japanese were selling cars that cost less, lasted longer, didn&#8217;t break as often, got better gas mileage and &#8212; important to those of us who do not live in Detroit &#8212; could negotiate curves and hills in relative safety.</p>
<p>Detroit&#8217;s response was to limit Japanese car imports, lie a lot, and eventually to spend a gazillion dollars in advertising convincing Americans that they wanted and needed huge, expensive, and not especially useful vehicles. In fact Americans (mostly) didn&#8217;t need those vehicles. At least not as far as I can see. But Detroit needed to sell them.</p>
<p>So now, here we are again. Another gas crisis, and Detroit still can&#8217;t build inexpensive, reliable, fuel efficient cars profitably. If you ask me, that is no one&#8217;s fault but Detroit&#8217;s.</p>
<p>The problem. Bad management. Lots and lots of bad management. Solution: GM should I think, consider simply folding up its tent and liquidating the company. I don&#8217;t think Chrysler matters. Ford &#8212; Might be salvageable. But it&#8217;s going to take years, and they are going to be rough years.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think Ford and GM are more similarly situated, and contrast with Daimler-less Chrysler, at least in that both manage to sell fuel-efficient cars in large quantities and sometimes even at a profit into the European market.  Both also seem to have been hit with large clue-sticks, as other recent car news has indicated some willingness to actually try to sell decent <a href="http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080602/FREE/516060181/1530/FREE">compacts</a> and <a href="http://www.autoweek.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080530/FREE/356550315/1023/CARNEWS">subcompacts</a> in the U.S. on the part of both firms.  Arguably they&#8217;ve stopped digging their graves, but &#8216;Codger is right that getting out is another matter.</p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.truthout.org/article/is-water-becoming-new-oil">The world&#8217;s remaining accessible fresh-water supplies</a> are divided among industry (20 percent), agriculture (70 percent), and domestic use (10 percent), according to the United Nations. </p>
<p>    Meanwhile, fresh-water consumption worldwide has more than doubled since World War II to nearly 4,000 cubic kilometers annually and set to rise another 25 percent by 2030, says a 2007 report by the Zurich-based Sustainable Asset Management (SAM) group investment firm. </p>
<p><em>Up to triple that is available for human use, so there should be plenty, the report says. But waste, climate change, and pollution have left clean water supplies running short. </em><br />    &#8220;We have ignored demand for decades, just assuming supplies of water would be there,&#8221; Dr. Gleick says. &#8220;Now we have to learn to manage water demand and &#8211; on top of that &#8211; deal with climate change, too.&#8221; </p>
<p>    Population and economic growth across Asia and the rest of the developing world is a major factor driving fresh-water scarcity. The earth&#8217;s human population is predicted to rise from 6 billion to about 9 billion by 2050, the UN reports. Feeding them will mean more irrigation for crops. </p>
<p>    Increasing attention is also being paid to the global &#8220;virtual water&#8221; trade. It appears in food or other products that require water to produce, products that are then exported to another nation. The US may consume even more water &#8211; virtual water &#8211; by importing goods that require lots of water to make. At the same time, the US exports virtual water through goods it sells abroad.</p></blockquote>
