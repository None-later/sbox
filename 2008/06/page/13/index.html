<p>Math and Math</p>
<p>I was looking at a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Standard-Poors-Guide-New-Investor/dp/0071410309">&#8220;The Standard and Poor&#8217;s guide for the  <br />New Investor,&#8221; by Nilus Mattive.</a></p>
<p>In it I found offered the following counterintuitive argument (page 9):</p>
<p>Suppose you inherit 40,000 dollars and you want to buy a 40,000  <br />dollar car.  You can get the car for no money down at 5% over 48  <br />months., while putting the 40,000 into a bank account at 4%.  Or you  <br />can pay cash.  Which should you do?</p>
<p>The author says put the money in the bank and pay for the car on time.</p>
<p>Then he shows how the 921 dollar monthly payments add up to only  <br />$4,216 in interest over 48 months, while the bank pays $6,794 on the  <br />40,000 over that time. ($6,920 if compounded monthly.)</p>
<p>He explains this unexpected result is because the principal on the  <br />car is being paid down all the time, so the interest payments are  <br />smaller than you expected.  And then he says this is why you need to  <br />do the math.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to leave this as a problem for the readers of Angry Bear&#8230; </p>
<p>is Mattive right?</p>
<p>Answer below the fold.</p>
<p>The answer is no.</p>
<p>What he left out is that if you paid cash,  you&#8217;d have those 921  <br />dollar monthly payments to do with whatever you wanted.  And if you  <br />wanted to put them in the bank at that 4% interest, you&#8217;d have $47974  <br />in the bank at the end of 48 months instead of the $46920 you&#8217;d have  <br />had by leaving the $40000 in the bank and making the car payments.</p>
<p>This is a fairly simple case of an expert dazzling himself with his  <br />own cleverness.  And the moral of the story is that it happens all  <br />the time.  Correct math, even clever math, is no guarantee that you  <br />are making any sense. And that&#8217;s just the easy bits.  He doesn&#8217;t  <br />consider what you could be doing with that 40,000 instead of leaving  <br />it in the bank, or with your time if you didn&#8217;t have to meet those  <br />car payments every month.</p>

It is partisan and so below the fold.</p>
<blockquote><p>Total Intelligence, which opened for business in February 2007, is a fusion of three entities bought up by Prince: the Terrorism Research Center, Technical Defense and The Black Group&#8211;Blackwater vice chair Cofer Black&#8217;s consulting agency. The company&#8217;s leadership reads like a Who&#8217;s Who of the CIA&#8217;s &#8220;war on terror&#8221; operations after 9/11. In addition to the twenty-eight-year CIA veteran Black, who is chair of Total Intelligence, the company&#8217;s executives include CEO Robert Richer, the former associate deputy director of the agency&#8217;s Directorate of Operations and the second-ranking official in charge of clandestine operations. From 1999 to 2004, Richer was head of the CIA&#8217;s Near East and South Asia Division, where he ran clandestine operations throughout the Middle East and South Asia. As part of his duties, he was the CIA liaison with Jordan&#8217;s King Abdullah, a key US ally and Blackwater client, and briefed George W. Bush on the burgeoning Iraqi resistance in its early stages. </p>
<p>Total Intelligence&#8217;s chief operating officer is Enrique &#8220;Ric&#8221; Prado, a twenty-four-year CIA veteran and former senior executive officer in the Directorate of Operations. He spent more than a decade working in the CIA&#8217;s Counterterrorist Center and ten years with the CIA&#8217;s &#8220;paramilitary&#8221; Special Operations Group. Prado and Black worked closely at the CIA. Prado also served in Latin America with Jose Rodriguez, who gained infamy late last year after it was revealed that as director of the National Clandestine Service at the CIA he was allegedly responsible for destroying videotapes of interrogations of prisoners, during which &#8220;enhanced interrogation techniques,&#8221; including waterboarding, were reportedly used. Richer told the New York Times he recalled many conversations with Rodriguez, about the tapes. &#8220;He would always say, &#8216;I&#8217;m not going to let my people get nailed for something they were ordered to do,'&#8221; Richer said of his former boss. Before the scandal, there were reports that Blackwater had been &#8220;aggressively recruiting&#8221; Rodriguez. He has since retired from the CIA. </p>
<p>The leadership of Total Intelligence also includes Craig Johnson, a twenty-seven-year CIA officer who specialized in Central and South America, and Caleb &#8220;Cal&#8221; Temple, who joined the company straight out of the Defense Intelligence Agency, where he served from 2004 to &#8217;06 as chief of the Office of Intelligence Operations in the Joint Intelligence Task Force&#8211;Combating Terrorism. According to his Total Intelligence bio, Temple directed the &#8220;DIA&#8217;s 24/7 analytic terrorism target development and other counterterrorism intelligence activities in support of military operations worldwide. He also oversaw 24/7 global counterterrorism indications and warning analysis for the U.S. Defense Department.&#8221; The company also boasts officials drawn from the Drug Enforcement Agency and the FBI. </p>
<p>Total Intelligence is run out of an office on the ninth floor of a building in the Ballston area of Arlington, Virginia. Its &#8220;Global Fusion Center,&#8221; complete with large-screen TVs broadcasting international news channels and computer stations staffed by analysts surfing the web, &#8220;operates around the clock every day of the year&#8221; and is modeled after the CIA&#8217;s counterterrorist center, once run by Black. The firm employs at least sixty-five full-time staff&#8211;some estimates say it&#8217;s closer to 100. &#8220;Total Intel brings the&#8230;skills traditionally honed by CIA operatives directly to the board room,&#8221; Black said when the company launched. &#8220;With a service like this, CEOs and their security personnel will be able to respond to threats quickly and confidently&#8211;whether it&#8217;s determining which city is safest to open a new plant in or working to keep employees out of harm&#8217;s way after a terrorist attack.&#8221; </p>
<p>Black insists, &#8220;This is a completely legal enterprise. We break no laws. We don&#8217;t go anywhere near breaking laws. We don&#8217;t have to.&#8221; But what services Total Intelligence is providing, and to whom, is shrouded in secrecy. It is clear, though, that the company is leveraging the reputations and inside connections of its executives. &#8220;Cofer can open doors,&#8221; Richer told the Washington Post in 2007. &#8220;I can open doors. We can generally get in to see who we need to see. We don&#8217;t help pay bribes. We do everything within the law, but we can deal with the right minister or person.&#8221; Black told the paper he and Richer spend a lot of their time traveling. &#8220;I am discreet in where I go and who I see. I spend most of my time dealing with senior people in governments, making connections.&#8221; But it is clear that the existing connections from the former spooks&#8217; time at the agency have brought business to Total Intelligence. </p>
<p>Take the case of Jordan. For years, Richer worked closely with King Abdullah, as his CIA liaison. As journalist Ken Silverstein reported, &#8220;The CIA has lavishly subsidized Jordan&#8217;s intelligence service, and has sent millions of dollars in recent years for intelligence training. After Richer retired, sources say, he helped Blackwater land a lucrative deal with the Jordanian government to provide the same sort of training offered by the CIA. Millions of dollars that the CIA &#8216;invested&#8217; in Jordan walked out the door with Richer&#8211;if this were a movie, it would be a cross between Jerry Maguire and Syriana. &#8216;People [at the agency] are pissed off,&#8217; said one source. &#8216;Abdullah still speaks with Richer regularly, and he thinks that&#8217;s the same thing as talking to us. He thinks Richer is still the man.&#8217; Except in this case it&#8217;s Richer, not his client, yelling &#8216;show me the money.'&#8221; </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The Republican candidate for president embraced low-tax-rate incentives to grow the economy, promising a combination of pro-growth tax reform and simplification along with significant spending restraint. He has called himself a foot soldier in the Reagan revolution … McCain pledged to keep taxes low for families and employers, putting himself squarely in Ronald Reagan’s camp and offering to extend the long prosperity wave started by the Gipper over twenty-five years ago. In contrast, McCain charged Obama — who gave his economic speech on Monday — with proposing the single-biggest tax hike in the entire post-WWII period. McCain asserted that “no matter which of us wins in November, there will be change in Washington. The question is what kind of change?” Obama says a McCain victory will hand Bush a third term. McCain says an Obama victory gives Jimmy Carter a second term.  I think McCain gets it right. Getting down to specifics, McCain said he will maintain the low income and investment tax rates put in place by President Bush. He singled out the need to keep the capital-gains tax rate at a low 15 percent, so that businesses will have the investment necessary to expand jobs, productivity, and real wages. Completely unlike Obama, McCain is saying you can’t have capitalism without capital. And he recognizes that investors must have high after-tax returns in order to take risks and fuel entrepreneurial activity.  On this point, think high-risk energy technologies for clean coal, natural gas, oil shale, and nuclear and cellulosic power. McCain repeated his plan to reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 percent from 35 percent. This could be his single-most-important tax reform. Not only will it enhance America’s global competitiveness, since we have the second highest corporate tax among large countries. But a number of studies show that roughly 70 percent of the benefits from a lower corporate tax will flow to the workforce in the form of higher real wages and more jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>How many times do we have to remind these National Review nitwits about the economic record of the 1980’s?  Reagan did not cut taxes – he deferred them.  I say this because we did not have reductions in government spending “Reagan style” as Kudlow once declared.  We did have deficits – which some rightwingers falsely attribute to some alleged explosion in government spending.  The truth is that Federal spending as a share of GDP neither rose nor fell.  But people did consume more, which means national savings fell and real interest rates rose which led to less investment and slower long-term growth.  Incidentally, this is all well explained in the first textbook that Greg Mankiw published.  But I guess Kudlow never read this book or anything else on macroeconomics outside Kudlow’s own babbling.</p>
<p>George W. Bush also pretended to cut taxes but we all know government spending has increased as a share of GDP.  So we did not have tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 – only tax deferrals.  And yes – national savings and investment are lower than they were in those allegedly high tax Clinton years.  I guess Kudlow is not aware that real GDP grew by 3.7% per year under Clinton while it grew by only 3.0% during the Reagan-Bush41 years.  But even 3% would seem high compared to the anemic growth of GDP under George W. Bush.  And Kudlow is stupid enough to think that a continuation of Bush43’s fiscal irresponsibility is the path to more investment and growth?  No wonder he writes for the National Review!</p>

                                <p>Not very much says <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/10/AR2008061002531.html">Ruth Marcus</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Confronting the debt amassed during the Revolutionary War, George Washington was determined to pay it off, warning against &#8220;ungenerously throwing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear.&#8221; Confronting the enormous costs about to be piled up in Iraq, George Bush determined to press for new tax cuts &#8212; not just &#8220;little bitty tax relief,&#8221; as he put it, but hundreds of billions more. &#8220;This contrast &#8212; between an active war effort on one hand and substantial tax cuts on the other &#8212; has no precedent in American history,&#8221; three tax historians explain in &#8220;War and Taxes,&#8221; a new book from the Urban Institute. Rather, since the War of 1812, &#8220;special taxes have supported every major military conflict in our nation&#8217;s history.&#8221; As Steven Bank, Kirk Stark and Joseph Thorndike show, presidents and lawmakers have not always been eager to impose taxes to pay war costs. But historically, Republicans and Democrats alike ultimately acknowledged the necessity &#8212; fiscal and moral &#8212; of shared sacrifice. &#8220;I think the boys in Korea would appreciate it more if we in this country were to pay our own way instead of leaving it for them to pay when they get back,&#8221; said House Speaker Sam Rayburn. Until Iraq, that is. &#8220;Nothing is more important in the face of a war than cutting taxes,&#8221; then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay declared in March 2003.</p></blockquote>
<p>One can review the ratio of Federal debt to GDP from 1934 through today by looking at table B-79 of the <a href="http://www.gpoaccess.gov/eop/tables08.html">Economic Report of the President</a>.  While this ratio rose from 54.2% in 1939 to 121.7% in 1946, at least some of the cost of fighting World War II was borne by higher taxes during the war.  The debt to GDP ratio actually declined during the Korean and Vietnam Wars.  But during the Iraq War, Americans got to pay less in current taxes so the debt to GDP ratio has increased.  This Administration rejected the principle of shared sacrifice.  And even though John McCain advocates both a continuation of the current war and more wars in the future, he wants to cut taxes even further.  Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton would not be pleased.</p>

<p>After speaking with my insurance company, I am told the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is considered an &#8220;Act of G-d&#8221; (clearly, the OT version of same)</li>
<li>Since the damage is almost all on my neighbor&#8217;s property (their fence, their swing set, their garage), it&#8217;s not covered under my policy.</li>
<li>Since my policy doesn&#8217;t cover &#8220;land,&#8221; that big mud puddle that used to have a tree in it is also not covered.</li>
<li>Since it&#8217;s an AoG, there is no point in filing a &#8220;liability claim&#8221; to cover damage to my neighbor&#8217;s property.</li>
</ol>
<p>We&#8217;re inclined to believe that my neighbor&#8217;s insurance company will agree with this assessment.</p>
<p>I suspect many homeowners are about to find out that their insurance policy does not do all that they thought it would.  Can a truly rational market exist in the face of persistent informational asymmetries?</p>

                                <p>I have said a number of times in posts and comments here that the numbers on Social Security are all extremely important, because paradoxically little of the debate about &#8216;crisis&#8217; is number driven at all. Instead I want to argue that it is fundamentally an attempt to tell a story to sell a particular set of policy proposals, that of &#8216;private&#8217; or &#8216;personal&#8217; (the terms overlap but are not synonomous) retirement accounts to ultimately replace Social Security.</p>
<p>In this case we have a number of top level &#8216;crisis&#8217; narratives with any number of sub-stories. But first we have to develop the characters who fall into five demographic cohorts. (The limiting birth dates for each may not line up precisely with those used by demographers, but my argument is only to a limited degree demographic to start with). So we have the Greatest Generation with birthdates from 1910 to 1928, the Depression/War Babies 1929 to 1945, the Baby Boomers, 1946 to 1964, Gen-X from 1965 to 1983, and the Millennials from 1984 to 2001. In our first story who is the villain and who the victim?</p>
<p>Well the villain is pretty clear, it is the Baby Boomers whose pending retirements are simply going to wreck the system (so the story goes).  The notion that Boomers are inherently selfish was not invented by privatizers, instead they latched onto a theme that had been developing since about 1964 when the first Boomers arrived on college campuses. Immediately and at an accelerating pace Boomers were swept up in a massive series of societal changes that in toto put paid to the middle class consensus as it had developed in the fifties. For the next twenty two years it was going to be our music, our fashion, our sensibility that would rule the day. Now certainly those sensiblities changed as we moved from tie dye and acid to cocaine and hot tubs in the seventies, but the overall message stayed the same: &#8216;Don&#8217;t trust anyone over 30&#8217; (until of course we started turning 30 in 1976). Did we deserve being called self-absorbed, I daresay we did. But did we deserve the label of &#8216;selfish&#8217;. Well not in the event. Because things didn&#8217;t and are not turning out as planned.</p>
<p>There are two top level narratives about Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217;. One is &#8216;Crisis at Trust Fund Depletion&#8217;. The other is &#8216;Crisis at Social Security Shortfall&#8217;. Analysis and discussion under the fold.</p>
<p>The more traditional model of &#8216;crisis&#8217; is placed at Trust Fund Depletion which is to say that date at which the Treasury Department has fulfilled all its legal obligation to redeem Trust Fund security instruments. And that is an important point, privatizers like to talk about &#8216;Unfunded liability&#8217; over the Long Term 75 year window and now over the Infinite Horizon, and to be fair the Trustees also use it as a term of art. But to my best understanding it is not at all a &#8216;liability&#8217; in the legal sense. When and if first Pay/Go fails us requiring us to tap the interest and then that fails to keep up requiring us to repay principal well when we come to the end of the road that is where it stops. At that point Social Security is legally on its own to pay whatever it can out of current tax income. Now it may be that society as a whole will feel a social obligation to backfill benefits, and there may be political pressure to do so, and people may or may not be confident we can pick up the subsequent bill, but none of those are absolute obligations. Which leads us to our first three narratives: Crisis of the Naive, Crisis of the Concerned, and Crisis of the Cynical.</p>
<p>Crisis of the Naive. Certain advocates of privatization from the President on down have used reckless language like &#8216;bankrupt&#8217; and &#8216;flat broke&#8217; to describe Social Security after Depletion with the result that large numbers of Americans who still to this point probably command majorities have translated to &#8216;no check&#8217; and &#8216;Social Security won&#8217;t be there for me&#8217;. This is off course nonsense, as long as there exists a FICA payroll tax benefit checks can continue to be paid to some level, these people simply haven&#8217;t been given the conceptual tools to think this through, and privatizers are not exactly rushing to clear this fundamental issue up. So we can leave the Naive behind.</p>
<p>Crisis of the Concerned. These people probably understand the above point, but believe the needed cuts will be too deep and that we will have a moral requirement to make the scheduled benefit. Well color me unconvinced. The current schedule would deliver a benefit in 2041 that is 160% in real terms relative to ones similarly situated retirees get today. This is because initial benefits adjust to real wages and the fact is that taken as a whole this country has gotten wealthier over time. Will this process always continue? Well maybe not but right now the official line is that in 2041 the system will deliver 78% of the scheduled benefit, and given that 78% of 160% = 125% it is far from clear to me that this is necessarily a call to action. Particularly since most proposed &#8216;fixes&#8217; just phase those cuts in earlier and don&#8217;t materially advance the economic interest of the typical retiree at mid-century. Feel free to argue in comments why I should take benefit cuts from 2023 to 2041 that end up delivering the same result as taking full benefits and having a one time reset (past efforts at telling this story have not been at all convincing, but give it a shot.</p>
<p>Crisis of the Cynical. These people are just blowing smoke. They make the argument that our villainous Selfish Boomers will look at that 125% check and demand the full 160% be continued no matter what and enforce that demand with their superior numbers with the battle cry &#8216;Screw everyone else! I want mine! And I want it now!!&#8217;, and then the Cynics follow up on that by claiming the result would ruin the country. Well this just ignores the historical record. It was the Greatest Generation and the War Babies that allowed the Trust Fund to drop below 100 in 1971 and then go to zero levels in 1983. Boomers might at that point have been ruling the streets and most of the campuses but many of us were not even old enough to meet age requirements for Congress. We didn&#8217;t screw the pooch on this one, that would be the two cohorts before us. And when the time came we stepped up to the plate. By 1984 almost all Boomers were in the workforce and those who had followed the election knew the 1983 Reform was at best a partial fix, for us at least. But we did fix it for our parents lifetime. We may not have listened to them when we were growing up, but neither did we send them out to sea on an ice floe, no we paid in extra for most of our working lives with no guarantee we would get full benefits out. To call us &#8216;selfish&#8217; is kind of to miss the mark. Nor in the years since have I seen any real evidence that Boomers simply don&#8217;t give a shit about our children and grand children, yeah it is a good story line to sell to resentful Gen-Xers who think to themselves &#8216;My Uncle got to go to Woodstock and all I got was a T-Shirt with &#8216;Just say No&#8217; on the front and &#8216;Abstinence Only&#8217; on the back&#8217;, but it all rests on a misconception of what Social Security is actually promising. They still look to get a pretty good deal, it just might not be as great as planned (but still may-Low Cost is out there).</p>
<p>Two more points on the Cynical. The original narrative of circa 1997 worked out a lot better. At that point Trust Fund Depletion was scheduled for 2029 and indeed the outlook had been darkening. And this would have left Boomers ranging from 65 to 83, not only in our prime voting years but according to the mortality tables still likely to be around. To that degree the sub-story that had us storming Capitol Hill at least made some sense. Fast forward to 2008, now our ages at Depletion in 2041 would be 77 to 95 and the mortality tables suggest that time would not be on our side. The people likely to be in a position to raise a ruckus are going to be those same resentful Gen-Xers, the Boomers will have paid their own freight on this one.</p>
<p>Last point on the Cynical. As noted nothing requires us to backfill that 78% to 100% of the schedule, but pretending it would be a huge burden ignores the fact that the cost of paying off the last installment of Trust Fund obligations in 2040 and early 2041 is almost exactly that of continuing to fund it out of straight General Fund transfers. In either case the gap remains the same. If we do decide to backfill it we just keep borrowing at the rates we had done since about 2035, if we decide not to backfill it and take the 125% the result is a large (but not huge tax cut). Taken from the standpoint of the typical income taxpayer, crisis at depletion actually is the functional equivalent of paying off an amortized mortgage, a large annual obligation simply vanishes off the books.</p>
<p>So that is Crisis at Depletion, on examination it just melts away. Which is why privatizers in recent years pivoted to Crisis at Shortfall.</p>
<p>Crisis at Shortfall equally falls into multiple parts. The basic story is that the key point is not when the Trust Fund exhausts its legal claims on the General Fund, but when the General Fund has to start paying interest (2017) and then principal (2023) but it splits after that. One camp simply tries to tell the &#8216;phony IOU&#8217; story, and pushed pseudo-legal arguments that the government can&#8217;t owe debt to itself and the fact that the Special Treasuries being not negotiable makes some sort of difference. Well neither is true though people can take their best story telling shots in comments. Because when I talk with some of the top privatizers they freely admit the claims are valid and that they have never said otherwise. (Though I don&#8217;t see a lot of active effort to shut the bogus argument lines down.) Instead the more sophisticated Crisis at Shortfall people simply argue that however valid those obligations may be, actually honoring them in practice would require large tax increases and slashes in other government programs. Well nice appeal to liberal guilt there, but in point of fact the initial transfers are very small and don&#8217;t ramp up until sometime after 2027, which is plenty of time to start a planning process. The notion that we need to take action NOW! is a simple fairy tale told by some clever story tellers. Put the numbers in actual context and the narratives of crisis simply dissolve into fairy dust.</p>

The ability these guys have a slipping back and forth from nominal to real is never ending.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08572t.pdf">GAO 08-572T Testimony</a> has an interesting observation which needs thinking about.</p>
<p>There are good reasons that this testimony and the testimony in 621T are not supported by released GAO studies.  Those being the investigators would likely need to call in the guys with gold badges, and government officers would go to jail.</p>
<blockquote><p>Page 11, &#8220;Contractors are generally not subject to the same ethics rules as government employees even when they are collocated and work side by side with federal employees and perform similar functions.&#8221;  The paragraph goes on to observe that contractors can unethically influence government decisions.  That is true especially when there are no government personnel who understand what the contractors do, nor can adequately evaluate their “work”.</p></blockquote>
<p>This leaves the DoD acquisition system open to significant scrap and rework which is observed by GAO each year.</p>
<p>The contractors are not the only cause but they pose a significant contribution to the waste and abuse within DoD acquisition.</p>
<p>Worse, the GAO reports quoted above imply, and my experience supports the fact that support contractors are not replacing government employees doing commercial activities but the contractors are doing near governmental functions.  Further, working side by side doing similar tasks implies a personal services relationship which is not in the scope of any services contract I know of.  </p>
<p>GAO 08-621T observed that on average 45% of program offices surveyed are wrongly manned by contractors and it did not state the fact that many of those contractors are the technical side of the program management office.  The program staff needs government contracting personnel with their warrant, but their warrants demand no concern for technical achievement or quality work.  The warrants are for paying the bills and do not ask if the work is right.  The support contractors pencil whip technical reports so they keep their jobs and the warranted personnel can feel secure in writing the acceptance and paying the bill.</p>
<p>The 45% contractors are heavily set in the quality assurance part and their lack of ethics there driven by the “conspiracy of hope” (that no one goes to jail, working fine so far) on the part of the 55% government personnel drives the waste and fraud in the defense acquisition system.</p>
<p>The taxpayer and the soldier would be better off if the 45% of program management office contractors were given pen knives and sent off to whittle beaks.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />This one by ilsm</p>

<blockquote><p>Accordingly, the NASA Office of Inspector General conducted an administrative investigation to examine reports of alleged “political interference,” predominantly by senior NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs officials, with the work of NASA scientists pertaining to climate change—to include whether NASA inappropriately prevented one of its scientists, Dr. James E. Hansen, from speaking to the media in December 2005.<br />Our investigation found that during the fall of 2004 through early 2006, the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs managed the topic of climate change in a manner that reduced, marginalized, or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public through those particular media over which the Office of Public Affairs had control (i.e., news releases and media access). We also concluded that the climate change editorial decisions were localized within the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs; we found no credible evidence suggesting that senior NASA or Administration officials directed the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs to minimize information relating to climate change. To the contrary, we found that once NASA leadership within the Office of the Administrator were made aware of the scope of the conflict between the Office of Public Affairs and scientists working on climate change, they aggressively implemented new policies with a view toward improved processes in editorial decision-making relating to scientific public affairs matters.<br />Further, it is our conclusion that the NASA Headquarters Office of Public Affairs’ actions were inconsistent with the mandate and intent of NASA’s controlling legislation—the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 19581 (Space Act) and NASA’s implementing regulations—insomuch as they prevented “the widest practicable and appropriate dissemination” of information concerning NASA’s activities and results. While we could not substantiate that Administration officials employed outside NASA approved or disapproved or edited specific news releases, we do, however, find by a preponderance of the evidence2 that the claims of inappropriate political interference made by the climate change scientists and career Public Affairs Officers were more persuasive than the arguments of the senior Public Affairs officials that their actions were due to the volume and poor quality of the draft news releases.</p>
<p>1 The National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, Pub. L. No. 85-568, 72 Stat. 426 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 2451 et. seq. [2007]).<br />2 Preponderance of the evidence is a standard of proof that simply requires that the matter asserted seems more likely true than not.</p>
<p>Although the scientific information alleged to be “suppressed” appeared to be otherwise available through a variety of Agency forums, we cannot reconcile that the Space Act would permit any purposeful obfuscation of scientific research by the Agency in any news dissemination forum as “appropriate” under the Act.</p></blockquote>
<p>No one has published the <em>draft news releases </em>for us, however.</p>

<blockquote><p>By overlooking the problems created by trade in instances where regulatory arbitrage does play an important role, we miss the opportunity to celebrate the kind of globalization where such arbitrage doesn&#8217;t play a role. The latter type of trade probably constitutes the bulk of world trade. But because economists do not make this important distinction, they have no language or ability with which they can respond appropriately to the uneasiness out there&#8211;except for calling it irrational.</p></blockquote>
