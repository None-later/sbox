<p>The Senate&#8217;s global warming bill was defeated last week.  The measure aimed to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 70 percent by mid-century through a cap-and-trade program.  Cap and Trade is just one of the mitigation attempts to keep CO2 emissions below 450 Parts Per Million (PPM)s.  We are now getting some meaningful estimates for the capping of CO2 world-wide, and they are not pretty. </p>
<p>Recently we had an article by Tom Bozzo about the costs of a Cap and Trade system for CO2 in the US.  Titled &#8220;Some Fairly Pleasant CO2 Arithmetic&#8221;, and in comments he said that the current trading price was in the $3 to $6 per ton range. </p>
<p>Concurrently we had a Report issued by the International Energy Agency which estimated the total world-wide cost for mitigating CO2 by 50% by mid-century at $45 Trillion.  </p>
<p>We have had a chance to pull back the covers on the IEA Report.  An analysis by Dr Roger Pielke Jr, at his Prometheus site gives us this: <br />
<blockquote>If we take the report&#8217;s marginal cost estimate of $200 to $500 per ton for mitigating carbon dioxide, then a simple estimate of the full costs from a frozen technology baseline would be an additional $210 to $530 trillion above the $45 trillion cited in the report. Yes, you read that right.</p></blockquote>
<p> (Emphasis mine!)  he goes on to describe what he meant by a &#8220;frozen technology baseline&#8221;, and frankly it was included to describe the extreme uncertainty in these kinds of estimates.  Describing a more realistic scenario, he conjectures<br />
<blockquote>What if the assumption of automatic decarbonization was off by only 10%? Then the additional cost would be an additional $21 to $53 billion, or about the same magnitude of the IEA&#8217;s total cost estimate of mitigation</p></blockquote>
<p>With numbers such as these, is the arithmetic quite so happy about CO2?  The Senate bill may very well have failed because these issues became public knowledge and more fully understood by some of the Senators.</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>Some of you may remember that there once was a time when a gaggle of relatively centrist Republican governors from the Upper Midwest a la Wisconsin&#8217;s <a href="http://www.myspace.com/tommythompson08">Tommy Thompson</a> and Michigan&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Engler">John Engler</a> were thought of as a AAA farm team for national Republican office.  As it turns out, up here we&#8217;re dealing with longstanding fiscal problems from this particular brand of &#8216;don&#8217;t tax but spend anyway&#8217; Republicanism, and one of the stranger metastases is a long-running and (on one side) <a href="http://www.thedailypage.com/isthmus/article.php?article=8991">exceptionally idiotic partisan battle</a> in the Wisconsin legislature over the state&#8217;s support for the University of Wisconsin system.</p>
<p>More below the fold.</p>
<p>When driving up to the Twin Cities, we&#8217;d joke at rest stops about the (modern and clean) Tommy G. Thompson Memorial Bathrooms.  (Considering that Thompson was governor for 14 years and a notional supporter of passenger rail, another legacy is our unimodal ground passenger transportation system, but that&#8217;s for another time.)  But the macro feature of the Thompson-era budgets was a massive <a href="http://www.wistax.org/news_releases/2004/0409.html">increase in spending on prisons</a> offset by <a href="http://www.news.uiuc.edu/II/03/1120/budget.html">reductions in state support</a> for the University of Wisconsin system, a pattern broadly repeated throughout the Big Ten.  There were votes in locking up small-time (and mostly non-white) drug offenders, but otherwise this is a crude and cruel parody of a long-term pro-growth policy.</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s the picture from the UW system&#8217;s 2006-07 biennial operating budget request [<a href="http://www.uwsa.edu/budplan/opBudget/opBudgetArchive/final_06-07_budgetdocument.pdf">pdf</a>]:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dAYXCP-wxFE/SFJrGQ0NYeI/AAAAAAAAAA0/wzKlF96uC_4/s1600-h/Picture+7.png"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_dAYXCP-wxFE/SFJrGQ0NYeI/AAAAAAAAAA0/wzKlF96uC_4/s400/Picture+7.png" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>That $1.044 billion is 24% of the operating budget (that&#8217;s for the whole system, not just the Madison campus); in the 1970s, the figure was around 50%.</p>
<p>Even capital spending is increasingly privatized.  One of the <a href="http://www.madison.com/tct/news/stories/291306">big projects</a> that&#8217;s keeping area non-residential construction afloat, the Wisconsin Institutes of Discovery (a multidisciplinary facility intended to capitalize on the UW&#8217;s position in stem-cell research) is more than half-funded by a large private gift and the <a href="http://www.warf.org/about/index.jsp?cid=6">Wisconisn Alumni Research Foundation</a> (which manages patents and other IP generated from UW research); state money is around a third of the bill. </p>
<p>I see an opportunity if big elite-university endowments were to be forced to operate in the general-public interest as a condition of maintaining their tax-exempt status. Why should Harvard get all the glory via the <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/05/greg-mankiw-wan.html">Harvard University of California at Berkeley</a>?  <a href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/econ/grad/bulletin/admisenv.htm">Lake Mendota</a> may not be quite as scenic as San Francisco Bay, but it&#8217;s more usable for recreation, and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/education/08yale.html">Yale</a> University of Wisconsin at Madison would be a relative bargain.</p>

It seems he was against privatization before he was for it.  Fine – but could he at least tell us the truth about the long-run solvency position of Social Security.  In early 2005 – President Bush broke what had been his 2004 silence on this issue (wouldn’t have been prudent to campaign on this issue) and went on a nation wide campaign to push for his privatization plan.  McCain joined him in Arizona and told residents of McCain’s state that the Social Security Trust Fund would be “broke” by 2041.  I wrote the Senator suggesting this claim was not even remotely true.  His staff was kind enough to reply with a letter that had a very accurate description of the long-run solvency issue.  And it seems this letter was signed by Senator McCain.  Only problem – the letter directly contradicted what the Senator told his own voters.  Maybe he was confused.  Or maybe he was willing to lie to residents of Arizona.  I report – you decide.</p>
<p>Update: Over at Mark’s place, one comment gives us a link to what President Bush told this Arizona office on <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/03/20050321-7.html">March 21, 2005</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>You see, in 1950, there was 16 to 1 workers &#8212; 16 workers for every beneficiary paying into the system. It means each worker didn&#8217;t have much of a load to carry when it came to making sure that somebody who has retired got their benefits. Today, there are 3.3 to 1 &#8212; 3.3 workers paying into the system. Soon, there will be two workers paying in the system. More people getting greater benefits, living longer, and fewer people paying for us. That&#8217;s a problem. And it&#8217;s a problem that begins to manifest itself in 2018, when the Social Security system goes into the red.   Now, let me tell you something about the Social Security system. It&#8217;s not a trust. A lot of people think, well, we&#8217;re collecting your money and we&#8217;re holding it for you, and then when you retire, we&#8217;re going to give it back to you. That&#8217;s not the way it works. We&#8217;re collecting your money, and if we&#8217;ve got money left over &#8212; in other words, if the &#8212; if there&#8217;s more money than the benefits promised to be paid in our hands, we&#8217;re spending it and leaving behind an IOU. That&#8217;s how it works. It&#8217;s called it&#8217;s a pay-as-you-go system. You pay, we go ahead and spend it. (Laughter.)  In 2018, the system goes into the red, and every year thereafter if we don&#8217;t do anything, if we do not address the problem, it gets worse and worse and worse. To give you an example, in 2027, the system will be $200 billion in the red. In other words, $200 billion more to pay for the retirements promised to people like me who are living longer than coming in in payroll taxes. And it&#8217;s $300 billion about 12 years later. In other words, we&#8217;ve got a problem out there.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110:S.3101:">The Baucus-Snowe bill S.3101 Medicare reform</a> in the Senate is up for a vote.  This aspect of the Social Security programs has not been discussed in depth here, and mostly put aside as a problem to fix.</p>
<p>Is anyone knowledgeable?  Let me know.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.opencongress.org/bill/110-s3101/show">Open Congress</a> has some information.</p>
<p>Update:  Our esteemed Ken Houghton had this to say on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/did-part-d-work.html">Medicare Part D</a> a few weeks ago.</p>

<blockquote><p>What IS relevant, is add up ALL social spending, <strong>HHS, Medicaid, Medicare, Welfare, SS&#8230; and then subtract it from the budget</strong>. Compare that to all tax revenues. You will find that when it is subtracted from the budget, there will be a surplus.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now THAT is a program reduction. I assume we keep the rest?  Are regulatory agencies included?</p>

<p><a href="http://newmarksdoor.typepad.com/mainblog/2008/06/as-i-post-this.html?cid=118495588#comment-118495588">Newmark&#8217;s Door</a> comments on news and Iraq:</p>
<blockquote><p>More than a few people are noticing that we may be winning the war in Iraq, and that the consequences of victory will be large and far-reaching. Michael Yon, who&#8217;s observed Iraq, first-hand, a lot more closely than most U.S. journalists and politicians, believes that &#8220;We are winning because of who we are, and Al Qaeda is losing because of who they are.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Washington Post editorializes, &#8220;Don&#8217;t look now, but the U.S.-backed government and army may be winning the war.&#8221; </p>
<p>Abe Greenwald explains why this is important.</p>
<p>After years of telling us the war on terror was creating more terrorists, the mainstream media has mysteriously woken up to the fact that Islamic extremism is on the wane. Newsweek is the latest publication to run a support-for-jihad-is-fading piece&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>cactus replies in comments:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the mid-1990s, we had a domestic equivalent to Al Qaeda a few years back . We had the militia movement, that spawned the Oklahoma City bombing. Along the way, it got feted by a few Republican congresscritters from Idaho and Michigan, as I recall, but that&#8217;s another story. </p>
<p>High profile actions taken against any of these home grown low-budget terrorists and wanna-be terrorists, from Ruby Ridge to Waco, did only one thing: it made their message of a big bad gubmint out to put everyone in a UN run concentration camp look more credible, at least to nutjobs similar to the ones already involved in the militia movement. Which meant the whole thing grew until one of the those @$$holes blew up a building full of innocent people and killed a lot of people.</p>
<p>Even the exceptionally feeble-minded folks who voted for Helen Chenoweth began to understand there was a difference between the fantasy represented by all this talk about black helicopters and chips implanted in people&#8217;s foreheads and the reality of some crazies who would have no problem in killing them for no particular reason and attributing it to &#8220;collateral damage.&#8221; And then&#8230; the process very quickly flamed out. No race war, no uprising, no battles against the government&#8217;s minions in city streets, and most certainly no more support from the public. It helped, of course, that the government kept a relative low profile &#8211; no more surrounding compounds full of armed lunatics who would barbecue themselves at the whim of some wild-eyed prophet. Instead, they treated it like law enforcement. Would be martyrs were arrested, and not given the opportunity to go out in a blaze of &#8220;glory.&#8221; </p>
<p>End result &#8211; the rapid end of the militia movement, no more than about five years after just about anyone had ever heard of it. Total death toll not counting members of this traitorous movement &#8211; in the low hundreds. </p>
<p>Al Qaeda, like the militia movement, like the Red Brigades, like the PFLP, like the Weather Underground, like who knows how many other movements of disaffected sociopaths, will run its course. Its just a lot of people decided it would be clever to act in a way that ensured this movement would be around for that much longer, and cause that much more harm. But now, as was inevitable all along, History is reasserting herself.</p>
<p>And the folks who were wrong all along, the folks who gave us the corners that were turned over and over and over, who promised us a Surge was going to leave our pet klepto in charge of the entire country, the folks who talked about thieves and religious fanatics alternately as if they were pieces on a chessboard or friends of ours, the folks who gave these thieves and religious fanatics who hate us our money, the folks who told us about generational struggles, in short, the very folks who made the problem worse, who drove up the cost in blood and treasure and prestige and goodwill, are now declaring victory. Wow.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/politics/2008/view/2008_06_12_John_McCain_on_impending_war_of_words/srvc=home&#038;position=0">Hillary Chabot</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>GOP presidential contender John McCain says he can’t control every attack ad aimed at Democrat Barack Obama and fully expects he’ll face a similar barrage, sounding the bell for a raucous general election brawl.  “I can’t be a referee of every spot run on television,” McCain told the Herald in an exclusive interview. “I admire Sen. Obama and his accomplishments, but we all know there are groups who want to attack me.”  The Arizona senator’s hands-off posture on attack ads by now-infamous tax-free and unaccountable political groups called 527s marks a softening of his view on the negative campaign tactic &#8211; and opens the door to a no-holds-barred five-month scramble.  In 2004, McCain strongly condemned 527 ads attacking then-Democratic presidential contender John Kerry’s war record.</p></blockquote>
<p>Time out!  Yes, McCain did say that attack ads were wrong.  But President Bush allowed them to continue anyway.  Now had McCain been a person of principle, he would have refused to campaign for Bush-Cheney given that the Swifties were continuing their support for Bush-Cheney with these brazen lies.  But let’s turn the microphone over to <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/06/mccain_i_cant_stop_outside_gro.php">Greg Sargent</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama&#8217;s finance team has explicitly instructed donors not to give money to those groups. McCain, by contrast, seems to be saying that he can&#8217;t control the groups on his side.  If McCain can&#8217;t stand up to the 527s, how is he going to take on Al Qaeda?</p></blockquote>
<p>Clearly, Senator Obama is taking this clean campaign pledge a lot more seriously than Senator McCain.  It strikes me that McCain knows the only chance for him to win in November is to let this campaign turn negative.  So when McCain says he wants a clean campaign – let me suggest that this is just another lie from the GOP nominee.  He wants it both ways – he wants to pretend to be above the nastiness but he’s quite willing for his minions to do the dirty work for him.  Like I said – a weasel.</p>

                                <p>Angrybear has invited comments from all sorts including sensible conservatives and certain trolls who are nothing more than apologists for the Bush Administration.  Incidentally, I sense that sensible conservatives really grow tired of being associated with the apologists for the Bush Administration.  Who can blame them?  There is an advantage to this openness – it allows us an early read of the GOP talking points for the 2008 elections such as this claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>the debt is coming from your social programs, not from the war spending. It is your social collectivism that is piling up the debt for future generations to pay.</p></blockquote>
<p>You see – those tax cuts and all that defense spending are not the reason why Bush has high deficits, it is all those alleged increases in domestic spending such as “social programs” (whatever that means.).  OK, we do have some story from over two years ago by <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-03-13-federal-entitlements_x.htm">Dennis Cauchon</a> of USA Today, which is the troll’s only “evidence”:</p>
<blockquote><p>A sweeping expansion of social programs since 2000 has sparked a record increase in the number of Americans receiving federal government benefits such as college aid, food stamps and health care. A USA TODAY analysis of 25 major government programs found that enrollment increased an average of 17% in the programs from 2000 to 2005. The nation&#8217;s population grew 5% during that time.</p></blockquote>
<p>But wait – what about inflation and does the population growth track the growth in enrollment?  Click on the link and you’ll enrollment grew faster than the general population (maybe something to do with demographics).  In fact, we see later in the same story:</p>
<blockquote><p>Spending on these social programs was $1.3 trillion in 2005, up an inflation-adjusted 22% since 2000 and accounting for more than half of federal spending. Enrollment growth was responsible for three-fourths of the spending increase, according to USA TODAY&#8217;s analysis of federal enrollment and spending data. Higher benefits accounted for the rest … Robert Greenstein, head of the liberal Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, says the growth in the number of people in many programs is due to a rise in the poverty rate from 11.3% in 2000 to 12.7% in 2004, the most recent year available. &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly better that people falling into poverty can get Medicaid, but I&#8217;d prefer fewer poor people and employers not dropping medical coverage,&#8221; he says.</p></blockquote>
<p>A graph displayed by <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/09/hey-big-spender">Paul Krugman</a> makes a mockery of this abuse of 2005 data to reflect what’s going on in 2008 as 2005 was a bit of an aberration with the ratio of domestic discretionary spending as a share of GDP being lower in 2008 than it was in 2001.  Paul would have us check out <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/2-20-08bud.htm">this analysis</a> from CBPP, which includes this observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2008, funding for domestic discretionary programs outside homeland security is lower as a share of the economy than it was in 2001.  And, between 2002 and 2008, the overall funding level for domestic discretionary programs outside homeland security declined 2.6 percent in real per capita terms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Using annual data from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">this source</a>, I decided to look at overall Federal revenue (including payroll contributions) and overall Federal expenditures (including Social Security benefits) to see how much of the swing from (unified) surpluses to deficits is attributable to tax cuts, defense spending increases, and changes in nondefense spending.  In 2000, Federal revenues were 20.9% of GDP but they were only 19.3% of GDP in 2007.  In 2000, defense spending represented 3.8% of GDP but was 4.8% of GDP in 2007.  All other Federal spending as a share of GDP rose from 15.2% in 2000 to 16.1% in 2007.  Yet certain Bush apologists wish to pin all of the blame for the Bush deficits on nondefense spending.  Seriously – are these apologists really this ill informed or are they just as dishonest as their masters?</p>

<p>More on the B-2 crash.</p>
<p>In July 2006 the B-2 program office put itself in the an award <a href="http://bus.utk.edu/utpbl/documents/2006%20PBL%20Awards%20Information/System/AF%20Atch%202%20%20B-2%20Nomination.pdf">for applying Performance Based Logistics (PBL)</a>.  Seems in Fall 2006 they planned to hire Northrop to perform the B-2 PBL.  On page 5 of the award justification the program office touts innovations in support including management of technical orders:  &#8220;For the first time, the B-2 will have quantitative performance metrics for six major sustainment efforts: programmed depot maintenance, software maintenance, contractor supply chain management, sustaining engineering, technical order management and contractor parts repair management.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if the PBL includes penalties for crashing an aircraft because the &#8220;quantitatively measured&#8221; technical orders were not so hot?</p>
<p>PBL is an often misunderstood concept which arose in the late 1990&#8217;s as defense managers discovered their new systems were neither very reliable nor very easy to repair because they had spent huge sums and had not bought good technical data nor developed decent repair processes.  So, a Defense Systems Affordability Council (DSAC) began to look at weapon systems where the government hired the contractor to do total support often in cases where neither reliability nor maintenance processes were successfully delivered.  The idea was, and there is no evidence to support it, that if the government could not afford or the developer failed to make detailed, effective maintenance processes the same contractor would do it as part of a services contract.</p>
<p>GAO looked at the concept twice and then stopped because they were coming up with attacks on the brilliant idea to send huge amounts of money to the contractors to redo work they failed at in the first attempts.</p>
<p>GAO on Performance Based Logistics are here:  <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04715.pdf">GAO-04-715</a> and <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d05966.pdf">GAO 05-966</a></p>
<p>Both GAO reports are highly critical of PBL, stated PBL does not deliver and costs too much, which is consequently about not delivering the services or results.</p>
<p>We go from B-2 writing awards for PBL of its Technical Orders to the Air Force accident board excusing shoddy technical order management by the PBL contractor as ‘human error’.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />This one by ilsm</p>
