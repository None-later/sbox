                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I just learned about a blog called <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/06/mccains-advisor-says-bush-doesnt-understand-economics">EconomistMom</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am reminded about the President’s own take on this; he once quipped at a press conference that he got a B in Econ 101 but “an A in cutting taxes” (or something like that).  I’ve never looked into whether it’s true that he even got a B.  Anyone know?  UPDATE:  The Huffington Post had answered this question last September.  The President actually got a C in economics, not a B.  Also, the quote from the President was actually:  “I think I got a B in Econ 101. I got an A however in keeping taxes low, and being fiscally responsible with the people’s money.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She was relating a story as to how Douglas Holtz-Eakin – economic advisor to John McCain – was critical of George W. Bush’s understanding of economics.  Good for Douglas!  But then she related <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/06/holtz-eakin-in-hot-water-with-concord">another story</a> as to how Douglas was arguing in favor of McCain’s own spend-and-borrow-but-never-tax nonsense and how the Concord Coalition is calling him on this BS.  </p>
<p>The <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/05/premierepost">premier post</a> of Diane Lim Rogers – Economistmom and the first chief economist of The Concord Coalition – was about fiscal responsibility.  This may sound corny – but we should all listen to mom!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/2008/04/02/forbes-global-2000-biz-2000global08-cz_sd_bz_0402global.html?partner=careersaol">Forbes</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>In total, the global 2000 companies now account for $30 trillion in revenues, $2.4 trillion in profits, $119 trillion in assets and $39 trillion in market value. Around the world, 72 million people work for these companies.<br />&#8230;<br />The U.S. still dominates this list of global giants, but with 61 fewer entries than last year and 153 fewer than in 2004, as many U.S. companies failed to keep pace with global competitors. In contrast, China, India and Brazil are rapidly adding companies to the list. India, for example, has 48 companies this year vs. 27 in 2004.</p>
<p>Measured by number of companies, 315, the banking industry has the biggest presence on the global 2000. Banking also dominates in assets, with total assets of $58.3 trillion, and profits, $398 billion. The 123 companies in oil and gas operations lead all industries in aggregate revenues, of $3.76 trillion, and take second place in total profits, of $386 billion.</p>
<p>For the past few years, we have also identified an important subset of the global 2000: big companies that also have exceptional growth rates. To qualify as a global high performer, a company must stand out from its industry peers in growth, return to investors and future prospects. Most of the 130 global high performers have been expanding their earnings at 25% a year or better&#8211;easy for a start-up, hard for a blue chip.</p>
<p>One such exceptional company is HSBC Holdings (nyse: HBC &#8211; news &#8211; people ), which not only leads this year&#8217;s global 2000 in size&#8211;by moving past Citigroup (nyse: C &#8211; news &#8211; people ), which we now rank 24&#8211;but also is one of five global high performers in the banking industry. HSBC has delivered 26% annual average growth in revenue and 31% in net income over the past five years&#8211;results that seem more suited to a growing regional bank than one operating in 83 countries with 10,000 offices and $2.3 trillion in assets.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update: There are implications that should make us pause.  Some speculative thoughts are:<br />1.  Business ethics and idealogy are stripped of cultural and societal concerns, so cannot replace national interest and culture.  It is not the concern of business to care for citizens, so why give business this trust?<br />1.  Economic theory as sold in political circles and business as practiced in the world appear to have less in common than we think.  As long as enough voters believe that a stripped down version of living and society is adequate, that business and society are similar enough, then we will continue to lose ground as a nation.  The transition to a global economy might be good or bad from our own point of view, but current planning appears shabby at best and deceitful at worst.<br />2.  When GM and Ford move headquarters to some other country to be nearer sales territory, and other CEOs buy first homes elsewhere and have second homes in the US,  the symbolic value might get voters to re-define trade as something that is not a US prerogative.<br />3.  World companies in a global economy have no loyalty to nations.  Preferences, yes.  Subsidiaries to deal with cultural differences, yes.  Domination of a nations protections, yes. Loyalty, no.  People have loyalties.  Losing your vacation home is easier than losing your primary residence.<br />4.  &#8216;Defense&#8217; dollars are currently given away or wasted in a business sense.  A B-2   buys us nothing in a business sense, and things like naval policing are &#8216;free&#8217; to the world as a % and a drag on our resources unless we get to charge a world economy for it.<br />5.   It is really important to know where to throw the bricks when your water and food are at stake, unless you can move a lot.  Regular people are capable of much, but it goes both ways. Where is the new group of writers describing the new world order&#8230;Rand grew up in an extreme environment&#8230;do we have to wait for our kids to grow up in a different extreme before we get another novel and idealogy?  I do not think &#8216;enlightened&#8217; is used much in any context, government or business.</p>

                                <p>If you are like me and still have not read the 1972 book by David Halberstram, check this  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A54795-2005Jan6.html">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kennedy&#8217;s aides &#8220;carried with them an exciting sense of American elitism, a sense that the best men had been summoned forth from the country&#8221; to bring &#8220;a new, strong, dynamic spirit to our historic role in world affairs, not necessarily to bring the American dream to reality here at home, but to bring it to reality elsewhere in the world.&#8221; This was &#8220;heady stuff,&#8221; Halberstam writes, and it came to grief. The term &#8220;best and brightest&#8221; has become an insult, not an accolade, thanks largely to Halberstam&#8217;s magnificent, scabrous epic about the policymaking blunders that swept the United States into Vietnam. This classic work is part of the Vietnam canon, but it is not really about Vietnam; it is very much a Washington book, focused on the surety of the hawks stateside rather than the misery and warfare in Indochina &#8230; The final reason for rereading The Best and the Brightest ought almost to go without saying: It&#8217;s simply impossible to open the thing today and not hear the echoes of Iraq. To take just one example, when the State Department&#8217;s George Ball warned JFK that Washington would soon have 300,000 troops in Vietnam, the president laughed and said, &#8220;George, you&#8217;re crazier than hell.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But check out the preface:</p>
<blockquote><p>It was a shameful thing to ask men to suffer and die, to persevere through god-awful afflictions and heartache, to endure the dehumanizing experiences that are unavoidable in combat, for a cause that the country wouldn’t support over time and that our leaders so wrongly believed could be achieved at a smaller cost than our enemy was prepared to make us pay. No other national endeavor requires as much unshakable resolve as war. If the nation and the government lack that resolve, it is criminal to expect men in the field to carry it alone.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who would have thunk that this was written by <a href="http://cunningrealist.blogspot.com/2008/05/shameful-thing.html">John McCain</a>?</p>

                                <p>Is <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YjI0ZjFhYWNlZTg5ZDgwMDg0ODdjZThhMzU3ZjQ5ZjI=">Michael J. New</a> guilty of stupidity or mendacity?</p>
<blockquote><p>Proposition 13 limited property taxes in California to one percent of assessed value and placed tight limits on how quickly assessments could increase. Overall, Proposition 13 triggered an immediate property tax reduction of $6 billion and to this day provides homeowners in California some much needed tax relief &#8230; The passage of Proposition 13 was clearly a substantial victory for taxpayers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone who purchased a house in 1976 and still lives there is certainly getting a low effective property tax rate.  But newcomers are stuck with effective tax rates equal to this 1 percent.  Suppose you are about to bid $500,000 for a house that the current owner purchased back in 1976.  His Prop 13 appraisal is likely only $100,000 so he’s paying only $1000 a year in property taxes. But you’ll pay the full $5000 a year.  So to suggest all homeowners get “needed tax relief” suggests that Mr. New either does not understand California’s property tax regime or he is not very honest.  </p>
<p>To say that this chaotic aspect of California’s tax laws is providing relief in general for taxpayers shows Mr. New does not comprehend the California fiscal situation.  California has made up for the loss in property tax revenues by having high tax rates elsewhere.  And yet the state has a long-term fiscal shortfall.  Why?  That brain dead provision imposed by Prop 13 as to what it would take for Sacramento to change California’s tax laws.</p>

<p>B-2 Spirit Bomber Totaled.</p>
<p>The phone rang in the pentagon.  The Air Force general on the line called home to tell Dad he wrecked one of his shiny new toys.</p>
<p>Last Feb on Guam a B-2, which flies by wire. controlled by software, pitched up without input from the flight controls, drag exceeded lift, the crew ejected safely and airplane impacted ground at far more &#8220;G&#8217;s&#8221; than it was designed to survive.  Totaled in an inelastic collision.</p>
<p>CNN reported:  That an informal operating technique used by some crews and support personnel was not used, so there is no local &#8220;blame&#8221;.   The blame was &#8220;moisture&#8221; and should be considered systemic. <br />&#8220;This technique was never formalized in a technical order change or captured in &#8216;lessons learned&#8217; reports. Hence, only some pilots and some maintenance technicians knew of the suggestion,&#8221; according to Carpenter&#8217;s executive summary of the accident.<br />The report said, &#8220;The human factor of communicating critical information was a contributing factor to this mishap.&#8221;<br />Buffpilot and I know something about these things.  He was a bomber pilot on B-52.  I was a maintainer in a number of different aircraft over the years of my early career.  <br />I have problems with the stated conclusions.  People working on airplanes must follow the technical orders, that is, do no more or less or they are violating a directive designed to maintain safe operations.  That some procedures were done over and above the technical order is a deviation from procedures.  That the procedures were needed at other locations and not documented is another system failure.  Human factors is not my conclusion.<br />Work done on all aircraft has to be meticulously recorded, even those carrying civilians from Hart Field.  What happened with the B-2 fleet is work was being done on an aircraft which was not technically reviewed, not proven good and not documented so that if it were beneficial it could save the B-2 from crashing.<br />I was going to leave it at that but I need to relate that not only was a procedure not documented, but a failure mode or situation which destroyed the airplane was not identified, even in the $20B spent designing and testing the thing.  There is an engineering failure here as well.<br />Possibly they ran out of funds to model all the things that can crash the airplane in the environment, hardware, software and what humans can impact.<br />The issues in the Air Force are far deeper than human factors on some flight line.<br />Losing a $1.4B asset for vague failures is worrisome and the Air Force&#8217;s problems were not fixed by a couple of resignations. <br />Whittling beaks sometimes gets in the way of getting real work done.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />This one by ilsm</p>

<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121269958227749853.html?mod=todays_columnists">Peggy Noonan in the WSJ</a> offers a thanks on Clinton:</p>
<blockquote><p>But this I believe is the truth: America dodged a bullet. That was the other meaning of the culminating events of this week.<br />Mrs. Clinton would have been a disaster as president. Mr. Obama may prove a disaster, and John McCain may, but she would be. Mr. Obama may lie, and Mr. McCain may lie, but she would lie. And she would have brought the whole rattling caravan of Clintonism with her—the scandal-making that is compulsive, the drama that is unending, the sheer, daily madness that is her, and him.<br />We have been spared this. Those who did it deserve to be thanked. May I rise in a toast to the Democratic Party.<br />They had a great and roaring fight, a state-by-state struggle unprecedented in the history of presidential primaries. They created the truly national primary. They brought 36 million people to the polls, including the young, minorities and first-time voters. They brought a kind of dogged brio to the year.<br />All of this is impressive, but more than that, they threw off Clintonism. They threw off the idea that corruption is part of the game, an acceptable fact. They threw off the idea that dynasticism was an unstoppable dynamic in modern politics, that Bush-Clinton-Bush-Clinton could, would, go on forever. They said: &#8220;No, that is not the way we do it.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>They threw off the idea of inevitability. Mrs. Clinton didn&#8217;t lose because she had no money or organization, she didn&#8217;t lose because she had no fame or name, she didn&#8217;t lose because her policies were unusual or dramatically unpopular within her party. She lost because enough Democrats looked at her and thought: I don&#8217;t like that, I don&#8217;t like the way she does it, I&#8217;m not going there. Most candidates lose over things, not over their essential nature. But that is what happened here. For all her accomplishments and success, it was her sketchy character that in the end did her in.<br />But the voters had to make the decision. So, to the Democrats: A nod. A bow. Well done.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sammy thought the essay great.</p>
<p><a href="http://now@now.org/">NOW and President Kim Gandy</a> also say thanks:</p>
<blockquote><p>Join us in sending a salute to Hillary Clinton, who said on June 3: &#8220;I made you &#8212; and everyone who supported me &#8212; a promise: to stand up for our shared values and to never back down. I&#8217;m going to keep that promise today, tomorrow, and for the rest of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>NOW President Kim Gandy wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Hillary, you have made a mark on history for eternity, giving little girls and little boys the full knowledge that women can compete, take risks, take the heat, make hard decisions, and be strong leaders. Whether you are President, Vice President, on the Supreme Court, serving as the Senate Majority Leader or just plain being the best-ever senator for New York and for all of us, we will be with you &#8212; as we work together for equality for all, and a better, safer, more peaceful world for everyone, not just the privileged few. Yes, we will. Thank you, Hillary.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Rdan here. I think she made a woman running for President feel almost normal. After a huge amount of media and scrutiny, however, I think she listened to the wrong adviser on her presentations.</p>

<p>I am only a few pages into the 82 page Report but my initial response is that this is a very important deal. These people do seem to be actual independent observers fully willing to call them as the see them and  seem to have identified a lot of the weaknesses in methodology that we here at AB see (for example that Low Cost has all variables moving in the same direction). Arne might be particularly interested in that they are proposing a duplication of something he is working on, which is to say a combination of Low Cost economic assumptions with Intermediate Cost demographics, I am sure he will want to compare notes.</p>
<p>I am going to take my own advice and actually read the thing before commenting, but I suspect this will be required reading for any serious commentary. BTW this Report only comes around every four years, and it looks like a substantial departure from the 2003. My reaction will come in comments a little later or tomorrow.</p>

                                <p>by Reader Arne (lifted from comments)</p>
<blockquote><p>TJ asks &#8220;Either Retirement Security is a societal imperative &#8230;&#8221;<br />An interesting proposition, but has little to do with SS.</p>
<p>Consider a cohort of 65 year old guys just reaching retirement. To simplify the math, assume they all need the same amount to live on. In the absence of SS, how much do they need to have in savings?</p>
<p>If each of them assumes they will live 17 years and budgets precisely, half of them will run out of money. If they pool their money (and all live within same budget) there will be money left at the end. In other words, the amount a cohort needs to insure themselves against not having enough if they live longer than expected is less than what the cohort needs if they act as individuals. Retirement insurance is a winning proposition for the cohort.</p>
<p>SS is greatly more complicated, but one of the underlying reasons that SS works is that retirement insurance is mathematically a winning bet.</p></blockquote>
<p>Update:  Arne says:<br />
<blockquote>I suppose if I had known my comment was going to become a post I might have been more careful in my wording. My point was that retirement insurance is good for each individual independent of whether it is good for society. You don&#8217;t need to be of a mind to help those who cannot help themselves, retirement insurance is good for those who just want to help themselves.</p>
<p>The way SS is implemented does partake of social imperative and political compromise, but it is soundly grounded in self-interest.</p></blockquote>
<p>Short and sweet.  Good for many many people, and proudly paid for by the insured.</p>

<p>The econ as science was a success as an open thread and blossomed into a great discussion.  Now, we at Angry Bear have been accused of hyper partisnship and perhaps being an echo chamber.  Can that be differentiated from an identified strong point of view?</p>
<p>Bias will always be present in a discussion&#8230;when is it productive is my question, and when not?  And does it overgeneralize, and how does one diagnose such?</p>

                                <p>Paul Krugman says we need a <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/06/we-need-a-new-business-cycle-vocabulary">New Business Cycle Vocabulary</a>.  His first graph shows this point:</p>
<blockquote><p>Official recession definitions used to correspond closely with labor market outcomes, because we had “V-shaped” recessions: when they were over, everything sprang up quickly. Here’s the employment-population ratio and recession periods from 1973 to 1990:</p></blockquote>
<p>His second graph shows this point:</p>
<blockquote><p>As far as the job market was concerned, the last two recessions lasted literally for years after they were officially declared over.  Now we have what looks and feels like a recession that, from the point of view of the labor market, started before it officially began.  The point, I think, is that the traditional definition of recession only worked well in the face of a jagged business cycle; if we now have smoother, longer curves — maybe due to better inventory management, or whatever caused the Great Moderation — the question, “Is this a recession?”, no longer means much.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul even has an explanation for that improvement in the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/jump-in-unemployment-rate-bad-news-but.html">labor force participation rate</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today’s employment report wasn’t as bad as the markets seem to have thought: the big jump in the unemployment rate was due to a jump in labor force participation — maybe by teens looking for gas money? — rather than a large drop in employment. The economy still seems to be in a sort of slow-mo slump: employment gradually falling, labor markets gradually worsening, GDP positive but barely.</p></blockquote>
