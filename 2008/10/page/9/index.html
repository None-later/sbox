                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>Going to the Forbes site is very instructional. Immediately, I was confronted with a picture of Gates and Buffet, with the caption: &#8220;Who&#8217;s Richer? Warren or Bill? Click to find out!&#8221; Unfortunately, I was interested in what <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/09/19/ap5447500.html">Forbes</a> had to say about Ohio&#8217;s unemployment rate, which they got from a Reuter&#8217;s feed:<br />
<blockquote>The state says Ohio&#8217;s unemployment rate jumped to 7.4 percent in August, up from 7.2 percent in July. It&#8217;s the highest rate in 16 years. Ohio&#8217;s unemployment figure tops the national rate of 6.1 percent. The last time Ohio&#8217;s unemployment rate hit 7.4 percent was in Oct. 1992.</p></blockquote>
<p>The juxtaposition was darkly humorous, to say the least. And since I am not on a first name basis with either Warren or Bill, I did not click to find out. (And, if truth be told, neither Warren nor Bill can hold a small coin next to the really wealthy&#8211;you, know, the Rothschild&#8217;s.)</p>
<p>I was interested in Ohio&#8217;s employment. This kind of unemployment story is where America is; where America is going: Higher unemployment, lower wages.</p>
<p>Tax cuts for those below $200,00 and hikes for those above $200,000 make for good press. But we all have heard about the massive redistribution of wealth going to the top 1%; that is not going to change.</p>
<p>A friend of mine asked: &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s going to happen? What is the solution?&#8221;</p>
<p>I told him: &#8220;You have to see everything in a global context. America just keeps looking at its navel, wondering what happened to the umbilical cord. Americans are constantly feted as the most competitive, the most innovative people on the face of the planet. Just listen to our news media.</p>
<p>Such sound bites may warm your heart, but they will not put food on the table or pay the bills. If you cannot look beyond Wall Street or beyond the stock market or beyond Ohio, you will be forever staring at that stubby navel.&#8221;</p>
<p>Right now, there is nothing the American worker can do to regain his once exalted global status. Let&#8217;s look at some of the proposals now on the table.
<ul>
<li>Cut corporate tax to make us more competitive. Sorry, we cannot compete. See Stormy post <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/new-tax-law-in-china-implications.html">here</a></li>
<li>Close the influx of illegal immigration. (Surprising how quickly any real effort there went off the table. Heard much about it lately? We didn&#8217;t want those jobs anyway, did we?)</li>
<li>Insist that the American worker become better educated. Hmmmm and how are we going to pay for that one? We still have to compete with highly skilled Indian and Chinese labor. It is quite cheap, I hear. For an in-depth look at IBM&#8217;s approach and understanding see <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/question-for-council-on-foreign.html">here.</a></li>
<li>Invest in infrastructure. The effect will be temporary. It brings a number of problems. Big One: How do we pay for it? Will it make us more competitive? (Besides, the world does not quite have the same shape as it did when massive public works projects were the vogue. And, by the way, are we going to put them up for bid, via the old buddy system, Haliburton-style, that we have come to love and adore. Or will we outsource them to China, which is doing a bang up job in Africa. Or are we going to have the U.S. government the employer? )</li>
<li>Extend unemployment insurance. I can&#8217;t even bring myself to address that one. While it reveals a heart of gold, how are we going to pay for it?</li>
<li>Print lots of money. Deflate the debts.</li>
<li>Require that China compensate us for the trade deficit. (We really could use the money, especially now.) Yes, we did have a guest post on that one.</li>
</ul>
<p>The difficulty that I see with most discussions of the issue&#8211;from the right and from the left&#8211;is that few can see past the present crisis, which is just the beginning.</p>
<p>As usual, we simply react to crisis. <i>All of the above demonstrate short-term thinking, reactions problems that suddenly seem to appear.</i> What? Employees are losing their jobs? Let&#8217;s extend unemployment insurance! And so it goes.</p>
<p>Many readers most probably think I was nuts talking about China and car parts. (See &#8220;Auto Parts? China? Africa? Next Question&#8221;.) What does that have to with the price of corn on Mars?</p>
<p>Well, China happens to be a big part of the global economy; we rushed to it with arms open, expecting riches beyond belief. Our trade deficit with China continues to increase&#8230;albeit slowing. And do you really think that China will tank along with the U.S. and Europe, tank as disastrously?</p>
<p>For those of you who thought I was fixated on the future of car parts, try again. I was pointing out the obvious: Who is the main driver of this small part of the Chinese economy? And, is this particular industry a microcosm of what has been happening in China?</p>
<p>I have heard endless talk that China will not be able to &#8220;sterilize&#8221; all those dollars, about subsequent crushing inflationary pressures on the Chinese economy. I am still waiting.</p>
<p>Connect these dots:
<ul>
<li>CEO wages have been going through the roof&#8211;not just inside banks.</li>
<li>Average wages here are stagnant at best.</li>
<li>China enjoys a massive trade surplus with the U.S., a trade surplus driven by FDI and the presence of foreign firms in China.</li>
<li>Every decision a businessman makes is driven by one concern: Profit.</li>
<li>Wages and taxation and transportation are central to his equations.</li>
<li>Trade surplus is a good thing.</li>
<li>According to Yi Xiaozhun, foreign enterprises enjoyed 83% of China foreign trade surplus. See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/what-about-us-investment-abroad.html">here</a> for a discussion.</li>
</ul>
<p>China, right now, is well positioned: Flushed with cash and a growing export platform. Yes, it will slow down. <i>But no one is catching up.</i></p>
<p>You asked for globalization. You got it in spades. Any solution I would propose&#8211;and I have proposed one&#8211;would be greeted with howls. Consequently, I will forego my suggestion and offer a hope instead: Hope that China can quickly become a global market for things other than raw material. Hope that its standard of living rises sufficiently fast enough to rescue ours. Otherwise, look around for a rice field.</p>
<p>But remember: Even China admits that it is a good 100 years behind the U.S. And start reading about how China is planning its future. (See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/04/china-now-to-2100.html">China: Now to 2100</a>)</p>
<p>Me? I will try to stay away from the Forbes site. I just get too angry. If I had my way, all those rich dudes&#8211;everywhere&#8211;, would have to empty their coffers and stop pretending to be philanthropists.</p>
<p>By the way, someone is going to make a fortune when the stock market hits bottom. We still need car parts.</p>

                                <p>Steve Benen at <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_10/015194.php">The Washington Monthly</a> points to a WSJ article that cautions us:</p>
<p>THE ULTIMATE BUSH LEGACY FOR BIG BUSINESS&#8230;. Bush&#8217;s presidency may be winding down, but he&#8217;s not quite done with his conservative domestic agenda.<br />
<blockquote>Bush administration officials, in their last weeks in office, are pushing to rewrite a wide array of federal rules with changes or additions that could block product-safety lawsuits by consumers and states.</p>
<p>The administration has written language aimed at pre-empting product-liability litigation into 50 rules governing everything from motorcycle brakes to pain medicine. The latest changes cap a multiyear effort that could be one of the administration&#8217;s lasting legacies, depending in part on how the underlying principle of pre-emption fares in a case the Supreme Court will hear next month.</p></blockquote>
<p>This amazing piece, from the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Alicia Mundy, hasn&#8217;t generated a lot of attention so far today, and that&#8217;s a shame. The administration&#8217;s efforts on this are likely to have a huge impact.<br />
<blockquote>Corporate America has been calling for some mechanism to &#8220;preempt&#8221; product-liability litigation for years, and Bush had promised to deliver. The White House, however, had limited options in dealing with a Democratic Congress which cares about consumer protections.</p>
<p>So, the Bush gang is adding provisions to obscure federal regulations that will block product safety lawsuits by consumers and states. The scheme would affect products ranging from cars to prescription medication to railroad cars.</p>
<p>But a possible Obama administration can undo this, right? If Obama wins, he&#8217;d no doubt want to, but reversing these regulations would take a long while.</p>
<p>These new rules can&#8217;t quickly be undone by order of the next president. Federal rules usually must go through lengthy review processes before they are changed. Rulemaking at the Food and Drug Administration, where most of the new pre-emption rules have appeared, can take a year or more.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article is online <a com="" article="">here</a>, and an WSJ video with Mundy talking specifically about how this affects state lawsuits is here. Take a look.</p>

<p>Immune to the global slowdown, Chinese auto parts industry delivers record numbers. By Bertel Schmitt, CEO <a href="http://www.sinamotive.com/">Sinamotive Group</a> (HK) Limited. </p>
<p>While markets all over the world tank, while auto maker flirt with bankruptcy, the Chinese auto parts industry goes full steam ahead. In the first seven months of 2008, China’s auto-parts exports skyrocketed by 34.9% year on year (y/y) to $8.88 billion, says a report released by China’s Customs Bureau.</p>
<p>China exported $ 8.73 billion worth of auto-parts from January to July 2008.<br />Most of this growth was driven by companies that usually complain the most about Chinese imports. Foreign invested companies and joint ventures exported $4.56 billion of auto-parts, up 31.6% y/y, amounting to 51.4% of the total. </p>
<p>Where are Chinese auto parts most popular? In the U.S., in the EU and Japan. The U.S.A. took parts for $2.69 billion ( 8.8%), Europe imported parts for $1.6 billion ( 39.2%), Japan sourced parts for $1 billion ( 36.8%). These three markets alone accounted for 59.6% of the total value of China’s Jan-Jul auto-parts exports. </p>
<p>This validates the previous predictions made by our company: </p>
<p>1.) The parts market, especially when targeted at after sales, is recession-proof. </p>
<p>2.) Europe takes an ever increasing amount of Chinese parts. Exports to the U.S.A. still grow, but at a more leisurely pace. </p>
<p>3.) The main drivers of this growth are foreign companies, who use China as a low cost production base and sell the product under their own brand name at high margins. </p>
<p>4.) Expect further sales increases due to falling raw material prices and sinking shipping costs. This is especially true in the after sales sector. Auto makers may also buy even more Chinese parts. They aim to off-set their diminishing sales with higher cost savings with parts, sourced in China. </p>

<p>The great game continues. While the West frantically tries to cauterize the bleeding of its financial sector, China moves ahead, even though its yearly growth may slow to 8% because of faltering U.S. consumer demand.<br />

<p>To the consternation of U.S. trade officials, policymakers and private-sector trade groups, trade between Africa and China not only has exploded, but also continues to grow at a pace that eclipses the growth in trade between Africa and the U.S.<br />“It’s a subject that is attracting a considerable amount of attention among members, but there is no one opinion as to whether it is detrimental to U.S. interests, neutral, or if it’s a good thing,” said Tim McCoy, vice president at the Corporate Council on Africa, a Washington-based trade association that focuses on commercial relations between the United States and Africa.What it underscores, many say, is the need for a different U.S. commercial strategy in Africa. </p>
<p>“If we want to compete with China, we can build railroads, put in power infrastructure and telecommunications infrastructure,” said Shelvin Longmire, a veteran Washington-based international consultant. “We may not like the way they’re doing it, but I see China’s activities delivering substantive capital-intensive projects that are going to benefit (African) countries, versus what the West was doing: extracting resources without putting infrastructure in place.” </p>
<p>“With so many infrastructure projects under way in West Africa, this multipurpose offering gives us a real edge,” Verner Hammeken, Safmarine’s multipurpose-vessel manager in China, said at the launch of the service.Three African countries — Angola, Sudan and the Republic of Congo — are among China’s top 10 oil sources, with additional crude imported from Chad and Equatorial Guinea. But China’s huge appetite for Africa’s commodities goes beyond crude oil. There’s cobalt and other strategic minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo; timber from Mozambique; copper from Zambia; and iron ore and manganese from South Africa </p>

<p>Some thoughts on the bail-out:</p>
<p>1.  Goldman&#8217;s market cap is about 50 billion.  The gubmint is gonna buy $10 billion worth of (non-dilutive, non-voting) shares, for which it gets essentially, well, nothing.  Nothing at all.  Goldman will go about its business.  So&#8230; Goldman is getting an infusion equal to 20% of its worth, plus a guarantee that the gubmint will replace whatever excrement it purchased with something of value.  And somewhere along the line, you can bet that the gubmint will also end up doing the same favor to everyone who bought excrement Goldman sold.  Even a company that sold wedgies would make a mint with that sort of gubmint help. </p>
<p>2.  The bail-out will succeed only, repeat, only in the sense that the US succeeded in Iraq in 2003 and 2004 when Simone Ledeen and the rest of the Heritage interns were running around the country handing out trash bags full of money and giving Halliburton money for services it would never begin to render.  There will be less yabbering of silly catchphrases like &#8220;but what about all the schools that were painted?&#8221; this time around, though, because the schools will be exploding when GW is no longer in office.  To be extremely precise, this is what I think the success will look like: shady, undeserving characters will be enriched, young versions of the idiots who got us into the mess will launch successful careers (can you say &#8220;Kashkari&#8221;?), and the promised benefits to the American public, the schmucks footing the bill, will never materialize. </p>
<p>3.  The reason the bail-out won&#8217;t succeed, like Iraq, is that it doesn&#8217;t address a real problem.  Banks going under is not a problem.  Bankers having incentives to make risky decisions is a problem, and this bail-out will do nothing to stop it.  (Non-voting shares, remember?)  My guess is that we&#8217;ll find some entities (and I would bet money Goldman Sachs will be on that list) will be found to be gaming the system.  There will be a tsk-tsk when that comes to light, but they will not have to pay back the gubmint for gaming the system.</p>
<p>4.  The bigger problem, that there was a housing bubble, and that home prices cannot and should not stay as high as they have been is not addressed by the bail-out.  If it ever does get addressed, it will be addressed in a counter-productive way.</p>
<p>5.  The even bigger problem, that the American public has been stretched thin financially for years now and can&#8217;t afford the sort of consumption that makes up about two thirds of the economy is also not going to be addressed by the bail-out.</p>
<p>I hope I&#8217;m wrong, because I don&#8217;t see this coming out well.  I do have a proposal, a small one.  I figure if the gubmint doesn&#8217;t get any say in how banks do business (exactly why is it so important to keep the &#8220;talent&#8221; that created this mess in the first place?) and foots the bill, can we at least require every bank that takes government money to include the words &#8220;Welfare Queen&#8221; in its name?  I think it would be a very useful thing if Goldman Sachs were forced to call itself Welfare Queen Goldman Sachs.  It might make a few members of the voting public realize exactly how the system work.<br />_____________________________<br />by cactus</p>

<p> Lifted from comments at <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/10/informational-c.html">Economist&#8217;s View on a post about information cascades</a> (following the crowd&#8230;when does the crowd start?):</p>
<blockquote><p>I participated in a classroom project modeling the allocation of funds to community projects by a &#8220;city council&#8221; of students. There were five or six groups of us, and at the end of the allocation process we all presented our results.</p>
<p>In most groups, the members discussed how the money should be allocated among several choices &#8212; senior community support, teen job training, a battered women&#8217;s shelter, a swimming pool, a school breakfast program, cleanup of a local lake, that sort of stuff. In these groups, the final allocation of the money was very consistent from group to group.</p>
<p>I suggested a different approach in our group, similar to a silent auction. Each &#8220;councilor&#8221; was given control over a percentage of the available funds, and decided how much of his or her money should go to which project. Then we pooled our results to reach a final result that was radically different from the other groups&#8217; decisions.</p>
<p>A third approach I had considered (but our group agreed would take too long) was to view the projects not as competing, but as potentially a cascade where injection of funds at one point (perhaps teen jobs) could cascade down into the others (senior home support, lake cleanup, school lunch preparation) thus getting several uses out of each dollar.</p>
<p>My point? To a large extent the process used for deciding something determines what decisions can be made. Different process &#8212; different decisions. Not an earthshaking concept, but it keeps being forgotten.</p></blockquote>

<p>The &#8216;McCain Resurgence Plan&#8217; surges on (h/t <a href="http://gecon.blogspot.com/2008/10/mccains-economic-plan.html">Creative Destruction</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Current rules mandate that investors must begin to sell off their IRAs and 401Ks when they reach age 70 and one half years old. Those rules should be suspended to spare senior citizens from being forced to sell their stock just as the market is hurting the most. Under the emergency measure I propose, we will also cut the tax rate for withdrawals from tax-preferred retirement accounts to ten percent&#8230;</p>
<p>Fine, but this affects a small slice of the public and not necessarily those who are going to be hurt by the recession.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Small slice of the public&#8221; may be an understatement for the retirement plan changes.  Last time I checked, there was a 10 percent regular income tax bracket, and for 2008 a married couple has to have $16,050 in taxable income to clear it.  The top of the 15% bracket is $65,100.  So lower-income seniors get nothing except the right to defer tax-deferred plan withdrawals that they arguably cannot afford not to take, and most seniors get no more than 5 percent of their withdrawals.  The main beneficiaries are owners of tax-deferred retirement accounts that are so large that they can replace an income in roughly the top 25% (or better).</p>
<p>McCain<a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/Speeches/Read.aspx?guid=d51f366d-a4ba-4d55-99b5-0f1a39a67e20"> goes on</a>&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>It is essential that we avoid an exodus of capital from the market. Senator Obama yesterday offered up a proposal that would have the effect of encouraging early withdrawal of funds from 401(k) accounts, by suspending penalties through 2009. This is an invitation to capital flight, and therefore to continued instability in the market, at a moment when exactly the opposite is needed. Any family that takes part in this will not see the benefits of the market recovery that smart policy can help bring about. In my administration, we will instead revive the market by attracting new investment. I will cut in half the capital gains tax on stocks purchased and held for more than a year &#8212; from a rate of 15 to 7.5 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>These provisions do not make exactly make Team McCain look in-touch.</p>
<p>First, people are raiding their 401(k)&#8217;s because defined contribution plan balances are often the only significant &#8220;savings&#8221; they have.  &#8220;Joe Sixpack,&#8221; as a certain vice-presidential candidate likes to say, doesn&#8217;t have appreciable amounts of money in assets that are potentially subject to capital gains tax.  (See, e.g., the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/PUBS/oss/oss2/2004/scf2004home.html">Survey of Consumer Finances</a>.  In 2004, the median holdings for working families owning stocks and investment funds were $10,000 and $25,000, respectively.  But only 15 percent of all families owned stocks directly and 40 percent owned mutual funds, so majorities had nada.)  Eating one&#8217;s retirement capital is already a desperation measure, and Obama&#8217;s plan arguably relieves an injury following insults that are done deals.  Plus, Obama would keep in place the loss-of-income-tax-deferral disincentive and limit penalty-free withdrawals, so we aren&#8217;t talking carte blanche here.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is a fairness issue here, in that the &#8220;rich&#8221; — i.e. those with substantial financial asset holdings outside of retirement accounts — can dump their assets at will and McCain will if anything make the terms of such transactions more favorable.  It&#8217;s just us chumps with defined contribution plans who are tasked with riding out the crisis in McCain world.</p>
<p>Second, it&#8217;s not at all obvious what McCain could substantively mean by &#8220;capital flight.&#8221;  This, I suppose, is part of what has Brad DeLong <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/420662635/is-this-the-wor.html">scratching his head</a>.  Asset sales have to have two parties — the upshot is that someone exchanges money for an asset.  These transactions aren&#8217;t counted as savings in the NIPAs since all that happens is a change in ownership, and the macro statistics don&#8217;t care exactly who holds what.   Capital can&#8217;t be &#8220;fleeing&#8221; the market since someone has to buy in to complete the transaction, and desperate 401(k) raiders likely are not trying to invest their proceeds in foreign assets.  (That would be the rich dumping assets to stuff cash in tax havens.)</p>
<p>Third, if the stated policy aim is to keep people from selling assets, how on earth will reductions in taxes on asset sales — note that another part of the McCain plan is to increase capital losses that can be counted against income — do that?  The naive incentives of the plan make it a bit easier to sell, unless McCain is offering something other than the long-term capital gains rate cut that he seems to be selling.  Rich people who are sitting on long-term gains see their tax rate go, as Maynard of Creative Destruction puts it, from minuscule to infinitesimal.  So maybe that gun is set to run out of ammo anyway.  But when the case is made for capital gains tax cuts raising, or at least not losing, much revenue, the argument always seems to involve an element of capital gains realization timing: people time their asset sales to take advantage of the more favorable tax terms.</p>
<p>In any event, it is maybe not so surprising that a campaign of millionaires and lobbyists can&#8217;t put together a plan that isn&#8217;t a giveaway to themselves.  So the clown show at a train wreck goes on&#8230;</p>

<p>Concerned about the cause of the Dow?  Not to fear.  Many have been working on it such as <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/10/13/obama/index.html">Glenn Greenwald</a>.The market does not like someone who is not like them so goes the Mc Cain clan.  It is possible, but then Glenn asks for proof and finds <a href="http://godly-fumigation.blogspot.com/2008/10/lies-damned-lies-and-statistics.html">an economist</a> of his nature who has discovered it is all due to McCain!  He has produced a chart proving it.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SPSc1ge7eEI/AAAAAAAAAIk/C6CUaRCh9yY/s1600-h/Fun-with-charts.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SPSc1ge7eEI/AAAAAAAAAIk/C6CUaRCh9yY/s400/Fun-with-charts.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m convinced.  But, I&#8217;m going to wait for Cactus&#8217; review of this man&#8217;s work.</p>

<p>There seems to be a fair amount of anger in some corners about Krugman&#8217;s Nobel.  A few thoughts about the complaints:</p>
<p>1.  Kary Mullis believes in astrology.  William Shockley was certain that black people were inherently mentally inferior to white people.  Mullis received a Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), the technique used to make copies of DNA.  Being brilliant in one field doesn&#8217;t guarantee one isn&#8217;t a complete idiot in another field.  So whether you think Krugman&#8217;s political views are nuts, or Mullis&#8217; views on astrology and extraterrestrials is insane, or Shockley was a racist scumbag, it has nothing to do with whether they deserved the prize they received or not.</p>
<p>2.  Most people who criticize Krugman don&#8217;t seem to like the fact that he&#8217;s been calling GW&#8217;s policies stupid for the past eight years.  Considering that none of GW&#8217;s policies actually worked as advertised (remember the debt that was going to be paid down, or how the economic boom of the 90s was going to continue?), Krugman would be less, not more worthy, of a Nobel if he hadn&#8217;t been railing against the stupidity. </p>
<p>3.  I actually agree that Krugman has, at times, let his political views lead him a short way down the same path Mankiw have taken on the right.  (See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/my-2-cents-on-krugman-piece.html">here</a> for a contemporaneous comment criticizing Krugman.)  But my suspicion is that the Krugman and the Mankiw paths differ on one key aspect – Krugman seems willing to attack the side he sees as the greater of two evils come what may, whereas Mankiw seems willing both to attack the side he sees as the greater of two evils and to defend the side he sees as the lesser of two evils come what may.  I never met the man, but I don&#8217;t expect him to be a staunch defender of any sort of stupidity coming from an Obama administration, or any other Democratic administration for that matter.  My guess is he&#8217;ll call bull**** when he sees it, regardless of who peddles that bull****.  Its not Krugman&#8217;s fault that the folks Mankiw defends are the ones most likely to peddle bull****, and it doesn&#8217;t in any way invalidate Krugman&#8217;s work.</p>
<p>4.  Krugman, like the rest of us, is no doubt sometimes wrong.  But many of the attacks on Krugman are for not agreeing with unprovable philosophies about how the world should work.  Disagreeing with Krugman on an issue which you cannot defend with numbers and data does not make him wrong, much less invalidate the work for which he was awarded a Nobel.  And if your problem is that these days Nobels aren&#8217;t awarded to allergic-to-data Austrian school fellows, you should have been more upset that the prize for which such story-tellers are eligible went to Le Clézio this year. <br />______________________<br />by cactus</p>

Half of that will go into nine of the largest banks in the US. The rest will go to smaller banks and thrifts. Here are some details:<br />
<blockquote>The preferred stock that each bank will have to issue will pay special dividends, at a 5 percent interest rate that will be increased to 9 percent after five years. The government will also receive warrants worth 15 percent of the face value of the preferred stock. For instance, if the government makes a $10 billion investment, then the government will receive $1.5 billion in warrants. If the stock goes up, taxpayers will share the benefits. If the stock goes down, the warrants will be worthless.</p></blockquote>

<p>Vote.</p>
<p>I was taught, by example, how to vote. My parents got up in the<br />morning and dressed as though for church. The day was somehow quieter<br />than other days, even in a household with five kids.</p>
<p>We drove to the polling site and while one parent went in to vote, the<br />other would ride herd on us in the car, but it never took much effort<br />to keep us quiet. It was voting day.</p>
<p>Formal, sober, quietly determined, everyone in my hometown migrated to<br />the polls, and we kids were taught that the actual voting was both a<br />purely personal choice, and a secret. The secret might be shared, but<br />it was uncouth to ask &#8220;How did you vote?&#8221;</p>
<p>It was never said outright, I think, but we were shown that the vote<br />was sacred: &#8220;set apart for a special purpose&#8221;. My parents treasured<br />their vote, it was at once a right, and a privilege, and an<br />obligation.</p>
<p>To add one voice to the larger voice of the nation, and together say<br />in some mystical way what path the nation will take, is in its own way<br />a religious action, full of faith and determination and patience in<br />the face of a flurry of mere arithmetic.</p>
<p>To choose not to vote is an act of negligence or even despair – both<br />of them equally undermine our shared nation.</p>
<p>I vote for meat on my neighbour&#8217;s plate, not mine. For the health of<br />my neighbour&#8217;s children, the peace of our streets, the knowledge in<br />our libraries and the significance and beauty of our images and songs.<br />I vote for the strength of the whole, not the benefit of one walled<br />garden at the cost of a wilderness outside.</p>
<p>Arithmetic is the enemy of the vote. The vote is more than a grain of<br />sand on a scale, it is an action in which citizens make themselves<br />manifest as a part of the whole. To neglect it is to become a<br />political ghost, moving voiceless through the world.</p>
<p>An old woman who told stories, who was prisoner of the Nazis, who left<br />her Dutch home for a new home and language and land, told this story:</p>
<p>    &#8220;Tell me the weight of a snowflake,&#8221; a mouse asked a wild dove.</p>
<p>    &#8220;Nothing more than nothing,&#8221; the dove answered.</p>
<p>    &#8220;In that case I must tell you a marvelous story,&#8221; the mouse said.<br />&#8220;I sat on the branch of a fir, close to its trunk, when it began to<br />snow. Not heavily, not a raging blizzard, no &#8212; just like in a dream<br />without any violence the snow silently fell.</p>
<p>    Since I had time, I counted the snowflakes setting on the twigs<br />and needles of my branch. Their number was exactly 3,741,952 when the<br />next snowflake dropped onto the branch &#8211; &#8220;nothing more than nothing&#8221;<br />as you say &#8211; the branch broke off.&#8221;</p>
<p>    Having said that the mouse went away.</p>
