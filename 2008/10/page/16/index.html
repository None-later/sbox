                                <p>Almost a week ago—a few decades of Internet time, when people could still believe House Republicans might be sane—Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/the-tarp-plan.html">quoted the summary</a>:<br />
<blockquote>To provide authority for the Federal Government to purchase certain types of troubled assets for the purposes of providing stability to and preventing disruption in the economy and financial system and protecting taxpayers, and for other purposes&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>As noted, this was back before &#8220;other purposes&#8221; included cutting down more trees in Oregon or providing mental health benefits as part of insurance. So let&#8217;s just focus on the word that makes this facility different: <strong>purchase</strong>.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s put that $700,000,000,000 in a context (figures in $Billions):

<p>So we could buy four of the largest banks and the three somewhat-remaining large Investment Banks with change left over.</p>
<p>But that wouldn&#8217;t get market lending started again.</p>
<p>Will buying securities?</p>

<p>The Wachovia-Citigroup-Wells Fargo flap makes one wonder. Wachovia is about to go under; the FDIC arranges for Citigroup to buy Wachovia for 2.2 billion, while absorbing 42 billion of losses Citigroup will presumably incur.. Along comes Wells Fargo, offering Wachovia 15 billion.</p>
<p>Exploiting a presumed tax loophole, Wells Fargo makes a significantly better offer.</p>
<p>While it is true that there is a letter of exclusivity in the FDIC brokered deal, I am not interested in its legality or its force.</p>
<p>First, that tax loophole must be significantly large in order to make up the difference between the two offers. Citigroup&#8217;s offer is effectively 44.2 billion (2.2 billion plus the FDIC&#8217;s coverage of 42 billion in losses.) Subtracting the 15 billion Wells Fargo offer, we arrive at a tax loophole of certainly more than 29.2 billion.</p>
<p>I am certainly no expert in mergers and acquisitions, but I bet that Citigroup was well aware of that loophole and wanted to exploit it as well. In short, the FDIC had offered a real plum to Citigroup. That Citigroup may now be willing to risk a very expensive lawsuit in order have that plum speaks volumes. (While the letter of exclusivity mentions &#8220;irreparable harm,&#8221; how much harm could have been done in such a short period of time, especially when the deal had not finally been consummated.)</p>
<p>Additionally, if the FDIC is going to broker deals, shouldn&#8217;t it be aware of all the side-benefits? Or better yet, shouldn&#8217;t it slow down a bit, allowing other bidders to come forth? Or, maybe, the FDIC doesn&#8217;t work that way; doesn&#8217;t canvas all potential buyers. To be somewhat circumspect, maybe the FDIC uses the &#8220;personal&#8221; touch.</p>
<p>Finally, I just have to wonder about the last sentence in the final paragraph covering the story in today&#8217;s New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/05/business/05bank.html?_r=1&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;oref=slogin&#038;adxnnlx=1223207717-Nw5M4K/i5aoXbpRXhf5ZAw">piece</a>:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The litigation could put regulators in a tough spot. <i>The Wells Fargo deal may be better for taxpayers, but if it succeeds, in the future other financial institutions may not be willing to help the government, as Citigroup did, because of the risk that they might not reap the anticipated benefit</i>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Who exactly is helping whom here? Why will other companies be &#8220;unwilling to help the government&#8221;? I doubt that any of these companies are being particularly patriotic.</p>
<p>Maybe some more informed readers can help me out. Seriously. I am sure I must be missing something.</p>

<p>Now is not a good time. In fact, the credit crunch may affect areas important to moving ahead: from funding renewable energy sources to rebuilding infrastructure, from a stable local tax base to the creation of jobs through business investment&#8211;to say nothing of mitigating the growing effects of pollution and global warming. One side effect has been the creation of ever-larger entities in almost every area&#8211;perhaps a dangerous development&#8211;as smaller firms in almost every area are gobbled up. Increasingly, the national government, along with these huge firms, will play a larger and larger role. And how much can a government do, especially one that is seriously in debt?</p>
<p>Taking each of these areas separately, I see considerable difficulties.</p>
<p>Funding Renewable energy sources: Cash rich, large utilities will be in the <a href="http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/50447/story.htm">best position</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if utilities do have to borrow, they can do so cheaply as government-regulated businesses with guaranteed rates of return which can pass on costs to consumers, said analyst Pavel Mulchanov at Raymond James &#038; Associates in Houston. </p></blockquote>
<p>Europe may be better off than the U.S. in terms of renewables:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Monday, US lawmakers said they could run out of time to extend a wind power production tax credit (PTC) and a solar power investment credit (ITC), which have been powerful spurs for installations, in time for a Dec. 31 expiry deadline. </p></blockquote>
<p>What certainly will happen is that smaller firms, often the genesis for new ideas, will be absorbed. Start-up companies will be unable to find the necessary cash to get a foothold. Our choices for the kinds of renewables we pursue may increasingly be in the hands of larger and larger entities.</p>
<p>How these larger firms choose to allocate investment resources will be important. Will they make wise decisions or be simply governed by short-term returns?</p>
<p>Rebuilding infrastructure: As houses decrease in value, local tax bases will decrease, putting increasing strains on state governments. Once again, the national government will be asked to help, even as its tax base is slowly strangled. While national investment in infrastructure may create some jobs, without a better trade position, there will be little hope that infrastructure in the long run will be enough. Countries that are cash rich and that have good export markets will be better weathering the coming storm, as long as they export items that are essential.</p>
<p>Creation of jobs through business development: Most firms will head for the trenches. If we are worried about &#8220;float loans,&#8221; imagine the attitude towards actual investment. Even when the stock market boomed and the bubble grew, actual business investment inside the U.S. was mediocre. Firms saw better returns in emerging markets that offered cheap labor and tax subsidies. The chances of those firms returning to the U.S. are small&#8211;unless, of course, labor here becomes cheap enough&#8211;or the cost of transportation becomes prohibitive.</p>
<p>Pollution and global warming: If the argument for meeting these twin demons head-on was that it would adversely affect the bottom line, that argument now, regardless of how foolish, is even more persuasive. Pollution grows <a href="http://earthtrends.wri.org/updates/node/279">apace</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Gulf of Mexico may just be a glimpse into the future of coastal waters around the world, if this is the case. Already, dead zones have been identified across the globe, from the Scandinavian fjords to the South China Sea to the U.S.&#8217;s Chesapeake Bay. </p></blockquote>
<p>On the global warming front, don&#8217;t worry about buying hip waders. We know, of course, that Arctic ice mass continues to dwindle. We know also that for the first time as far as anyone can remember, both the Northwest and Northeast passages were simultaneously opened. Again, these are side issues. <i>The real thing to watch is the permafrost and the massive peat bogs in Russia.</i> The carbon and methane these areas hold exceed anything humanity could place in the atmosphere in the next seventy years. According to <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSL1076886120070917?sp=true">Sergei Zimov</a>, a Russian who has been studying climate change in the Russia&#8217;s Arctic,</p>
<blockquote><p>The deposits of organic matter in these soils are so gigantic that they dwarf global oil reserves&#8230;U.S. government statistics show mankind emits about 7 billion tonnes of carbon a year&#8230;Permafrost areas hold 500 billion tonnes of carbon, which can fast turn into greenhouse gases&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Zimov <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/312/5780/1612?ijkey=AtmokuIY/.zr6&#038;keytype=ref&#038;siteid=sci">the world&#8217;s carbon</a> reservoirs. (Note, to use the prior link, go <a href="http://www.faculty.uaf.edu/fffsc/NESciStaPapers.html">here</a>; otherwise, you will confront a subscription request.)</p>
<p>The following quotations of his study deserve careful reading:</p>
<blockquote><p>The carbon content of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere has increased from ~360 gigatons (Gt)&#8211;mainly as CO2&#8211;during the last glacial maximum to ~560 Gt during preindustrial times and ~730 Gt today. These changes reflect redistributions among the main global carbon reservoirs. The largest such reservoir is the ocean (40,000 Gt, of which 2500 Gt is organic carbon), followed by soils (1500 Gt) and vegetation (650 Gt). </p>
<p>There is also a large geological reservoir, from which ~6.5 Gt of carbon are released annually to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels. </p>
<p>Permafrost (permanently frozen ground) is an additional large carbon reservoir that is rarely incorporated into analyses of changes in global carbon reservoirs. Here we illustrate the importance of permafrost carbon in the global carbon budget by describing the past and potential future dynamics of frozen loess (windblown dust, termed yedoma in Siberia) that was deposited during the glacial age, covering more than 1 million km2 of the north plains of Siberia and Central Alaska to an average depth of ~25 m. </p>
<p>&#8230;we estimate the carbon reservoir in frozen yedoma to be ~500 Gt. Another ~400 Gt of carbon are contained in nonyedoma permafrost (excluding peat lands), and 50 to 70 Gt reside in the peat bogs of western Siberia. These preliminary estimates indicate that permafrost is a large carbon reservoir, intermediate in size between those of vegetation and soils.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then there is the methane, now hissing out of frozen and unfrozen lakes.</p>
<blockquote><p>The yedoma carbon beneath the thermokarst lakes is decomposed by microbes under anaerobic conditions, producing methane that is released to the atmosphere primarily by bubbling. Near eroding lakeshores, methane bubbling is so high that channels through the lake ice remain open all winter. During a thaw/freeze cycle associated with lake migration, ~30% of yedoma carbon is decomposed by microbes and converted to methane. As a potent greenhouse gas, this methane contributes to climate warming.</p></blockquote>
<p>The question ahead is: Do we have the resources to see our way through the coming difficulties, even if credit begins to become more available? Larger and larger entities will stand astride the globe. In the U.S., the U.S. government will be everywhere. For the U.S., the coming recession will be long and painful. It has become the provider of last resort. How intelligently it will be guided remains to be seen. Most importantly, will it have the wisdom and the fortitude to address directly the issues of pollution and warming at a time when tax dollars are desperately needed in other areas?</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I wrote a post below on how economic theory as presented to the public and economic theory are very different.  In particular, even given the standard super strong assumptions, economic theory does *not* imply that Laissez faire is the best policy, does not imply that market outcomes are even Pareto efficient (a very weak statement anyway) does not imply that financial innovation can&#8217;t hurt everyone and certainly does not imply that financial markets can&#8217;t freeze up.</p>
<p>In this post I will write about general equilibrium theory [more on that after the jump] and assume symmetric information.</p>
<p>Furthermore I will talk about Pareto efficiency.  [more after the jump].</p>
<p>I will assume that markets are incomplete.  This is obvious.  For markets to be complete, there must be a security (or portfolio) which pays positive value in any conceivable contingency and otherwise pays zero.  It must be possible to buy in effect &#8220;an umbrella if it is raining&#8221; separately from &#8220;an umbrella if it is not raining&#8221;.  No one has ever suggested that markets are approximately complete.  To have any connection with reality, general equilibrium theory must concern economies with incomplete markets.</p>
<p>All that aside the conclusions of the literature is that </p>
<p>1) Generically (definition of generically after the jump) the market outcome is not constrained Pareto efficient.  This means that the government can make everyone better off by restricting free market exchange on financial markets forbidding people to make mutually beneficial trades at a market clearing price.</p>
<p>2) If markets were complete the outcome would be Pareto efficient.  However the introduction of a new security does not necessarily cause a Pareto improvement.  In fact, for an open set of economies (definition after the jump) banning trading in a security causes a Pareto improvement.  Generically, if markets are incomplete, there is a security whose introduction will make everyone worse off.</p>
<p>3) with incomplete markets sunspots (variables which have no effects on tastes or technology) can cause prices to change.  Outcomes can occur with a sunspot that couldn&#8217;t possible occur without a sunspot.  I don&#8217;t remember if this is generically true of just true for an open set of economies.</p>
<p>4) it is easy to write down a model in which the volume of trade is zero.  In standard models agents who do not maximize welfare are introduced to cause trading volume to be greater than zero.  It is possible to write a model in which there is some trading even if everyone is rational (for example due to life cycle saving and dis-saving or people hedging against risk in their labor income).  No one writes such models as they give trading volume vastly lower than, say, current volume with markets that are &#8220;frozen&#8221; and have &#8220;seized up.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roughly none of the claims about general equilibrium with complete markets apply to general equilibrium with incomplete markets.  The exceptions are not strange cases, rather the claims are true only if there are extraordinary coincidences.</p>
<p>General Equilibrium theory is extreme even as economic theory goes</p>
<p>I will therefore assume that agents have rational expectations &#8212; that is they know the probability of any conceivable event &#8212; and that they are price takers, that is there is perfect competition.  I will assume that there are no non-pecuniary externalities like pollution (the only externality is that my demand affects the price that you have to pay too).  I will also assume symmetric information although there is a large literature (founded by Robert Lucas) on general equilibrium with asymmetric information).  Thus the assumptions are the very strong ones typically criticized by people who say that the support for laissez faire (libertarianism in English) from economic theory is irrelevant the real world.</p>
<p>Is it Pareto efficient is not an interesting question (as stressed I might add by Kenneth Arrow who proved the first welfare theorem and said it was no big deal).</p>
<p>This has little to do with efficiency in the normal sense of the word.  An outcome is Pareto efficient unless it is possible to make someone better off without hurting anyone.  Slavery was Pareto efficient if it helped the slave owners.  The statement that an outcome is Pareto efficient tells us essentially nothing.  In particular if we have two outcomes and one is Pareto efficient and the other isn&#8217;t that tells us nothing of interest.  It certainly doesn&#8217;t at all mean that the Pareto efficient outcome is a Pareto improvement over the other outcome.</p>
<p>uh oh. I have to define what general equilibrium theorists mean when they say &#8220;an economy&#8221;</p>
<p>1) an economy includes a set of agents each of which has a utility function.   The agents rationally maximize their expected utility.<br />2) Each agent has an initial endowment of goods and maybe abilities<br />3) There is a production possibilities set describing how goods and abilities can be used to produce goods.</p>
<p>In particular all the results mentioned above are for &#8220;fruit tree&#8221; economies in which no one works.  Instead the production is of the form of fruit trees which produce goods by themselves.  Typically the models have 2 periods (I think this assumption isn&#8217;t really restrictive).  In period zero people start with endowments of fruit trees.  They trade them.  One can short sell a fruit tree.<br />In period 1 the trees produce the fruit.  People exchange fruit.  Then they eat it.</p>
<p>Clearly this is a very special case of general equilibrium and the fact that the standard results for a 1 period model (no fruit trees) don&#8217;t hold is especially striking.</p>
<p>Open:  Actually this is an abstract concept.  Given a set we can define a &#8220;topology&#8221; which is the set of open subsets of the set.  The only rules are<br />1. the whole set is open<br />2. the empty set is open<br />3. The intersection of a finite number of open sets is open<br />4. The union of any set of open sets is open.</p>
<p>in general equilibrium theory &#8220;open&#8221; has a standard relatively narrow defintion.  It always (almost always ?) means that if we take an economy in the set, there is an epsilon so low that if we change the endowments of goods initially owned by agents so that the largest over i and j change in the endowment of good j owned by agent i is less than epsilon the new economy with new endowments is in the set of economies.</p>
<p>So something is true of an open set of economies means I can take a little from this guy and give to that gal and it will still be true.</p>
<p>dense:  a subset of a set is dense if for any point in the set, for any open set containing that point, there is an element of the subset in that set.  For example rational numbers are a dense subset of real numbers.</p>
<p>Generically:  Roughly something is true generically if it is true except in knife edge cases of extraordinary coincidences.  Consider the set of pairs of real numbers.  Generically the two numbers are not equal, only by an amazing coincidence would they happen to be equal.</p>
<p>Formally a statement is true generically if it is true for an open and dense subset of economies.  In practice what is shown is if we have an economy for which it is true we can make little transfers of endowements so small that it is still true after the transfers.  For any case in which it is not true for any epsilon, there are transfers where the biggest amount of any good given to or taken from anyone is less than epsilon such that after the transfers the statement becomes true.</p>
<p>Another way of saying it is that if we have a set and an open and dense subset, the complement of the subset (the points in the set which aren&#8217;t in the subset) has measure zero for any measure based on the topology of the set.</p>

<blockquote>Daily chart<br />House prices<br />Through the floor<br />May 29th 2008<br />From Economist.com</p>
<p>America&#8217;s house prices are falling even faster than during the Great Depression</p>
<p>AS HOUSE prices in America continue their rapid descent, market-watchers are having to cast back ever further for gloomy comparisons. The latest S&#038;P/Case-Shiller national house-price index, published this week, showed a slump of 14.1% in the year to the first quarter, the worst since the index began 20 years ago. Now Robert Shiller, an economist at Yale University and co-inventor of the index, has compiled a version that stretches back over a century. This shows that the latest fall in nominal prices is already much bigger than the 10.5% drop in 1932, the worst point of the Depression. And things are even worse than they look. In the deflationary 1930s house prices declined less in real terms. Today inflation is running at a brisk pace, so property prices have fallen by a staggering 18% in real terms over the past year.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>&#8230;even though we certainly need some bailing out.</p>
<p>Brad Setser <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/2008/10/02/give-the-fed-a-bit-of-credit/">notes the obvious</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Frankly the TARP is now starting to look small relative to the Fed’s balance sheet.</p></blockquote>
<p>while including the reality:<br />
<blockquote>The latest [H.4.1] data release should settle the question; absent enormous liquidity support from the Fed, a much broader set of financial institutions — including some that received equity investments from sovereign wealth funds — would have failed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which just brings us back to the question: if the TSLF, PDCF and related entities are doing their job—and there is no indication they are not—what will be the benefit of TARP?  (That is, if I can <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/tslf_terms.html">loan a security to the TSLF for 28 days</a>, and roll it over indefinitely [or at least until I get the price I want in the market], why would the Fed need to buy it, and why would I need the Fed to buy it?)</p>
<p>Continuing the thought, via Setser, <a href="http://www.iie.com/issues/009.htm">Morris Goldstein lays out the four major issues of the current credit crisis</a> [reformatted]:
<ol>
<li>illiquidity for certain mortgage-backed securities,</li>
<li>undercapitalization of the financial sector,</li>
<li>an interruption in the flow of credit to households and nonfinancial businesses, and </li>
<li>a rising foreclosure rate that threatens to produce a downward overshooting of housing prices.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first is a problem for the same reason that GM not selling too many Hummers is a problem: it&#8217;s where the profits were made.  Those &#8220;radioactive&#8221; tranches that were mostly sold to hedge funds were the most profitable part of the MBS.  The argument that it isn&#8217;t so much a liquidity problem as a price problem (demand is significantly down, and prices rarely go up in those circumstances) may be viable, but that leads to:</p>
<p>The second problem, some portion of which was a direct result of Christopher Cox&#8217;s mismanagement of the SEC&#8217;s oversight of investment banks, not to mention a lot of off-balance sheet maneuvering that ended up impacting bottom lines.  This is addressed fairly well by the TSLF, PDCF, etc.  But the problem persists, which leads to</p>
<p>The third problem, or the crux of the matter, without which we wouldn&#8217;t see <s>the former head of Goldman Sachs making plans to reward his friends</s> the Treasury Secretary talking about how overvalued assets are &#8220;undervalued&#8221; (assuming they reach maturity without high default rates) and need to be bought for two years, after which time all will presumably be fine and dandy again,* unless&#8230;</p>
<p>The housing market oversells (this point has been well-covered by AI <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/vacancy-http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5048766&#038;postID=3327095655018485471%3Cbr%20/%3EBlogger:%20Angry%20Bear%20-%20Edit%20Post" the other reason we may not have needed ...>here</a>).</p>
<p>So if we look at the four points, the optimistic version is that the bailout bill will form a &#8220;hedge fund&#8221; for the &#8220;radioactive&#8221; portions of MBSes that no one else is buying. (<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Gross <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2201340/?from=rss">made the same argument at Slate</a> (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/10/links-for-200-1.html">Mark Thoma</a>).)</p>
<p>And we know this will work because hedge funds, as the Wall Street Journal editorial page keeps reminding us, are all doing fine, or at least not getting splashed across the front page of the Wall Street Journal when they fail.</p>
<p>The just appear in the FT and Bloomberg with graphic descriptions of them eating each other <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/10/hedge-funds-preying-on-weak-peers.html">&#8220;because &#8216;investors have been unwinding trades that they otherwise believe make sense&#8217;.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>In the end, as Hilzoy noted, the saving grace of the bailout bill may well be its unfunded mandate that FDIC insurance be increased to $250,000.</p>
<p>The other problem, as even <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/economic-policy.html">Martin Effing Feldstein</a> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122307486906203821.html">notes</a>, is the part of the bill that was sacrificed early: relief for homebuyers:<br />
<blockquote>The financial rescue plan would bring back the confidence needed to revive the financial system only if the Treasury&#8217;s asset purchases could eliminate the current impaired securities now held by the financial institutions, and if the remaining securities could be counted on to remain healthy. The legislation will do neither.</p></blockquote>
<p>But supporting the structures on Main Street itself, as noted <a href="http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/2008/09/bailout-for-beginners.html">here</a>, was sacrificed early:<br />
<blockquote>I think that the&#8230;bit of your crisis just got buried on a big news day. They gave up on support for low-income home owners as part of the negotiations. That was an expensive objective</p></blockquote>
<p>The alternative may well be worse, especially if Goldstein is correct about the fourth part, which strongly implies that Feldstein will be correct about the securities based on those properties.</p>
<p>*It&#8217;s scary when the cynical version of events makes more sense than the official story.  Does anyone really believe that the MBS market will be recovered in two years, when the TARP programme is scheduled to end?  If so, on what evidence?</p>

<blockquote>[I]n addition to the $300k that we already knew was still outstanding on their mortgage&#8230;they had <em>another</em> mortgage on this place. And so the reason they&#8217;ve been inexplicably stalling and quibbling over how much they&#8217;ll pay to do the repairs that are doubtless going to be required by the VA assessor is because, after dropping their price by $168k already, they are in serious danger of actually losing money on this house at this point.</p>
<p>Which of course isn&#8217;t <em>our</em> problem, and if the place isn&#8217;t worth what they need to get to cover their outstanding debt, well, that [isn&#8217;t good] for them. But I admit I had a moment of &#8220;what&#8230;were they thinking taking out a second loan on this house?&#8221; Which really isn&#8217;t in good shape and couldn&#8217;t have been in good shape when they moved away less than a year ago. Did they take out that loan to come up with a down payment on their new place, or did they take it out ages ago and just spend it all?</p>
<p>No idea, really. (And to boot, their realtor says there are health problems in the family.) But regardless, the facts are that if they ought not to have been [engaging in]with second and third mortgages, their lender sure&#8230;ought not to have been approving them.</p>
<p>In any case. I feel sorry for them. But if this house, in the condition it&#8217;s in, isn&#8217;t worth their minimum price (which I suspect we&#8217;re getting very close to finding out), well. My pity isn&#8217;t going to save them. [edited to conform to the Angry Bear Style Manual]</p></blockquote>
<p>Read <a href="http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/2008/10/bailing.html">the whole thing</a>, which explains, indirectly, why it would have been much preferable to just refinance properties at 7% or somesuch than to &#8220;bail out&#8221; highly-leveraged and leveraged securities without any support for the underlying assets.</p>
