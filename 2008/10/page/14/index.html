<blockquote><p>If Social Security Was a Private Corporation Then it Would Sue Tom Brokaw for Every Penny He Has</p>
<p>If a news reporter deliberately makes a false statement claiming that a private company like Boeing or Microsoft is going broke, the company has the right to sue the reporter and the news agency. That is why reporters rarely make statements like Microsoft or Boeing (or Lehman Brothers, AIG, or Goldman Sachs) are going broke.</p>
<p>However, reporters can freely impugn the financial health of a government program like Social Security because a government program cannot sue for libel. That is why Brokaw knew that he could imply that Social Security is going broke, even though it is not true. Social Security cannot sue Brokaw even if he deliberately tells explicit lies about its financial health.</p>
<p>Those who are interesting in learning about the true state of Social Security&#8217;s financial health can find out by looking at the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office&#8217;s website.</p></blockquote>

<p>No guarantee the 11 are on this list, of course.

<p>*I can&#8217;t find any indication on the NBER website what an &#8220;OL&#8221; is; most of the people so desginated have a c.v. that shows them as being or having been a Research Associate only. Also, while some of the Research Associates (RA) were surveyed, no inference that the people listed above are the ones who returned their surveys should necessarily be made.</p>

<ol>
<li>Does anyone believe the market rate for taxi drivers in Maryland is $11.41 an hour?</li>
<li>The base salary for an Assistant Professor of Economics is $115-120K for elite schools (well, Harvard and Stanford, but you get the idea).*</li>
<li>Morgan Stanley offered $85,000 for an Analyst in 2006.  No indication whether it was a bonus-<s>paying</s>eligible position (though presumably the answer would have been &#8220;yes&#8221;).</li>
</ol>
<p>Have fun with the database.  Sure to stun and amaze.</p>
<p>*Columbia offered far less for next year: an Assistant Professor at the Medical Center campus for $90,000 in 2006, an Associate Professor at the main campus for $95,000 in 2007.  But not certain what the specialties are.</p>

<p>That last is WalkAllOverYa, which is either WFC or Big C bound, depending on time of day, phase of the moon, and how obvious John McCain&#8217;s Stage IV melanoma and or TIA attacks are.  I&#8217;m leaving it out of the graphic below because it has dropped too much, even compared to The Big C.</p>

<p>Number of bidders: 71</p></blockquote>
<p>The auction in question was supposed to be <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/tafschedule.htm">a $150B, 85-day auction to get firms through year-end</a>.  (For contrast, the last 84-day [12 week] auction h<a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/monetary/20080909a.htm">ad a bid-to-cover of 1.27</a>.)</p>
<p>Clearly, all the firms that are using the TAF have no capital impediments through the end of the year.  The crisis is over!</p>
<p>So why is the government in the Commercial Paper business?</p>

<p>&#8221;From the perspective of many people, including me, this is another thrift industry growing up around us,&#8221; said Peter Wallison a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. &#8221;If they fail, the government will have to step up and bail them out the way it stepped up and bailed out the thrift industry.&#8221; </p>
<p><a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9c0de7db153ef933a0575ac0a96f958260&#038;sec=&#038;spon=&#038;pagewanted=1">New York Times</a>, 9/30&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..1999.  </p>
<p>Who is Mr. <a href="http://www.aei.org/scholars/scholarID.58,filter.all/scholar.asp">Peter Wallison</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A codirector of AEI’s program on financial markets deregulation, Wallison studies banking, insurance, and Wall Street regulation. As general counsel of the U.S. Treasury department, he had a significant role in the development of the Reagan administration’s proposals for the deregulation of the financial services industry.</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly enough, he produced a paperputting it on the dems for the mess in that they wanted &#8220;regulation&#8221; when the issue was the crap in the portfolio.  He quote Greenspan at a subcommittee hearing in 2005:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;We have found no reasonable basis for that portfolio above very minimum needs.&#8221; He then proposed &#8220;a $100 billion, $200 billion&#8211;whatever the number might turn out to be&#8211;limit on the size of the aggregate portfolios of those institutions&#8211;and the reason I say that is there are certain purposes which I can see in the holding of mortgages which might be helpful in a number of different areas. But $900 billion for Fannie and somewhat less, obviously, for Freddie, I don&#8217;t see the purpose of it.&#8221; Greenspan then articulated his reasons for limiting the GSEs&#8217; portfolios: &#8220;If [Fannie and Freddie] continue to grow, continue to have the low capital that they have, continue to engage in the dynamic hedging of their portfolios, which they need to do for interest rate risk aversion, they potentially create ever-growing potential systemic risk down the road.&#8221; He added, &#8220;Enabling these institutions to increase in size&#8211;and they will, once the crisis, in their judgment, passes&#8211;we are placing the total financial system of the future at a substantial risk.&#8221;[2] </p></blockquote>
<p>And the republicans were the ones, proposing proper regulations, but Fannie went to the dems to stop it:<br />
<blockquote>Thus, in January 2005, three Senators&#8211;Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.), John E. Sununu (R-N.H.), and Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.)&#8211;had introduced tough new legislation to regulate Fannie and Freddie. The legislation was state-of-the-art at the time, and included a carefully developed &#8220;bright line&#8221; test that was intended to end Fannie&#8217;s and Freddie&#8217;s efforts to break out of the secondary mortgage market as their sole allowable field of operations. But the legislation made no mention of limiting the GSEs&#8217; portfolios.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sometime you just don&#8217;t know what to expect from people based on their ideology.  Who knew AEI could understand the Fannie mess to the point of being a profit and yet find that calling for limits to size is not &#8220;regulation&#8221; because regulation is what the dems want.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=American_Enterprise_Institute">American Enterprise Institute</a>:  The American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research (AEI) is an extremely influential, pro-business right-wing think tank founded in 1943 by Lewis H. Brown. It promotes the advancement of free enterprise capitalism[1], and succeeds in placing its people in influential governmental positions. It is the center base for many neo-conservatives. </p>
<p>An example of some of their finer work:<br />
<blockquote>In 1980, the American Enterprise Institute for the sum of $25,000 produced a study in support of the tobacco industry titled, Cost-Benefit Analysis of Regulation: Consumer Products. The study was designed to counteract &#8220;social cost&#8221; arguments against smoking by broadening the social cost issue to include other consumer products such as alcohol and saccharin.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ranking Presidents on Real Economic Growth &#8211; The Definitive List</p>
<p>As we get closer to election time, the level of invective seems to be going up.  What I find interesting is how the intersection between that invective, general ignorance, and outright charlatanism. </p>
<p>For example, mention of FDR is cropping up a lot in some circles, and not in a good way.  You&#8217;d think, the way some bring him up, that FDR was the devil incarnate.  But by the numbers, FDR did one heck of a job.  The Bureau of Economic Analysis has compiled data on real GDP per capita since 1929 (thank you Simon Kuznets), and in that time, no president produced numbers remotely comparable to those put up by FDR. </p>
<p>FDR was president from March 4, 1933 until his death April 12, 1945.  Given his death came before midyear, let&#8217;s look at the growth from 1932, the year before he took office, to 1944, his last full year in office.  Real GDP per capita grew at a scorching, yes, scorching 8.05% a year while he was President.  Now, perhaps you protest…  it was the war.  The war saved the economy.  But the growth rate of real GDP per capita from 1932 to 1940 was a blistering 5.37% a year, or about 2.2 times faster than Ronald Reagan.  Now maybe you say to yourself – well, anyone can growth quickly if he follows the collapse we witnessed from 1929 to 1932. </p>
<p>Which brings us to the President who produced the second fastest growth rate…  LBJ.  LBJ took served from November 22, 1963 until January 20, 1969.  Most of 1963 passed before he took office, so let&#8217;s measure his growth rate from 1963 to 1968, his last full year in office.  That gives us 3.98% &#8211; about 1.6 times Reagan&#8217;s growth rate.  And LBJ did not inherit a Great Depression, like FDR.  Instead, he followed the President who produced the third fastest growth – JFK, under whom real GDP per capita was 2.65%, or about ten percent faster than Reagan managed.</p>
<p>So before we go on, its worth noting… FDR and LBJ probably come in for more criticism from the right for their economic policies than any other presidents precisely because of the one thing they had in common:  these two, by far, expanded government more than other presidents, and not in ways specifically designed to further enrich folks who were already rich.  They gave us the New Deal and the War on Poverty, Social Security and Medicare/Medicaid, the WPA and the Job Corps.  One inherited a Great Depression, one inherited a great economy, one raised taxes, the other cut marginal tax rates, but both expanded the size and scope of government a lot, and both, simply put, produced. </p>
<p>Third, as noted, was JFK.  Anyone think the New Frontier was the work of a small government guy?  That perhaps the Space Program was really one of them laissez faire operations?  (And please don&#8217;t attribute the 1964 tax cuts to Kennedy.  LBJ invoked JFK&#8217;s name to get them passed, but they came after Kennedy died.) </p>
<p>The fourth fastest growth rates came courtesy of Bill Clinton:  a 2.49% annualized increase in real GDP per capita, or about 2% more growth in real GDP per capita per year than Reagan.</p>
<p>Fifth was Reagan, sixth…. Ah heck, let&#8217;s just number them in order to save time:</p>
<p>1.  FDR<br />2.  LBJ<br />3.  JFK<br />4.  Clinton<br />5.  Reagan<br />6.  Carter<br />7.  Nixon<br />8.  Ike<br />10.  GW (that&#8217;s 10 so far – don&#8217;t be surprised if he sinks further into the mire)<br />11.  Ford<br />12.  Bush Sr.<br />13.  Truman<br />14.  Hoover</p>
<p>What the list shows us, is that, the top half of the spots are dominated by Democrats.  Two Republicans, Reagan and Nixon, make it in (5th and 7th, respectively).  It also shows us that the bottom half of the list is populated almost exclusively with Republicans.  The one Democrat in the bottom half of the list, not incidentally, is the Democrat most beloved of Republicans today: Harry Truman.  George Bush has compared himself to Truman, and a few weeks, Sarah Palin told us how she too was comparable to Truman.  What are the odds that prominent Republicans would compare themselves with FDR or LBJ?  (Snarky answer – probably about the same as the odds a Republican administration would produce a growth rate comparable to FDR or LBJ.) </p>
<p>Now, after 70 years of data, after observing what we&#8217;ve observed over all sorts of conditions, it is hard to conclude anything but this:  one party advocates policies that produce rapid economic growth, and one part dismisses those policies with epithets like &#8220;socialism&#8221; and advocates instead policies that produce dismal economic growth.  And dismal economic growth has consequences.  Poor economic growth makes people worse off, and hits them in their pocketbook.  And when people are hurting financially, their health suffers, the rate of divorce goes up, suicides increase, and the abortion rate increases.  So those who advocate the policies that bring us lower incomes, poorer health, break up families, increase suicides, and increase the rate of abortions are doing us all a lot of harm.  More, in fact, than Osama or Saddam could possibly have done.  And yet, the folks who advocates those policies question the patriotism of the rest of us.  Its very, very strange.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>Peter Morici, stellar economist from the University of Maryland, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/reutersComService4/idUSTRE49555K20081006">concludes</a> that the stock market has voted: The bailout will not work. Morici has been one of the few voices that have consistently complained about the U.S. trade deficit. As usual, few economists, except Morici, see the connection between our massive trade deficit and the financial mess. Without fixing the former, there is little hope that addressing the latter will do much of anything for America&#8217;s future.</p>
<blockquote><p>If Obama wants to make Americans better off, he would serve them better by straightening out the banks and taking substantive action on the trade deficit with China. Also, he would be less politically correct on energy and the environment. His platform is full of platitudes and generalizations but not enough substance.</p></blockquote>
<p>But we have handed the trade gun to China, and now it is pointed squarely at our head. Is it any wonder that China now is rolling in the dough? If you don&#8217;t think that was the result of our trade policy, think again.</p>
<p>But we loved our financial institutions; revered the golden boys that hauled in the big bonuses. Manufacturing and production of real goods had no glamour, no pizzazz.</p>
<p>If anyone talked of seriously addressing the issue of trade, they were immediately dismissed as dangerous tariff-mongers&#8211;as if tariffs were the only way to redress the trade problem. Any talk of penalizing our own companies for off-shoring was considered quite unfashionable. Instead, free traders talked about Americans becoming more competitive, as if the U.S. worker could compete with dirt cheap, unprotected labor in third world countries. And, yes, China is a third world country.</p>
<p>Finally, even well-lobbied Congress started to balk at fast-track trade agreements. Lobbyists knew that faster was better. Fleece the sucker before he knows what happened.</p>
<p>Or free traders talked about how better education would solve everything, as if anyone could become a financier, a physicist, or a well-paid economist.</p>
<p>As I have said repeatedly, globalization as it has been structured has been a disaster. The two most poisonous events were NAFTA and China&#8217;s entry into the WTO. Neither included any of the labor or environmental standards its opponents rightly wanted.</p>
<p>That our trade deficit ballooned after these two events is not accidental. With the inflation of that balloon went any hope of America finding a way out of the present dilemma. With the inflation of that balloon, to keep the party going, financial institutions offered credit where credit was not warranted.</p>
<p>Manufacturing and real investment went to China and other emerging countries. America was left with an empty shell in manufacturing and a shameful, deceptive investment strategy we now call the housing bubble.</p>
<p>No one cared. The rich were getting richer and they called the shots. They greased the revolving lobbying door. CEO of Goldman Sachs? Why, you must be a genius&#8211;gads, a billionaire, at least. The Treasury is yours. Interested in keeping inflation down? Why the Fed is yours.</p>
<p>Has anyone in this government or the last spoken honestly about trade? No country can indefinitely continue to buy goods from abroad. America has maxed out its credit card. It has no way to repay the debt. It has nothing to trade. Its great industries went elsewhere. Its captains of industry knew where the bread would be buttered. They fashioned the WTO. Ask IBM&#8217;s Palisano, ask Walmart, ask Dell, ask Intell, ask Delphi, ask any of them: the furniture industry, the pharmaceuticals where they want their labor force.</p>
<p>I have addressed this issue repeatedly: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/what-about-us-investment-abroad.html">here</a>, What about U.S. Investment Abroad; <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/globalization-multinationals-us-wages.html">here</a>, Globalization, Multinationals, U.S. Wages: A Case Study&#8211;to name but a few. Doesn&#8217;t anyone remember when many multinationals were so flush with cash that they were buying back their stock?</p>
<p>Some economists complained that they were not &#8220;sharing&#8221; with the American worker. The truth of the matter was: The American worker had few hands in the production of those goods. Those goods were made abroad; sold here.</p>
<p>Now, all we can worry about is the basket into which we have put all our eggs: The financials.</p>
<p>The American eagle has become a dodo: It can&#8217;t fly. Big, formerly happy, it is now about to become extinct. What idiot put this package together?</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t anyone suspect that no country can continue to borrow&#8211;and, as real cash becomes problematical&#8211;to rely on credit cards and subprime mortgages&#8211; as if money and wealth grew inside banks and on trees?</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t any suspect that trade and production are essential to a nation&#8217;s wealth?</p>
<p>Globalization was precariously disjointed&#8211;one massively populated poor third world country more than eager to become the world&#8217;s manufacturer and export platform and another country, rich and resting on its laurels, all too eager to tell its population that houses were great ATM cards. The former gathered in the wealth, sharing it with foreign investers and foreign firms; the latter was gulled into thinking that spending was their perogative, along with saving the world in the name of freedom and democracy.</p>
<p>When manufactured moved elsewhere, Americans were told to get better, higher paying jobs. Banks flooded the populace with credit cards. Bankruptcy laws were fashioned to protect the credit card companies and banks.</p>
<p>And were banks afraid of being over-leveraged? Hell, no. And you thought bankers were smart.</p>
<p>When 911 occurred, our beloved President told Americans to shop at the mall&#8230;as if spending was the answered. As average wages failed to keep up with inflation and as jobs fled to emerging nations, we looked only at those doing well at the top of the heap. The stock market was doing well. What more could one ask for?</p>
<p>Needless to say, I am one unhappy dodo.</p>

<p>The old world order is not just slipping away; it is running out the door. Or, to change the metaphor, the structures of the old order are falling so fast that is difficult to keep track of the debris on the streets.</p>
<p>While the CEO of Lehmann Brothers, that &#8220;gorilla of greed,&#8221; Dick Fuld, has a small point when he says that the crisis is not <i>just</i> a crisis of Wall Street, he certainly has been part of the capitalistic gang that has driven the U.S. over the cliff, dragging many other countries with it.</p>
<p>Yes, the fashioners of globalization have done a hell of a job, Brownie. The rich got really rich, but they simply could not keep the party going indefinitely, these great scions of capitalism. Today&#8217;s offerings that spell out parts of the crises are from here and India. Both are worth reading in their entirety.</p>
<p><a href="http://inhome.rediff.com/money/2008/oct/06bcrisis1.htm">M R Venkatesh</a> spells out how China could wreck the U.S. economy, as if it needed more help, simply by selling some of their U.S. dollar denominated holdings.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>the recent bailout package being approved in the US Congress needs to be viewed in the context of the spurt in the accumulation of forex reserves of China by about $500 billion in the last six months to about $2 trillion in aggregate. </p>
<p>Why is China engaged in this exercise? What could be its implications on the on going global financial crisis? Could China trip the bailout package announced by the US last week? Crucially what are the implications for the existing global order?</p>
<p>What is intriguing in the Chinese forex reserve build-up is that both trade surplus and foreign direct investment account only for a part of this gargantuan pile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Be nice to China.</p>
<p>William M Tab in <a href="http://www.monthlyreview.org/081006tabb.php">The Monthly Review</a> sees Four Crises of the Contemporary World Capitalist System:<br />
<blockquote>the financial crisis, the loss of relative power by the United States, the rise of other centers of accumulation, and resource depletion and ecological crisis.</p>
<p>The Washington Consensus has been discredited, and although the damage it causes continues, it has not achieved Washington’s goals. There has been a uniting of much of the world into a coalition of the unwilling. If serious left-wing governments took power in many countries of the South, there could be dramatic reconstruction of the global political economy.</p>
<p>During the Bush presidency, the United States lost one in five manufacturing jobs and that too is part of financialization and globalization. Wages have been pushed down, pension benefits curtailed, health care burdens shifted onto workers and their families, employees made to work part-time or fired and hired back as “temporary” workers, and so on—all in order to meet profit targets and to finance the huge debts companies are burdened with as a result of widespread borrowing to finance takeovers. More people are working part-time or as temporary workers and are pessimistic about the prospects of their children. They see their government captured by the corporations and the wealthy.</p>
<p>We are now witnessing the loss of what Charles DeGaulle once called the “exorbitant privilege” of the United States, derived from its role as issuer of the international currency. George Soros, speaking to the World Economic Forum in January of 2008, suggested, “It’s basically the end of a sixty-year period of continuing credit expansion based on the dollar as the reserve currency.”11 The advantage the United States has enjoyed by being able to borrow in its own currency has been undercut by abuse, outsized current account deficits, and the buildup of dollars in foreign hands. This has progressed to the point where the money creation and lower U.S. interest rates implemented by the Federal Reserve to stave off financial collapse have driven down the currency’s value and encouraged further flight from the dollar.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is one other piece I thought I might include, but it does require extensive comment: <a href="http://www2.blogger.com/%3CA%20href=">The Financial Development Report</a> (January 2008) from the World Economic Forum. Suffice it to say that its conclusions were:<br />
<blockquote>On the basis of this holistic view, this year the United States scores top honors in the rankings closely followed by the United Kingdom.The collective strength of financial intermediaries and markets in these countries, spanning banks, investment banks, insurance companies, equity markets, and bond markets is unparalleled.</p></blockquote>
<p>The circle has been squared at last. I do understand that placing just its conclusions before you is a bit unfair, but I am feeling particularly nasty today. Parts of the report are truly superb; others are just latrine filler.</p>
