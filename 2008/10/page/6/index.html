<p>Tom puts an end to the &#8220;oh, they were just mistakes&#8221; tax argument:<br />
<blockquote>The thing about [Sarah Palin taking her spouse and especially her kids with her on business trips]&#8230;is that the attempt to edit the terms of the trips after the fact could be seen as evidence of intent to commit of federal income tax fraud—the tax-law bloggers are in agreement that the Palins&#8217; tax returns incorrectly treated those reimbursements, which generally have to be treated as taxable income, and a question is whether the error was an innocent mistake—and/or defraud the Alaskan taxpayer more directly.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this case, it really <strong><em>is</em></strong> the cover-up that Reveals Preferences.</p>

<p>Reading Between the Lines of an Excuse</p>
<p><a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1008/14805.html">Here&#8217;s a story</a> you probably already heard.<br />
<blockquote>The Republican National Committee has spent more than $150,000 to clothe and accessorize vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin and her family since her surprise pick by John McCain in late August.</p>
<p>According to financial disclosure records, the accessorizing began in early September and included bills from Saks Fifth Avenue in St. Louis and New York for a combined $49,425.74.</p>
<p>The records also document a couple of big-time shopping trips to Neiman Marcus in Minneapolis, including one $75,062.63 spree in early September.</p>
<p>The RNC also spent $4,716.49 on hair and makeup through September after reporting no such costs in August.</p>
<p>The cash expenditures immediately raised questions among campaign finance experts about their legality under the Federal Election Commission&#8217;s long-standing advisory opinions on using campaign cash to purchase items for personal use.</p></blockquote>
<p> <bold>&#8230;</bold><br />
<blockquote>But hours after the story was posted on Politico&#8217;s website and legal issues were raised, the campaign issued a new statement:<br />&#8220;With all of the important issues facing the country right now, it&#8217;s remarkable that we&#8217;re spending time talking about pantsuits and blouses. It was always the intent that the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign,&#8221; said McCain-Palin spokesperson Tracey Schmitt.</p></blockquote>
<p>The campaign&#8217;s position is that Palin couldn&#8217;t dress herself appropriately for the high profile position of someone campaigning to be VP, so they shelled out some dough.  That makes sense, having &#8220;the clothing go to a charitable purpose after the campaign&#8221; doesn&#8217;t.  It raises three possibilities about the McCain camp&#8217;s views:</p>
<p>1.  If Palin becomes VP, she won&#8217;t be appearing in public so she won&#8217;t need the nice threads any more</p>
<p>2.  At the time of these purchases, the McCain campaign felt that McCain had no chance of taking office, which meant Palin wouldn&#8217;t become VP, and thus could go back to  dressing herself at her (or Alaska&#8217;s) expense again.</p>
<p>3.  She&#8217;ll be needing nice outfits once she&#8217;s VP, and she&#8217;ll be getting all new ones.</p>
<p>I have a hard time believing the McCain campaign considered either options 1 or 2.  Which leaves 3.  Which leaves the need for a whole new wardrobe.  Which has to be paid for by someone.  I wonder who the McCain campaign believes is going to pay to replace those outfits&#8230;<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />by cactus</p>
<p>Rdan here:  And to think I was going to put this chart up today.  (hat tip for our friend noni mausa).  I hope Nieman&#8217;s provided more than three or four dresses&#8230;a purse can run over $500. However, perhaps the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/bonuses-are-10-of-bailout.html">economic problems today have not extended to a segment of our citizens</a>.  </p>

<p> Here for your consideration is a private company made up of defense contractors running city governments in the state of Georgia, USA.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dOI9yrKGAV4"><br />Privatized Cities</a><br />
<blockquote> — When the government of the city of Sandy Springs in Georgia decided to bring in a multinational corporation to run all of the city’s services &#8211; with the exception of police and firefighting &#8211; it effectively became the first fully privatized city in the world.<br />It’s a trend that is already spreading fast, with four new cities launched in the last three years, all of them run by the same company, defense contractors CH2M Hill. ”</p></blockquote>
<p>(<a href="http://www.ch2m.com/corporate/">CH2MHill</a> is the company that bought out oil services company Veco, the company of Bill Allen who plead guilty to bribing Alaska Legislators, and was the star prosecution witness at the Ted Stevens investigation.)</p>

<p>This &#8216;graf in particular caught my eye, since it is Subtil as a Flying Mallet:<br />
<blockquote>I was in this game for the money. The low hanging fruit, i.e. idiots whose parents paid for prep school, Yale, and then the Harvard MBA, was there for the taking. These people who were (often) truly not worthy of the education they received (or supposedly received) rose to the top of companies such as AIG, Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and all levels of our government.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Lahde appears to be betting that <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/">this man&#8217;s</a> father won&#8217;t hold a grudge.  That has never been true before.</p>
<p>(Spelling of Mr. Lahde&#8217;s name corrected 31 Dec due to correct rendering in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/12/aig-in-wapo-ii.html">this post</a>.)</p>

<blockquote><p>Potability, Politics, and Pipes<br />By <a href="http://aguanomics.com/">David Zetland</a><br />A Guest Post  (<a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/09/the-economics-of-clean-water-a-guest-post/">Freakonomics</a>)</p>
<p>In 2000, the United Nations declared an intention to reach eight Millennium Development Goals (MDG’s) — each with one or more targets — by 2015. The MDG’s are attracting a lot of money, but money can’t fix everything.</p>
<p>Since I’m a water guy, I’ll explain how money may not work by looking at Target 3 of MDG 7:</p>
<p>Halve the proportion of the population without sustainable access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.</p>
<p>Let’s begin with some baseline figures: According to the U.N., 78 percent of the world’s population had access to improved drinking water sources in 1990. As of 2004 (most recent data), that share was 83 percent. (For sanitation, the figures are 49 percent in 1990 and 59 percent in 2004, but let’s ignore this sub-target for now. Let’s also ignore the 1990 baseline for a program that began in 2000.)</p>
<p>But wait, did you notice the discrepancy? The goal being measured and pursued (improved drinking water sources) is not the originally proclaimed goal (sustainable access to safe drinking water). This discrepancy is no accident. Rather, it reflects the difference between the ambitions of development activists (safe and sustainable) and the realities of development bureaucrats.</p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the post with a sequel is interesting at how we &#8220;solve&#8221; problems through a narrow lens.</p>

<p>Economic Catastrophes – Another Look at Economic Performance by Presidential Party</p>
<p>Since we&#8217;re in a period of economic crisis, I started thinking about crises of the past.  Its not always easy to define whether a moment in time is more than just part of ups and downs in a run-of-the-mill business cycle or is a genuine crisis, but in general, a situation in which the lives of most Americans are changed for the (much) worse, and there is a wide-ranging threat that some event will sweep away some integral part of the American way of life probably qualifies. </p>
<p>With that loose definition in mind, off the top of my head, here&#8217;s what I come up with as a list of American economic crises beginning with the Big One – or at least, the Big One from the last century:</p>
<p>1.  The Great Depression<br />2.  The 1970s<br />3.  The S&#038;L Crisis<br />4.  The Current Mess</p>
<p>Not too many, but then we should all be grateful that a crisis is not a common thing.  For what its worth, I did a quick search online and Wikipedia has a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis">list of financial crises since 1980</a> and the only American ones on their list are numbers 3 and 4 on mine.</p>
<p>The Great Depression started with the Crash of 1929 – in Hoover&#8217;s first year.  Hoover was the third Republican President in a row following Harding and Coolidge, so the Crash occurred after eight consecutive years of Republican control of the White House.</p>
<p>The 1970s are usually blamed on Jimmeh Carter, but he only took office in 1977, long after the mess started.  From inflation to the oil crisis, I can&#8217;t think of any part of the mess that was the 70s that actually began during the Carter administration other than the Village People.  Even the Bee Gees started long before Carter arrived on the scene.  If there was a defining &#8220;economic moment&#8221; in the 1970s, it was the collapse of the Bretton Woods System (i.e., the Gold Standard) in 1973. </p>
<p>The S&#038;L Crisis is harder to date precisely.  The big events <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis">according to Wikipedia</a> were the collapse of Home Savings, Lincoln Savings (of Keating Five fame), and Silverado Savings and Loan (of Neil Bush fame).  Regardless of how its sliced, the crisis occurred several years into the Reagan administration, and continued well into the succeeding Bush administration.</p>
<p>The current mess dates to late 2007 or 2008 – again, there isn&#8217;t a precise event.  But clearly, it began after a number of years of Republican control of the White House.  Of course, events don&#8217;t happen in isolation.  The economy is path dependent, and some of the factors that helped cause these event happened as much as decades earlier.  As an obvious example – the fixed exchange rate built into the Bretton Woods system was an accident waiting to happen, and it caused periodic problems which were dealt with by whoever happened to be in office at the time.  Nixon, however, was the only one to decide on price and wage controls and closing the gold window, much less shutting down the system altogether.  If you believe the system should have been abandoned (as do I) – it could have been done in a smoother and more orderly process, one that didn&#8217;t cause the same degree of harm to the US and world economies.  If you feel, on the other hand, that the Bretton Woods system should have been saved, its pretty clear that while he was trying to do it, the effect on the US economy could only be described as damaging. </p>
<p>So… why is it that we&#8217;ve seen more of these, er, catastrophic events under Republican Presidents than under Democratic Presidents?  To pre-empt one of the usual responses, note that each of the crises happened at least four years into Republican control of the White House.  Four or eight years into Republican rule should be more than enough time to undo any damage inherited from Democrats.  To pre-empt another, sure I started with the Great Depression, but I could easily have gone back to the Panic of 1907.  And to pre-empt a dumb comment that comes up all the time:  if you&#8217;re going to insist that FDR prolonged the Great Depression, please be sure to explain why the Depression lasted longer in countries that adopted a more laissez-faire approach than in countries that followed a more New Deal type approach.  I&#8217;m not Amity Shlaes, thank you very much.</p>
<p>So the options are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  I&#8217;ve been quite selective in picking only economic disasters that occurred under Republican administrations and ignoring those that occurred Democratic administrations, or otherwise misrepresenting the timing.  (I often get accused of the latter misrepresentation, particularly when I insist that the tax cuts of 1964 occurred after JFK died rather than at the start of his term, so I&#8217;m particularly sensitive to that one.) </p>
<p>2.  There are roughly an equal number of &#8220;potential&#8221; economic disasters under Democratic presidents than under Republican presidents, but under Democratic presidents we manage to dodge the bullet.</p>
<p>3.  The are a lot more potential economic disasters under Republicans than under Democrats, and under Republican presidents we&#8217;ve managed to avoid most of them, while Democrats go untested.</p>
<p>4.  We&#8217;re no more likely to get stuck with an economic mess under Reps than under Dems and vice versa, and its all just random chance.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m obviously the wrong person to comment on option 1 – if I&#8217;m <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/01/in-my-opinion-thomas-sowell-is-hack.html">Sowellizing</a> I wouldn&#8217;t admit to it, would I?  So I&#8217;ll let you as the reader decide on that one.</p>
<p>I also think most reasonable, and even a few of the folks at the National Review are unlikely to seriously argue that a preponderance of economic disasters under Republican administrations is a clear sign that Republicans have better economic policies. </p>
<p>Which leaves option 4 – its all random chance v. 2, we&#8217;re dodging bullets under Dem administrations that we aren&#8217;t dodging under Rep administrations.  Interestingly enough, we seem to spend more time in run of the mill recessions under Republican administrations too, so we&#8217;re not just randomly hitting the big disasters when Republicans are in office – we&#8217;re hitting the small ones too. </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s look put some percentages on this.  Assuming that there are four economic disasters to be distributed amongst the 13 administrations, and assuming that spacing considerations preclude two consecutive administrations from both being the starting point of an economic mess, by my count, there are 204 ways in which the starting point of an economic mess could be distributed among those 13 administrations.  Of those 204 combinations, 16 of them, or about 7.8%, involve only Republican administrations.  (This result and others below in this <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILg2v5DNb03wQQ">Google spreadsheet</a>.)  The four disasters we had spent a lot of effort trying to land on a relative small target-space, didn&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>How about looking at growth rates?  Since 1929, the first year for which data is available, the growth rate of real GDP per capita under Republican Presidents was 0.68% a year.  Under Dems, 3.84%.   Excel provides us with a cool little function called &#8220;ttest&#8221; – essentially, it runs a two sample t-test to see if two series come from the same underlying distribution.  (To the numbers jockeys in the audience – I ran the least restrictive version of the test, which does not assume that the variance of the two samples is the same.)  The probability that the Democrats and Republicans essentially behave the same is 0.45%.  (Again, results are in this <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILg2v5DNb03wQQ">Google spreadsheet</a>.)</p>
<p>One common defense of the right is that maybe growth is faster under Dems, but that&#8217;s only because they leave behind a mess for Republicans to clean up.  So rerunning the above test, leaving out the first year in which party in the White House changes, we find that the Republican growth rate is 0.58%, and the Democratic growth rate is 4.17%.  The probability that the two parties produce the same growth rate falls to 0.34%.  So there really is something to the &#8220;cleaning up the mess&#8221; argument, just not what its proponents claim.  (Once more, results are in this <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILg2v5DNb03wQQ">Google spreadsheet</a>.  OK – I&#8217;m gonna stop repeating this now.)</p>
<p>A better critique would be that the world is different now than it was in the pre- and early post-WW2 era.  So if we start in 1953, the first year of the Ike administration which came after the Depression, after WW2, after Korea, we get an average yearly increase in real GDP per capita of 1.6% under Reps, and 2.83% under Dems, and only a 2.6% probability that the two groups turned in an equivalent performance.  Leaving out the first year again exacerbates the difference.  (Results in the spreadsheet.)</p>
<p>So…  there is a difference between the economic performance of the two parties.  (And because I don&#8217;t have the time to once more go through a litany of the likely reasons, here <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/comparing-presidents-comparing-parties_16.html">here are a few</a>.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">Here is another.</a>  And here&#8217;s one more, straight from a variety of headlines on a variety of topics we&#8217;ve seen since GW took office: those who profess that government has no useful role in the economy tend to run government poorly, especially in those situations when they realize that something has gone wrong and the only thing left to do is use the government to &#8220;do something.&#8221;)</p>

                                <p>The leadership at Wells Fargo must be royally peeved <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/21/business/21plan.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print">at this point</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Stable national players like Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Wells Fargo are already digesting acquisitions. A second group of so-called super-regional banks are well positioned to take over their competitors, officials said, but have been reluctant to undertake or unable to complete deals.</p>
<p>By offering capital at a favorable rate, the government may encourage them to expand. In this category, industry analysts point to regional leaders, like KeyCorp of Cleveland; Fifth Third Bancorp of Cincinnati; BB&#038;T of Winston-Salem, N.C.; and SunTrust Banks of Atlanta.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, to be polite about it, one of those last four is (imnvho) a strong contender for Worst-Run U.S. Bank <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/10/20/sports/Sports-Economy-Naming-Rights.php">That Didn&#8217;t Pay $400MM for Naming Rights</a> (h/t <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/">Skip Sauer</a>).  Ignoring that, a quick glance at the list shows at least two—BB&#038;T and most especially SunTrust—that would have made Wells Fargo a very happy camper in its Southern Strategy effort.</p>
<p>So now, having spent the money, beating Citi and saving the FDIC, Wells is going to have to watch as SunTrust eats its lunch before it has even sat down for appetizers.</p>
<p>This is a bad move by the Fed that will result in no new lending, a lot of window-dressing, and bigger bank failures during the second term of the &#8220;failed Obama administration.&#8221;  (Video of Dave Barry appearance at the National Press Club, 12 November 1992, does not seem to be available on the Internet.  C-Span??  C-SPAN???)</p>
<p>If anyone wants to understand &#8220;moral hazard,&#8221; just imagine being a WFC shareholder* who watched your bank do due diligence and is about to watch SunTrust snap up some weak-kneed competitor by filling out a two-page form and sending it to Hank Paulson.</p>
<p>Anyone who says that Paulson (1) knows what he is doing, (2) does not use the word &#8220;kleptocracy&#8221; in describing Paulson&#8217;s actions, and (3) thinks it is a Good Idea is lying or selling something.</p>

<p>If you caught my guest appearance on Saturday Night Live this weekend, you may have seen an ad or two (or twenty) from Senator Obama&#8217;s campaign.</p>
<p>This barrage of advertising is adding up to the most expensive negative ad buy in political history. And these ads are funded with the nearly $200 million the Obama campaign and the DNC raised in September.</p>
<p>With this new money, they&#8217;ll only step up their media buying efforts to flood every network with ads attacking our shared values. These ads are full of inaccurate information designed to mislead voters in key media markets&#8230;.</p>
<p>And if you can give $75 or more today, we&#8217;ll send you an exclusive McCain-Palin Victory 2008 lapel pin to show your support during the final days of the campaign. We appreciate your support.[emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Personally, I would have preferred the $25 tire-pressure checker.  But just so we know our money would be going to waste:<br />
<blockquote>Because the McCain-Palin Campaign is participating in the presidential public funding system, it may not receive contributions for any candidate&#8217;s election. However, federal law allows the McCain-Palin Campaign&#8217;s Compliance Fund to defray legal and accounting compliance costs and preserve the Campaign&#8217;s public grant for media, mail, phones, and get-out-the-vote programs. Contributions to McCain-Palin Victory 2008 will go to the Compliance Fund, and to participating party committees for Victory 2008 programs. </p></blockquote>
<p>Surely, no one actually authorized that e-mail to be sent out.  Must be the Nigerian Prince who is dating Anne Hathaway. (SNL link not found.)</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>The New York Times today had two top-left front-page stories. The first &#8220;China Plans to Boost Growth as Economy Slows&#8221; outlines China&#8217;s use of export tax rebates as a response to slowing world demand. (Now, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/21/business/worldbusiness/21yuan.html?partner=rssnyt&#038;emc=rss">here</a>. )</p>
<p>The second, which replaced the first later in the morning, is Bernanke&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">call</a> for stimulus package for our ailing economy, propping up the ailing consumer.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;If Congress proceeds with a fiscal package, it should consider including measures to help improve access to credit by consumers, homebuyers, businesses and other borrowers,&#8221; Mr. Bernanke said. &#8220;Such actions <i>might</i> be particularly effective at promoting economic growth and job creation.&#8221; [Italics mine.]</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Private sector employers shed 168,000 jobs in September and a total of 900,000 jobs since January. Real consumer spending, adjusted for inflation, declined during the summer and appears to have declined yet again in September.</p></blockquote>
<p>The two stories could not be more appropriately juxtaposed. As I pointed out in an earlier piece, &#8220;Manufacturing, the Recovery, and What Lies Ahead,&#8221; China uses economic policy&#8211;such as export tax rebates, currency manipulation&#8211;to protect its export platform.</p>
<p>The U.S. response to weakening global conditions will be a large stimulus package to improve credit access. I would say that consumer spending is the real target.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>As I noted, the slowing in spending and activity spans most major sectors. Real personal consumption expenditures for goods and services declined over the summer and apparently fell further in September. Although the weakness in household spending has been widespread, the drop-off in purchases of motor vehicles recently has been particularly sharp. Increased difficulty in obtaining auto loans appears to have contributed to the decline in auto sales</p></blockquote>
<p>Bernanke&#8217;s comment that the U.S. trade was doing well, I found curious:</p>
<blockquote><p>International trade provided considerable support for the U.S. economy over the first half of the year. Domestic output was buoyed by strong foreign demand for a wide range of U.S. exports, including agricultural products, capital goods, and industrial supplies. Although trade should continue to be a positive factor for the U.S. economy, its contribution to U.S. growth is likely to be less dramatic as global growth slows. </p></blockquote>
<p>Bernanke nicely slide around the problem of trade. From July to August, the overall trade deficit is down $2.1 billion.</p>
<p>But a closer inspection shows that exports are down $ 3.4; imports are down $5.5 billion.</p>
<p>The decline in imports can be attributed to both the economy and to the price of oil. The larger decline in the exports can be attributed to economic conditions elsewhere. How one argues depends, I suppose, how one weights various factors and how one sees the causal chain. A weakening economy is driving down the price of oil.</p>
<p>However you look at it, exports are not growing.</p>
<p>For China, the problem is not a recession or worse, it is a matter of maintaining its export position. China understands trade; the U.S. understands the consumer.</p>
<blockquote><p>Industrial production and construction slackened from July through September because of weak exports, a slumping real estate market and temporary restrictions imposed during the Olympics, the National Bureau of Statistics announced on Monday.</p></blockquote>
<p>As one tool its economic arsenal, the State Council of China</p>
<blockquote><p>announced that it would increase export tax rebates for everything from labor-intensive products like garments and textile to high-value products like mechanical and electrical products</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Increased export tax rebates will make Chinese exports even more competitive in the United States and Europe, particularly as China has intervened heavily in currency markets to halt any further appreciation of China’s currency since mid-June. <i>But with the United States heavily dependent on China to buy the Treasury bonds needed to finance a bailout of the American financial system, the Bush administration has stopped criticizing China’s trade and currency policies.</i> [Italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>For Bernanke, the primary problem is to maintain credit flow&#8211;and restore consumer confidence and spending.</p>
<p>As I said, the juxtaposition of the two articles is appropriate.</p>

                                <p>The WSJ wants to pretend that Barack Obama is responsible for <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122445840565148489.html?mod=djemEditorialPage">Canada making a good decision</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Prime Minister Stephen Harper and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France signed an agreement Friday to begin negotiations for a free trade pact between Canada and the European Union. A Canada-EU study released last week outlines the joint economic benefits of such a partnership, with two-way trade estimated to increase 22.9% by 2014.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess the WSJ is more impressed with Barry O&#8217;s G-D-like powers than I am.  Or maybe they <a href="http://www40.statcan.ca/l01/cst01/gblec02a.htm">just can&#8217;t read data</a>:</p>
<p>Exports to the United States:<br />2002  347,051.8<br />2003  328,983.3<br />2004  350,576.3<br />2005  368,414.7<br />2006  361,440.4<br />2007  356,094.2</p>
<p>Imports from the United States:<br />2002    255,232.5<br />2003  240,356.3<br />2004  250,038.3<br />2005  259,348.2<br />2006  265,023.0<br />2007  269,752.5</p>
<p>Imports steadily rising, exports falling for the last three years (and basically flat to 2004), with 2008 probably not being great and 2009-2010 already looking dicey.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a great move for Canada, but any delusion that it is Obama-, not data-driven should be confined to the WSJ editorial page.</p>
