                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>In a reply to a recent piece by <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/forum/">Michael Mandelbaum</a> on the Council on Foreign Relations website, I posted the following comment (which is still awaiting moderation):<br />
<blockquote>How globalization has been structured is the issue.</p>
<p>In this case, with one debtor nation (the U.S.) depending primarily on its financial wizardry to carry it forward, while hollowing out its manufacturing center; and emerging nations taking up the slack in production of goods and services–all resulting in enormous disequilibria: trade/debt.</p>
<p>To keep the Western consumer buying and not producing has created fertile ground for the kind of disaster we are witnessing.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest that those who praise globalization regardless of how it is structure look more carefully at its crafting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mandelbaurm makes two points worthy of addressing:
<ol>
<li>Where some form of globalization exists, &#8220;there is no alternative.&#8221;</li>
<li>The opponents of globalization will exploit &#8220;the most potent of all modern political ideas — nationalism&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Nationalism for Mandelbaum includes, I am sure, the raising of tariff barriers. So far, that has not happened, nor will it happen, I suspect.</p>
<p>In short, he makes no connection between the current crisis and globalization. Once the current crises is over, everyone can go back to business as usual. Frankly, there will be no &#8220;business as usual.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addressing this point, I would like to examine IBM as a case study: its approach to offshoring and its recent quarterly report. IBM is doing <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/technology/companies/09blue.html">well</a>, with &#8220;ample cash flow from its operations and $9.8 billion in the corporate treasury.&#8221; Third-quarter net income is up 22% with an expected 22% increase over 2007.</p>
<p>On first glance, it would seem that Mandelbaum is correct: There is no connection. Once the liquidity crisis is addressed, there will be business as usual. To understand how this may not be, in the long run, we should look at how IBM has positioned itself globally.</p>
<p>Like many multinationals, for the past four or five years has pursued an active and energetic policy of off shoring. While this has enabled it to weather the current storm for the short run&#8211;building up that sizable $9.8 billion corporate warchest&#8211;, it has done so at the expense of providing the American worker with the means to meet growing debt and growing cost of living and of providing America an economic engine to reconsitute itself once the financial crisis is settle.</p>
<p>And just how enegetic has off shoring been for the likes of IBM and other multinationals?</p>
<p>In 2003, IBM began moving 4,700 programming jobs overseas. Managers were instructed to move jobs to China, India, and elsewhere where technical talent was high and labor costs were low. In IT, IBM was but a tip of the iceberg. Other IT firms were following suit: Hewlitt Packard, Intel, Apple, to name but a few.</p>
<p>In 2003, IDC <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3289131">foresaw </a>&#8220;a quadrupling to $46 billion by 2007, or 23 percent, of total tech spending. India, China and Russia stand to gain the most from the IT spending trend. Forrester Research projected that nearly 1 million U.S. IT jobs will move abroad in the next 15 years &#8212; a forecast that greatly troubled union organizers and politicians with IT firms in their districts.</p>
<p>In 2006 and again in 2007, an IBM shareholders placed the following proposal on the stockholder meeting:</p>
<blockquote><p>The stockholders request that the Board establish an independent committee to prepare a report evaluating the risk of damage to the Company’s brand name and reputation in the United States resulting from IBM’s offshoring initiative and make copies of the report available to shareholders of the Company upon request.</p></blockquote>
<p>Both times, the IBM Board of Directors recommended a &#8220;No&#8221; vote on the proposal. Both times the proposal was defeated.</p>
<p>In 2003, the full scope of <a href="http://www.allianceibm.org/articles/execoffshoremeet.htm">IBM&#8217;s plans</a> for off shoring were laid bare. I strongly recommend readers to use this link; for the rest, here are some snippets. Tom Lynch, Director of Global Employee Relations, made the following remarks:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>[When]we saw trade barriers come down through things like NAFTA, we moved from the US to other countries a whole lot of manufacturing and from generally high-cost labor areas to lower cost labor areas. In the1990s that focus was primarily in the are of manufacturing.</p>
<p>&#8230;from now until the year 2010 and beyond; we&#8217;re looking at an emerging trend now to move services offshore, in addition to manufacturing operations, some functions that would be included in those services would be engineering, Harry mentioned software development, certainly chip development as well. Services like accounting and financial services.</p>
<p>US workers or workers in a country where the work is being relocated from, will, in many cases, be asked to train their replacements.</p>
<p>If we&#8217;re moving work to China, the Chinese management team and maybe some Chinese workers will have to come to affect the transfer of knowledge needed to do that. That&#8217;s going to raise a lot of tensions as you&#8217;re training someone to do a job that you know is no longer going to be yours at the end of some fixed period of time.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, by 2003, the advantages of NAFTA had begun to wane.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now Mexico doesn&#8217;t look as cheap as, you know, some other labor markets, as well. So it&#8217;s a real dynamic marketplace out there. Each of you, I would urge, work with your folks to see what makes the most sense in terms of your own businesses and your own needs. But clearly the dominant countries that are being talked about are India, China, and generally speaking, Eastern Europe.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tom realized that governments might complain.<br />
<blockquote>Government reaction? It is hard for me to imagine any country just sitting back and letting jobs go offshore without raising some level of concern and investigation, and I think we&#8217;re going to see some of that in the countries where jobs are moving from.<br />It&#8217;s hard to fight globalization. Governments, I think are going to find it is fairly limited as to what they can do so unionizing becomes an attractive option. And for a lot of reasons, there are indications that union organizing is going to become more aggressive over the coming months.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, with NAFTA and the WTO strongly behind this kind of globalization, the cat was out of the bag, so speak. At this point, government or union intervention may be futile.</p>
<p>Tom put the matter succinctly when he said:<br />
<blockquote><i>I think that we&#8217;re at the stage, frankly, where for many of our managers, the answer is &#8220;offshoring—what is the question?&#8221;</i> So we&#8217;re really, the approach and the strategy here really has to crystallize as we decide what it is that is going to be moved, and what are the implications of doing so.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>In this fashion was globalization structured.</i> To say the least, the structuring of globalization, despite all its hoopla, was designed to benefit a select few. Corporations did not consider anything other than cheap labor. No, they did not think of the poor Chinese or the poor Russians. That kind of argument was window dressing for economists: How the world would be united through trade and poverty abolished.</p>
<p>How then do we make the leap to the current crisis? First, enormous wealth flowed out of the U.S. and into the private coffers of our multinationals. That flow was directly responsible for the obscene bonuses and incomes that CEO&#8217;s earned, of which we now complain. That flow placed ever-greater strains on actual financial resources within the U.S. To compensate for stagnant wages, credit in every form&#8211;however leveraged or ill-designed&#8211;was extended. America had become a debtor nation of staggering proportions. As debt increased, so too did the trade deficit. Financial institutions, which already had made significant monies investing overseas, attempted to keep the party going at home through questionable lending practics.</p>
<p>But America already was in decline; the flow of jobs to third world emerging economies already was taking its toll on America. The flow of jobs sent unimaginable wealth, not only to corporate CEOs, corporate coffers, and to third world managers who oversaw third world labor but also to the coffers of third world governments, such as China The preponderance of that wealth did not go to lowly employees.</p>
<p>As long as labor was kept cheap, the game was on. In short, the disparity of wealth between those at the top and those at the bottom increased globally, here as well as in China and elsewhere.</p>
<p>What ruled the day? Managerial talent at the top that could exploit every niche <i>in the structure of globalization.</i></p>
<p>And what happens when finally the credit game is over, when this finely honed corporate machine exhausts the consumer, when it has bankrupted us all? (By the &#8220;corporate machine&#8221; I mean not only producers of products and services to support those products but financial corporations as well.)</p>
<p>I have said it repeatedly, and I will say it again: How globalization was structured provided fertile ground for the present collapse. More care should have been taken. Instead the floodgates were completely and suddenly opened. Instead of a trickle that we all might handle, we were greeted with a torrential flood, from which there is now no escape.</p>
<p>Let me return to widen one Mandelbaum quotation, giving you its full context:<br />
<blockquote>(World War II demonstrated that while manufacturing weapons can increase productive economic activity, actually using them has the opposite effect.) As Mrs. Thatcher might put it, where some form of globalization is concerned there is no alternative.</p></blockquote>
<p>In Mandlebaum&#8217;s view, any economic activity connected with globalization is worthwhile, as long as it increases &#8220;productive economic activity,&#8221; even if that activity is manufacturing weapons.</p>
<p>Globalization however it is structured is a primary good, a good that transcends any questions of detail. This is the mantra we have endlessly heard.</p>
<p>To which I say: the HOW is everything. The race is not to the swiftest but to he who most carefully plans. Globalization is important. But avoiding sudden dislocations in wealth, trade, debt, and credit must be major considerations.</p>
<p>Maybe we will learn better the next time.</p>

<p>Hat tip K Harris for this link to <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95395712">National Public Radio</a> and this thought as well regarding Tom&#8217;s post below:</p>
<blockquote><p>The issue at hand is that Treasury resisted the notion of equity in return for aid all the way along, and now is putting out the word that equity in return for aid is among the favored notions. Over the weekend, word was that lobbyists were toiling away to prevent the equity element from being used, but now the NYT characterizes equity for aid as among the favored notions on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The NYT is being used to announce a change in attitude toward this provision of the law. Treasury and banks are coming to realize that the strongest form of aid &#8211; new capital &#8211; is what is needed, since a very large dose of a lesser form of aid failed to work.</p>
<p>By the way, I gave youse guys a link on this on Sunday night. &#8220;This American Life&#8221; covered CDOs, CDSs, and equity infusion, and did a pretty good job. The point was that the authority was in the bill, but that banks were working hard to keep that authority from being used. That has now changed. That is why the NYT is being used to make this aspect of the bill better known. Treasury is about to use the equity authority. </p>
<p>By the way, the NYT keeps using the word &#8220;banks&#8221; but whatcha wanna bet an insurance firm or two gets some fresh equity?<br />k harris |     | Email | 10.09.08 &#8211; 11:31 am | #</p></blockquote>

<p>Here&#8217;s a funny thing about reporting on the bank-recapitalization approach to the TARP.  This is (almost) the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/business/economy/09econ.html">NYT lede</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Treasury officials say the just-passed $700 billion bailout bill gives them the authority to inject cash directly into banks that request it. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/meltdown_paulson;_ylt=Atrx4cj9QpvnXV..agAA4.ms0NUE">AP hears the same</a> on explicit condition of anonymity:<br />
<blockquote>An administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because no decision has been made, said the $700 billion rescue package passed by Congress last week allows the Treasury Department to inject fresh capital into financial institutions and get ownership shares in return.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now I suppose any law is theoretically open to interpretation, but this is a little ridiculous.  The more-or-less plain text of the law is that the main limitation is that whatever the Treasury does has to involve a Troubled Asset transaction.  Here&#8217;s section 113(d) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008:<br />
<blockquote>       (d) Conditions on Purchase Authority for Warrants and Debt Instruments-</p>
<p>        (1) IN GENERAL- The Secretary may not purchase, or make any commitment to purchase, any troubled asset under the authority of this Act, unless the Secretary receives from the financial institution from which such assets are to be purchased&#8211;</p>
<p>              (A) in the case of a financial institution, the securities of which are traded on a national securities exchange, a warrant giving the right to the Secretary to receive nonvoting common stock or preferred stock in such financial institution, or voting stock with respect to which, the Secretary agrees not to exercise voting power, as the Secretary determines appropriate; or</p>
<p>              (B) in the case of any financial institution other than one described in subparagraph (A), a warrant for common or preferred stock, or a senior debt instrument from such financial institution, as described in paragraph (2)(C).</p>
<p>        (2) TERMS AND CONDITIONS- The terms and conditions of any warrant or senior debt instrument required under paragraph (1) shall meet the following requirements:</p>
<p>              (A) PURPOSES- Such terms and conditions shall, at a minimum, be designed&#8211;</p>
<p>                    (i) to provide for reasonable participation by the Secretary, for the benefit of taxpayers, in equity appreciation in the case of a warrant or other equity security, or a reasonable interest rate premium, in the case of a debt instrument; and</p>
<p>                    (ii) to provide additional protection for the taxpayer against losses from sale of assets by the Secretary under this Act and the administrative expenses of the TARP.</p>
<p>              (B) AUTHORITY TO SELL, EXERCISE, OR SURRENDER- The Secretary may sell, exercise, or surrender a warrant or any senior debt instrument received under this subsection, based on the conditions established under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p>              (C) CONVERSION- The warrant shall provide that if, after the warrant is received by the Secretary under this subsection, the financial institution that issued the warrant is no longer listed or traded on a national securities exchange or securities association, as described in paragraph (1)(A), such warrants shall convert to senior debt, or contain appropriate protections for the Secretary to ensure that the Treasury is appropriately compensated for the value of the warrant, in an amount determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p>              (D) PROTECTIONS- Any warrant representing securities to be received by the Secretary under this subsection shall contain anti-dilution provisions of the type employed in capital market transactions, as determined by the Secretary. Such provisions shall protect the value of the securities from market transactions such as stock splits, stock distributions, dividends, and other distributions, mergers, and other forms of reorganization or recapitalization.</p>
<p>              (E) EXERCISE PRICE- The exercise price for any warrant issued pursuant to this subsection shall be set by the Secretary, in the interest of the taxpayers.</p>
<p>              (F) SUFFICIENCY- The financial institution shall guarantee to the Secretary that it has authorized shares of nonvoting stock available to fulfill its obligations under this subsection. Should the financial institution not have sufficient authorized shares, including preferred shares that may carry dividend rights equal to a multiple number of common shares, the Secretary may, to the extent necessary, accept a senior debt note in an amount, and on such terms as will compensate the Secretary with equivalent value, in the event that a sufficient shareholder vote to authorize the necessary additional shares cannot be obtained.</p></blockquote>
<p>The law actually requires a contingent equity grant to accompany any TARP asset purchase; it just leaves every salient detail up to the Secretary of the Treasury.  So to the question of whether the Secretary can structure TARP purchases as preferred equity injections, the reasonably plain answer from the text of the law is, sure.  (See also <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/09/doing-the-right-thing/">Krugman</a>, who links Roubini with some backstory.)</p>
<p>This brings us back to a point I made in passing about the<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/solidary-pt-2.html"> blank-check version</a> of the plan: the discretion can be used for good or for ill, and the outcome depends in part on whether Henry Paulson can escape the <a href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2003/02/and-another-hit-and-run-i-find-myself.html">Davies Conjecture</a> and thus doesn&#8217;t end up figuring prominently in Lessons From the Great Depression 2 (by <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=squLnSDrJ4EC&#038;dq=peter+temin+lessons+from+the+great+depression&#038;pg=PP1&#038;ots=3Sq6PZBdXj&#038;sig=Ev-tjerzClfc6hE-xqH-EYgmLWU&#038;hl=en&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;resnum=4&#038;ct=result">Peter Temin</a>&#8216;s great-grandchild).  A la Dodd, the contingent equity arrangements were left much less to the Secretary&#8217;s discretion.  Interestingly, if you want to recapitalize the banks via TARP, it looks like the current form of the law offers somewhat more options for doing so.  Along those lines, if the House Republicans really wanted to forestall nationalization of the banking system, they failed miserably as giving the Secretary discretion not to take a meaningful equity stake is not the same as preventing the Secretary from doing so.</p>
<p>Added: With a h/t to DOLB in the comments, here&#8217;s the definition of &#8216;troubled assets&#8217;:<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<ul>  (9) TROUBLED ASSETS- The term `troubled assets&#8217; means&#8211;</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul> (A) residential or commercial mortgages and any securities, obligations, or other instruments that are based on or related to such mortgages, that in each case was originated or issued on or before March 14, 2008, the purchase of which the Secretary determines promotes financial market stability; and</ul>
</ul>
</ul>
<ul>
<ul>
<ul> (B) any other financial instrument that the Secretary, after consultation with the Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, determines the purchase of which is necessary to promote financial market stability, but only upon transmittal of such determination, in writing, to the appropriate committees of Congress.</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/10/cant-anybody-pl.html">Brad DeLong blogs</a> the train wreck at a clown show that is the McCain campaign so I don&#8217;t have to (big report due in a week, sorry ).  He has a twofer.</p>
<p>First, there&#8217;s the the McCain health plan.  Or, rather, the evolution from</p>
<p>We&#8217;re phoning it in, to</p>
<p>OMG, people are <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/mccains-health-plan-tax-cut-or-tax-hike.html">looking at it and figuring out ways it might suck</a>, so</p>
<p>Sweeten it, but&#8230;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s too expensive for our small-government-conservative narrative, and voila,</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s commit political suicide!!<br />
<blockquote>You know, we have llike seen this before. On health care:</p>
<ul>
<li>McCain started with a tax credit that was equal in aggregate to the additional tax he levied on employer-sponsored health benefits in the first year&#8211;in later years the credit became much smaller than the tax.</li>
<li>Then it was like ooops, that&#8217;s not popular. We know&#8211;we never intended to subject employer-sponsored benefits to the FICA tax, only to the income tax.</li>
<li>Then it was like ooops, now we&#8217;re scared that the plan is fiscally irresponsible and will raise the deficit. We know&#8211;we will cut Medicare!</li>
<li>Then it was like ooops, we have to carry Floria. We know&#8211;have Sarah Palin say that McCain will not cut but will protect your entitlements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Can&#8217;t anybody play this game? If we lose the election to these clowns, I am going to be really embarrassed. It seems as though nothing is competently staffed out&#8211;as if nobody in the McCain campaign cares about actually having policy proposals, but only about having something incoherent that an ignorant and lazy reporter can be deceived into thinking is a policy proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Second, on the housing crisis, McCain pulls his new bailout plan out of his behind at the &#8220;debate.&#8221;  However:<br />
<blockquote>But it soon develops that much of Senator McCain&#8217;s proposal is not his but Barney Frank&#8217;s, and that the differences make it not a homeowner relief bill but an imprudent banker profit and rescue bill.</p></blockquote>
<p>And so our so-called conservatives want to nationalize negative home equity (that&#8217;s some concern for the taxpayer, there):<br />
<blockquote>[DeLong quoting the Politco] “Clearly we face the trade off that we would in fact be taking the negative equity position and putting it on the taxpayers books instead of putting it on the private lenders books or the homeowners books,” Holtz-Eakin told Politico. “We think the balance of risk has shifted to the point where this is the way to go.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Does the McCain website say that?  No.<br />
<blockquote>But by the time I got to the website, it read differently:</p>
<blockquote><p>JohnMcCain.com &#8211; McCain-Palin 2008: For those that cannot make payments, mortgages must be re-structured to put losses on the books and put homeowners in manageable mortgages. <s>Lenders in these cases must recognize the loss that they’ve already suffered.</s> [Apparently that last sentence was struck by a panicked editor &#8212; ATB.]</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently the schmuck who was assigned the job of writing up the web description did not believe the plan could possibly be what he was told it was.</p></blockquote>
<p>Most deliciously, someone couldn&#8217;t stop from thinking out loud in naming the &#8220;program,&#8221; such as it is: it&#8217;s the &#8220;American Homeownership Resurgence Plan (McCain Resurgence Plan).&#8221;  Apparently it&#8217;s change someone can believe in.</p>

<p>To over-price lower skilled labor or to under-price higher skilled labor &#8212; is that the question?</p>
<p>Santa Fe’s minimum wage raise to $8.50/hr (now $9.50/hr, soon indexed) lost lower skilled workers a significant number of jobs (8.3%, adjusted for something – nominal employment rose) many to higher skilled replacements, according to a think tank committed to protecting the working poor from higher wages.</p>
<p>Could such pay/employment trade-offs lie in the future as America catches up wages with productivity growth?</p>
<p>Simple (ask any minimum wage earner) job/wage resolution:<br />1) If lower skilled workers lose a percentage of jobs to a higher minimum wage (or any broadband wage increase), they should earn more over a lifetime because they will earn more when they are working ($3.35/hr more in 2005 Santa Fe!) – which should be most of the time.<br />2) Higher skilled workers would be earning enough extra to pay a bit more in taxes to fund some cover for the lower skilled if needed.<br />******<br />Quick lopsided income tutorial:<br />At $186,000/yr, the average family income reported by the Census for top 20 percentile families may sound out of proportion – your typical primary care provider earning well below that these days – but it is about what we should expect if family income growth matched per capita income growth reported by the same Census: doubled since 1968, when $95,000/yr was the top 20 average.</p>
<p>What is out of proportion is the Census reporting 100% per capita income growth along with 67% (overall) family income growth since 1968 – a 33% family shortfall? The presumed missing 33% &#8212; presumably hidden by the Census practice of “top coding” income over $1 million per family out of its survey &#8212; would add $111,000 to the top quintile average – presuming family income grew exactly the same pace as per capita income since 1968.</p>
<p>Family income may have grown closer to 90% over those years: still leaving $85,000 hidden by the top code (not $111,000): still making for 185% top quintile growth (not 212%), still comparing lopsidedly to the 12%, 22%, 37% and 53% eked out by lower quintiles (much due to more members working more hours). If we add enough dollars to lower quintile 2007 incomes to bring them into line with 90% growth: the four lower additions total up to the lopsided dollop of top income, dollar for dollar (by mathematical definition).</p>
<p>If we could somehow throw a reset switch to share around 2007’s doubled personal income according to 1973&#8217;s distribution, lower four quintile wage earners would remain in the same relative (skill/pay) bargaining positions vis-à-vis each other in the job market – making for little expectation of more unemployment &#8212; ditto for shaved-income top earners: my “Chinese snake dance” theory of labor price and employment. 🙂<br />******<br />It is not under-priced labor &#8212; in the sense of people here and overseas willing to work for less &#8212; that is dragging down American wages and causing whole-segment unemployment (see very many American born cab drivers or fast food workers lately?). It is the under-pricing of labor that is causing America&#8217;s Great Wage Depression (my term covering both lost pay and lost jobs).</p>
<p>If Australia had a 1000 mile land border with China – open, Mexican-American style – Australian labor would need powerful wage support legislation to maintain its native pay and employment at maximum levels: a solid minimum wage (1/2 the “real” average wage &#8212; USA &#8220;real&#8221; meaning $25/hr; reported AWI up only 20% since 1968) plus the most up to date collective bargaining structure known as sector-wide labor agreements (not the card check attempt to wring one more drop of life out of dead law &#8212; Australian could actually consider sector wide now that its once effective if eccentric wage support structure has badly eroded).</p>
<p>America&#8217;s is the only modern OECD labor market facing the double whammy of globalization and yearly immigrating millions; and yet remains the only modern OECD market seriously devoid of legislative defenses against either outside low wage expectations or against the home grown race to the bottom (recently introducing whole-segment unemployment to middle class, would-have-been supermarket employees).<br />_____________</p>

<p>The Flat Tax Revolution &#8211; A Brief Second Visit</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that long ago that folks on the right were crowing about how flat tax fever was sweeping much of Europe and producing monster economic growth.  (Examples abound &#8211; enter the words &#8220;flat tax revolution Europe&#8221; and you find about 200,000 hits, most of them from about 2005 to 2007.)  These were the same folks who had told us in 2001 about the rapid growth that cutting taxes was going to produce in the US.</p>
<p>So whatever happened?</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/10/nobel-odds.html">Mankiw</a>, who notes that &#8220;among economists listed&#8221; at <a href="http://www.pinnaclesports.com/lines.aspx?type=contestcategory&#038;contesttype1=nobel+prize&#038;contesttype2=2008+nobel+prize+in+economics">PinnacleSports</a>, Martin Feldstein is the favorite.</p>
<p>I was going to snark that that must be because they have a lousy field for bettors, but Mankiw links to <a href="http://www.ladbrokes.com/lbr_sports?action=go_generic_link&#038;level=TYPE&#038;key=210003529&#038;disp_sort_id=28&#038;category=&#038;subtypes=">Ladbrokes</a>, too, where people rationally expect that declaring Economics once and for all irrelevant (i.e., giving the award to Fama and/or French [UPDATE: Tyler Cowen <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/10/what-ever-happe.html">disagrees</a>.) is The Way to Bet.</p>
<p>Comparing the two lists, there is only one possible conclusion: PinnacleSports has a lousy field for bettors.</p>
<p>Sadly, neither has EconoSpeak favorite <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/09/possible-economics-nobels.html">William Easterlin</a> on the list, while my pick*—<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/econ/dept/vitae/baumol.htm">William Baumol</a>—rates as ones of the longest betting shots at Ladbrokes.</p>
<p>*I&#8217;ve been wrong every year, so selling Baumol at 40:1 is probably a better bet than Phillies over Dodgers or Red Sox over Tampa Bay.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2008/10/why-pay-interes.html">William Polley</a> has a note on paying interest with links to Altig, DeLong, and others:<br />
<blockquote><a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2008/10/why-is-the-fed.html">David Altig</a> takes up the question with links back to <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/10/why-is-the-fed.html">Marginal Revolution</a>, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/the-liqudity-tr.html">DeLong</a>, as well as <a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/archives/2008/10/fed-to-start-pa.html">my post</a> from yesterday.  (Thanks, David!)</p>
<p>Rather than looking at it as what DeLong calls &#8220;Operation Twist&#8221;, Altig opts for the simpler explanation that it will put a lower bound on the effective fed funds rate.  That is, of course, the fundamental effect that this would have in any circumstance&#8211;crisis or not.  It puts the Fed in as the residual buyer of the funds and thus establishes the floor.</p>
<p>The apparent lack of a (non-zero) lower bound on the funds rate was first noticed over a year ago when there were trades happening at zero percent.  Here&#8217;s what I said in August 2007:</p>
<p>So while I don&#8217;t have a full and definitive explanation [for the zero percent transactions], it would seem that borrower risk is a factor, and the fact that these are excess reserves (which earn no interest) is also a factor. In that case, the low end of the range could stay low until the reserve picture gets back to normal.</p>
<p>When the Fed began discussing it more seriously in May 2008, I said:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go on the record that this is a good idea. It will help to smooth out the recent fluctuations in the funds rate that garnered so much consternation at this blog among other places. It would prevent interest rate policy from getting in the way of policies for directly injecting liquidity into the financial markets by effectively keeping a floor on the funds rate even during a big injection of liquidity.</p>
<p>So I am clearly on board with the stated reasoning behind the move.  Plus, I think it&#8217;s just a good policy to eliminate what is effectively a tax on reserves.</p>
<p>But I was struck by DeLong&#8217;s comment about open market operations on the risk premium rather than on the liquidity premium.  The more this drags on and the more we learn, the more I am coming to the conclusion (see here, for example) that this is a problem with the risk premium.  Why else would the CP market freeze up despite the massive injections of liquidity, not to mention the CDS market?  There seems to be a lot of liquidity out there, but it&#8217;s not necessarily getting to where it needs to go.</p>
<p>And that got me wondering if paying interest on reserves might, as Tabarrok suggested, accomplish the goal of getting that liquidity where it needs to go in an Operation Twist sort of way.  While the Fed is not yet targeting particular assets, we&#8217;re treading very close to the kind of environment where that might be necessary.  (Have you seen a T-bill rate lately?)  Having the ability to pay interest on reserves would not be counter to that purpose, even if it wasn&#8217;t the primary reason.  Of course, it should also be noted that the paying of interest on reserves is a permanent change rather than a temporary one meant only for the crisis.</p>
<p>Paying interest on reserves is a good policy for a lot of reasons.  The obvious ones and the ones that might still be a stretch&#8211;at least for now.</p></blockquote>
