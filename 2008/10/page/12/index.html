<p>From the <a href="http://toledoblade.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081010/COLUMNIST13/810109970/-1/NEWS08">Toledo Blade</a>:<br />
<blockquote>   It was an overlooked bombshell in breaking news cycles preoccupied with financial crisis, rescue plans, presidential politics, and a vice-presidential debate.</p>
<p>    But what the Justice Department&#8217;s exhaustive investigation and blistering report concluded about the enormous damage done to the department through improper politicization is far more troubling than even Sarah Palin in disjointed attack mode.</p>
<p>    Investigators from both the department&#8217;s Office of Inspector General and Office of Professional Responsibility found that political pressure did indeed drive the dismissal action against at least three of the nine federal prosecutors abruptly fired. At the time, then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales insisted the individuals were all dismissed for inadequate performance, or failure to implement the President&#8217;s law enforcement agenda.</p>
<p>    But it appears the longtime pal and adviser to President Bush was lying through his teeth. Turns out the real reason some of the top federal lawyers were removed from the job, according to the Justice Department report, was that either the U.S. attorneys had the audacity to prosecute Republicans or because they failed to aggressively prosecute Democrats.</p>
<p>    Either way, their behavior ticked off well-connected GOP politicians who had come to expect a politically loyal Justice Department. A couple of calls from powerful New Mexico Republican officeholders helped push former U.S. attorney David Iglesias out of a job. Evidently, the top New Mexico prosecutor was remiss in his duty to produce criminal charges against Democrats in the run-up to the 2006 election.</p>
<p>    Another U.S. attorney in Missouri lost his post over a petty complaint from Republican Sen. Christopher Bond, and still another was bumped to make room for a protÈgÈ of White House political adviser Karl Rove. There was a pervading culture of partisanship/loyalty-above-all-else in the department, recalled one of the fired attorneys.</p>
<p>    ìNot only were my colleagues and I not insulated from politics &#8211; as we should have been in our jobs as prosecutors &#8211; but we were fired for the most partisan reasons,î Mr. Iglesias said.</p>
<p>    But it mattered not to the Machiavellian Bush Administration that justice was compromised with appalling political interference. It operates under the premise that the ends always justify the means.</p>
<p>    Look at the pattern.</p>
<p>    The administration used fear about nonexistent WMDs as a means to justify the ends of invading Iraq. It outed a CIA operative to punish critics, eliminated civil rights under the misnamed Patriot Act to expand executive authority, crafted energy policy with energy companies to benefit the energy industry, and allowed the subprime mortgage mess to perpetuate to generate obscene wealth for a few.</p>
<p>    And now there are official findings of fact about the politically charged dismissals of U.S. attorneys conducted to satisfy a White House agenda. Scandal-weary Americans may be inclined to dismiss yet another administration disgrace, but what happened at the Justice Department is too big a deal to ignore.</p>
<p>    We&#8217;re supposed to be a country that requires ìequal justice under the law,î not tainted justice under political consideration. But that&#8217;s what we had under shameless administration zealots like Mr. Rove and Mr. Gonzalez.</p>
<p>    The former administration officials allowed the most invaluable assets of the Justice Department &#8211; its integrity and independence &#8211; to be jeopardized for political ends. They permitted wholesale politicization of the department, as one commentary put it, ìby subjecting new hires and sitting U.S. attorneys to rigid ideological litmus tests.î</p>
<p>    Even though new Attorney General Michael Mukasey has appointed a federal prosecutor to investigate whether criminal laws were violated all the way to the Oval Office, the administration may luck out again. As time runs out on its lamentable tenure, the injustice it perpetrated on a once-venerated institution may go unpunished.</p>
<p>    But before the next administration takes over, Americans need firm assurance that the rule of law will be applied fairly by the Justice Department. Never again can there be partisan allegiance required of incoming professionals, or political criteria that outweigh the legal and ethical.</p>
<p>    The impartial administration of justice in this nation, its very credibility, was nearly destroyed by the tyrannical ambitions of a few.</p>
<p>    How&#8217;s that for big news almost buried?</p></blockquote>

<p>had a post entitled <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/how-did-lehman-manage-that.html">&#8220;How did Lehman manage That?&#8221;</a> asking how Lehman&#8217;s debt could sell for about ten cents on the dollar.  A commenter told me I was confused and that Lehman&#8217;s accountants would have warned investors if there was anything, along the line of the things I imagined, lurking in their detailed balance sheet. I claim that the argument must be that Lehman debt couldn&#8217;t possible sell for 10 cents on the dollar as anything which can cut the value of assets by ten or increase the value of debts by ten (or one down root ten and one up root ten or whatever) would have been flagged.  That is Lehman didn&#8217;t do that. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_10_05_archive.html#4384967636976944653">Lehman managed that.</a></p>
<p>There was something lurking somewhere in their assets and their liabilities.  I have no idea if it was self CD insurance (my fantasy).  Whatever it was any competent and honest accountant should have flagged it.  Now I don&#8217;t blame any particular accounting firm (which you note as remained nameless) because I think that financial innovation has made responsible accounting impossible.  No one is competent to audit the books of modern financial operators.</p>

<p>Gary Lammert&#8217;s prediction of a great crash may have been off by two plus years. Nonetheless, this economic fractalist, kept telling us to &#8220;expect the unexpected.&#8221;</p>
<p>While he spoke of vast fractals about to culminate in one great macroeconomic implosion and while his fractals seemed strangely divorced from anything I could understand, when he departed from fractal-mania, he was absolutely on target regarding the problem: Debt, debt, debt.</p>
<p>Here is his<a href="http://weblog.ecommunics.org/theeconomicfractalist/index.html#318"> latest</a>:<br />
<blockquote>This nonlinear transformation will correspond to and represent a sudden implosion of the money supply. It will correspond to the timing of a credit collapse of debt that cannot be repaid, cannot be rolled over, cannot be remedied by further federal government debt, and will correspond to the realization that state governmental services that can not be maintained in the face of collapsing property values and property taxes and in the face of a rapidly collapsing private sector of the real economy. 9/22-23/22-23 is the daily fractal decay sequence that will rapidly introduce a realization that the Word&#8217;s greatest macroeconomic depression has arrived. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Debt that cannot be repaid, cannot be rolled over, cannot be remedied by further federal government debt&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I admire a good writer&#8211;and Gary&#8217;s baroque, yet balanced phrasing, is always a delight. I must confess that I am partial to those who handle the language with exquisite precision&#8211;a mark of a fine mind, I always thought.</p>
<p>Whatever you think about fractals or whatever you think about Gary&#8217;s making predictions two years too early, you should look carefully at his substance; forget the fractal-mania. Here is <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/09/chart_of_the_we_1.html">Gary</a> <i>three</i> years ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>The underperformance of the premiere summation American Index, the Wilshire 5000(TMWX), reflects the disproportionally negative integrative burden on the US macroeconomy of its valuation fractal determining elements &#8211; total quantitative personal, governmental, and corporate debt, the latter of which has become much more expensive to service under some behemoth&#8217;s new junk bond status; unpayable private pension funds soon to assumed by American taxpayers- of formerly great, soon to be bankrupt, US corporations; expensive war cost which have historically withered every prior major overextended world power, record lack of US collective personal savings used as a base for fractional lending, exhausted consumer discretionary spending running up against near record energy costs; outsourced high paying jobs and current wages not maintaining pace with inflation and debt servicing; siren enticing and predatory unregulated lending practices leading to asset consumption by a new group of extremely marginal buyers; rising short term interest rates; the cresting of valuations of the US ATM &#8211; equivalent asset, i.e., housing overvaluation; and recent massive forward consumption of corporate profitless US automobiles akin to a python eating its semiannual one time big pig bolus meal.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would be the first to say that his fractals need a lot of work if they are going to be really predictive. But what economist is ever predictive? Only God could write an equation accurately predicting economic events. Strip out the fractals.</p>
<p>In one mighty baroque sentence, each item in the series hanging delicately and clearly after the last and each appositive carefully crafted, he manages to collect almost all the issues that have now bubbled to the surface. Perhaps the very exercise of doing fractal economics gave him insight, however murky.</p>
<p>In December, 2005, he <a href="http://www.economicfractalist.com/">warned</a> that a crash might be coming:<br />
<blockquote>Macroeconomic turning points are not caused by changes in mass psychology. Rather mass psychology is a dependent variable that is causally changed by the transitioning major economic conditions that exist and characterize the asymptotic saturation level and the money creation peak area of the cyclical complex debt-money-asset macroeconomic system. It is at this peak transition saturation and inflection area that the collective ongoing wages of the masses of earners can no longer support additional debt load to acquire overvalued and overproduced assets. It is at this point that retrenchment and devaluation occurs. It is here where fractal growth levels off or reaches a zenith point &#8230;.and thereafter decays usually with an incipient nonlinear deflationary crash&#8230;.. Mass psychology then follows the macroeconomic mechanistic debt liquidation &#8211; asset deflation optimal fractal decay evolution.</p></blockquote>
<p>On April 21, 2006, he issued his first of what were to be the first many warning: &#8220;More Than Ever&#8230; Expect The,,,, Very Unexpected &#8230;. The Unbalanced Global Macroeconomy &#8230;&#8230; And The US Long Term Debt Market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gary nailed the problem, put it up there for everyone to see.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many suspected that Gary saw fractals as causative, not merely descriptive.</p>
<p>Commentators laughed at his warnings, scorned his fractals, and finally left him to work alone and undisturbed. Put a comment up on his website and you will get no reply. (He did change websites.)</p>
<p>Although he framed the picture perfectly, I think finally he himself had to question whether even fractals could be perfectly predictive. (Off by a couple of years&#8230;oops.) In truth, I am not sure what he privately thinks about the fractal science he relentlessly pursues.</p>
<p>If publicly he had omitted the fractals&#8211;kept them on his working bench, using them only as his private tools&#8211;and then offered more conventional rationales of why the big picture he saw was so dangerous, he might have done better.</p>
<p>Instead, he pushed the core argument back to fractals, a mistake, I think. In trying to prove a mathematical point, he failed to deliver his message. Sometimes I suspect he sees the world as one giant mechanism, rolling along fractally-governed, predetermined lines. While this may be true, that vast fractal has to be beyond comprehension.</p>
<p>Be all this as it may. I find him to be one of the most fascinating and most interesting minds on the Internet.</p>
<p>Too many of us sound like each other. Gary stands brilliantly apart. Unlike many of our leaders, I am sure recent events have not surprised him.</p>

<p>From my inbox this morning, Nouriel Roubini says, &#8220;<a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/roubini-monitor/253973/the_world_is_at_severe_risk_of_a_global_systemic_financial_meltdown_and_a_severe_global_depression">The world is at severe risk of a global systemic financial meltdown and a severe global depression</a>.&#8221;  (Tell me something I don&#8217;t know.)  Go and read the whole article, but here&#8217;s Roubini&#8217;s plan for immediate action.  Is this &#8216;listen to the guy who&#8217;s basically been right all along&#8217; time?<br />
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Another rapid round of policy rate cuts of the order of at least 150 basis points on average globally;</li>
<li>    a temporary blanket guarantee of all deposits while a triage between insolvent financial institutions that need to be shut down and distressed but solvent institutions that need to be partially nationalized with injections of public capital is made;</li>
<li>    a rapid reduction of the debt burden of insolvent households preceded by a temporary freeze on all foreclosures;</li>
<li>    massive and unlimited provision of liquidity to solvent financial institutions;</li>
<li>    public provision of credit to the solvent parts of the corporate sector to avoid a short-term debt refinancing crisis for solvent but illiquid corporations and small businesses;</li>
<li>    a massive direct government fiscal stimulus packages that includes public works, infrastructure spending, unemployment benefits, tax rebates to lower income households and provision of grants to strapped and crunched state and local government;</li>
<li>    a rapid resolution of the banking problems via triage, public recapitalization of financial institutions and reduction of the debt burden of distressed households and borrowers;</li>
<li>    an agreement between lender and creditor countries running current account surpluses and borrowing, and debtor countries running current account deficits to maintain an orderly financing of deficits and a recycling of the surpluses of creditors to avoid a disorderly adjustment of such imbalances.</li>
</ul>

Moreover,<br />the previous recession caused by the tech boom was also a result of a<br />failure to save. The US economy (and others) have discouraged savings,<br />which has resulted in an overinvestment in high risk ventures (such as<br />asset price bubbles).</p>
<p>Had savings rates been higher from the early 1990s onwards, both the<br />tech boom and bust and the subprime bubble and current crisis would have<br />been averted.</p>
<p>The best way to reward the market for saving is to have higher interest<br />rates. Ensuring that real interest rates remain positive at all times<br />and using monetary policy to ensure absolute price stability (neither<br />inflation nor deflation over the course of the business cycle) is the<br />best solution in my opinion.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />Quotes:<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />America&#8217;s (and the world&#8217;s) economy created this crisis because<br />something within the system created the conditions that led to this<br />disaster. This is important to realise because, when the time comes to<br />stop reacting to daily crises and start examining why the failure<br />occurred, there will arise a series of solutions that will help prevent<br />a similar event occurring again.</p>
<p>It is not as though market capitalism has failed &#8211; as far as I am<br />concerned market capitalism fails all the time. Abandoning capitalism<br />for, say, Communism is about as judicious a decision as eating pebbles<br />to cure an infection that has developed a resistance to antibiotics.</p>
<p>Put simply, the current crisis was caused by people with lots of money<br />who invested it in the wrong thing. The people thought they were doing<br />the right thing because the numbers looked right, the ratings agencies<br />gave AAA ratings, the majority of respectable financial analysts said is<br />was the best thing to do and the Joneses next door were making a killing<br />from it. Herd behaviour? Yes. But herd behaviour that had careful<br />planning behind it.</p>
<p>The structural problem resulted in the market investing unwisely.<br />Investments were made in particular areas (shares, property) that seemed<br />wise at the time but ended up going bad. While we may expect high return<br />investments to be highly risky, the same could not be said for low<br />return investments &#8211; which are now in free-fall too.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />Cash ought to be the safest form of investment. There has to be some<br />sort of low or zero risk investment that people can make. It&#8217;s not wrong<br />to invest in shares or property &#8211; it&#8217;s just important that a percentage<br />of surplus cash remain in cash form.</p>
<p>Having money tied up in cash is not very sexy. The interest you gain on<br />it is nowhere near as potentially rewarding as a higher risk investment.<br />Yet the issue is not whether cash investments replace other investments<br />&#8211; but having a healthy mix of the two.</p>
<p>Cash investments are meant to be safe. They are not meant to reduce in<br />value. If you have $10,000 sitting in a cash management trust you are<br />not meant to watch it drop down to $9000. Any cash you have sitting in<br />an account that remains uninvested in anything else should, at the very<br />least, have the same value when you withdraw it as when you deposited it.</p>
<p>And cash &#8211; savings &#8211; is useful as a &#8220;safety net&#8221; when things go wrong.<br />Everyone knows the importance of having more cash flow available than<br />what you need normally because of the danger of unforeseen events. The<br />best place to access this cash flow is from interest-bearing accounts<br />that you have saved up over time (rather than, say, maxing out your<br />credit card).</p>
<p>Yet here is where the structural problems come in: Americans (and many<br />others) did not invest their cash surplus in savings but put them into<br />risky investments that have since lost money. This was not a moral<br />failure, but a practice that the entire economy encouraged.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />Had (positive real interest rates and absolute price stability) been the<br />Fed&#8217;s policies from the early 1990s onwards, there would not have been<br />either the tech boom and bust nor the subprime mortgage crisis and<br />today&#8217;s credit crunch. GDP growth during this period would have been<br />lower, certainly, but considering the potential cliff that GDP is likely<br />to plummet in the present, this would have been a better outcome.<br />Moreover, savings rates would have been high and credit market debt<br />would have been more sustainable.</p>
<p>I honestly don&#8217;t know what is going to happen to the world economy over<br />the next day, month or even year. What I do know is that, once a<br />recovery is underway, new policies and paradigms will need to be<br />explored to prevent this financial horror story from occurring again.<br />Increasing household savings is one major step in this direction &#8211; and<br />this is best handled by using interest rates to affect broad market<br />behaviour rather than creating legislation to force people to save.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>

<blockquote><p>Not only have individual financial institutions become less vulnerable to shocks from underlying risk factors, but also the financial system as a whole has become more resilient.” — Alan Greenspan<br />Multimedia</p>
<p> Punit Paranjpe/Reuters<br />A LINGERING GLOBAL INFLUENCE An interview with Alan Greenspan, nicknamed the Oracle, was shown live outside the Bombay Stock Exchange last month.</p>
<p>George Soros, the prominent financier, avoids using the financial contracts known as derivatives “because we don’t really understand how they work.” Felix G. Rohatyn, the investment banker who saved New York from financial catastrophe in the 1970s, described derivatives as potential “hydrogen bombs.”</p>
<p>And Warren E. Buffett presciently observed five years ago that derivatives were “financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.”</p></blockquote>

<p>What isn&#8217;t going on in financial markets ?  </p>
<p>There are various theories of the financial crisis which suggest simple solutions and have the only defect that they are fantasies.</p>
<p>1) The only problem is mark to market accounting.</p>
<p>Market prices for mortgage backed securities (MBS) are very low because of a panic.  Banks are required to list assets on their balance sheet at market prices.  Banks appear to have negative equity (debt greater than assets) because of this silly rule.  This caused the crisis.</p>
<p>This seems to be the theory of a weird left right alliance including Rep Darrel Issa (R Calif.).  It is based on the idea that ideologue Congress persons can price assets better than professionals.  The assets include MBS but also debt and shares of banks.  This is fairly clearly a wish fulfillment fantasy.  The idea is that if we resolutely say everything is fine, everything will be fine.</p>
<p>2) The problem is adverse selection in the MBS market and mark to market accounting.</p>
<p>Here there is a theory better than &#8220;I know best&#8221; for why MBS market prices are below the average hold to maturity value of MBSs.  MBSs are worth less than was thought a year ago, but some of them are worse than others.  For one thing, the value depends on the standards of the initiator of the under<bold>lying</bold> mortgage e.g. are they liars&#8217; loans or normal loans.  Owners of such MBSs know more about them than potential buyers.  Therefore, the stuff that is for sale is the most toxic of the toxic securities.  Therefore the market price is the price for the worst of the worst of MBSs.  Therefore it would be irrational to sell anything which is only semi toxic.  There is a separating equilibrium with low volume of trade and very low prices.  Applying such prices to all MBSs understates their value.  </p>
<p>Now without irrationality this shouldn&#8217;t matter.  People who know that the stuff for sale is the worst of the worst should also know that the other stuff is better no ?  Here market participants are required to be sophisticated when they buy and sell MBSs and unsophisticated when they read balance sheets.</p>
<p>3) The problem is mark to market, adverse selection and capital controls.  </p>
<p>Ah now a regulation which is definitely unsophisticated.  The rule is that Assets minus debt divided by debt must be over some number.  If this rule is applied along with the principle that assets are marked to market it can cause two equilibria one with high asset prices and non binding capital controls and one with low asset prices and binding capital controls. </p>
<p>Here the problem is that all entities must be equally exposed to MBS risk and initially equally close to the capital requirement.  In the real world different entities have different capital requirements.  In particular capital requirements for investment banks (set by the SEC and relaxed in 2004) are much looser than capital requirements for commercial banks.  Also hedge funds&#8217; capital requirements are set by their counter-parties and are (if this is still true) about 2%.  Plus Warren Buffet had $5 billion to spare.  Note that the firms with the most flexible capital requirements are the ones that no longer exist.  A problem for the theory.</p>
<p>More importantly,<br />binding capital requirements should cause a flow of assets from the firms with binding requirements to the ones with some slack.  This flow would, among other things, make markets thick, volume high, markets unfrozen and adverse selection drowned in the flood of liquidation by firms with binding capital requirements (note the argument works fine and the metaphor isn&#8217;t even mixed).  It is very hard to have a market frozen by adverse selection with market prices below the value of the average asset causing, via mark to market and regulations some firms to have to liquidate large amounts of assets.  Firms that have to liquidate eliminate the separating only the worst of the worst is for sale equilibrium.</p>
<p>If agents are forced to sell assets at fire sale prices any agent who isn&#8217;t in the same bind should be buying at fire sale prices.  It&#8217;s just not true that all entities in the world have binding capital controls.  The explanation is nice in theory, but doesn&#8217;t fit the facts.</p>
<p>Now all these theories would imply that the original Paulson plan could work without a huge transfer from the public to banks.  However, they don&#8217;t make sense.ù</p>
<p>Furthermore they are totally false for two more simple reasons which I put after the jump for no particular reason.</p>
<p>The theories assume that banks actually mark assets to market.  They are supposed to, but they don&#8217;t.  Page 81 of the September 20-26th Economist notes that at the end of 2007 Bank of America, Citigroup, HSBC, JP Morgan, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch marked less than half of their assets to market (which UBS Credit Suisse, Duetsche Bank and Goldman Sachs market more than half of their assets to market with Goldman Sachs over 75%).  Sorry no link.  I am working from uhm ink on deceased trees.  Note first that uhm not quite all assets are marked to market.  Note also which investment banks are still independent firms.</p>
<p>Finally, if markets are frozen and the market price makes a huge difference to balance sheets, it is easy and almost legal to manipulate the market price.  Bank A can tell bank B &#8220;we will buy 1% of your toxic sludge for twice the current price if you buy an equal amount of our toxic sludge.&#8221;  Then both can mark to that agreed price and make their balance sheets look fine (this is the favorite technique of Italian soccer teams who don&#8217;t trade players.  Each buys the contract of a player for the other and they state an absurdly high price.  They sometimes run out of cash with fine looking balance sheets).  Now transactions which count as the market to mark too are supposed to be arms length, but no one is going to be picky in the middle of a crisis.  </p>
<p>In fact, such a transaction would work without fraud if adverse selection were really a problem.  Bank A could say &#8220;I will buy some of your MBSs but I pick which ones (at random)&#8221;  that way, the expected value would be the average value of MBSs not the value of the worst of the worst.  Still not quite arms length, but not obviously fiddling the price, since it would be a sensible transaction even if balance sheets didn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Now some might think that the idea that fraudulent prices can be created when markets freeze is a fantasy.  I think it has happened.   The assets were long term calls options on European stock indices.  Long Term Capital Management was short these assets.  When it seemed fairly likely that LTCM would fail and be liquidated and when they had to liquidate to keep the balances of their REPO accounts above zero (they were excused from the 2% rule by counterparties) these assets suddenly became very risky and the market froze up.  The market price became the list price chosen by brokers who knew that no one was buying or selling.  The same brokers were LTCM counterparties.  The list price of the options became absurdly huge.  The counterparties were about to gain the right to seize the extremely valuable LTCM short positions (can seize when the mark to market value of LTCMs account at a bank is negative even if the hold for a month value is huge).  It is alleged, without proof, that investment bank brokerages listed the absurd price then secretly traded at a reasonable price.  Fact is that the market price was absurd and it was absurd in a direction helpful to the investment banks.</p>
<p>The crisis ended when the President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, William McDonough told the investment banks to cut the crap and, in effect, divide up LTCM equally among them.  It is very bad for an investment bank to anger the New York Fed.  Bear Stearns was the only investment bank which refused to co-operate.  </p>

<div>The national debt is  now too big for the national debt clock.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Way to go Team Bush.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Actually, this just demonstrates that the  major</div>
<div>problem with Sarah Palin is that she governs like a  republican.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As mayor of Wallisa she:</div>
<div>1. Cut taxes.</div>
<div>2.  Spent like a drunken sailor.</div>
<div>3.  Left her successor a massive debt.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When she took office the towns long term  debt</div>
<div>was $1 million.  When she left office it was $25  million.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>No wonder she thinks Vice president Cheney was  </div>
<div>the example she wants to follow.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After all he is the one who said that  Reagan</div>
<div>proved that deficits do not matter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you voted for Bush have you thought  about</div>
<div>how you would explain this to your  grandchildren?</div>
