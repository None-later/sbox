<p>I had the same reaction to his &#8220;we have to do something&#8221; comments on Sunday <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_09_21_archive.html#3312904511454422316">as Dr. Black</a>.  But we both, clearly, forgot the game that was being played.</p>
<p>Monday is a day of work, and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/socialism-in-on.html">Dodd has clearly prepared well</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.<br />Sec. 2. Authority to purchase troubled assets.<br />Sec. 3. Considerations.<br />Sec. 4. Oversight.<br />Sec. 5. Rights; management; sale of troubled assets.<br />Sec. 6. Maximum amount of authorized purchases.<br />Sec. 7. Funding.<br />Sec. 8. Limits on review.<br />Sec. 9. Assistance to homeowners and localities.<br />Sec. 10. Maintaining insurance parity.<br />Sec. 11. Minimizing foreclosures.<br />Sec. 12. Termination of authority.<br />Sec. 13. Increase in statutory limit on the public debt.<br />Sec. 14. Credit reform.<br />Sec. 15. Annual financial reports and audits.<br />Sec. 16. Conflicts of interest.<br />Sec. 17. Executive compensation.<br />Sec. 18. Studies and reports.<br />Sec. 19. Disclosures on exercise of loan authority.<br />Sec. 20. Special inspector general for the troubled asset program.<br />Sec. 21. Definitions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dodd, having played along with the &#8220;this is urgent&#8221; call has now presented the &#8220;if this is so urgent, show us what it&#8217;s really worth to you&#8221; card.</p>
<p>All the players may not yet be ready to go all-in, but the stakes are getting higher, and the <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/opening-for-maverick-by-digby-ed.html">planned abstention from the McCain campaign</a> may soon look as if it is lack of leadership.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll end on a sad note. As Brad DeLong said <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/paul-krugman-vi.html">in an earlier post</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Dodd looks like a plan I can get behind&#8211;a serious attempt to solve the problem, preserve accountability, and balance the equities. Too bad he isn&#8217;t the VP nominee.</p></blockquote>
<p>But someone who opposed the bastardisation of FISA would have energized the base, and we can&#8217;t have that in Democratic politics.</p>

                                <p>By Steam Fangs Palin  (Tom Bozzo)</p>
<p>On 60 Minutes, John McCain helped resolve a couple of issues that occupied the comments last week.</p>
<p>Q1. Did McCain <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/5968654274175468894/#721028">support Gramm-Leach-Bliley</a>?
<p>A: Yes, and he still does!</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>PELLEY: In 1999, you were one of the Senators who helped pass deregulation of  Wall Street. Do you regret that now?</p>
<p>MCCAIN: No.  I think the deregulation was probably  helpful to the growth of our economy.</p>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Quote via <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2008/09/22/mccain-doesnt-regret-financial-dergulation-says-it-was-helpful/">Firedoglake</a>.)</p>
<p>Q2. Is McCain going to <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/5968654274175468894/#721138">outflank Obama with a populist volte-face on the bailout</a>? (See also <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/excess-of-responsibility/">Krugman</a>.)</p>
<p>A: Not as long as reporters can recall their ability to do a Google.  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080921/ap_on_el_pr/financial_meltdown_candidates;_ylt=AiyilNMMPbkRo1vD2UBk2EGs0NUE">Via the AP</a>:<br />
<blockquote>In the [60 Minutes] interview, McCain defended the Bush administration&#8217;s proposed bailout of financial firms as necessary, though he acknowledged it could get expensive.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to take over these bad loans,&#8221; McCain said. &#8220;And we&#8217;re going to have the taxpayer help you out. But when the time comes and the economy recovers, then anything that&#8217;s gained back is going to go to the taxpayers first.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not saying this isn&#8217;t going to be messy. And I&#8217;m not saying it isn&#8217;t going to be expensive. But we have to stop the bleeding,&#8221; McCain said.</p></blockquote>
<p>None of this is to say that McCain won&#8217;t continue his pattern of <a href="http://www.thecarpetbaggerreport.com/flipflops">rampant flip-flopping</a> by at least trying to stake out positions both for and against the bailout — as Obama deftly calls it, an &#8220;<a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/obama_on_economy_mccain_has_ha.php">election-time conversion</a>&#8221; — or running against all the fatcats <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/mccain_calls_for_end_to_the_ty.php">except for Carly Fiorina</a> and Phil Gramm (worth every penny!).  And it stands to reason that the Republicans will <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/opening-for-maverick-by-digby-ed.html">run against the &#8220;horrible big-government program&#8221;</a> of the Bush administration, though of course they&#8217;ll also run against the Democrats for obstructing the vital economic recovery program of the Bush administration as the situation presents itself.</p>
<p>PLUS: Mirabile dictu, could it be that congressional Democrats are getting the Administration to<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=a4q2..MUPsoA&#038;refer=home"> concede to the major features of the bailout plan a la Dodd and Frank</a>?* With, in particular, equity dilution now part of the deal with Treasury, the revised bailout (Dodd discussion draft <a href="http://www.politico.com/static/PPM41_ayo08b28.html">here</a>) looks to be a huge substantive improvement over the DOA blank-check plan, and has garnered early favorable reviews from <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/CalculatedRisk/~3/399987786/dodd-plan.html">CR</a>, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/22/dodd/">Krugman</a>, and (with some more specifics) <a href="http://www.creditslips.org/creditslips/2008/09/the-dodd-bailou.html">Adam Levitin</a> at Credit Slips.  Bloomberg suggests that Republicans may bolt, but they won&#8217;t make things easy for McCain if they end up opposing the plan for being too tough on financial executives and too easy on stressed homeowners.</p>
<p>* From one perspective, this could be terrifying as it may signal that Treasury really sees itself as staring into the abyss.</p>

<p>February 26, 2008 I <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/how-are-we-going-to-fix-money-from.html">posted a question</a>: <strong>How are we going to fix a money from money economy</strong>.  Quoting that post: There is a nice chart. (A few actually). Especially <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Profits_Finance_vs_Manufacturing.jpg">this one</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>And this:<br />
<blockquote>Total financial turnover went from $17,804 billion in 1980 to $508,456 billion in 2000. We&#8217;ve seen GDP go from 37.8% of turnover to 1.9% of turnover. That&#8217;s how big the money from money train is. Our GDP is only 1.9% of the money from money machine.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The first response in comments was: &#8220;Fix what?&#8221;  <br />I think that person has their answer now.</p>
<p>October 6, 2007 <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/money-from-money-not-good.html">I posted</a>: <strong>Money from money, not good</strong>.</p>
<p>It was about an interview by Bill Moyers of John Bogle.  He noted:<br />
<blockquote>JOHN BOGLE: Well, it&#8217;s gotten misshapen because the financial side of the economy is dominating the productive side of the economy&#8230;We&#8217;ve become a financial economy which has overwhelmed the productive economy to the detriment of investors and the detriment ultimately of our society. </p>
<p>I want to come back to the difference between the financial system and the productive system. The productive system adds to the value of our economy. And, by and large, the financial system subtracts. And, yet, it&#8217;s growing and growing and growing. And this short term thing where short term orientation in which trading pieces of paper is regarded as a social value. It is not a social value.</p></blockquote>
<p>Go listen to it.  Then listen to Mr. Moyers latest interview with <a href="http://www.pbs.org/moyers/journal/09192008/profile.html">Kevin Philips</a>.<br />
<blockquote>
<blockquote>But what&#8217;s here that doesn&#8217;t get the attention is the United States in the last 20 years undertook an enormous transformation of itself with no attention paid. And what it means is and what makes all this so frightening is the country is at risk because of the size of the financial sector that has never been graded on its competence and behavior in any serious way. They are the economy at this point. And we are now seeing what happens when a 20 to 21 percent of GDP financial sector starts to come unglued. <br />You had essentially a financial sector that, let&#8217;s say, was sort of neck and neck with manufacturing back in the late 1980s. But they got control in a lot of ways in the agenda. Finance has been bailed out. I mean, everybody thinks this is horrible now what we&#8217;re seeing in terms of bailouts. Even a lot of the people who do it think it&#8217;s bad. </p>
<p>This has been going on since the beginning of the 1980s. Finance has been preferred as the sector that got government support. Manufacturing slides, nobody helps. Finance has a problem, Federal Reserve to the rescue. Treasury to the rescue. Subsidies this, that, and other.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I am certain we have to do something to help the money flow such that it does not take down the entire system.  It would be cutting off our noses to spite our faces not to protect ourselves from what a few have done.  We have to be adults, suck it up and clean up the alcohol aroma vomit all over our bathroom. </p>
<p>But, we do not have to let it happen again.  There is only one solution to this and no one, not anyone is pointing it out: <strong>Put the financial sector of the economy back in alignment with the productive sector.</strong>  What got us in this mess is our (well not all of us) belief that the financial sector can stand on it&#8217;s own as a primary wealth/money creator.  It can not.  Never could.  But, believing it put the impetus to the creation of “vehicles” for creating trades.  You know all those securitized whatevers, and alphabet monikers, and insurance for insurance for insurance based on alphabet monikers of securitized whatevers.  What did people expect would happen when you turn the part of your system that is dependent on activity in an other part for it&#8217;s existence into a stand alone money creator.  If you are going to keep generating money from money, then you are going to have to keep coming up with new “product”.  New designs, new marketing to create an need and want, new packaging, BRANDING. <br />Again, Mr. Philip put&#8217;s it this way: <br />
<blockquote>But we&#8217;ve seen the central component of the rise of the financial sector is the rise of the debt industry. Mortgage, credit cards, all these gimmicks that Wall Street sells&#8211; just all kinds of products. And, of course, the products are laying an egg all over the world right now.</p></blockquote>
<p>Get it?  We take an industry subservient to the needs of production and turn it into a competitor of production.  I can polish and sell rocks without a bank to borrow from.  I can accumulate wealth over time.  My business may grow slowly and so may my wealth, but I can do it.  But, remove all none financial activities and what does financial do to survive?  What does it do to survive with no one needing a loan, backing, no desire to produce in a way that increases our productivity such that we have more time to purse happiness (that constitution purpose)?  We treat finance as if it is the chicken/egg question.  It is not.  Finance came second and is dependent.</p>
<p>For those from the 80&#8217;s, we have now learned exactly what was being said when we were told our economy was moving toward a service economy.  We were told it was just as good, solid and viable as the producer economy so get trained and be ready.  Remember that?  Remember those who said no way, it can&#8217;t work?  Have you watched the movie Other People&#8217;s Money yet?  </p>
<p>Well, all we do now is complain about the cost of the service economy sector known as health care.  It cost too much.  And, we have now proven that the service economy sector known as finance can&#8217;t create any real material wealth as a prime generator.  So, why is no one talking about the need and means to realign our economy?</p>
<p><strong>HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS?  HOW MANY FREAKIN&#8217; TIMES DO WE HAVE TO LEARN THE LESSON?</strong>  </p>
<p>According to Mr. Philips:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s been a bipartisan phenomenon. You can go back to the 1980s and say Reagan and George Bush, Sr., got a bubble started. Clinton got in and got an even bigger bubble going. And then George W. Bush with the biggest bubble of all. But it&#8217;s not that the Clintonites didn&#8217;t play. They did. Bob Rubin as Secretary of the Treasury — I mean, if he was a Hindu and he was being reincarnated, he&#8217;d come back as a pail because this guy bailed out everything you can imagine. They had the Mexican loan bailout. They had the long-term capital management bailout, the Russian Southeast Asian currency bailouts. </p></blockquote>
<p>Think about any of the concerns voiced here at AB regarding this current “crisis” and read <a href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/20/progressive_conditions_for_a_b/">Dean Baker&#8217;s </a>list of <strong>Principles for Restructuring the Financial System </strong>and ask how much of this could be accomplished by simply realigning our economy such that finance is in service to our needs of producing primarily and I guess consume in part.  Putting it another way, none of what Mr. Baker is suggesting can come to fruition such that we protect ourself from repeating this experience for a 3rd time (fourth if you count 1987) unless we get our minds back to how true wealth and money are created.  Which I happen to post on October 8, 2007: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html">Human Capital </a><strong>is where it&#8217;s at</strong>. It reports on a World Bank study from 2005 in which I us the quote:<br />
<blockquote>The rest of the story is intangible capital. That encompasses raw labor; human capital, which includes the sum of a population&#8217;s knowledge and skills; and the level of trust in a society and the quality of its formal and informal institutions. Worldwide, the study finds, &#8220;natural capital accounts for 5 percent of total wealth, produced capital for 18 percent, and intangible capital 77 percent.</p></blockquote>
<p>All of this relates to some graphs I put up December 12, 2007 in: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/its-big-one-honey-i-know-it.html">It&#8217;s the big one </a><strong>honey, I know it</strong>, showing that personal income for the 99% had fallen below personal outlays since 1996.  Something that had not existed since 1941 but was present from 1929 and before.   What I found most interesting from that post was that there were only 9 comments.  Just 9.  Are we going to pretend income distribution is not part of this current crisis?  Are we the 3 monkeys of see, hear, speak no income inequality?</p>
<p>So, we can talk about the hundreds of billions, we can total them up, we can debate ethics, we can talk morals and argue who is being partisan and what regulation is needed, what&#8217;s fair or&#8230;.we can face the fact that who we think we are is not who we are; that we have been blowing smoke up our own butts regarding wealth, money, economy and the pursuit of happiness.  It&#8217;s intervention time folks.  Just putting up road blocks to the elixir&#8217;s and potions, or setting up games with ourself without changing our world view about what money is and how wealth is created and why we want to create it in the first place won&#8217;t cut it.  </p>
<p>We use to know all this.  It is represented in our Declaration of Independence and our Constitution.  An example of the materialization of our realization was put in place in our tax code as we learned the lessons we are relearning now.  For example, an instance of need of integration in our thinking, one issue with the current crisis is the mega pay of those that created the mess.  Well, one of the reason&#8217;s for having a graduated income tax to the point of 90% at the top was to prevent exactly what we are now discussing as one of the issues that needs to be addressed in the bailouts.  It was to prevent economic royalty, to preserve democracy, to assure one voice – one vote, to prevent some from being so powerful that they would be insulated from responsibility for the problems they could create.  But we&#8217;re not hearing about taxing as a solution.  One that worked very well because it addressed many of our goals.  No, we now will create an entire new set of rules and paper filing&#8230;a new game to address one aspect of a crisis of one aspect of our economy because we have <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/opus-1-discussion-on-taxation.html">isolated taxation </a>as <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/opus-1-second-movement-on-taxation.html">an issue of personal freedom </a><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/opus-finale-discussion-on-taxation.html">as oppose to an integrated tool</a> of our economy based on our goals as laid out in our founding documents. </p>
<p>How small the discussion has been during this crisis so far.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not been a Good Weekend for me to read Berkeley-based Economists. (Though DeLong is <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/if-i-were-runni.html">on fire, in a good way</a>, and has been since that initial post.)</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/09/anatomy-of-a-cr.html">Mark Thoma</a>, <a href="http://dailystaregypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=16596">this</a> from Barry Eichengreen:<br />
<blockquote>In the United States, there were two key decisions. The first, in the 1970’s, deregulated commissions paid to stockbrokers. The second, in the 1990’s, removed the Glass-Steagall Act’s restrictions on mixing commercial and investment banking. In the days of fixed commissions, investment banks could make a comfortable living booking stock trades. Deregulation meant competition and thinner margins. Elimination of Glass-Steagall then allowed commercial banks to encroach on the investment banks’ other traditional preserves.</p>
<p>In response, investment banks branched into new businesses like originating and distributing complex derivative securities. They borrowed money and put it to work to sustain their profitability. This gave rise to the first causes of the crisis: the originate-and-distribute model of securitization and the extensive use of leverage.</p>
<p>It is important to note that these were unintended consequences of basically sensible policy decisions. </p></blockquote>
<p>Consequences?  Yes.  Unintended??? Not a chance in the world.</p>
<p>Now that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/goldman-morgan-to-become-bank-holding.html">the final step has been taken</a>, can anyone deny that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/john-mccain-phil-gramm-and-us-financial.html">Phil</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/secretary-of-treasury-phil-gramm.html">Gramm</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/08/24/jim-leach-obama-supporter_n_120976.html">Jim Leach</a>, and <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/va.general/browse_thread/thread/cd47fe4b558d1b92?pli=1">Tom Bliley</a> knew exactly what they were doing?</p>

<p>In one of the biggest changes to Wall Street in decades,<br />Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, the last two independent<br />investment banks, will become bank holding companies, the<br />Federal Reserve said Sunday night.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/">RGE Monitor</a> carries a lot of analysis such as it is.  I am going to ask people at work if they have followed or noticed any of the news on this business&#8230;and their understandings.  A couple posts worth I hope.</p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/bailout-plan-oops-get-out-big-checkbook.html">The draft proposal</a> is reviewed and linked on stormy&#8217;s post and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/solidary-pt-2.html">Tom&#8217;s post Solidarity Pt. 2</a>.

<blockquote><p>Following the lead of his buddy, and probable Secretary of the Treasury, Phil Gramm, McCain has been a vehement deregulator. Here is the deathless quote: &#8220;Opening up the health insurance market to more vigorous nationwide competition, as we have done over the last decade in banking, would provide more choices of innovative products less burdened by the worst excesses of state-based regulation.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>State capitalism is brought to you by neo-con Republicans and docile Democrats.  We have recieved maybe a few hundred to a couple thousand in rebates, borrowed from us, and have just been billed seven thousand or so a person for this current catastrophe.</p>
<p>Check your savings or retirement account and subtract a bit over $7,000.  If you do not blink, do you still want to vote for the people who brought you government ownership of financial companies?  Secretary of the Treasury Phil Gramm?</p>
<p>[Show of hands of all those who want Phil Gramm to have unfettered, uncontested use of that $700B for 20 months?? &#8211; klh]</p>

                                <p>CNN does some he-said, she-said, but <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/21/news/economy/bailout_proposal_Sunday/index.htm">throws in some data</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The administration&#8217;s proposal also requests that Congress authorize an increase to the nation&#8217;s debt ceiling. Currently, it&#8217;s set to rise to $10.6 trillion for fiscal year 2009 &#8211; which runs from October 2008 through September 2009. But the proposal requests that limit be increased to $11.315 trillion to allow for the purchases of mortgage-backed assets. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, strangely, I have always heard that assets have a positive value.  When I buy $100 worth of a stock—say, PWND—my Net Asset Value doesn&#8217;t change.  The same should be true of buying a MBS worth $0.30 on the dollar.</p>
<p>So why would we need to increase the deficit ceiling by $700,000,000,000 if we&#8217;re buying assets worth $700,000,000,000?</p>
<p>The only reasonable conclusion is that we plan to pay $700,000,000,000 <strong><em>above market</em></strong> for the securities.  No wonder it has to be &#8220;clean and quick.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>Henry Paulson promises that he will spend the 700,000,000,000 of our dollars over which he wants total control wisely.  I say he be required to put his money where his mouth is.  Ask him how much he expects them to be worth after he has spent them on mortgage backed assets and tell him he pays 1/1,000 th of losses beyond that up to 10 million (he has them) and gets 1/1,000 th of all profits (that is if we end up with more than $ 700 billion he keeps one one thousandth of the difference.</p>
<p>He would get even paler if his money were on the line.</p>
<p>Also, I think if any firm sells stuff to the treasury, the officers of that firm should be required to put up 1% of the money and get 1% of the revenue generated by the assets their firm sold and 1% of proceeds from sale of those assets.</p>
<p>That way, if they are good stewards of their shareholders wealth, they will still dump their worst junk on the treasury (and pigs will fly). Otherwise they will try to unload at fair value (if they make a profit they get sued.  If they make a loss for the treasury they hurt their pocket books).  </p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The &#8220;Draft Proposal for Bailout Plan&#8221; is <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/business/21draftcnd.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">now available.</a> What to make of it? Well, it certainly is sweeping and simplistic. I have two complaints. The first complaint is that it gives to one individual enormous, unchecked power. My second complaint is that the very individuals we now must trust have in part led us into this impasse. They are the ones who should have acted sooner, the ones who should have sounded the alert much, much earlier.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we are now left with few, if any, options. Nonetheless, I will register my complaints&#8230;and my anger.</p>
<p>With the only restriction that the financial institution be headquartered in the U.S. or any of its territories, Secretary Paulson now has carte blanche to purchase and then sell any mortgage related asset. No law can check him; no law governs him. He is restricted only by Title 5, Section 3109 of the <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/uscode-cgi/fastweb.exe?getdoc+uscview+t05t08+207+0++()%20%20AN">United States Code</a>, which means he can hire temporary help for a period not to exceed one year.</p>
<blockquote><p>Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.</p></blockquote>
<p>Clear the books. Clean the slate. Put on your best smile. The former CEO of Goldman Sachs is coming to the rescue.  He cannot be held accountable to any law. His word is final and absolute. We have given him a very, very big checkbook.</p>
<p>Goldman Sachs? That was one going to be one of the dominoes slated to fall, was it not? Has the fox entered the hen house and can now have his way with all the chickens? Does he deserve our trust? Has he earned it?</p>
<p>Many hands brought us here, including Congressional ones, as our shadow banking system became less regulated, as restrictions were removed for what banks could and could not do. Nonetheless, those who are <i>now</i> charged with our financial system&#8217;s safe keeping were asleep at the wheel, drunk perhaps, from the party that has raged through the latter half of this decade. They should have seen the cliff over which we now have plunged, but they did not.</p>
<p>Blame Congress or blame Greenspan if you want. Bernanke has had almost three years at the helm; Paulson has had two plus years. Both men were expected to understand the issues when they accepted their responsibilities. They were obliged to tell us honestly and truthfully. If Congress had made mistakes or if Greenspan had failed, they should have told us&#8230;pointedly, frankly. To do less was a dereliction of duty.</p>
<p>And what have we witnessed as this festering, unregulated sore has grown? We have seen the application of larger and larger band aids. &#8220;More band aids and pray&#8221; seems to have been the Paulson-Bernanke motto. Now, because we have no option, we are forced to place our trust in both of them.</p>
<p>Belief in them is no longer an option; it is an imperative.</p>
<p>History, I suspect, will not share that assessment. This economy has been ill for some time.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, what <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A38725-2005Apr8.html">Paul Volker said</a> three years ago, in April of 2005:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yet, under the placid surface, there are disturbing trends: huge imbalances, disequilibria, risks &#8212; call them what you will. Altogether the circumstances seem to me as dangerous and intractable as any I can remember, and I can remember quite a lot. What really concerns me is that there seems to be so little willingness or capacity to do much about it&#8230;.A vulnerable financial/banking system. We live in a global laissez faire financial system that is highly leveraged with debt financing, derivatives and fractional reserve banking. Hedge funds are not really “hedged,” but highly speculative, and another collapse along the lines of Long Term Capital Management could be disastrous.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now consider one of <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/ask/20080125.html">Henry Paulson&#8217;s band aids</a> in January of 2008:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. economy is fundamentally strong and will continue to grow in the short term. But, growth is slowing down markedly as the housing correction, capital market turbulence and high oil prices are taking their toll. So while I expect our economy to continue growing, the risks are to the downside. Recognizing this, the President decided that the time had come to take steps to protect our economy. He directed me to work with the Congress to enact an economic growth package quickly, to boost economic growth and job creation this year&#8230;. </p>
<p>To have an impact on our economic growth this year, we have to work with the Congress to enact legislation quickly. I have been very engaged with leaders of both parties in Congress, who share our commitment to getting legislation in place that can boost economic growth and job creation this year. I’m glad we reached agreement with the House, but our work isn’t done until this legislation reaches the President’s desk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The economy needed a bit of stimulus. &#8220;Keep moving to the mall, folks.&#8221; Was this a political decision in an election year?</p>
<p>In December of 2007, <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/ask/20080125.html">Paulson was somewhat aware</a> of the sub prime problem, but where was his focus?</p>
<blockquote><p>Mortgage market financial innovation has benefited the U.S. economy and U.S. homeowners; it has also introduced some of the challenges we face today. <i>Financial innovation led to the creation of mortgage products that put homeownership within the reach of more people.</i> At the same time, innovation also made riskier loans – with no down payments or minimal documentation &#8211; more widely available. Similarly, securitization has brought benefits and challenges &#8211; making more capital available for mortgages, but creating greater market complexity. As a result, we now have an array of different market participants, often with different interests&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Even in December of 2007, Paulson had a hard time understanding that unregulated, un-transparent financial innovation was bringing us closer and closer to the precipice. The problem, he thought, might certainly be tidied up because the HOPE NOW Alliance</p>
<blockquote><p>has brought the resources of investors to bear to enable non-profit mortgage counselors to be more widely available</p></blockquote>
<p>We are entering the jaws of the most serious financial crisis since the Great Depression and he is talking about &#8220;more non-profit mortgage counselors&#8221;? You have to be kidding&#8211;&#8220;non-profit,&#8221; no less.</p>
<p>And what was <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/bernankebunning11212005.pdf">Bernanke saying in 2005</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Moreover, the agencies have made clear that no bank is too big too fail, so that bank management, shareholders, and uninsured debt holders understand that they will not escape the consequences of excessive risk-taking. In short, although vigilance is necessary, I believe the systemic risk inherent in the banking system is well managed and well controlled.</p></blockquote>
<p>No bank is too big to fail? Hmmmmmmmm.</p>
<p>The bottom line is: These men are supposed to know the terrain, the data. They are not supposed to be surprised. They are not supposed to apply ever-larger band aids and then say, &#8220;Oops&#8230;bring out the hacksaw; we need to do foxhole brain surgery. (The comparison to the Iraq War has not escaped me.)</p>
<p>Does anybody know what he is doing?</p>
