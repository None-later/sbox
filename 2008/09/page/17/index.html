                                <p>Reader <a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/09/fannie-freddie-and-alternative-form-of.html">OSO</a> has a slant on Freddie and Fannie:</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, GSEs of the size and purpose of Fannie and Freddie<br />are missing from more &#8220;socialist&#8221; economies than the US. It seems that<br />they are an aberration in both free-market economies and social democracies.</p>
<p>The nationalisation of Freddie and Fannie was not the best solution. A<br />better solution would have been to spend the same amount of money on a<br />one-off universal mortgage payment. This would be in the form of a<br />voucher sent to homeowners who would then use it to pay off a<br />significant amount of their mortgage debt. This would have helped<br />prevent many foreclosures, helped banks remain solvent and would have<br />eventually found its way into benefiting shareholders of Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p>Quotes:<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />The first question is &#8211; why did the US even create these monsters? Yes,<br />yes, their basis was in The New Deal, which, to all pro-market Americans<br />means it was doomed to fail. But, even from a Social Democratic point of<br />view, the creation of a government sponsored enterprise (GSE) that<br />dominates an economy&#8217;s mortgage sector by guaranteeing loans is rather<br />weird. I might be wrong here, <em>but as far as I know, no Western nation<br />with a more leftist economy than the US (ie all of them) has similar<br />institutions.</em>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />Of course such a bailout means that the government has taken upon<br />themselves massive amounts of debt, along with having to buy the<br />shareholders out. I don&#8217;t know exactly how much money this is going to<br />cost the federal government, but it is a substantial amount and will<br />significantly add to the amount of net public debt already in place. But<br />I can&#8217;t help thinking that there could have been a better solution.<br />Instead of spending all this money to keep shareholders happy, why not<br />divide the money by the amount of money all people owe on their<br />mortgages and then grant them a once off government funded mortgage<br />subsidy, an amount which will be proportional to the amount they owe in<br />their mortgage?</p>
<p>In simple terms, this would mean that all borrowers would receive a<br />voucher from the Federal Government that they would then mail off to<br />their lenders &#8211; the effect being a reduction in their total mortgages.<br />That influx of money would not only prevent a whole swathe of ordinary<br />Americans from foreclosure, but, as the money circulates, would also<br />help prevent some banks from closure, prevent some mortgage companies<br />from going bankrupt and, of course, help Fannie and Freddie&#8217;s bottom<br />line. Rather than throwing money at the shareholders, the Federal<br />government could have helped ordinary homeowners and the entire market<br />that depends upon them.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />To be honest, I&#8217;m all for Fannie and Fred&#8217;s closure. Whatever good they<br />were able to achieve in the mortgage market can be replaced by private<br />enterprises, better rules and regulations and the enforcement of such<br />regulations. The death of Fannie and Freddie will not ruin the mortgage<br />market, but will hopefully make it leaner and, hopefully, less subject<br />to overspeculation and investment bubbles. The intention behind the<br />creation of Fannie and Freddie is not to be questioned, but the results<br />must be.</p>

<p>What with the new <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/97xx/doc9706/09-08-Update.pdf">CBP Report showing the growing deficit</a> (warning:  PDF file!!!), I thought I&#8217;d update <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/white-house-on-taxes-and-budget-brief.html">a post I wrote a few months ago</a>.  Here&#8217;s the post in its entirety:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s a short collection of White House quotes on taxes and the budget &#8211; one for each year of the Bush Administration.</p>
<p>2001. From the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/budtoc.html">President&#8217;s Blueprint, Feb 28, 2001</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The President&#8217;s plan will accelerate this trend to record rates by retiring an historic $2 trillion in debt over the next 10 years. Under the President&#8217;s budget, the national debt will be only seven percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2011, its lowest share in more than 80 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>2002. From a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2002/06/20020607-5.html">White House Economic Fact sheet, June 7, 2002</a>: <br />
<blockquote>The War and Recession &#8212; Not the Tax Cuts &#8212; Drained the Budget Surplus</p></blockquote>
<p>2003. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2003/02/20030203-6.html">White House Fact Sheet, Feb 2003&#8243;</a><br />
<blockquote>The budget would be in double digit deficit if had there never been a tax cut in 2001. </p></blockquote>
<p>2004.<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2004/01/20040120-7.html">GW&#8217;s SOTU, Jan 20, 2004</a>:<br />
<blockquote>By doing so, we can cut the deficit in half over the next five years.</p></blockquote>
<p>2005.  <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/10/20061011-6.html">White House Fact Sheet, Oct 11, 2005</a><br />
<blockquote>Today, President Bush Announced That The Deficit Has Been Cut In Half 3 Years Ahead Of His 2009 Goal And That The FY2006 Budget Deficit Was $248 Billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>2006. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2006/10/20061011-7.html">GW Bush, Oct 11, 2006</a><br />
<blockquote>Tax relief fuels economic growth, and growth &#8212; when the economy grows, more tax revenues come to Washington. And that&#8217;s what&#8217;s happened. It makes sense, doesn&#8217;t it? As businesses expand people pay more taxes, and when you pay more taxes, there&#8217;s more revenues that come to our treasury.</p></blockquote>
<p>2007. <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070719-2.html">White House Fact Sheet, July 7, 2009</a><br />
<blockquote>Following The Path Of President Bush&#8217;s FY 2008 Budget Would Lead To A Budget Surplus In 2012 Of $33 Billion. President Bush&#8217;s FY 2008 Budget lays out a detailed plan to balance the budget in the next five years while keeping taxes low. It keeps annual spending under control and addresses our long-term budgetary challenge &#8211; the unsustainable growth in entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>2008. See 3. </p>
<p>2009. GW, in an interview with a Fox News anchor:</p>
<blockquote><p>Raising taxes is a very irresponsible move by the President. It&#8217;s going to raise the deficit.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;.  come to think of it, there isn&#8217;t much to update.  I guess we&#8217;ll get an excuse or seventeen I could pop in for 2008, but frankly, its not that much fun any more.  It was pathetic when the administration and its defenders  were crowing back in 2005 and 2006 that somehow the president had succeeded because he had managed to mitigate a small part of the damage he had caused (i.e., there was a reduction in the deficit that he had created), and now its just sad.  Even most of the folks who were along for the ride at that time are probably willing to concede things aren&#8217;t going that well, but you can bet it won&#8217;t stop any of them from voting for the dude who promises to continue the very policies that got us here.</p>
<p>(And a special message to the trolls &#8211; if you think its somehow a coincidence that every single Democratic administration since World War 2 ended managed to cut the debt held by the public as a percentage of GDP, and that every single Republican administration beginning with Ford raised it, (data <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/sheets/hist07z1.xls">here</a>)  honestly, there isn&#8217;t enough common ground for us to have a discussion.  I will simply note that policies have consequences, and if you purposely support policies knowing damn well that they will probably make us all worse off, well, that says something about you.) <br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;- </p>

                                <p>Rules 1-99: Never make your opponent&#8217;s VP the issue. For an explanation of this rule, see below.</p>
<p>If you concentrate your attack on your opponent&#8217;s VP, you are taking the heat off your real opponent: The guy who also wants to be President, giving him a free ride. Focus on him, not on his VP.</p>
<p>If you fail to understand Rules 1-99, forget about running. Maybe you are not ready. Maybe you have bad advisers; in which case, you really are not ready.</p>
<p>Rule 100: Decide what issues advantage you and what issues disadvantage your opponent. Convince the public that your issues are more important. If you cannot convince the public, you lose. But at least you tried. Kudos.</p>
<p>Rules 101-1000: Never attack a pretty woman, especially if she has kids and is faithful. Ask any divorce lawyer who wins. If you have dogs out there that want to attack her, call them off immediately. Be a hero, not a cad. Don&#8217;t stand back and smirk.</p>
<p>Lesson over. Back to politics, hopefully not as usual. Keep checking the polls. Try <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2008/president/us/general_election_mccain_vs_obama-225.html">this</a> for starters.</p>

                                <p>A <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/public-and-private-health-care-spending.html">post</a> based on joint work with Tilman Tacke got 45 comments which is a lot for one of my posts.  Many were excellent.  One weak point is that people seem a bit obsessed with the USA.  The post discussed cross country regressions with 71 countries (The first comment started &#8220;Why only 71 countries?&#8221;).  The USA is just one data point and did not drive the result.</p>
<p>OK so now I will look at the USA in the context of the 71 other countries.  First, as we all know, the USA has an alarmingly high reported infant mortality rate given how rich we are (see table 1).  </p>
<p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/?action=view&#038;current=imusa.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/imusa.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a></p>
<p>lnim is the natural logarithm of the infant mortality rate, lnpcgdp is the log of real per capita GDP corrected for purchasing power parity, year is the year infant mortality was measured, USA is an indicator for the USA.</p>
<p>The coefficient on the US indicator is statistically insignificant (this is just one observation of US infant mortality and we are alarmed because the pattern persists over time).  The point estimate states that the US infant mortality rate is 76.8% higher than one would expect given per capita real GDP and the year.  Is is possible to learn something about what is going on with simple OLS regressions of a cross section of 71 countries ?  If you want to decide the answer read on.</p>
<p>One possible explanation, which I can&#8217;t address, is that this happens because the US counts births as live births followed almost immediately by death when other countries count similar tragedies as still births or late miscarriages. </p>
<p>A very natural guess is that this has something to do with high inequality in the USA.  This guess shows that the obsession is with the USA compared to Europe and Japan.  Compared to the average country in our data set, the USA does not have huge inequality (the share of income going to the top quintile in the USA is 46% which is less than the average among the other countries &#8212; 47%.  US inequality is anomalously high compared to other rich countries, or, in other words compared to the expected level given the Kuznets curve.  In fact, controlling for income distribution by considering separately the log per capita income of different quintiles has almost no effect on the coefficient on the USA indicator (but it does explain why there are only 71 countries in the sample).</p>
<p>Now notice my personal obsession.  The coefficient on lnq5 (log per capita income of the fifth quintile) is positive and borderline significant.  This is a pattern that was found in the old data by uhm me, not found in data from the 80s and early 90s and now it&#8217;s BAAAACK ! But not as robust as it was in old data (very robust it was ah I remember). </p>
<p>see table 2</p>
<p>OK so what is it ?  We have some other variables related to infant mortality.  Let&#8217;s toss one in.  How about female obesity ?  The USA is, you know, the fattest country in the world.  This causes the coefficient to drop see table 3.</p>
<p>How about hiv prevalence &#8212; a bit high in the USA for a super rich country.  This causes a very small decrease in the coefficient (see table 4).</p>
<p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/?action=view&#038;current=tables234.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/tables234.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a></p>
<p>How about public health care spending as a percent of GDP, the USA is a bit low compared to STATA&#8217;s guess, because the level is similar to that of other rich countries and the US is richer than other rich countries (except for Luxembourg which isn&#8217;t in the sample).</p>
<p>That gets the coefficient down to 0.33 slightly over half the original coefficient and corresponding to an increased risk of 40% of the predicted infant mortality rate.  See table 5.  </p>
<p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/?action=view&#038;current=table5.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/table5.jpg" border="0" alt="Photobucket"></a></p>
<p>So a few variables (really 2 as hiv prevalence doesn&#8217;t do much) account for about half of the mystery in an OLS sense.</p>

<p>A MODEST NOTE on the use of Present Value in Social Security propaganda</p>
<p>I should begin by saying that I have nothing against the use of  <br />present value (PV) calculations being used to make honest comparisons  <br />between various options across time.  What I am concerned with here  <br />is that they can be used to mislead the unwary.</p>
<p>Consider</p>
<p>The present value of 10 dollars 100 years from now at 3% real  <br />interest is 52 cents.  There are a number of traps in even this  <br />simple statement, but the one I want to deal with today is this:</p>
<p>I can buy dinner today at a cheap restaurant for 10 dollars.  Does  <br />that 52 cent present value mean I can go into a restaurant a hundred  <br />years from today and buy dinner for 52 cents?  Of course not.  What  <br />present value says is that if I take 52 cents today and invest it and  <br />get 3% over the rate of inflation for a hundred years I will have 10  <br />dollars and can buy dinner with it then.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s nice.  But this is not the way we usually budget our  <br />groceries.</p>
<p>More to the point, when they tell you that the PV of your taxes, paid  <br />today, is more than the PV of the benefits you will receive in 40  <br />years&#8230; or that the PV of benefits a hundred years from now is less  <br />than the PV of benefits paid yesterday&#8230; they are relying on this  <br />optical illusion to make you think some great big huge horrible  <br />injustice or inequity is being committed.</p>
<p>The present value of that ten dollars a hundred years from now may be  <br />52 cents, but in a hundred years it will still cost 10 dollars for  <br />that dinner&#8230; remember these are real dollars, we have discounted  <br />inflation.</p>
<p>It would be nice if we could all set aside 52 cents today and not  <br />have to worry about finding enough for dinner in a hundred years.   <br />But we can&#8217;t.  In the first place, we have to buy dinner today&#8230; for  <br />all the family, including granny over there in the corner.  Forgotten  <br />but not dead.</p>
<p>In the second place, NO one can guarantee anything for the next 100  <br />years, much less an interest rate 3% above the rate of inflation.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Social Security is pay-as-you-go.  Just like our daily bread.</p>

<p>Dueling Mooses &#8212;  Kristol tries to confuse the issue &#8212; FAIL!</p>
<p>William Kristol (NYT today) defends Palin as a VP pick.  Are we convinced?  Here, see what he says:<br />
<blockquote>Should voters be alarmed by a relatively young or inexperienced vice-presidential candidate? No. Since 1900, five vice presidents have succeeded to the presidency during their term in office: Teddy Roosevelt in 1901, Calvin Coolidge in 1923, Harry Truman in 1945, Lyndon Johnson in 1963, and Gerald Ford in 1974. Teddy Roosevelt took over at age 42, becoming our youngest president, and he’s generally thought to have proved up to the job. Truman was V.P. for less than three months and had been kept in the dark by Franklin Roosevelt about such matters as the atom bomb — and he’s generally thought to have risen to the occasion. Character, judgment and the ability to learn seem to matter more to success as president than the number of years one’s been in Washington.</p></blockquote>
<p>All right, Bill.  You want to compare Palin to the five VPs who stepped up to the plate since 1900?  (That&#8217;s five out of 17 presidents &#8212; pretty good odds for her to succeed to the presidency, don&#8217;t you think?)</p>
<p>The five VP presidents took office in the wake of two assassinations, (McKinley, JFK), one impeachment (Nixon), and two natural deaths (FDR, Harding,  although some believe that Harding, facing newly revealed scandals, may have been poisoned).  Truman was picked to run as VP expressly because, leading up to his fourth winning run for the presidency, FDR was known by the party to be very ill.</p>
<p>How well did the five do?  In historians &#8220;best and worst&#8221; presidents surveys, they ranged (over ten surveys)</p>
<blockquote><p>Teddy Roosevelt   3-7th  best president ever<br />Harry Truman   5 &#8211; 9<br />Lyndon Johnson   10 &#8211; 18<br />Gerald Ford   23 &#8211; 32<br />Calvin Coolidge   23 &#8212; 33</p></blockquote>
<p>Roosevelt and Harry Truman had the most gritty experience in war, the kind of experience that people often don&#8217;t survive.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;[In WWI} Truman was chosen to be an officer, and then battery commander in an artillery regiment in France. His unit was &#8230; known for its discipline problems.  During a sudden attack by the Germans in the Vosges Mountains, the battery started to disperse; Truman ordered them back into position using profanities that he had &#8220;learned while working on the Santa Fe railroad.&#8221;  Shocked by the outburst, his men reassembled and followed him to safety. Under Captain Truman&#8217;s command in France, the battery did not lose a single man.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Johnson and Ford served honourably but without any fireworks.  Coolidge never served.</p>
<p>This column wasn&#8217;t even an argument.  Kristol tries the old bait and switch here, choosing to compare 44 year old Palin to the youngest president ever in terms of their age, and then implying that she might have the qualities and perhaps experience needed to steer the ship of state through the rough waters ahead.  But compare what they did in those forty or so years.  Kristol especially mentions Teddy Roosevelt, the youngest oops president of the five.  So let&#8217;s look at the Colonel, shall we?  Before his election as Vice President&#8212;<br />
<blockquote>&#8212; He graduated Phi Beta Kappa and magna cum laude from Harvard (in Law)<br />&#8212; age 24, he wrote the definitive  book &#8216;The Naval War of 1812&#8217;,  standard history for two generations. <br />&#8212; age 24 the president appointed him to the United States Civil Service Commission, where he served for 13 years.  In his term, he vigorously fought the spoilsmen and demanded the enforcement of civil service laws.<br />&#8212; was married and widowed before age 27, was remarried to his childhood sweetheart when he was 30. Six children.<br />&#8212; built a cattle ranch in the Dakota Territories which succumbed like many others to the disastrous 1887 winter.[1]<br />&#8212; prepared for and advocated war with Spain<br />&#8212; organized and helped command the 1st U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment&#8230; during the Spanish-American War<br />&#8212; became president of the board of New York City Police Commissioners, age 37.   During the two years he held this post, he radically reformed the police department, reputed as one of the most corrupt in America.<br />&#8212; served as governor of New York.  He made such a concerted effort to root out corruption &#8230; that Republican boss Thomas Collier Platt forced him on McKinley as a running mate in the 1900 presidential election. Roosevelt was a powerful campaign asset for the Republican ticket, which defeated William Jennings Bryan in a landslide</p></blockquote>
<p>Reading all that,  just how far did Roosevelt have to rise, to &#8220;rise to the challenge&#8221;?    Not too far, I would say.  You might make an argument that McKinley had farther to rise.</p>
<p>Compare and contrast to Sarah Palin, either through the eyes of the GOP, or via Wikipedia.<br />
<blockquote>&#8212; University of Idaho Bachelor of Science degree in communications-journalism<br />&#8212; two terms on the Wasilla, Alaska city council <br />&#8212; two terms as mayor of Wasilla<br />&#8212; ran for lieutenant governor of Alaska (unsuccessful)<br />&#8212; chaired the Alaska Oil and Gas Conservation Commission and served as Ethics Supervisor of the commission<br />&#8212; elected the governor of Alaska </p></blockquote>
<p>You go for it, Bill Kristol.  Compare the self described pit bull hockey mom to Teddy Roosevelt.  Dueling bullmooses at ten paces.  (Question for bonus points:  would today&#8217;s GOP run Teddy for president?  Discuss.)</p>
<p>How Kristol can compare her to Roosevelt or even Coolidge without blushing is a mystery to me &#8212; no matter how many bull mooses she has shot.</p>

<p>[1] a fascinating novel, &#8220;Wolf Willow&#8221;, gives an grueling account of that winter, along with other historical glimpses of the area and the time.</p>

<blockquote>In response to disruptions caused by Hurricane Gustav, the DOE has indicated a willingness to release reserves from the SPR. Unfortunately, due to a continuing power outage &#8211; also caused by Hurricane Gustav &#8211; the DOE is unable to pump oil from storage.</p>
<p>Disruptions serious enough to be &#8220;economically threatening,&#8221; whatever that means, are very rare events &#8211; the U.S. has only released oil in such circumstances a few times in the SPR&#8217;s 35-year history. Power outages are also rare events. If the two kinds of events were uncorrelated, then simultaneous power outages and economically-threatening disruptions in oil supplies would unlikely in the extreme. But the two kinds of events are not uncorrelated, obviously.</p>
<p>As Platts reports, the SPR does have backup generators on site, but the generators produce insufficient power to permit pumping from storage. Any release of oil from the SPR will have to wait for power to be restored to the area. [emphases mine, but see the original&#8217;s as well]</p></blockquote>
<p>So those past seven years of adding to the Reserve can be added to the list of abject failures when the time came for them to actually perform.</p>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>From comments in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/economic-trouble.html">Cactus&#8217; post</a>: <br />“Now in the last couple of years we have seen unprecedented oil prices that have sapped our economy&#8217;s strength.” </p>
<p>Yes, we have. Others have presented this argument.  However,there was plenty of information in existence long before the &#8220;last couple of years&#8221; regarding the issue of oil price on economic performance.  This report from the IMF, <a href="http://imf.org/external/pubs/ft/oil/2000/index.htm">The Impact of Higher Oil prices on the Global Economy</a> from 12/8/2000 suggests that we have been living with such a predicament and certainly had tasted such and thus should have had better policy responses.  It is a report in response to the World Economic Outlook report of 9/2000 which “contained an extensive discussion of the potential impact of higher prices.”  It is written such that it: “includes a discussion of main policy implications for developed and developing countries. An Appendix reviews lessons from earlier oil price increases.”</p>
<p>Discussing consumption and production:<br />
<blockquote>In 2000, the price of oil has been at its highest level since the mid-1980s, excluding the brief price spike at the end of 1990. The current price hike, if maintained for any significant length of time, is likely to accentuate the trend towards energy conservation and the shift from oil to other sources of energy, especially in sectors other than transport.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, Bush et al sure proved that prediction about shifting toward conservation was wrong?  At least for US.</p>
<p>The report notes 5 means by which rising prices will effect the global economy(paralleling the WEO): <br />
<blockquote>There will be a transfer of income from oil consumers to oil producers.<br />There will be a rise in the cost of production of goods and services in the economy, given the increase in the relative price of energy inputs, putting pressure on profit margins.<br />here will be an impact on the price level and on inflation. <br />There will be both direct and indirect impact on financial markets. Actual as well as anticipated changes in economic activity, corporate earnings, inflation, and monetary policy following the oil price increases will affect equity and bond valuations, and currency exchange rates.<br />Finally, depending on expected duration of price increases, the change in relative prices creates incentives for suppliers of energy to increase production (to the extent that there is scope for doing so) and investment, and for oil consumers to economize. </p></blockquote>
<p>In the conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>For much of the period since the October 2000 World Economic Outlook was completed, oil prices have averaged $5 per barrel higher than assumed in that exercise. A sustained oil price increase of that size would imply a permanent transfer of about ¼ percent of GDP from global oil importers to oil exporters, relative to the WEO baseline, <strong>with additional transfers of income from oil consumers to oil producers within countries</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Get that last bit?  From us heart of America, working class local yokels to the producers. Windfall profits anyone?</p>
<p>The suggested policy for countries like US:<br />
<blockquote>With regard to policy implications, as experience in previous oil shocks shows&#8230; monetary policy in advanced countries will need to prevent second round price effects. This will help ensure that there is only a price level effect, but not a continuing impact on the rate of inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think they are saying raise the rates or at least not drop them without caution?  We went from4.99 in 7/1999 to a peak of 6.54 in 7/2000 to 3.77 in 7/2001 and 1.73 by 7/2002.  OH Well.</p>
<p>In the WEO report it notes specifically for the US:<br />
<blockquote>In the short term, the current fiscal stance should be maintained—and to the extent possible, strengthened—by resisting calls for tax reductions or additional expenditures. Over the longer term, the authorities’ intention to substantially preserve the fiscal surpluses in prospect, and to pay down the public debt, will help support national savings, as well as prepare for the coming long wave of unfunded liabilities associated with the retirement of the baby boom generation.</p></blockquote>
<p>We can list all sorts of “events” that happened to cause a less than desirable outcome, however, it is the response to the events that ultimately determines the final experiences.   The response is materialized in the policy adopted.  To date, the policy has failed to stabilize our economic performance, never mind improve it over the course of 8 years.  I would accept “events” as a reasonable argument for our current status if Bush et al had not performed worse than historical.  That is the <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/growth/">real GDP rate </a>from 1930 to 2000 being 3.66% vs 2001 to 2007 of 2.58%. <br />Or real GDP per capita of 2.44% 1930 to 2000 vs 2001 to 2007 of 1.61%.  Bush et al could not even perform as well as 1930 to 1940  when real GDP and GDP/capita were 2.72% and 2.00% respectively.  This 10 year period included negative growth of GDP/capita for 4 periods of: 7.14,13.46, 1.86 (1930 to 1933) and 4.19 (1937/38).</p>
<p>Bush et al&#8217;s results are pure policy and that is based on ideology and that is what this election is all about.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t know if someone else has noticed this amazing fact: in a cross country regression, the ratio of public health care spending to GDP is negatively correlated with the infant mortality rate as one would expect, but the share of private health care spending in GDP is positively correlated.  In a simple regression with including only log per capita GDP (corrected for PPP) as an additional explanatory variable, both coefficients have large t-statistics.  </p>
<p>The positive coefficient on private health care spending becomes insignificant when other variables are included, but it does not become negative.  The result is not due to the USA which is an extreme outlier in private health care spending over GDP.</p>
<p>The result is not simply due to a correlation between high public spending and low income inequality as it holds when log per capita GDP is replaced by log per capita income of each of the lower 4 quintiles (this is our original regression hence the low number of countries in the sample).</p>
<p>Update:  I hope this version of the table is legible</p>

<p>Note two countries with high leverage due to very high private health care spending compared to what one would expect given the other variables.  The most extreme is the USA which also has higher infant mortality than one would guess given per capita GDP, the year and public health care spending.  The second most extreme is Uruguay which has the infant mortality one would expect given the other variables.  </p>
<p>If I drop them the coefficient on private health care spending as a fraction of GDP goes up (you can see that it would in the scatter) to 0.150 from 0.134.  The t-stat *increases* from 3.12 to 3.16 which is not what I expected.   </p>
<p>dumping just the USA (which I have done ten times by now) gives a coeff of 0.117 and a t-state of 2.85.</p>
<p>The country with the highest infant mortality residual is South Africa.  Adding HIV prevalence to the regression is one of the things that reduced the size of the strange coefficient on private health care spending.  Dropping the USA and South Africa gives a coefficient of  0.0916 with a t-stat of 2.16, that is the USA and South Africa together provide a substantial part of the apparent evidence that private health care spending is bad for health. </p>
<p>After the jump I will report regressions done partly in response to comments.  Right now I will not even try to make them easily readable (sorry) but just cut and paste STATA output with minimal explanation of variable names.  Sorry.  Click at your own risk</p>
<p>In response to comments partly.</p>
<p>First comment &#8220;why only 71 countries&#8221;.  The answer is that we were looking at income distribution and infant mortality so we only used countries where we had estimates of quintile shares of income (q1 is share of first quintile, q2 second etc).  Without consulting Tilman, I decided to replace the log per capita real income (corrected for ppp) of different quintiles with log per capita real GDP (corrected for PPP) to make a simpler table and to focus on health care expenditures.  This causes the strange positive t-stat on private spending to become alarmingly large, that is, part of the positive coefficient is due to correlation of private health care spending and inequality.  In my original post, I wrote that the coefficient was very non robust.  This is partly because I only really think about regressions which control for inequality.  Ignoring inequality (which is crazy) it is robust to many other variables with the exception of continent dummies and a combination of infant mortality related variables (each one doesn&#8217;t do it see comment thread for details).</p>

<p>lnq1 is the log of the real pc income of households in the lowest quintile.  Hex stands for health care expenditures as a percent of GDP.</p>
<p>Now to me, the interesting question is &#8220;Is private health care spending less effective than public health care spending&#8221; and certainly not &#8221; is it actually harmful as suggested by this silly regression&#8221;.</p>
<p>To answer the interesting question we (OK Tilman) ran regressions including total health care spending and just private health care spending.  the coefficient on private spending should measure the difference in effectiveness private minus public.</p>

<p>The result is not not not due to the USA the variable reg25 is a dummy variable for the USA, since the USA is the only North American country in the sample.  Dropping the USA from the regression has no effect on the results except that no coefficient on reg25 can be estimated (really zero effect I checked because I wasn&#8217;t thinking).</p>
<p>I would say that the evidence that private health care spending has a lesser effect on infant mortality than public health care spending is quite robust.  There is no way to reliably determine the direction of causation or rule out omitted variables bias, but the robustness to inclusion of other variables convinces me that neither is the full explanation.  This is relevant to reverse causation too if the newly included  variable is the original cause of bad health which then causes high private health care spending.  There is evidence in the data set that high HIV incidence causes high private health care spending.  Including HIV incidence (the variable called hiv) does not zap the t-stat, so that&#8217;s not the whole story.</p>
