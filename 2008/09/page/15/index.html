<p>If John McCain wins the November election and becomes president of the<br />United States, it is likely that he will continue to support Supply side<br />policies that have placed the government so precariously in debt. With<br />debt levels already too high, the effects of the Fannie and Freddie<br />bailout, along with declining tax revenue due to a recession, any<br />incumbent president must make difficult choices in 2009.</p>
<p>The only way to return the US government to a fiscally sound position is<br />to either increase taxes or cut spending or have some combination of the<br />two. Because of the sheer size of the possible 2009 deficit, cutting<br />military spending seems to be the only real solution.</p>
<p>If McCain and Palin win the White House in 2009, it is unlikely that<br />they would support either a rise in taxes or a cut in military spending.<br />Any other form of spending cuts are unlikely to reduce the deficit,<br />which means that a McCain presidency is more likely to exacerbate the<br />fiscal situation than solve it.</p>
<p>In 1984 Walter Mondale lost the election because he promised to increase<br />taxes to pay back Reagan&#8217;s deficits. Now his promise is coming back to<br />haunt the Republican party and the memory of Reagan.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/09/mccain-money-and-mondale.html<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />Quotes:<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />The problem is that, for the last 25 years, the Republican Party has<br />been dominated more or less by Supply-side economics, a form of &#8220;voodoo<br />economics&#8221; which believes that tax cuts fund themselves by stimulating<br />economic growth and generating more tax revenue. While there is some<br />truth to be found in the more intellectual corners of this economic<br />system, it has resulted in a simplistic and effective myth &#8211;  that the<br />government should just keep cutting taxes.</p>
<p>After 25 or more years, popular supply-side economics has resulted in<br />nothing but large federal government deficits. Ronald Reagan&#8217;s big tax<br />cuts in the 1980s were followed by increased tax revenue but also a<br />corresponding increase in public debt. It was not until George H.W. Bush<br />raised taxes after his &#8220;read my lips&#8221; promise that Supply side economics<br />began to lose its influence. But by that stage, the damage had been done<br />and the US government was deeply in debt.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />So, fiscal irresponsibility + Fannie and Freddie Bailout + recession<br />equals a federal government with a massive debt burden that will most<br />likely exceed any comparative level of net debt in peacetime US history.</p>
<p>Of course, for regular readers, this warning of mine is nothing new. So<br />why am I repeating the fiscal alarm all over again? It is because I<br />believe that a McCain/Palin administration will continue the fiscal<br />irresponsibility started under Bush. Moreover, the inaction of the<br />Democratic-party dominated congress (elected in 2006) has allowed the<br />situation to deteriorate. If the White House continues to be Republican,<br />there is little chance that a Democratic Congress will have the<br />testicular fortitude to stand up to him and pass economically sensible<br />bills.</p>
<p>The only real chance for fiscal responsibility to return to Washington<br />is for a Democratically controlled Congress and White House. Republicans<br />have proven themselves too attached to Supply side economics for the<br />past 25 years (with the notable exception of the Gingrich years) while<br />the Democrats have not.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />Which brings to mind the prophetic words of 1984 Democratic presidential<br />candidate Walter Mondale. When discussing the Reagan tax cuts and the<br />deficits that had resulted from them, Mondale said these fateful words:</p>
<p>&#8220;By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by<br />two-thirds. Let&#8217;s tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr.<br />Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won&#8217;t tell you. I just did.&#8221;<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />It was over ten years ago that The Simpsons episode &#8220;Trash of the<br />Titans&#8221; was aired. In that episode, Homer becomes Springfield&#8217;s<br />sanitation commissioner, defeating the incumbent Ray Patterson (voiced<br />by Steve Martin), and promises a lot of crazy things for the people of<br />Springfield. Homer&#8217;s policies soon end up bankrupting his department and<br />completely ruining the city. When Ray Patterson is unanimously voted<br />back in as sanitation commissioner, he gives this wonderfully short speech:</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh gosh. You know, I&#8217;m not much on speeches, but, it&#8217;s so gratifying to<br />leave you wallowing in the mess you&#8217;ve made. You&#8217;re screwed, thank you,<br />bye.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but think of comparing Walter Mondale to Ray Patterson<br />here. Twenty-four years after his abysmal failure in the 1984<br />presidential election, Mondale could probably be justified in repeating<br />Ray Patterson&#8217;s short speech.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />by One Salient Oversight</p>

<blockquote><p>Nouriel Roubini | Sep 13, 2008 </p>
<p>It is now clear that we are again – as we were in mid- March at the time of the Bear Stearns collapse – an epsilon away from a generalized run on most of the shadow banking system, especially the other major independent broker dealers (Lehman, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs). If Lehman does not find a buyer over the weekend and the counterparties of Lehman withdraw their credit lines on Monday (as they all will in the absence of a deal) you will have not only a collapse of Lehman but also the beginning of a run on the other independent broker dealers (Merrill Lynch first but also in sequence Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley and possibly even those broker dealers that are part of a larger commercial bank, I.e. JP Morgan and Citigroup). Then this run would lead to a massive systemic meltdown of the financial system. That is the reason why the Fed has convened in emergency meetings the heads of all major Wall Street firms on Friday and again today to convince them not to pull the plug on Lehman and maintain their exposure to this distressed broker dealer.</p>
<p>Let me elaborate in much detail on these issues…</p>
<p>This bail-in of investors is the opposite of a bailout of investors like the one that was done in the case of Bear Stearns and Fannie and Freddie. It is thus akin to the bail-in of investors that was done in the case of LTCM in the summer of 1998 and the bail-in of the interbank creditors of Korean banks in the winter of 1997. I wrote in 2004 with Brad Setser an entire book titled “Bailouts versus Bailins: Responding to Financial Crises in Emerging Markets” that discusses these policy tradeoffs in financial crises where you have runs on the liquid liabilities of either illiquid and/or insolvent countries. Those were the international equivalent of the banks runs and financial crises that we are now seeing in the cases of Bear Stearns, Lehman and Fannie and Freddie.</p>
<p>Since government bailouts put at risk public money and create moral hazard Treasury and the Fed decided that they need to draw a line somewhere after the bailouts of Bear Stearns creditors, of Fannie and Freddie and all the other actions aimed at backstopping the financial system. These actions have included the creation of the TAF, TSLF, PDCF, the use of the FHLBs to provide liquidity to distressed mortgage lenders, the provision of Treasury liquidity to the FHLBs, the outright purchase of agency MBS by the Treasury, the swapping of two thirds of the safe Treasuries of the Fed for toxic illiquid securities of banks and non banks, etc. So after having created the mother of all moral hazard with their actions (including the biggest bailout of all, i.e. the rescue of Fannie and Freddie) the Fed and Treasury are playing a chicken game with the financial system. Tim Geithner told clearly to the heads of all the major Wall Street firms that if they pull the plug on Lehman and Lehman collapses they are next in line for a run on their institutions. So if a buyer for Lehman is not found (or even if it is found and the counterparty lines are still pulled) not only Lehman will collapse but the run will extend to all of the other major broker dealers and banks that are the counterparties of Lehman.</p>
<p>The Fed may delude itself in thinking – as its stress models suggest – that the systemic risk of a collapse of Lehman are less serious than those of Bear Stearns: afterall Lehman is less involved into CDSs than Bear was and now both Lehman and the other major broker dealers have access to the discount window with the PDCF. A collapse of Lehman instead will have as much of a systemic effect as the collapse of Bear for many reasons: Lehman is larger than Bear was; Lehman is a major player in a variety of key financial markets; all the other major Wall Street institutions are interconnected with Lehman in dozens of different types of counterparty activities; the PDCF support of the Fed is neither unlimited nor unconditional, i.e. investors cannot assume that Lehman or any other broker dealer can borrow unlimited amounts with no conditions from the discount window. Thus, a collapse of Lehman would trigger a panic and a potential run on all sort of other broker dealers and also on other distressed financial institutions like banks (WaMu) and insurance companies (AIG) and smaller member of the shadow financial system (distressed and highly leveraged hedge funds, etc.).</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The reason why Lehman is having a hard time to find a buyer is that it is most likely insolvent. If you had to mark to market the value of it illiquid and toxic assets (the $40 billion of commercial real estate assets, its remaining residential MBS and CDOs, its holdings of real estate private equity funds) Lehman is most likely insolvent (i.e. has negative net worth with liabilities well above its impaired assets). So leaving aside the potential and now dubious value of its franchise (an option to the value of a much slimmed down financial institution) no financial institution should be paying even a single penny to buy an insolvent firm. That is why all the potential suitors of Lehman (such as Bank of America and others) are waiting for the government to provide another sleazy Bear Stearns deal where the government would buy at higher than market value the toxic assets of Lehman (the commercial real estate assets for example) so as to make the net worth of the remaining institution positive and worth buying. But such action – borderline illegal in the case of Bear as pointed out by Paul Volcker – would be a scandal in the case of Lehman and severely exacerbate the moral hazard problem.</p>
<p>But here lies the conundrum of this Lehman crisis: no one seems to want to buy for a positive price Lehman unless there is a public subsidy (taking off their toxic assets off the firms’ balance sheet). The government cannot afford to provide the subsidy as the moral hazard problems are becoming severe. But then if on Monday no deal is done Lehman collapses and goes into Chapter 11 court and you have the beginning of a systemic financial meltdown as the run on the other broker dealers will start. Thus, what Fed and Treasury are trying to do this weekend is another 1998 LTCM bailin or Korea 1997 bailin, i.e. trying to convince all the major institutions to either support a purchase of Lehman or maintain their exposure to Lehman if no buyers is found. Can this bail-in work? It is not clear as there is a major collective action problem: you can’t only convince half a dozen major Wall Street firms to maintain their exposure to Lehman. You need also to convince all the other counterparties of Lehman (including the hedge funds and the other broker dealers and banks) not to roll off their claims and credit to Lehman. This is a much more messy collective action problem and coordination game than in the case of LTCM and Korea where the number of involved counterparties was more limited (less than 20 in each case).</p>
<p>Paulson and Bernanke and Geithner (the troika managing this financial crisis) have all made public statements in the last few month to the necessity of finding an orderly way to close down – rather than bailout – a major and systemically important non bank financial institutions: the embarrassment and losses for the Fed that the bailout of the creditors of Bear led made it paramount to avoid another Bear like bailout. That is why they are now playing tough with Lehman and its creditors. But in this game of chicken the Fed and the Treasury may end up being the ones to blink. Faced with the risk of a generalized run on the other broker dealers they may decide that greasing again a deal for the purchase of Lehman may be less costly and less risky than testing whether the system can orderly work out a collapse of Lehman (something that is highly uncertain). Even in the case of the Bank of America purchase of Countrywide such public subsidy was significant (the FHLB of Atlanta lent to Countrywide over $50 billion and Bank of America has most likely received plenty of tacit forbearance from the Fed to support its takeover of an insolvent Countrywide). So implicitly or explicitly the Fed and the Treasury may decide – however reckless and moral hazard laden that choice may be – to provide some explicit or implicit subsidy to a private purchase of Lehman.</p>
<p>The trouble is that, in spite of all public statements regarding the need to provide an orderly demise of large broker dealers, the Fed and the Treasury have done nothing to create such insolvency regime for such broker dealers. So the only option for Lehman – if a buyer is not found &#8211; will be the one of ending up in Chapter 11 and trigger massive losses on its counterparties that will in turn trigger a run on such counterparties.</p>
<p>In February of 2008 I predicted – in my “12 Steps to a Financial Disaster” – that one or two major broker dealers would go bankrupt. A month later Bear Stearns went bust and the collapse of the other ones was avoided for a time by the most radical change in monetary policy since the Great Depression, i.e. the creation of the PDCF that extended the lender of last resort (LOLR) role of the Fed to non-bank systemically important broker dealers (i.e. all of the bank and non bank primary dealers of the Fed).</p>
<p>I next argued in June that such action would not prevent a run on other broker dealers such Lehman as to avoid a run you need both deposit insurance and unlimited and unconditional access to the Fed LOLR support. I also discussed why Lehman was next in line for a collapse and why the PDCF would not prevent a run on Lehman.</p>
<p>I also argued in follow-up pieces that, in a matter of two years, no one of the remaining independent broker dealers (Lehman, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs) would survive as: 1. their business model is now impaired (securitization is semi-dead); 2. they will need to be regulated like banks given the PDCF support and thus have lower leverage, higher liquidity and more capital that will erode their profitability; 3. Their severe maturity mismatch – borrowing very short term and liquid, leveraging a lot and lending and investing in more long term and illiquid ways – makes them very fragile – in the absence of deposit insurance and in the presence of only limited LOLR support by a central bank – to bank like run that are destructive even of illiquid but otherwise solvent institutions. Thus all such broker dealers need to merge with larger financial institutions that have a commercial banking arm and thus access to stable and insured deposits and to true LOLR Fed support. That process of unraveling of independent broker dealers started with Bear Stearns; now it is moved to Lehman; tomorrow Merrill Lynch will be on line; and Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs will be next. No one of them can and will survive as independent entities. So, the Fed and Treasury should advise them all to start finding a large international partner (international as almost no domestic partner is now sound to take them over) and merge with such partner before we get another Bear or Lehman disaster.</p>
<p>The step by step, ad hoc and non-holistic approach of Fed and Treasury to crisis management has been a failure so far as plugging and filling one hole at the time is useless when the entire system of levies is collapsing in the perfect financial storm of the century. A much more radical, holistic and systemic approach to crisis management is now necessary.</p>
<p>What we are facing now if the beginning of the unraveling and collapse of the entire shadow financial system, a system of institutions (broker dealers, hedge funds, private equity funds, SIVs, conduits, etc.) that look like banks (as they borrow short, are highly leveraged and lend and invest long and in illiquid ways) and thus are highly vulnerable to bank like runs; but unlike banks they are not properly regulated and supervised, they don’t have access to deposit insurance and don’t have access to the lender of last resort support of the central bank (with now only a small group of them having access to the limited and conditional and thus fragile support of the Fed). So no wonder that this shadow banking system is now collapsing. The entire conduits/SIV system has already collapsed with the roll-off of their ABCP financing; next is the collapse of the broker dealers (Bear, Lehman and soon enough the other ones) that rely mostly on unstable overnight repos and other very short term funding for their financing; next will be hundreds of poorly managed hedge funds that will face a tsunami of redemptions; and finally runs on money market funds that are not supported by a large financial institutions or other smaller member of the shadow banking system as well as highly leveraged and distressed private equity funds cannot be ruled out either.</p>
<p>This is indeed the most severe financial crisis since the Great Depression and occurring at a time when the US is falling in a now severe consumer led recession. The vicious interaction between a systemic financial and banking crisis and a severe economic contraction will get much worse before there is any bottom to it. We are only in the third inning of a nine innings economic and financial crisis. And the only light at the end of the tunnel is the one of the incoming train wreck.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>&#8220;As the market falls aggressively, we find that there are further developments from authorities that act as ST supports for the Dow. But the real concern is that each crisis has been followed by a bigger crisis and this just does not feel like the “capitulation blow out”&#8221;</p>

<p>Also here are some observations from Barry Ritholtz about the Fannie and Freddie nationalization:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Six observations/questions/takeaways from the past of weekend rescues history:</p>
<p>1. A strong rally lasts for a while, but it eventually fades and makes a new lower low;<br />2. Each &#8220;rescue rally&#8221; has been shorter in duration and weaker in intensity than the immediately prior one;<br />3. Friday&#8217;s close becomes your new line in the sand; If and when that is breached, look out below.<br />4. The pre-Asian open news pattern reveals the Asset price focus is a large part of these issues; It also speaks to our overseas creditors/Overlords;<br />5. What form of free markets have we evolved into? It is not Capitalism, it is not Socialism, it is not intelligent regulation. WTF is this?!?<br />6. During the prior 5 interventions, the VIX was at cyclical record highs. This time, the VIX was at a much more modest level (22)</p>

<p>Militarism and Oil</p>
<p>I have been on the web figuring out what is going on with Palin, who has not had much experience with the North Atlantic, and seems to want Georgia and Ukraine to gain membership in NATO.  So I did some googling on Caspian Sea pipelines.  Interesting stuff.   Seems both Russia and Iran have interests in Caspian Sea oil exports.  Seems the larger producers of oil on the sea are Azerbaijan (bordering Georgia) and Kazakhstan on the west coast.  Viewing a map the Caspian Sea has not rivers flowing out and no connection by water to other maritime routes.  Getting oil and gas from the area is by pipeline.</p>
<p>Russia and Iran have significant issue with Kazakh oil and gas crossing the Caspian via submerged pipeline.  So Kazakh product will go east and south, making Afghanistan an interesting place for pipeline development as well as Iran.  So, why NOT make war on Iran?  The carbon swelling products need to get to China, India and Japan.</p>
<p>A more interesting issue is; what about Georgia?  There are several routes for Azerbaijan/Baku oil.  One is to a Russian republic port on the Black Sea, one is to a Georgian port on the Black Sea, and a third planned route is through Georgia and Turkey (1800 km) to a port in Turkey on the Mediterranean Sea.  Using Georgian pipelines denies Russian revenues for pipeline tariffs and maintenance.</p>
<p>For some reason Israel wants the Mediterranean-Georgian pipeline and since Israel receives much of its security funding from the US it has served as a US surrogate providing about a thousand advisors to Georgia preparing them for their escapade into Ossetia on 8 Aug 08.</p>
<p>The Russians responded defending Ossetia with their &#8220;peacekeepers&#8221; and sending the signal that Georgian pipelines are not secure and can be cut.  That does not support US oil to invest in Georgia?</p>
<p>Similarly, pipelines run through Ukraine which delivers Russian petroleum products to west Europe.</p>
<p>Considering pipeline security and the ability of the Russians to control oil and gas flow, NATO membership for Ukraine and Georgia means NATO would establish defense of US interests in pipelines and energy supplies for US pipeline companies who sell to Europe.</p>
<p>This is vastly expensive military response to externalities from oil consumption.  Response that is too expensive and counter productive.</p>
<p>More oil cowboy world affairs from Palin and Mc Cain.  When will the US need to commit two aircraft carriers to the Black Sea?<br />_________________</p>

                                <p>Some questions asked about Angry Bear moderation of comments need answered.  What it is not is a careful screening of content.  It is not even a screening for ad hominems pretty much, which might be done later if missed, but in public and noted.</p>
<p>Since deletion, disemvowelling, or other standard editing was not working due to the volume and vitrioloc nature of some of the commenters, pending moderation has been put into use.</p>
<p>Main posters come by and approve comments, but the criterion has been purposely kept extremely simple&#8230;it primarily is a way to delete the comments from those in coventry who start fights through ad hominems or slanderous comment, those in coventry who exceeded even our standards.  </p>
<p>I do not even read many comments in the process&#8230;the normal sorts of edits take care of the occasional swearing or ad hominems.  The &#8216;review&#8217; has nothing to do with political content, and does not involve editing unless clearly noted.  Enough of us moderate to make the system as close to immediate publication as is reasonable, which we think helps discussion.  You may have noticed paid sites use interns or teaching assistants&#8230;we are a working group without those particular resources. </p>
<p>So Paul, no, it is not like a magazine where letters to the editors are published after careful review to insure standards&#8230;it is a quick screening done as quickly as possible to screen out bile and slanders.  The election appears to have energised many, some of whom misbehave badly.</p>

<blockquote><p>The abuse of power investigation against Gov. Sarah Palin, the Republican vice presidential candidate, took a potentially ominous turn for her party today when state lawmakers voted to subpoena her husband.</p>
<p>Republican efforts to delay the probe until after the Nov. 4 election were thwarted when GOP state Sen. Charlie Huggins, who represents Palin&#8217;s hometown of Wasilla, sided with Democrats. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just get the facts on the table,&#8221; said Huggins, who appeared in camouflage pants to vote during a break from moose hunting.</p>
<p>Thomas Van Flein, the Palins&#8217; private attorney now representing her as governor, did not immediately return calls for comment.</p>
<p>The Senate Judiciary Committee acted at the request of investigator Stephen Branchflower, who is gathering evidence on whether Gov. Palin abused her power by firing Walt Monegan, the state&#8217;s director of public safety&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Are there any Alaskans out there who can help with the state level of politics?&#8230;this story feels incomplete from what I think I know of Alaskan politics.</p>

                                <p>A guest post to <a href="http://mudflats.wordpress.com/2008/09/12/karl-rove-comes-to-alaska/">Mudflats blog</a> is worth a look:</p>
<blockquote><p>Here’s Rep. Gara’s  take on McCain’s spin and interference with the bi-partisan “Troopergate” Investigation.  </p>
<p>Politicians are good at spin.  The McCain camp has brought a whole new level of it to our small state &#8211; in what looks like an effort to show they can play the same Karl Rove-like political games that have haunted this country for the last 8 years.  I like Governor Palin on a personal level.  But I don’t like what the McCain campaign is doing to our state.  I don’t like deception.  And I don’t like politics as usual.</p>
<p>Alaskans are starting to see evidence of a Karl Rove-like effort to stonewall what started as a non-controversial, bi-partisan ”Troopergate” investigation.  A little deception here.  A few personal attacks there.  And the kind of spin you see at an amusement park tilt-a-whirl station.   </p>
<p>This investigation was started by a Republican-dominated Alaska Legislature to look into Governor Palin’s conduct in seeking the termination of a State Trooper, once married to the Governor’s sister, Trooper Michael Wooten.  The McCain camp wants to stop it by saying it’s a “democratic” investigation.  Apart from facts, and the reputations the McCain folks don’t mind destroying, there’s not a lot standing in the way of this strategy.</p>
<p>Until August 29 “Troopergate” was a small state investigation Governor Palin, and every Republican and Democrat in a Republican-led Legislature had agreed was appropriate.  But things changed the day Governor Palin joined the McCain ticket.  His handlers went ballistic that the Governor agreed to an investigation they now needed to stop.</p>
<p>I know Senator McCain is now running on a political platform of ”change.”  Leave aside how he’ll fight to change what he’s voted to do to this country for the last 8 years.  If you ask me, the only thing he’s changed so far is Governor Palin’s position &#8211; her decision to cooperate with this once-small investigation.  </p>
<p>This is one of those cases where there’s a clear truth.  It’s a clear truth &#8211; about a bi-partisan investigation &#8211; that I hope McCain’s operatives will ultimately fail at spinning into a “partisan” plot against his running mate. </p>
<p>To get their way, and prevent sworn testimony from leaking out on what I suspect was probably a minor breach by Governor Palin, McCain’s operatives have come to Alaska to add invective in a state where people generally get along.  They’ve chosen to vilify: 1) one of the state’s most respected public officials, Senator Hollis French; 2) the state’s most respected law enforcement official, Walt Monegan; and 3) a highly respected former DA and Victims Rights advocate a legislative committee voted 12 &#8211; 0 to hire to conduct the investigation, Steve Branchflower.  </p>
<p>It’s the ghost of Karl Rove.  Say something untrue enough times &#8211; like that Al Qaida is training with Saddam Hussein’s help &#8211; and people will believe it.  Not this time.  I’m not sure if I mentioned a few important facts.</p>
<p>Did I mention that no one ever attacked the Troopergate investigation by Alaska’s Legislature &#8211; started long before Governor Palin was placed on McCain’s ticket &#8211; until August 29?  That was the day Governor Palin joined the McCain bid for the White House.  </p>
<p>Did I mention that before the McCain camp got involved, the Governor stated of the Legislative investigation:  “That being the route they choose, so be it.  I’m happy to comply, to cooperate.” (KTUU.com, July 24, 2008).  She repeatedly stated she’d comply, and that it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>Did I mention the personal attacks against our local public officials only started after Sen. McCain sent his flacks up to our small state on August 29?  They came with a mission to make America believe a Republican-initiated investigation, started with a unanimous committee vote of 8 Republicans and 4 Democrats, was a “partisan” plot.  That’s only a tough sell if people know the facts.</p>
<p>Did I mention they now claim the Legislature cannot legally proceed with an investigation into government misconduct (I thought Republicans didn’t like attorneys who made frivolous arguments), and that they are threatening to to go to court to stop it?   The Governor’s attorneys started writing those letters on &#8211; you guessed it &#8211; August 29.  Before then they agreed the investigation was proper.</p>
<p>Oh, and what about this.  Last week the McCain camp put our Governor in a bizarre position.  They told her to file an ethics complaint against herself!  Yup, again after her VP nomination.  Too weird?  What’s behind this move?  You guessed it.  Lawyers.  </p>
<p>To create the legal argument that the Legislature cannot investigate government misconduct, the McCain team has had her file a complaint against herself before something called the State Personnel Board.  That’s a 3 member group of Republican Gubernatorial appointees &#8211; that, if it started this week, wouldn’t get an investigation done, and reported to the public, until after the November election.  Convenient.</p>
<p>Hmmm.  The Legislature has announced they’d have their investigation done &#8211; if witnesses would cooperate like they were until August 29 &#8211; by October 10.  I can’t imagine why the McCain camp would prefer an investigation that doesn’t get finished until after November.  Any ideas?</p>
<p>So what about the claim that this investigation is some sort of partisan plot against a Republican ticket?  A legislative committee of 8 Republicans and 4 democrats asked former Assistant District Attorney Hollis French, a Democrat &#8211; to hire a legislative investigator in July.  He did.  He’s not doing the investigation.  So the complaint that he’s a Democrat who supports Barack Obama  is, well, weak.  He’s a Democrat who supports Barack Obama, who was appointed before Governor Palin was a VP candidate.  More importantly, he’s a Senator who has the confidence of a majority Republican Senate.  </p>
<p>He once said to the press the results of the investigation are likely to be troubling.  He shouldn’t have said that.  But the Governor’s said it too.  The newspapers have said it.  We all know it.  The public record already contains evidence that the Department of Public Safety was contacted roughly 20 times by Palin senior staff, and her husband Todd, about firing Trooper Wooten.  The Governor has conceded that based on this evidence, the public could conclude the Department could have felt pressure from above to fire Trooper Wooten.</p>
<p>The investigator, Steve Branchflower, is a former DA and Office of Victims Rights head (a job he was appointed to by a Republican Legislature).  He’s actually conducting the investigation.  Attacking Senator French doesn’t really work if he’s not investigating the case, or making any findings.  So the McCain folks have attacked Mr. Branchflower.  And they’ve tried to stop him from issuing subpoenas to the witnesses now directed not to talk.  Today the McCain folks suffered a setback.  A bi-partisan committee of Republicans and Democrats authorized Mr. Branchflower to move ahead to subpoena those witnesses.</p>
<p>And for good measure &#8211; the McCain folks are attacking Walt Monegan &#8211; the Public Safety Commissioner Governor Palin fired.  The Troopergate investigation involves claims that Monegan was fired for not agreeing to fire Trooper Wooten, the Governor’s brother in law involved in a very ugly custody dispute with the Governor’s sister.  </p>
<p>I don’t begrudge the Governor for not liking her brother-in-law.  I don’t really like him either, from what I’ve read.  I do begrudge those who’d attack Commissioner Monegan, a quintessential public servant who’s worked for both Republican and Democratic heads on the state and local level.  </p>
<p>These three public servants deserve better.  What they’ve received so far, is a little dose of ugly Washington politics in a state where we don’t see that stuff too often.</p>
<p>I stood on the sidelines when this investigation started.  When Governor Palin fired Commissioner Monegan, my advice was to end the flap and just hire him back. He does good work.  He’s well respected.  Unfortunately, my advice sometimes isn’t that good, and the Governor didn’t agree.</p>
<p>Then McCain’s staff of outsiders came to town.  And they began to launch personal attacks on people I respect.  They started proving that the same old politics that have caused dissatisfaction with Washington insiders these past 8 years are going to be the bread and butter of the McCain campaign.  </p>
<p>So &#8211; here I am today.  I support an Obama presidency because he shares a vision I believe in.  I’ve publicly supported him since the race started last year.  I also think Governor Palin originally did the right thing in agreeing to take some small lumps by proceeding with a legislative investigation Republicans and Democrats, and much of the public asked for.    </p>
<p>But unfortunately Alaska is the bull’s eye in a national presidential race today.  When told by the McCain folks that she needed to change her position, she did, as a loyal running mate.  I understand that.</p>
<p>As an Alaskan I’m not really angry at our Governor for this mess.  I do blame John McCain for the ugliness he’s brought to our state this week.   His folks have come to my small state to attack my friends, and people I respect, for political gain.  In my book, that’s not OK.  We all mess up time to time.  But this crosses the line.  </p>
<p> In small states, like small towns, people who act like the McCain folks apologize.  Until that happens, I’ll keep defending 3 public servants who deserve better.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the Washington Post, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/11/AR2008091102827.html?hpid=opinionsbox1">E.J. Dionne</a> writes an op-ed piece that captures Obama&#8217;s dilemma:</p>
<blockquote><p>The campaign is a blur of flying pieces of junk, lipstick and gutter-style attacks. John McCain&#8217;s deceptions about Baracks views and Sarah Palin&#8217;s flip-flopping suggest an unedifying scuffle over a city council seat. </p>
<p>The media bear a heavy responsibility because &#8220;balance&#8221; does not require giving equal time to truth and lies. So does McCain, who is running a disgraceful, dishonorable campaign of distraction and diversion. </p>
<p>But Obama bears responsibility, too: His task is to remind Americans that the stakes in this election are far higher than the matter of who said what and when about Palin. He isn&#8217;t doing that. </p>
<p>Nonetheless, it&#8217;s clear that Obama has lost control of this campaign. And he will not seize back the initiative with the sometimes halting, conversational and sadly reluctant sound bites he has been producing. The excitement Obama created at the beginning of the year has vanished.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: Few voters know that Obama would cut the taxes of the vast majority of Americans by far more than McCain would. Few know Obama would guarantee everyone access to health care or that McCain&#8217;s health plan might endanger coverage many already have. Few know that Obama has a coherent program to create new jobs through public investment in roads, bridges, transit, and green technologies&#8230;. </p>
<p>It should not be hard for Obama to use crisp, punchy language to force the media and the voters to pay attention to the basic issue in this election: whether the country will slowly continue down a road to decline, or whether, to invoke a slogan from long ago, we can get the country moving again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Setting aside for a moment the accuracy of E.J.&#8217;s characterization of all of Obama&#8217;s positions, I would agree that Obama has lost control of the message, at least for now.</p>
<p>McCain-Palin are fighting like pitbulls. Palin is the bait, the lure; the real pit bull is McCain, trying to shred Obama in anyway he can: Pull him off message, take away his luster. So far it has worked.</p>
<p>And where is Biden? Maybe he is whispering something somewhere in the wings.  Biden certainly is not in the fray, at least as far as the national media are concerned. Media spotlight is the name of the game.</p>
<p>Perhaps Biden should step down, realizing that right now he is adding nothing to the mud fight and let Hillary take his place. Right now, Biden is a lost cause, chosen because he brought international expertise to the ticket, chosen to counter Obama&#8217;s presumed inexperience.</p>
<p>Now that would be a counter to the McCain-Palin nonsense. Suddenly the whole field shifts; there is a new game. Palin versus Hillary. Let&#8217;s talk about who is qualified to do what.</p>
<p>While I understand the problems involved in such a change&#8211;how does Biden bow out, for example&#8211;, I am  serious about my suggestion.</p>
<p>Sorry, E.J., no amount of &#8220;crisp, punchy language&#8221; can compete with lipstick on a pig.</p>
<p>In a campaign like this, do the unexpected. Change the script.</p>
<p>Let Hillary answer the silly charges; she has far more visibility than Biden. She will be heard. She will get attention. Let Obama be on message. And let the far-right howl and show their real colors, as they desperately re-write their playbook.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>McCain <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/09/mccain-ad-obamas-lone-edu_n_125205.html">approves</a> an ad claiming Obama wants comprehensive sex education for kindergarteners, i.e., teaching toddlers &#8220;about sex before they can learn to read.&#8221; This is gutter politics.</p>
<p>Now we come to the &#8220;pig outrage.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had a heated debate with a good friend of mine&#8211;intelligent, well informed&#8211; who claimed absolutely that Obama had so slurred Palin. I asked for the link. &#8220;Google it,&#8221; was the reply. Finally, I found it. I listened.</p>
<p>Well, I can listen as well as the next guy. More importantly, I can parse sentences better than most. I know all about subjects, verbs, and objects. I know also how to understand comparisons.</p>
<p>Well, I found the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPd4yk0x-eg">link</a>&#8211;finally.</p>
<p>Obama says McCain&#8217;s policies are identical to Bush&#8217;s&#8211;and concludes by saying: You can put lipstick on a pig (Bush&#8217;s policies), but it is still a pig.</p>
<p>And then we have the McCain and Palin outrage, all because Palin had described herself as a bulldog with lipstick&#8230;.too much. McCain, the white knight, heroically runs to rescue.</p>
<p>Curiously, the Canadian press understood what was going on&#8211;and reported it accurately. It knew exactly what Obama had said. It knew exactly how it had been twisted.</p>
<p>All of this may win elections. And maybe there is an argument that McCain and Palin are playing a good game of hardball. But who wants to slide into a home plate that looks like a pigsty?</p>
<p>There are real issues out there, as I have noted time and time again. Does anyone care about America?</p>

                                <p>These are indeed uneasy times. All hands on deck.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/roubini-monitor/253549/the_wefs_financial_development_report_and_index_why_is_the_us_ranked_1_in_spite_of_its_serious_financial_instability_and_crisis">Nouriel&#8217;s blog</a>, here is a comment from London Banker, a writer and commentator for the blog:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was briefed on the proposed US financial reforms which will be shoved through with minimal review. Short version is that the Fed wins an explicit &#8220;financial stability&#8221; role which gives it powers and secrecy to do pretty well whatever Tim Geithner chooses to do for his capitalist crony clientele. The role will include comprehensive, global data collection which will give the Fed visibility of all open positions. In the wrong hands, this insight could be used to selectively induce volatility and margin calls which would selectively hurt some and advantage others. That could help the Fed&#8217;s friends over time.</p>
<p>The FDIC will be stripped of financial supervision and prudential intervention powers in favour of the Fed. That makes the Fed totally unreviewable and unchallenged by other authority in the USA.</p>
<p>Additionally, the SEC will be forcibly reformed to be more like the CFTC &#8211; a service entity for the interests of those who pay good money for bad regulators. Instead of fixed rules, SEC regulation will become &#8220;principles based&#8221; which will mean that no one is ever held accountable for breaking the law unless they have done something to break the code of omerta and anger their peers.</p>
<p>Federal law and regulation will pre-empt all state laws, and states attorney generals will be stripped of authority to investigate or sue. That means no more inconvenient Elliot Spitzers to get in the way of Wall Street excess.</p>
<p>This may not meet Professor Roubini&#8217;s recommendations, but the deal is going through with little review so far because the cries for reform are only going to be met with this one pre-agreed proposal. After all, who in Washington or Wall Street would ever suggest that Geithner, Bernanke and Paulson didn&#8217;t have the best interests of American and global investors at heart? </p></blockquote>
<p>And, from the <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-09/12/content_7020656.htm">China Daily</a>:<br />
<blockquote>China, which holds a fifth of its currency reserves in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debt, may cut the portion held in US dollars, according to China International Capital Corp (CICC), one of the nation&#8217;s biggest investment banks.</p>
<p>The US government this week seized control of the two mortgage-finance companies, which account for almost half of the home-loan market in the world&#8217;s biggest economy, to prevent defaults from crippling them. China holds up to $400 billion in the two firms&#8217; debt, CICC Chief Economist Ha Jiming said in a report Thursday.<br />&#8220;The crisis has made Chinese officials realize it&#8217;s a bad idea to put all their eggs in one basket,&#8221; wrote Hong Kong-based Ha. &#8220;This will likely lead to greater diversification of foreign exchange reserve investments.&#8221;</p>
<p><i>China held $447.5 billion of US agency bonds as of June 2008, according to the CICC calculations using disclosures by the US Treasury. It is likely to reduce the portion of reserves in dollar assets from the current 60 percent by purchasing more non-dollar assets with new reserves, he said.</i></p>
<p>Countries in Asia have stockpiled foreign exchange reserves since the 1997-98 financial crisis to act as a cushion against a run on their exchange rates. That in turn has increased pressure on policymakers to ensure higher returns from more than $4 trillion in assets.</p>
<p>China will expand its investments in corporate bonds and equities, according to Ha. Treasury and agency bonds account for 50 percent and 40 percent of total dollar assets held by the central bank, he wrote.<br />[Italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>In a year&#8217;s turning, we may well not recognize the new emerging world order. The fall of Fannie and Freddie has set in play falling dominoes whose ultimate pattern is still not clear. Will China pull back from supporting U.S. debt? Will others follow suit?</p>
<p>Some have argued that China simply cannot disengage; the price for them is too high.</p>
<p>To that I answer: The present arrangement cannot continue. It will and must change. We have been joined at the hip like Siamese twins: One falls; the other falls.</p>
<p>But doctors have been assembled, both at home and abroad. The delicate severing operation may be about to begin.</p>
<p>China will protect its interest. And is London Banker correct about whose interests in the states will be protected?</p>
<p>In every system there is a dynamic. Look closely at the gears and you will see its direction. Globalization as it has been structured has its dynamic as well. China as exporter and saver: America as consumer and debtor. There have been winners&#8211;and rest assured, they will do their best to protect their gains.</p>
<p>We, we the bit players, are like Rosencrantz and Guildenstern in Tom Stoppard&#8217;s marvelous play. Around us move the great ones, making plans we cannot see, arranging the world according to their needs. They tell us all is well, proceeding as planned. A glorious future awaits us; we simply have to obey directives. Like blind pawns, we are moved around the board.</p>
<p>Well, I for one, am not convinced all this will end happily&#8230;at least not for us.</p>
