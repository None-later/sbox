                                <p>I like Brad DeLong, conceptually.  Even his <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/more-lies-from.html">errors in judgment</a> are based on rational principles.  And he has a really useful piece up right now about &#8220;<a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/understanding-t.html">dealing with financial crises</a>.&#8221;  (One of the nice things about it is that it also completely undermines <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/another-judgmen.html">his earlier suggestion</a> that the Fed was wrong not to ease on Tuesday.  As <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/09/fed-leaves-inte.html">Mark Thoma</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/perception-v-reality.html">I</a>, among others, suggested, they clearly knew it would do no good, and &#8220;saved their powder&#8221; accordingly.)</p>
<p>There are only a few problems, key of which is the title of this piece.  Derivatives may have a value, but are they actually assets?  Worse, if the Fed buys an asset, does it also have to buy all of the associated derivative contracts, one side of which may—by that simple—become worthless or become payable?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not suggesting that Helicopter Henry and Biplane Ben&#8217;s $100B <s>inflation</s> solution isn&#8217;t going to work,* but if you&#8217;re trying to <em>limit</em> contagion, you generally don&#8217;t start by infecting healthy entities.</p>
<p>Of course, that assumes the entities are healthy. The <a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2008/09/19/details_on_the.html">commenters at Infectious Greed</a> have gotten more astute as the day goes by:<br />
<blockquote>AIG, Leucadia, Loews, Berkshire Bancorp and Berkshire Hills Bancorp (gotta protect the high ground!) but not Berkshire Hathaway, AmEx or Capital One. Also Affiliated Managers Group and Pzena but not Legg Mason. Fascinating; like a train wreck in progress.</p></blockquote>
<p>and<br />
<blockquote>That &#8220;do not short&#8221; list is basically the list of companies you must to sell if you have any of them in your portfolio.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or, as an old friend just e-mailed me, &#8220;So.  I see there&#8217;s a list of 799 financial forms that cannot be shorted&#8230;.that is by no means all the financials in the US market&#8230;is there any reason at all that we shouldn&#8217;t take this as a list of financial companies KNOWN TO BE UNSOUND?&#8221;</p>
<p>So maybe I shouldn&#8217;t be worrying so much about possible contagions.</p>
<p>DeLong rather cavalierly, though, throws out a straw man to reject it:<br />
<blockquote>Fourth, there is now no time for tolerance of the three objections to this analysis and this plan of action, roughly: (1) it&#8217;s immoral, (2) it&#8217;s unfair, and (3) it can&#8217;t work in the long run. To expand a bit:</p>
<p>   1. It&#8217;s immoral because people have a right to be treated like adults&#8211;which means that they have a right not to be rescued by the government from the consequences of their bad judgment, and we are violating that right.<br />   2. It&#8217;s unfair because feckless greedy financiers who caused the problem ought to lose money and aren&#8217;t&#8211;or aren&#8217;t losing enough money&#8211;and because feckless greedy imprudent thriftless borrowers who caused the problem ought to lose money and aren&#8217;t&#8211;or aren&#8217;t losing enough money.<br />   3. It won&#8217;t work&#8211;at least not in the long run.[emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s ignore that, given that he dismisses (1) and (2), (3) becomes inevitable.  Let&#8217;s even grant (1)—while noting that he deliberately phrased to place it in the poorest light possible—since a bailout is necessary,** and targeted bailout isn&#8217;t going to work.***</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say #2 sticks in my craw a bit.  Especially if you&#8217;re making the absurd claim that there &#8220;is now no time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Helicopter Hank and Biplane Ben have had six months since The Old Firm went the way of all <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_personhood">Southern Pacific Railroads</a>.  During that time, they have created Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) like a derivatives shop on Gramm-crack.  They have red-socked**** us more times than we can count to provide <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/900-billion-for-you-citizennever.html">nearly a billion dollars worth</a> of liquidity so that those risky assets could be managed, marked appropriately, unwound, or sold.</p>
<p>And now they&#8217;re going to throw &#8220;hundreds of billions of dollars&#8221; more into the giant Money Pit that is ever-increasing its lending standards to companies that are far better run than they are.</p>
<p>And Brad DeLong has just declared that we shouldn&#8217;t hold anyone responsible; indeed, the Hank Greenbergs and Dick Fulds and Jimmy Effing Caynes of the world should continue to be rewarded by the U.S. taxpayer, because &#8220;there is no time.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, Brad, when you tell us that we don&#8217;t have the time to hold people responsible for their actions, and we tell you it won&#8217;t work in the long run, remember the reason we&#8217;re saying that.  Because, in pre-Paulson/Bernanke economic theory, actions used to have consequences.  Now, they can just cost the taxpayers.</p>
<p>And when I add that to your final graph—the one that is supposed to get us back to that &#8220;good equilibrium&#8221; point—I stop seeing it as an intertemporal equilibrium point and more as an outlier from the payoff-dominant strategies you are effectively advocating be concretized.</p>
<p>*It&#8217;s not the way to bet, but you go to war with the policies you have.<br />**Just as it was for Argentina in 2001 and&#8230;what&#8230;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Consensus">Washington Consensus</a>?  Sorry, no habla ingles.<br />***We shall ignore, since he does, that the reason targeted bailouts didn&#8217;t work is that companies smelled blood (money) in the water and decided to go for it, leaving us with Chris &#8220;<a href="http://dealbreaker.com/2008/09/sec-stocks-can-only-go-up.php">stocks can only go up</a>&#8221; Cox bending the U.S. taxpayer over a little more.<br />****Trust me, if you don&#8217;t know this phrase, you do <strong>not</strong> want to look it up.  Assume from context.</p>

<blockquote>Watching John McCain&#8217;s  economics speech in Wisconsin. It&#8217;s like watching a modern day <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Hoover">Herbert Hoover</a> live. He  really doesn&#8217;t get it&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>&#8211; He went through a castigation of the Fed and basically told them to stay out  of this &#8211; I mean, does he really not understand that the Fed was designed to  regulate the financial markets? These investment and insurance companies, given  their enormous size, are effectively a part of the financial services system.  That was the rationale for <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/405796/nationalization">nationalizing</a>  them instead of letting them fail. The Fed has been doing exactly what they are  supposed to. Now the Treasury Department, that&#8217;s a different question &#8211; does  McCain know the difference? After years on the Commerce Committee one would  expect so, but maybe not.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Exaggeration?  This is the <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/News/Speeches/9a604256-0519-46e6-a1ce-e70798b39ec2.htm">text of the Green Bay speech</a> from the McCain website:<br />
<blockquote>Finally, the Federal Reserve should get back to its core business of responsibly managing our money supply and inflation. It needs to get out of the business of bailouts. The Fed needs to return to protecting the purchasing power of the dollar. A strong dollar will reduce energy and food prices. It will stimulate sustainable economic growth and get this economy moving again.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does McCain really think that the economy would be in better shape if Ben Bernanke and company hadn&#8217;t been trying everything in the books to counteract the crisis?  If so, on what basis?  Could he possibly have a clue as to, e.g., what happens to the money supply in a credit crunch?  Whether the Fed&#8217;s crisis management policies have constituted economic stimulus?  (This is not to say that Bernanke and the Fed are infallible by any stretch of the imagination, but as Brad DeLong suggests, we at least want them to avoid the known gross <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/396512969/is-2008-our-192.html">mistakes of the past</a>.)</p>
<p>What&#8217;s arguably worse is that this represents some form of his advisers&#8217; &#8220;wisdom.&#8221;  Which is to say, as a big picture matter neither McCain nor his economic advisers deserve to be let anywhere near the tiller of the metaphorical supertanker.</p>

<p>In Defense of Corporate Taxes</p>
<p>This may well have been the subject of a post by PGL. I apologize if I&#8217;m covering the same ground&#8230; my memory isn&#8217;t always the best.</p>
<p>Every so often, someone brings up the idea of eliminating corporate taxes. I haven’t heard it in a few months &#8211; no doubt we’re due for it. There are all kinds of justifications for it, but the big one seems to be: the individuals who own the corporation already pay taxes on it, so why should they be taxed twice – once when the corporation makes the profit, and once when it passes on the profits to the individual.</p>
<p>Except in special cases in which a corporation has only a handful of owners (and the accountants can correct me if I’m wrong), in which case the corporation is just a pass-through entity and only the owners pay taxes anyway, the corporation is a distinct legal entity. If you don’t believe me, see what happens if you try to withdraw cash from the bank account of a company in which you own shares of stock. </p>
<p>The fact that the corporation is a separate legal entity means that it has rights – including the right to keep your hands out of its bank account. Those rights are guaranteed by… the government. This is a service provided by… the government. It is separate from the services provided to the rest of us, guaranteeing our rights, for which the rest of us pay taxes. </p>
<p>People who argue that corporations should be exempt from taxes never seem to feel that corporations should be exempt from legal rights and guarantees which cost money to provide. Put another way, whether they realize it or not, they are arguing that corporations should be allowed to free ride upon the rest of us.</p>
<p>There an additional big problem that I can see with eliminating taxes on corporations…. how long would it take for the highest paid employees of any organization – namely those at the top, to cease being employees and become sub-contractors? Eliminating taxes on corporations would quickly make sure that Leona Helmsley’s world, in which only the little people pay taxes, would quickly come to pass. But I imagine for many that’s the point.</p>
<p>I’d like to wish a Happy New Year to my fellow Angry Bears, but I am especially grateful to the readers of this site for giving extending to us the privilege of reading what we write and for all the comments. I don’t use the word privilege lightly. Thank you, and may the next year be a successful one for you.</p>
<p>Update&#8230; I changed the first sentence in the last paragraph &#8211; as previously written, it was a bit ambiguous.</p>

<p>All the news on disappearing &#8216;equity&#8217; and dissolving networth brought to mind I should bring some good news from the US Air Force whittlin&#8217; scene to Angry Bear readers.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago Boeing told the Air Force that they would not compete against the monster Airbus with their KC 135 replacement Boeing 767 because they would need a year or so to develop a Boeing 777 or 747 proposal.  In effect Boeing said:  if you want to replace the underused KC-10 fleet instead of replacing the workhorse, 500 airplane KC 135 fleet we need enough time to send in a proposal for a tanker version of one of our (Boeing) much too big airplanes.</p>
<p>Boeing should have publicized (outside the defense trades) the time and effort already spent on certifying the KC 767 to fly in commercial airspace, which is years ahead of the Northrop Airbus candidate which Northrop sold as coming online in 18 months after award.  No one picked up that the Air Force was engaged in buying the aerospace version of French CDO&#8217;s.</p>
<p>DoD was caught buying a different airplane than specified and one that is not needed, that Boeing showed this and that GAO agreed shows that something is going right inside the Beltway.  Good news!</p>
<p>Good thing because when all the socialisation of risk in the financials is paid for there won&#8217;t be enough money left in the kids&#8217; earning power to do whittlin like has been done the past 7 years.</p>
<p>I am thinking I won&#8217;t have much to write in the next few years. </p>
<p>Air Force decided to suspend the contracting plan for the replacement tanker until the next administration comes on board.  In essence the thing is cancelled.  Right on!</p>
<p>An end to some whittlin&#8217;?<br />__________________________<br />by ilsm</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aFsdjjZ3hSec&#038;refer=home">Documentation of a minor disruption</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Lehman won&#8217;t return &#8220;billions&#8221; of frozen prime-brokerage assets &#8220;in the short term,&#8221; said PricewaterhouseCoopers, administrator for the Lehman bankruptcy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, several hedge funds are planning to sing the Bono phrase from &#8220;Do They Know It&#8217;s Xmastime?&#8221;* to their cohorts at Morgan Stanley:<br />
<blockquote>Hedge funds that account for less than 10 percent of Morgan Stanley&#8217;s prime-brokerage balances this week withdrew their money or told the firm they planned to, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the really good news:<br />
<blockquote>The loss of all hedge-fund accounts wouldn&#8217;t materially affect the company&#8217;s access to reserves, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the information is confidential.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not certain I would take that as encouraging.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Hedge funds tend to look at counterparty risk as they would an equity investment,&#8221; said Adam Sussman, director of research at TABB Group LLC, a New York-based adviser to financial-services companies. &#8220;If they&#8217;d bet against the stock, they&#8217;d also be likely to minimize their exposure to their prime brokerage and trading over-the-counter derivatives with them.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe Bloomberg just indicated that the hedge funds leaving Morgan Stanley are &#8220;voting with their feet.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Foremost on people&#8217;s minds is ensuring that wherever they decide to put assets, they will be secure,&#8221; [BNP Paribas SA&#8217;s global head of hedge-fund relationships, Talbot Stark] said in an interview today.</p></blockquote>
<p>With <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/flight-to-quality/">Treasuries yielding 0.00%</a>—about the same as your mattress, except with no option value—&#8221;security&#8221; has become more important than (to borrow an old phrase from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankers_Trust">a deceased-but-no-longer-mourned firm</a>) Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital (RAROC).</p>
<p>And it appears that the Wizard of Id&#8217;s version of the Golden Rule** <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080918/wall_street.html">still applies</a>.  Even if it <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/how-wall-streets-quants-lied-to-their-computers/">really was their fault</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The people who ran the financial firms chose to program their risk-management systems with overly optimistic assumptions and to feed them oversimplified data. This kept them from sounding the alarm early enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe more on this later.</p>
<p>*&#8221;Well tonight thank G-d it&#8217;s them/Instead of you&#8221;<br />**&#8221;He who has the gold makes the rules&#8221;</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As the world financial markets head into complete meltdown, it is worth taking a moment to look back to see where much of this began. A significant portion of the current crisis stems from the shadow banking system’s dependence upon the explosive growth in derivatives market. Put simply, these complex financial instruments are meant to monetize risk of default. Futures contracts, options, swaps, and many others allow one party to insure money is exchanged, but the outcome of the contract depend upon many underlying factors that make up the terms of the contract. Though many forms of derivatives are traded in exchanges, many are not necessarily.</p>
<p>Derivatives that not necessarily traded on market floors are known as “over-the-counter” derivatives. They are usually bilateral contracts between investment banks and a customer and can be generated simply over the phone or over the internet. This form of contracting is largely unregulated. The OTC market has been monitored by the Bank for International Settlements since at 1998, and they publish detailed information on various forms of OTC derivatives every six months. The most recent data can be found <a href="http://www.bis.org/statistics/derdetailed.htm">here</a>.</p>
<p>This market was very big in 1998, but it has exploded since then. I’ve generated a figure of the amounts outstanding of OTC derivatives since 1998 broken down into their various types.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SNJqgUFUXII/AAAAAAAAALQ/1-lyCN7hhcU/s1600-h/total_OTC.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SNJqgUFUXII/AAAAAAAAALQ/1-lyCN7hhcU/s400/total_OTC.JPG" alt="" border="0"></a><br />You should note that the Y-axis is in billions of dollars. Yes, billions. That means, as of Dec 2007 (for which BIS has the most recent data), the total OTC derivative market was almost $600 trillion. With a T. Thus, in 10 years it has gown 826%.</p>
<p>The growth is even more shocking if you look at some of the subcategories of OTC derivatives. Below is a figure illustrating the percentage of amount of outstanding contracts relative to the amount outstanding in June 1998 for interest rate contracts, commodity contracts, and credit default swaps.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SNJqnQTgotI/AAAAAAAAALY/3Sa7TNrdk1A/s1600-h/comm_CDS_interest.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_JY-rIL8plNM/SNJqnQTgotI/AAAAAAAAALY/3Sa7TNrdk1A/s400/comm_CDS_interest.JPG" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Though commodity contracts still make up only a small proportion of the total OTC contracts outstanding (1.5%), its growth has been astronomical, increasing over 2,000% since June of 1998. Even interest rate contracts, which make up the largest portion (66%) of all OTC derivatives, increased over 900% in 10 years. And most troubling of all is the credit default swap market. These are contracts that are activated in the event of a default.<br />This market has increased 905% in just three and a half years since BIS starting monitoring this form of derivative. It was a mere $6.4 trillion in Dec 2004; In Dec of 2007 this market ballooned to $57.9 trillion. Just think of the unwinding of credit default swaps that is involved when big investment banks like Lehman Bros. go under.</p>
<p>Of course, all of it is very complicated, because derivatives are essentially a “zero-sum” instrument. The way derivatives are supposed to function is that money is exchanged depending on the outcome. Nothing is lost, at least in an ideal environment; it is only exchanged hands. One side wins, the other looses. So it isn&#8217;t exactly clear what will happen as these contracts are unwound. But what happens when one party of the contract can’t pay?</p>
<p>I think we’re going to see that many times over very soon…</p>
<p>UPDATE: Be sure to read <a href="http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/18/diamond-and-kashyap-on-the-recent-financial-upheavals/">this excellent piece</a> from the Freakonomics blog explaining the current crisis and the roles of the major players as it stands right now (H/T <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/3315013635937196179/?a=47620#720916">Bear</a>). They mention that one of the major reasons that AIG was saved was their heavy dependence upon CDSs, $57 billion worth, according to the post. That is exactly 0.1% of the outstanding CDSs according to BIS statistics as of Dec 2007. I&#8217;m sure the other 99.9% is perfectly fine&#8230;</p>

Enjoy!<br />Since Monday the McCain camp has stepped up its personal attacks against Alaskans. They’ve continued their D.C.-style tactics against neighbors in this small state. The game plan is to find an excuse to stop our Legislature’s Troopergate investigation, and hide evidence McCain’s folks really don’t want to surface before November’s election. It’s been a little Karl Rove, and parts Laurel and Hardy. How else can you explain the following?</p></blockquote>
<p>Rdan here&#8230;Instead of interpreting or spotlight sections of Les Gara&#8217;s article in Mudflats, the rest follows under the fold.  It speaks for itself eloquently.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Last week the Attorney general’s office promised state witnesses would comply with subpoenas the Legislature issued last week. Tuesday the Governor’s Attorney General flip flopped, and announced that state witnesses wouldn’t comply because, well, and I’m paraphrasing here &#8211; he’s changed his mind. And in what has to be an idea hatched after a 4th Martini at Chilkoot Charlie’s, Governor Palin’s attorneys have filed a motion to dismiss the ethics claim she filed against herself two weeks ago. Yup. She really filed a complaint against herself. Tuesday she said she’s discovered, after a thorough investigation of herself, that she’s done nothing wrong. Does anyone know how to get a hold of Jon Stewart and Tina Fey?<br />It’s silly season up here in the far north, but this week’s moves are aimed at one thing: John McCain’s effort to find cover for being disingenuous. See, before Governor Palin’s nomination for the Republican VP spot, she did the honest thing. She admitted the evidence &#8211; of roughly 20 contacts between her staff and husband with Public Safety officials, seeking the firing of Governor Palin’s former brother-in-law &#8211; might lead a reasonable person to the conclusion that the she misused her office to fire a state employee. So when Alaska’s Republican-led Legislature called for an investigation, she did the honorable thing and said she and her staff would comply. She denies any wrongdoing.<br />Things changed on August 29 when Governor Palin was added to the McCain ticket. Since then his handlers have told her she can’t testify. They don’t want the evidence in this case to come out. They don’t want her to testify under oath. They don’t want other witnesses to testify under oath. So they have engaged in daily maneuvers to attack, as disloyal to the McCain campaign, anyone who wants the investigation to move forward. They’ve now attacked two well respected prosecutors, and perhaps the state’s most highly regarded law enforcement official &#8211; the Public Safety Commissioner she hired, and then fired, Walt Monegan.<br />Every day this week McCain operatives have sung the same tune. Today a guy with an East Coast accent, who knows nothing about Alaska, stood in front of a McCain-Palin banner to lead the attacks against people he doesn’t know. At press conferences on Monday and Tuesday campaign staffer Megan Stapleton spit vitriol to repeat her argument that this investigation is really a “Democratic” attack on Governor Palin.<br />See, that’s easier than just saying their VP has reneged on her promise to testify. It’s easier than just saying they don’t want anyone testifying before the November election. It’s easier than admitting they are stonewalling a legislative investigation.<br />Here are a few things they failed to say. There are a few small facts that make it hard to style this as a Democratic investigation. One is that Alaska is a Republican State. We have a Republican Governor and a Legislature of 34 Republicans and 26 Democrats. This summer the Legislature’s Legislative Council voted 12-0 (8 Republicans and 4 Democrats) to hire an investigator, and appointed Democratic Senator Hollis French, a well-respected former prosecutor, to find an investigator. Governor Palin stated she and her employees would comply with the investigation. French then hired Steve Branchflower, a former DA who most recently was hired by legislative Republicans to run the state’s Office of Victims rights. <br />And on Friday the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 3-2 (2 Democrats and 1 Republican in favor); and the House Judiciary Committee issued a 7 &#8211; 0 (5 Republicans, 2 Democrats) advisory vote, to issue subpoenas to witnesses the McCain camp had previously stopped from testifying.<br />Over the last two days McCain’s outside operatives have vilified former prosecutor Hollis French &#8211; as an Obama supporter who must have called this investigation to hurt the McCain ticket. But French was appointed to oversee the investigation by a 12 &#8211; 0 Legislative Council vote, and is probably the state’s most respected legislator &#8211; by Republicans and Democrats alike. He’s so popular the Republican Party couldn’t find anyone to run against him this year.<br />They’ve called former Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan &#8211; a Native Alaskan who has served Republican and Democratic Administrations with honor, and put his life on the line in uniform &#8211; “insubordinate.” Odd, given that when Governor Palin fired him she offered him a different job. I guess being “insubordinate” was a job requirement for the new position. And they’ve challenged the independence of an investigator and former DA, who has no animus anyone can find. <br />Those Swift boat ads taught the McCain folks that if you say something untrue enough times, it can stick.<br />My favorite moment of the week came when Governor Palin’s attorneys filed a motion to dismiss Palin’s ethics complaint against herself. Stay with me. Her attorneys have been buying the peyote, not me. See, on August 29 they needed to find a way to stop the Legislature’s investigation. They tried asking the Republican leaders to call it off, and take one for the team. But the Senate President and others honorably said no. So they came up with an argument that the State Personnel Board &#8211; 3 people appointed by Governor Palin and her Republican predecessor Frank Murkowski &#8211; had “exclusive jurisdiction” to investigate wrongdoing by the Governor. The Legislature wasn’t amused. So Governor Palin then filed a complaint against herself.<br />That, they said, put “jurisdiction” in the hands of their friends at the Personnel Board. They argued that since the Personnel Board was now proceeding with an “investigation”, the Legislature couldn’t. <br />To put icing on the cake, on Monday the Governor’s attorneys moved to dismiss the Governor’s case against herself. They said, and I loosely paraphrase again &#8211; that they tried really hard and just couldn’t find any evidence that the Governor did anything wrong. OK. I can’t believe I just wrote that. And I wish it weren’t true.<br />These are the things you have to do when your Presidential candidate doesn’t want his VP to honor a promise, and doesn’t want evidence to come out before an election. These are the things you have to do if your folks aren’t going to comply with a subpoena. That’s because without spin the headline might read: “McCain Interferes With Investigation Palin Agreed To.” How easy it is to re-write a headline. They learned that during the Swift boat campaign too.<br />All we can hope for is that members of the press will remember what they learned in journalism school. Not to repeat the spin of political operatives without reporting the truth. Not to write “he said she said” stories, and pretend the truth is somewhere in the middle. But to report the facts. No matter how you spin it, Governor Palin promised to comply with this Legislative Investigation. McCain’s folks got her to change her position. And the Legislature that voted for the investigation did so on a bi-partisan basis. End of story. End of headline.<br />Over the next few days McCain’s folks will try to get local legislators to step in line, out of party loyalty, and reverse their vote to investigate Troopergate. But many local Republicans, like Senate President Lyda Green, have so far refused to play those politics.<br />Stay for more from McCain’s Campaign for “Change.” They’ve tried to change the truth. They’ve succeeded at changing Governor Palin’s promise to comply with this investigation. Let’s see what they’ll change next.<br />Thanks for really being out there on the Mudflats, Les. Hey, if this ‘being a great politician’ thing doesn’t work out, you’re always welcome here.</p></blockquote>

<p>Reuters totaled up the cost of the bail-out so far, and their figure sits at <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/bondsNews/idUSN16126320080917">900 billion</a>.  Since GDP last quarter came in at <a href="http://bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">14 and a quarter trillion</a>, we&#8217;re talking about the federal government and the Federal Reserve putting up an amount equal to about 6.3% of the economy.  Sure, most of it is in the form of loans and financing and stuff, and its impossible to say how much of that total will be lost forever.  </p>
<p>As I write this, the Dow is now just about where it was when GW took office, 8 years ago.  And that&#8217;s nominal, not adjusted for inflation.  Put another way, money in the stock market lost money over the past eight years.  My wife and I took all of our money out of all the sectors that are in trouble today about a year ago, and yet our portfolio has taken one heck of a hit recently, so its not just a matter of picking what to avoid.  We avoided all the big losers, and still got hammered.</p>
<p>So if I may play a poor man&#8217;s  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/bruce-webb-on-social-security.html">Bruce Webb</a>, let me wonder about the following&#8230;  Say that the president and the cheerleaders, the folks who gave us this bail-out, had succeeded in privatizing Social Security back when he took office.  After eight years of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">pretty piddly growth</a> and a tanking stock market, a lot of people would find their retirement fund depleted, and folks dependent on that retirement fund would be in deep trouble.  I wonder &#8211; would GW and the cheerleaders, the folks who brought you a &#8220;bankruptcy reform&#8221; law written by the credit card companies, support having the government prop up millions of ordinary Americans, most of them retirees, to the tune of $900 billion over a period of a few weeks?  <br />_________________________________<br />by cactus</p>
