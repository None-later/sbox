                                <p>Could July have been the bottom in auto sales?</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SMKH8qhcwAI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/nJHmWhqFjEQ/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SMKH8qhcwAI/AAAAAAAAAZQ/nJHmWhqFjEQ/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Auto sales jumped from 12.6 million in July to 13.7 million in August.</p>
<p>Auto sales are nearly 20% below trend as compared to 30% below trend at the 1981 bottom and  16% below trend at the 1991 bottom.</p>
<p>So, just maybe July was the bottom.</p>

                                <p>When George W. Bush brags about: (1) increasing Federal funding of drugs and increasing defense spending; (2) giving us or money back in the form of a tax “cut” (actually deferral); and (3) reducing the deficit all at the same time, my reply is that he must be practicing some advanced level of fuzzy math.  McCain’s 2008 campaign is also based on this fuzzy math but <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/05/AR2008090503722.html?nav=rss_politics">Anne Kornblut</a> notes that McCain’s fuzzy math extends to Palin’s sale of her jet:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the most compelling anecdotes in Sarah Palin’s repertoire is that she auctioned off the Alaska governor&#8217;s jet on eBay after taking office &#8212; a swift move made by a reformer hoping to clean up the excesses of her predecessor. In fact, the jet did not sell on eBay. It was sold to a businessman from Valdez named Larry Reynolds, who paid $2.1 million for the plane &#8212; shy of the $2.7 million purchase price &#8212; according to news reports at the time. Reynolds contributed to Palin&#8217;s campaign in 2006. What happened? It appears that, as she promised during her bid for governor, Palin did try to sell the plane on eBay, but there was only one serious bid, in December of 2006, and it fell through. The Westwind II was sold about eight months later, achieving her goal of ridding the state of a luxury item. But that hasn&#8217;t stopped Palin, or John McCain, from implying &#8212; or asserting outright &#8212; that Palin sold the jet on the Internet. &#8220;You know what I enjoyed the most? She took the luxury jet that was acquired by her predecessor, and sold it on eBay &#8212; and made a profit!&#8221; McCain declared in Wisconsin at a campaign stop Friday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Kornblut suggests Palin had a loss equal to $0.6 million so how does McCain think she made a profit?  Oh wait a second – Reynolds also contributed money to Palin’s campaign.  Is McCain saying there was some side deal between the Governor of Alaska and this Valdez businessman?  I think Team McCain has some explaining to do here.</p>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/214198.php">Will Thomas</a> who also notes that whether this was sold on eBay is “nitpicking” but McCain should be more careful with what he says.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/09/rising_unemploy.html">James Hamilton</a> has a nice post noting why he would say we are in a recession and linking to a lot of very smart economists who are saying the same thing.  All of these economists pay tribute to the tough task faced by the NBER Business-Cycle Dating Committee which has not officially declared that we are in a recession – at least not yet.  But I suspect Teams McCain and Obama will both start talking about fiscal policy cures for the rise in the unemployment rate – or the drop in the employment-population ratio if you prefer.  </p>
<p>I haven’t seen anything recent from Lawrence Summers on this but let me speculate what he might say – as I think he often gets these things quite right.  Summers strikes me as a long-term deficit hawk for the same pro-growth reasons that I am.  Something to do with increasing national savings – which of course the Reagan-Bush43-McCain wing of the Republican Party seems to think has it all backwards.  We deficit hawks tend to favor countercyclical monetary policy that lowers interest rates to encourage investment (and yes net exports via dollar devaluation) when aggregate demand is weak.  But the Federal Reserve has played that lever and some of us are concerned that it alone will not be enough.  </p>
<p>So as the politicians want to pander to the public with promises of both more spending and tax cuts too, let’s try to figure out which set of fiscal policies can do the best job of giving timely, targeted, and effective short-term fiscal stimulus and at the same time tell Wall Street that we are serious about long-term fiscal responsibility.  This policy prescription used to be called Rubinomics and I submit that it worked well for the Clinton Administration.  But then Summers was one of his excellent economic advisors – to which President Clinton did listen to carefully.  </p>
<p>McCain wants tax cuts – lots of them.  Some of them are temporary tax cuts (gasoline tax rebates) which a lot of economists would argue have little bang for the back.  But McCain is also advocating making George W. Bush’s tax cuts permanent.  Whoops – that’s the complete opposite of what Rubinomics would call for.  It would reduce national savings and long-term economic growth and could even hurt forward looking investors types such as those folks on Wall Street.  The McCain recipe is a lot like the Reagan and Bush43 recipes and the evidence is that these recipes work poorly.</p>
<p>Obama is calling for an acceleration of public investment projects, which could give a large bang for the buck and perhaps more timely bang for the buck.  But I’m not ready to say President Obama would be a repeat of what President Clinton did back in 1993.  Candidate Obama wants to tell all but the very rich they get a tax cut.  Then again candidate Clinton made that promise back in 1992.  But at least candidate Obama is proposing less fiscal irresponsibility than candidate McCain and is willing to say some folks will have to pay more in taxes.  Candidate Obama is also surrounding himself with economic advisors who are actual economists.  McCain’s idea for economic advisors include Carly Fiorina and Phil Gramm.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>As I watched the GOP convention talk about personalities rather than policies – and of course there was their air that McCain is someone morally superior to Obama for some odd reason – a set of thoughts kept filtering up but the words failed me – until I read what <a href="http://tpmelectioncentral.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/09/a_word_on_mccains_heroism_and.php">Greg Sargent</a> said so well:</p>
<blockquote><p>But why do we have to accept the idea that he&#8217;s also modest and reticent to discuss his own suffering? Why do we have to grant both his heroism and the superior character underlying his supposed reluctance to discuss the experiences that he just talked about in front of a TV audience of millions?</p>
<p>The McCain campaign and the GOP want this campaign to be about one thing: The compared character and experience of the two men running. But elections are also about another niggling detail: What each one is promising to do as president &#8212; that is, their promised agenda and proposed policies.</p>
<p>McCain says he&#8217;ll do some stuff. Obama says he&#8217;ll do other stuff. Polls show overwhelmingly that the American people back the program that Obama is promising. Shows like the one you watched tonight are designed to make you forget this. <br />McCain is offering his character &#8212; hardened by extraordinary suffering &#8212; but is also promising to put that character in service of accomplishing&#8230;very little different than what we&#8217;ve had at the hands of his predecessor.</p>
<p>Obama, too, is offering his biography. And his experiences, while not as overtly dramatic, nonetheless do have resonance for millions and millions of Americans. We&#8217;re supposed to see his experiences as less heroic than his opponent&#8217;s, and that&#8217;s fine &#8212; Obama hasn&#8217;t passed through the same fires McCain has &#8212; but Obama&#8217;s experiences carry weight and resonance for huge chunks of the population.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, the choice isn&#8217;t only between two biographies. It&#8217;s also between a set of promises and aspirations. Obama is offering a series of policy changes &#8212; pulling out of Iraq; changing America&#8217;s posture towards the rest of the world; changing the way foreign policy is discussed in this country; overhauling the tax code; engaging in genuine energy reform &#8212; that McCain isn&#8217;t offering.  Obama may or may not be able to deliver on these promises. But at least he&#8217;s promising to attempt them.</p>
<p>Shows like tonight&#8217;s are meant to persuade you that the election isn&#8217;t about such choices. Instead, you&#8217;re supposed to imagine that the election is a choice between two stories. Between two protagonists. That&#8217;s not what it&#8217;s about at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>We got more really bad news from the labor front.  So how would each candidate address this macroeconomic issue?  Oh yea – McCain sees it as an excuse for more and permanent tax cuts for the rich.  The one he had the good sense to vote against in 2001 did not do so well but now he wants more of the same.</p>

                                <p>Steve Waldman graduated Columbia the year after Barack Obama. His brother Mike was Bill Clinton&#8217;s chief speechwriter.  So when Steve Waldman declared his suspicion that John McCain would get <a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/stevenwaldman/2008/08/jewish-hostility-to-obama.html">the highest percentage of the Jewish vote of any recent Republican,</a> with a link that indicated it <a href="http://www.forward.com/blogs/campaign-confidential/14073/">could put Florida solidly in the Republican column</a>,  I took him seriously.*</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://mystical-politics.blogspot.com/2008/09/jews-for-jesus-speech-at-palins-church.html">Gary Farber&#8217;s ex-girl friend</a>,** I see the Sarah Palin nomination <a href="http://blog.beliefnet.com/stevenwaldman/2008/09/palin-the-jewish-vote.html">has caused him to recant this</a>, reasoning (correctly, one suspects) that Jews prefer to vote for people they don&#8217;t trust instead of people who want them killed:<br />
<blockquote>When Isaac was in Jerusalem he was there to witness some of that judgment, some of that conflict, when a Palestinian from East Jerusalem took a bulldozer and went plowing through a score of cars, killing numbers of people. Judgment&#8211;you can&#8217;t miss it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or who refer to your most Orthodox members as &#8220;butchers.&#8221;***<br />
<blockquote>Then I noticed, right out of the corner of my eye, five yeshiva bu[t]chers. Now, that&#8217;s the ultra-orthodox young seminary students. Maybe you&#8217;ve seen the pictures, you know, with the black hats and the black coats, and the side curls, you know. And they were walking towards us with a look of grim determination on their faces, and I knew we were in trouble&#8230;.And I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;, &#8220;That&#8217;s it. We&#8217;re gonna get martyred right here on the streets of Jerusalem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And who then reiterate that you are not the Chosen People until you are Christian:<br />
<blockquote>Our Father in heaven,</p>
<p>We stand before You as a people who&#8217;ve experienced Your grace, and we acknowledge that that grace was first extended to our people through Your people, the Jews; that there is not a one here in this room who would know Jesus and serve Him if there had not been a Jew, generations ago, that spoke Jesus&#8217; name to our people. Father, that comes full circle and we wish to extend Your grace back to Your people. And we pray and we ask that as a result of this time here, and as a result of this offering, there will be people among the Jews today who come to say the name &#8220;Jesus&#8221; with faith.</p>
<p>In His glorious name we pray, amen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now Steve Waldman may be—probably is—correct when he says &#8220;the <em>standard</em> preaching of many evangelical churches will be frightening to some Jews, just as the standard preaching of many African American churches were scary to whites.&#8221; And when he quotes Sarah Palin&#8217;s pastor saying, &#8220;You either receive the King that God has appointed for all mankind or you reject Him. There&#8217;s no neutral ground on that—none,&#8221; he clearly takes that as scary rhetoric.</p>
<p>But there is a difference between scary, &#8220;yeah us!&#8221; rhetoric, and being openly declared second-class citizens, or outright described as &#8220;butchers.&#8221;  Or, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/i-am-confused.html">as Brad DeLong so aptly put it</a>:<br />
<blockquote>John McCain wants to nominate his friend Joe Lieberman for vice president, is told that he cannot, and so he backs down and instead nominates somebody who takes their children to a church where they teach that suicide bombers in Tel Aviv are righteously executing God&#8217;s vengeance on Israel for rejecting Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote>
<p>*That several people in private conversation have suggested doubts about Obama from a Jewish perspective supports the premise.</p>
<p>**Among other things.  She&#8217;s also a long-time friend of my wife&#8217;s.</p>
<p>***Waldman posts the transcript as &#8220;buchers,&#8221; but <em>bucher</em> is Hebrew for &#8220;bookstores,&#8221; and it seems more probable, in the context, that this is a typo.</p>

<blockquote><p>The unemployment rate rose from 5.7 to 6.1 percent in August, and non-farm payroll employment continued to trend down (-84,000)</p></blockquote>
<p>The household survey indicated a 342,000 decline in employment, which led to:</p>
<blockquote><p>The employment-population ratio fell over the month to 62.1 percent in August, down 1.3 percentage points from its most recent high of 63.4 percent in December 2006.</p></blockquote>
<p>This 62.1 percent employment-population ratio for August compares to a 62.4 percent ratio for July and explains the jump in the unemployment rate since the labor force participation rate was unchanged.  It also represents the lowest level since September 2003.</p>
<p>Even before this bad news, <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2008/09/employment-watc.html">David Altig</a> was presenting employment data that would suggest we are in a recession.  As <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/employment-report.html">Spencer</a> notes – Team McCain is shying away from this issue.</p>
<p>Update: pgl&#8230;&#8221; Well we must have a lot of traffic with the number of comments here approaching 90 but it&#8217;s odd that none of them address the employment report for August, which was what this post was about&#8221;</p>
<p>(rdan here&#8230;.sorry to grab the post pgl, but something is going on that is very different, and will stop.  The currents of irrelevant comments is across the spectrum it would seem, with the &#8216;lefties&#8217; starting this one.  Except gang members have no political cover and will simply be considered threadbreakers.  If anyone on either side of the divide respects Angry Bear, please just duck the off topics.  Order gets restored this weekend.)</p>
<p>(Open thread is cancelled today because I will not waste a Friday evening monitoring food fights.  Since this is a group practice we will take a day or two and solve the problem.  To regular readers my apologies&#8230;the format will work, just growing pains from attentive desparadoes)</p>

<p>Alice in Co-payland</p>
<p>Now and then some tiny little headline, like this from the Orlando<br />Business Journal, catches my eye and gives me that old Alice in<br />Wonderland feeling.  Have a quick look:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/stories/2008/09/01/daily26.html">Biz journal</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>Survey: Most companies will increase health care costs<br />Orlando Business Journal</p>
<p>Fifty-nine percent of companies intend to keep down rising health care<br />costs in 2009 by raising workers&#8217; deductibles, copays or out-of-pocket<br />spending limits, according to a survey by the Mercer consulting firm.</p>
<p>On average, health care costs will rise by an estimated 5.7 percent<br />next year for both workers and their employers. That is equal to this<br />year&#8217;s increase and a 6.1 percent hike in 2007. ..</p></blockquote>
<p>This only looked weird to me because I live in Canada.  So if you didn&#8217;t<br />see what I saw, let me remind you they aren&#8217;t keeping down health<br />care costs &#8212; they&#8217;re shifting a chunk of the cost to employees<br />(those deductables and co-pays) in order to keep down the cost of<br />health insurance.  Insurance agents are not allowed to practice<br />medicine, I am sure.</p>
<p>And oh, for added funniness, this was just below the story online:</p>
<blockquote><p>Related News:</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Does <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/cvn_mccain">Liz Sidoti</a> know John McCain lied here?</p>
<blockquote><p>For all his talk of reaching across the aisle, McCain got in his jabs at Obama. After all, there are only two months until Election Day. He said Obama would raise taxes, close markets, increase government spending, eliminate jobs. He criticized Obama on energy, health care, and education policies.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=ap_praises_mccain_speech_that">Dean Baker</a> recognized the lies:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senator McCain claimed that Obama&#8217;s proposal would force people into a health care plan run by government bureaucrats. This is not true. Senator Obama&#8217;s plan would give people the option of buying into a publicly run Medicare-type plan, but this would only be an option. Under Senator Obama&#8217;s plan, no one would be forced to join the public plan, they would be free to stay with their current plan if they chose.  Senator McCain also misrepresented his plan on taxes for ordinary people. He claimed that he would not raise taxes, but his health care plan would raise taxes for tens of millions of middle income workers. McCain proposes making employer payments for health care taxable income. This will be a substantial tax increase for many workers. It also would have been appropriate to note this misrepresentation since Senator McCain has made low taxes so central to his campaign.  As a rule AP is not hesitant to criticize presidential acceptance speeches. The headline for its article on Senator Obama&#8217;s speech was &#8220;Obama Spares Details: Keeps Up Attacks.&#8221; It is worth noting that most other news accounts seem to have ignored Senator McCain&#8217;s misrepresentation of Obama&#8217;s position on this important issue.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the 2000 campaign, George W. Bush told a lot of lies and the press failed to note how dishonest his campaign was with respect to important policy issues such as government spending and taxes.  The result?  Bush became President.  The same playbook is in force during this election and it seems our press is still incapable of calling dishonesty when they see it.</p>
