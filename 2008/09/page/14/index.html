                                <p>I&#8217;m on vacation, but had time to notice with all that is going on in the financial markets nobody noticed that industrial production fell 1.1% in August.  Moreover, the June and July data were revised down.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SM6B9OT_T9I/AAAAAAAAAZY/B_zh_R-g-lo/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SM6B9OT_T9I/AAAAAAAAAZY/B_zh_R-g-lo/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>This is another observation supporting the analysis that third quarter real GDP growth will be very weak and maybe even negative even though we have no trade data yet.  But with real personal consumption expenditures down in June and nominal retail sales down in July the third quarter is looking much weaker than the first half.</p>
<p>P.S.  I read several blogs reporting on gas shortages and price gouging, but Saturday as I drove from Atlanta to Charleston I  bought gas at $4.23.  What am I missing?</p>

                                <p>Kevin Drum asks</p>
<p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2008/09/economic_meltdown_update.html">But here&#8217;s a question for one of the serious econ-bloggers out there: Have lots of big non-U.S. banks collapsed? There was Northern Rock, but anyone else? Are any European financial systems in danger of meltdown? Why not?</a></p>
<p>I like to think of myself as a serious econ-blogger, but don&#8217;t claim the title when I am writing about banks.  We clearly have <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/roubinis-not-wrong-but.html">brilliant what&#8217;s wrong with the banks bloggers here</a>.<br />I live in Europe and I have a sense about why this doesn&#8217;t happen here.</p>
<p>First we have to distinguish the UK and Continental Europe as the UK is much more like the USA.  I will talk about Continental Europe (the easy part).</p>
<p>My thoughts, for what they are worth, after the jump.</p>
<p>Anyway serious bloggers on banking here are warmly invited to try to answer Drum&#8217;s question.</p>
<p>First the banks that are failing in the USA are investment banks not depository institutions.  They are less tightly regulated, that is, allowed to take more risks.  This is partly a relic of the Glass-Stegal act, which made it illegal for depository institutions to own stock.  It is possible to set up and investment bank anywhere (no laws against it) but few pop up naturally without the protection of such a law &#8212; bank deposits are an attractive form of debt as people accept very low returns on them and they are publicly insured (note UK exception above).  In particular in Continental Europe banks suck huge amounts of money out of checking and savings accounts for fees for everything and pay very low interest (my expertise is in being irritated by my bank).  The commercial banking sector in Europe is much less competitive than in the US or UK.  Now with European unification this might change and then there might be bankruptcies, but up until now, Continental European banks have cash cows which can keep them solvent when they make huge errors playing the market (as they do).  The gap between the deposit rate (paid by banks) and the mortgage interest rate is tiny in the USA compared to most countries, so banks don&#8217;t have huge average flows of cash to keep them solvent.</p>
<p>Second, the sort of private bailout (Bailin in Roubini&#8217;s terms) that failed this weekend would have worked on the Continent.   If the minister of the treasury or the president of the central bank asks big banks to take some losses for the good of the financial system they will.  This is because good relations with the state are very valuable.  What they get in return is not glaringly obvious every day, but it is worth it.  For example, nothing is done about the lack of competition.</p>
<p>Third, aside from that, giving public money to companies at risk of bankruptcy and maximizing moral hazard is a long Continental European tradition.  EU rules make it much more difficult now, but for decades, companies in Europe didn&#8217;t dramatically fail, because the treasuries bailed them out without humiliating them by making it clear what was going on.</p>
<p>Fourth, fierce competition among commercial banks and non-bank mortgage companies and such has implied that they loan to individuals who are not very credit worthy.  This means that ordinary Americans are incredibly indebted (see Mooser&#8217;s comment stolen by me and linked by Rdan below).  This is a root cause of the problem.</p>
<p>Fifth, US banks have designed incentive systems which make it rational for bankers to do things that will occasionally cause a crisis.  Bankers and traders are rewarded for performance.  This, in practice, means they are rewarded for taking risks as if the bet wins, they share the winnings, but if they lose big the worst thing that can be done to them is to fire them.  In particular a collapse of the system can&#8217;t be blamed on any one person, so almost no one pays.  That is it is OK to lose when everyone is losing, because not everyone can be fired.  </p>
<blockquote><p>A &#8216;sound&#8217; banker, alas! is not one who foresees danger and avoids it, but one who, when he is ruined, is ruined in a conventional and orthodox way along with his fellows, so that no one can really blame him.</p></blockquote>
<p>—Keynes</p>
<p>Of course, if you ask Keynes, he would say it is obviously because Americans are just stupid and inferior.  He was wrong about that, but had a point about bankers.</p>

<p>When Bush was elected, we paid off the house and took our money out of investments and into insured accounts. I advise others not to do the same. When you have no house payment, you feel like you are living in somebody else&#8217;s house. It&#8217;s a very anxious feeling, and it&#8217;s putting a strain on my marriage. In addition, there is no shorter path to ostracism in the workplace than carrying no (or very little) debt. I&#8217;ve got nothing to talk about with co-workers, and they suspect I have ties with affluent and generous terrorists. </p>

                                <p>Hat tip to vtcodger for this catch:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/09/central-banks-anticipate-mother-of-year.html">Naked Capitalism</a> makes a comment and uses Bloomberg:</p>
<blockquote><p>We noted a few weeks ago that between large amounts of short term financial firm debt maturing in the third and fourth quarters, banks still leery of lending to each other, and liquidity always lower at year end (banks pull back from the market to square off their books), this November-Decemeber looks to be even worse than last year, which was bad enough to lead to emergency intervention.</p>
<p>From Bloomberg:</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve may have to increase the cash it provides to banks and brokers, already a record, to help them balance their books at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Six bank failures in the past two months and rising concern about Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.&#8217;s capital levels pushed lenders&#8217; borrowing costs to near a four-month high yesterday. They may climb further as companies rush for cash to settle trades and buttress their balance sheets at year-end.</p>
<p>&#8220;This could be the mother of year-ends,&#8221; said Brian Sack, vice president of Macroeconomic Advisers LLC in Washington, who used to serve as head of monetary and financial market analysis at the Fed. &#8220;The markets will need extraordinary actions to get through it.&#8221;</p>
<p>One option is for banks and brokers to increase the loans they take out directly with the Fed; the central bank reports on the figures today. Officials could also offer options on its biweekly loan auctions or introduce special repurchase agreements to straddle the end of the year, economists said.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Editor&#8217;s Note: Historically a John McCain supporter, conservative journalist and blogger Andrew Sullivan takes on the issue of John McCain&#8217;s integrity as he strives to win the presidency. &#8211; vh/TO </p>
<p>    For me, this surreal moment &#8211; like the entire surrealism of the past ten days &#8211; is not really about Sarah Palin or Barack Obama or pigs or fish or lipstick. It&#8217;s about John McCain. The one thing I always thought I knew about him is that he is a decent and honest person. When he knows, as every sane person must, that Obama did not in any conceivable sense mean that Sarah Palin is a pig, what did he do? Did he come out and say so and end this charade? Or did he acquiesce in and thereby enable the mindless Rovianism that is now the core feature of his campaign? </p>
<p>    So far, he has let us all down. My guess is he will continue to do so. And that decision, for my part, ends whatever respect I once had for him. On core moral issues, where this man knew what the right thing was, and had to pick between good and evil, he chose evil. When he knew that George W. Bush&#8217;s war in Iraq was a fiasco and catastrophe, and before Donald Rumsfeld quit, McCain endorsed George W. Bush against his fellow Vietnam vet, John Kerry in 2004. By that decision, McCain lost any credibility that he can ever put country first. He put party first and his own career first ahead of what he knew was best for the country. </p>
<p>    And when the Senate and House voted overwhelmingly to condemn and end the torture regime of Bush and Cheney in 2006, McCain again had a clear choice between good and evil, and chose evil. </p>
<p>    He capitulated and enshrined torture as the policy of the United States, by allowing the CIA to use techniques as bad as and worse than the torture inflicted on him in Vietnam. He gave the war criminals in the White House retroactive immunity against the prosecution they so richly deserve. The enormity of this moral betrayal, this betrayal of his country&#8217;s honor, has yet to sink in. But for my part, it now makes much more sense. He is not the man I thought he was. </p>
<p>    And when he had the chance to engage in a real and substantive debate against the most talented politician of the next generation in a fall campaign where vital issues are at stake, what did McCain do? He began his general campaign with a series of grotesque, trivial and absurd MTV-style attacks on Obama&#8217;s virtues and implied disgusting things about his opponent&#8217;s patriotism. </p>
<p>    And then, because he could see he was going to lose, ten days ago, he threw caution to the wind and with no vetting whatsoever, picked a woman who, by her decision to endure her own eight-month pregnancy of a Down Syndrome child in public, that he was going to reignite the culture war as a last stand against Obama. That&#8217;s all that is happening right now: a massive bump in the enthusiasm of the Christianist base. This is pure Rove. </p>
<p>    Yes, McCain made a decision that revealed many appalling things about him. In the end, his final concern is not national security. No one who cares about national security would pick as vice-president someone who knows nothing about it as his replacement. No one who cares about this country&#8217;s safety would gamble the security of the world on a total unknown because she polled well with the Christianist base. No person who truly believed that the surge was integral to this country&#8217;s national security would pick as his veep candidate a woman who, so far as we can tell anything, opposed it at the time. </p>
<p>    McCain has demonstrated in the last two months that he does not have the character to be president of the United States. And that is why it is more important than ever to ensure that Barack Obama is the next president. The alternative is now unthinkable. And McCain &#8211; no one else &#8211; has proved it.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Quit Doling Out That Bad-Economy Line</p>
<p><a href="http://tinyurl.com/3tff3x"><br />By Donald Luskin</a>  Wapo<br />Sunday, September 14, 2008; B01</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the worst of times, and it was the worst of times.&#8221;</p>
<p>I imagine that&#8217;s what Charles Dickens would conclude about the current condition of the U.S. economy, based on the relentless drumbeat of pessimism in the media and on the campaign trail. In the past two months, this newspaper alone has written no fewer than nine times, in news stories, columns and op-eds, that key elements of the economy are the worst they&#8217;ve been &#8220;since the Great Depression.&#8221; That diagnosis has been applied twice to the housing &#8220;slump&#8221; and once to the housing &#8220;crisis,&#8221; to the &#8220;severe&#8221; decline in home prices, to the &#8220;spike&#8221; in mortgage foreclosures, to the &#8220;change&#8221; in the mortgage market and the &#8220;turmoil&#8221; in debt markets, and to the &#8220;crisis&#8221; or &#8220;meltdown&#8221; in financial markets.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a virus &#8212; and it&#8217;s spreading. Do a Google News search for &#8220;since the Great Depression,&#8221; and you come up with more than 4,500 examples of the phrase&#8217;s use in just the past month.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t make any of it true. Things today just aren&#8217;t that bad. Sure, there are trouble spots in the economy, as the government takeover of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and jitters about Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers, amply demonstrate. And unemployment figures are up a bit, too. None of this, however, is cause for depression &#8212; or exaggerated Depression comparisons.</p>
<p>Overall, the pessimists are up against an insurmountable reality: In the last reported quarter, the U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of 3.3 percent, adjusted for inflation. That&#8217;s virtually the same as the 3.4 percent average growth rate since &#8212; yes &#8212; the Great Depression.</p>
<p>Why, then, does the public appear to agree with the media? A recent Zogby poll shows that 66 percent of likely voters believe that &#8220;the entire world is either now locked in a global economic recession or soon will be.&#8221; Actually, that&#8217;s a major clue to what started this thought-contagion about everything being the worst it has been &#8220;since the Great Depression&#8221;: Politics.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Patient zero in this epidemic is the Democratic candidate for president. As it would be for any challenger, it&#8217;s in his interest to portray the incumbent party&#8217;s economic performance in the grimmest possible terms. Barack Obama has frequently used the Depression exaggeration, including during a campaign speech in June, when he said that the &#8220;percentage of homes in foreclosure and late mortgage payments is the highest since the Great Depression.&#8221; At best, this statement is a good guess. To be really true, it would have to be heavily qualified with words such as &#8220;maybe&#8221; or &#8220;probably.&#8221; According to economist David C. Wheelock of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, who has studied the history of mortgage markets for the Fed, &#8220;there are no consistent data on foreclosure or delinquency going all the way back to the Depression.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) database, which allows rigorous apples-to-apples comparisons, only goes back to 1979. It shows that today&#8217;s delinquency rate is only a little higher than the level seen in 1985. As to the foreclosure rate, it was setting records for the day &#8212; the highest since the Great Depression, one supposes &#8212; in 1999, at the peak of the Clinton-era prosperity that Obama celebrated in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention late last month. I don&#8217;t recall hearing any Democratic politicians complaining back then.</p>
<p>Even if Obama is right that the foreclosure rate is the worst since the Great Depression, it&#8217;s spurious to evoke memories of that great national calamity when talking about today &#8212; it&#8217;s akin to equating a sore throat with stomach cancer. According to the MBA, 6.4 percent of mortgages are delinquent to some extent, and 2.75 percent are in foreclosure. During the Great Depression, according to Wheelock&#8217;s research, more than 50 percent of home loans were in default.</p>
<p>Moreover, MBA data show that today&#8217;s foreclosures are concentrated in that small fraction of U.S. homes financed by subprime mortgages. Such homes make up only 12 percent of all mortgages, yet account for 52 percent of foreclosures. This suggests that today&#8217;s mortgage difficulties are probably a side effect of the otherwise happy fact that&#8230;.. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>The game goes on… for now</p>
<p>The first round of musical chairs ended earlier this year when Bear Stearns was the one left standing when the music stopped. Poor little BSC ate too much subprime candy, got too fat and slow, and couldn’t make it to a chair fast enough. JP Morgan Chase got to eat what was left of BSC’s candy, and the US taxpayers got to clean up the wrappers.</p>
<p>Apparently the second round ended yesterday, and Lehman was left without a chair. Lehman didn’t eat too much subprime but apparently had quite the sweet tooth for Alt-A. The other kids are going to be forced to clean up the mess that LEH made, but I think it remains to be seen if the US taxpayers will have to do another good scrubbing.</p>
<p>But it seems two other chairs were pulled from the game this time. Lucky Merrill gets to sit on the lap of Bank of America for the time being (though that lap is getting quite crowded with Countrywide and all). And AIG is begging “Big Mama Fed” for one more chance.</p>
<p>Next few days should be very interesting…</p>

<ol>
<li>There are some assets in the capital markets, many of which are mortgage-related, that were seriously overvalued over the past several years.</p>
</li>
<li>Many of the others are Credit-related (CDS and CDOs and the like).
<ol>
<li>Most of the two asset types listed above are reasonable concepts that, if they are commoditized, appear more liquid than they are. (Ask any homeseller in the current market.)</li>
<li>Multiple sequences, while they don&#8217;t increase the total systemic risk (algebraically impossible), can have a distorting effect on risk, and</li>
<li>Leveraging assets that are not so liquid can lead to cash flow mismatches in the best of circumstances.</li>
</ol>
<p></li>
<li>Attempting to arbitrage a perceived opportunity between a long-term obligation and a similar short-term obligation depends very much on funding, carry considerations, and liquidity.  (Not certain if everyone knows that one—but everyone who does risk management should.)
</li>
<li>The Fed fears a &#8220;contagion effect&#8221; that will do more damage to the financial system than the &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; that accompanies &#8220;saving&#8221; any given firm.
</li>
<li>The Fed &#8220;saved&#8221; Bear Stearns (a.k.a., The Old Firm, or BS for short), to extent that they guaranteed the second through thirty-first billion dollars in losses that JPMC may (or may not) realise from having bought the firm.
</li>
<li>The Fed &#8220;saved&#8221; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the stupidest way possible, ending their forty years in the desert as semi-private entities.

<li>The leaders who drove Fannie and Freddie into the Fed&#8217;s arms were rewarded handsomely for their not-so-creative destruction of their firms, most especially <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/18/AR2008081802111_pf.html">Daniel &#8220;acted-like-Harry&#8221; Mudd</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p></li>
<li>On the surface, a Fed that saved BS should be likely to save LEH. (See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/roubini-and-bail-in-this-weekend.html">rdan&#8217;s post below</a>, citing Nouriel Roubini discussing the similarities.)</li>
</ol>
<p>The center of Roubini&#8217;s argument seems to be this:<br />
<blockquote>But then if on Monday no deal is done Lehman collapses and goes into Chapter 11 court and you have the beginning of a systemic financial meltdown as the run on the other broker dealers will start. Thus, what Fed and Treasury are trying to do this weekend is another 1998 LTCM bailin or Korea 1997 bailin, i.e. trying to convince all the major institutions to either support a purchase of Lehman or maintain their exposure to Lehman if no buyers is found. </p></blockquote>
<p>The Chapter 11 filing <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/lehman-to-file-for-bankruptcy-protection/">appears to be what is about to happen</a>. The rest is, perhaps, <a href="http://www.fleurdelis.com/desiderata.htm">unfolding as it should</a>.</p>
<p>What Roubini is talking about is, basically, the same thing as the &#8220;contagion effect&#8221;  referenced in bullet (4) above.  If Lehmann gets protection, many of its obligations will be reduced.  So if LEH owes you $100 million, you may only get some fraction of that amount, or nothing, depending on the value of the assets and how secured a creditor you are.  So if that $100 million exposure to LEH is essential to your operations, and you haven&#8217;t been able to take actions to mitigate it in the past six months, you may fail.  Etc., <a href="http://www.lyricsfreak.com/t/turtles/eleanor_20242050.html">as the Turtles once said</a>.</p>
<p>So, yes, there will probably be some businesses that—despite <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/03/15-years-investment-in-place-lost-in.html">almost six months of warning</a>, since Bear and Lehmann were spoken of in the same breath, and had approximately the same leverage, when BS was purchased—who will suffer, and probably a few will go out of business.</p>
<p>But the effect of LEH going out of business would <em><strong>not</strong></em> be so severe as the effect of BS going out of business for one reason that Roubini, for some reason, appears not to have mentioned.</p>
<p><em>Lehmann has no clearing business.</em></p>
<p>Had Bear gone out of business, about 30% of the hedge funds in the country would not have been able to execute virtually <em>any</em> transaction for the following thirty days.  Not a payment.  Not a redemption.  Not a trade on a listed exchange.  Not a receipt.  Not a de-leveraging.  Not a swap payment, not a CDS payment, not fulfilling an option exercised against them.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s not just a &#8220;maybe&#8221; about financial collapse in such a scenario; P probably well in excess of 0.9944.  $30 billion is a &#8220;bargain&#8221; in such a situation.</p>
<p>LEH has been on the ropes for at least six months, probably longer.*  They were given a &#8220;word of confidence&#8221; by Goldman at the same time the Street was conspicuously silent about the prospects for BS.***  Anyone who has been looking at their risk positions without looking at their LEH exposure over the past six months doesn&#8217;t belong in the risk management business.  As <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/10/a-battered-lehman-fights-for-survival/">DealBook noted last Wednesday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Financial institutions have been closely measuring their exposure to Lehman. On Tuesday, commercial and investment banks said they continued to do business with Lehman, and hedge funds did not appear to be pulling their accounts with the firm, events that helped precipitate the fall of Bear Stearns.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a brilliant moment in Janet Tavakoli&#8217;s <em><a href="http://www.booksamillion.com/product/9780471412663?id=4214424925428">Credit Derivatives and Synthetic Structures</a></em>:<br />
<blockquote>[B]efore the fall 1997 [Korean banking] crisis, I took a call from a trader at a securities firm&#8230;.The trader told me that several Korean banks were willing to offer credit default protection on other Korean names. In order to bolster up their own credit perception, they were willing to post 30 to 40 percent of the notional amount with G7&#8230;collateral&#8230;.The trader then went on to tell me that Commercial Bank of Korea would sell credit default protection on bonds issued by the Commercial Bank of Korea.<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s very interesting,&#8221; I countered, &#8220;but the credit default option is worthless.&#8221;<br />&#8220;But people are doing it,&#8221; persisted the trader.<br />&#8220;That&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re doing,&#8221; I affirmed. &#8220;The correlation between Commercial Bank of Korea and itself is 100 percent. I would pay nothing for that credit protection. It is worthless for this purpose.&#8221;<br />The trader mustered his best grammar, chilliest tone, and most authoritative voice: &#8220;There are those who would disagree with you.&#8221; (p. 85)</p></blockquote>
<p>Several months later, those people were, presumably, downsized.  Eleven years after that, no one in the market today would make the mistake of not considering the risk of the guarantor as well as the guaranteed.</p>
<p>LEH will file bankruptcy, but the market has largely priced that into its current market valuations.  There will be failures, and there will be many stories about <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/12/for-lehman-employees-the-collapse-is-personal/">the suffering of former LEH employees</a>, and the occasional counterparty without another option close at hand.</p>
<p>But its failure would not have a contagion effect, and any Fed support should be not to save the firm itself but, in the manner of the SBA&#8217;s efforts in NYC seven years ago, small loans to ensure that as few of those counterparties whose businesses are impaired by the LEH bankruptcy are unable to find other sources of capital.</p>
<p>As for the other firms—MER, AIG, etc.—those that can be saved are already <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/bank-of-america-in-talks-to-buy-merrill-lynch/">taking</a> <a href="http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/aig-to-plan-massive-restructuring/">action</a>, if they still can.</p>
<p>After a necessary saving of BS, and an ill-timed, ill-considered <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/deprivatization/">deprivatization</a> (h/t <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/calling-things.html">Brad DeLong</a>) of Fannie and Freddie, letting LEH declare bankruptcy—assuming it remains necessary through the night—is the best choice.</p>
<p>Even if Alan Greenspan <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aMXXouFNfC4I&#038;refer=home">does agree with it</a>.</p>
<p>*If you look at the debt market, they knew BS was a junk or near-junk credit in August of 2007 (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aFbRONWfpjU8">5-yr notes at 245 over</a>), when the stock was still trading at levels well north of 100.** LEH debt at the time was priced significantly higher (<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=aFbRONWfpjU8">10-year notes in July 2007 ca. 140 over</a> [same as Bear link]). &#8220;Lehman&#8217;s credit-default swaps [then] carr[ied] an implied rating of Ba1, according to Moody&#8217;s.&#8221;  And no one believes things go better since then.<br />**There is a reason everyone agrees that fixed income is more difficult to price than equity.  Accordingly, FI people dig a lot deeper in their evaluations. Or, at least, that appears to be the case here.<br />***<a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/04/even-im-not-that-gullible.html">LTCM memories</a>, anyone?</p>
