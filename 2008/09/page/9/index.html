                                <p><a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/_/2008/09/does_anyone_like_this_deal.php">Jonathan Zasloff at the RBC</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Consensus at last!</p>
<p>Just a brief swing around the blogospheric and journalistic circle reveals that everyone seems to hate the atrocious proposal that the administration has made for taxpayers to write it a blank check.</p>
<p>Krugman, Mallaby, Marshall, Bainbridge, Baker, Manzi, and RBC all hate the thing.</p>
<p>This, of course, strongly suggests that the Democrats will cave. If they do, Senator Obama, the ball is in your court.</p></blockquote>
<p>Heh indeedy.</p>
<p>FWIW, I hate it too.  My bias, also FWIW, is to prefer sucking up one&#8217;s principles as to how an economy should be run and extending a safety net rather than allowing key elements of it to fail and going along for the resulting ride.  Pace Ken from earlier, whatever risk there may be from going along with some sort of bailout, there&#8217;s also a risk from sticking to &#8220;principles&#8221; such as they may be.</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/09/bailout-proposal.html">leaked draft of the proposal from the administration</a>, what we have is not only (or not just) a massive fund to bail out &#8216;too big&#8217; (or &#8216;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EconomistsView/~3/396634238/connectedness.html">too interconnected</a>&#8216;) to fail institutions for which quick action may be needed, but rather authorization for authorization for mortgage market interventions anywhere the Secretary of the Treasury sees fit.  However necessary some additional interventions may turn out to be in the end, not every mortgage-related loss in the financial system requires urgent action by Congress with such blank-check terms.</p>
<p>Here are a few notable features.  First, the  broad grant of authority:<br />
<blockquote>(a) Authority to Purchase.&#8211;The Secretary is authorized to purchase, and to make and fund commitments to purchase, on such terms and conditions as determined by the Secretary, mortgage-related assets from any financial institution having its headquarters in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the essence of the blank check — the purchases would be &#8220;on such terms and conditions as determined by the Secretary&#8221; and SecTreas is empowered to purchase &#8220;mortgage-related assets&#8221; from &#8220;any&#8221; domestically-domiciled financial institution.&#8221;  &#8220;On such terms&#8221; certainly can cut different ways: it could involve haircuts worthy of Sweeney Todd — but only if that&#8217;s how SecTreas exercises the available discretion.  Authorizing purchases from &#8220;any&#8221; domestically-domiciled financial institution means that the provisions are not limited to institutions posing systemic risks to the integrity of the financial system. (Apparently &#8220;domestic-domiciled&#8221; is now optional, according to the NYT article linked by Ken.)  Interestingly, &#8220;financial institution&#8221; is undefined, so while the NYT reports that Paulson doesn&#8217;t plan to use his authority to purchase hedge fund assets, it doesn&#8217;t seem that there&#8217;s anything in this language to prevent him from changing his mind.  Last, the definition of &#8220;mortgage-related assets,&#8221; apart from being broad enough to apparently extend the Secretary&#8217;s authority to the foulest toxic waste, does at least ensure that they&#8217;ve covered any needed bailing-out related to busts in commercial mortgages.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d like to see here at a minimum would be more specific language requiring Treasury and some other entities (i.e. including but not necessarily limited to the Fed) jointly certify that an action under this title would be in service of avoidance of financial-system failure.  I&#8217;d also like to see a requirement that the terms of any purchase share any upside of the bailout for bailed-out firms with the public.</p>
<p>The features that look like they protect the public interest are weaker than they look:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 3. Considerations.</p>
<p>In exercising the authorities granted in this Act, the Secretary shall take into consideration means for&#8211;</p>
<p>(1) providing stability or preventing disruption to the financial markets or banking system; and</p>
<p>(2) protecting the taxpayer.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not a lawyer, but as an occupational hazard have had occasion to learn a little about what this construction means. Directing agents to &#8220;take into consideration&#8221; things is not the same as &#8220;requiring&#8221; that they do specific things, not least when the factors to be considered are so vague.  If an action taken under this act includes a statement explaining how those factors were considered, then good luck getting a court to find that discretion was abused.  And if you were inclined otherwise, the belt-and-suspenders provision makes it clear that the intent of the draft legislation is to leave Treasury&#8217;s discretion unfettered:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 8. Review.</p>
<p>Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.<br /><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/398600429/no-deal.html"></a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/398600429/no-deal.html">Brad DeLong</a> looks at that from the left-of-center position and says hell-no to giving this sort of discretion over $700 billion to Phil Gramm or anyone else who might be on John McCain&#8217;s shortlist for Treasury secretary; I&#8217;d have to wonder to what extent Republicans would want to hand the checkbook to one of the <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/06/obama-economic-advisors-and-economic.html">economists for Obama</a> with so few strings attached.  Reportedly Barney Frank is looking to give the Government Accountability Office audit and other oversight authority, and that would be one useful step towards proper oversight of the program.</p>
<p>Josh Marshall <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Talking-Points-Memo/~3/Z_6zdJjzzTc/218444.php">reports that banking lobbyists are already at work</a> trying to get congressional Republicans to oppose the introduction of ancillary provisions, with giving bankruptcy judges the right to modify loan terms chief among those opposed.  Yet the legislation does give Treasury the right to act as if it owns such mortgage rights as it may buy:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 5. Rights; Management; Sale of Mortgage-Related Assets.</p>
<p>(a) Exercise of Rights.&#8211;The Secretary may, at any time, exercise any rights received in connection with mortgage-related assets purchased under this Act.</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;considerations&#8221; of draft Section 3 don&#8217;t particularly reach the level of establishing policies for how any such rights should be exercised.  Obviously expanding this section to direct how Treasury exercises those rights is one of the ways the smarter Democrats are looking to improve the legislation.</p>
<p>Last, there&#8217;s what a cynic might consider the final enablement-of-kleptocracy provision, allowing the Secretary to:<br />
<blockquote>[enter] into contracts, including contracts for services authorized by section 3109 of title 5, United States Code, without regard to any other provision of law regarding public contracts;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear to me why the entirety of contracting law need be bypassed for this purpose; this seems to be a &#8220;stick it in your eye, Good Government&#8221; provision.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s one proposal for improvement that I&#8217;d be disinclined to pursue, it would be general executive-pay reform.  I like DeLong&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/398379129/note-to-self-hi.html">note to self</a>&#8221; on forcing pay above a threshold into restricted equity in principle, but this is not something for quick drafting, as otherwise the statute may just be an intellectual challenge for compensation consultants.  I&#8217;d keep it simple for the purpose of this legislation (assuming it&#8217;s inevitable) and just claw back any incentive pay for some specific set of officers of any firm that sells assets to Treasury under the bailout on terms that ensure the clawback comes out of the officers&#8217; personal wealth.  I&#8217;d like to see them slip in a return to the 39.6% top income tax rate, but I don&#8217;t know that the Democratic leadership has the guts to do so and let the Bushies signal how important they really think the bailout legislation is.</p>
<p>BTW, our friends at Economists for Obama have the <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/09/obama-on-treasury-proposal.html">response from the Obama campaign</a>.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://rogerailes.blogspot.com/2008/09/trip-to-nowhere-shorter-sharia-palin.html">The Good Roger Ailes</a>, ABC News reports that rape kits aren&#8217;t the only thing Sarah Palin tried to leave <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/print?id=5844710">the responsibility of the victim</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Fighting back against allegations she may have fired her then-Public Safety Commissioner, Walt Monegan, for refusing to go along with a personal vendetta, Palin on Monday argued in a legal filing that she fired Monegan because he had a &#8220;rogue mentality&#8221; and was bucking her administration&#8217;s directives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last straw,&#8221; her lawyer argued, came when he planned a trip to Washington, D.C., to seek federal funds for an aggressive anti-sexual-violence program. The project, expected to cost from $10 million to $20 million a year for five years, would have been the first of its kind in Alaska, which leads the nation in reported forcible rape.[emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>The catch:<br />
<blockquote>But the governor&#8217;s staff authorized the trip, according to an internal travel document from the Department of Public Safety, released Friday in response to an open records request.</p>
<p>The document, a state travel authorization form, shows that Palin&#8217;s chief of staff, Mike Nizich, approved Monegan&#8217;s trip to Washington, D.C., &#8220;to attend meeting with Senator Murkowski.&#8221; The date next to Nizich&#8217;s signature reads June 18. </p></blockquote>
<p>and the excuse:<br />
<blockquote>According to Ruaro, Monegan asked for—and received—approval for the travel without telling Palin&#8217;s staff his reason for going. &#8220;As a matter of routine, the travel was approved by Mike Nizich &#8230; weeks before the actual purpose was made clear by former Commissioner Monegan,&#8221; Ruaro wrote.</p></blockquote>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>There are three reasons that the give Paulson $700,000,000,000 to play with plan might save world finance</p>
<p>1) the value of a pool of all the mortgage based assets is easier to determine than the value of particular assets &#8212; making a huge pool of all the toxic sludge will cause it to melt, that is be liquid (check the metaphor is not mixed).</p>
<p>2) If all claims on a mortgage belong to one legal entity, that legal entity can renegotiate the terms of the mortgage and avoid foreclosing.   This is often good for creditors as a group, but when they are many, each one benefits if the others renegotiate and he she or it demands full payment.  Thus reassembling sliced and  diced mortgages will reduce the number of foreclosures with associated legal costs, delays and distress sales of foreclosed properties. </p>
<p>3) by paying more for mortgage based assets than they are worth, Paulson will re-capitalize banks and insurance companies.</p>
<p>Paulson obviously doesn&#8217;t stress the third aspect, and, to the extent that he admits it might happen, would like to present it as an inevitable side effect of the first two.</p>
<p>It is not at all.  All the gain in liquidity and ability to renegotiate which can be achieved with toxic sludge pool belonging to the treasury can be achieved with a new private entity toxic sludge inc whose shares belong to the banks that contributed the sludge.  </p>
<p>If we want to give Paulson a huge amount of authority, we can let him negotiate the price in shares of toxic sludge inc for particular assets.  That would be crazy of course, but not as crazy as letting him spend our money as he pleases.</p>
<p>I think a reasonable plan is to require all banks and insurance companies to pool all their claims on mortgages in exchange for shares proportional to the most recent market price.  The revenue from the mortgages pays them dividends, people can buy and sell shares of toxic sludge inc which is easy to price as it is a claim on a huge pool of mortgages some of which were reasonable business propositions to begin with.</p>
<p>Now a problem with this approach is that with an accurate valuation of shares of toxic sludge inc. many banks will be obviously insolvent (they are already but it isn&#8217;t obvious).</p>
<p>That is a separate problem &#8212; recapitalizing banks.  That can be done by having the treasury buy an equity stake (as proposed by Doug Elmendorf) so that the treasury shares the upside as well as the downside.  </p>
<p>More arguments after the jump.</p>
<p>One problem is that mortgage based assets are currently illiquid, because no one knows what they are worth, and, especially, because their current owners have a better idea than possible buyers.  They are hard to price in large part, because the underlying mortgages are varied.  To own a claim on the proceeds of liars loans is not the same as owning a claim on mortgages whose borrowers documented their income.  Current owners don&#8217;t know as much as they should, but they know more than non-bank investors. Thus there is a market for lemons/adverse selection problem.  The solution to adverse selection problems is a mandate.  All mortgage based assets must be sold to participate (or x% of such assets on the books of participating firms).  This was obvious to my dad and <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/garbage_pail_/2008/09/designing_the_garbage_pail_agency_percentage_proffering.php">Mark Kleiman</a> , who are real smart but not economists.  I&#8217;d say that participation in the scheme can be voluntary, provided that participating means selling all or a multiple of the portfolio of mortgage based assets with no picking and chosing.  Non participating financial institutions are not likely to survive long.</p>
<p>Paulson proposes solving the problem by having the treasury, which has poor information perverse incentives and no accountability, buy the assets for inflated prices.  That is a huge transfer from the public to shareholders and officers of banks. </p>
<p>A huge pool would be easier to price as the nationwide mix of securitized mortgages, bad as it is, produces a revenue stream which is relatively predictable. </p>
<p>Now recapitalization is all well and good, but normally the people who put up the money get an equity stake in exchange.  Recapitalizing by having people deliberately make bad deals on behalf of the public is first a transfer and second a way to guarantee corruption (even if you don&#8217;t count it as corruption in the first place).</p>
<p>There is no logical link between pooling mortgage based assets and nationalizing them.  The only point of creating that link is to privatize public money.</p>

(Or, as I would prefer to write it, just so everyone understands: $900,000,000,000.  About 3,000 a person, or 26.7% of the annual median household income, assuming a family of four.)</p>
<p>What would makes anyone think <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/just-like-beanie-babies.html">another $700,000,000,000</a> will solve the problem?  Just because &#8220;sooner or later, you&#8217;re talking about real money&#8221;?</p>
<p>It is, or should be, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/understanding-t.html">no longer possible to pretend that this is still just a liquidity crisis</a>. Certainly, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/perception-v-reality.html">the Fed isn&#8217;t doing so</a>. It is well beyond that.</p>
<p>Adding liquidity will not solve the problem. And if the plan is to buy assets above their value—then why are we expected to <em>buy</em> Beanie Babies?  Shouldn&#8217;t we be selling them to Treasury Secretary <s>Gramm</s> <s>Fiorina</s> Paulson?</p>

                                <p>With respect to the Pauslon plan, Calculated Risk offers <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/09/paulson-plan-will-it-work.html">this analysis</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The primary goal of the Paulson Plan is to get the banks to lend again &#8211; or &#8220;unclog the system&#8221; as Secretary Paulson put it. Secondary goals are to &#8220;protect the taxpayer&#8221; and hopefully minimize moral hazard.</p>
<p><strong>Will the plan achieve the primary goal? I think the answer is yes.</strong> By removing these troubled assets from the balance sheets of the financial institutions, the banks will able to lend again without lingering doubts about their solvency and viability. At first glance, the size of the plan seems sufficient.</p></blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s getting some flak in comments from some people suggesting that he&#8217;s acting like a shill for the finance industry. (Of course, they&#8217;re conviently overlooking the part where CR says &#8220;the plan does nothing to protect taxpayers or minimize moral hazard.&#8221;) But the thing is, he&#8217;s probably right. This plan probably will unclog the pipes of the financial system and get the banks back to lending like it&#8217;s 2004. But it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s fair.</p>
<p>Let me pose an analogy. Let&#8217;s say I buy and sell Beanie Babies. I sit in front gift shops early in the morning, waiting for them to open so I can be first to snatch up the little critters. I have a buddy who works at Halmark who gives me good deal on the most coveted bears. I turn around and sell them for 100% markup, and they sell like hotcakes. I&#8217;m making hand over fist.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m making so much money that I don&#8217;t know what to do with it. I start to lend some of my money out to my classmates so they can buy snacks during study hall. They pay me back the next day, but with a little fee tacked on. I&#8217;m making more money. Yea me.</p>
<p>But then people figure out that Beanie Babies are just pieces of cloth stuffed with plastic beads and cheap cotton. Prices plummet. I&#8217;ve placed all the ads in several different Beanie Baby magazines, and no one is calling. I sunk all my funds into a big lot of the fancy bears to celebrate the death of Princess Di, thinking I could just keep selling them for twice as much I paid. But no one&#8217;s willing to pay what I paid, let alone my asking price. No one&#8217;s buying them, period.</p>
<p>So what should happen at this point? I made a bad bet, thinking that in this new economy every household will want their own collection of precious little beanies. But it was all a fad, a bubble.</p>
<p>Typically one might expect that my new collection of Princess Di Beanie Babies, now worth nothing more than the material they are made from, would be turned into chew toys for my dog. But here&#8217;s the rub; how are my classmates going to buy snacks during study hall? I don&#8217;t have any money to lend; I blew it all on worthless beanie babies.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where the Fed steps in. We can&#8217;t have a frozen banking system! Who will buy snacks, even if they have to incur a little debt to get some? So they buy the Beanie Babies from me. Maybe not at my initial asking price, but certainly a lot more than what they&#8217;re worth. I offload the bean bags to them, and they fork over the cash. I&#8217;m back in business! Now I have money to lend to my buddies. Yea me again. What to do the excess cash now? Hmmm&#8230; I heard Pokemon cards were selling well&#8230;</p>
<p>CR&#8217;s right; if we give the banking industry $700 billion in exchange for their big stupid pile of Beanie Babies, they will have money to lend. And we will have Beanie Babies. Yea us.</p>

                                <p>At a high level, <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/15/and-then-there-were-two/">Floyd Norris explains it all to you</a>.</p>
<p>UDATED, AND PULLED TO THE FORE: For the more detailed view (h/t <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/09/regulatory-exem.html">Barry R.</a>), the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/21/nyregion/22sun.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print">soon to be late</a>, <a href="http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/010545.html">not very lamented</a>, New York Sun <a href="http://www.nysun.com/business/ex-sec-official-blames-agency-for-blow-up/86130/?print=5279202221">presents the details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The SEC allowed five firms — the three that have collapsed plus Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley — to more than double the leverage they were allowed to keep on their balance sheets and remove discounts that had been applied to the assets they had been required to keep to protect them from defaults.</p>
<p>Making matters worse, according to Mr. Pickard, who helped write the original rule in 1975 as director of the SEC&#8217;s trading and markets division, is a move by the SEC this month to further erode the restraints on surviving broker-dealers by withdrawing requirements that they maintain a certain level of rating from the ratings agencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>and the solution <strong>going forward</strong> (that is, after you give these guys $700 billion) will be an even weaker form:<br />
<blockquote>The SEC said it has no plans to re-examine the impact of the 2004 changes to the net capital rule, and last week, it put out a proposal to revise the rule once again. This time, it is looking to remove the requirement that broker dealers maintain a certain rating from the ratings agencies.</p></blockquote>
<p>Because nothing says &#8220;faith in the institution&#8221; like a non-investment grade rating.</p>
<p>*Title explanation: Mother Courage at the beginning of the play has two (2) children.  By the end, she has two less than that.  The play closes with her &#8220;silent scream&#8221; as she drags her cart along.</p>
<p>If you had only seen that final scene, you would think it is a tragedy <em>of</em> Mother Courage, not one caused by her. Working from memory: One of her children dies because she sends him(?) something that might be salable—in the middle of a battlefield.  The other is similarly sacrificed.  It is the reverse of the &#8220;because he&#8217;s an orphan&#8221; joke.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are about 2 months until the election, an election that will decide the next President of the United States    The person elected will be the president of all Americans, not just the Democrats or the Republicans.</p>
<p>To show our solidarity as Americans, let&#8217;s all get together and show each other our support for the candidate of our choice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time that we all came together, Democrats and Republicans alike.</p>
<p>If you support the policies and character of Barak Obama, please drive with your headlights on during the day.</p>
<p>If you support McCain, please drive with your headlights off at night.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p></blockquote>

<p>We’ve created the most comprehensive page of information on vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin on the Internet &#8211; <br /><a href="http://dailysource.org/palin">Daily Source</a> on the Vice Presidential candidate.</p>
<blockquote><p>Since Gov. Palin is new to just about everyone in the country, little is known about her record and her policies. Our special section has in-depth research, videos, audio clips, excerpts and links to hundreds of articles, including many from newspapers and TV stations in Alaska. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://dailysource.org/about/team">About the team</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The level of research is unparalleled, and the page is updated regularly. Our site’s editors and volunteers include an Emmy-award winning CNN reporter, the former operating editor of the Christian Science Monitor’s Web site, the former head of NPR’s News Blog and the Executive Director of the Online News Association &#8211;</p></blockquote>
