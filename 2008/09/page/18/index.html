<p>Back in January, I had a post entitled <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/why-is-economy-in-trouble-seriously-why.html">Why is the Economy in Trouble? Seriously, Why is the Economy in Trouble?</a>. If I may quote myself extensively (and I may!!):</p>
<blockquote><p>[W]hy is the economy in a state where even rational people are talking about the need for stimulus only a few years after we&#8217;ve had large individual income tax cuts, big cuts on taxes on repatriated corporate income, and continued year after year tax cuts on the estate tax. And let&#8217;s not forget that the Fed has bent over backward to help GW. Take a look at real interest rates since GW took office &#8211; has any president gotten anything even remotely resembling this sort of help since stagflation was vanquished?</p>
<p>So in plain English, we&#8217;ve had a heck of a lot of what we&#8217;re told is fiscal stimulus and a heck of a lot of monetary stimulus since GW took office.<br /><bold>…</bold><br />And yet there&#8217;s still trouble. This administration (and its cheerleaders) have been wrong about everything they&#8217;ve told us about the economy. They promised rapid growth and to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">pay down the debt</a>. In 2007, the surplus was going to be so big that there wouldn&#8217;t be enough retiring bonds to pay off. By 2010, debt was to be 6.5% of GDP. That was their first economic plan.</p>
<p>A recession came &#8211; they blamed it on Clinton and 9/11 and pushed through tax cuts, and more tax cuts. It was a light recession&#8230; short and shallow. But apparently enough so that debt would grow rather than shrink, despite all the help from the Fed. And for some reason, growth was anemic. So they pushed more tax cuts. And growth was still anemic. Eventually, in mid &#8211; 2003, the economy started to pick up again. There was much trumpeting of horns and pontificating and gloating. We&#8217;ve had average real growth for a few years plus a big run-up in the debt, and now we&#8217;re back to worrying about a downturn again? Now? So soon after their wonderful remedy produced what Kudlow called the Goldilocks economy?</p>
<p>Which raises a question&#8230; what are they going to blame it on now? Clinton has been out of office too long, its been more than six years since 9/11, Congress has given them just about everything they wanted, and the Fed could not be more cooperative. (In fact, anyone could see the Fed helped so much for so long, it created its own problem&#8230; which is where we are at this point.) So what is left? Why the very short, very sub-par expansion? If its not Clinton, and not 9/11, and not the Fed, and not some big problem from abroad, then what? Random chance? For no particular reason, this happened now? Or is it their economy, their policies?</p>
<p>My guess is that they&#8217;ll find some other reason, something other than their own actions and remedies and prescriptions. Because as far as GW and his cheerleaders are concerned, this situation gives them an excuse to peddle some more of their failed remedies and inane prescriptions. After what we&#8217;ve seen since January of 2001, a decent man would not go before the American public with a smirk on his face and tell us we need more tax cuts. But GW will. And decent people would not see the smirk and hear the call for more of the same and support it. But the cheerleaders will. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I guess now, a few months later, we see that GW isn&#8217;t the only one who goes before the American public and tells us we need more tax cuts. But the question stands – if tax cuts are beneficial, why has the economy performed so poorly for seven and a half years?</p>
<p>This is not a business cycle thing – its not like the economy did well for part of his term and we&#8217;re now in a trough. GW is on currently on track to finish his term with an annualized growth rate of around 1.3% of real GDP per capita. Since Ike took office, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">Ike, Ford and Bush Sr.</a> produced growth rates that were that dismal. But <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/comparing-presidents-national-debt.html">Ike was diligent about paying down the debt</a>, Ford had to contend with an Oil Crisis and disco, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/growth-fed-and-presidents.html">Bush Sr. got hosed by Alan Greenspan</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>GW has had everything his way for a very long time, he got to implement the policies he wanted, he got help from the Fed, and he didn&#8217;t seem to worry about deficits. So, after all of this, I ask again, why has the economy performed so poorly since GW took office? What gets the blame? Something other than policy must, or McCain wouldn&#8217;t be peddling more of the same.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s compare the two candidates policies, major component by major component.  It will not be easy because they are both extensive but modestly detailed.  Furthermore, you the reader will have to do some work by reading their plans.  So let&#8217;s get started with &#8220;Energy&#8221; because it is, to my mind the core of what must happen to implement most of their other policies.   Here are the specific links to the candidates Web sites policy on energy in alphabetical order.<br /><a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/17671aa4-2fe8-4008-859f-0ef1468e96f4.htm">McCain</a><br /><a href="http://www.barackobama.com/index.php">Obama</a></p>
<p>McCains preamble: <br />Our nation&#8217;s future security and prosperity depends on the next President making the hard choices that will break our nation&#8217;s strategic dependence on foreign sources of energy and will ensure our economic prosperity by meeting tomorrow&#8217;s demands for a clean portfolio. John McCain has made the necessary choices &#8211; producing more power, pushing technology to help free our transportation sector from its use of foreign oil, cleaning up our air and addressing climate change, and ensuring that Americans have dependable energy sources. John McCain will lead the effort to develop advanced transportation technologies and alternative fuels to promote energy independence and cut off the flow of oil wealth to repressive dictatorships like Iran. </p>
<p>Major components of McCain&#8217;s energy policy<br />&#8212; Expanding Domestic Oil And Natural Gas Exploration And Production <br />&#8212; Taking Action Now To Break Our Dependency On Foreign Oil By Reforming Our Transportation Sector <br />&#8212; Investing In Clean, Alternative Sources Of Energy<br />&#8212; Protecting Our Environment And Addressing Climate Change: A Sound Energy Strategy Must Include A Solid Environmental Foundation <br />&#8212; Promoting Energy Efficiency<br />&#8212; Addressing Speculative Pricing Of Oil    </p>
<p>Obama&#8217;s preamble:<br />Obama’s comprehensive New Energy for America plan will:<br />    * Provide short-term relief to American families facing pain at the pump<br />    * Help create five million new jobs by strategically investing $150 billion over the next ten years to catalyze private efforts to build a clean energy future.<br />    * Within 10 years save more oil than we currently import from the Middle East and Venezuela combined.<br />    * Put 1 million Plug-In Hybrid cars &#8212; cars that can get up to 150 miles per gallon &#8212; on the road by 2015, cars that we will work to make sure are built here in America.<br />    * Ensure 10 percent of our electricity comes from renewable sources by 2012, and 25 percent by 2025.<br />    * Implement an economy-wide cap-and-trade program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 80 percent by 2050.</p>
<p>Major components of Obama&#8217;s energy policy<br />&#8212; Provide Short-term Relief to American Families<br />&#8212; Eliminate Our Need for Middle Eastern and Venezuelan Oil within 10 Years<br />&#8212; Create Millions of New Green Jobs<br />&#8212; Reduce our Greenhouse Gas Emissions 80 Percent by 2050<br />&#8212; Barack&#8217;s environmental plan<br />&#8212; Barack&#8217;s plan to crack down on excessive energy speculation</p>
<p>CoRev put this together.  If other sources are available please link in comments. I am sure there are good data sources as well. Tom would also be good at this.  There will still be posts on campaign spin.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In the last installment of this Social Security series we kind of dug into some of the details of unfunded liability, what it was and what it wasn&#8217;t and most importantly where the incidence occured: in the past or in the future. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/backwards-transfer-is-back.html">Backwards Transfer is Back</a>. In the course of that I think it became pretty clear that none of that liability really was the consequence of overpayments to what Social Security calls &#8216;past participants&#8217; that instead it was all due to a gap between future cost and future income for &#8216;current participants&#8217;. But in the course of that discussion the role of &#8216;future participants&#8217; fell through the crack when instead the numbers have some surprising implications. But before getting to that I want to back up and consider Unfunded Liability more broadly.</p>
<p>Traditionally Social Security has judged solvency over the short term (10 years) and the long term (75 years). Which seems reasonable enough, 75 years being a period that will capture the retirement years of pretty much any current worker. The metrics of solvency were typically expressed as percentage of payroll or percentage of GDP. In 2003 the Reports introduced  new measures of solvency which expressed the gap between income and cost in Present Value dollars over the 75 year window and indeed over the Infinite Future. The first set of numbers just divides this into periods: first 75 years, 75 years to Infinite Future, and total and expresses it in dollars.<br />2003: $3.5 trillion, $7 trillion, $10.5 trillion<br />2004: $3.7 trillion, $6.7 trillion, $10.4 trillion<br />2005: $4.0 trillion, $7.1 trillion, $11.1 trillion<br />2006: $4.6 trillion, $8.6 trillion, $13.4 trillion<br />2007: $4.7 trillion, $8.9 trillion, $13.6 trillion<br />2008: $4.3 trillion, $8.3 trillion, $13.6 trillion<br />What do these numbers tell us? Well not much really. Generally you would expect the unfunded liability over the first seventy five years to increase simply because of normal population growth, we will have more people overall in year seventy-six than we do in year one, as we drop the latter and add the former we can expect an uptick in liability which right now is about .06% of payroll. The relatively small changes from 2003 to 2004 and 2006 to 2007 can be explained in this way. On the other hand the bigger movements from 2005 to 2006 or 2007 to 2008 turn out on examination to be the result of additional changes in assumptions, in the first case in assumed interest and in the latter changes in assumptions about immigration. But other than that the numbers don&#8217;t really give us much guidance except perhaps to wonder why the future numbers from year 76 on, representing as they do the Infinite Future are not even larger. To get insight into this we need to move to a more granular analysis. Which comes under the fold.</p>
<p>The Table numbers vary a little bit between reports with what was Tables IV.B7 and IV.B8 in earlier Reports become IV.B6 and IV.7 but all are titled <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#267528">Present Values of OASDI Cost Less Tax Revenue and Unfunded Obligations for Program Participants[Present values as of January 1, 2008; dollar amounts in trillions]</a> People who read the last post may remember that the Trustees break down &#8220;Program Participants&#8217; in kind of an odd way:<br />&#8216;Past participants&#8217; would seem to be that group of people who formerly drew benefits but no longer do. In short the dead.<br />&#8216;Current participants&#8217; are defined as everyone fifteen and older and so include all current workers and current retirees.<br />&#8216;Future participants&#8217; are defined as everyone under fifteen plus those not yet born. The table assigns dollar figures to these groups as follows:<br />Row 1 = &#8220;Present value of future cost less future taxes for current participants&#8221; (Over the next 100 years)<br />Row 2 = &#8220;Less current trust fund&#8221;<br />Row 3 = &#8220;Equals unfunded obligation for past and current participants&#8221; (Note that in this case the contribution of past participants is likely positive overall)<br />Row 4 = &#8220;Plus present value of cost less tax for future participants for through the infinite future&#8221;<br />Row 5 = &#8220;Equals unfunded obligation for all participants through the infinite future&#8221;<br />This result can be expressed as an equation. So what does it look like over the same period as above? (Figures in trillions)<br />2003: $11.9 &#8211; $1.4 = $10.5  -$.0 = $10.5<br />2004: $12.7 &#8211; $1.5 = $11.2  -$.8 = $10.4<br />2005: $13.7 &#8211; $1.7 = $12.0  -$.9 = $11.1<br />2006: $15.1 &#8211; $1.9 = $13.3 + $.1 = $13.4<br />2007: $16.5 &#8211; $2.0 = $14.4 &#8211; $.8   = $13.6<br />2008: $17.4 &#8211; $2.2 = $15.2 &#8211; $1.5 = $13.6 (rounding is Trustees&#8217;)</p>
<p>What does this tell us? Well actually quite a bit. The increases in column one are mostly I think to be explained by current demographics, fewer people entering the workforce compared to the large cohort of Boomers leaving. And column two is just showing the effects of a Trust Fund in current surplus with column three being the simple sum. </p>
<p>But it is column four that is most interesting to me. Biggs looks at that and sees future participants paying more in taxes than they are projected to get in benefits. I suggest that is the wrong way to look at it, instead turn it around. In 2003 future participants, then defined as all people born after 1988, taken as a whole could expect their benefits to be fully funded by their taxes. Which is to say that long term Social Security is projected to return to pay-go with a surplus and that all of the problem is in fact confined to the next 100 years.</p>
<p>This has some profound implications for policy. Under current projections Social Security is set to pay out 78% of the scheduled benefit starting in 2041, an amount that will shrink to 75% at the end of the 75 year window. But at that point the very youngest of the &#8216;current participants&#8217; of 2008 will be 90 and the impact of that cohort will be fading rapidly and we can reasonably expect it will go to zero right at the end of the hundred year period. Meaning that any fixes we choose to put in over the next couple of decades could be reversed later on with no damage to the long, long term outlook for Social Security. In actual practice there is no way we could limit the impacts of any medium term fixes to the current batch of current participants, some of the earlier cohorts of future participants will no doubt be called to sacrifice along with existing current participants. But there is a light at the end of that long tunnel. And if over the next couple of decades we can beat the current economic projections and so reduce the growth of column one and three we can make that light brighter and brighter.</p>
<p>In the light of the above equations Social Security&#8217;s unfunded liability is more akin to a fixed term mortgage than an infinite burden. We can and should take some efforts to pay it down quicker while knowing that given regular payments it goes away some time in the next hundred years anyway. As the post title notes, that liability is effectively bookended.</p>

                                <p>Hat tip to Anonymous for the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/18/AR2008081802111.html">Wapo</a> article.</p>
<blockquote><p>In January 2007, as years of loose mortgage lending were about to send the nation&#8217;s housing market into devastating decline, Fannie Mae chief executive Daniel H. Mudd wrote a confidential memo to his board. </p>
<p>Discussing the company&#8217;s successes, Mudd said one of Fannie Mae&#8217;s achievements in 2006 was expanding its involvement in the market for subprime and other nontraditional mortgages. He called it a step &#8220;toward optimizing our business.&#8221; </p>
<p>A month later, Fannie Mae outlined plans to further expand its activities in the subprime market. The company recognized the already weak performance of subprime loans but predicted that they would get better in 2007, according to another Fannie Mae document. </p>
<p>Internal documents show that even late in the housing bubble, Fannie Mae was drawn to risky loans by a variety of temptations, including the desire to increase its market share and fulfill government quotas for the support of low-income borrowers. </p>
<p>Since then, Fannie Mae&#8217;s exposure to loosely underwritten mortgages has produced billions of dollars of losses and sent its stock price plummeting, prompting the federal government to prepare for a potential taxpayer bailout of the company. This month, Fannie Mae reported that loans from 2006 and 2007 accounted for almost 60 percent of its second-quarter credit losses. </p>
<p>Fannie Mae documents from the period, obtained by The Washington Post, paint a picture of a company with the dual incentives of fostering affordable housing and making money, and of one caught between the imperatives of increasing its market share while avoiding excessive risk. In a bid to juggle these demands, the company&#8217;s executives took on risks they either misunderstood or unduly minimized.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Four years later, however, Senator Obama enters the picture with, apparently, a different point of view. He has not been coy about wanting to use the tax code to redistribute income more aggressively. He has proposed modest tax cuts (about $1,000) for numerous middle-class Americans, cuts to be financed by much higher taxes on the richest few percent of the population. When all of Senator Obama’s proposed tax increases on the rich are added up, the top marginal rate on wage income would be nearly 50 percent.  But for dividend income, Senator Obama has proposed only a modest increase in the top tax rate, to 20 percent from 15 percent. That is, the personal income tax would continue to tax dividends at a far lower rate than ordinary income. This decision must surprise many of his Congressional supporters. But it should be making President Bush smile. In light of Senator Obama’s stand, the politics of dividend taxation may take some surprising twists. Senator John McCain wants to maintain the current tax rate of 15 percent on dividends (while cutting the corporate tax), but it is a good bet that if Senator McCain is elected president, while Congress remains Democratic, Congress won’t give the Republican president what he wants. They would instead let the Bush tax cuts expire, returning the dividend tax for high-income taxpayers to about 40 percent.  By contrast, if Mr. Obama is elected, Congressional Democrats will be less likely to balk at his proposed 20 percent dividend tax rate and thus embarrass the new president from their own party. This leads to one of the great ironies of the political season. On the issue of dividend taxation, Barack Obama may be the candidate with the best chance of preserving George Bush’s legacy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier in this op-ed, he made the case why dividend taxation had distortive incentive effects and then stated this about the 2003 debate to reduce the dividend tax rate to 15 percent:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many Democrats pointed out, correctly, that the most immediate beneficiaries were rich. The poor don’t own much dividend-paying stock. Middle-class families hold more equities, but they often do so in retirement accounts, which are already tax-preferred. Wonkish arguments that a better allocation of resources would improve the overall economy were dismissed as “trickle-down economics.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The improvement in incentives might have had a small benefit to the overall economy but the fairness issue is still a critical one.  But maybe President Obama can achieve improvements in tax progressivity at lowers costs to efficiency.</p>

                                <p>At the cost of tens of billions to the American taxpayer, the U.S. government will bailout Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both private companies created by Congress. Back in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/06/business/06fannie.html?_r=3&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">March</a>,<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Because of the widespread perception that the government would intervene if either company failed, they can borrow money at lower interest rates than their competitors. As a result, they have earned enormous profits that have enriched shareholders and managers alike: from 1990 to 2000, each company’s stock grew more than 500 percent and top executives were paid tens of millions of dollars.<br />&#8230;In a March meeting, Freddie Mac’s chairman, Richard F. Syron, bolstered those fears by saying the company would put shareholders’ interests first. </p>
<p>What is the nature of the bailout, whose investment is protected and whose investment is not?</p>
<p>Update:  <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/">Market Watch</a> </p>
<p>Consider the description of the bailout from the: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/business/07fannie.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">New York Times</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>Investors who own the companies’ common and preferred stock will suffer. <em>Holders of debt, including many foreign central banks, are expected to receive government backing.</em> Top executives of both companies will be pushed out, according to those briefed on the plan. [italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Now consider the following from <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/chinese-government-top-foreign-holder/story.aspx?guid=%7B347DF7BF-F0B7-48C9-A418-5A0B903D9F72%7D&#038;dist=hppr">MarketWatch</a>,<br />
<blockquote>The top five foreign holders of Freddie and Fannie long-term debt are China, Japan, the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg, and Belgium. In total foreign investors hold over $1.3 trillion in these agency bonds, according to the U.S. Treasury&#8217;s most recent &#8220;Report on Foreign Portfolio Holdings of U.S. Securities.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>China alone holds $376 billion in bond holdings. </p>
<p>Unless I am misreading something, foreign central banks will be protected, including China&#8217;s&#8230;and the America taxpayer will foot that bill. </p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122072588739407007.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">Secretary Paulson</a> has been busy of late reassuring foreign central banks that they will be protected. </p>
<blockquote><p>In recent weeks, Treasury officials have been reaching out to foreign central banks and other overseas buyers of securities or debt sold by the two companies, to reassure them of the creditworthiness of these instruments.</p>
<p>In one such conversation, at the end of August, the Treasury sought to reassure the Bank of Mexico, according to a person familiar with the matter, of the soundness of agency securities held by the bank. Treasury officials have also had similar conversations with Japanese investors who are buyers and holders of agency debt.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The collapse of Fannie and Freddie is being heard around the world. Although both presidential candidates may not be giving it the real attention it deserves, both have heard the collapse.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. John McCain, the Republican nominee for president, has said his goal is to make the companies &#8220;go away&#8221; and to push for regulation that &#8220;limits their ability to borrow, shrinks their size until they are no longer a threat to our economy and privatizes and eliminates their links to the government.&#8221; Sen. McCain supported giving Treasury the authority to backstop the firms but has said any use of taxpayer funds should be combined with an ouster of management and a ban on lobbying by the companies.</p>
<p>Sen. Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, has said the companies are a &#8220;weird blend&#8221; and that &#8220;if these are public entities, then they&#8217;ve got to get out of the profit-making business, and if they&#8217;re private entities, then we don&#8217;t bail them out.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The meaning and ramifications of this collapse cannot be unravelled in a single post&#8211;or a hundred posts. Mismanagement, corporate greed and excess need examining. </p>
<p>Once again, the U.S. taxpayer will be asked to shoulder another mountain of debt. Once again, the taxpayer has become the prop of last resort as poorly managed entities become too big to fail. How long this can continue is the question. </p>
<p>Everything seems broken. No one seems to be safely in charge. Instead, I imagine public officials&#8211;Bernanke and Paulson&#8211; racing frantically from meeting to meeting, making assurances, looking for the next band-aid. </p>
<p>John McCain wants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to shrink so that their size no longer is a threat. Would he say the same thing about Bear Stearns, albeit it is far smaller? Should Bear Stearns not have been allowed to grow so large? How do we shrink such a massive entities? Remember, they hold over $5 trillion in mortgages. Do we hold a fire sale? And would he apply the lobbying rule to other large companies? After all, they now have a heavy hand in writing the regulations that govern them. (The Medicare Part D fiasco is evidence of just how influential the pharmaceuticals were in deciding just what regulations were best for them.) Is it big government that is the problem&#8211;or big corporations that run the government? </p>
<p>Obama wants Fannie and Freddie out of the profit-making business. Is America ready for nationalizing such institutions? Is Obama? And could we have afforded a total collapse of Bear Stearns? Can the government simply allow such things to happen if the consequence for the nation is dire? </p>
<p>And how does the next president reassure our foreign creditors that the U.S. will pay its bills? </p>
<p>While we may be dismayed that foreign central banks will receive &#8220;government backing,&#8221; we do not have much choice.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601080&#038;sid=aslo2E01QVFI&#038;refer=asia">Yu Yongding</a>, former advisor to China&#8217;s central bank, put the matter bluntly:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;If the U.S. government allows Fannie and Freddie to fail and international investors are not compensated adequately, the consequences will be catastrophic,&#8221; Yu said in e-mailed answers to questions yesterday. &#8220;If it is not the end of the world, it is the end of the current international financial system.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>Foreign central banks have been<a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050701faresponse84415/brad-setser/how-scary-is-the-deficit.html"> propping </a>up the U.S. economy:<br />
<blockquote>Foreign central banks have financed the United States to keep their export sectors &#8212; heavily dependent on U.S. consumer spending &#8212; humming. But they now must weigh the benefits of providing the United States with such &#8220;vendor financing&#8221; against the rising costs of keeping the current system going.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yu Yongding is not making a threat; he is stating a fact. </p>
<p>If foreign central banks stop financing U.S. debt (there are no free rides), then the U.S. is in a world of hurt. As <a href="http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20050701faresponse84415/brad-setser/how-scary-is-the-deficit.html">Brad Setser</a> notes: </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;in fact, the economic and financial risks that arise from the U.S. current account deficit (and the resulting dependence on foreign financing) have not been exaggerated. If anything, they have received too little attention &#8212; and are set to grow in the coming years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, &#8220;the coming years&#8221; may be sooner, not later. For the U.S., the consequences may be immediate inflation as Treasury attempts to makes its offerings more palatable. The dollar will plunge. And these are just for starters. </p>
<p>The party is over. Sorry that most of you working stiffs missed it. Oh, by the way, here&#8217;s the bill. </p>
<p>As <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/14/opinion/14krugman.html?_r=2&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin&#038;oref=slogin">Paul Krugman </a>said: </p>
<blockquote><p>I used to think that the major issues facing the next president would be how to get out of Iraq and what to do about health care. At this point, however, I suspect that the biggest problem for the next administration will be figuring out which parts of the financial system to bail out, how to pay the cleanup bills and how to explain what it’s doing to an angry public. </p></blockquote>
<p>Although the American public is not exactly happy with the economy, it has no idea of the depth of the problems. Most people think the government&#8217;s check writing ability is infinite. </p>
<p>Well, the government is broke and broken. </p>
<p>As far as I can see, neither candidate is willing to tell us frankly just how dire our difficulties are&#8211;and to whom we owe money. We have off-shored much of our manufacturing sector in the name of efficiency and profits, ignored our energy needs, and allowed our financial institutions to rape and pillage the countryside. Some have grumbled and tightened their belts; others have smiled and fattened their wallets; yet others have just watched and written studies on entrepreneurial innovation.</p>
<p>Regardless of who wins the upcoming election, the next president will faced enormous problems and a lot of anger&#8230;and not much in the way of solutions. </p>
<p>Right now, there are no easy answers.</p>

                                <p>Via Drs. <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/bush-administra.html">DeLong</a> and <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_08_31_archive.html#6248052711832110997">Black</a>, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/05/AR2008090503351_pf.html">WaPo reports</a> that this version of the S&#038;L crisis will repeat the mistakes of the last one:<br />
<blockquote>Instead of giving each company a big capital infusion upfront, the government could make quarterly injections as the companies&#8217; losses warrant, the sources said. This would be an attempt to minimize the initial cost of the rescue. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>And why are they doing this?  Who gets protected while the hemorrhaging continues?<br />
<blockquote>The value of the companies&#8217; common stock would be diluted but not wiped out, while the holdings of other securities, including company debt and preferred shares might be protected by the government.</p></blockquote>
<p>So who are the <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/mh?s=FNM">major individual holders of the stock</a>?  Why, the directors of the company, the five of whom listed hold over 2.1 million shares.</p>
<p>That is, the same people who were tasked with ensuring that the company was well run—and have failed miserably at it—are being saved by the form of the bailout, while the cost—again, judging by the lessons of the slow-motion S&#038;L meltdown—will be increasing for the taxpayers.</p>
<p>The next time someone asks me if I believe in &#8220;free-market capitalism,&#8221; I&#8217;m going to ask if they believe in the Easter Bunny.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I have seen lots of liberals making the case that she is not.  Some of these arguments get really tedious and confusing but perhaps the most succinct one comes from a fellow resident of Wasilla named <a href="http://mudflats.wordpress.com/2008/09/04/a-letter-about-sarah-palin-from-anne-kilkenny">Anne Kilkenny</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sarah campaigned in Wasilla as a “fiscal conservative”. During her 6 years as Mayor, she increased general government expenditures by over 33%. During those same 6 years the amount of taxes collected by the City increased by 38%. This was during a period of low inflation (1996-2002). She reduced progressive property taxes and increased a regressive sales tax which taxed even food. The tax cuts that she promoted  benefited large corporate property owners way more than they benefited residents.</p>
<p>The huge increases in tax revenues during her mayoral administration weren’t enough to fund everything on her wish list though, borrowed money was needed, too. She inherited a city with zero debt, but left it with indebtedness of over $22 million. What did Mayor Palin encourage the voters to borrow money for? Was it the infrastructure that she said she supported? The sewage treatment plant that the city lacked? or a new library? No. $1m for a park. $15m-plus for construction of a multi-use sports complex which she rushed through to build on a piece of property that the City didn’t even have clear title to, that was still in litigation 7 yrs later–to the delight of the lawyers involved! The sports complex itself is a nice addition to the community but a huge money pit, not the profit-generator she claimed it would be. She also supported bonds for $5.5m for road projects that could have been done in 5-7 yrs without any borrowing. While Mayor, City Hall was extensively remodeled and her office redecorated more than once.  These are small numbers, but Wasilla is a very small city.</p>
<p>As an oil producer, the high price of oil has created a budget surplus in Alaska. Rather than invest this surplus in technology that will make us energy independent and increase efficiency, as Governor she proposed distribution of this surplus to every individual in the state.  In this time of record state revenues and budget surpluses, she recommended that the state borrow/bond for road projects, even while she proposed distribution of surplus state revenues: spend today’s surplus, borrow for needs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Spend and borrow – the fiscal conservatism of Ronald Reagan, George W. Bush, and now McCain and Palin.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/09/obama_rebukes_palin_on_earmark.php">Barack Obama</a> blasts Palin on her earmark record:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be fooled,&#8221; Obama told the crowd surrounding him in a large barn. &#8220;John McCain&#8217;s party, with the help of John McCain, has been in charge&#8221; for nearly eight years.  &#8220;I know the governor of Alaska has been saying she&#8217;s change, and that&#8217;s great,&#8221; Obama said. &#8220;She&#8217;s a skillful politician. But, you know, when you&#8217;ve been taking all these earmarks when it&#8217;s convenient, and then suddenly you&#8217;re the champion anti-earmark person, that&#8217;s not change. Come on! I mean, words mean something, you can&#8217;t just make stuff up.&#8221;  McCain has vowed to wipe out earmarks, which are targeted funding for specific projects that lawmakers put into spending bills. As governor, Palin originally supported earmarks for a controversial $398 million Alaska project dubbed the &#8220;bridge to nowhere.&#8221; But she dropped her support after the state&#8217;s likely share of the cost rose. She hung onto $27 million to build the approach road to the bridge.  Under Palin&#8217;s leadership, Alaska this year asked for almost $300 per person in requests for pet projects from one of McCain&#8217;s top adversaries: indicted Sen. Ted Stevens. That&#8217;s more than any other state received, per person, from Congress for the current budget year. Other states got just $34 worth of local projects per person this year, on average, according to Citizens Against Government Waste, a Washington-based watchdog group.The state government&#8217;s earmark requests to Congress in her first year in office exceeded $550 million, more than $800 per resident.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess to supporters of McCain-Palin, reality has a liberal bias and facts are sexist.</p>

<p>Dan, may I suggest an open thread that allow us to list the various policy issues and then discuss them.</p>
<p>I would start with:<br />1) Economic<br />2) Energy<br />3) Jobs [and I consider 1,2 &#038; 3 to be closely interlinked]<br />4) Fiscal<br />&#8212; Balanced Budget<br />&#8212; Taxes<br />5) National Security</p>
<p>It is hard to divorce any one policy or subpart from its economic impacts. Maybe that&#8217;s why we are all on this open discussion Econ blog.</p>
<p>Rdan replies:</p>
<p>Yes, I will try it as a way for right and left to stay on issues.  We have plenty of representation.  Is it possible when even people like Mary McArdle, others are assigning interns and other people are assigning TAs to monitor comments.  This is a ferocious assault for control by people self-absorbed or suspended values of honesty.</p>
<p>It is the kind of thing to test one&#8217;s beliefs in the honesty people can be capable of, and the kind of restraint that threatens even the staunchest self-control.</p>
<p>Possible?? I do not know.  Some of us are pretty touchy and loaded like tight springs.  For you, intrepid rightside of center, I will respect your request and try this as an experiment.  Someone will certainly bust in to disrupt the flow and others can claim injury&#8230;if so it will not work.</p>
<p>If people stay on topic I or others can delete obvious offenders and no one will miss the deletions if no one responds.  Any other ideas from readers? </p>
<p>Start with jobs, trade??  I realize this can be simply &#8220;asking for it&#8221;.</p>
