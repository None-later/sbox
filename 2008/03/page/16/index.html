                                <p>So says <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/03/12/bush-would-like-a-stronger-dollar">WSJ RealTime Economics</a>.  <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/03/bush_would_like.html">Menzie Chinn</a> discusses the reasons for the recent dollar devaluation:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think that President Bush has a good insight in focusing on long-term growth as a determinant of the dollar&#8217;s path. In particular, I want to highlight the fact that the dollar&#8217;s decline began before the Fed starting slashing interest rates. In Figure 2, I plot the real value of the dollar against major currencies and the US-euro area real interest differential (the interbank rate minus lagged one year inflation). Even as the US-euro area real interest differential increased in 2005-06, the dollar was declining.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the dollar devaluation is not entirely explained by the interest rate effects from the Federal Reserve’s easy monetary policy.  Menzie also notes a portfolio balance effect, an effect from at least the perception that wealth is declining, and trend GDP effects.  But let’s read on as to why President Bush might want a stronger dollar:</p>
<blockquote><p>Q: You mentioned that one of the reasons that’s driving up the price of oil is the dollar. You have said that you are for a strong dollar. Do we have a strong dollar now?<br />Bush: We have a dollar that’s adjusting, and I am for a strong dollar. One reason I am for a strong dollar is because I want, you know, people to — I think it helps deal with inflation. And you’re right, the weakening dollar has affected our capacity to be able to purchase energy. I mean, we’re dependent on energy from overseas. Our dollar doesn’t buy as many barrels of oil as it used to, and so therefore it’s more expensive for the American people. And that’s why I’m for a strong dollar; one reason.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=03&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=oil_is_priced_in_dollars_it_do">Dean Baker</a> would not agree that dollar devaluation is what is causing high oil prices:</p>
<blockquote><p>Listening to NPR heard this morning I heard NPR mislead their listeners on this issue twice in less than an hour. That&#8217;s pretty good in the misinformation department.  The first time was in their top of the hour news. They told listeners that the dollar was falling in world currency markets. Then they told audiences that because oil is priced in dollars, the falling dollar meant higher oil prices.   This should have led to a huge &#8220;huh?&#8221; from NPR&#8217;s audience. A lower value of the dollar means that it will take more dollars to buy oil regardless of what currency it is priced. In fact, we would have to pay more dollars for oil even if it were priced in pig intestines.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bush also seems to agree with <a href="http://kudlow.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Zjk4MTcxZWViMjE1ZGI3OWEwY2Q0NmYwNzcwYjI3NWI=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> on the desire for a stronger dollar via tighter monetary policy but I have <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/kudlow-on-reagans-strong-dollar-policy_04.html">argued</a> that such a policy would tend to lower net export demand making a lot of bad things even worse.  If Bush, Kudlow, and McCain want the GOP agenda to be a strong dollar campaign that would lower net export demand and hence make the upcoming recession worse, maybe the Democratic nominee should strongly disagree.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Sometimes conspiracy theories just keep getting better. In an early piece, I drew a line between the OCC and the Spitzer downfall. Now the connection appears a bit stronger. Two banks are involved in red flagging Spitzer. Both are national banks; both were involved in making excessive sub prime and predatory loans. The OCC is charged with overseeing both.</p>
<p>The first bank is North Fork Bank, a subsidiary of Capital One. The second is HSBC Bank USA. As I said, both are national banks making predatory loans; the OCC is charged with overseeing both.</p>
<p>As the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/13/nyregion/13legal.html">New York Times</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As it turned out, both the North Fork Bank and HSBC had faced inquiries into their lending practices led by Mr. Spitzer when he was New York attorney general. In the case of North Fork, Mr. Spitzer announced a settlement in 2003 requiring it to refund more than $20,000 to dozens of homeowners and cease what he said was its practice of charging homeowners illegal fees.</p></blockquote>
<p>I do admire the chutzpah in the responses both these banks and the OCC have made:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>These officials said that banks are likely to more closely monitor the transactions of politicians like Mr. Spitzer than those of average customers. In part, that is because of legislation passed after the 2001 terrorist attacks.<br />As part of the &#8220;know your customer&#8221; requirements, banks must assess their clients’ financial patterns and set guidelines to ensure that an alarm is sounded if there are unusual transactions, said Bob Serino, a former deputy chief counsel at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, who now advises banks and individuals on anti-money laundering regulations.</p></blockquote>
<p>Know your customer? Well, did Bob Serino advise these banks not to make thousands of questionable, predatory loans? But maybe that was part of the &#8220;know your customer&#8221; jingle.</p>
<p>The NYT piece continues:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;The idea is that if somehow a customer who usually deposits $3,000 a week starts depositing $300,000 into his account daily, that would be kicked out and looked at,&#8221; Mr. Serino said. &#8220;Banks could certainly decide that a politician’s risk rate is higher and thus have a higher level of due diligence set for someone like Spitzer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Spitzer&#8217;s deposits were approximately $10,000.</p>
<p>Now, look at how 911 has now been used:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>A former director of FinCEN, who now works in the industry at a company whose policies prohibit speaking on the record, said that since 9/11, suspicious activity reports had increasingly been used as a source of tips for law enforcement.<br />&#8220;What 9/11 taught us is the value of financial information,&#8221; the former director said. &#8220;Money doesn’t lie. Money leaves a footprint. And that’s exactly what happened with Spitzer.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>In addition, banks must exercise an extra level of due diligence for a &#8220;politically exposed person.&#8221; While the law defines such people as &#8220;current or former foreign political figures, their immediate family and their close associates,&#8221; several banking officials at major institutions said that as a matter of practice, they extend extra scrutiny to American political figures.</p></blockquote>
<p>911 has become a new tool for checking on your enemies, enemies abroad and enemies domestic&#8230;and I emphasize <i>domestic</i>.</p>
<p>Do you have a domestic, non-terrorist enemy? Well, we at the OCC have just the tool for you.</p>
<p>I could make the argument for prostitution. There are familial situations where it might be acceptable. On hearing about the Spitzer scandal, my wife, a Canadian, so argued. She explained to me the condition of endometriosis, as one situation. I had never heard of it. I had to Google it. Nonetheless, I was surprised at her defense of Spitzer. (And, &#8220;No, I have never visited a prostitute!&#8221; Personally&#8230;and this is only personal&#8230;.I do not insist others hold to this value&#8230;.I find the idea of prostitution repugnant.)</p>
<p>Like me, she believes people&#8217;s personal lives are theirs alone. Both of us do not judge on that score. Consenting adults is our rule of thumb.</p>
<p>But America has foolishly chosen to make sex and the bedroom a matter of national policy. We have also chosen, alas, to spy on every unusual domestic financial transaction. Did you move an unusual amount of money today? Did you say something on the phone or in an email that might reveal hmmmm a lack of patriotism? Rest assured, it will be reported. 911 has become the excuse for Big Brother to peer everywhere, into every life, into every blog, into every bedroom.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I do judge Spitzer on his hypocrisy, his arrogance, and his stupidity.</p>
<p>He knew the rules of the road better than anyone. If he was going to lead the charge against serious white-collar corruption, he should have acted accordingly. If he were in a different country&#8230;.</p>
<p>What interests me more than Spitzer&#8217;s stupidity is the battle now being waged over responsibility for the financial carnage taking place before our eyes. Sex has muddied the waters, as usual. The OCC has claimed that its oversight has been stellar. Yet, the banks who brought down Spitzer were the banks under its charge, banks that have been deeply involved in predatory lending. The OCC&#8217;s hands are not clean in this matter, regardless of their press releases.</p>
<p>In our 911 zeal, we have handed oversight to officials who have special interests of their own. In our 911 zeal, we have given officials with special interests of their own carte blanche into peering into every corner of our lives. Richard Nixon would have been proud. They use fear of 911 to attack their enemies&#8230;and we have given them the tools with which to do it.</p>
<p>Even if their counter attack is justifiable&#8211;as in the case of Spitzer&#8211;, it nonetheless is a political weapon. Real accountability becomes confused and lost.</p>
<p>And here we are, struggling to stave off a financial meltdown, unable to hold anyone accountable. It will take a great deal of honest reflection to set this country aright once more.</p>

                                <p>When Rdan reorganized the AB site, the blogroll was broken up into categories.  If you want to know why we&#8217;ve classified Cafe Hayek under the &#8220;at war with data&#8221; category, read <a href="http://cafehayek.typepad.com/hayek/2008/03/theory-and-evid.html">this post and the comments</a>.  (Don&#8217;t forget the comments!)</p>
<p>Essentially, we are told that:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was asked the other day by a reporter if NAFTA had been a good thing or a bad thing for America. I said that both the proponents and opponents of NAFTA had no legitimate, unassailable or even suggestive, statistical evidence on their side. I said it was absurd to think that in a $14 trillion economy, you could tease out the impact of increased trade with Mexico and Canada and disentangle it from the thousands of other changes going on.</p>
<p>I suggested that anyone who provided an empirical case for or against the agreement was essentially being dishonest&#8211;using statistics selectively to make the case for a pre-existing world-view.</p>
<p>The reporter found this viewpoint unacceptable. Surely, he said, economics can help us answer the question of whether NAFTA has been good for America or bad. Or at least good or bad, for say Ohio.</p>
<p>I said no, there was no empirical evidence that would be decisive. It isn&#8217;t just that it&#8217;s hard to measure the net impact precisely. I argued that it can&#8217;t be measured.</p>
<p>He refused to accept this answer. Surely I could answer the question of NAFTA&#8217;s worth. I was just ducking the question.</p>
<p>I said, no, I wasn&#8217;t ducking the question. I was answering the question. He just didn&#8217;t like my answer.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>There appears to be no relationship between the number of jobs in America (or in Ohio for that matter) and the trade deficit or increased productivity.</p>
<p>But the opponents of technology or trade could argue that the failure to observe a negative correlation between jobs and technology or jobs and trade deficits is spurious. True, the number of jobs in America has grown while technology has gotten better and better. But if we hadn&#8217;t had technology we&#8217;d have even more jobs. So we have to control for the other factors that might have made jobs increase rather than decrease.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s very hard to do. I&#8217;d settle for hearing a list of the factors that might plausibly be offsetting the alleged effects of trade and technology. In the absence of that list, I&#8217;m pretty comfortable arguing that trade deficits and technology have little effect on the total number of jobs (rather than the number of jobs in particular industries). And the reason I feel that way is partly because of the total number of jobs rising but mainly, I suspect, because I have a belief about how the world works.</p>
<p>I use the word &#8220;belief&#8221; which might lead some to dismiss my views as simply a matter of ideology. But my faith in my view of how the world works has empirical support for its tenets. It&#8217;s not just a fantasy or a dogma or convenient. I just don&#8217;t have holistic empirical evidence on trade having no impact on the number of jobs.</p>
<p>My view of the world is that when we widen the ability of our fellow citizens and ourselves to trade with people other than just our own kind or nationality or religion or color, that that in turn allows trade to take place more productively. That in turn creates wealth, a higher standard of living. And that in turn creates new opportunities for employment that come along and replace the old.</p>
<p>This view of the world is supported by logic and lots of empirical evidence. But again, it&#8217;s not the empirical evidence of an overarching kind that let&#8217;s me evaluate one corner of increased specialization, say the overall impact of NAFTA.</p></blockquote>
<p>I happen to believe that NAFTA was a good thing for the US (and for Mexico and for Canada) overall.  That isn&#8217;t to say I don&#8217;t its had some big negative impacts as well, and that those impacts have been borne disproportionately by some groups.</p>
<p>That said, despite having an opinion, I haven&#8217;t made an attempt to actually measure its impact, which may explain why I haven&#8217;t written a post about it.  One has limits to time and resources, and right now I&#8217;m doing other things.  </p>
<p>But, here&#8217;s the thing: I believe with a bit of time and a bit of data I could come up with something of a measure of its effects, positive and negative.  And I don&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m unique in that regard &#8211; if I can do it, so can a bunch of other people.  Now, whether other people choose to do it or not, I don&#8217;t know, but to insist the effects of making a change to something  (i.e., terms of trade) for which reams of data is available is unknowable seems ludicrous to me. I believe in what I believe either because measurement tells me it is true, or because it is similar to something else that measurement has told me is true.  And if I believe something, and I measure it, and the measurement contradicts my belief.. well, I might measure again, and again, but by then the measurement will no longer contradict my belief because my belief will have changed to match the measurement.</p>
<p>One thing I&#8217;ve noticed about the Austrian school&#8230;  they keep talking about empirical evidence for things like this and that on a large scale, as does Russ Roberts in the piece to which I linked, but they don&#8217;t really seem to present much of that purported evidence for anything.  </p>
<p>FWIW, the comments to the post are also great.  Here&#8217;s the first one by someone called Sam Grove:</p>
<blockquote><p>That sounds about right.</p>
<p>And libertarians are thought to be simplistic when we can&#8217;t produce such evidence. Inquiring minds want to know exactly what&#8217;s going on. How else will the politicians and bureaucrats know how to perfect policies?</p></blockquote>
<p>Most of them are like this.  My favorite is this gem by someone called Jacob:</p>
<blockquote><p>Russell, brilliant post.</p>
<p>This post seems to me to display how economics cannot possibly rely upon &#8217;empirical evidence&#8217; to create theory. How can one economist think that the New Deal was the best thing ever for the economy while another think it was the worst? Everyone can drum up a few statistics to support their case.</p>
<p>It is the theory that tells you what statistics to look at. There cannot possibly be an empirical basis for any economic theory.</p></blockquote>
<p>Everything about this is wrong to me.  All economic theory derives at some point from theory.  What exactly does this guy think Adam Smith was doing when he wrote Wealth of Nations, describing the world around him as best he could or describing a fevered dreamscape?</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Let’s give President Bush a little credit for something he was very careful about back in late 2001.  When we decided it was high time to remove the Taliban from power after Osama bin Laden launched the 9/11 attacks, our government was very careful not to use terms like Crusade for what should be rather obvious reasons.  I bring this up in light of something <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/washington_dispatch/2008/03/john-mccain-rod-parsley-spiritual-guide.html">David Corn</a> reported:</p>
<blockquote><p>Senator John McCain hailed as a spiritual adviser an Ohio megachurch pastor who has called upon Christians to wage a &#8220;war&#8221; against the &#8220;false religion&#8221; of Islam with the aim of destroying it … The leader of a 12,000-member congregation, Parsley has written several books outlining his fundamentalist religious outlook, including the 2005 Silent No More. In this work, Parsley decries the &#8220;spiritual desperation&#8221; of the United States, and he blasts away at the usual suspects: activist judges, civil libertarians who advocate the separation of church and state, the homosexual &#8220;culture&#8221; (&#8220;homosexuals are anything but happy and carefree&#8221;), the &#8220;abortion industry,&#8221; and the crass and profane entertainment industry. And Parsley targets another profound threat to the United States: the religion of Islam. In a chapter titled &#8220;Islam: The Deception of Allah,&#8221; Parsley warns there is a &#8220;war between Islam and Christian civilization.&#8221; He continues:</p>
<p><em>I cannot tell you how important it is that we understand the true nature of Islam, that we see it for what it really is. In fact, I will tell you this: I do not believe our country can truly fulfill its divine purpose until we understand our historical conflict with Islam. I know that this statement sounds extreme, but I do not shrink from its implications. The fact is that America was founded, in part, with the intention of seeing this false religion destroyed, and I believe September 11, 2001, was a generational call to arms that we can no longer ignore.</em></p>
<p>Parsley is not shy about his desire to obliterate Islam. In Silent No More, he notes—approvingly—that Christopher Columbus shared the same goal: &#8220;It was to defeat Islam, among other dreams, that Christopher Columbus sailed to the New World in 1492…Columbus dreamed of defeating the armies of Islam with the armies of Europe made mighty by the wealth of the New World. It was this dream that, in part, began America.&#8221; He urges his readers to realize that a confrontation between Christianity and Islam is unavoidable:  &#8220;We find now we have no choice. The time has come.&#8221; And he has bad news: &#8220;We may already be losing the battle. As I scan the world, I find that Islam is responsible for more pain, more bloodshed, and more devastation than nearly any other force on earth at this moment.&#8221; Parsley claims that Islam is an &#8220;anti-Christ religion&#8221; predicated on &#8220;deception.&#8221; The Muslim prophet Muhammad, he writes, &#8220;received revelations from demons and not from the true God.&#8221; And he emphasizes this point: &#8220;Allah was a demon spirit.&#8221; Parsley does not differentiate between violent Islamic extremists and other followers of the religion:</p>
<p><em>There are some, of course, who will say that the violence I cite is the exception and not the rule. I beg to differ. I will counter, respectfully, that what some call &#8220;extremists&#8221; are instead mainstream believers who are drawing from the well at the very heart of Islam.</em></p>
<p>The spirit of Islam, he maintains, is one of hostility. He asserts that the religion &#8220;inspired&#8221; the 9/11 attacks. He bemoans the fact that in the years after 9/11, 34,000 Americans &#8220;have become Muslim&#8221; and that there are &#8220;some 1,209 mosques&#8221; in America. Islam, he declares, is a &#8220;faith that fully intends to conquer the world&#8221; through violence. The United States, he insists, &#8220;has historically understood herself as a bastion against Islam,&#8221; but &#8220;history is crashing in upon us.&#8221; At the end of his chapter on Islam, Parsley asks, &#8220;Are we a Christian nation? I say yes.&#8221; Without specifying what actions should be taken to eradicate the religion, he essentially calls for a new crusade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Corn contends that McCain courts the support of Parsley hoping to garner strong support from certain “Christian fundamentalist voters”.  Fine – let McCain court their vote while those of us who desire a return to sanity in foreign policy should vote for anyone else besides McCain.  It’s a shame that the GOP does not listen to Ron Paul on these matters.</p>

                                <p>I have long maintained that Lawrence Kudlow could be bashing the FED for overly tight monetary policy on Tuesday and then turn around and bash the FED for overly expansionary monetary policy by Thursday.  It seems his guest on his <a href="http://kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/2008/03/fed-to-rescue-game-changer-or-one-day.html">Tuesday show</a> were all elated at the recent FED moves.  It was not too long ago that Kudlow was for a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/kudlow-on-reagans-strong-dollar-policy_04.html">strong dollar policy</a> that included a tighter monetary policy.  I’m tempted to say that Kudlow’s incessant flip-flopping on this topic is the height of mendacity.  But then I have to wonder if he even knows how inconsistent his various pieces of FED bashing really are.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.williampolley.com/blog/">William Polley</a> wonders out loud as well:</p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2008/03/11/the-fed-may-run-low-on-unconventional-ammo/">WSJ Real Time Economics Blog</a> opens a post with this:</p>
<p>&#8220;Back in 2003, when the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to 1%, the world worried that the Fed was running out of ammunition and would soon have to turn to unconventional tools.</p>
<p>Now, in 2008, it’s worth asking if the Fed could run out of unconventional ammunition. Tuesday’s offer to lend $200 billion of its Treasury holdings to primary dealers in return for mortgage-backed securities both guaranteed by the government-sponsored enterprises (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac) and not (private-label MBS) means it will have eventually sold or pledged half of its Treasurys, limiting how many more of these tricks it can pull off.&#8221;</p>
<p>My first thought when I heard about this innovative move the Fed was that it would take the pressure off for a few days&#8211;maybe a week or two. And what then?</p></blockquote>

<p>We also will be seeing municipal problems in Cleveland and Detroit to name a few, although as save the rusbelt points out these cities have been ignored to some degree.</p>

                                <p>Someone&#8217;s got to say it, and nobody is, so I will:  all three remaining presidential candidates are jokes.  Bad jokes.  That isn&#8217;t to say there were good candidates in the race earlier on &#8211; perhaps these three really are the best of a bad lot &#8211; but let&#8217;s call it like it is and note that these are three turkeys.  They may be good campaigners, but they don&#8217;t seem to be &#8220;do-ers&#8221; when they get what they&#8217;ve been campaigning for.</p>
<p>McCain is a a guy who one day admits he doesn&#8217;t have any idea how the economy works, and the next day claims otherwise while proving he doesn&#8217;t have any idea how the economy works.  He has a temper, is somewhat mentally unstable, and is kowtowing to the folks who made him their bitch eight years ago, which says something about his level of self-respect.  The only reason anyone has ever heard of McCain is because his father and grandfather were Admirals.  His own primary claim to fame was being a POW.  I feel bad for the guy &#8211; I can only imagine how bad it must have been to be a POW, but being the survivor of a horrific experience is not a reason to trust a guy with public office. </p>
<p>As to his personality issues, he seems to fly off the handle easily, and its no secret the guy was having a affair with the woman who would become his second wife while still married to his first.  (In the birds of a feather department, that second wife has also admitted to, ahem, <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/10/18/drugs/">defrauding a charity to support her drug habit</a>.) </p>
<p>What about Hillary?  (Full disclosure &#8211; I cast my vote for her in the primaries, though I had so many clothespins on my nose when I did it that I was in pain for a week.)  Obviously, she&#8217;d have no political career at all if it wasn&#8217;t for the Big Dawg, much less moving to a state she never lived in and immediately becoming senator.  (WTF was that about?)   And still, she apparently isn&#8217;t smart enough or has too much of an ego to run on the slogan &#8220;Bringing Bill Back Into the White House&#8221; &#8211; despite a very recent, successful <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cristina_Fern%C3%A1ndez_de_Kirchner">example</a>.  I won&#8217;t rehash her other negatives &#8211; she has plenty, real and imaginary.  (And imaginary negatives are real too, because if enough people believe &#8217;em, they must be overcome.) </p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Obama.  He does give a good speech.  But I&#8217;ve listened to a speech or two of his, and I noticed that he doesn&#8217;t actually say anything.  The one thing he seems to have a bit to say about is Social Security, and there he&#8217;s pretty much bought into Republican talking points. </p>
<p>All three are senators, but&#8230;   what have they done in the Senate?  Hilary and Obama , from what I can tell, have done nothing.  Sure, they have the excuse of not having been in the Senate long, but since being in the Senate is the summit of their career so far, it isn&#8217;t exactly a glowing recommendation for President.  Coincidentally, McCain, who has been in the Senate a long time, has also done very, very little.  I can think of two things:  McCain Feingold and the whole Keating Five affair. </p>
<p>Now, its always possible one of these folks would make a good president.  You never know.  But I&#8217;m not betting on it.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.stopatmfees.com/occmore.htm">This site</a> dedicated to OCC watching offers a little background for us in the changes being made with banking rules.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>In January, 2004 the OCC issued two related and sweeping rules, one preempting nearly all state and local consumer laws (the <a href="http://www.pirg.org/consumer/pdfs/preemption.pdf">&#8220;preemption rule&#8221;</a>) [69 Fed. Reg. 1904 (2004)] and the other restricting nearly all enforcement powers of state regulators and attorneys general (the <a href="http://www.pirg.org/consumer/pdfs/visitorial.pdf">&#8220;visitorial powers rule.&#8221;</a>) [69 Fed. Reg. 1895 (2004)] over national banks, and incredibly, their state-licensed operating subsidiaries, which are not banks.<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>The issuance of the OCC rules has sparked a bi-partisan storm of protest from state legislatures, state financial regulators and state attorneys general. The attorneys general particularly criticized the OCC&#8217;outrageous characterization that the &#8220;National Bank Act protect[s] national banks from potential state hostility&#8230;&#8221; Calling the states &#8220;hostile&#8221; does not advance any legitimate argument. See the OCC Watch Coalition Partner Links page for more information.</p>
<p>Even the normally complacent House Financial Services Committee has weighed in. In addition to holding OCC oversight hearings, it has passed a <a href="http://financialservices.house.gov/media/pdf/022504bvam2.pdf">bi-partisan budget resolution</a> on a vote of 34-28 stating that the OCC action &#8220;may represent an unprecedented expansion of Federal preemption authority&#8221; and &#8220;comes without congressional authorization, and without a corresponding increase in budget resources for the agency.&#8221; The committee also pointed out that without a budget increase, the OCC cannot really expect its modest staff of 40 consumer complaint specialists and approximately 100 examiners to both continue their own work and also take over much of the work of an estimated 700 state consumer enforcers and examiners. &#8220;In the area of abusive mortgage lending practices alone, State bank supervisory agencies initiated 20,332 investigations in 2003 in response to consumer complaints, which resulted in 4,035 enforcement actions&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Two points to be made:<br />1. The size of the department makes regulation moot given the responsibilities.<br />2. The national bank is not subject to state regulations, but also the <em>state subsidiaries of that bank.</em></p>
<p>Since the trend is not new but was accelerated since after 2000, would state regulation have been able to help with the bank situation? Is the lack of staff with huge increases in responsibility another way to lessen regulatory effectiveness? Was that the intent? And how does that square with the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/spitzer-and-occ-who-you-gonna-call.html">press release by the OCC here</a>?</p>
<p>Step by step information to be had&#8230;.there are two lists compare. Perhaps a call to each state AG could obtain more information. If you call in CA, make sure to mention cactus&#8217;s problem.</p>
