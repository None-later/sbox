<blockquote><p>Progressives usually fight for the interests of those at the middle and bottom at the expense of those on top. However, during this period of unprecedented financial crisis, when the Wall Street rich are begging for the helping hand of the government, most progressives appear to be on the sidelines. Rather than taking advantage of this extraordinary opportunity to reduce inequality and educate the public about how the economy really works, progressive voices have been unusually quiet.<br />    While the basic story on the economic crisis should be well known, it is nonetheless worth repeating. The Federal Reserve Board allowed the growth of an $8 trillion housing bubble ($110,000 of housing bubble wealth for every homeowner) in the years from 1996 to 2006. While this bubble was easily recognizable to competent <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/publications/reports/the-run-up-in-home-prices-is-it-real-or-is-it-another-bubble/" target="_blank">economists</a>, the entire political and financial establishments managed to ignore the housing bubble until it began to burst last year.<br /><strong>&#8230;<br /></strong><br />     As an alternative to bailing out the banks, we can temporarily change the rules on foreclosure to give homeowners the right to rent at the fair market <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/op-eds-columns/op-eds-columns/the-subprime-borrower-protection-plan/" target="_blank">rate</a>. This would provide them with security in their home. More importantly, it would likely create a situation where most homeowners stay in their house as owners, since banks would rather renegotiate mortgage terms than end up as landlords.<br />    The Wall Street boys got themselves in a huge mess through their own greed and stupidity. Now is the time to make sure they enjoy the fruits of their labor. These are the same people who don&#8217;t think they should have to pay higher taxes so kids can get health care and childcare. There is no reason the rest of us should pay higher taxes so they can keep their mansions in the Hamptons, their private jets and retinue of personal services. Let&#8217;s leave this one to the market.</p></blockquote>

<p>Digging Out of the Recession<br />by Peter Morici</p>
<p>The U.S. economy is in recession with no end in sight. Falling housing prices are blamed, but the root causes are bad economic policies and lousy banking practices.</p>
<p>U.S. imports exceed exports by more than $700 billion, thanks mostly to expensive oil and lopsided commerce with China. To finance this gap, Americans sell bonds and other securities to foreigners, and Wall Street banks, like Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, recycle those funds to American consumers.</p>
<p>U.S. consumers borrow from mortgage companies, local banks and finance companies through mortgages, auto loans and credit cards. Those firms sell the loans to Wall Street banks, who bundle loans into bonds for sale to big fixed income investors. The Chinese government, Middle East royals and other foreign investors purchase huge sums of such U.S. interest bearing securities.</p>
<p>Last year, this scheme started coming unglued, because many homeowners borrowed more than their paychecks and home values could support. Loan officers encouraged home buyers to exaggerate incomes on mortgage applications and hired real estate appraisers that would inflate home values. Wall Street disguised bad loans in complex derivatives, instead of creating simple bonds, which fooled fixed income investors into believing they were buying securities backed by solid loans. Other rouses propagated like aggressive adjustable rate mortgages, and bogus credit default swaps alleged to make risks disappear.</p>
<p>When the worst bonds failed—those backed by subprime adjustable rate mortgages—the fixed income market closed to U.S. banks.</p>
<p>Banks don’t have enough deposits to make all the loans the U.S. economy needs, because Americans increasingly by-pass banks, investing directly in mutual funds, retirement accounts and the like. Hence, banks must turn about half of their loans into bonds.</p>
<p>Now investors, ranging from U.S. insurance companies to foreign investors, are not willing to buy bonds from U.S. banks, and banks cannot make enough loans to credit-worthy homebuyers, consumers and businesses. Housing prices plummet, car sales sink, businesses can’t invest, and the economy tanks into recession.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve has cut interest rates and temporarily loaned banks $600 billion dollars, but those steps help little because the bond market is closed to banks.</p>
<p>Moreover, foreign investors are getting nervous about all the money they have loaned Americans to finance huge trade deficits. They are fleeing the dollar by moving cash into euro denominated securities, gold, oil, and other investments.</p>
<p>Fixing the trade deficit will require Americans to use less gasoline and balance commerce with China. Americans must either let the price of gas double to force conservation or accept tougher mileage standards cars. Fifty miles a gallon by 2020, instead of the 35 required by current law, is achievable, but that means more hybrids and lighter vehicles.</p>
<p>China subsidizes exports by selling its currency, the yuan, for dollars at artificially low values in foreign exchange markets, making Chinese goods artificially cheap at Wal-Mart. The U.S. government should tax dollar-yuan conversions at a rate equal to China’s subsidy until China stops manipulating currency markets. That would reduce imports from, and increase exports to, China.</p>
<p>Finally, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke are working to clean up the practices of mortgage brokers, loan officers and real estate appraisers but Wall Street banks must be willing to create simple bonds from mortgages and other loans that investors can understand and whose risks can be reasonably accessed. This is less profitable than the complex bonds and derivatives that were sold prior to the subprime meltdown.</p>
<p>Paulson and Bernanke should bring together the largest banks and fixed income investors, among insurance companies and the like, to lay out the requirements for such bonds and require the banks to stick to them.</p>
<p>Banks may resist, because plain vanilla mortgage underwriting doesn’t pay outsized fees and bonuses they have been spoiled to expect from complex derivatives. However, Americans need the banks to make mortgages and other loans to get the economy back on track, and Bernanke and Paulson have the leverage to bring them to the table—the $600 billion the Federal Reserve is loaning banks to keep them afloat.</p>
<p>It’s time to get realistic about using less oil and tough with China and the banks.</p>

<p>One of my interests is Global Warming. While visiting the many global warming sites I noticed that many of the questions had to do with finding the latest data and comments. Googling I found that there appeared to be very few sites that consolidate this kind of information. So, in an effort to help solve this problem I am starting <a href="http://www.globalwarmingclearinghouse.blogspot.com/">Global Warming Clearinghouse</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any suggestions, recommendations or preferred sources leave a comment at corev@comcast.net or <a href="http://www.globalwarmingclearinghouse.blogspot.com/">GWC</a>.<br />&#8230;&#8230;..</p>
<p>rdan here &#8211; This is a daunting task both from the variety of sciences involved, old versus new data, hyperbole written to date, and deciding what is &#8220;balanced&#8221;. However, it appeared it could be a way to start on a site dedicated to the topic. I had thoughts but will leave them in comments.</p>

                                <p>It seems <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/24/opinion/24bartlett.html?ex=1364097600&#038;en=f788f747316575f5&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink">Bruce</a> never liked the tax rebate proposal for similar reasons that several others include <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/01/fiscal-stimulus-little-bang-for-buck.html">me</a> expressed: </p>
<blockquote><p>Despite the bipartisan support for the rebate, few economists have supported the idea. They note that we have tried rebates in the past — most recently in 2001 — and there is no evidence that they have meaningfully stimulated either consumption or growth. By and large, people saved the money they received or paid bills (which is the same thing); very few used their rebates to increase spending.  The true reason why the current rebate has been so popular in Washington is that giving away free money in an election year is good for politicians of both parties</p></blockquote>
<p>.</p>
<p>Bruce updates that old discussion noting what has changed in terms of the economic picture and proposes an alternative means for using fiscal stimulus:</p>
<blockquote><p>But in the almost six weeks since the rebate legislation was signed into law, the economic situation has changed. The meltdown in financial markets is much more serious than it looked in February. At its root are bad mortgages and other debts that are like toxic waste spreading throughout the financial system. The solution, therefore, is not to drop $100 bills from helicopters — which is essentially what the rebate would do. Rather, what we need is a mortgage Superfund that can clean up the toxic waste. If we can cleanse the financial system of at least some of the bad debts, it will do far more to restore the economy to health than anything that could be accomplished by the rebate — even if the rebate were to work as it is supposed to.We all know that the government is eventually going to get stuck with a lot of the bad debts, just as it did in the early 1990s when a previous housing bubble burst and bankrupt savings and loans had to be rescued. That bailout cost taxpayers $160 billion. The next one will probably cost more because the problem is bigger and the economy is larger.  At the same time, there are increasing demands for targeted relief for homeowners facing foreclosure. It looks to many people as if Washington cares more about fat-cat bankers than working families in hard times. At some point, Congress is going to respond with additional aid for people caught in the mortgage mess, and this relief will come on top of the $117 billion cost of the rebate. We need to stop and ask whether we can afford to spend $117 billion that the Treasury Department does not have on a program of dubious effectiveness. It simply makes no sense to send out checks to people who have no need for it as some kind of election-year bribe to vote for incumbents of both parties. That money would go a long way toward cleaning up the mortgages that are poisoning the financial sector. Congress should immediately repeal the rebate and redirect the money that has been budgeted into a package of measures that would help the housing sector and those people who actually need assistance. The Treasury might use some of the money, for example, to enable Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-sponsored housing agencies, to buy up some of the bad mortgages, get them off bank balance sheets and help homeowners refinance them.</p></blockquote>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>To follow up my post on this  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/question-forabout-conservatives-and.html">recession</a>, I&#8217;d like to note something else that&#8217;s kind of odd about the recession.  Regular readers know I think the Fed is often at least partly at fault for recessions when we get them.  (I&#8217;ll be backing up this claim with data below, don&#8217;t worry.)   That doesn&#8217;t seem to be true here.  Sure, the Fed helped create conditions that led to the asset bubble&#8230;  but it wasn&#8217;t involved in the conditions that led to the end of that bubble at this time, nor did it excessively tighten money.</p>
<p>OK.  Let&#8217;s go to the data.  Take <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/hist/h6hist1.txt">Seasonally Adjusted M1</a> (which goes back to 1959), and adjust it for <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">inflation</a>.  You&#8217;ll note that real M1 has been shrinking over time &#8211; cash has been getting less important over time.   No surprise &#8211; in the last few decades, we&#8217;ve had the evolution of plenty of new methods of paying for transactions or saving, from checks to credit cards to shares of stock and exotic derivatives&#8230;</p>
<p>Between 1959 and 2007, there were a total of 588 months.  94 of those were spent in recession, or 16% of the time.  If you consider recessions plus the twelve months before a recession, that&#8217;s 30.3% of the time.  (Of course, I&#8217;m using the recession dates provided by the <a href="http://www.nber.org/">NBER</a>.  Also, the data and analysis used in this post can be found <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILjx7HMk-qBYKQ">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Now, there are 28 instances in which the Fed dropped real M1 by at least 3.5% from where it had been three months later.  (Interestingly, it often happens in March&#8230; presumably, its good to have a lot of money sloshing around at the end of the year during Christmas season.)</p>
<p>Now, here&#8217;s the cool thing&#8230;. 17 of the 28 months where we observed a decrease of 3.5% or more from the month 3 months prior, or 61% of them, occur either during a recession or within twelve months prior to a recession.  Another cool thing&#8230;  there are seven recessions during this period, and every single one of them begins no more than 12 months after a time we observe a 3.5% decrease in real M1.  Every single one.  Its hard to conclude a big drop in real M1 doesn&#8217;t have something to do with recessions, both getting us into them and keeping us in them.  Not all periods where we see such a drop are associated with recessions, but we&#8217;ll look at that in a moment.</p>
<p>Of these 28 instances in which the Fed drops real M1 by at least 3.5% in a 3 month period, Dems are in the Oval Office 15 of them, of about 54% of the time (Note that the President is a Republican 59% of the months in the sample as a whole&#8230; so we clearly aren&#8217;t seeing these big decreases in real M1 being randomly distributed.)</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s another interesting factette&#8230; what about those cases where we see this big cut in real M1 but don&#8217;t see a recession follow?   It turns out that happens eleven times&#8230;  and in eight cases there&#8217;s a Democrat in office. </p>
<p>So in terms of politics&#8230; what we see is that the Fed is much more likely to cut real M1 by a lot when there&#8217;s a Dem in office, and the economy has been much, much more likely to make it through such a cut in real M1 without suffering a recession when a Dem is in office.  The end result, of course, is that the percentage of time that the economy is in recession when the President is a Republican is much higher than the percentage of time that the economy is in recession when the President is a Democrat.</p>
<p>Now, back to the current mess&#8230;  since every single one of the seven previous recessions for which we can compute real M1 using data on the Fed&#8217;s website was preceded by a cut of 3.5% or more in the three month real M1, the natural question is&#8230;.  is that true this time too?  As with many things involving GW, the answer is&#8230; No.  If there&#8217;s one recession that wasn&#8217;t at last partly triggered by the Fed, this one is it.</p>
<p>Which leads to my question from yesterday&#8217;s post, yet again &#8211; why are we seeing a recession now, at this time, so soon after the last one.  The last time we see a recession so soon after the previous one, Reagan was in office.  The last time we saw a President with two recessions in his term, Nixon was in office.  Unless the last few decades have been a major aberration, an ordinary business cycle shouldn&#8217;t be bringing us to a recession so soon.  So to repeat:  why are we seeing a recession now, given that GW has gotten everything he&#8217;s wanted &#8211; tax cuts, help from the Fed, reduced regulation, even two wars (and remember &#8211; Conservatives and libertarians credit WW2 with ending the recession, not FDR)?  Could the conservative or libertarian model have predicted such a thing?  </p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/032308B.shtml">The Washington Post</a> reports on recent GAO congressional testimony about a basic security concern.</p>
<blockquote><p>Government agencies have a long way to go before they can assure taxpayers that the country&#8217;s secrets &#8211; as well as citizens&#8217; personal information &#8211; are secure, according to recent government reports.<br />    In fact, the Government Accountability Office testified to Congress last week that &#8220;poor information security is a widespread problem with potentially devastating consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>    Among the potential concerns that the GAO identified in testimony to a Senate subcommittee: If systems aren&#8217;t secure, sensitive information, such as taxpayer data, Social Security records and medical records, could be &#8220;inappropriately disclosed, browsed or copied for improper or criminal purposes.&#8221;</p>
<p>    As in the breach of three presidential candidates&#8217; passport files, the use of outside contractors has been cited as a possible problem by the GAO and other government investigators.</p>
<p>    In a 2005 report, the GAO found that most government agencies have security policies on the books and written in contracts with outside vendors. But those policies often didn&#8217;t go far enough to properly oversee the work of those contractors, the GAO said.</p>
<p>    In the recent GAO testimony, investigators found that the percentage of employees and outside contractors receiving security-awareness training had dropped from 2006 to 2007.</p></blockquote>
<p>These issues are complex, but these issues are not new either.  On the one hand we have growing and sophisticated total awareness sort of programs for gathering information on US citizens, but pay inadequate attention to information we already have.</p>
<p>And there is less training for security awareness, what ever that means.  The state of the White House systems concerning communication sounds simply primitive, and at least from indifference.  How does that continue for decades?</p>

<blockquote><p>AT LEAST KRUGMAN ADMITS IT&#8217;S EVIL&#8230;   &#8230;to be happy that Bear Stearns has been wiped out because their chief economist is a conservative. What a narcissistic rat</p></blockquote>
<p>The person who worked for Bear Sterns pretending to be an economist is David Malpass.  Krugman wasn’t saying Malpass writes conservative material – he was saying a lot of what Malpass has written is nonsense as in stupid.  Leave it to Donald Luskin not to know the difference.</p>

<p>Think back to January of 2001.  Say you told any conservative or libertarian that there would be what the White House refers to as a <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/lazear20060912.html">&#8220;mild recession&#8221;</a> later that year.  Say you also told that conservative or libertarian that by the beginning of 2008, the economy would have enjoyed years of tax cuts, years of cheap money coupled with low inflation, years of reduced regulation, and a couple (semi-privatized) small wars.  Would they have predicted that along the way, real growth would be sub-par, and right now we&#8217;d be facing the possibility of a major downturn?  Could they have even accepted that combination of facts?  Is what we&#8217;re seeing a feasible outcome of any conservative or libertarian model?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/2008/03/was-bear-stearns-sacrificial-lamb.html">Lawrence Kudlow</a> is not happy that Bear Sterns was purchased by JP Morgan:</p>
<blockquote><p>Did Bear Stearns really need to go down in flames? It’s a question that needs to be asked, and my answer is no.  Of course, I don’t know the value of Bear Stearns’s assets, and whether they could have served as collateral for private or government loans … Watching the venerable old firm pawned off to JPMorgan Chase for a couple hundred million bucks &#8211; basically a bag of peanuts &#8211; is painful to me. The building itself is worth at least $1.5 billion … The fact is, Bear shareholders got creamed with the $2 per share purchase price. The shareholders include all the men and women who’ve worked there for years, and who own roughly one-third of the firm’s equity.</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument is very odd at several levels.  The day before this post, Kudlow praised the <a href="http://kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/2008/03/jp-morgan-chase-bear-stearns.html">merger</a>.  But even more odd is how Kudlow does not even get simple balance sheet accounting.  Let’s take a look at the book value of the assets and liabilities of Bear Sterns as of <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bs?s=BSC&#038;annual">November 30, 2007</a>.  Its total liabilities were over $383 billion.  While Bear Sterns had about $10 billion in PP&#038;E and other assets, most of its $395 billion in assets represented financial assets.  If the market value of these assets fell below 97 percent of the book value of these assets, then the value of liabilities would exceed the value of its assets.  Looking at the asset side of the balance sheet to access the market value of equity is incredibly stupid when a firm has extensive debt.</p>
