                                <div><a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08360.pdf">GAO</a> reviews a case study of using contractors side by side with government employees at CCE.</p>
<p>
<blockquote><a href="http://dccw.hqda.pentagon.mil/home/index.asp">CCE (Contracting Center of Exellence)</a> has relied on contractor contract specialists since it began hiring them in 2003. In August 2007, contractors—who work side by side and perform the same functions as their government counterparts—comprised <strong>42 percent of CCE’s </strong>contract specialists. CCE officials cited difficulties hiring and <em>retaining </em>government personnel in light of the competition from government and the private sector for this competency. While CCE officials said that they prefer to use government employees, they have not considered the appropriate balance of contractor versus government contract specialists. Furthermore, CCE has not addressed the need for more training of its government employees to strengthen their skills in conducting CCE’s increasingly more complex procurements.<br />Methods to mitigate the risks of using contractors have been mixed in effect. First, the <em>line separating contractor from government employee is blurry</em>, and contractors did not always clearly identify themselves as such when dealing with the public. Second, the potential for the work being done under a <em>personal services contract, which the Federal Acquisition Regulation generally prohibits </em>because of the government-contractor relationship it creates, was clearly present. While contractor managers retained control over matters such as approving leave requests, CCE took steps to further strengthen the management distinction between government and contractor employees based on GAO’s findings. Finally, risks of organizational and personal conflicts of interest were mitigated to some extent, but <em>in practice the government relies on individual contractor employees to identify potential conflicts. These types of risks must be mitigated to ensure that the government does not lose accountability over policy and program decisions.</em><br /><em>CCE is paying up to almost <strong>27 percent more </strong>for its contractor-provided contract specialists than for similarly graded government employees</em>. This comparison took into account government salary, benefits, and overhead and the loaded hourly labor rates paid to contractors. Our review of available résumés showed that six contractor employees supporting CCE in fiscal year 2007 had on average more contracting experience than CCE’s five recent government hires.<br />Despite CCE’s legal counsel’s concerns, <em>CCE has been inappropriately ordering contract specialists under a GSA contract because the services were out of scope of those contracts. GAO found additional problems, such as a contractor advertising contract specialist services on GSA’s Web site that it was not authorized to provide.</em> Due to what it characterizes as the growing demand by federal agencies for contractor contract specialists, GSA recently posted a revised contract category, under which government agencies can procure contract specialists to provide acquisition management services, such as cost estimating and proposal evaluation support. In response to GAO’s findings, GSA contacted each of the contractors involved in our review about their out-of-scope services and plans further follow-ups with them.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Washington Post tried to scoop me&#8230;I readied the post yesterday. The thinking at CCE appears on the surface to mimic the OCC and John Dugan in method and intent.  But there are expert readers who can figure out the details.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08448.pdf">GAO report</a> (warning PDF file) is entitled:  Defense Acquisitions: Progress Made in Fielding Missile Defense, but Program Is Short of Meeting Goals.</p>
<p>The summary: </p>
<blockquote><p>On the other hand, it is difficult to assess how well BMDS (Ballistic Missile Defense System) is progressing relative to the funds it has received because fewer assets were fielded than originally planned, the cost of the block increased by at least $1 billion, some flight tests were deferred, and the performance of the fielded system remains unverified.</p></blockquote>
<p>The usual: cost overruns, delayed deliveries and stuff that does not perform. The Airbus tanker will be the same.</p>
<p>This is spending money for installing and maintaining defective, untested equipment missiles that don&#8217;t work launch on time like the space shuttle, the money will be spent twice in the future to fix the &#8220;unverified&#8221; performance.   &#8220;Unverified&#8221; is code for not meeting classified performance because the classified performance is hidden to protect the waste.</p>
<blockquote><p>Also making cost difficult to assess is a work planning method&#8211;referred to as &#8220;level of effort&#8221;&#8211;used by contractors that does not link time and money with what is produced. When not appropriately used, level-of-effort planning can obscure work accomplished, portending additional cost in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>Understated. Level of effort (LOE) is code for techie welfare.  LOE divorces expenses or inputs from results.  You use LOE when you either have no idea what you are going to get or you hire &#8220;kelly Girls&#8221; to sit around and collect money from the taxpayer. Good work if you can get it!! In LOE no one cares about &#8220;revenue product&#8221; of inputs marginal or otherwise, just the company&#8217;s revenue.</p>
<p>LOE in technology means there is no need that has a definite requirement nor any time table.</p>
<blockquote><p>GAO has previously reported that MDA (Missile Defense Agency) has been given unprecedented funding and decision-making flexibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>Enough funding and confidence artist&#8217;s flexibility to waste the money while preventing any effective oversight. Using level of effort all you get is &#8220;best effort&#8221;, like a kid going through college and failing every course and getting a job as rocket scientist. Do you expect it to work?</p>
<blockquote><p>Performance of the fielded system is as yet not verifiable because too few tests have been conducted to validate the models and simulations that predict BMDS performance. Moreover, the tests that are done do not provide enough information for DOD&#8217;s independent test organization to fully assess the BMDS&#8217; suitability and effectiveness.</p></blockquote>
<p>The tests done are not fielding tests as implied by the terms &#8220;suitability and effectiveness&#8221; which are tests done to justify &#8220;type designated&#8221; production; which is what the taxpayers would have ordered, the tests done here are tests of technology and have no relation to intercepting missiles.  But, the threat targets are missiles that do not exist, with WMD&#8217;s as existent as those in Baghdad in 2003.</p>
<p>This statement about &#8220;suitability and effectiveness&#8221; implies to me that GAO does not know what they are looking at or are covering up.</p>
<p>MDA has run a $200B con, and this is another way that national security must waste 4% of GDP.</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R-uPz0Ds2aI/AAAAAAAABBU/QbXRQlegU98/s1600-h/ai+-+return+on+assets.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R-uPz0Ds2aI/AAAAAAAABBU/QbXRQlegU98/s320/ai+-+return+on+assets.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>(I couldn&#8217;t find the data he used on the FDIC website to which he links, but AI has always been reliable so far so this should be accurate.)</p>
<p>And here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.irvinehousingblog.com/2008/03/25/inventory-panic/">scary quote from the Irvine Housing blog</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>We generally profile 4 or 5 properties a week, and lately the average loss has been $200,000 to $250,000. We are documenting $1,000,000 a week in lender losses. It it any wonder the banks are in trouble?</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/03/patterns.html">Menzie Chinn</a> wraps it all up:</p>
<blockquote><p>First methinks the Administration protests too much, about &#8220;not bailing out&#8221; investors. If it were indeed the case that it was against further contingent liabilities being taken on by the Federal government, it would not have allowed the increase in the maximum size of conforming loans guaranteed by the Government Sponsored Enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Nor would capital requirements have been reduced at exactly the time that a higher capital cushion would be in order, given the state of the economy. In addition, it would have taken some sort of action to limit the borrowing taking place through the Federal Home Loan Banks</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>So to me, it seems that the Administration is engaged upon a delaying action, and hoping to unload this problem upon the next Administration (an understandable, albeit less than fully public-minded, impulse). Meanwhile, it maintains the best &#8220;optics&#8221; in terms of making it look like it&#8217;s not taking on risks to government funds in order to help out financial firms. In so doing, it&#8217;s allowing an even bigger build-up of contingent liabilities, surreptitiously. But by virtue of being less transparent, it threatens to present a bigger, and more unpleasant, surprise for future policymakers (of either party).</p>
<p>Second, whatever the reasons for the Administration&#8217;s actions, I think a very serious problem is that, by virtue of the Administration&#8217;s abdication of a substantive role (see Hubbard&#8217;s comment on this point), the Fed is lending to entitites it does not regulate. The Bear Stearns collapse might have been seen as a case where the Fed had to undertake unconventional actions, because of the rapidity of developments. But with the Administration providing an uncompromising stance, who will step in the next episode? If it&#8217;s the Fed again, then Blinder&#8217;s critique will take on heightened relevance.</p></blockquote>

                                <blockquote><p><a href="http://www.occ.gov/toolkit/newsrelease.aspx?Doc=EYGNGGQ3.xml">Comptroller Dugan Underscores Bank Responsibility for Model Validation</a></p>
<p>WASHINGTON Feb. 3, 2006 – Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan said today that responsibility for validating the models banks use to manage credit risk and other critical activities lies first and foremost with the institution itself.</p>
<p>“Just as good management requires this kind of attention to one critical component of your success—your people—model validation takes on the same importance as part of sound management, as models become more central to the success of your organizations,” Mr. Dugan said in a speech at the OCC’s “Workshop on Validation of Credit Rating and Scoring Models.” “Organizations using these models need to be as sure as they can that models work as intended—that is, that the models are valid—much as they need to know that key people are doing their jobs.”</p>
<p><em>Comptroller Dugan said that regulators have the responsibility to establish clear expectations around model validation for the institutions they supervise, and then to ensure through the supervisory process that banks are meeting those expectations.</p>
<p>“This view—that banks validate, and supervisors supervise—is the OCC view of model validation, one we express consistently through our guidance and our supervisory processes,” Mr. Dugan said.  “But it is also a view shared by many other regulators, and a view that is becoming ever more prevalent as we share practices with our colleagues around the world.”</em></p>
<p><em>The Comptroller said he has been particularly impressed with the work done by the OCC’s Risk Analysis Division, which brings the knowledge and perspective of economists to the agency’s supervisory work.</em></p>
<p>“Whether it’s shifting through economic and industry trends <em>to spot emerging issues that the OCC needs to stay on top of, or evaluating the economic impact of policy proposals, or—as with this conference—addressing issues raised by banks’ use of quantitative models, the OCC’s economists bring a dimension to our supervisory work that is irreplaceable,” Mr. Dugan said. </em><br />“I’ve become increasingly proud of their capabilities and the contributions they make to our supervision of banks, which with nearly $6 trillion in assets engage increasingly in the kind of complex activities that require more sophisticated supervision.”</p>
<p>The interests of banks and regulators in validation do coincide in that both want models to work well, Mr. Dugan told the 400 modelers, regulators, economists, and other experts in attendance.  However, because regulators have different objectives and legal responsibilities from the private interests of banks, conflicting views occasionally occur about what should be done on modeling and validation, he said.</p>
<p>“When that happens—when the occasional but inevitable conflicts arise—we work very hard with our banks to reach an appropriate solution that works, consistent with our statutory responsibility to the public,” Comptroller Dugan said.</p>
<p>Mr. Dugan said that the OCC is keenly aware that individual banks are different and require different supervisory approaches to meet the same objectives and that supervision can’t be “one size fits all.”  A smaller, less complex bank needs a different supervisory approach than a diversified, multi-billion dollar organization, he noted.</p>
<p>“When it comes to supervision of banks’ use of models, at the OCC we believe that success requires recognition of the priority, and then seamless integration into the mainstream of bank supervision,” Comptroller Dugan said.  “Recognition of the priority begins at the top, and that includes me.”</p>
<p>OCC examiners draw on the advice of staff quantitative experts when they assess how a bank uses any quantitative model, the importance of that model within the business process, and the controls that surround and govern its use, he said.  “It’s a partnership, and one that works well.”</p>
<p>“Ultimately, the bottom-line judgment regarding the use of models and how they affect the condition and soundness of the bank rests where we firmly believe it should—in the hands of the examiners—but that judgment will have been the result of close collaboration between the examiners and the OCC’s quantitative modeling experts,” Comptroller Dugan said.</p>
<p>Mr. Dugan said that the new Basel II capital framework will add greater importance to sound validation practices.  Validation is likely to be an essential factor ensuring that models and other parts of banks’ internal processes used for Basel II meet the requirements for capital calculations, he said.</p>
<p>Comptroller Dugan cautioned that no model is perfect.  Every model relies on some key assumptions, reflecting a simplified view of the real world that never matches those assumptions perfectly.  That’s why model results can’t be blindly accepted as “the answer” on capital adequacy or anything else for that matter, he said.</p>
<p>“Models don’t build themselves, and they don’t validate themselves,” Mr. Dugan said.  “Validation is done by people, people who exercise judgment, judgment that can be good or can be bad.  This is part of the process, and will always be part of the process.”</p>
<p><strong>“If I can leave you with one primary thought, it’s that when your business depends on these models, good validation has to be viewed as part of sound management and good corporate governance,” Mr. Dugan concluded.  “And without good governance and management, we don’t have a prayer of having sound banks.”</strong> </p></blockquote>

<p>Good call, Mr. Dugan.  If I remember the novel by Ayn Rand correctly, what happens to bad managers?</p>

                                <p>Is this Sarbanes-Oxley redux? A replay of Enron, perhaps? <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/27/business/27account.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">New Century Financial</a>, the nation&#8217;s largest subprime lender, has been charged with fudging the books to show higher profits&#8230;all of which justified higher salaries and bonuses for those at the top. A five-month investigation said that<br />
<blockquote>
<p>investigators &#8220;did not find sufficient evidence to conclude that New Century engaged in earnings management or manipulation, although its accounting irregularities almost always resulted in increased earnings.&#8221; </p>
<p>Even so, the profits were the basis for significant executive bonuses and helped persuade Wall Street that the company was in fine health when in fact its business was coming apart, the report contends.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lead investigator, Mr. Missel,<br />
<blockquote>drew an analogy to Enron and said there was evidence that KPMG auditors had deferred excessively to New Century.</p></blockquote>
<p>Creative finance certainly has been a hallmark this decade.</p>
<p>As I noted earlier piece, expect complaints about onerous Sarbanes-Oxley because of an increase in foreign companies delisting from the New York Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>And keep a weather eye skyward for multi-million dollar parachutes.</p>

<blockquote><p>The real problem guys isn&#8217;t that the FED needs to save the banks or the economy goes caput.</p>
<p>The real problem is that maybe the FED doesn&#8217;t have enough ammunition to save the banks.</p>
<p>There are a lot of derivatives in the banks&#8217; books. While all mortgages&#8217; securities are currently caput (yes, all, with the house&#8217;s prices going down down down down, everyone is sub-prime, including those that are prime), soon we will see other derivatives (commercial estates, credit cards, etc) going caput too.</p>
<p>So, it is possible that FED will try everything possible and impossible and still fail, because the hole is a Black Hole.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cactus here.  I&#8217;m not at all sold on the idea that even if half the investment banks on Wall Street collapsed, we&#8217;d be in Great Depression-land.  But I do note this&#8230;  if the problem really is severe enough that the Fed cannot handle it, its best to let Wall Street melt to the ground.  See, what creates something resembling a South American country during the hyperinflation days is the public catching a whiff that there&#8217;s something going on that both the central government and the Central Bank are powerless to stop.  Citibank collapsing won&#8217;t do it.  An attempt to save Citibank that fails will.</p>
<p>Note to Ben Bernanke and Henry Paulson:  having the public pay for Jim Cayne&#8217;s country club membership and other retirement bennies just isn&#8217;t worth the risk.  Please stop.  Please.</p>

<blockquote><p>It is 3 a.m., and the stillness of the White House night is shattered by the ringing of the red phone. President John McCain, rousing himself from a deep sleep, turns on the light and picks up the receiver. A U.S. embassy in a Middle Eastern country, he is told, has been blown up, and al-Qaeda is taking credit.  McCain takes a deep breath. &#8220;Character counts, my friend,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Bomb Iran. Bomb, bomb Iran.&#8221;  There is a rustling of blankets, and, brushing aside Cindy McCain, a concerned Joe Lieberman rises from the bed. &#8220;Not Iran, Mr. President,&#8221; he says. &#8220;They hate al-Qaeda.&#8221;  &#8220;That&#8217;s right,&#8221; the president says. &#8220;I remember now.&#8221; He sighs with relief. &#8220;Good thing you&#8217;re here every night, Joe.&#8221;  But suppose, dear reader, that John McCain becomes president and Joe Lieberman doesn&#8217;t bunk with the McCains on a nightly basis. How easily should the rest of us sleep? It&#8217;s anything but an academic question after McCain&#8217;s bizarre performance in Jordan last week.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the rest of Harold’s case as it is spot on.  Harold concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Hard to say what&#8217;s more dangerous &#8211; McCain&#8217;s approach to the economy or McCain&#8217;s approach to the world. The thought of him answering the red phone at 3 a.m. fills me with foreboding. Hell, I don&#8217;t want him answering the red phone at 3 p.m.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh that’s right. Harold goes after McCain’s economics too.</p>

                                <p>Peter Morici writes a superb article &#8211;&#8220;It&#8217;s time to Cut the Trade Deficit&#8221;&#8211;in, of all places <a href="http://www.forbes.com/opinions/2008/03/25/globalization-recession-bernanke-banks-oped-cx_pm_0326morici.html">Forbes</a>, fighting the enemy on its own turf. Among my partially written pieces is one entitled &#8220;Credit or Trade,&#8221; in which I argue that the root of most of our problems is that we have substituted credit for trade. But Morici makes the case superbly:</p>
<p>The entire article follows:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Americans need to knock down some false gods. </p>
<p>Globalization is not an unalloyed good. We don&#8217;t need 300-horsepower cars. And Wall Street is not a citadel of integrity.</p>
<p>The 1990s were the golden age of free trade. The U.S. sealed the North American Free Trade Agreement, launched the World Trade Organization and escorted China into that temple of global commerce.</p>
<p>The idea was simple: Americans would import more T-shirts and furniture and sell more industrial machinery and software to a world hungry for technology. Americans would move into higher-productivity export industries and earn higher incomes in the trade-off. </p>
<p>In the 2000s, America&#8217;s CEOs, bankers and management consultants learned how to outsource just about everyone&#8217;s job but their own. Radiologists who read MRIs, journalists who wrote copy for local papers and computer engineers joined the ranks of workers displaced by imports.</p>
<p>The average American worker&#8217;s income stagnated, and, for many, inflation-adjusted wages fell. U.S. productivity gains were hogged by executives at Wall Street banks, technology companies and multinationals through big bonuses and peculiar, can&#8217;t-lose stock options. </p>
<p>The rest of us sunk into debt to fill our gas tanks, feed our children and, admittedly, buy too many cheap imports at Wal-Mart.</p>
<p>Imports soared much more rapidly than exports, the annual trade deficit jumped to more than $700 billion and Americans borrowed more than $6 trillion from foreigners to pay for two decades of trade deficits. This math permitted Americans to consume much more than we produced and spend more than we earned.</p>
<p>China is perhaps the biggest renegade in the mugging of the American middle class. The U.S. has slashed tariffs on Chinese products from auto parts to TVs, while China maintains much higher tariffs and notorious regulatory restrictions for U.S. exports in its market. </p>
<p>Topping it all, China subsidizes foreign purchases of its currency, the yuan, to the tune of $460 billion a year, making its products cheap on U.S. store shelves. The U.S. annual trade deficit with China is about $250 billion. </p>
<p>Chinese growth has pushed up global petroleum prices nearly five fold in six years, and the U.S. oil deficit is now $350 billion and rising.</p>
<p>The banks came up with more creative and risky mortgage products that permitted Americans to live beyond their means. We went from 10% down to 5% down to nothing down, with banks lending home buyers closing costs through second trusts. </p>
<p>Some loans that required no payback for five years even let folks dig deeper in their pockets on the premise that home prices would always go up. The banks sold these risky loans, bundled as bonds, to foreign investors like the Chinese government and foreign pension funds, as well as to U.S. insurance companies and corporations with cash to park. The bank executives paid themselves like royalty for the privilege of bilking trusting clients.</p>
<p>When the worst of the bonds&#8211;those backed by risking adjustable rate mortgages&#8211; collapsed, the banks got stuck with billions of unsold bonds. </p>
<p>Most recently, Bear Stearns collapsed, and the U.S. Federal Reserve is lending the banks $600 billion against shaky bonds on a 90-day revolving basis. That essentially socializes the banks&#8217; losses on bad bonds.</p>
<p>You have to love Ben Bernanke&#8217;s free trade capitalism. If you are an autoworker put out of work by Korean imports, he, as a good economist, tells you to go to school and find other work. If you are a New York banker caught paying yourself too much and run short of foreign investors to fleece, Ben will make you a loan and keep rolling until the bank finds a new game. </p>
<p>Now foreign investors are getting nervous about all the money they have loaned Americans and the integrity of U.S. banks. They are fleeing dollar investments for euro-denominated securities, gold, oil and just about anything more tangible than the shaky greenback.</p>
<p>Americans are forced to cut back, not just on purchases of cheap Chinese coffee makers, but also on automobiles and other products made in the U.S. Falling demand is casting the U.S. economy into recession, and we won&#8217;t be able to borrow enough to pull ourselves out.</p>
<p>Getting out of this mess is going to require Americans to live within their means&#8211;a.k.a. cut the trade deficit&#8211;and throw out the rascals on Wall Street. </p>
<p>Cutting the trade deficit requires burning less gasoline and balancing commerce with China. </p>
<p>Americans must either let the price of gas double to force conservation or accept cars with tougher mileage standards. Fifty miles per gallon by 2020, instead of the 35 required by current law, is achievable, but that means more hybrids and lighter vehicles.</p>
<p>The U.S. government should tax dollar-yuan conversions at a rate equal to China&#8217;s subsidies on yuan purchases until China stops manipulating currency markets. That would reduce imports from China, move a lot of production back home, raise U.S. productivity and workers incomes, and reduce the federal budget deficit.</p>
<p>Ben Bernanke has given the banks a lot and received little in return&#8211;except a lot of bad loans on the Fed&#8217;s books. It is high time he condition the Fed&#8217;s largesse on reforms at the big banks, even if that means lower salaries for the Brahmins on Wall Street. </p>
<p>After all, what makes them so special?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>According to the <a href="http://www.sunherald.com/447/story/452155-p2.html">Sun Herald</a>, foreign company delistings from the New York Stock Exchange rose from 6.6% in 2006 to 15.1% in 2007. The average rate between 1997 and 2006 was 7.3%. New SEC rules &#8220;permitting deregistration by foreign companies with low U.S. trading volumes became effective June 4, 2007&#8230;.this pent up demand is a reflection of the unattractiveness of the U.S. public equity market.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ironically, delistings are <i>not</i> from developing nations, but rather from Western Europe:<br />
<blockquote>Of the 53 companies that delisted not due to an acquisition, 43 were from Western Europe (8 each from the UK and France and 7 from Germany) and 4 were from Australia. Only 5 of the 53 delisting companies were from emerging market countries &#8212; Chile (1), Brazil (1), Hong Kong/China (2) and Israel (1). </p></blockquote>
<p>The rise in delistings has prompted much discussion regarding the efficacy of Sarbanes-Oxley.<br />Is it an onerous regulation as the above article suggests&#8230;or is it separating the chaff from the wheat?</p>
<p>The purpose of Sarbanes-Oxley Act (2002) is to improve financial accounting and to insist on responsible corporate governance.</p>
<p>The authors of a 2006 <a href="http://www.baf.cuhk.edu.hk/research/cig/pdf_download/SOX.pdf">study</a>, &#8220;Is the Sarbanes-Oxley Act Scaring Away Lemons or Oranges?&#8221; conclude that lemons are the case.</p>
<blockquote><p>we find that voluntary delisting firms tend to have weaker corporate governance systems as measured by several traditional corporate governance proxies (proportion of outside directors, ownership concentration, and financial reporting quality). We find additional support for this result when we introduce investors’ price response to SOX-related events as a broad proxy for investors’ assessment of their firm’s corporate governance quality.</p></blockquote>
<p>A number of accounting and governance scandals&#8211;Enron, Tycho, Adelphi, et al&#8211;prompted the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, expect the argument over Sarbanes-Oxley now to be joined once again.</p>

                                <p>This mornings Wall Street Journal article on the stock markets lost decade gives me an excuse to publish one of my favorite charts&#8211; the really long term history of the stock market PE back to 1871.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R-qgnymoYZI/AAAAAAAAAKk/wk8wPgAYYUw/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R-qgnymoYZI/AAAAAAAAAKk/wk8wPgAYYUw/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>If you listen to Wall Street strategist they frequently talk about the long term average of the stock market PE being 14.5 as if their were some long term tendency for the market to trade near its long term average.  But this chart shows that there is no central tendency for the market to trade around its average.  The only tendency is for the market to swing from a PE of under 10 to a PE of over 20.  If you do a frequency diagram you find that it is fairly flat at most values between 10 and 20.  Until the late 1990s bubble the decision rule to sell when the market PE rose over 20 had a perfect history.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s WSJ article gave the impression that the lost decade should be setting the stage for a period of superior returns as the market returns to the mean.  But this chart implies that the market still has a lot of downside as the market PE has only fallen to about its long term average<br />and still has a tendency to fall to below 10.</p>
<p>But that is what makes a market, you pays your money and takes your pick.</p>
<p>P.S. I have added a chart comparing the market and cash since the PE went over 20 in mid-1997.</p>
