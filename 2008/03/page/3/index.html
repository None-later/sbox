                                <p><a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080325-ip-hypocrisy-us-likes-wto-rulings-only-when-it-wins.html">Arstechnica</a> had thoughts on WTO mediation and US indignation about IP rights.</p>
<blockquote><p>The second case concerns Antigua and Barbuda, a small Caribbean country home to all sorts of online vices, including gambling and DRM circumvention. Antigua took the US to the WTO years ago over charges that the US was unfairly criminalizing access to Antiguan gambling websites while still allowing US-based horse racing sites to function. The WTO ruled against the US on several occasions, including a 2007 ruling that found the US had not yet bothered to comply with previous rulings.</p>
<p>In retaliation, Antigua has announced a radical plan in an attempt to force its larger neighbor to play ball. The Antiguan government has recently stated that it will allow piracy of US intellectual property such as movies and movies unless the US changes its gambling policy (though this move has yet to be authorized by the WTO).</p>
<p>Apparently, it&#8217;s easy to get hot and bothered when it&#8217;s industries from your country that claim to be badly affected by rules elsewhere. When it comes to the claims of other countries, though, even claims that have been validated by the WTO, it&#8217;s much easier to see the complexity of the situation, to spend years arguing those complexities before judges, and to do nothing even when compelled by rulings.</p>
<p>This sort of behavior makes it that much harder to assert some kind of moral high ground when China, Russia, and others pick and choose which of their WTO obligations they are going to comply with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly a David and Goliath situation, but moral symbols have a way of boomeranging when trying to make your case in another arena. Just in case you were wondering.</p>

                                <p>This one is by reader Kaleberg.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Diana Henriques at the New York TImes has a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/28/business/28commodities.html">fascinating article on Odd Crop Prices</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Economists note there should not be two prices for one thing at the same place and time. Could a drugstore sell two identical tubes of toothpaste, and charge 50 cents more for one of them? Of course not.</p>
<p>But, in effect, exactly that has been happening, repeatedly and mysteriously, in trading that sets prices for corn, soybeans and wheat — three of America’s biggest crops and, lately, popular targets for investors pouring into the volatile commodities market. Economists who have been studying this phenomenon say they are at a loss to explain it.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, the price for a bushel of grain set in the derivatives markets has been substantially higher than the simultaneous price in the cash market.</p>
<p>When that happens, no one can be exactly sure which is the accurate price in these crucial commodity markets, an uncertainty that can influence food prices and production decisions around the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>A futures contract is an agreement to deliver a specific amount of a commodity — 5,000 bushels of wheat, say — on a certain date in the future. Such contracts are important hedging tools for farmers, grain elevators, commodity processors and anyone with a stake in future grain prices. A futures contract that calls for delivery of wheat in July may trade for more or less for each bushel than today’s cash market price. But as each day goes by, its price should move a bit closer to that day’s cash price. And on expiration day, when the bushels of wheat covered by that futures contract are due for delivery, their price should very nearly match the price in the cash market, allowing for a little market friction or major delivery disruptions like Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>But on dozens of occasions since early 2006, the futures contracts for corn, wheat and soybeans have expired at a price that was much higher than that day’s cash price for those grains.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>What is not happening in these markets is equally mysterious. Normally, price disparities like these are quickly exploited by arbitrage traders who buy goods in the cheap market and sell them in the expensive one. Their buying and selling quickly brings the prices back into balance — but that is not happening here.</p>
<p>“These are highly competitive markets with very experienced traders,” he said. “Yet they are leaving these profits alone? It just doesn’t make sense.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Someone is leaving money on the table. Farm product futures prices are much higher than farm product prices even as time goes to zero. We  have farmers up the gazoo around here, so I could actually buy and  deliver a freight car full of broccoli seeds and make some money off a broccoli seed speculator.</p>
<p>My informed friend tells me that this is another sign of too much  money, too few investment opportunities. The money has now sloshed into the commodities market and is distorting prices there. I am more  inclined to believe that this has something to do with investment  grade sardines and a decoupling of commodities and boxcars.</p>
<p>Does anyone else have any ideas?</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Here is a link to  some <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08572t.pdf"> testimony from the GAO</a> (hat-tip to rdan):</p>
<blockquote><p>GAO has raised concerns about increasing [DoD] reliance on contractors to perform agency missions.</p></blockquote>
<p>GAO states that agencies have been challenged, meaning they fail, at determining what work should be retained and which should be contracted. The GAO also noted issues with oversight &#8220;including addressing risks, ethics concerns, and surveillance needs&#8221;. </p>
<p>I have seen the risks listed by GAO, both as a government employee and as one of the contractors. Here are some risks: level of effort and best effort services contracts where the government &#8220;ordered&#8221; labor categories and full time equivalents instead of services and then never measured the deliveries. Substantiated receiving reports with weekly records of meetings attended, conflate attending meetings with productivity as Scott Admas has noted. Government pays a very high salaried labor rate for &#8220;work&#8221;, not performance, done at much less difficulty [pay a rocket scientist&#8217;s rate to do power point charts] and at full time hours when there is no service provided worth the time or rate. Ethics issues abound: hire friends, recently retired, for made up work, at excellent rates to do best effort. Be good to the contractors so when you retire you get in on the gravy train.</p>
<p>The sole determinant of the value of services delivered was the front line employee benefitting with no regard for what the mission got from the &#8220;support&#8221;.</p>
<p>Surveillance is not done, the contracting officer does not understand requirements and there is no checking to see what labor hours went to what billing and what results could be seen for the billed effort or hours or labor rate.</p>
<p>Then do the service make any sense? Like making sure that contractors supposedly doing non personal services but interchangeable with employees, avoid compromising privacy act information on presidential candidates.</p>
<p>GAO met with commanders deploying in 2006 who said their &#8220;pre-deployment training did not provide them with sufficient information on the extent of contractor support that they would be relying on.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words the soldiers have to provide &#8220;force protection&#8221; for contractors, if the contractors were soldiers they would carry rifles and not burden the soldiers they are supposed to support. A steep price for not having soldiers doing support.</p>
<p>Shifting gears the report talks about depot maintenance. They comment on how much work &#8220;needs&#8221; to be done in-house [congressional depot caucus passed laws which require certain repair work, called &#8220;core&#8221; be done in government arsenals] and how much is contracted out. They conclude that &#8220;core maintenance capability has not always been developed&#8221;. This means the acquiring activity, like the program manager buying the Airbus refueler uses the money that should have been invested in setting up core maintenance for overruns somewhere else.</p>
<p>Finally, they state that the reasons such as savings and effective repairs with quick repair &#8220;turns&#8221; for using contracted maintenance are not realized and &#8220;it is uncertain to what extent cost savings have occurred or will occur.&#8221; GAO does not correlate this finding with past audits where they concluded that DoD use of logistics contracts never yielded required performance at the cost contracted.</p>
<p>This report understates the problems and inefficiencies of contracting to perform services for the federal government. It would be politically difficult to cut back on the service contractors, with PACs supported by the financial power of the contractors which have more than doubled in cost since 9/11.</p>
<p>Contractors have infiltrated to the point they make work for each other, find new opportunities for their level of effort services and cannot be distinguished from government folks.</p>
<p>Level of effort is synonym with make work.</p>
<p>And I do not think GAO has scratched the surface on advisory and assistance services contractors, who do services which are not &#8220;commercial services&#8221;. Where they often double up to make life easy and comfortable for the government workers, painting rocks and starching fatigues.</p>
<p>In the not too distant past, I got in &#8220;trouble&#8221; as a government employee for not going to unnecessary, make work training developed conducted by a contractor.  Contractors more and more get involved in painting the rocks and helping with &#8220;breaking starch&#8221;.</p>
<p>National security has been a growth industry the past 7 years.</p>

<p>Its seeing an agency that represents the people of the United States take an ill-advised action at the request of corrupt nepotists who claim to be on our side but really aren&#8217;t by spending reams of money and failing to pull it off.  Its one thing to show extremely poor judgement .  Its another thing to show weakness.</p>

                                <p>What was that about the surge working again?  <a href="http://www.juancole.com/2008/03/police-mutiny-refuse-to-attack-sadrists.html">Juan Cole</a> reports on the fighting between Maliki’s v. Sadr’s forces:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Times of Baghdad reports in Arabic that clashes continued on Friday between Iraqi government forces and the Mahdi Army in Baghdad and the provinces of the middle Euphrates and the south, causing hundreds of casualties, including among women, children and the elderly. The fighting also did damage to Iraq&#8217;s infrastructure, as well as to oil facilities and pipelines, damage that might run into the billions of dollars. The US got drawn into the fighting on Friday. US planes bombed alleged Mahdi Army positions both in Basra and in Sadr City in Baghdad (as well as in Kadhimiya). Kadhimiya is a major Shiite shrine neighborhood in northwest Baghdad, and the spectacle of the US bombing it is very unlikely to win Washington any friends among Iraqi Shiites. Despite the US intervention, government troops were unable to pierce Mahdi Army defenses or over-run their positions. Al-Zaman says that the police force in Basra suffered numerous mutinies and instances of insubordination, with policemen refusing to fire on the Mahdi Army. The government response was to undertake a widespread purge of disloyal elements &#8230; In the meantime, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki called for a decisive military victory and rejected calls by southern tribal sheikhs and a large number of Shiite ayatollahs for him to engage in dialogue and negotiation in order to reach a ceasefire and to save civilians who are threatened with a humanitarian catastrophe from shortages of water and food, as well as lack of medical care. At the same time, Al-Zaman maintains, the Sadrists stipulated that al-Maliki and his brother-in-law, who heads the emergency forces that have been sent down to Basra from Baghdad and Basra, must withdraw.  The Iraqi minister of defense, Abdul Qadir Jasim, admitted in a news conference in Basra that the militiamen had taken the Iraqi security forces off guard. He added that the Iraqi government had expected this operation to be routine, but was surprised at the level of resistance, and was forced to change its plans and tactics.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Maliki might have hoped to crush Sadr, things aren’t going so well.  Especially given the fact that some of his forces refuse to fire on their countrymen.  Well – at least Maliki can count on US soldiers to carry out his political goals.  But remind me again – why the hell do we remain in this middle of this quagmire?</p>

Anyone  know where I can find historical data (going back to 1964 or 1952, if possible) on the typical expenditures (housing, food, transportation, etc.) by the average person.  I&#8217;ve found some of that going back to 1980 in the NIPA tables, and some food prices going back about the same time at the BLS, but nothing on total average expenditures.</p>

<blockquote><p>You know, I have no apology to make for our generation.  Mistakes we’ve made to be sure.  We haven’t achieved all that would like to have achieved.  But still we are a generation that has lived through three world wars and a cataclysmic depression that shook the very foundation of our nation.  I believe basically our generation has remained true to our belief in simple justice.  We have remained compassionate to those less fortunate.  We have stood firm in our duties to those who would come after us.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, this was in 1967.  What were the three world wars?  Obviously, there was WW1 and WW2.  What&#8217;s the third?  Korea?</p>

                                <p>It is time to call the National Review’s <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=YTRiODFmYWU3NWY3Nzc5MWJlMTM1ZWNlOGU2ZTkxYmY=">Phil Kerpen</a> for what he is – a very dishonest person.  But before I do so, let me remind folks of something <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116131055641498552.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">Greg Mankiw</a> wrote on the issue of raising the gasoline tax.</p>
<blockquote><p>Public finance experts have long preached that consumption taxes are better than income taxes for long-run economic growth, because income taxes discourage saving and investment. Gas is a component of consumption. An increased reliance on gas taxes over income taxes would make the tax code more favorable to growth. It would also encourage firms to devote more R&#038;D spending to the search for gasoline substitutes.</p></blockquote>
<p>I suspect Kerpen is not going to join Greg’s Pigou Club:</p>
<blockquote><p>The numerous energy taxes and regulatory schemes being proposed internationally, federally, and locally in the name of fighting global warming are a dire threat to freedom and prosperity. The costs associated with some of these proposals — both in dollars and lost liberty — are staggering.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really?!  Kerpen begins his scientific demonstration of how high these costs are by talking about opinion polls and politics.  Sorry – but that’s nothing about a farce.  But then he makes this claim:</p>
<blockquote><p>An analysis commissioned by the American Council on Capital Formation and the National Association of Manufacturers projects the economic impact of the bill by 2030: 3 to 4 million fewer jobs, $4,022 to $6,752 in lower annual disposable income per household, an annual hit to GDP of between $631 billion and $669 billion, and much higher energy prices — 60 percent to 144 percent higher for gasoline and 77 percent to 129 percent higher for electricity. These figures are all adjusted for inflation. The study also found that lower-income families — people who are least able to absorb higher energy costs — will be the hardest hit.</p></blockquote>
<p>As soon as I read that <a href="http://www.accf.org/nam.html">ACCF</a> and NAM commissioned this “analysis”, I grew a little suspicious:</p>
<blockquote><p>Conducted by Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), the independent study unveiled today examines the implications of the legislation with respect to Gross Domestic Product and Gross State Product, future energy costs, economic growth, employment, production, household income, the impact on low income earners and other measurements. The study includes a comprehensive national economic assessment, as well as separate and specific overviews of the impacts the legislation could have on all 50 U.S. states.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, what are the economic credentials of this <a href="http://www.saic.com/">SAIC</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p>Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC), a leading systems, solutions and technical services company, offers a broad range of expertise in defense modernization efforts, intelligence, homeland security, logistics and product support, health and life sciences, space and earth sciences and global commercial services.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh?  SAIC is not a group of leading economists after all?  Phil Kerpen should be ashamed of himself for this fraud.  Then again – he writes for the National Review who routinely lie to their readers.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: CoRev has us go <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0327/p17s01-sten.html">here</a> as he claims that an EPA study is consistent with this unsigned (by any named economist) SAIC “analysis”, but let’s have a read:</p>
<blockquote><p>Even when experts look at the same data, they can come to vastly different conclusions.  One of the biggest questions about climate change is: What will it cost to fix? Figuring that out is a huge challenge &#8230; The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently issued its economic analysis of the bill. Not surprisingly, supporters and opponents each found things in it to bolster their arguments. Congressional Quarterly quotes Sen. Barbara Boxer (D) of California, who chairs the Environment and Public Works Committee, as saying: &#8220;When you look at all the scenarios the EPA analyzed, the one that most closely reflects the Lieberman-Warner bill&#8217;s technology driving policies shows that this bill is a winner for the environment, a winner for our economy, and a winner for the planet.&#8221; But the piece also quotes Sen. James In¬¬hofe (R) of Oklahoma, one of the Senate&#8217;s most vocal critics of global warming, who sees the legislation quite differently: &#8220;Americans will pay significantly more at the pump, in their homes, and in many cases, with their jobs.&#8221; Under the Lieberman-Warner bill, US gross domestic product grows 80 percent from 2010 to 2030 – just one percentage point less than projected without the bill. And average annual per-household consumption grows 81 percent over the same period – just two percentage points less than without the bill. At the same time, the price of electricity would increase 18 percent between 2010 and 2050 under the bill, according to the EPA analysis document. Environmentalists tended to see the bright side. The director of economic policy and analysis at the Environmental Defense Fund, Nathaniel Keohane, said: &#8220;EPA&#8217;s results for the scenario that most resembles the bill confirm what we have seen in every reputable analysis. We can grow our economy and tackle global warming at the same time&#8230;. The up-front costs EPA identifies are a sound investment for a strong economy down the road. For clean air, less imported oil, and avoiding the damage of climate change, they are a bargain.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But CoRev got confused and cut and pasted the SAIC silliness as if it were what the EPA said.  No!  The EPA estimates showed a much, much lower cost to GDP.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>So now that the Civil War in Iraq has flared up again, it seems (again) we&#8217;re siding with the more pro-Iran faction (Maliki) against the less pro-Iran faction (Sadr).  Not only are we arguably backing the less palatable of the two sides, but as this <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article3635838.ece">Times of London</a> story (which I&#8217;ve seen linked to in several places already) indicates, even that is being done poorly&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Abu Iman barely flinched when the Iraqi Government ordered his unit of special police to move against al-Mahdi Army fighters in Basra.</p>
<p>His response, while swift, was not what British and US military trainers who have spent the past five years schooling the Iraqi security forces would have hoped for. He and 15 of his comrades took off their uniforms, kept their government-issued rifles and went over to the other side without a second thought.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess this goes a long way toward answering the question of why, after five years of training, the Iraqi military still can&#8217;t deal with the insurgents.</p>
<p>But it raises the question&#8230; if the administration truly has chosen the least palatable side, how should Americans feel about it?  Assuming Iran really is a big problem, do we root for Maliki&#8217;s side&#8230; knowing he&#8217;s going to be far more buddy-buddy with Iran than he is with us (and than Sadr would be)?  Or, do we root for Sadr, who at this point has to be pretty damn anti-American, but at least he might dislike (according to various reports) the Iranian regime even more than he does us?  Does &#8220;my country right or wrong&#8221; work when my country is shooting itself in the foot?  American soldiers are fighting and dying, but what if they&#8217;re fighting and dying for a cause that, if it wins, will cause even more American soldiers to fight and die?</p>
