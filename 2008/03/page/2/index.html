                                <p>Angrybear has had a tradition of allowing a free flow of comments.  Other blogs have not and I find the following quite interesting.  From <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2008/03/27/boing-boings-moderat.html">Boing Boing&#8217;s Moderation Policy</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Q. What&#8217;s likely to land me in your bad graces?<br />A. Since you&#8217;ve asked, here&#8217;s a nowhere-near-exhaustive list:<br />1. Spamming. Linkwhoring. Re-posting text you&#8217;ve already posted on a dozen other sites.<br />2. Making supercilious and unpleasant remarks in a civil liberties thread about how the victim had it coming. This is not to say that victims never have it coming; but there&#8217;s a species of internet demi-troll that appears to specialize in posting such comments. Try not to look like you&#8217;re one of them.<br />3. Making snide comments and insinuations about the editors. That&#8217;s right out. You don&#8217;t like one of the editors? Take it up with them in e-mail. If you&#8217;re going to comment on an entry, talk about the entry.<br />4. Being nasty to no purpose. (This is the catch-all.)<br />5. Using unnecessarily exciting language. Making an argument is fine. Making your argument in language guaranteed to make your hearers see red? Bad idea. It practically guarantees that you&#8217;re going to have a dumb (and therefore boring) argument. And if the argument&#8217;s not going to be interesting, we don&#8217;t see the point.<br />6. Jeering, sneering, condescending, or one-upping when there&#8217;s been no provocation. Telling people they&#8217;re naive idiots for caring about whatever-it-is. Like the &#8220;I&#8217;m bored&#8221; pose, it&#8217;s empty attitudinizing, and it&#8217;s remarkably unpleasant.<br />7. Failing to notice that there are other people in the conversation. Posting a remark that&#8217;s already been made five times and answered six. Coming back and re-posting essentially the same material after a twenty-message thread has discussed your previous comment. Trying to forcibly wrench the conversation onto one of your own pet topics. Posting a stale, canned rant you&#8217;ve posted a dozen times before at other sites. Not coming back to see how others have responded to you.<br />Why post comments at all, unless you expect to be read? And if you expect to be read, you must know you&#8217;re part of a conversation. Therefore, you should act like it. Engage with what the other commenters are saying. Read the thread before you add to it.<br />8. Posting a snotty but otherwise worthless anonymous comment. It&#8217;s a lot easier to get away with snotty comments if you&#8217;re a registered user.<br />9. Dragging in one of those topics that&#8217;s guaranteed to generate a huge thrash that goes nowhere, like gun control, abortion, or Mac vs. PC vs. Linux. You&#8217;re only allowed to discuss those if (a.) they&#8217;re relevant to the entry; and (b.) everyone in the discussion is doing their level best to say something new.<br />10. This list will undoubtedly get longer.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Comments by Trolls and Asshats:</p>
<p>This may be a free country, but The Big Picture is my personal fiefdom. I rule over all as benevolent dictator/philospher king/utility infielder. Fear my wrath, mortals! <br />I will ban anyone whom I choose from posting comments &#8212; usually, for a damned good reason, but on rare occasions, for the exact same reason God created the platypus: because I feel like it. <br />I encourage a broad range of perspectives, philosophies, sexual orientations. Dissent is good. I want to see a debate of views, a battle in the market place of ideas. (Thomas Jefferson wasn&#8217;t so dumb after all). You can post on nearly anything, so long as it is at least tangentially related to the topic at hand. <br />On occasion, I will &#8220;unpublish&#8221; a comment if I feel it is too impolite, harsh, ad hominem, inappropriate, or off-topic. Off-topic posts have been rising, and I have taken to unpublishing them en masse. Publish too many comments on a given post (3 or 4 relevant comments out of 30 are fine, 10 out of 30 is excessive). It takes me ~10 seconds to un-publish 10 comments.<br />If you find yourself publishing way too many comments, consider this: This humble blog is my forum for expressing my ideas. Get your own damned blog.   <br />A few things that will get you permanently banned from commenting at The Big Picture. The fastest way to lose posting privileges is to misrepresent your host&#8217;s complex and nuanced views in some inane bumper sticker comment. Those who do this, be advised: I&#8217;ve read your prose and considered your thought process: Suffice it to say that Robert Frost&#8217;s legacy is safe. Your comments will not be missed. <br />Other fast tracks to getting banned: <br />&#8211; Knowingly posting false or malicious material;<br />&#8211; multiple postings under different names;<br />&#8211; generally engaging in troll-like behavior;<br />&#8211; misquoting your host/overlord;<br />&#8211; being impolite in the extreme;<br />&#8211; ad hominem attacks;<br />&#8211; being an asshole.<br />Right now, someone is reading this and saying to themselves &#8220;What does he mean, being an asshole?&#8221; If you wondered that to yourself, well the odds strongly favor that you yourself have sphincter-like qualities. Thus, you should consider it likely that you will be banned as a rectoid from posting comments sometime in the near future.</p></blockquote>

<p>Which experts?</p>
<p>If an agency is not looking, or actively praising instead of evaluating, I suppose they also would fail to recognize problems.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.alternet.org/environment/80508/">Alternet</a>, a leftist blog, carries this interview with Dr. Jansen, head of Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA&#8217;s premiere climate research center. So might that make it slightly left of center?</p>
<blockquote><p>DR. JAMES HANSEN: Well, my concern is general with both Republican and Democratic administrations. They both feel that they can control what scientists say to the public. So their offices of public affairs in the science agencies are headed, in general, by political appointees, and they review the press releases before they go out. So, it doesn&#8217;t really make sense in a democracy. The public should be honestly informed. And then, of course, the publications are allowed to make the decisions, and they don&#8217;t have to follow exactly what the science says. There are other considerations that they have. But they shouldn&#8217;t influence what is presented, the scientific evidence. And I object to that, regardless of which administration is in power.</p></blockquote>
<p>I posit that the Bush administration has been much better at bending the bureacracy to its political needs because of breadth of coverage, and the instituting positions of political screening in every department, albeit in a variety of guises (I have written on this several times).</p>
<p>I for one will be closely watching to see if any of the apparautus is dismantled with a new president. I am not optimistic, and am sure it will not be thorough.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I know it is not fashionable to praise former members of the Carter Administration but I have always admired how Zbigniew Brzezinski expresses his views.  While I don’t always agree with him – his latest on the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/27/AR2008032702405.html">Iraq mess</a> is exactly right on several issues.  First &#8211; why did we invade Iraq?</p>
<blockquote><p>The case for U.S. disengagement from combat is compelling in its own right. But it must be matched by a comprehensive political and diplomatic effort to mitigate the destabilizing regional consequences of a war that the outgoing Bush administration started deliberately, justified demagogically and waged badly.</p></blockquote>
<p>President Bush did start this disastrous war for demagogic reasons, but Brzezinski has already moved onto whether we stay or go:</p>
<blockquote><p>Both Democratic presidential candidates agree that the United States should end its combat mission in Iraq within 12 to 16 months of their possible inauguration. The Republican candidate has spoken of continuing the war, even for a hundred years, until &#8220;victory.&#8221; The core issue of this campaign is thus a basic disagreement over the merits of the war and the benefits and costs of continuing it … The contrast between the Democratic argument for ending the war and the Republican argument for continuing is sharp and dramatic. The case for terminating the war is based on its prohibitive and tangible costs, while the case for &#8220;staying the course&#8221; draws heavily on shadowy fears of the unknown and relies on worst-case scenarios. President Bush&#8217;s and Sen. John McCain&#8217;s forecasts of regional catastrophe are quite reminiscent of the predictions of &#8220;falling dominoes&#8221; that were used to justify continued U.S. involvement in Vietnam. Neither has provided any real evidence that ending the war would mean disaster, but their fear-mongering makes prolonging it easier.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm – it seems John McCain has picked on the Bush-Cheney demagogy.  But wasn’t getting rid of Saddam worth it?</p>
<blockquote><p>Nor do the costs of this fiasco end there. The war has inflamed anti-American passions in the Middle East and South Asia while fragmenting Iraqi society and increasing the influence of Iran. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#8217;s recent visit to Baghdad offers ample testimony that even the U.S.-installed government in Iraq is becoming susceptible to Iranian blandishments. In brief, the war has become a national tragedy, an economic catastrophe, a regional disaster and a global boomerang for the United States. Ending it is thus in the highest national interest.</p></blockquote>
<p>But wouldn’t leaving now lead to an Al Qaeda victory?</p>
<blockquote><p>Contrary to Republican claims that our departure will mean calamity, a sensibly conducted disengagement will actually make Iraq more stable over the long term. The impasse in Shiite-Sunni relations is in large part the sour byproduct of the destructive U.S. occupation, which breeds Iraqi dependency even as it shatters Iraqi society. In this context, so highly reminiscent of the British colonial era, the longer we stay in Iraq, the less incentive various contending groups will have to compromise and the more reason simply to sit back. A serious dialogue with the Iraqi leaders about the forthcoming U.S. disengagement would shake them out of their stupor. Ending the U.S. war effort entails some risks, of course, but they are inescapable at this late date. Parts of Iraq are already self-governing, including Kurdistan, part of the Shiite south and some tribal areas in the Sunni center. U.S. military disengagement will accelerate Iraqi competition to more effectively control their territory, which may produce a phase of intensified inter-Iraqi conflicts. But that hazard is the unavoidable consequence of the prolonged U.S. occupation. The longer it lasts, the more difficult it will be for a viable Iraqi state ever to reemerge. It is also important to recognize that most of the anti-U.S. insurgency in Iraq has not been inspired by al-Qaeda. Locally based jihadist groups have gained strength only insofar as they have been able to identify themselves with the fight against a hated foreign occupier. As the occupation winds down and Iraqis take responsibility for internal security, al-Qaeda in Iraq will be left more isolated and less able to sustain itself. The end of the occupation will thus be a boon for the war on al-Qaeda, bringing to an end a misguided adventure that not only precipitated the appearance of al-Qaeda in Iraq but also diverted the United States from Afghanistan, where the original al-Qaeda threat grew and still persists. Bringing the U.S. military effort to a close would also smooth the way for a broad U.S. initiative addressed to all of Iraq&#8217;s neighbors. Some will remain reluctant to engage in any discussion as long as Washington appears determined to maintain its occupation of Iraq indefinitely. Therefore, at some stage next year, after the decision to disengage has been announced, a regional conference should be convened to promote regional stability, border control and other security arrangements, as well as regional economic development &#8212; all of which would help mitigate the unavoidable risks connected with U.S. disengagement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Brzezinski does not pretend the leaving Iraq will be easy and he offers diplomatic steps that should be taken.  Alas, the current Administration refuses to listen to anything that makes sense.  Judging from the neocon nonsense from John McCain – he is not listening either.</p>
<p>Update: US forces are bombing Iraqis in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/world/middleeast/29iraq.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;oref=slogin">Basra</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The American military conducted airstrikes Thursday and Friday to back up stalled Iraqi forces in Basra and battle Shiite militias in Baghdad as continued violence and political infighting worsened the prospects for any timely reconciliation among Iraq’s warring factions. Although American officials have emphasized that the campaign in the southern port city of Basra is directed by Iraqi forces, the Iraqis have failed so far to wrest control of neighborhoods in Basra from Shiite militias and asked the Americans and British to step in. The Iraqi military does not have jet fighters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Al Qaeda must see this as a huge PR victory.  Meanwhile, <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/2008/03/iraqs_sadr_tells_followers_to.php">Reuters</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>Shi&#8217;ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr has told his followers not to lay down their arms, rejecting a demand by the Iraqi government which launched a crackdown against them this week, a top aide said on Saturday.</p></blockquote>
<p>Seriously – why do we leave our troops in the middle of this mess?</p>

<p>And don&#8217;t give me that crap about how they haven&#8217;t decided on one yet. Anyone who has been thinking and then running for President for the past several years and doesn&#8217;t have an idea of who they would to join them on the ticket doesn&#8217;t deserve the job.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I don&#8217;t think many people can argue GW has had a succesful presidency.  This isn&#8217;t a partisan statement &#8211; I remember the Reagan, GHW Bush, and Clinton administrations, and this one is simply qualitatively different from those.  </p>
<p>The administration&#8217;s early <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/usbudget/blueprint/bud01.html">promises to pay down the federal debt</a> have been long forgotten.  The proud speeches about the &#8220;ownership economy&#8221; haven&#8217;t been heard in years.  Despite massive, perhaps unprecedented help from the Fed, and a compliant Congress which gave him just about everything he wanted, the fastest year of growth in <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls">real GDP</a> under GW was 3.6%.  To give you an idea how inadequate that is, under half the Presidents following the 1929 crash, FDR, JFK, LBJ, Carter, Reagan, and Clinton, the median annual real growth was faster than that.  GW&#8217;s best year would have been sub-par for half the Presidents in the sample!  If there&#8217;s an economic success story that GW will leave behind, its hard to imagine what it could be.</p>
<p>But economics isn&#8217;t everything.  Osama hasn&#8217;t been captured, dead or alive, though we do catch a glimpse on the occasional video.  Afghanistan isn&#8217;t going as promised, and neither is Iraq.  And then there&#8217;s diplomacy, about which the less said, the better.</p>
<p>So, with a year to go, thinking in terms of GW and his administration, what do you think will be the biggest successes and failures of the coming year?</p>

                                <p>Why do I feel uneasy about statements like the following, appearing in Paulson&#8217;s latest <a href="http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/documents/executive_summary_032908.pdf?hpid=topnews">recommendations</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Treasury began this current study of regulatory structure after convening a conference on capital markets competitiveness in March 2007. Conference participants, including current and former policymakers and industry leaders, noted that while functioning well, the U.S. regulatory structure is not optimal for promoting a competitive financial services sector leading the world and supporting continued economic innovation at home and abroad. Following this conference, Treasury launched a major effort to collect views on how to improve the financial services regulatory structure. </p></blockquote>
<p>Foxes in the hen house? And where were the foxes before March 2008? Smiling?</p>
<p>Or try this one:<br />
<blockquote>Financial markets in the United States have developed into world class centers of capital and have led financial innovation. </p></blockquote>
<p>Paulson gives a nice pat on the back for our &#8220;centers of capital&#8221; that have &#8220;led financial innovation.&#8221; Wonder what members of the committee inserted that one? Yes, yes, the industry leaders we now have to rescue. But marvel, please, at all those financial innovations.</p>
<p>And I just cannot get my head around the next one:<br />
<blockquote>Now, however, maturing foreign financial markets and their ability to provide alternate sources of capital and financial innovation in a more efficient and modern regulatory system are pressuring the U.S. financial services industry and its regulatory structure. </p></blockquote>
<p>The Cause, the Prime Mover for our problems, are &#8220;maturing foreign financial markets.&#8221; May we have some examples of these &#8220;alternate&#8221; sources, please? Do we mean SWF&#8217;s? How have they contributed to our problems? In case you have not noticed, their wealth is a direct result of our poor trade policies.</p>
<p>And then, there is this one:<br />
<blockquote>Treasury believes it must ensure that the U.S. regulatory structure does not inhibit the continued growth and stability of the U.S. financial services industry and the economy as a whole.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I certainly cannot comment at this time on the specific proposals. They are wrapped in generalities and glossy overviews, difficult to penetrate. For us chickens, details are everything. Lots of deck chairs on the move. But I can make some observations:
<ol>
<li>We cannot rely on financial institutions to carry this economy, no matter how big the bonuses were, are&#8230;or will be.</li>
<li>Right now, the financial industry is in the hen house. They seem to be the ones &#8220;patching the leaks.&#8221;</li>
<li>Our manufacturing centers are vanishing; almost everything is being off-shored&#8230;from pharmaceuticals to computers, from dental bridges to accounting to electronic passports.</li>
<li>We are far too dependent on central banks to cover our rising debt.</li>
<li>Credit cannot substitute for trade.</li>
<li>Strong labor unions create vibrant middle classes. The Regan Revolution has been a rousing failure. Wages have been stagnant or declining.</li>
<li>Wealth is being concentrated into the hands of a few.</li>
<li>At the center of this mess lies the WTO and our trade deals. In not insisting that all of our trading partners respect labor, defending its rights to collectively bargain, we have encouraged companies to go elsewhere where labor has no rights and is dirt cheap. </li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, at the center of the mess is the WTO and our trade policies. For wealth to be more evenly distributed, labor must be protected, here and abroad. It really is time to look at how trade is being conducted. Credit and financial innovation alone create disaster.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/the-gramm-connection">Paul Krugman</a> picks up on the implications of McCain relying on Phil Gramm as an economic advisor.  I’d rather see Gramm – the fiscal hawk – advising McCain on spending and tax policy than the free lunch hack named Art Laffer even if Gramm would balance the budget with spending cuts than tax increases.  But it’s reform of the financial system that is at issue in Paul’s post.  As <a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0308/9246.html">Politico</a> notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The general co-chairman of John McCain’s presidential campaign, former Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas), led the charge in 1999 to repeal a Depression-era banking regulation law that Democrat Barack Obama claimed on Thursday contributed significantly to today’s economic turmoil. “A regulatory structure set up for banks in the 1930s needed to change because the nature of business had changed,” the Illinois senator running for president said in a New York economic speech. “But by the time [it] was repealed in 1999, the $300 million lobbying effort that drove deregulation was more about facilitating mergers than creating an efficient regulatory framework.” Gramm’s role in the swift and dramatic recent restructuring of the nation’s investment houses and practices didn’t stop there. A year after the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed the old regulations, Swiss Bank UBS gobbled up brokerage house Paine Weber. Two years later, Gramm settled in as a vice chairman of UBS’s new investment banking arm. <br />Later, he became a major player in its government affairs operation. According to federal lobbying disclosure records, Gramm lobbied Congress, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department about banking and mortgage issues in 2005 and 2006. During those years, the mortgage industry pressed Congress to roll back strong state rules that sought to stem the rise of predatory tactics used by lenders and brokers to place homeowners in high-cost mortgages.  For his work, Gramm and two other lobbyists collected $750,000 in fees from UBS’s American subsidiary. In the past year, UBS has written down more then $18 billion in exposure to subprime loans and other risky securities and is considering cutting as many as 8,000 jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you say crony capitalism?  As Paul notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Seriously, the Gramm connection tells you all you need to know about where a McCain administration would stand on financial issues: squarely against any significant reform.</p></blockquote>
<p>Then again – McCain seems to listen more to Art Laffer than Phil Gramm on fiscal policy.  Ahem!</p>

<p><strong>How bad things get</strong> at Harvard</p>
<blockquote><p>An e-mail from the assistant to an incredibly distinguished Harvard colleague (names deleted to protect the innocent):<br />X [very distinguished Harvard professor] asked me to see if he can get on your calendar to have a lunch with him and Y [another distinguished professor] in the near future. I say that of course, knowing that X&#8217;s calendar is incredibly complicated, but I am happy to try to offer times if you give me some of your calendar constraints.<br />Now wait a minute. Let me see if I get this straight. X would like to have lunch with me, but X, you see, is so-oo busy that it will be really tough to find room in his calendar for me, and even though maybe, just maybe, something will be possible, I shouldn&#8217;t get my hopes too high&#8230;?</p></blockquote>
<p>There are all sorts of interpretations, innocent or not, but I found the note incredibly funny.</p>
