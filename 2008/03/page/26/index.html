                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I know some conservatives are not exactly fond of James Carville.  But you have to feel for the man given the sheer stupidity of some of the things that his wife says.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/03/02/matalin-economy">Amanda</a> watched Mary Matalin on Meet the Press so we didn’t have to.  First – she claimed that most Americans are happy with their personal finances and when that was shot down as not being true, she blamed the press:</p>
<blockquote><p>MATALIN: Well, there’s an element of cognitive dissonance there, because if you ask them how their own personal finances are going, those numbers completely switch. Yes — he’s looking around. Those numbers are completely true. They absolutely switch on their own personal finances.<br />SHRUM: I think most people are getting very insecure about their personal finances.<br />MATALIN: That’s because they’re berated with these numbers.  However, we haven’t had the contrast yet. People do not want, as a furtherance of economic policy, the kind of centralization Obama and Hillary are proposing, they don’t want more regulations, they don’t want higher taxes, they don’t want less trade. Maybe there’s a way to help the transition in Ohio and Pennsylvania, those manufacturing states. But when you start contrasting liberal liberal liberal — redistributionist policies with limited government policies — the limited government conservative policies, economics win every time.</p></blockquote>
<p>Her husband to intervene with:</p>
<blockquote><p>CARVILLE: Of course it is, and people are feeling it. This is not something created by the media. These mortgages, these high energy costs, these pathetic employment numbers, the health care costs, food costs — they’re just killing people out there. They’re not just being told that things are terrible. They’re feeling this every day.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let’s talk numbers – shall we.  The employment-population ratio stands at 62.9% which is not only down from the 63.4% as of December 2006 but is very disappointing when compared to the employment-population ratio during Clinton’s second term, which was often 64% or above.  Real wages for production and nonsupervisory worker have been falling since September 2007 and is the same as it was back in September 2002.  Total real GDP over seven years has been only 18.1%.  This translates into an anemic 2.4% per year.  The annualized growth rate for the last quarter was only 0.6% so some fear a recession is imminent.  Finally, the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/income06.html">Census Bureau</a> reports that real median household income (2006$) has declined from $49,244 in 1999 to $48,201 in 2006.  So no – the facts are the reason why many feel their own well being is not doing that great.  </p>
<p>So what does Matalin do?  Certainly not talk about the facts.  She suggests that Democrats are trade protectionists.  Gee – I never knew her boss (Dick Cheney) was a Democrat.  After all, he was all in favor of those steel tariffs.  Higher taxes are likely a necessity given the $8.95 trillion Federal debt the Bush-Cheney had created as of October 31, 2007, which is projected to rise to $10.41 trillion by October 31, 2009 according to the Economic Report of the President.  That’s right, this report is forecasting a General Fund deficit over $700 billion for the current fiscal year and near $760 billion for the next year.  Why?  Those tax shifts in 2001 and 2003 that Matalin confuses with tax cuts for starters.  Also the Prescription Drug Benefit and Iraq War that the Bush-Cheney pushed – both of which means more taxes in the long-run.  </p>
<p>As far as “liberal liberal liberal — redistributionist policies”, what the heck is she referring to?  Could it be the not often mention desire of some conservatives to slash our Social Security benefits while maintaining high payroll taxes that will be converted from payroll contributions to employment taxes to bail out this General Fund disaster that Bush-Cheney created.  NOW – THAT’S REDISTRIBUTION!  </p>
<p>One has to wonder why Meet the Press bothers with guests like this.  But the executives at NBC have still not replaced Tim Russert as the host.</p>

                                <p>So says <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/business/02jobs.html">Mark Zandi</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Even as job growth accelerated in 2005 and 2006 before slowing last year, it was not enough to return the country to its previous level. Some 62.8 percent of all Americans age 16 and older were employed at the end of last year, down from the peak of 64.6 percent in early 2000, according to the Labor Department. “The economy never got its groove back after the tech bubble burst,” says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com “We’re still feeling fallout from the collapse of the tech economy and the accounting scandals. There are still psychological scars for the managers affected. Managers are less interested in taking risks.”</p></blockquote>
<p>It was nice touch by Peter S. Goodman to discuss the employment-population ratio.  Hat tip to <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/02/the-economy-never-really-got-its-groove-back">Paul Krugman</a> who writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>even during the best years of the “Bush boom,” the job market never got remotely as good as it was in the late 1990s. The official unemployment rate has been a deceptive indicator; the employment-population ratio has been a much better guide to how the economy feels.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul provides <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/01/04/employment-a-tale-of-two-administrations">this link</a> which shows the employment-population from 1993 to today.</p>

                                <p>The other point from my earlier chart on health care spending worth noting is that in the PCE data health care accounts for around 20% of consumer spending.  In contrast, medical care only has a weight of 6.2% in the CPI.  Since health care prices generally rise some two to three percentage points faster then overall inflation this implies that the CPI significantly understates reported inflation.  If the weight of medicine in the CPI were more like the weight in spending, the reported inflation rate would have been up to a full percentage point higher every year.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when I bring this point up to all the people who argue that the CPI overstates inflation they generally try to change the subject.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>According the the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/01/AR2008030100189.html?hpid=sec-business">Washington Post</a>, the GAO will shortly release a new report that consumer &#8220;banking fees are rising and are often undisclosed.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Banks are failing to provide consumers with information about fees on savings and checking accounts even though federal rules require such disclosures, according to a government report to be released tomorrow. </p>
<p>The report by the Government Accountability Office also says that some of the invisible fees have climbed substantially in recent years. The average overdraft fee, for instance, increased 11 percent from 2000 to 2007. </p>
<p>GAO staff members made undercover visits to 185 branches of 154 depository institutions throughout the country and were unable to get comprehensive lists of checking and savings account fees at more than a one-fifth of the locations. The information was not available on the Web sites of half of the institutions. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lack of transparency remains alive and well in our financial institutions. The squeeze is on.</p>
<p>Of particular interest are the comments following the article. On knowledgeable commentator, cleancut, notes that</p>
<blockquote><p>i work at a bank and that&#8217;s the line were suppose to give people who literally come to us crying because they were charged $200 in overdraft fees when they thought they had money. Another trick the banks use to maximize fees is by debiting your account from the greatest amount to the least. Once the large item is posted it will cause more of the smaller debits to cause overdrafts which generate more fees.</p></blockquote>
<p>But of course there are those who blame the victim (jayreal00)</p>
<blockquote><p>Couldn&#8217;t all this be avoided by people balancing their checkbooks? With online banking one can instantly check on his or her balance. The problems is Americans have bought into the credit culture. People try to game the system. It&#8217;s one of two things, people either know that they don&#8217;t have enough money in their account, buy something, hoping to put money in at a later time before the charge goes through. Or an individual has no idea how much is in the bank and just spends like it&#8217;s a credit card. Personally I don&#8217;t know which is worse but I have no sympathy. Banks have a right to charge these fees. However, it should be fully disclosed</p></blockquote>
<p>London Banker over at Roubini&#8217;s made a blistering attack on the American <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/245412/">psyche</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Miss America, the USA has become selfish, atomistic and isolated &#8211; hating everyone that fails or is different. </p>
<p>Europe is more generous, socialist (yes, I really used that word in a positive sense) and collective &#8211; embracing everyone who is weak and in need. </p>
<p>America imprisons 4 times as many of its own people. It denies healthcare to 45 million people. It treats the victims of Katrina as the enemy. America has rampant crime and murder. America has wars. America is gradually becoming a police/surveillance state. </p>
<p>Europe believes in society. Europe believes in the &#8220;common wealth&#8221;. In Europe you are not allowed to be rich, but everyone lives well. If the rich have to sacrifice to ensure that the poor have dignity, they will do it with a generous spirit. You underestimate Europe. America may have &#8220;Christianists&#8221;; Europe has christians. </p>
<p>When the bad times come, we will have cohesian in Europe. We will pull together, German and Spaniard, Norwegian and Italian. </p>
<p>Because we fear the alternative of division, hatred and war more than we fear embracing each other</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether London Banker is right about Europe or not&#8211;I am sure we will have lots of comments on that score (in a general sense, I think he is)&#8211;, what struck me were two words: <i>atomistic</i> and <i>isolated</i>.</p>
<p>Jayreal00 does blame the banks, but he is torn between blaming the banks and blaming the victim. Clearly, he is not monetarily sailing close to the wind. He sees himself, I suspect, as quite successful: An individual who is smart enough to weather the storms.</p>
<p>Now consider a silverlucie&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>I couldn&#8217;t agree with you more. Each of us is responsible for our finances. Banks cannot rip us off if we use them wisely. I have very little money, yet I have never had an overdraft fee. I use my credit card only for emergencies and only in the amount that I can pay for at the end of the month&#8230;I refuse to let the bank rip me off with finance charges. It&#8217;s not that hard&#8230;.stop going to discount stores for entertainment, spending money on junk that, once you get it home, is unsatisfying and unpaid for. It&#8217;s up to us, not the banks&#8230;who will rip us off at every turn, but only if we let them.</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, we have the individual who is smart enough to weather the latest storm; and, because she can weather it, she implicitly lays some of the blame on those who failed. She does not ask about their circumstances or even their abilities. She rises victorious and self-congratulatory, singing her own praises.</p>
<p>How do many of us view the world? What is our worldview? Do we see the world merely as a horrid contest, a kind of Darwinian struggle for individual survival? Is it neighbor against neighbor, village against village, company against company, country against country? Or do we see it as a collective endeavor?</p>
<p>Is London Banker right that we are atomistic, that we lack cohesion or generosity? In our drive for wealth, we celebrate individual successes&#8211;however small&#8211;are all too ready to kick the less fortunate? How did we view the victims of Katrina? Were they just too stupid to get out of the way? Is our debate over health care and social security, in some ways, another Katrina?</p>
<p>In small and innocuous ways and comments, we reveal ourselves to the world. How we respond to the latest financial dodge says a great deal about how we view the world, our values, our spirit, and our responsibilities to our neighbors.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/oil-price-surges-to-alltime-high-790077.html">Sean O’Grady</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gold hit a new high near $980 an ounce, and crude oil set an all-time high of above $103 a barrel – both beating the real-terms peaks reached in 1979-80.</p></blockquote>
<p>How does this $103 a barrel compare to the inflation-adjusted oil prices from around 1980?  <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/19/feeling-a-bit-peaked">Paul Krugman</a> provided a series in Feb. 2008 explaining his sources for data as:</p>
<blockquote><p>I took oil price and CPI data from FRED, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis database — an incredibly useful resource. I just guessed at 0.3 percent inflation for February, and used an oil price of $100 for the last data point.</p></blockquote>
<p>Using the approach, the April 1980 inflation-adjusted price was $103.24 so no real record just yet.  Oil prices may have increased by 160.76% but CPI increased by 161.37% over this period.</p>
<p>But suppose that we took nominal oil prices relative to the GDP deflator?  This deflator is reported only quarterly but from 1980QI to 2007QIV, its increase has only been 131%, which would suggest real prices are almost 13% higher than they were as of April 1980.  <a href="http://www.wtrg.com/prices.htm">WTRG Economics</a> present crude oil prices in “2006 dollars’ from 1869 to 2007. Their 1947 to 2007 graph can be seen <a href="http://www.wtrg.com/oil_graphs/oilprice1947.gif">here</a> with the peak price being less than $70 a barrel.  Since the price index for February 2008 is about 5% higher than it was for mid 2006, the 2006$ price of oil now is just under $100 a barrel.  The series that Paul used for the numerator and the series used by WTRG were different, which explains some of the differences in their graphs.  But I also suspect that WTRG used a different deflator such as the GDP deflator.  Since the CPI deflator has increased by more than the GDP deflator since 1980, folks that are making such intertemporal comparisons should be clear which one they have chosen to use.</p>
<p>As a side note, Paul linked to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/business/feeds/afx/2005/08/30/afx2195813.html">this 8/30/2005 article</a> where Steve Forbes predicted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Forbes said the high oil prices currently dampening the US economy, which peaked at more than 70 usd a barrel yesterday as Hurricane Katrina headed for the US Gulf Coast, would fall to 30-35 usd a barrel within a year. &#8216;I&#8217;ll make a bold prediction&#8230; in 12 months, you&#8217;re going to see oil down to 35-40 usd a barrel,&#8217; he said, according to Agence France-Presse. &#8216;It&#8217;s a huge bubble, I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s going to pop it but eventually it will pop &#8212; you cannot go against supply and demand, you cannot go against the fundamentals forever.&#8217;</p></blockquote>
<p>Oil prices were around $75 a barrel in August 2006.  OK, the January 2007 price was only $57 a barrel but the price has dramatically increased since then.  I’m not sure if Steve Forbes really understands the fundamentals of the oil market.</p>

This process can drag on much longer if the borrower attempts to make payments on the new schedule. Borrowers may drain other resources such as credit cards or retirement savings to postpone default.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Once the property becomes REO, the lender may not quickly and efficiently prepare it for sale. Most lenders do not have sufficient staff to deal with the large number of REOs they currently have, and the numbers are growing daily. Plus the loss mitigation procedures often demand higher prices for 90 days before the price cuts get more aggressive. Basically, it will take at least one year between the reset and the final sale in the open market, and 18 months is probably a more realistic timeframe.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The current REO pool is composed of those who gave up even before their loans reset. The huge number of resets and ensuing foreclosures is just now starting to hit the market. Today, we are beginning month 15 on the chart, but the impact on the market is at best in month 3 and more realistically, it is just now starting.</p></blockquote>
<p>Note &#8211; emphasis mine.</p>
<p>Anyway, my mostly uneducated guess (what little I know comes mostly from <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">Calculated Risk</a> and the Irvine Housing blog and my own limited observations about the market) is that there&#8217;s a long way to go. Across the street from our <strike>hovel</strike> apartment is <strike>another hovel</strike> a tiny home &#8211; one bathroom, two bedrooms, on a small lot. Sure, it was nicely remodeled, but this is Silver Lake, about ten minutes from downtown Los Angeles &#8211; a somewhat artsy bohemian community not located atop a newly discovered oil deposit. The current owners paid about $800K for it, a year ago. I imagine if it went on the market now, that price would be down at least $100K.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m wrong, but my mind simply doesn&#8217;t accept that the place across the street is worth more than $150K (in 2000 dollars). I figure when I see the house offered for that price, the market will be back to normal. And a lot of people are going to go through a lot of pain in the process.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>I was looking at some data yesterday and encountered a big surprise.  I suppose like almost everyone I was under the impression that health care spending was growing much faster then the economy and absorbing an ever growing share of resources.  This theme dominates much discussion of health care issues, particularly projections of the federal budget.  So I was very surprised to look at the data and find that this while this assumption was very valid from 1950 to the early 1990s, there was a very sharp break in trend in the early 1990s and health care spending relative to the rest of the economy slowed very sharply &#8212; see the chart.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8lnQV-OMbI/AAAAAAAAAIk/GfwoIphQNIE/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8lnQV-OMbI/AAAAAAAAAIk/GfwoIphQNIE/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>UPDATE: This data is from the GDP accounts and is PCE on health care services.  I went back to the data and found that drugs were not included.  Drugs were reported under nondurables.  So<br />here is what the data looks like when I add drugs into the data. It does not change my problem much.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8mPB1-OMeI/AAAAAAAAAI8/wm9Euhlil9k/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R8mPB1-OMeI/AAAAAAAAAI8/wm9Euhlil9k/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />This chart implies that despite the aging of the baby boomer generation that some of our fundamental thinking about the course of health care spending may be inaccurate.  This data raises some very important questions in my mind that maybe some readers of this blog that are more knowledgeable may be able to answer.  Part of the answer appears to be that the rate of price increases in health care has slowed sharply.</p>

<p>update:  The other interesting point is that the creation of Medicare in the 1960s did not appear to impact the trend that had already been in place since 1950, long before Medicare was created.</p>
