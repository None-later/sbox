<p>Noni Mausa</p>
<p>These labels having to do with styles of government are tossed about like so many crunchy croutons in our discussions, but without anything resembling solid definitions.  So we argue back and forth and never get anywhere.  We roll up our sleeves in the morning, shout &#8220;Tastes great!!&#8221;  &#8221; Less filling!!&#8221; at each other till midnight, and then go to bed, grumbling at our obviously stupid and clueless colleagues.</p>
<p>Life&#8217;s too short for mud-wrestling like this.  Ipso fatso I invite your preliminary definitions – we can mud-wrestle over them till they suit us, and then hopefully use them as a handy reference. </p>
<p>Some factors I think are necessary to consider are:</p>
<p>Currency and Taxes<br />Information Control<br />Children, relatives and marriage<br />Rule of Law<br />Death &#8212; who gets to administer it without reprisals<br />Separations – church/state,  business/state, church/business<br />Cui bono – the Gini coefficient<br />Education and trasining<br />Freedom of movement of citizens<br />Freedom of movement of visitors</p>
<p>and I am sure there are more.</p>
<p>Let the delineation begin!</p>

<p>There I was holding my head and moaning and crying about how the banking system and the financial system were on the verge of collapse.  I saw the forced marriage, or ménage-a-deux, between JP Morgan and Bear Stearns. </p>
<p>But the Fed was involved, which couldn’t be good.  Oh God, please help us.</p>
<p>Then I realized it was really a ménage-a-trois, what with the head of JP Morgan being on the <a href="http://www.ny.frb.org/aboutthefed/orgchart/board/dimon.html">board of directors</a> of the New York Fed.  It was a family affair.  The family was taking care of its own.  Brilliant.  I’m now free of stress and ready to get back to the trough!  Get out your wallets, oinkers.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/us/26baltimore.html?pagewanted=2&#038;_r=1&#038;th&#038;emc=th">The NYT</a> carries a story about forclosures in a Baltimore neighborhood, and an outreach program to help people save their homes.  I have quoted the part that interests me.</p>
<blockquote><p>Statistics on foreclosure are snapshots of a moving phenomenon, and data from the state labor department show 174 foreclosures in Belair-Edison last year, while the Community Law Center, a nonprofit public service group, counted 181; both figures are well below the more than 275 foreclosures in 2001 and in 2002. Because of a difference in counting the 2006 figures, the state number represents an increase in 2007, but a decline over several years. Both agencies attribute the discrepancy to the inexact nature of counting foreclosures.</p>
<p>In the foreclosure crisis, lenders and borrowers both say the other has missed opportunities to save troubled loans. Lenders, who say they lose tens of thousands of dollars on every foreclosure, estimate that half of borrowers facing foreclosure never contact their lender, and many avoid the lender’s calls or letters. In turn, housing advocates say lenders are reluctant or unable to modify loans. A survey by Moody’s Investors Service found that 16 large servicers of subprime mortgages modified only 1 percent of loans that adjusted during three months studied last year. </p>
<p>“People are calling and they can’t get through to anyone at the servicer, and time is running out,” Mr. Perez said.</p>
<p>Both sides are hurt by this impasse. </p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>On a recent Saturday morning, he led 11 aspiring first-time home buyers in a five-hour homeownership workshop. If they also attend his one-on-one counseling, they can qualify for up to $10,000 in public and private aid for down payments and closing costs. </p>
<p>In private, Mr. Miller talks forcefully about the predatory loans he has seen in this neighborhood. But to the class, he took a different tack. </p>
<p>“When people say it’s the banks, or it’s the lenders, or it’s the real estate agents — it’s not their fault. You’re the one who said, ‘I want it.’ ”</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://registeredrep.com/mag/finance_brokers_part_gdp/">FIRE</a> reports:<br />
<blockquote>“The securities industry is an economic powerhouse that continues to strengthen the U.S. economy,” said Securities Industry Association President Marc Lackritz. “SIA data shows that last year alone, we raised a record $3.2 trillion of capital for American business and nearly $14 trillion over the past five, underscoring our substantial contribution to overall growth in the U.S. economy.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Also fatbear in comments earlier offers this link by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/21/opinion/21krugman.html">Paul Krugman</a> on the OCC and <a href="http://www.ots.treas.gov/">Office for Thrift Supervision</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Just go read Krugman from right before Xmas last year:<br />Consider the press conference held on June 3, 2003 — just about the time subprime lending was starting to go wild — to announce a new initiative aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on banks. Representatives of four of the five government agencies responsible for financial supervision used tree shears to attack a stack of paper representing bank regulations. The fifth representative, James Gilleran of the Office of Thrift Supervision, wielded a chainsaw.<br />Also in attendance were representatives of financial industry trade associations, which had been lobbying for deregulation. As far as I can tell from press reports, there were no representatives of consumer interests on the scene.<br />Two months after that event the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, one of the tree-shears-wielding agencies, moved to exempt national banks from state regulations that protect consumers against predatory lending. If, say, New York State wanted to protect its own residents — well, sorry, that wasn’t allowed.<br />One thing to remember is the the state subsidiaries of the national banks, many of the them state based mortgage companies, were also exempt from state regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another thing to remember is the lack of resources to even monitor the new market, as <a href="http://www.consumersunion.org/pub/core_financial_services/000770.html">Consumers Union</a> points out.</p>
<blockquote><p>Even if the OCC had a desire to effectively regulate the consumer practices of national banks, it lacks the resources to do so. According to the OCC’s own statistics, there are about 2,200 nationally chartered banks, with total assets of $3.5 trillion. The entire staff of the OCC is less than 3,000, which is less than one person per $1 billion in bank assets. Even if the OCC did vigorously develop new consumer protection regulations, which it does not, the OCC does not have enough staff to detect and prevent problems for consumers at big and small nationally chartered banks throughout the U.S. is the resources of the agency as they took on added responsibilities&#8230;&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.gao.gov/htext/d06387.html">GAO</a> weighed in rather obliquely on the issue.</p>
<p>We shall see how it all shakes out, but remember, do not exclude externalities, which our economic models <strong>exclude</strong> from serious price adjusting. But that is a different story for 19th century philosophy. It just means we do not even try to validate the model in the 21st century. Whatever happened to innovation in economic philosophy?</p>

Mark points out that Wolf Blitzer is also responsible for CNN turning itself into an on-air version of the National Review.  Maybe Wolf wants to become another Tim Russert.  In addition to CNN’s stupidity on this issue, Mark treats us to some wisdom from <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5c1de912-fc05-11dc-9229-000077b07658.html">John Shilling</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The first American baby boomers have now become eligible to retire and start drawing on Social Security, the government pension programme. Many politicians are telling us that the resulting rise in Social Security “entitlement” payments will break the budget, so we have to cut benefits to retired people. But the politicians do not want to mention that the Social Security system has been compiling a huge surplus. Why? Because they have been using that surplus for years to hide the real size of the current federal budget deficit, allowing them to spend more and justify tax cuts for the wealthy.  US Office of Management and Budget data show that while government’s reported deficit averaged about $300bn a year from 2002 to 2006 – roughly $4,000 per household – the real current deficit was actually more than 50 per cent bigger. The government just “borrowed” about $165bn from the Social Security Trust Fund every year – under the table.  In 2007, the real deficit was $449bn according to the OMB. However, the “official” deficit widely reported is only $257bn, because it is government policy to add the borrowed Social Security Trust Fund surplus ($192bn in 2007) to revenues before calculating the “official” deficit that has to be borrowed publicly. The recently passed economic stimulus package of $160bn is reported to raise the 2008 official deficit to about $400bn. But the real deficit in 2008 will be about $600bn.  How does this work? Social Security was initially a pay-as-you-go system – annual payroll taxes of workers covered that year’s payments to retired people. By the early 1980s, however, it was clear that this system was not sustainable. Payments were increasing faster than revenues, and when the baby boomers started retiring and collecting pensions, there would be huge shortfalls. President Ronald Reagan had the prudence to address this problem early enough to make Social Security sustainable. He appointed Alan Greenspan to design a massive overhaul of the system, which was implemented. Social Security was in effect transformed into a national pension plan. Social Security payroll taxes were raised, creating a surplus in the trust fund that would fully cover the future costs of baby-boomer retirement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Some of us praised what President Reagan did.  Too bad his party wishes to dishonor the 1983 Social Security reform in order to convert the payroll contributions into a backdoor employment tax increase to pay for reductions in the income tax rate and tax breaks for capital income.  And the worse part is how the modern GOP and their minions invent all sorts of distortions to fog over this agenda.  Shilling continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>Baby boomers, and all others who have worked since 1983, paid in more than needed for Social Security retirement payments. They saved and created the trust fund surplus, which now amounts to more than $2,000bn and must be invested in US Treasury bonds. It is projected to reach nearly $3,000bn in 10 years. Then Social Security will stop generating a surplus to subsidise the rest of the budget and will begin redeeming its bonds to help make payments. Current projections show that the trust fund bonds may be exhausted by about 2041. The trust fund’s full sustainability for at least the next 75 years could be restored easily with minor adjustments, including restoring the income cap to 90 per cent, according to the recently retired commissioner of the Social Security Administration . Politicians understand that, with the Social Security Trust Fund surplus declining, they will no longer be able to borrow from them under the table while announcing fictitiously smaller deficits to justify continued expenditures and tax cuts. And they will have to generate funds from other sources of revenue to redeem the bonds after 2017. Rather than admit too much was borrowed recently, and must now be repaid, they want to reduce Social Security benefits. This puts much of the burden on the middle class, who created most of the surplus that has been used to hide the real size of the deficits. Fundamentally, the Social Security issue is not one of “entitlements” but of the obligation of our government to honour its debt and not reduce Social Security benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>Simply put – someone will have to pay more in taxes to pay for all those wars a President McCain will wish to wage.  My problem with John McCain is that he refuses to consider raising income taxes as he would prefer a rather dishonest backdoor increase in employment taxes.</p>

<blockquote><p>Why, some wonder, is the U.S. closer to the Iran-backed ISCI and Badr Brigades than it is with the Sadrites? Why does this make sense? Two Baghdad political veterans have ruefully pointed out to Abu Muqawama that while Sadr has more popular support, the ISCI crowd have something more valuable: they speak English. One former State Department veteran with whom Abu Muqawama spoke a few months ago pointed out that former Iraq honcho Meghan O&#8217;Sullivan was particularly vulnerable to falling under the sway of those politicians who didn&#8217;t just speak in that confusing gutteral language where they write from right to left in co-joined letters. Ergo: they speak English, so they must be our friends! Hoo-ray, democracy!</p></blockquote>
<p>Surprised?  Why?  At one point, the neocons were all giddy that the new Iraqi government had adopted the supply-side philosophy of the Flat Tax.  Being ruled by idiots is one thing – but allowing these idiots to have us go to war and get stuck in such a quagmire is just un-American.  </p>
<p>Brad once again calls for Bush’s impeachment.  Fellows?  We should have listened to Brad years ago when it first called for this.  Now – it’s a tad late.</p>

J. Chivers, Eric Schmitt and Nicholas Wood:</p>
<blockquote><p>Since 2006, when the insurgency in Afghanistan sharply intensified, the Afghan government has been dependent on American logistics and military support in the war against Al Qaeda and the Taliban.</p>
<p>But to arm the Afghan forces that it hopes will lead this fight, the American military has relied since early last year on a fledgling company led by a 22-year-old man whose vice president was a licensed masseur.</p>
<p>With the award last January of a federal contract worth as much as nearly $300 million, the company, AEY Inc., which operates out of an unmarked office in Miami Beach, became the main supplier of munitions to Afghanistan’s army and police forces.</p>
<p>Since then, the company has provided ammunition that is more than 40 years old and in decomposing packaging, according to an examination of the munitions by The New York Times and interviews with American and Afghan officials. Much of the ammunition comes from the aging stockpiles of the old Communist bloc, including stockpiles that the State Department and NATO have determined to be unreliable and obsolete, and have spent millions of dollars to have destroyed.</p>
<p>In purchasing munitions, the contractor has also worked with middlemen and a shell company on a federal list of entities suspected of illegal arms trafficking.</p>
<p>Moreover, tens of millions of the rifle and machine-gun cartridges were manufactured in China, making their procurement a possible violation of American law. The company’s president, Efraim E. Diveroli, was also secretly recorded in a conversation that suggested corruption in his company’s purchase of more than 100 million aging rounds in Albania, according to audio files of the conversation.</p>
<p>This week, after repeated inquiries about AEY’s performance by The Times, the Army suspended the company from any future federal contracting, citing shipments of Chinese ammunition and claiming that Mr. Diveroli misled the Army by saying the munitions were Hungarian.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Emphasis mine.)</p>
<p>I guess this is what less regulation means.  And it reminds me of <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/12/government-private-sector-chocolate.html">my favorite</a> among the posts I&#8217;ve written.</p>

<blockquote><p>Thousands of supporters of the powerful Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr and his Mahdi Army militia took to the streets of Baghdad on Thursday to protest the Iraqi Army’s assault on the southern port city of Basra, as intense fighting continued there for a third day.  In Basra, there seemed to be no breakthrough in the fighting by either side. As much as half of the city remained under militia control, hospitals in some parts of the city were reported full, and the violence continued to spread. Clashes were reported all over the city and in locations 12 miles south of Basra. The Iraqi Army’s offensive in Basra is an important political test for the government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki and for American strategy in Iraq. President Bush sought to portray the fighting in a positive light on Thursday, declaring the offensive by Mr. Maliki’s government a “bold decision.” But if the army’s assault in Basra leads the Mahdi Army to break completely with its current cease-fire, which has helped to tamp down attacks in Iraq during the past year, there is a risk of escalating violence and of replaying 2004. That year, the militia fought intense battles with American forces that destabilized the entire country. As a possible sign of the rising instability in the region, saboteurs blew up one of Iraq’s two main oil export pipelines from Basra, Reuters reported. The oil pipelines were regular targets for insurgents earlier in the Iraqi conflict, but Thursday’s sabotage was the first time in several years that the southern oil supply route had been disrupted, and oil prices rose briefly after the attack. In a speech at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio, Mr. Bush said Mr. Maliki’s decision to wage the offensive “shows his leadership and his commitment to enforce the law in an evenhanded manner.”</p></blockquote>
<p>President Bush appears to be clueless.  <a href="http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/03/todays_must_read_303.php">Paul Kiel</a> may be able to assist:</p>
<blockquote><p>For years, Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr&#8217;s Mahdi Army was one of the main destabilizing forces in Iraq. But last summer, he agreed to a cease fire, a move that everyone agrees has done a tremendous amount to diminish the violence in recent months. He renewed the cease fire last month.  But Sadr&#8217;s group has splintered. And Shiite militias, some connected to Sadr and some not, have been mixing it up in the southern city of Basra. The British handed over control of the province to the Iraqi government in December, and things have been downhill since then.  For weeks (or months), Iraqi forces (with U.S. encouragement) have planned an offensive to reclaim Basra from these rogue militias. Besides the violence, there&#8217;s the problem of corrupt militias having control of the city&#8217;s valuable ports. And as the Iraqi general in charge of southern Iraq argued, the militias has to be moved out before the elections this fall, or they might forever take hold.  So the offensive was finally launched this week, with Iraqi forces moving in on the ground with British and U.S. support by air. It came as a surprise to no one, even Sadr&#8217;s people, one of whom tells The Los Angeles Times that Sadr has initially agreed to support the crackdown, provided that it targeted &#8216;outlaws.'&#8221;  But now Mahdi representatives say that the offensive is not so &#8220;targeted.&#8221; And Sadr issued a statement two weeks ago permitting the Mahdi Army to fire on U.S. and Iraqi forces in self-defense. So no matter the talk of &#8220;outlaws,&#8221; everyone perceives this as a hit against Sadr. So now it&#8217;s chaos, as the operation deepens in Basra and there are clashes in Baghdad &#8212; where the Iraqi forces are also attacking &#8220;special groups&#8221; (as an American official calls them, meaning Shiite militias with Iranian backing) with American support. Shiite insurgents have responded in part by firing rockets into the Green Zone. There&#8217;s also a good deal of violence between the rival Shiite militias in Baghdad and elsewhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, Sadr was willing to work with the current government but Maliki say this as opportunity to crush Sadr.  This appears to be very destabilizing with much of the real reporting being put forward over at the blog of <a href="http://www.juancole.com/">Juan Cole</a>.  Iraq may be heading for civil war and with the inept leadership of George W. Bush, our hands will be stained with the ensuing blood.  Why we didn’t leave Iraq a couple of years ago is beyond me.  Oh yea – now I remember.  We as a people were stupid enough to give Bush-Cheney a second term.</p>

                                <p>Is <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/03/26/beck.deficit/index.html">CNN</a> trying to imitate the National Review?  If not, why let a village idiot like Glenn Beck write something on Social Security?</p>
<blockquote><p>Let&#8217;s say a giant asteroid was headed toward Earth right now and experts say it has a good chance of ending civilization as we know it. Let&#8217;s also say that we&#8217;ve known about this asteroid for years but even as it gets closer and closer our leaders do nothing … Let me give you three numbers that will put this economic asteroid into perspective: $200 billion, $14.1 trillion, and $53 trillion.<br />$200 billion is the approximate total amount of write-downs announced so far as a result of the current credit crisis. </p>
<p>$14.1 trillion is the size of the entire U.S. economy </p>
<p>And $53 trillion is (drum roll please) the approximate size of this country&#8217;s bill for the Social Security and Medicare promises we&#8217;ve made. <br />While no one will ever mistake me for Alan Greenspan, it seems to me that the third number is quite a bit larger than the other two. It also seems very few people care.  According to the latest Social Security and Medicare Trustees report (and I use that term loosely since it has the word &#8220;trust&#8221; in it) released earlier this week, the economic asteroid will first make impact in the year 2019 when the Medicaid trust fund becomes insolvent.  Only an immediate 122 percent increase in Medicaid taxes and a 26 percent increase in Social Security taxes can prevent (or more likely, delay) its impact.</p></blockquote>
<p>Glenn clearly did not read <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/social-security-rehashing-white-house.html">what I wrote</a> but he should have read what <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/look-and-feel-15-years-younger">Paul Krugman</a> wrote.  Had he done so, he would have realized that the estimated long-run shortfall fell.  Or maybe Glenn should have read what <a href="http://www.capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/193/if-its-spring-there-must-be-trustees-report">Andrew Samwick</a> noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>Picking up on Pete&#8217;s post about the 2008 Trustees Report, I always go first to this table, Table IV.B7, which shows the present value of Social Security&#8217;s unfunded obligations over an infinite horizon.  The number is $13.6 trillion, or 3.2% of taxable payroll or 1.1% of gross domestic product over the same horizon.</p></blockquote>
<p>$13.6 trillion does not sound as bad as $53 trillion and 3.2% is a far cry from 26%.  Speaking of Paul and asteroids, let’s recall <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/03/paul_krugman_on.html">this insight</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sometimes you really have to wonder. It should be obvious that the Social Security Administration’s estimate of the growth of unfunded liabilities says nothing – nothing at all – about the cost of delaying a “fix”, whatever that might mean. But it seems that even many economists – to say nothing of Joe Lieberman – don’t get it.  So here’s an example, to illustrate the point.  Suppose that an asteroid is bearing down on our planet. If nothing is done, it will strike in 2019, inflicting $20 trillion in losses. At a nominal interest rate of 5 percent, that’s a present value of $10 trillion.  If we do nothing about the asteroid, by next year the present value of the future losses from the asteroid strike will be $10.5 trillion. So the “unfunded liability” from the asteroid strike rises by $500 billion a year.  Suppose that there is a way to fix the problem: we can send Bruce Willis into space to blow up the asteroid. So here’s the question: if we wait a year to send Bruce Willis into space, does that cost $500 billion?  Of course not: it could cost either more or less. If waiting a year means that we’ve lost our last chance to stop the asteroid, it costs $10 trillion – the full present value of the avoidable losses the asteroid would inflict. On the other hand, if Bruce Willis can still blow up the asteroid next year (or any year before 2019), there is no cost at all to waiting. In fact, if waiting increases the Willis expedition’s chances of success, there’s a benefit to delay.  In other words, the $500 billion increase in the present value of the future costs from the asteroid says nothing about the costs of delaying action. All it says is that the future is getting closer.  The same is true for Social Security.</p></blockquote>
<p>But of course, Glenn Beck would not know this.  After all, he does not appear to have read anything on this topic from intelligent folks like Andrew Samwick and Paul Krugman.  So pray tell – why did CNN ask him to write on a topic that he is so utterly clueless about?</p>
