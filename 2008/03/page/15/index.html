<blockquote><p>NEW YORK (Reuters) &#8211; Bear Stearns Cos (BSC.N: Quote, Profile, Research) Chief Executive Alan Schwartz on Wednesday dismissed recurring speculation that the investment bank faces a cash crunch, saying it has hefty cash reserves that have remained little changed this year.</p>
<p>Schwartz, in a televised interview on CNBC, also said he is comfortable with the range of analysts&#8217; earnings estimates for the fiscal first quarter ended Feb. 29. Results for the quarter are due next week.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t see any pressure on our liquidity, let alone a liquidity crisis,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Bear finished fiscal 2007 with $17 billion of cash sitting at the parent company level as a &#8220;liquidity cushion,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That cushion has been virtually unchanged. We have $17 billion or so excess cash on the balance sheet,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Schwartz denied speculation that other brokers were turning down Bear&#8217;s credit on trades for fear of counter-party risk.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s been a lot of volatility in the market, a lot of disruption. That&#8217;s causing some administrative pressure, getting trades settled. We&#8217;re in constant dialogue with all the major dealers, and I have not been made aware of anybody not taking our credit,&#8221; he said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that the stock is below $35, will they claim simple Herstatt risk for the transaction?</p>

                                <p>Reader Peter sends a link to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7296678.stm">this article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>JP Morgan Chase will provide the money to Bear Stearns for 28 days with the Federal Reserve of New York&#8217;s backing.</p>
<p>JP Morgan is also trying to get long-term financing for Bear Stearns. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>BBC business editor Robert Peston said that the move by JP Morgan and the Fed of New York was essentially a central bank bailout.</p>
<p>&#8220;In just the last 24 hours Bear Stearns came close to running out of the cash or liquidity it needs to meet its daily requirements,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;So enter the US Federal Reserve. It is promising to supply whatever liquidity is required by JP Morgan Chase, the leading bank, to help Morgan provide whatever funds are required by Bear Stearns.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since JP Morgan is saying there is no risk to its shareholders, this represents a central bank bailout of Bear Stearns.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is America&#8217;s Northern Rock.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Emphasis mine.  As I mentioned in recent posts, the Fed has been slowly upping the, ahem, assistance its offering to the banks that have done the most to create this mess, and each step along the way, in addition to being larger than the one before, is more opaque.  I hadn&#8217;t anticipated this though &#8211; the Fed is essentially give something (what?) to JP Morgan Chase for JP Morgan Chase to help Bear Stearns.  (You don&#8217;t think JP Morgan Chase is doing any of this out of the kindness of its heart, do you?)  Essentially, this makes it very, very hard to figure out what the size of the give-away to Bear Stearns.  </p>
<p>So&#8230;</p>
<p>1.  What is it that JP Morgan Chase is going to get out of this?  <br />2.  What is Step 7 going to be?  I.e., what&#8217;s the next thing the Fed is going to try to save <a href="http://www.forbes.com/lists/2006/54/biz_06rich400_James-Cayne_UBGJ.html">this man&#8217;s retirement package</a> at the expense of the long term health of the economy when this fails?</p>

<p>n the midst of a recession and severe crisis in government funding which is producing huge deficits at the Federal level, we find that <a href="http://news.google.com/news/url?sa=t&#038;ct=us/1x-0&#038;fp=47da980b10c510c1&#038;ei=qknaR9LECIPkqgOzm8nnBw&#038;url=http%3A//www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-na-earmarks14mar14%2C1%2C7907222.story&#038;cid=1141218338">Senators can&#8217;t lop off those earmarks</a>.  Can’t or won’t?</p>
<p>Whether you’re generally liberal or generally conservative, there is something grotesque about Bridges to Nowhere.  While this country may well need some large spending programs to upgrade and improve our national infrastructure and water systems, there is no “need” &#8211; other than selfish self-aggrandizement – for pet projects that do not benefit the entire United States. </p>
<p>Pet projects that lift money from the public Treasury are affronts to the democratic process and equal rights, and divert cash from taxpayers and from more widely useful projects and needs.  The election of 2006 was publicized as a way to change the ways of Washington, including the disgusting number of pork barrel earmark projects.  The Democrats swore this was their program, and that they would overturn the wasteful practice.  They lied.</p>
<p>No wonder the number of citizens who register to vote as Independent is exploding, and will continue to increase.  The two political parties are corrupt and it will take a Hercules to clean these stables.  In the meantime, every horse that comes out of these stables to run for office is suspect, and rightly so.</p>
<blockquote><p>”WASHINGTON &#8212; Even the entreaties of the three senators running for president weren&#8217;t enough to persuade their colleagues Thursday to curb their appetite for earmarks &#8212; the practice of designating federal dollars for pet projects.</p>
<p>“Senators soundly rejected a one-year moratorium backed by the presidential hopefuls &#8212; Republican John McCain and Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton &#8212; even though it put senators from both parties at odds with their presidential contenders.</p>
<p>“The vote &#8212; 29 in favor of the proposal, 71 opposed &#8212; again demonstrated the enduring popularity of earmarks, even though they have figured prominently in recent congressional scandals, including one that landed former Rep. Randy &#8220;Duke&#8221; Cunningham of Rancho Santa Fe in prison.</p>
<p>“A number of Republicans believe that the explosion of earmarks while they controlled Congress &#8212; from 1,439 in 1995 to nearly 14,000 in 2005 &#8212; contributed to their losing the majority in 2006. Now those legislators are attacking the practice to help restore their party&#8217;s reputation for fiscal discipline.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yoo hoo, Washington! Your behavior is going to have to change.</p>

                                <p>Shanea Watkins, at Heritage, writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>On March 5, the House Budget Committee passed its fiscal year 2009 budget resolution. If implemented, it would increase taxes significantly, thus decreasing job growth, reducing disposable income, and weakening the economy. This WebMemo projects the likely impact of the House budget resolution on the tax burden, jobs, and economic growth in states and congressional districts.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The House budget resolution has the potential to cost the average American taxpayer more than $2,000 in additional taxes in 2012 alone. Higher taxes, particularly on capital, cause the level of private investment to fall, thereby slowing productivity improvements and weakening the earning capacity of households. Wages and business earnings, which are closely tied to productivity, would fall as well. As a result of the tax increases implicit in the House budget resolution, Americans could also see their personal income decrease by an average of $1,767 due to a weaker economy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the budget resolution could damage employment growth, causing about one million fewer jobs to be created, and could lower economic output by more than $100 billion compared to what it would have been; the average cost to congressional districts could be 2,191 lost jobs and $247 million in economic output.</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s also some tables showing how much each state and congressional district is going to get messed up by these vile actions that Congress is taking.  But wait&#8230;  how do we know about these horrible consequences?  (I&#8217;m assuming her caveat about &#8220;potential to cost&#8221; goes by the wayside.  It seems to be glossed over quickly, but its pretty clear Watkins is certain this is going to hurt us bad.) </p>
<p>
<blockquote>Analysts in the Center for Data Analysis (CDA) at The Heritage Foundation used two models to develop estimates of how the Bush tax cuts likely affect the U.S. economy. They used the CDA Microsimulation Tax Model and the U.S. Macroeconomic Model of Global Insight Inc., a leading economic consulting company.  Estimates were projected to 2012 because that is the first full year when all of the tax provisions of the budget resolution will be in effect.  These projections assume normal levels of economic, population, and employment growth over the next five years.</p></blockquote>
<p>I crunch numbers and build models for a living.  (Anyone need a consultant?  Drop me a line!)  As I type this, I&#8217;m running a simulation in a model I&#8217;m building for a client on another machine&#8230;  I have about five minutes until it finishes its run and I can look at what it spits out and figure out where to go from here. (If you&#8217;re wondering, yes, much much of my writing takes place while waiting to see some results.  Five minutes here, five minutes there, and voila, a post&#8230; or a chapter in my book.)  So when I see mention of models, especially when those models spit out results that I&#8217;m not sure I buy, I&#8217;m interested. </p>
<p>Neither model is explained in any more detail in the rest of the post, so I went looking around to see what I can learn.  If you google <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=%22CDA+Microsimulation+Tax+Model%22&#038;btnG=Google+Search">&#8220;CDA Microsimulation Tax Model&#8221;</a> you find precisely two entries &#8211; one to Watkins&#8217; post, and an ad in Job Openings for Economists where they&#8217;re looking for someone to maintain the model.  Leave out the quotes and you get more hits &#8211; most don&#8217;t have anything to do with this model, and those that do come from other folks quoting Heritage, including such reputable organizations as Free Republic. </p>
<p>Global Insight is a reasonably well known consulting firm&#8230; and I found a bit more information searching online.  Basically, it seems the model has about 1200 equations.. exactly what they are isn&#8217;t clear, since from what I can tell after a short search, the model is proprietary.</p>
<p>Now, this is policy that Heritage is peddling.  Which means, they should try to be as transparent as possible, especially since they&#8217;re operating with a known bias.  Which means that even if Global Insight&#8217;s model is proprietary, one would expect Heritage to make its model available.  (Can anyone think of any reason why a policy think tank would keep its model proprietary?)  At the very least, if I&#8217;m expected to accept the results of these models, I would expect to see the following:</p>
<p>1.  A description of the results the model spit out in times past.  For example, what happens when you pump in data available through the end of 1992, and the information about the 1993 tax hike?  What about when you put in information available through the end of 2000, and information about the 2001 and 2002 and 2003 tax cuts?  Does it tell you what happened with any degree of accuracy?   If not, why not?</p>
<p>2.  A description of the assumptions that went into the model. </p>
<p>I note that Watkins is very, very open about how results spit out by the model at the national level were allocated across states and Congressional districts, which is quite admirable.  But it only makes me wonder that much more why we&#8217;re supposed to take the model itself, the model on which all her striking results are based, on faith.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Hoisted from comments, this from Andrew:</p>
<blockquote><p>I was in Al Kut in May of 2003. Our command had set up their headquarters in a hotel here without clearing the city of resistance. This hotel had been surrounded by hundreds of screaming Iraqis. </p>
<p>My unit was on the outskirts of town, fighting Fedayeen holdouts and destroying weapons caches, when we were called to bust up the siege on the ill conceived command headquarters (evidently the hotel had hot tubs).</p>
<p>When we arrived, ready for all hell to break loose, our translator informed us that the crowd was screaming their support of the American liberators, and posed no threat. (foolish pride insists I insert here that I was in the Marine Corps, and the Army command perceived the crowd as a threat).</p>
<p>I share this experience to depict the real support we had at the beginning of this nightmare, and where our leadership has taken us. The citizens of Al Kut were kissing our feet when we got there. Thanks to the profoundly moronic guidance of this administration, every bit of that goodwill has been squandered.</p>
<p>It is the same direction this administration has taken us at home. 9/11 gave the President a country united. Imagine what a gifted leader could have done with that! Instead we have been dragged through this Rovian nightmare of incessant division. All politics and no policy. I only hope we (and Iraq) can recover.</p></blockquote>
<p>I did the adjunct Professor for a number of years, and had a number of students who either were sent to or had come back from the happy adventures in Afghanistan and Iraq.  One of them, a captain told me something which I think explains the whole mess perfectly.  (I&#8217;ve written about this before, so long time readers may find it familiar.)  </p>
<p>It seems that he was in charge of a unit operating in Anbar early on.  His duties included meeting with the local sheikhs.  Every single one of the local sheikhs, every single one, told him the same thing:  they were ready to cooperate fully with the US Military, but they were afraid of a certain man, who they expected to come and try to slaughter them all.  The captain informed all the sheikhs that his men would fight to defend them from this man, to the death if necessary.  (Apparently Iraqis like grandiose statements.)  </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the captain got in touch with his peers in the region &#8211; captains and majors in the Army and the Marine Corps &#8211; and they were all saying the same thing:  the fear of this one bad man was palpable, and everywhere in the region.  </p>
<p>But who was this demon?  The sheikhs would say only that the man was a powerful and vicious warlord from up north.  The captain sent inquiries up the chain of command, but heard nothing back.  Eventually, one of his men, searching on the internet, found out who Jalal Talibani is.  </p>
<p>Now, this is not to say that Talibani is a vicious monster.  But wouldn&#8217;t it have helped a great deal for our commanders on the ground to have something to say to the locals about him (e.g., he&#8217;s our puppet and he&#8217;s not what you&#8217;ve heard), especially before the guy became State President of Iraq? </p>
<p>Which leads to one more comment.  My grandfather was a lowly tank driver when he toured Europe from June of 1944 to mid-1945.  Since he spoke Yiddish, he became the de facto liaison guy for his unit &#8211; every time his unit took a German town, he would meet the burgermeister and other local worthies and explain that the REMFs would be following in a day or two to explain how things were going to be, but in the meantime, there was to be quiet and no resistance or General Patton would be very unhappy, and nobody wants to make General Patton unhappy.  He (and everyone else in the unit) was given precise instructions on what to say to the locals, what not to say, and how to treat them.  Despite the fact that my grandfather was in a front-line unit (at one point, I believe his battalion had the record for the most days of continuous front-line combat of any comparably sized American unit in any war the US has ever been involved in), eh was also provided with the names of the local worthies, and as much other information about them as possible.</p>
<p>I would expect the American military of today to be able to provide better intelligence to mid-level officers after &#8220;major combat combat operations&#8230;.  have ended&#8221; in 2003 and 2004 then they provided to a tank driver in 1944 and 1945.  That this expectation is incorrect is part of the part of the problem our troops face now, and the fault of the folks at the top.</p>

The militias in Anbar have done the same.</p>
<blockquote><p>Violence erupted once again in central and southern Iraq as heavily armed Shiite militia groups battle with police and army over control of residential quarters. </p>
<p>The most ferocious clashes are reported to be taking place in the Province of Wasit of which the city of Kut is the capital. </p>
<p>Police sources in Kut say the Mahdi Army, the military army of the Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, has driven police forces from city.</p>
<p>The clashes follow orders from Sadr to permit his militias to carry arms and defend themselves. This is the first breach of the six-month truce he and U.S. commanders had agreed upon.</p>
<p>So far the fighting has involved his militias and Iraqi forces. But the latest clashes in Kut prove that Iraqi troops are no match for Sadr’s heavily armed militia. </p>
<p>Police and security forces have fled the city and are reported to be regrouping for a counter attack.</p>
<p>Iraqi troops have asked for reinforcements but it is not clear whether U.S. occupation troops will interfere.</p></blockquote>

<p>The explanation is a narrative and has many links.  However, it needs to be read over there, as I do not know how to break it into parts. The size and scope of new world banks interventions in the US dilemma is well developed for a short article.  It is also his area of particular knowledge.</p>

<p>·       The Company’s 2008 customer loyalty performance, weighted at 20%, based upon a proprietary rating system designed by the Company and an outside vendor. </p>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120527998662928743.html?mod=hps_us_whats_news">Wall Street Journal&#8217;s Robin Sidel</a> explains that home equity credit lenders are stuck in a tough place when homeowners start defaulting.<br />While banks can foreclose on a first-lien mortgage, lenders often have little recourse when trying to collect a delinquent home-equity loan, especially if another bank holds the primary mortgage. Banks holding home-equity loans generally can only seize the collateral &#8212; a house &#8212; after the mortgage is paid off.<br />When another bank holds the mortgage and the mortgage payments are current, the home-equity lender is effectively powerless to collect the debt.<br />But here&#8217;s the best part:<br />Unfortunately for home-equity lenders, many borrowers understand that pecking order, concluding there are few repercussions if they stop making payments on their home-equity loan. &#8220;Lenders are seeing people go delinquent on home equity who by all rights wouldn&#8217;t be expected to go delinquent,&#8221; said Dan Balkin of Wholesale Access, a Maryland research and consulting firm that specializes in the mortgage industry.<br />Lesson to would-be homeowners. Keep your mortgage lenders and home equity lenders separate! Lesson to banking industry: maybe all this slicing and dicing of real estate finance into separate bits wasn&#8217;t so smart.<br />(Meta-econo-blogging note. Sometimes, after skimming the Wall Street Journal and The Financial Times, I turn to the econoblogosphere to see what I missed. Sometimes, as was the case this morning, I find that the econobloggers are all highlighting the same story that caught my eye. <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/03/latest-bank-hea.html" target="_blank">The Big Picture</a> and <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/03/wsj-on-souring-home-equity-loans.html" target="_blank" el="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/03/wsj-on-souring-home-equity-loans.html">Calculated Risk</a> also chime in.)</p>
