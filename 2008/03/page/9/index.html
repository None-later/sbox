                                <p>If John McCain is listening to <a href="http://kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/2008/03/time-for-some-treasury-dollar-defense.html">Lawrence Kudlow</a> on economics, he is seriously unqualified to be the next President:</p>
<blockquote><p>This would also be a great time for Sen. McCain, who is traveling overseas, to talk about a strong dollar — both for financial reasons and to promote American prestige. It would underscore that the U.S., despite its temporary economic slowdown, is not weak in any way. The Fed helped the dollar and hurt commodities by its “less is more” policy decision Tuesday, where they cut the fed funds rate by 75 basis points instead of 100. They also devoted more attention to the inflation threat in their policy statement. Meanwhile, two Reserve Bank presidents — Dick Fisher in Dallas and Charlie Plosser in Philadelphia — dissented from the 75 basis point cut due to their concerns over inflation.</p></blockquote>
<p>A stronger dollar would mean less exports and more imports.  If the policy tool used to generate a stronger dollar is a tighter monetary policy, we’ll see less business and residential investment.  Maybe Lawrence Kudlow is just to stupid to realize he is advocating making what may be an emerging recession worse, but let’s hope policy makers are not stupid enough to listen to this clown.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/23/opinion/23berman.html?_r=1&#038;th&#038;emc=th&#038;oref=slogin">Paul Berman</a> in an op-ed in the NYT decribes anothe perspective on radical, modern Islamic extremists.</p>
<blockquote><p>I tried to show that radical Islamism is a modern philosophy, not just a heap of medieval prejudices. In its sundry versions, it draws on local and religious roots, just as it claims to do. But it also draws on totalitarian inspirations from 20th-century Europe. I wanted my readers to understand that with its double roots, religious and modern, perversely intertwined, radical Islamism wields a lot more power, intellectually speaking, than naïve observers might suppose.<br />I declared myself happy in principle with the notion of overthrowing Saddam Hussein, just as I was happy to see the Taliban chased from power. But I wanted everyone to understand that military action, by itself, could never defeat an ideology like radical Islamism — could never contribute more than 10 percent (I invented this statistic, as an illustrative figure) to a larger solution. I hammered away on that point in the days before the war. And today I have to acknowledge that, for all my hammering, radical Islamism, in several of its resilient branches, the ultra-radical and the beyond-ultra-radical, has proved to be stronger even than I suggested.<br />A lot of people right now make the common-sense supposition that if extremist ideologies have lately entered a sort of grisly golden age, the Bush administration’s all-too-predictable blundering in Iraq must bear the blame. Yes, certainly; but that can’t be the only explanation.<br />Extremist movements have been growing bigger and wilder for more than three decades now, during that period, America has tried pretty much everything from a policy point of view. Our presidents have been satanic (Richard Nixon), angelic (Jimmy Carter), a sleepy idiot savant (Ronald Reagan), a cagey realist (George H. W. Bush), wonderfully charming (Bill Clinton) and famously otherwise (George W. Bush). And each president’s Middle Eastern policy has conformed to his character.<br />In regard to Saddam Hussein alone, our government has lent him support (Mr. Reagan), conducted a limited war against him (the first President Bush), inflicted sanctions and bombings (Mr. Clinton, in other than his charming mode), and crudely overthrown him. Every one of those policies has left the Iraqi people worse off than before, even if nowadays, from beneath the rubble, the devastated survivors can at least ruminate about a better future — though I doubt that many of them are in any mood to do so.<br />&#8230;&#8230;.<br />But that was then. In today’s Middle East, the various radical Islamists, basking in their success, paint their liberal rivals and opponents as traitors to Muslim civilization, stooges of crusader or Zionist aggression. And, weirdly enough, all too many intellectuals in the Western countries have lately assented to those preposterous accusations, in a sanitized version suitable for Western consumption.<br />Even in the Western countries, quite a few Muslim liberals, the outspoken ones, live today under a threat of assassination, not to mention a reality of character assassination. Ayaan Hirsi Ali, the Somali-Dutch legislator and writer, is merely an exceptionally valiant example. But instead of enjoying the unstinting support of their non-Muslim colleagues, the Muslim liberals find themselves routinely berated in the highbrow magazines and the universities as deracinated nonentities, alienated from the Muslim world. Or they find themselves pilloried as stooges of the neoconservative conspiracy — quite as if any writer from a Muslim background who fails to adhere to at least a few anti-imperialist or anti-Zionist tenets of the Islamist doctrine must be incapable of thinking his or her own thoughts.<br />A dismaying development. One more sign of the power of the extremist ideologies — one more surprising turn of events, on top of all the other dreadful and gut-wrenching surprises.</p></blockquote>
<p>I can argue with several points made by Paul Berman in perhaps detail, but he offers a powerful point of view in general.  How does one make policy starting with this view?</p>

<blockquote><p>The NYT tells us that President Bush and Treasury Secretary Paulson are philosophically opposed to such restrictions, so presumably there must be someone who philosophically favors them, although the article does not identify anyone in this category. As a general rule, it is probably reasonable to assume that most people are philosophically opposed to regulations that they perceive to be harmful to the economy. The differences arise over which measures they perceive, or claim to perceive, as being harmful.</p></blockquote>
<p>The context?</p>
<blockquote><p>As Congress and the Bush administration struggle to contain the housing and credit crises — and prevent more Wall Street firms from collapsing as Bear Stearns did — a split is forming over how to strengthen oversight of financial institutions after decades of deregulation &#8230; One central battle is likely to be over tightening supervision of the risk-management practices of Wall Street investment banks and perhaps requiring them to keep higher cash reserves as a cushion against unexpected trading losses.  The Democratic proposals would subject Wall Street firms to the kind of strict oversight that banks have had for decades &#8230; “You do it right, and it’s pro-market,” Mr. Frank said in an interview. “Right now, we have an investors’ strike going on, and restoring investor confidence is a top priority.” But industry groups warn that heavy-handed regulation could dry up investment capital just when the economy needs it most … But both President Bush and Mr. Paulson, a former chief executive of Goldman Sachs, remain philosophically opposed to restrictions and requirements that might hamper economic activity.</p></blockquote>
<p>Congressmen Frank argues that we should step back from the laissez faire drive with respect to financial markets while the White House seems to be in favor of less regulation.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/opinion/21krugman.html?_r=1&#038;ex=1363838400&#038;en=9451d3ac8a5a685d&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss&#038;pagewanted=all&#038;oref=slogin">Paul Krugman</a> argues in the New York Times that less regulation is not necessarily pro-growth:</p>
<blockquote><p>Contrary to popular belief, the stock market crash of 1929 wasn’t the defining moment of the Great Depression. What turned an ordinary recession into a civilization-threatening slump was the wave of bank runs that swept across America in 1930 and 1931. This banking crisis of the 1930s showed that unregulated, unsupervised financial markets can all too easily suffer catastrophic failure. As the decades passed, however, that lesson was forgotten — and now we’re relearning it, the hard way. To grasp the problem, you need to understand what banks do. Banks exist because they help reconcile the conflicting desires of savers and borrowers. Savers want freedom — access to their money on short notice. Borrowers want commitment: they don’t want to risk facing sudden demands for repayment. Banks exist because they help reconcile the conflicting desires of savers and borrowers. Savers want freedom — access to their money on short notice. Borrowers want commitment: they don’t want to risk facing sudden demands for repayment.  Normally, banks satisfy both desires: depositors have access to their funds whenever they want, yet most of the money placed in a bank’s care is used to make long-term loans. The reason this works is that withdrawals are usually more or less matched by new deposits, so that a bank only needs a modest cash reserve to make good on its promises. But sometimes — often based on nothing more than a rumor — banks face runs, in which many people try to withdraw their money at the same time. And a bank that faces a run by depositors, lacking the cash to meet their demands, may go bust even if the rumor was false. Worse yet, bank runs can be contagious. If depositors at one bank lose their money, depositors at other banks are likely to get nervous, too, setting off a chain reaction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paul is arguing that we have forgotten the lessons learned in the aftermath of the Great Depression.  This happens to be a case where the reporters of a certain newspaper should be looking over at its oped pages for a little reminder of what the economic issue really is.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/03/2008-1929.html">Greg Mankiw</a> seems to have an issue with what Paul wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>Let me remind everyone of one important difference: Deflation was a large part of the story of the 1930s, and that does not seem like a significant risk today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Greg then goes onto to discuss the debt deflation hypothesis beginning with:</p>
<blockquote><p>From 1929 to 1933 the price level fell 25 percent. Many economists blame this deflation for the severity of the Great Depression. They argue that the deflation may have turned what in 1931 was a typical economic downturn into an unprecedented period of high unemployment and depressed income. If correct, this argument gives new life to the money hypothesis. Because the falling money supply was, plausibly, responsible for the falling price level, it could have been responsible for the severity of the Depression. To evaluate this argument, we must discuss how changes in the price level affect income in the IS LM model.</p></blockquote>
<p>I’m glad the Greg reminds us of this hypothesis given the tendency of some FDR critics to argue as if falling prices had only stabilizing effects.  But falling prices are not an exogenous event in this ISLM model.  In other words, some other event had to initiate the fall in aggregate demand that led to falling prices.  The falling prices may have exacerbated the fall in real income but they did not cause it. </p>
<p>Finding “parallels between the current financial turmoil and what happened during the Great Depression” as Paul did does not mean that one is predicting another Great Depression.</p>

                                <p>When discussing real income growth one of the points often made by conservatives and libertarians is that the average data on real income is irrelevantly  because it does not measure the same people over time.  There is some validity to this point. For example, an individual captured in the snapshot of income data in 1970 who is only 20 years old will be 55 in a snapshot of income in 2005.  Because income tends to increase over time they make the argument that the average income data understates the income gains people actually experience.</p>
<p>The type of data behind this argument is this data on median earnings of full time employees.</p>

<p>It shows, for example that a 50 year old&#8217;s earnings are 121.6% of the average and/or 184.3% or a 20 year old&#8217;s earnings.</p>
<p>Of course if you have a normal pyramid shaped age structure the snapshot of average income in 1970, 1980&#8230;.2000 will include the same share of 20,30&#8230;60 year olds at each time so the argument advanced that the people change is invalid.  But over the last 30-40 years the US has experienced a very unusual demographic shift in the labor force because of the baby boomers maturing.  As the chart shows the composition of employment has changed drastically.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R-VjeSmoYXI/AAAAAAAAAKU/KxIr92pi_EA/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R-VjeSmoYXI/AAAAAAAAAKU/KxIr92pi_EA/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />But the combination of a changing income age structure and income increasing as the labor force<br />ages generates a significant impact on average wage growth.  If you take the income structure shown in the table and apply it to the changing demographic it generates significant results.<br />In the 1970s because of the baby boomers entering the labor force the age of employees and the real median weekly earnings of the US employees would have actually have fallen some 2%.<br />From the bottom in 1980 these factors alone should have generated about a five percentage point increase in real medium weekly earnings&#8211;from 98 to 103.3 in the chart.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R-VlmSmoYYI/AAAAAAAAAKc/qX6ncpttHyE/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R-VlmSmoYYI/AAAAAAAAAKc/qX6ncpttHyE/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The actual increase in real weekly median earnings from 1980 to 2007 was about eight percentage points &#8212; from 98 to 106.2 in the chart.</p>
<p>So when you actually look at the data behind the claim that average real income comparisons over time are invalid you get some very interesting results.  It shows that 64% of the actual increase in real income from 1980 to 2007 was due to the maturing of the labor force rather then other general economic factors such as productivity growth.  So rather than productivity, etc. generating an eight percentage point real income increase from 1980 to 2007 it was only three percentage points.</p>
<p>Of course this is just the opposite point the conservative and libertarians intent to make, but<br />why should we try to confuse them with the facts.</p>

                                <p>Tanta at <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">Calculated Risk</a> has a superb analysis of a recent mortgage <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/21/AR2008032103512_4.html?hpid=topnews&#038;sid=ST2008032103607">sob</a> story.</p>
<p>The Washington Post reporter fails to look closely at what may in fact be happening. The sob story may not be an example of predatory lending but of predatory selling.</p>
<p>Tanta&#8217;s read of this article is close and to the point.</p>
<p>What interests me is how easily readers are gulled into not asking the questions she asks.</p>
<p>How does this happen? Too often we are taken in by style and structure. Let me explain.</p>
<p>First, consider the lead to the story: &#8220;Latina&#8217;s Loss in Va. Epitomizes Mortgage Crises.&#8221; &#8220;<i>Epitomizes</i>&#8221; sets the frame and structure for the story. As readers, we are now ready to make this story typical of predatory lending. The rest of the structure tries to support this reading.</p>
<p>But, as Tanta observes, important details are missing: Who is the seller, for example?<br />Only a discerning reader will ask this question. The rest of us will forget to ask it because we have expected the story to &#8220;epitomize&#8221; predatory lending.</p>
<p>Second, consider the style, especially the rhetorical elements in the piece. There is the appeal to authority: &#8220;Center for Responsible Lending,&#8221; among others.</p>
<p>More importantly, there is appeal to sympathy, a device that often cuts two ways. Ortiz is Latino, with a dream of owning a home; perhaps her English is not as good as it should be; she trusts others. She is the underdog, a simple cook with a dream&#8230;a Latino&#8230;, all appeals to our sympathy.</p>
<p>This rhetorical device will cut two ways, often separating those on the left from those on the right. Liberals will, of course, be outraged and sob at her plight; hard-nosed conservatives will cite &#8220;buyer beware.&#8221;   Then they will argue.</p>
<p>Both, of course, are taking the wrong path to real understanding. Both, ironically, emotionally react when each should be asking probing questions.  Many commentators and readers with large or small hearts have difficulty going beyond this rhetorical device.</p>
<p>Where does all this leave us?</p>
<p>Reading is difficult work. Too often we are easily misled. We think style is content. In a sense it is, if you know how to read. By that I mean, a close reader will see when a writer is substituting style for content. Check, for example, if the writer uses emotionally charged vocabulary to make his point.  Ignore it. Don&#8217;t react to it.</p>
<p>Writing is difficult work as well. Too often, as writers, we use style as a substitute for clear thinking. Each writer has his favorite rhetorical or syntactic devices. I have mine. We have to be careful that they reveal, not camouflage, not substitute for sloppy thinking.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/columnists/forbes/2008/0407/015.html">Here</a> is &#8220;How to End the Panic&#8221; according to Steve Forbes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Treasury Department could buy dollars in the currency exchange markets. Our allies would gladly cooperate with such an operation; their exports are being hurt more and more. The Fed could mop up some of the excess liquidity it has created since 2004, even as it makes targeted loans to beleaguered banks and financial houses.</p>
<p>The other measure: The Treasury Department and the Fed should get together with the SEC, the Comptroller of the Currency and other bank regulators and announce that financial institutions for the next 12 months will no longer write down the value of exotic financial instruments (primarily packages of subprime mortgages). Instead, writedowns will occur only when there have been actual losses on those assets. If a mortgage defaults, a bank will then&#8211;and only then&#8211;recognize the loss.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s preposterous to try to guess what these new instruments are worth in a time of panic. Such assets are being marked down to increasingly arbitrary low levels. But when a bank books such a loss, it must replenish depleted capital, even though cash flows for most financial firms are still positive. Worse, when forced by panicky regulators and lawsuit-fearing accountants to write down the value of these securities, institutions will dump assets in a market where there are temporarily few or no buyers. The result is a spiraling disaster. So let&#8217;s have a time-out on markdowns until we actually have real experience in what kind of losses are actually going to occur.</p>
<p>These two steps would quickly end the panic. Until that happens, expect more trouble.</p></blockquote>
<p>So let me get this straight&#8230;  some investment bank has a pile of opaque derivatives which in turn are based on a bunch of mortgages of unseemly provenance for homes that have collapsed in value.  When the bank bought those derivatives, it booked the earnings it expected to get from those derivatives&#8230; for the next few years.  Enron-style.  The one thing that just about everyone (Mr. Forbes seems to be an exception) has learned in the past couple of months is that a lot of those anticipated revenues aren&#8217;t going to come in.  His suggestion, in plain English, is this:  that banks be legally prevented from locating and correcting errors or even outright fraud on their books.   In other words, while the charade may have been created by a few bad actors, going forward Mr. Forbes believes everyone should play along.  And he also believes that as long as we all close our eyes, clap our hands and pretend, everything will be alright.</p>

                                                                            <a href="./../../../category/bear-stearns/index.html" class="post-category-2270" title="Bear Stearns"><div class="color-box"></div>Bear Stearns</a>                                                                     </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>There seems to be a reluctance among many people to accept that the whole Bear Stearns thing constitutes a bailout. Let me try an analogy&#8230;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say The Cactus Corp. sells squirrel carcasses as fillet mignon.  After a few years, The Cactus Corp. is a strong business with a market cap of $150 million.  Eventually, a few of the customers realize that fillet mignon purchased from The Cactus Corp. tastes very, very different than fillet mignon purchased (at much greater expense) from a reputable grocer.  After a few months, there are no buyers for The Cactus Corp.&#8217;s products.</p>
<p>Now, you may be thinking:  The Cactus Corp. is worth nothing.  But you&#8217;d be wrong.  See, The Cactus Corp., like any other company, is going to have a big inventory&#8230; and health code regulations don&#8217;t just allow it to chuck its inventory onto the street. Worse, it has forward contracts to purchase as many more squirrel carcasses as folks who troll the highways can provide for the next few years.  Which means that The Cactus Corp. is not worth nothing &#8211; its value is negative.</p>
<p>Now, the gubmint decides that guaranteeing a safe supply of food is important, and that The Cactus Corp. is an important part of that process.  So they make the following offer to the guy down the street:  &#8220;We know that The Cactus Corp. has negative value.  But, if you buy out The Cactus Corp. for $2 million, you might still find some use for all those squirrel carcasses and make money.  People do eat squirrel meat, after all, and you&#8217;re getting it very cheap.  But we&#8217;ll also sweeten the pot &#8211; if you don&#8217;t make money, we&#8217;ll make up whatever losses you might have.&#8221;</p>
<p>When that happens, shareholders, officers, and employees of The Cactus Corp. will complain because they&#8217;re getting $2 million for an entity that not long ago was valued at $150 million.  They&#8217;ll insist this was no bailout.  But the fact that company no longer has any positive value whatsoever means that the $2 million is not just a bailout, its a gift.  And its a gift to both those associated with The Cactus Corp. and to the guy down the street.  And its a gift paid for by the tax payer.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The FBI was deeply <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/21/nyregion/21justice.html?pagewanted=1&#038;_r=1&#038;hp">involved</a> in the Spitzer case: Tailing him, eavesdropping on his phone, and examining his bank records. The FBI does not routinely pursue a prostitution case except if it involves minors or slavery.</p>
<p>Neither is the case here.<br />
<blockquote>The scale and intensity of the investigation of Mr. Spitzer, then the governor of New York, seemed on its face to be a departure for the Justice Department, which aggressively investigates allegations of wrongdoing by public officials, but almost never investigates people who pay prostitutes for sex. </p></blockquote>
<p>If it did, then half of Washington would be running for cover. The FBI has not investigated any of the recent political sex scandals.<br />
<blockquote>A review of recent federal cases shows that federal prosecutors go sparingly after owners and operators of prostitution enterprises, and usually only when millions of dollars are involved or there are aggravating circumstances, like human trafficking or child exploitation.</p></blockquote>
<p>Millions of dollars? human trafficking? Child exploitation? Nothing like that here.<br />
<blockquote>Bradley D. Simon, a veteran Justice Department trial lawyer who was federal prosecutor in Brooklyn throughout the 1990s, said that although it was rare for the department to use so many resources on the workings of a prostitution ring, the involvement of such a high-level politician must change the equation. </p></blockquote>
<p>Presently, Mr. Simons represents corporations and individuals in &#8220;the areas of white collar criminal defense, complex civil litigation and corporate compliance&#8230;In his criminal defense practice, Mr. Simon regularly represents clients under investigation for securities, mail, wire, and bank fraud, tax evasion, health care fraud, political corruption, racketeering &#8230;.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>Stakeouts and surveillance are labor-intensive and often involve teams of a dozen or more agents and non-agent specialists. </p></blockquote>
<p>An <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/nyregion/20080310spitzer-complaint.pdf">affidavit </a><br />
<blockquote>filed in the prostitution case did not identify Mr. Spitzer by name, only as Client 9, but it provided far more detail, some of it unusually explicit, about Client 9’s encounter with the prostitute than about any of the nine other clients identified by number in the document. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>If the government gets a Suspicious Activity Report about a high-ranking public official, they would be negligent not to pursue it, if only to determine whether there was bribery or extortion involved,” said Robert D. Luskin, a defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor. Mr. Luskin said that as the case proceeds, the more difficult questions could well involve how the information about Mr. Spitzer became public and whether the government “will prosecute Spitzer if it doesn’t prosecute others in the same situation.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Interesting question. We already know how it became public&#8211;those banks (North Fork Bank, a subsidiary of Capital One, and HSBC Bank USA)&#8211;that Spitzer was investigating for predatory loans. They are in the business of being good citizens.</p>
<p>But what exactly will the FBI prosecute him for? Being a John? Crossing state lines? Hiding money? Looking over the complaint, I found Client 9&#8217;s sums very modest.</p>
<p>The unraveling of the Emperor&#8217;s Club occurred only because of Spitzer. Client 9 is mentioned 57 times, more than twice as many times as any other client.</p>
<p>I am curious. Why have no other individuals stepped forward? Why just Spitzer? How did that happen? Do the other clients know they are mentioned in the complaint? How did Spitzer learn about it?</p>
<p>Frankly, I would like to see the FBI prosecute Spitzer. I want to see the charges: How they arose, who gave them impetus, who decided to proceed, on what basis&#8230;.</p>
<p>Spitzer could do us all a favor in insisting there be charges&#8211;full disclosure of everything. It might be worth it. It is the least he could do for the rest of us. Before he disappears into the woodwork, let&#8217;s have real transparency.</p>
