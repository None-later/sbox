                            <div class="content">
                                <p>As reported by <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080304.RCHINA04/TPStory/Business">The Globe and Mail</a>, on behalf of European and U.S. financial services, Europe and the U.S. have registered a complaint with the WTO that China is &#8220;breaking international trade law.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>The European Union and the United States filed a complaint with the World Trade Organization (WTO) yesterday, concerned that China is trying to freeze out foreign competitors in an effort to build a state monopoly in the $100-million financial information sector</p></blockquote>
<p>China&#8217;s state-owned company, Xinhua, is at the center of the controversy. Financial services such as Bloomberg LP, Reuters LP, and Thomson Corp are required to go through Xinhua, their major competitor, to reach their customers.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Our members are complaining that they can&#8217;t reach their customers in China because they&#8217;re required by regulations to go through Xinhua,&#8221; said Ken Wasch, president of the Software and Information Industry Association. The Washington, D.C., group represents the financial information industry, including, Bloomberg, Dow Jones, and a combined Thomson-Reuters, following the Thomson takeover from last year.<br />&#8220;We want to have direct access to our customers, we don&#8217;t want to have to go through our competitor in order to reach them,&#8221; Mr. Wasch said.</p></blockquote>
<p>Financial services sell data, in real time, to their customers, such as banks and brokerage firms. Their customers then use the data to make financial decisions.<br />While money is certainly at stake, I would differ with the thrust of the article that this complaint differs substantively from China&#8217;s attempt to control the media.<br />Despite what China&#8217;s defenders say, China is a command economy. Whoever controls the flow of information, controls what happens. If Xinhua stays between foreign financial services and their customers, a number of consequences ensue:</p>
<ol>
<li>The flow of information slows.</li>
<li>Xinhua becomes a de facto regulator of financial information. As the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/03/business/3wtofw.php">Herald Tribune</a> points out:<br />
<blockquote>The new regulations make Xinhua both a competitor and regulator to its foreign rivals, requiring that data, videos and photos be funneled through Xinhua-approved distributors. The only currently approved distributor is a Xinhua subsidiary. </p></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In some ways, this controversy is similar to the one surrounding Sovereign Wealth Funds.  Both are extensions of a centralized government. Both create problems concerning transparency. Both can be used to forward a government&#8217;s political agenda. In the market place, both can be used to pick winners or losers.</p>
<p>What we are witnessing is a struggle between two radically different modes of governance, two antithetical types of economies. Those who celebrate globalization as the triumph of the free, democratic market place perhaps should look more closely at precisely the nature of what is happening. Sovereign Wealth Funds&#8211;both in China and the Middle East&#8211;are in ascendance. In both the Middle East and in China, information is tightly controlled in order to advance political or religious agendas.</p>
<p>This latest skirmish, while seemingly just about money, is part of the larger battle that is being waged. Oil and cheap labor have been &#8220;lures.&#8221; Just as the smart fisherman dangles colorful enticements before his unsuspecting prize so too have China and the Middle East lured us with promises of cheap energy and abundant, cheap labor. Now, weaken by our own economic folly and greed, are we ready for the struggle that is to come?</p>

                                <p>We keep hearing from the conservatives-libertarian that we need lower taxes on capital gains and dividends to encourage capital spending or investments.  But when I look at the record of the impact of lower taxes on capital on investment I am hard pressed to see the benefits such lower taxes are suppose to deliver.</p>

<p>Yes, the data is nominal data.  But tax rates work on decisions made on nominal dollars so looking at their impact on nominal dollars is the correct thing to do.</p>

                                <p>We&#8217;ve all heard that the media is biased.  Those who make that argument typically point out (as proof) to the high percentage of reporters are registered Democrats.  I&#8217;d like to argue that the high percentage of reporters that are registered Democrats is not a sign of bias, and might be just the opposite, in fact. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the annual growth in real GDP per capita over the length of each administration beginning with Ike.</p>

<p>(Data from the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S7">NIPA Table 7.1</a>.  Note&#8230;  growth rates calculated from the year before a President took office to his last full year in office.  Thus, for Ike, growth rates were calculated from 1952 to 1960.  Exceptions were made for incomplete terms&#8230; thus growth rates for JFK were calculated from 1960 to 1963, for LBJ from 1963 to 1968, for Nixon from 1968 to 1974, and for Ford from 1974 to 1976.  The data and calculations have been uploaded into <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILh6fYIqgogvcw">Google Docs</a>.) </p>
<p>Now, if you think I&#8217;m cherrypicking, NIPA table 7.1 has data going back to 1929.  Here&#8217;s the same graph extended that far.  (Note&#8230; because the folks who argue media has a liberal bias also like to say that the economy only recovered from the Great Depression as a result of WW2, I&#8217;ve broken FDR&#8217;s term into two:  FDR 1  is the term from 1933 to 1940, and FDR 2 is the term from 1941 to 1945.)</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s say these weren&#8217;t graphs showing the annualized real GDP per capita growth rates over the length of each President.  Let&#8217;s tell a different story.  When cancer patients are treated with chemotherapy, it kills off production of their white blood cells, and because these cells are used to fight off infection, chemotherapy drains patients and makes them more likely to get infections.  Now, say there are two schools of thought for how to deal with this problem, the &#8220;red&#8221; school of thought and the &#8220;blue&#8221; school of thought.  If the graphs above showed the average change in the number of white blood cells of patients who had undergone either the red or blue program, would your first assumption, on looking at those graphs be:  &#8220;gee, any reporter who specializes in medical issues who gets cancer and asks his doctor to put him through the blue program must be biased&#8221;?   Sure, there could be mitigating circumstances, but unless there was some funny business with how the tests were designed or conducted or the data was collected in some odd way, most of us would be more likely to assume if there was something wrong, it would be among those reporters who developed cancer and nevertheless requested the red program to supplement their chemotherapy.</p>
<p>My point&#8230;  maybe most reporters are not familiar with the numbers.  They haven&#8217;t seen these graphs.  But they are still somewhat close to the action.  And they&#8217;re better educated about what is going on than the average person.  Perhaps if there are more of them that are registered Democrats than registered Republicans, there is a good reason for it.</p>

                                <p>I don&#8217;t have strong feelings about the Democratic race.  I voted for Hillary in the Dem  primary, but frankly, I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;s half the man her husband was, so to speak, when he ran for office.  (I have zero problems with a female President &#8211; I just think that it would be nice to have a decent female candidate, just like it would be nice to have a decent male candidate.)  As to Obama, he sounds very inspirational, and that counts for a lot, but like Reagan, I&#8217;m not sure he&#8217;s going to inspire us necessarily in useful directions.  (Not that he&#8217;ll repeat Reagan&#8217;s positions, but there is error on the right and there is error on the left.)  My guess at this time&#8230; a President Obama would perform about average on some things, just like Reagan, but 20 years later there&#8217;d be the same hagiography about him from folks on the left as there is from folks on the right.  As to the Reps, I think McCain is simply nuts.  And I&#8217;m not very pleased with his willingness to kiss up to the same people who demonized him very unfairly during the run for the Republican nomination in 2000.  It shows a lack of self-respect, and a willingness to do anything.  (I&#8217;m actually surprised those same folks are OK with him too.)</p>
<p>Anyway, here is a post, a few days old, by Josh Whalen suggesting that if Obama is the nominee, he should <a href="http://www.panix.com/~joshua/blog/2008/03/01.html">pick Liz Holtzman</a> as VP.</p>
<p>My first reaction, to be honest, was &#8220;who?&#8221;  Holtzman is a New Yorker, the youngest woman ever elected to the House of Representatives (in 1972), and was well-known as a crime fighter.  Real Whalen&#8217;s post for the pro-argument.  What do you think about it?  And who do you think Obama should pick if he&#8217;s the nominee?  Ditto Hillary?  And McCain?</p>

                                <p>This Administration has turned large unified surpluses (real small general fund deficits) into unified deficits (real large general fund deficits) in part because of their tax “shifts” (called cuts but really deferrals) and in part because Federal spending has increased faster than GDP.  John McCain and other Republicans will blame domestic spending but <a href="http://www.cbpp.org/3-5-08bud.htm">Richard Kogan</a> carefully documents why any such claim is not true:</p>
<blockquote><p>Both last year and this year, President Bush called for large funding increases for defense and related programs while demanding considerable restraint in domestic appropriations.  And this year, like last year, he has threatened to veto appropriations bills if Congress does not adhere to his tight domestic levels.  Some may think the President’s recent attempts to squeeze domestic appropriations are being made in response to an explosion of domestic discretionary funding during his Administration’s first six years.  But this is not correct: there has been no such funding explosion for domestic discretionary programs.  Between fiscal year 2001 (the last year for which appropriations levels were set under President Clinton) and fiscal year 2008, funding for domestic discretionary programs has been more constrained than any other area of the budget and has shrunk both as a share of the budget and as a share of the economy.  In contrast, appropriations for defense and other security-related programs have increased more rapidly than any other area of the budget — even more rapidly than the costs of the “big three” entitlement programs: Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.</p></blockquote>
<p>Table 2 is of particular interest as it shows the average annual increase of various subcategories of program costs not only in nominal terms but also in real terms as well as real spending per capita.  Domestic discretionary spending – which is the favorite whipping boy of the GDP – has grown by only 0.3% per year in real per capita terms.  Defense and security, which is the favorite cash cow of the GOP – has grown by 8.1% per year in real per capita terms. The former’s share of total program cost has declined from 18.4% to 14.7% while the latter’s share has increased from 21.7% to 29.2%.  Anyone that is calling for more wars and more defense spending cannot be taken seriously as a fiscal conservative.</p>

                                <p>We went to bed last night knowing the GOP nominee would be John McCain. We woke up this morning (or maybe some of you will be waking up a little later) to see that Senator Clinton won Ohio, Texas, and Rhode Island at least temporarily ending Senator Obama’s momentum with his win in Vermont.  There is a lot of spin from both camps and there’ll be all sorts of analysis but <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/181524.php">this post</a> Josh Marshall is as good as it gets.  </p>
<p>Josh makes many points including the fact that Clinton’s net gain in pledge delegates was quite small and Obama will likely go into the convention with a small lead.  So what’s his take on those superdelegates?</p>
<blockquote><p>The super delegates are going to break for the winner of the primary/caucus process, as long as it&#8217;s relatively clear. Who the &#8216;winner&#8217; (in the perception of the supers and Democrats around the country) is will also be heavily informed by what the available evidence suggests about who&#8217;s going to be the stronger candidate in the general … At the end of the day, the winner of the pledged delegate race has the strongest claim to the nomination. Everything else is spin. But it&#8217;s a strong claim, not incontestable &#8230; if neither candidate has it locked by the convention, the super delegates will want to pick the candidate who looks like the general election winner and is the favorite of Democrats at the time of the convention</p></blockquote>
<p>Josh notes that Obama is still likely to be our nominee but he has to show that he needs to show he can stand up to the kind of assault that Team Clinton levied against him.  While they were rough, we also know that the GOP is currently plotting a much more nasty assault.   We still have a real fight for the nomination over the next few weeks.  I just hope that both sides figure out how to wage this thing in an effective way that does not give the GOP slime machine more ammunition.</p>

                                <blockquote><p>NEW YORK, Feb. 7 /PRNewswire/ &#8212; The Securities Law Firm of Klayman &#038; Toskes, P.A. (&#8220;K&#038;T&#8221;)(http://www.nasd-law.com) announced today that it continues to investigate sales of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) from Merrill Lynch (NYSE: MER) and UBS (NYSE: UBS) to institutional investors. These firms sold billions of dollars in CDOs to investors around the world. Some of the CDOs which sustained heavy losses include Norma CDO I, Centre Square CDO, South Coast Funding V CDO, Mezzanine ABS CDO, and the Tabs CDO.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, federal prosecutors and the SEC stated that they were looking into whether Wall Street brokerage firms, like Merrill Lynch and UBS, &#8220;deliberately misvalued, or &#8216;mismarked,&#8217; massive holdings of mortgage securities.&#8221; Further, the U.S. Justice Department is looking into whether brokerage firms committed fraud in their &#8220;originating, packaging and selling mortgage-related products.&#8221;</p>
<p>Presently, K&#038;T is investigating how Merrill Lynch and UBS marketed their CDO products, and whether the brokerage firms properly disclosed the risks of the products to its investors. The issue of whether Merrill Lynch and UBS over-stated and inflated the value of their CDO products is rapidly becoming a common theme in the investigation. Further, K&#038;T is looking into whether the CDOs were suitable for the institutions, municipalities, fund of funds, and pension funds that invested in the products through Merrill Lynch and UBS.</p>
<p>K&#038;T has already filed numerous arbitration claims on behalf of investors who lost millions in the CDO market. If you are an investor in CDOs that were packaged and/or underwritten by Merrill Lynch and UBS, or if you have information relevant to our investigation, please contact Lawrence L. Klayman, Esquire or Steven D. Toskes, Esquire of Klayman &#038; Toskes, P.A., at 888-997- 9956. You may also visit us on the web at http://www.nasd-law.com.</p>
<p>Klayman &#038; Toskes, P.A., an experienced and nationally recognized securities litigation law firm, continues its representation of investors throughout the world in securities arbitration and litigation matters against major Wall Street brokerage firms.</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/marketsmag/mm_1007_story2.html">Bloomberg Magazine, in &#8220;Unsafe Havens&#8221;</a>. (Hat tip to <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2007/09/some-money-market-funds-have-large.html">Naked Capitalism</a>.)</p>
<blockquote><p>reports that money market funds run by Bank of America Corp., Credit Suisse Group, Fidelity Investments and Morgan Stanley owned over $6 billion of CDOs with subprime debt in June.</p>
<p>The reason this is a serious issue is that money market funds have a $1 NAV, meaning &#8220;net asset value&#8221; rule. The funds are required by the SEC to invest conservatively. In practice, they always to maintain principal value. But as the article explains, this sort of investment puts the funds at risk of breaching the $1 NAV requirement.</p>
<p>What this article tells us, in effect, is that investors weren&#8217;t completely nuts to have dumped money market funds for Treasuries in August. Of course, they probably should have called the fund manager first, since most large fund management firms, such as Vanguard, correctly see this sort of paper as in appropriate for a money market fund.</p>
<p>The article is quite long but very much worth reading in its entirety; we&#8217;ve excepted the juicy bits. From Bloomberg Magazine:</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to most investors, some of the largest money market funds today are putting part of their cash into one of the riskiest debt investments in the world: collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime mortgage loans&#8230;.</p>
<p>Money market funds with total assets of $300 billion have invested in subprime debt this year&#8230;.</p>
<p>Under SEC rules, money market managers must invest in securities with &#8220;minimal credit risks.&#8221; Joseph Mason, a finance professor at Drexel University in Philadelphia and a former economist at the U.S. Treasury Department, says subprime debt in money market funds is far from safe.</p>
<p>&#8220;This creates tremendous risk for today&#8217;s money market investors,&#8221; says Mason, who wrote an 84-page report on CDOs this year. &#8220;Right now, I&#8217;m not comfortable investing anything in CDOs.&#8221;&#8230;.</p>
<p>On Aug. 9, BNP Paribas SA, France&#8217;s biggest bank by market value, froze withdrawals on three investment funds with assets of 2 billion euros because the bank couldn&#8217;t find a way to value its U.S. subprime bonds and other assets. CDOs aren&#8217;t bought and sold on exchanges and their trading has little transparency&#8230;.</p>
<p>Bruce Bent, who in 1970 created the first money market fund, The Reserve Fund, says no money market fund should invest in subprime debt.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s inappropriate,&#8221; Bent, 70, says. &#8220;It doesn&#8217;t have a place in money market funds. When I created the first money market fund, I said you have to have immediate liquidity, safety and a reasonable rate of return. You also have to have a situation where you&#8217;re not giving people headline risk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Investors have sought safety during the subprime meltdown by moving their holdings to U.S. Treasuries and money market funds. On Aug. 8, just after the Bear Stearns hedge funds filed for bankruptcy protection, U.S. money market fund total assets reached a record high of $2.66 trillion, with investors pouring $49 billion into such funds in one week, according to the ICI.</p></blockquote>
<p>Reader Jack asked about money disappearing. Some was pure vapor wares in a bidding war for promises on ROI. Other money came from what were safe havens of money markets, municipal bonds, and other financial vehicles that were supposed to be only steady and safe.</p>
<p>Springfield MA sued and won their $14 million from Merryl Lynch based on their agent&#8217;s inappropriate behavior by disregarding the town&#8217;s mandate of investment vehicles.</p>

                                <p>As a resident of Manhattan, I wish to thank those attending the <a href="http://www.heartland.org/NewYork08/newyork08.cfm">International Conference on Climate Change</a> for visiting my city over the past three days.  I hope you enjoyed what this city has to offer as well as the weather.  It had been clear with highs near 50 or more until today with the likely topping 60 but rain seems on the horizon.  I mention this as <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=ZTdiOWE0YWQwMTg4YTlhOThmNDdkNTFmNTg1MjBkZDM=">Thomas Sowell</a> thought you’d be facing this:</p>
<blockquote><p>It has almost become something of a joke when some “global warming” conference has to be cancelled because of a snowstorm or bitterly cold weather.</p></blockquote>
<p>Too bad he did not <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/thomas-sowell-should-not-become-weather.html">check the forecast</a> before he wrote his little rant.</p>
<p>Sowell also predicted that the press would ignore this group of global warming deniers.  <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/03/04/despite-broad-coverage-of-global-warming-deniers-conference-right-wing-slams-media-for-ignoring-it">Ali of Think Progress</a> says this Sowell prediction did not pan out so well either!</p>

<blockquote><p>IF you’ve stood in line at a farmers’ market recently, you know that the local food movement is thriving, to the point that small farmers are having a tough time keeping up with the demand.<br />But consumers who would like to be able to buy local fruits and vegetables not just at farmers’ markets, but also in the produce aisle of their supermarket, will be dismayed to learn that the federal government works deliberately and forcefully to prevent the local food movement from expanding. And the barriers that the United States Department of Agriculture has put in place will be extended when the farm bill that House and Senate negotiators are working on now goes into effect.<br />As a small organic vegetable producer in southern Minnesota, I know this because my efforts to expand production to meet regional demand have been severely hampered by the Agriculture Department’s commodity farm program. As I’ve looked into the politics behind those restrictions, I’ve come to understand that this is precisely the outcome that the program’s backers in California and Florida have in mind: they want to snuff out the local competition before it even gets started.<br />&#8230;<br />Who pays the price for this senselessness? Certainly I do, as a Midwestern vegetable farmer. But anyone trying to do what I do on, say, wheat acreage in the Dakotas, or rice acreage in Arkansas would face the same penalties. Local and regional fruit and vegetable production will languish anywhere that the commodity program has influence.<br />Ultimately of course, it is the consumer who will pay the greatest price for this — whether it is in the form of higher prices I will have to charge to absorb the government’s fines, or in the form of less access to the kind of fresh, local produce that the country is crying out for.<br />Farmers need the choice of what to plant on their farms, and consumers need more farms like mine producing high-quality fresh fruits and vegetables to meet increasing demand from local markets — without the federal government actively discouraging them.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update:</strong>  MG points out I missed this part of the article&#8230;I did in my scanning.  Thanks.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The commodity farm program effectively forbids farmers who usually grow corn or the other four federally subsidized commodity crops (soybeans, rice, wheat and cotton) from trying fruit and vegetables. Because my watermelons and tomatoes had been planted on “corn base” acres, the Farm Service said, my landlords were out of compliance with the commodity program. </p>
<p>I’ve discovered that typically, a farmer who grows the forbidden fruits and vegetables on corn acreage not only has to give up his subsidy for the year on that acreage, he is also penalized the market value of the illicit crop, and runs the risk that those acres will be permanently ineligible for any subsidies in the future. (The penalties apply only to fruits and vegetables — if the farmer decides to grow another commodity crop, or even nothing at all, there’s no problem.)&#8221;</p></blockquote>
