<blockquote><p>Karl Rove, former senior aide to President Bush, spoke to a hostile crowd at the University of Iowa yesterday evening. Students and local citizens protested his appearance at the university and “staged a mock trial” for Rove inside the student union before the speech.</p>
<p>During the lecture, Rove lashed out at hostile questioners, telling one man his comment showed “a simple, stupid mind” and chastised what he said were “stupid statements” from the audience. Rove also said that former Amb. Joseph Wilson “lied” about his 2002 trip to Niger and accused an audience member of “perpetuating libel” on the U.S. military for asking about the real number of deaths in the Iraq war:</p></blockquote>
<p>I know that Karl has not had time to come by this week to Angry Bear to read our comment policy, so he is to be forgiven this time round. (Besides, he received $40,000 to say those things, so maybe he has no incentive. Sigh).</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/03/advisers.html">Greg Mankiw</a> comes a discussion by <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/cnnm/080305/030408_economic_advisers.html">Jeanne Sahadi</a> that Senator Clinton listens to Gene Sperling (no surprise) and Senator Obama listens to Austan Goolsbee. John McCain apparently is listening to deficit hawk Douglas Holtz-Eakin who appears to be more willing to use entitlement cuts than tax increases to restore fiscal sanity.</p>
<p>On this score – I’d prefer those listening to Sperling or Goolsbee but let’s all pray that McCain does not listen to <a href="http://kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/2008/03/more-on-mccain-dollar.html">Lawrence Kudlow</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is one reason why my idea of a McCain dollar could be very important. A stronger greenback would reduce inflation. Cutting corporate taxes, as well as reforming the entire tax code, might also help.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right boys and girls – let’s go with tight money to lower inflation as we adopt fiscal stimulus to get us back to full employment. Sort of what I criticized in the update to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/buiter-argues-that-labor-market-is-too.html">this post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Isn’t this the macroeconomic policy mix during 1981 that gave us a collapse of net exports from an overly strong dollar (something Kudlow endorses) and the 1982 recession? Of course, we could have a massive fiscal stimulus with little in the way of tight money, which might be inflationary if Buiter is even remotely correct about the labor market. Leave it to a clown like Kudlow to endorse such a disastrous policy mix!</p></blockquote>
<p>Correct me if I’m wrong but wasn’t Kudlow one of the village idiots that convinced Reagan to go along with this insane macroeconomic policy mix. While Reagan was an economics major, McCain has admitted that he knows little about economics. So why would a President McCain be more willing to listen to Douglas Holtz-Eakin than to free lunch village idiots like Lawrence Kudlow?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.harrisinteractive.com/harris_poll/index.asp?PID=879">Harris Interactive</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>One always hears about a blog breaking news before the &#8220;mainstream media&#8221; actually covers it. But are people really reading these blogs? The answer is no, as over half of Americans (56%) say they never read blogs that discuss politics. Just under one-quarter (23%) say that they read them several times a year and just 22 percent of Americans read blogs regularly (several times a month or more). These are some of the results of a nationwide Harris Poll of 2,302 U.S. adults surveyed online between January 15 and 22, 2008 by Harris Interactive.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_03/013300.php">Kevin Drum</a> ponders:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe I believe this survey after all. But no. I really don&#8217;t. I mean, 22%? Surely this number has been heavily skewed upward by the fact that this poll was conducted online, right?</p></blockquote>
<p>Right! Selection bias is a distortion of evidence or data that arises from the way that the data are collected. Self-selection bias occurs when the characteristics of the people which cause them to select themselves in the group create situations where a biased estimate of the general population is created. What percent of adults neither respond to online polls nor read political blogs? In other words, what percent of the entire population read political blogs? This survey really does not tell us that. Kevin does point us to <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/archives/2008/03/1in_5_read_blogs_regularly_find_more_accurate_and_valuable_than_mainstream_press">James Joyner</a> who divines from the survey:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, we have a survey showing that 44 percent of Americans read political blogs occasionally and 23 percent read them several times a year. Among those who do, 78 percent find them as accurate or more accurate than the mainstream press and 82 percent find them as valuable or more valuable than the mainstream press. Yet the story is framed as blogs being inaccurate and less widely read than some might think?</p></blockquote>
<p>So maybe the message is that those of us in the minority who actually do read political blogs should tell our friends to join us as they will be more informed than those who trust cable news – especially that station we call Faux News.</p>

<blockquote><p>WASHINGTON Feb. 14, 2008 — Comptroller of the Currency John C. Dugan issued the following statement today, responding to comments from New York Governor Eliot Spitzer:<br />Almost everyone who has paid attention to the subprime lending crisis has concluded that OCC-regulated national banks were not the problem. Instead, the worst abuses came from loans originated by state-licensed mortgage brokers and lenders that are exclusively the responsibility of state regulators.<br />However, comments from today assert that the OCC and national bank preemption have prevented the states from taking action against predatory or abusive lenders. That’s just plain wrong.<br />The OCC extensively regulates the activities of national banks, including mortgage lending. The OCC established strong protections against predatory lending practices years ago, and has applied those standards through examinations of every national bank. As a result, predatory mortgage lenders have avoided national banks like the plague. The abuses consumers have complained about most — such as loan flipping and equity stripping — are not tolerated in the national banking system. And the looser lending practices of the subprime market simply have not gravitated to national banks: They originated just 10% of subprime loans in 2006, when underwriting standards were weakest, and delinquency rates on those loans are well below the national average.<br />Nothing the OCC has done has prevented the states from regulating and preventing abuses among the lenders that they license – lenders that are the source of most of today’s problems. The states have ample authority – as well as clear responsibility – to set standards for these lenders and enforce them. It defies logic to argue that preemption was an impediment. National banks are bound to obey the strict standards enforced by the OCC everywhere they operate – even in states that had far less rigorous standards. The states should have applied equally rigorous standards to the non-bank lenders that were responsible for the bulk of the problems.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Everybody needs a hobby. Long time readers may be aware I feed feral cats. I used to do it every day until I moved&#8230; then I found a nice Israeli lady who took over my route on weekdays, but since she can&#8217;t make it on weekends, I still drive back out there every Saturday and Sunday. I used to have as many as 18, um, customers, scattered in about eight different feeding stations, but construction in the area, plus neutering, have dwindled the numbers down to four cats, who get fed in three different areas.</p>
<p>(The entire area is slated for construction &#8211; an outdoor mini-mall and condos. If/when it happens, I don&#8217;t know what will happen to the remaining cats. There aren&#8217;t places to relocate them and I&#8217;m in position to take in another.)</p>
<p>One of the three feeding stations is in a set of bushes behind a restaurant. This Saturday, the bushes were over-run with rats&#8230; a sign that the resident cat, a handsome black cat, was either dead or (much less likely) had moved on. Sunday, there were no rats. I knew immediately&#8230; another cat had moved in. So I left out a bit of kibble and waited and watched for a bit, and sure enough, a skinny orange cat crept out of the bushes. Later, I left him more kibble and a can &#8211; he clearly needs some meat on those bones. And I guess some time soon I have to make some calls to see if someone who still lives in the area will trap and neuter him.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s my point&#8230; because of the restaurant&#8217;s waste, the entire area could easily be infested with rats. The presence of a single cat eliminates them all very quickly. The cost to the restaurant of making the environment amenable to a feral cat is very, very small.</p>
<p>Here is another <a href="http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/healthday/080221/cats-help-shield-owners-from-heart-attack.htm">story about cats</a> (hat tip <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/03/links-31108.html">Naked Capitalism</a>):</p>
<blockquote><p>Whether it&#8217;s a frisky kitten or a tubby tabby, a cat at home could cut your heart attack risk by almost a third, a new study suggests.</p>
<p>The finding, from a 10-year study of more than 4,300 Americans, suggests that the stress relief pets provide humans is heart-healthy.</p>
<p>And dog lovers shouldn&#8217;t feel left out: Although the study found no such benefit from &#8220;man&#8217;s best friend,&#8221; that&#8217;s probably because there simply weren&#8217;t enough dog owners in the study to draw firm conclusions, the researchers said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For years we have known that psychological stress and anxiety are related to cardiovascular events, particularly heart attacks,&#8221; noted study senior author Dr. Adnan Qureshi, executive director of the Minnesota Stroke Institute at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>According to Qureshi, the new research shows that &#8220;essentially there is a benefit in relieving those inciting factors from pets.&#8221;</p>
<p>He was slated to present the findings Thursday at the American Stroke Association&#8217;s International Stroke Conference in New Orleans.</p>
<p>The stress-cardiovascular disease link is well-documented in scientific literature, and the affection and pleasure pets give humans is a known stress-buster. In fact, one study presented in 2005 at an American Heart Association meeting found that a single 12-minute visit with a dog improved the heart and lung function of people with heart failure.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Cat owners &#8220;appeared to have a lower rate of dying from heart attacks&#8221; over 10 years of follow-up compared to feline-free folk, Qureshi said.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the effect &#8212; a 30 percent reduction in heart attack risk &#8212; &#8220;was a little bit surprising,&#8221; he added. &#8220;We certainly expected an effect, because we thought that there was a biologically plausible mechanism at work. But the magnitude of the effect was hard to predict.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I love a good conspiracy theory as much as the next guy.</p>
<p>I am going to weave you one&#8211;connecting Spitzer&#8217;s recent confession as Client Number 9 in the Emperor&#8217;s Club and his February announcement that the Bush administration through the OCC (Office of the Controller of the Currency) has been complicit in allowing predatory lending practices among national banks and thrifts.</p>
<p>Spitzer <i>was</i> a rising hero in the Democratic Party, obviously scheduled for callings higher than that as governor of New York State. The long and short of this conspiracy theory is: &#8220;They&#8221; got him. Spitzer, like Bill Clinton, has a big weakness: His desire for illicit sex.</p>
<p>Some caveats before I start.
<ul>
<li>Spitzer was caught fair and square. He just had to have his crotch illicitly jollied</li>
<li>Wall Street hated him. We cannot blame them, nor can we deny it its jubilation at his fall. (It did cheer at the news.)</li>
<li>Spitzer had plenty of enemies in New York state. He has been accused, rightfully or wrongly, of unfair prosecutorial practices.</li>
<li>For many, Spitzer was a hero in bringing the likes of Merrill Lynch to heel. (I cheered; I was once a client of ML. I remember asking my ML advisor about the charges. He hemmed and hawed.)</li>
<li>Those who hate Spitzer will certainly connect his prosecutorial practices with his visits to the Emperor&#8217;s Club.</li>
</ul>
<p>Most importantly, while I love conspiracy theories, I do not necessarily believe them. But I thought I would be among the first to trot this one out. Do I believe it? I am not sure.</p>
<p>On February 28, 2008, Spitzer wrote an <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/13/AR2008021302783.html">article</a> in the Washington Post, one that received little attention, yet one that strikes at the heart of the subprime mess that is now threatening each and every one of us.</p>
<blockquote><p>Several years ago, state attorneys general and others involved in consumer protection began to notice a marked increase in a range of predatory lending practices by mortgage lenders. Some were misrepresenting the terms of loans, making loans without regard to consumers&#8217; ability to repay, making loans with deceptive &#8220;teaser&#8221; rates that later ballooned astronomically, packing loans with undisclosed charges and fees, or even paying illegal kickbacks. These and other practices, we noticed, were having a devastating effect on home buyers. In addition, the widespread nature of these practices, if left unchecked, threatened our financial markets.</p>
<p>Predatory lending was widely understood to present a looming national crisis. This threat was so clear that as New York attorney general, I joined with colleagues in the other 49 states in attempting to fill the void left by the federal government. Individually, and together, state attorneys general of both parties brought litigation or entered into settlements with many subprime lenders that were engaged in predatory lending practices. Several state legislatures, including New York&#8217;s, enacted laws aimed at curbing such practices</p>
<p>In 2003, during the height of the predatory lending crisis, the OCC invoked a clause from the 1863 National Bank Act to issue formal opinions preempting all state predatory lending laws, thereby rendering them inoperative. The OCC also promulgated new rules that prevented states from enforcing any of their own consumer protection laws against national banks. The federal government&#8217;s actions were so egregious and so unprecedented that all 50 state attorneys general, and all 50 state banking superintendents, actively fought the new rules</p></blockquote>
<p>The OCC is the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. Charted in 1863, its purpose is to organize and to administer a system of national banks and a uniform currency. Its mission is &#8220;&#8230;to ensure that national banks are safe and sound, competitive and profitable, and capable of serving in the best possible manner the banking needs of its customers.&#8221;</p>
<p>In his 2003 annual report, J. D. Hawke, Jr., then Comptroller of the Currency, <a href="http://www2.blogger.com/www.occ.gov/annrpt/2003%20Annual%20Report.pdf">said:</a></p>
<p>
<blockquote>The OCC defines predatory lending as the aggressive marketing of credit to borrowers who cannot afford it on the terms being offered—typically, on the basis of the liquidation value of the collateral. The OCC issued two advisory letters to national banks, aimed at ensuring that neither they nor their subsidiaries engage in lending that might be considered predatory, and that their lending complies with safety and soundness standards and all applicable consumer protection laws. A number of states sought to impose their own anti-predatory lending laws on national banks in 2003. In response to an appeal by two national banks and after reviewing public comment, the OCC concluded that a Georgia law that imposed severe restrictions on all lenders operating within the state, did not apply to national banks and their subsidiaries. In issuing this preemption determination, the OCC ruled that the Georgia law interfered with national banks’ ability to exercise permissible federal powers and was thus in conflict with federal law.</p></blockquote>
<p>It seems to me that Hawke, Jr. defined predatory practices rather nicely. Yet what has the OCC done? Were they the watch dogs they should have been? What if those at the top were looking only at the profits without regard for the consequences? I have the feeling that the &#8220;buddy system&#8221; is alive and well in Washington. The officers of the OCC wine and dine with the banking and financial crowd.</p>
<p>A storm was brewing. Many state examiners were concerned that predatory lending practices were on the rise. In 2003, the seeds of the now subprime disaster had been planted. Some people were concerned. The OCC was apparently doing nothing. (How well I remember Secretary&#8217;s Paulson&#8217;s comment that we have to be careful not to stifle financial innovation with regulations&#8230;and undue oversight?)</p>
<p>In response to this storm, Julie L. Williams, then Chief Counsel of the OCC, issued the following remarks:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>At the heart of these issues are Constitutional principles of Federal preemption. We are acutely aware that in many quarters the very concept of preemption is unpopular. In some respects, the fact that Federal preemption arises from the federal charter of national banks seems to put us, inescapably, at odds with some state authorities. This is unfortunate, because the OCC and the states do not have fundamentally different goals. </p></blockquote>
<p>At heart was the concept of &#8220;uniform&#8221; administrative system. Because the OCC was charged with organizing and administering a uniform system of banking, the OCC employed &#8220;Federal preemption,&#8221; arguing that any other approach simply led to chaos. In short, the states could not oversee or regulate national banks, regardless their suspicions of predatory or dangerous lending practices. She does have a point. A uniform regulatory system is important. What happened, I suspect, is that the laissez-faire principle was in effect. Money was being made. Friends were happy.</p>
<p>A somewhat similar preemption occurred during the Keating Lincoln Savings and Loan Association <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDE123CF933A25754C0A96F948260">scandal</a> of the 1980/s. This preemption involved the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.</p>
<p>San Francisco examiners suspected that Lincoln was engaged in high risk investments. Keating asked that the examiners be removed in favor of Seattle based examiners. At first the FHLB objected the removal of the San Francisco examiners. Then, oddly enough, by a vote of 2 to 1, it removed them, recommending that &#8220;oversight of Lincoln be handed either to the bank board&#8217;s Washington, D.C., office or to examiners from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Seattle.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keating, apparently, had squealed long and loudly about the San Francisco examiners. His voice was heard.</p>
<p>A year later, that scandal finally broke with the bank board taking &#8220;over Lincoln, with $5.5 billion in assets, saying it posed a threat to the banking system. Losses at the institution, which has vast holdings of undeveloped land in Arizona, are expected to exceed $2 billion. &#8220;</p>
<p>The FHLB&#8217;s handling of the Lincoln case was cause for much Congressional scrutiny. Guess who worked for the FHLB during this time. Yup, Julie L. Williams, soon to be Chief Counsel at the OCC.</p>
<p>So there you have it, a brand new conspiracy theory. Spitzer was the visible leader, spearheading the attempt to hold responsible those who have created what Nouriel Roubini calls a &#8220;financial meltdown.&#8221; His voice was a national voice, not some out-of-the way examiner. Was there an attempt to find the messenger&#8217;s weakness, to sully him so that his message would not be heard?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, rest assured, the media will deluge us with soiled panties and other sexual sundries. The Roman circus has been ramped up. Nothing in this country sells quite so much as sex and sexual scandals. We just cannot help peering into our neighbors windows to see how they &#8220;do it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yup, &#8220;they&#8221; got him, and &#8220;they&#8221; got him in a way that will tease and delight us all.</p>

<blockquote>Andrew Samwick at <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2008/03/what-unemployment-rate-misses.html">VoxBaby</a> posted on unemployment rate &#8220;What the unemployment rate misses? &#8220;. This post obtained a relatively high visibility and was commented on by <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/voxbaby-unemployment-figures.html">Angry Bear</a> and <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/03/the-misleading.html">Big Picture</a>. I think that this approach is slightly biased and misleading . What we really need (to consider)is the driving force behind unemployment, not its measured level. Any current measure is far enough from some true one, if the latter does exist. In this blog, we devote enough time to modeling and prediction of unemployment in the USA and other developed countries. This is the reason to comment on the aforementioned posts and revisit our position to strenghten it with some new examples. Figures 2 and 3 do elaborate on the link between unemployment and the change rate of labor force using monthly estimates for both variables.</p>
<p>The figure presented by Vox Baby is a good illustration of the political thinking behind the post. Some people just want the unemployment level to be as large as possible. At first glance, all curves in the figure look similar. In that sense, having one of the definitions of unemployment is enouth to obtain all others &#8211; these definitions just represent different, but fixed, portions of some &#8220;true&#8221; unemployment. Theoretically, one can use any definition for economic study since they are equivalent.</p>
<p>Figure 1 compares unemployment rate and the ratio of the number of part time workers (for economic reasons) and the number of unemployed according to the BLS definition.</p>
<p>Politically, in the year of elections, Democrats like the upper extreme, and Republicans &#8211; the smallest possible value. If Dems will win, one could expect the next election will bring opposite situation in unemployment definition used.(Lightly edited for this post)</p></blockquote>

<p>On another blog it was mentioned that liberal blogs never posted videos made by terrorists that showed beheadings, dismemberments, and other atrocities. Which as far as I can tell is true. They are mostly on &#8220;milblogs&#8221;.</p>
<p>My one response was that our President has ordered that no pictures of American military be shown even coming home in flag draped coffins, much less injured. By implication I was arguing that this war is extremely antiseptic on all fronts in regard to public participation of the pain involved, and such appears to be at least familiar if not a comfortable position to maintain.</p>
<p>The fact that Angry Bear does not carry the terrorist videos because it is liberal makes no sense to me. I would think Bruno would have some thoughts on this issue as well for his station. I was wondering if he played terrorist sound tracks periodically to his conservative audience, and if not why not. It is not a fair question for him nor directed at him, but merely an idol, speculative, and throw away sort of thought in passing for him and myself for AB.</p>
<p>I know that two journalist names, Mike Totten and Dahr Jamail, seem to create a stir of passion from different people by what they report.</p>
<p>I personally am familiar with certain kinds of blood and guts, not war involved. If war is to be fought, I would expect all of us to acknowledge blood and guts. Instead it is marginalized as too &#8216;political&#8217;. Or numbers are too political. Or child deaths from diarrhea are not war related in Bahgdad (I like kids).</p>
<p>(Yet simultaneous to the war we have the sensibility of shielding people from real pictures, preferring movies and cartoons instead)</p>
<p>So when I chat with some servicemen as well, or Tx1, it makes the conversation surreal at times, especially from my particular point of view with blood up to the elbows in a figurative way, second hand, as a conscientious objector and listener. Being up to acknowledging death and injury is not our perception of men of peace or war, is it?</p>
