                                <p>Here are some charts to demonstrate what I was talking about. the recent drop in US bond yields has not been accompanied by a similar drop in European rates.<br /><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9WpWVe8jEI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/kJSH2pGLGgs/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9WpWVe8jEI/AAAAAAAAAJ8/kJSH2pGLGgs/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" border="0"></a>Consequently the spread between US and foreign bonds has narrowed and it no longer compensates foreigners for the currency risk they take when investing in the US.<br />The consequences are a weak dollar. Note the opposite happened when Reagan first<br />created structural deficits and the dollar had to weaken enough to create a large enough<br />trade deficit to facilitate the capital inflow. At that point we had crowding out but it worked through the dollar to crowd out the manufacturing sector rather then the interest sensitive sectors.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9WpoFe8jFI/AAAAAAAAAKE/W6IkpKWogog/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9WpoFe8jFI/AAAAAAAAAKE/W6IkpKWogog/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" border="0"></a><br />It is also working against the Euro as you see the it strengthen when rates spreads widen.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9Wp4Fe8jGI/AAAAAAAAAKM/aCDA3v6yoRU/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9Wp4Fe8jGI/AAAAAAAAAKM/aCDA3v6yoRU/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" border="0"></a>When the US made itself dependent on foreign capital inflows the world got a lot more complex and it was no longer possible to analysis monetary or fiscal policy as if the US were a closed economy. I worry that we are now starting to see the bear case that I have worried about for years when international capital flows prevent the Fed from easing when domestic considerations call for it. I&#8217;m not making a forecast, I&#8217;m just laying out factors that make the analysis much more complex and that need to be brought into the analysis.</p>
<p>Maybe it is what we need to revive the manufacturing sector, and will be what drives the economy over the next decade. Save-the-rustbelt would love this. But, it creates inflation and real income complications for the rest of us.</p>
<p>I probably is what will happen since Don Boudreaux at the Cafe Hayek blog just got one of his letters to the FT published where he praised the trade deficit. I just base my analysis on the thesis that he is usually wrong.</p>
<p>I realize these charts are simple and the real world is more complex involving covered interest rate difference, etc, but they are adequate to make the point.</p>

<p>Just to put things in perspective, the inflation rate was 4.4%, the same as it is right now, when Nixon imposed price controls in 1971.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9Vf5Ve8jDI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/jdDnuFFmhAQ/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/R9Vf5Ve8jDI/AAAAAAAAAJ0/jdDnuFFmhAQ/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" border="0"></a><br />P.S. He knew the inflation rate was slowing. But he imposed price controls as part of his package to devalue the dollar because he expected the weak dollar to be inflationary.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/09/AR2008030901427.html">Sebastian Mallaby</a> writes about how the U.S. Federal Reserve is pursuing easy monetary policy to stimulate our aggregate demand while the European Central Bank is pursuing a tighter monetary policy on the concern that Europe might slip into an inflationary spiral from excessive aggregate demand:</p>
<blockquote><p>The divergence in approaches on either side of the Atlantic is likely to stoke tensions. Americans resent Europeans for not sharing the burden of stimulating the world economy, forcing them into unilateral action. Europeans resent Americans for blundering foolishly ahead, exacerbating inflation. For years there has been an unhealthy imbalance in the world economy, with the United States contributing disproportionately to the growth in demand and doing too little in the way of saving. The response to the current economic mess increases that lopsidedness. Americans are spending heavily to head off the risk of recession while Europeans close their wallets.</p></blockquote>
<p>One would think that we were still under the Bretton Woods regime of fixed exchange rates. OK, we might have a Bretton Woods II regime with certain Asian Central Banks avoiding the appreciation of their currencies with respect to the dollar. But as our graph shows – the value of the Euro has been rising with respect to the dollar, which tends to push U.S. net export demand as it tends to push down European net export demand.</p>

                                <p>Regular readers are aware that my wife and I are currently having to deal with both <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/correspondence-with-american-express.html">identity fraud</a> and an unrelated <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/correspondence-with-american-express.html">dispute over a very large credit charge</a>, both at the same time.</p>
<p>And that got me to thinking&#8230; one of the arguments you often hear to support the charge that the US incarcerates too many people is the high proportion of people in prison who are non-violent offenders. Now, I can understand that sentiment when it comes to pot-smokers or prostitutes or the like. But as to perpetrators of fraud&#8230; well, given the experience we&#8217;re going through right now, I&#8217;d rather have gotten beaten up the street and gotten a broken arm or leg than go through this. It would have caused much less aggravation and misery. And there are only so many people that a thug can beat up on a given day, whereas those who perpetrate frauds can cause all sorts of misery to a lot more people.</p>
<p>Nobody will ever give us back the time we lost for this mess or make up for the aggravation we&#8217;ve been put through. As far as I&#8217;m concerned, people who commit identity theft should pay a price that is much greater than the one they inflicted on others.</p>

<p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/03/whatever-happened-to-inflation.html">Greg Mankiw</a> is worried that inflationary expectations are increasing and <a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2008/03/the-natural-rate-of-unemployment-in-the-us-is-rising-the-fed-should-consider-raising-rates">William Buiter</a> argues that the Federal Reserve should reverse its easy monetary policy.  But didn’t we just learn that the employment to population ratio fell from 62.9% to 62.7%.  So how does Dr. Buiter reach the conclusion that the labor market is too strong?</p>
<blockquote><p>The latest labour market figures show a large fall in employment and an even larger fall in labour supply, resulting in an actual decline in the unemployment rate to 4.8%. There is also evidence to support the view that the natural (equilibrium) rate of unemployment in the US is increasing. The combination of a declining actual unemployment rate and a rising natural unemployment rate means that there are now higher domestic inflationary pressures associated with any observed level of employment and unemployment than before.  It will be argued that the labour supply data are unreliable, as they are based on the Household Survey. And so they are. But the employment data are unreliable also. And the decline in the recorded labour supply is not a one-month wonder. It has been in the data for quite a while, so I will believe it is real until I see convincing evidence of the contrary.  It makes economic sense that the US natural rate of unemployment is increasing, if only because of compositional changes in the labour force that are reducing, on average, its quality and employability. The post-9/11 imposition of additional obstacles to the immigration of skilled labour are one factor reducing labour force flexibility. So is the long-standing decline in the numeracy and literacy standards of the high-school graduates.  At the same time, the need for greater changes in the mix of skills and in the geographical and industrial distribution of employment associated with globalisation and accelerating technological change, have raised the degree of flexibility required to maintain the same amount of effective labour market pressure at a given level of the conventionally measured unemployment rate. The US is not responding, except defensively by threatening a retreat into protectionism.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/03/the-natural-rat.html">Mark Thoma</a> has an interesting discussion of how the natural rate of unemployment can vary over time but there are a couple of caveats here.  Mark is not necessarily agreeing with Buiter’s contention.  We should also note that there have been several economists (yes including me) that have advocated looking at this from a natural rate of the employment to population ratio – which admittedly can also vary over time. </p>
<p>Buiter seems to be under the impression that the all of the fall in the labor force participation rate is associated with a voluntary withdrawal of labor supply.  I have to wonder.  I have not update our graph of the labor force participation rate (LFP) and the employment to population ratio (EP), but it seems to be conveying the same message of why the unemployment rate (which is one minus the ratio of EP to LFP) is such a lousy measure of the state of the labor market.  Ever since the 2001 recession and the slow and somewhat anemic recovery, LFP has declined from more than 67% to less than 66%.  </p>
<p>Now if all of this decline in LFP were voluntary, then maybe Buiter’s argument makes sense.  I once put forth the proposition that the natural rate of EP was 64% and was accused of assuming that none of the decline in LFP were voluntary.  Maybe the truth is somewhere in the middle, which would then beg the question as to whether the natural rate of EP is some number like 63.5%, some number a bit above 63.5%, or perhaps even some number just under 63.5%.  But I find it incredulous to believe that the natural rate of EP has fallen from 64% to something near 62.5%.  Had Buiter presented clear evidence that the current EP exceeds its natural rate, I might agree for his call for tight money.  But he really has not made the case – has he?</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: A little comic relief.  We know that Lawrence Kudlow has recently come down on the side of tight monetary policy as he fears inflation so it’s interesting that he agrees with <a href="http://kudlowsmoneypolitics.blogspot.com/2008/03/ryding-has-it-right.html">John Ryding</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am for economic stimulus. Don’t get me wrong. But I am for real economic stimulus which is cutting tax rates. Because this market is short of a few things: It’s short of liquidity—the Fed can deal with that. It’s short of capital. If we want more capital, we should start increasing the returns to capital, and cutting tax rates, or at least making tax cuts permanent. This is very important &#8230; You’ve got to get Washington to deliver on tax cuts and incentives.</p></blockquote>
<p>Isn’t this the macroeconomic policy mix during 1981 that gave us a collapse of net exports from an overly strong dollar (something <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/kudlow-on-reagans-strong-dollar-policy_04.html">Kudlow endorses</a>) and the 1982 recession?  Of course, we could have a massive fiscal stimulus with little in the way of tight money, which might be inflationary if Buiter is even remotely correct about the labor market.  Leave it to a clown like Kudlow to endorse such a disastrous policy mix!</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2008_03/013288.php">Kevin Drum</a> finds a few past examples for this possibility:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is John McCain really likely to use these attacks in TV ads during the general election? I couldn&#8217;t think of any examples of this from past elections, so I asked the hive mind if they could think of any &#8230; are there any examples of general election candidates using primary criticisms as part of their own campaign? The short answer is yes, but apparently not very recently and not very often.</p></blockquote>
<p>He found a few with the last two from the 1980 campaign.  We’ll return to George H. W. Bush’s voodoo economics but first let’s listen to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErosyL95VqA">this video</a> of Ted Kennedy that was used by a group called Democrats for Reagan. A little historical context.  The 1980 campaign was run with the backdrop of the 1980 recession, which was brought on by the high interest rate policies of the Volcker FED.  These policies were designed to bring down inflation.  Not every Democrat agreed with this policy. James Tobin was particularly bothered by the use of a recession to reduce inflation.  We all watched the Republicans grasp the mantle of full employment promising to restore aggregate demand through a tax cut.</p>
<p>I had thought Senator Kennedy’s condemnation of high interest rates was along the same lines.  But listen again – he is also complaining about high inflation.  In defense of the Volcker FED – had we pursued policies to substantially increase aggregate demand, inflation might have stayed high.  Which bring us back to voodoo economics.  As Kevin notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>George Bush&#8217;s &#8220;voodoo economics&#8221; line against Reagan was used by Carter and others. It didn&#8217;t show up in an ad, as far as I can tell, but during Carter&#8217;s October 29 debate with Reagan he said, &#8220;Governor Reagan recently mentioned the Reagan-Kemp-Roth proposal, which his own running mate, George Bush, described as &#8216;voodoo economics&#8217; and said that it would result in a 30 percent inflation rate.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I had always thought the Reaganites were promising too much when they claimed that we could restore full employment and low inflation at the same time.  James Tobin often ridiculed this claim.  Now we did see inflation come down quite quickly but that’s due to the 1982 recession and the only gradual return to full employment over the two terms that Reagan served as President.  This speech is probably not one of Ted Kennedy’s finer moments – to say the least.</p>

                                <p>OK, we did have one nutcase toss a bomb at a military recruiting station near Grand Central Station.  But that was at 3:45 AM and no one was hurt.  <a href="http://stateoftheday.blogspot.com/2008/03/john-mccain-americas-neighborhoods-are.html">State of the Day</a> catches John McCain saying this:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;There are problems in America with safe neighborhoods&#8221; just like Baghdad. Watch it (and watch how he catches himself, but still can&#8217;t put the genie back in the bottle).  Funny, I was just reading about the rash of car bombs, suicide bombers, and headless homicides here in city. Maybe it&#8217;s time for a &#8220;surge&#8221; in Manhattan too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Darn – I thought my new neighborhood was safe.  I thought Mayor Bloomberg and the NYC police were doing a great job.  If McCain is right, we’ll need a lot of help from the Federal government.  But how to pay for the surge of security forces in NYC if a President McCain doesn’t want to raise taxes?  Never mind the costs of all those new wars that a President McCain will bring us.</p>

<blockquote><p>On Social Security, the Arizona senator says he still backs a system of private retirement accounts that President Bush pushed unsuccessfully, and disowned details of a Social Security proposal on his campaign Web site.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://corner.nationalreview.com/post/?q=ZTQ4NjJhZmRkNGE2MmE0OWUxNDEyMDMzY2I2ODQ5NGQ=">Ramesh Ponnuru</a> notes the change in McCain’s position:<br />
<blockquote>He was for the personal savings accounts Bush wanted; his campaign website says that he wants accounts that &#8220;supplement&#8221; Social Security rather than being carved out from it; and he says he still wants personal savings accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is true but then Ponnuru makes one of the most uninformed comments on this issue that I have ever read:</p>
<blockquote><p> But the distinction between accounts that are &#8220;add-ons&#8221; versus &#8220;carve-outs&#8221; is pretty meaningless, and I don&#8217;t think it is wrong of the candidate to ignore it.</p></blockquote>
<p>At least <a href="http://voxbaby.blogspot.com/2006/06/carveouts.html">Andrew Samwick</a> understands the difference between the carve-out proposal and the add-on proposal.  No one who remotely understands the Social Security debate would claim that the distinction between add-ons and carve-outs is meaningless.  Then again – Ponnuru was writing over at the National Review’s The Corner where completely uninformed commentary appears to be the rule.</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Uga Bardi at the <a href="http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/3551#more">Oildrum</a> has written an excellent piece,&#8221;The Cassandra Curse: How  <i>The Limits to Growth was Demonized</i>,&#8221; tracing the reception of this seminal work from the time of its publication (1972) to the present day. We all are acquainted with its predecessor, Thomas Malthus&#8217; &#8220;An Essay on the Principle of Population.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a boy, I thought Malthus was essentially correct: The earth can feed only so many. Of course, Malthus would never have expected us to be so successful for so long.</p>
<p>I remember a <i>Star Trek</i> piece where the unfortunate Captain Kirk was imprisoned on a massively overpopulated planet, the inhabitants of which enjoyed perfect health in a perfectly crowded hell. In usual science fiction fashion, Bixby had taken one question&#8211;What if we had perfect health and immortality?&#8211;and set its consequences against exponential population growth. In my naiveté , I kept asking: Where were the bathrooms? This planet had people standing cheek to jowl!  How did they move? Where do they grow stuff? But then, of course, the <i>Enterprise</i> had that marvelous transmutation device.  Matter could simply be transformed. And the energy cost? Those mysterious crystals in the ship&#8217;s core handled that.</p>
<p>Infinite growth may be the stuff only of science fiction, bad writing, and bad acting&#8230;with lots of liberally sprinkled fairy dust.  Yet, today, are we ignoring those limits at our peril? How much fairy dust do we have left?</p>
<p>The usual rebuttal to Malthus or to the MIT authors of <i>The Limits to Growth</i> is: &#8220;Well, they were wrong in their predictions! Look at us: Partying on, dude!&#8221; But one wise commentator, Big Gav, on the Oildrum threat noted the following:<br />
<blockquote>Reminds me of a time when I was part of an academic workshop and brought up Limits to Growth with one of my colleagues (who I really like and respect) and he blurted out &#8220;but they got all their predictions wrong.&#8221; I just stopped in my tracks, dumbfounded, because I had just read the book and it appeared to have done just the opposite: not making any &#8220;firm&#8221; predictions, while still developing frightening scenarios that looked eerily familiar when reading the news.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, the MIT authors made no concrete predictions; they set no dates for Armageddon or our eventual comeuppance. They did, however, state a time frame: the 21st century.</p>
<p>What interested me most in Bardi&#8217;s piece were the four groups that the Italian economist Georgio Nebbia identified as constitutionally critical of the idea of any limits to growth:</p>
<ol>
<li>Businesses and industries who saw the idea as a threat to their continued growth</li>
<li>Professional economists who saw LTG as a threat to their dominance in advising on economic matters</li>
<li>The Catholic Church with its opposition to birth control</li>
<li>The Liberal Left that saw the LTG study as a scam of the ruling class, designed to trick workers into believing that the proletarian paradise was not a practical goal</li>
</ol>
<p>The first group, business leaders, is easy to understand. Business is predicated on growth. The stock market trembles when profits are stagnant. The Fed worries about recession. Credit is eased; interest rates are lowered to promote investment and continued growth.</p>
<p>Armies of economists are summoned; arguments erupt from the right and from the left on how to make the train go faster. More arguments erupt if the train even hints of slowing. Who is to blame? How much ink and paper has been expanded on the causes of the latest slowdown?</p>
<p>All of which explains the second group, the economists. Livelihoods and professorships are at stake. They are the foot soldiers.</p>
<p>In the third group, the Catholic Church, I would include the religious right or any group that looks on birth control as fundamentally against God&#8217;s law. This group believes that God has ordained us to multiply&#8211;apparently to infinity&#8211;and prosper. Besides, you can &#8220;swamp&#8221; the religious opposition through sheer numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Prosper,&#8221; how neatly that word fits into the language of the first two groups. Business prospers when there are more customers.</p>
<p>Clearly, an individual in any one of these groups might not personally believe in the aims of any of the others. Many business leaders and economists would support birth control. Some religious leaders would cry out against Mammon and greed. There is in-fighting and disagreements among them. But when we step back and look at the broader picture, they all share the same belief; they all are in the same army. All believe that continued, exponential growth is possible. Each brings to that conviction elements that aid the aims of the others.</p>
<p>The fourth and last group, the Liberal Left, has a role to play as well. It offers hope to those being left behind as the system becomes distorted, as more and more wealth is accumulated at the top. While it may disagree with the Church on birth control or even in its brand of theism, it does share the Church&#8217;s concern for the great underclass. We can save these people; we can make their lives better. Prosperity is a practical goal for all.</p>
<p>I hear all these voices every day&#8230;on every blog. I remember asking Jim Hamilton if zero growth was viable. He answered, &#8220;Yes.&#8221; I wonder if he would be happy with zero growth; would anyone be happy with zero growth? And what in this world or any other does it look like?</p>
