<blockquote><p>Worcester, Massachusetts &#8211; On Lagrange Street in New England&#8217;s second-largest city, two brick apartment buildings stand side-by-side in varying stages of decay &#8211; boarded up, &#8220;No Trespassing&#8221; signs affixed, paint peeling.<br />Across the street, a condominium complex is on the brink. Three of its eight apartments are in foreclosure.</p>
<p>Like many cities in the United States where the home vacancy rate has scaled its highest since records began in 1956, the former textile mill city of Worcester in Massachusetts is turning to the courts to fight back.</p>
<p>Their target: banks who abandon properties and who leave behind a glut of empty, dilapidated houses that draw crime, cut tax revenue and depress nearby property values in a market already in a tailspin.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the trenches here. We&#8217;ve got to stabilize our community,&#8221; said Worcester city manager Michael O&#8217;Brien in a sidewalk interview outside the foreclosed condominiums on the quiet street in a Hispanic neighborhood.</p>
<p>The city of 175,898 people, a munitions depot during the U.S. Revolutionary War, offers a window into how U.S. cities are grappling with a wave of foreclosures that has pushed the U.S. homeowner vacancy rate to a record 2.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2007 &#8211; or about 1 million homes.</p>
<p>Like many U.S. mayors and city officials, O&#8217;Brien blames &#8220;predatory&#8221; lending practices prevalent in the U.S. property boom for the lion&#8217;s share of about 4,220 mortgages in his city that are either in, or at risk of, foreclosure.</p>
<p>In February, he began asking judges to assign property managers to buildings at the expense of the mortgage companies. The idea is to stop tenants from being abruptly tossed out of a foreclosed home and to provide enough basic maintenance to keep it from getting condemned.</p></blockquote>
<p>Buffalo<br />Cleveland<br />Detroit<br />Syracuse<br />Baltimore<br />Providence</p>
<p>The question of ownership and responsibility is indeed important, and the questions of costs are indeed not a Wall St. or Washington DC concern yet. There are creative responses given that the mandate to city governments is to survive&#8230;in many fashions. This list is a rustbelt special.</p>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/tr08.pdf">new Social Security Trustee&#8217;s report</a> just came out.  I&#8217;m not even going to touch it &#8211; I&#8217;m confident that Bruce Webb and Dale Coberly, both of whom have comments here at Angry Bear regularly, and have posts here on occasion as well, will eventually go through it and write something up.  There&#8217;s no question they know this material much better than I.</p>
<p>Bruce did send a quick e-mail, quoting from the report&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/index.html">summary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The annual cost of Social Security benefits represented 4.3 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2007 and is projected to increase to 6.1 percent of GDP in 2035, and then decline to 5.8 percent of GDP by 2048 and remain at that level. The projected 75-year actuarial deficit in the combined Old-Age and Survivors and Disability Insurance (OASDI) Trust Fund is 1.70 percent of taxable payroll ($4.3 trillion in present value terms), down from 1.95 percent projected in last year&#8217;s report. This decrease is due primarily to changes in projection methods.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bruce&#8217;s comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Wow, a decrease in payroll gap of a full .25 points and 75 year actuarial deficit down from $4.7 to $4.3 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>Something about the Trustee&#8217;s Reports that come out every year make me think of a dog my Mom had when I was a kid.  When I was a kid and my family was living in Brazil, my Mom got a puppy.   A month later, the dog got sick and we were told the dog wasn&#8217;t going to last.  A couple months later, the dog was dying of something else.  Every few months, the dog came down with something, and she just wasn&#8217;t going to survive.  The process continued for many years.  The dog, who would travel more than most people and live in 3 different cities in 2 different continents, eventually died at age 14, which is pretty old for a big dog.</p>

                                <p>Are there two Lawrence Kudlows?  One keeps writing that we should promote a <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/kudlow-calls-for-net-export-led.html">strong dollar</a> policy and then there is <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MzQ4YTgwYTk2YmI2YTQ1NDQ5YmI5M2Y1ZDIwOWQyMzM=">this one</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have really learned to like Ben Bernanke. He’s the man. And his interest-rate cuts are vastly more effective than the so-called economic-stimulus rebate plan coming out of Congress and the White House.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not new for Kudlow.  He has bashed the FED for expansionary monetary policy and then argued in favor of easier monetary policy a few days later on several occasions.  I just wonder if the folks at the National Review are smart to enough to realize what a flip-flopper clown this fellow really is.</p>

<blockquote><p>The pity party thrown last week by the WSJ for Bear&#8217;s senior, er, management appears to have omitted some data:</p>
<p>Insiders at Bear sold a total of 715,000 shares last year worth more than $75 million, up from 2006 but down considerably from 2004, when sales of more than 1.5 million shares worth $147.9 million took place, the data show.<br />Since 2000, <strong>Cayne</strong> has sold 2.37 million shares worth about $182.7 million, while <strong>Schwartz</strong> has sold more than one million shares for roughly $67.2 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is tough living even if they made nothing this year.</p>

<blockquote><p>Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf said the financial crisis is presenting the bank with more acquisition opportunities.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would not be averse to a Fed-assisted transaction,&#8221; Stumpf said in a recent interview with the San Francisco Business Times. &#8220;Fixer-uppers don&#8217;t bother us.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve already <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/ben-bernanke-nigerian-who-is-actually.html">made the same offer</a> to the Fed:</p>
<blockquote><p>Memo to Ben Bernanke: when the next stone is ready to hit the water (Lehman?), give me the money and I&#8217;ll buy it. Thanks dude.</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly who would be averse to getting the same deal as JP Morgan &#8211; a guarantee they won&#8217;t lose money if they buy up a dead-beat?  And why should this opportunity only go to the big guys?  Give me a guarantee I won&#8217;t lose money buying any of these deadbeat banks and you can bet I raise the funds quickly.  So why is this a game that only the big guys are allowed to play?  </p>
<p>This sounds like I&#8217;m kidding, but I&#8217;m not.  See, the folks who are pushing for these bailouts keep telling us that the economy might implode without them.  OK.  If that were true (and I don&#8217;t believe it for a minute), and its important to keep the deadbeat banks around, does it really matter if the sweetheart deal goes to me instead of JP Morgan or Wells Fargo?  Its one thing to push for bailouts to &#8220;save the economy&#8221; no matter how shaky that argument might be. Its another to insist that the folks who get the payoffs from the Fed and the government have to be&#8230; the same folks who have always gotten the payoffs.</p>

                                <p>Noni Mausa sends a link to <a href="http://polmeth.wustl.edu/retrieve.php?id=740">this paper</a> (warning:  PDF!!!) by Andy Eggers and Jens Hainmueller.  Here&#8217;s the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>While the role of money in policymaking is a central question in political economy research, surprisingly little attention has been given to the rents politicians actually derive from politics. We use both matching and a regression discontinuity design to analyze an original dataset on the estates of recently deceased British politicians. We find that serving in Parliament roughly doubled the wealth at death of Conservative MPs but had no discernible effect on the wealth of Labour MPs. We argue that Conservative MPs profited from office in a lax regulatory environment by using their political positions to obtain outside work as directors, consultants, and lobbyists, both while in office and after retirement. Our results are consistent with anecdotal evidence on MPs&#8217; outside Financial dealings but suggest that the magnitude of Conservatives&#8217; financial gains from office was larger than has been appreciated.</p></blockquote>
<p>Noni also asks whether this can be applied to American politicians.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the data to apply it to American politicians, and I&#8217;ll confess I only had the time to skim through the paper, but my thoughts:</p>
<p>1.  The results of the paper seem plausible to me<br />2.  I think you would see a similar difference if you looked at congresscritters<br />3.  I think part of the reason for the difference is that conservatives, politicians and otherwise, seem to confuse what is good for them with <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">what is good for the country</a> more than liberals.  I imagine some of them behave that way for more, um, direct reasons.<br />4.  My guess is that this effect isn&#8217;t simply one where the more conservative you are, the better you do.  While I do feel that extreme liberals probably do worse than centrist liberals, and centrist liberals do worse than centrist conservatives, I imagine the far right doesn&#8217;t do as well as centrist conservatives.  </p>
<p>Anyway, your thoughts about the study, what it may mean here in the US, and how to go about testing it?</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/03/grim-outlook-for-jp-morgan.html">Yves Smith</a> has a post about JPM&#8217;s buyout of Bear Stearns, that, coincidentally, says something that I was thinking when I woke up this morning.  If I hadn&#8217;t read his post, I might have written something like this myself after letting it simmer for a bit:</p>
<blockquote><p>A hedge fund correspondent pointed us to an article at Institutional Risk Analytics on the Bear-JP Morgan deal. While we don&#8217;t subscribe to its view that Bear was &#8220;raped&#8221; (please, the firm was going to file for bankruptcy a week ago Monday), it contains an intriguing analysis of JP Morgan.</p>
<p>Differing with popular opinion, IRA argues that JPM is far from a financially strong institution. It has the highest gearing of any of the three large US banks (and remember, that includes the CDO-laden, walking wounded Citigroup) and by their measures, also has the highest level of economic risk per their metrics. JPM&#8217;s chickens have not yet come home to roost because its book is heavily weighed toward consumer business, and those problems are coming to the fore later. (The cognoscenti may take issue with their use of RAROC as another measure, but I&#8217;m not troubled when making cross company comparisons if you have access only to published financials).</p>
<p>Although IRA does not say so explicitly, the reasoning appears to be that the Fed pushed Bear into JPM&#8217;s arms as a way to shore up JPM. If asking a firm to take on a $13 trillion derivatives book, of which only $2 trillion is exchange traded, is a favor, I&#8217;d hate to see what punishment looks like.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Fed is guaranteeing JPM it will cover any losses if JPM buys BS.  That started out as a $2 a share gift to BS shareholders (since the value of BS&#8217; assets without any assurances from the Fed are exceeded by its obligations) and now that gift seems about to get sweetened.</p>
<p>But&#8230;  I was wondering, why not give the gift directly?  Why do it in this convoluted way?  My first thought was &#8211; well, if you go through JPM, its somewhat more opaque (and hence less likely to raise the taxpayer&#8217;s ire).  But the Fed could be opaque in more direct ways too&#8230;  which leaves one thing&#8230;  for whatever reason, the Fed wants to provide a gift to JPM too.</p>
<p>And BTW, <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/03/efficient-markets-and-stock-arbitrage.html">Ken Houghton</a> has another collection of follow-ups to this mess.</p>

                                <p>Reader ILSM has sent in a few posts in recent weeks about the military&#8217;s decision to replace its existing fleet of fuel tankers.  (See <a rhef="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/ilsm-on-why-airbus-tanker-won-usaf.html">here</a> and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/ilsm-on-new-air-refueling-tanker.html">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Today, he sends in a follow-up&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>A little more on what is &#8220;superior&#8221;, and is it worth the extra money sent to Airbus?.</p>
<p>From a logistics standpoint there is a lot of baggage [Caesar called it impedimenta] to deploy an Army or Marine Corps brigade sized formation, 1000 C-17 sorties to deliver 5000 troops and 700 plus vehicles, 100 plus sorties per day to sustain the formation in a place where there is not enough fuel to fill the airlifters going out with medivacs and retrograde logistics. If you have to refuel in the air to get them in it is highly unlikely there will be any fuel at destination to get them out. Or run any mechanized infantry operations. The likelihood of this mission succeeding is remote. The costs to attempt it huge. Think the Khe Sanh seige with the support bases 5000 miles away.</p>
<p>Only priceless to the generals and their careers with Northrop or Boeing or Lockheed.</p>
<p>Remote southwest Asia places with no infrastructure pose no danger to the US. Unless we want to re-enact Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a quaote from a Seattle Post Intelligencer story on March 21st (Bloomberg News Tony Capaccio): </p>
<blockquote><p>The Air Force would require 22 fewer Northrop [Airbus 18 wheelers] tankers to meet classified homeland defense and combat scenarios [Do not know if it is brigade sized] covering the Pacific and Southwest Asia required in the competition, according to a document that outlined the service&#8217;s selection criteria.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, a key decision is based on classified scenario.  Many wasteful blunders are hidden behind the national security need to keep the public in the dark about how their money is wasted.</p>
<p>We do not know the feasibility of doing the classified mission at all given the huge amounts of fuel required in such remote regions.</p>
<p>The &#8220;saving&#8221; of 22 tankers [pick up truck sized] is at what costs [using 18 wheelers for the 99.97% of the tasks not needing an 18 wheeler]? The more airplanes represents redundancy [multiple server queuing model], but the classified scenario is for people buying in to the mistake.</p>
<p>Before McCain killed the KC 767 in 2003 the Air Force used footprint, and weight as deciding factors.  The KC 767 is lighter requires less &#8220;real estate&#8221; and will operate out of more airfields and have a significantly lower operating costs [24% less fuel, proportionately less supply and maintenance].</p>
<p>The A330 maximum gross take off weight: 507,000 pounds, wing span:  198 feet</p>
<p>The B767 maximum gross take off weight: 395,000 pounds, wing span: 156 feet</p>
<p>Unit prices of the two airplanes are similarly different but phony Airbus subsidized pricing was used by the selecting official.  Weight is a determining factor in both unit cost to deliver the airplane and operating costs.  The Air Force somehow derived the life cycle cost for the two very diverse airplanes to be the same.  This would only be possible if the A330 fleet were reduced to 139 airplanes.  I doubt that the number of airplanes was reduced.</p>
<p>A Boeing study with an independent analyst estimates the 767 to use 24% less fuel over the same outcomes as the A330. This is consistent with the weigh difference.</p>
<p>Loren Thompson has more detail on the Air Force scoring <a href="http://lexingtoninstitute.org/printer_1234.shtml">here</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>The teams tied in most measures [of &#8220;capability&#8221;, an arcane Rumsfeldian term for desk flying strategist dreams of what&#8217;s good for the future structure of the DoD and industry where the good second careers are], but the Northrop offering was deemed to offer superior refueling and airlift capacity {Note capacity is not &#8220;capability&#8221;, capacity is the load, &#8220;capability&#8221; is the long term utility and revenue products of the system, larger loads on fewer flights means the system needs serious reliability and dependability, not to get wonky on what the Europeans don&#8217;t do well] at 1,000 nm. range and substantially superior refueling and airlift capability [dissembling here he means capacity, capability is not going to be proven until the USAF realizes it has another too expensive undependable system] at 2,000 nm. range. The superior airlift capacity of Northrop&#8217;s plane was deemed a &#8220;compelling&#8221; consideration in giving Northrop the edge for this factor.</p></blockquote>
<p>Air fields supporting refueling of heavy airlifters require either huge storage and time to fill it or dedicated pipeline delivery of enough fuel for the cargo planes.</p>
<p>The marginal utility of the 2000 nm offload is approximately zero.</p>
<p>The only use of this kind of mix of range and weight is subject to being classified as it is a ridiculous operation and national security demands citizens not know that the Air Force buys stuff to do the ridiculous at huge costs.</p>
<p>The acquisition officials will assure you the decisions were made on &#8220;best value&#8221;, but the definition of &#8220;best value&#8221; is arcane and has to be classified.</p>
<p>There are over 400 &#8216;missions areas&#8217; in the military industrial complex a few much larger, many about the same expense, all of which are bought at &#8220;best value&#8221; to deliver capabilities that not linked to any real threat.</p>
<p>So, bottom line, national security demands the waste of 4% of GDP so that the generals benefit and buy things to do what will never be done.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

<blockquote><p>In reality, of course, the US does not have a dollar policy – other than letting the market determine its value. The US government does not intervene in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar, and the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy certainly is not directed toward such a goal. Nor is the Fed specifically aiming to lower the dollar’s value. Although cutting the Federal Funds interest rate from 5.25% in the summer of 2007 to 3% now contributes to dollar depreciation, this has been aimed at stimulating a weakening economy … the Treasury’s only explicit currency goal now is to press the Chinese to raise the value of the renminbi, thereby reducing the dollar’s global trade-weighted average. The pressure on China is, however, entirely consistent with the broader US policy of encouraging countries to allow the financial market to determine their currencies’ exchange rate. There is, of course, truth to the statement that a strong dollar benefits the American public, since it allows Americans to buy foreign products at a lower cost in dollars. But, while the declining dollar does reduce Americans’ purchasing power, the magnitude of this effect is not large, because imports account for only about 15% of US gross domestic product. A 20% dollar depreciation would therefore reduce Americans’ purchasing power by only 3%. At the same time, the lower dollar makes American products more competitive in global markets, leading to increased exports and reduced imports. The dollar has declined during the past two years against not only the euro but also against most other currencies, including the Japanese yen and the renminbi. On a real trade-weighted basis, the dollar is down about 13% relative to its value in March 2006. This improved competitiveness of American goods and services is needed to shrink the massive US trade deficit. Even with the dollar’s decline and the resulting 25% rise in US exports over the past two years, the US still had an annualized trade deficit at the end of fourth quarter of 2007 of about $700 billion (5% of GDP). Because US imports are nearly twice as large as US exports, it takes a 20% increase in exports to balance a 10% increase in imports. That means that the dollar must fall substantially further to shrink the trade deficit to a sustainable level.</p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed – the dollar devaluation enhances the potency of expansionary monetary policy as it tries to alleviate the impending recession.  While Feldstein concedes that European policy makers are concerned about the recent dollar devaluation, he notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Instead of simply wishing that the dollar would stop falling, European governments need to take steps to stimulate domestic demand to replace the loss of sales and jobs that will otherwise accompany the more competitive dollar. This is not an easy task, because the European Central Bank must remain vigilant about rising inflation, and because many EU countries maintain large fiscal deficits. While the ECB has limited room for maneuver, regulatory changes and revenue-neutral shifts in the tax structure (for example, a temporary investment tax credit financed by a temporary increase in the corporate tax rate) could provide the stimulus needed to offset declining net exports. It is therefore important that EU governments turn their attention to this challenge.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words – if there is a concern that European aggregate demand might also fall, let the European governments join the US in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/bruce-bartlett-wants-more-effective.html">smart fiscal policy</a>.  Oh wait!</p>

                                <p>Regular readers know I&#8217;ve been working on a book with a co-author who will, for the moment, remain nameless.  We completed a first draft a month or so ago, and have attracted some interest from a good agent, who will also, for the moment, remain nameless.</p>
<p>The book looks at a range of topics, from economic growth to abortion to crime to wage growth, and ranks presidents on how they did.  It also provides a bit of explanation for why we see what we did.  Its an approach similar to one I&#8217;ve followed on many posts here, and so should look familiar to Angry Bear readers.</p>
<p>But&#8230;  the agent came back with some comments, and to be honest, I agree with them.  So I figured I&#8217;d ask for some suggestions on how to deal with the two main (related) problems:</p>
<p>1.  Our agent says he felt he was suffering from information overflow.  One chapter is fine, two is better, but after a few chapters, its almost too much information.<br />2.  The book reads like a series of unconnected essays, and doesn&#8217;t have some backbone that ties it all it together.</p>
<p>So, in effect, we need some sort of connective tissue and narrative that makes it all come together, plus a bit less information.  Anyone have any suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>
