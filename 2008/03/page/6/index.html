<blockquote><p>I was curious if the <a href="http://www.occ.treas.gov/">OCC</a> preempting the State&#8217;s rights to control banking had any part in this mortgage crisis?</p></blockquote>
<p>I honestly have no idea.  Your thoughts?</p>

                                <p>We&#8217;ve had a lot of fun with stuff written by Steve Forbes here at Angry Bear.  But the magazine that bears his (or his father&#8217;s) name publishes humor by others as well.  </p>
<p>I was going to respond to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/sammy-on-freedom-and-competitive.html">Sammy&#8217;s post</a> in the comments to that post, but figured my response could stand alone.  Sammy quotes <a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/opinions/2008/03/22/america-compete-innovation-oped-cx_jcmn_0325compete.html">this article</a> in Forbes by Jim Clifton, CEO of the Gallup Organization and C. L. Max Nikias, Provost of the University of Southern California.  They tell us:</p>
<blockquote><p>A quarter of a century ago, most leading economists&#8211;whether liberal or conservative&#8211;predicted that American economic growth would fall behind Japan and Germany by 2007. They typically estimated that Japan&#8217;s annual gross domestic product would be roughly $5 trillion by now, with Germany at around $4 trillion, and the U.S. lagging behind at roughly $3.5 trillion.</p>
<p>The predictions for Japan and Germany were reasonably accurate. But America grew to $13 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>The BEA tells us that the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">nominal GDP for the US in 1983 was 3.5 trillion</a>.  I wonder if the authors or Forbes magazine would care to produce a list of these leading economists who were predicting that the US&#8217; nominal GDP would not grow at all in 25 years, especially considering the early 80s were characterized by fears of high inflation.  I do remember predictions from that time of how Japan was going to take over the world.  I don&#8217;t have time to look any of &#8217;em up right now, but I do wonder how many of those predictions appeared in Forbes magazine at the time.</p>
<p>One final observation &#8211; since they&#8217;re looking for reasons why the US has not performed badly in the past twenty-five years, and considering that the positions of authority these guys are in, I would humbly suggest they scratch &#8220;meritocracy&#8221; from their list.</p>

<p>Maybe freedom is America&#8217;s competitive advantage?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/home/opinions/2008/03/22/america-compete-innovation-oped-cx_jcmn_0325compete.html">America The Unconventional</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Even the most decent, charismatic or bold politicians tend to adhere to conventional wisdom and conventional prescriptions in addressing America&#8217;s economic future. In doing so, they miss the point that it is the unconventional that has driven America&#8217;s recent success, and the unconventional that must drive our future success.</p>
<p>A quarter of a century ago, most leading economists&#8211;whether liberal or conservative&#8211;predicted that American economic growth would fall behind Japan and Germany by 2007. They typically estimated that Japan&#8217;s annual gross domestic product would be roughly $5 trillion by now, with Germany at around $4 trillion, and the U.S. lagging behind at roughly $3.5 trillion.</p>
<p>The predictions for Japan and Germany were reasonably accurate. But America grew to $13 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>America&#8217;s surprising economic growth has been traced back to some 1,000 key innovators, entrepreneurs, rainmakers, mentors and creative geniuses&#8211;some 60% of whom were foreign-born persons who were educated at American universities.<br />This meant that the U.S. had a unique edge in terms of the talent and the environment that was necessary for growth. The revolutions of technology&#8211;in electronics, in space technology and satellite communications, in personal computing, in the Internet and in information technology&#8211;were all American revolutions. The U.S. innovated while others imitated.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Just as yesterday&#8217;s conventional wisdom held that Japan and Germany would pass us by, today&#8217;s conventional wisdom holds that other nations soon will exceed us in skills and productivity. Yet by maintaining our edge in the unconventional things&#8211;especially in our ability to innovate while others continue to imitate&#8211;America will remain the pacesetter in this still-young century</p></blockquote>
<p>sammy comments: </p>
<p>1)  The collective (regulation/taxation/nationalization) diminishes the individualism that fosters innovation.  For example, what will price controls and/or nationalization do to the health care field?</p>
<p>2)  Those 1,000 key innovators, guess which tax bracket they fall into?</p>
<p>3)  Freedom to succeed also means the freedom to fail, meaning there will be crackups such as the housing bubble. </p>
<p>4)  Bonus for the liberals errr progressives that read the link, there is potentially a place for government help.</p>

                                <p>An article by Peter Bernstein is circulating that is such a good analysis of the economic environment that I though it was worth posting on Angry Bear.</p>
<p><strong>The  Shape Of The Future</strong></p>
<p>By Peter L. Bernstein</p>
<blockquote><p>Three months ago, we wrote, &#8220;[T]he economic malaise will not be brief, even  though its depth is uncertain. The process is going to be like water torture &#8211;  drip by drip by drip over an extended period of time until all these excesses  are squeezed out of the system and new and happier horizons can open up.&#8221; This  metaphor should now form the basis for all decisions, strategies, and analysis.  Recessions matter, but the important features of the problems faced by the  American economy are not in the short run. The crucial issue is the nature of  the new longer-run environment that we are convinced is now a reality. This  environment is still in its infancy, but its principal features are already  identifiable.
<p>Too few people are thinking along these terms. The short run always tends to  dominate mass thinking in any case, but in an odd way the short run is  irrelevant to the current situation. The short run is a creature of the  immediate past. The longer run will be a profound break from the past. Indeed,  the longer run in this instance is going to evolve as it is going to evolve  whether we have a perceptible recession in 2008 or whether we squeeze by with a  minimum of negative numbers.</p>
<p>Why are we so emphatic about this viewpoint? As Goldilocks shreds, we have to  start thinking about what kind of long-term environment is going to replace it.  Shifts to new environments are always attenuated. They are also rare across  time, which means most of us have limited experience with this phenomenon. New  environments often tend to sneak up on us and do not announce themselves with a  fanfare. Most of us are unaware of what has happened until enough time passes to  provide good perspective. </p>
<p>Imagine, for example, what would have happened if investors had been willing  to think through the powerful positive implications of the disinflationary  forces that set in during the early 1980s after Paul Volcker had turned the tide  of inflation. Instead, backward-focused investors in fear of renewed outbreaks  of inflation ignored the way these new trends would lead to a radical  improvement in economic stability and opportunity. The record of long-term  interest rates in those years is eloquent testimony to the bias toward the  past: although yields on ten-year Treasuries broke briefly below 8% in  the wake of the oil price break in 1986, they were back up over 8% in 1987 and  averaged over 8% for the next two years. Meanwhile, inflation averaged only  4.3%. Clearly, nobody was willing even to think about what the victory over  inflation could produce. Yet it would lead to Goldilocks &#8211; a remarkable change  in the nature of the whole world &#8211; would miraculously emerge from the  disinflationary environment.</p>
<p>The discussion that follows begins with a few generalities about when and why  old environments fade away and begin to yield to new environments. We analyzed  this matter some time ago, but recent events provide a better perspective to our  line of argument. We go on to explore how much of the old environment has  disappeared, which then leads us to some speculation about how the new régime is  likely to develop.</p>
<h3>The dynamic process: Familiar facts in a new setting</h3>
<p>Economic environments do not have a specified life cycle, like the business  cycle. As I have argued elsewhere, economic régimes tend to persist as long as  people are still trying to figure out what is actually going on. This effort  strengthens the underlying characteristics of the environment and extends its  life expectancy. Change, therefore, is unlikely until people finally arrive at  the belief they understand what it is all about. Such a process has no definable  rhythm. The arrival of understanding could come sooner or later, depending on  the circumstances. Furthermore, this process applies to all environments, both  prosperous and depressed, to the 1920s as well as to the 1930s, to the years  from 1949 to 1969 as well as to the devastating decade that followed.</p>
<p>The 1920s were doomed at the moment when the New Era became a common phrase  and Irving Fisher explained that prosperity would last forever. The Great  Depression continued until unremitting deflation and waves of bank failures  convinced a new administration that the tie to gold at $20.67 an ounce was  stifling the economy. In addition, a total reversal of tax-raising fiscal policy  and restrictive monetary policy was both essential and urgent. The postwar  prosperity of 1949-1969 lasted for over twenty years because it was grounded in  doubt as everybody kept waiting for an inflation that failed to show up.  Inflation remained low, to general surprise, even though output growth was high.  Once people got the idea that high output would not automatically cause  inflation, the sense grew that now nothing could go wrong &#8211; and so we entered  another régime marked by the aggressiveness of monetary policy and war finance  in the 1970s. The resulting inflation would rage for ten years before  people recognized that a profound transformation of the conduct and targets of  monetary policy was essential. The outcome, as mentioned above, was the  transition decade of declining inflation in the 1980s, leading in turn to  Goldilocks after about 1989.</p>
<p>The Goldilocks environment was so benign it appeared to be a long sequence of  happy surprises. Goldilocks was aptly named: low volatility in capital  markets and in the real economy, low inflation, central banks in firm control, a  healthy appetite for risk-taking in the business world that led to revolutionary  technological change, the transformation of the &#8220;emerging&#8221; economies into  &#8220;developing&#8221; economies, and the resulting boom in globalization.</p>
<p>After the bursting of the dot.com bubble in 2000, the business sector of the  real economy resisted the fever for devil-may-care risk-taking that ultimately  infused the financial markets. As a result, Goldilocks had remarkable longevity.  Its death-knell would wait until the financial markets finally got the message  that high risks were not really high risks in a low-risk economy. Then the  fundamental stability and growth momentum of the global economic system created  a bulging appetite for risk-taking that led investors around the world to gorge  on anything that looked risky. A point came when any trigger would justify  ever-greater risk-taking. The actual trigger did not have to be housing, but  (with hindsight) we can see housing was a logical candidate. No one seemed to  doubt that home prices could ever stop rising. Debt had no ceilings.  Just to  make everything appear even better, housing requires financing, which was like  handing a delicious and multi-layered chocolate cake to the world of finance and  financial engineering. Professional investors learned how to clothe high risks  in a low-risk format for sale to the Great Unwashed, and to a goodly number of  the Washed as well. </p>
<p>In the aftermath of the fervor for risk-taking, Wall Street and the mortgage  banks have created many deep-seated problems for themselves. As an unhappy side  effect, the business sector, a relatively innocent observer, is going to have to  absorb much of the pain of curtailed consumer budgets and fewer exports to  foreign nations affected by the turmoil in the U. S.</p>
<h3>The aftermath: An introduction </h3>
<p>Human nature develops odd biases. In terms of the economy, memories of past  environments are more heavily weighted by the disasters than by the positive  achievements of the period. These disasters linger long in collective memories,  influencing public policy and investment practice for extended periods of  time.</p>
<p>Fear of the double-digit unemployment rates of the Great Depression dominated  economic policy from the end of the depression in 1933 to the late 1970s. As  late as 1978, with inflation raging around 8%, Congress enacted the  Humphrey-Hawkins Full Employment Act, providing for &#8220;the right of all Americans  able, willing, and seeking work to full opportunity for useful paid employment  at full rates of compensation.&#8221; Paul Volcker&#8217;s great achievement (and courage)  were in his conviction he would never defeat inflation as long as he had to  tread softly in limiting possible increases in unemployment. That constraint had  to change. Volcker saw no alternative if he was to win the battle in which he  had been put in command. As he carried out his campaign, the unemployment rate  soared from under 5% in 1979 to nearly 11% in 1982, but inflation dropped from a  peak of over 14% to less than 6% over the same period. </p>
<p>Today&#8217;s central bankers may make interesting observations about influencing  inflation expectations, but everyone knows they must ultimately have the courage  to see unemployment increase if their policies to contain inflation are to carry  credibility and actually influence expectations. The Fed is in an uncomfortable  position at this very moment, because the tradeoff has taken on an unusual  complexity, with the job market softening while lingering symptoms of inflation  are still visible.</p>
<p>As we now move on into the post-Goldilocks environment, which unhappy  memories are going to weigh heaviest? Worries about inflation are not about to  vanish, but new elements are going to join in. Clearly, everything that led up  to the credit crisis and the problems of home ownership will remain a central  focus of attention for a long time. </p>
<p>In addition, as we emphasized in our issue of August 15 of last year (&#8220;Memory  Banks and Economic Policy&#8221;), the increased income inequality generated by  Goldilocks has become a widespread popular concern, already making vibrations  among members of Congress and candidates for higher office. As Bill Gross  himself put it in strong words last August, &#8220;So when is enough, enough? Now is  the time, long overdue in fact, to admit that for the rich, for the mega-rich of  this country, that enough is never enough, and it is therefore incumbent upon  government to rectify today&#8217;s imbalances.&#8221; The rhetoric of the election campaign  is full of such talk. This concern will influence tax policy and spending policy  for a long time to come. </p>
<h3>The aftermath: The particulars</h3>
<p>The repercussions in the financial system are our main concern here. Most of  the current flood of analyses of the state of the credit markets concentrate on  the problems of the present. This kind of information is little help. We need to  develop a sense of how this situation is likely to evolve <i>over time</i>. To  accomplish that goal, our primary task is to discover where the roots of the new  régime are being planted.</p>
<p>We now set out our own views along these lines. We begin with a few  generalities. These generalities will lay the basis for the particulars that  follow.</p>
<p>Credit is always and everywhere a matter of trust. Where there is trust,  anything goes, as the recent proliferation of so many structured financial  instruments vividly demonstrates. When trust vanishes, the revival of the  buoyant credit creation of the past becomes extraordinarily difficult. But  without credit creation, economic growth and risk-taking are stifled. </p>
<p>Liquidity is also a matter of trust to some degree. But liquidity has another  feature that few people notice. <i>Liquidity is a function of laziness</i>. By  this I mean that liquidity is an inverse function of the amount of research  required to understand the character of a financial instrument. A dollar bill  requires no research. A bank draft requires less research than my personal  check. Commercial paper issued by JP Morgan requires less research than paper  issued by a bank in the boondocks. Buying shares of GE requires less research  than buying shares of a start-up high-tech company. A bond without an MBIA  (once-upon-a-time anyway) guarantee or a high S&#038;P/Moody&#8217;s rating requires  less research than a bond without a guarantee or lacking a set of letters  beginning with &#8220;A&#8221; from the rating agencies. The less research we are required  to perform, the more liquid the instrument &#8211; the more rapidly that instrument  can change hands and the lower the risk premium in its expected returns.</p>
<p>This emphasis on trust and liquidity in a well-functioning credit market  provides useful insights into what is happening.  Trust has vanished in many  areas where it was taken for granted just a few months back. And when the  ratings of S&#038;P and its competitors lost credibility, paper that had traded  on sight lost the liquidity it once enjoyed because now it involved far more  research than in the past. These words are just an elaborate way of explaining  why credit spreads were so narrow just nine months ago and so wide in today&#8217;s  markets. </p>
<p>This abrupt shift in viewpoints has caused snarls in many areas of the credit  markets. Over the longer-run, the most serious of these blockages is the  disruption in the process of securitization. Securitization works only in an  atmosphere of trust and where the paper involves a minimum of research.  <i>Without securitization, and without the lively derivatives markets that  developed around the securitization process, the entire credit system loses an  immense source of capacity, hindering deserving borrowers in search of financing   and, as a result, the pace of economic growth.</i></p>
<p>Until the system can restore trust and the related willingness to buy  instruments on the basis of limited research (or even no research), the credit  markets are going function below optimal levels. But restoring trust and  liquidity is no simple matter. Securitization broke the old personal  relationship between lender and borrower, greatly expanding the market for  credit in the process. The old-fashioned way &#8211; when lender and borrower were  essentially on a face-to-face relationship &#8211; was slower, more cumbersome, and,  most important, far more limited in terms of capacity. </p>
<p>In my days as a commercial banker, back in the late 1940s, the president of  my bank said to me, &#8220;Remember this. I much prefer the customer to be angry at  you because you denied him credit than for you to be angry at him because he  failed to repay when due.&#8221; That attitude sounds quaint today, but it was very  much in the spirit of a time where jokes about bankers&#8217; glass eyes were legion.  As the market for glass eyes revives &#8211; and it is reviving as we speak -new  credit creation will inevitably slow down. As Woody Brock recently emphasized,  &#8220;the combination of diminished bank capital and tighter lending standards could  prove fatal to credit creation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, it would be naïve to project this set of conditions into the indefinite  future. Trust will regenerate over time, and the burdens of research will  lighten. The pace of change in that direction, however, will be slow, a matter  of years rather than months. An entire structure has crumbled and has to be  rebuilt, brick-by-brick. Nor will that process necessarily be smooth. The impact  of unforeseen but inevitable credit problems will loom large, detouring and  delaying the pace and patterns of recovery on each occasion.</p>
<p>There could be bright spots as well. Our whole argument rests on the  proposition that the demand for credit is going to exceed the supply, which is  blocked by lack of trust and an increased burden of research. But a case where  supply fails to respond to an excess of demand is rare in our system. People in  finance have extraordinary energy for innovation in new products, new concepts,  new paths to ultimate objectives. For example, hedge funds and sovereign wealth  funds are already functioning as sources of credit, although a bump along the  way might turn them off as well. </p>
<p>These widespread and complex problems originated from an unanticipated  sequence of shocks involving banking institutions believed to be impervious to  losses in the billions and major impairments of equity capital. As we emphasized  above, new régimes are colored by the unhappy memories of the preceding régime,  and those memories linger on for extended periods of time. The plight of  Citicorp and Merrill Lynch reaching for massive help from foreign government  investment funds was an event nobody could have foreseen &#8211; but few will forget.  How the mighty had fallen!</p>
<h3>The critical ingredient in the state of distress</h3>
<p>The sequence of events that caused the economy to lose its forward momentum  over the course of 2007 was unique. This fact is central to our entire argument  here. The cause was not too much inventory, not overexpansion in industrial  capacity, not a sustained burst of inflation requiring a determined move to  tight money and higher rates at the Fed. </p>
<p><i>The root of today&#8217;s problems in the financial markets and in the economy  as a whole is the household sector.</i>  The point needs no elaboration, but its  significance cannot be minimized. As we have argued on more than one occasion,  the shrinkage in the personal savings rate is not the result of consumer  profligacy, as other commentators persist in describing it. Rather, the savings  rate has been suppressed by a slowdown in the growth of household incomes. The  shortfall between income and outlay has been met by borrowing, and in particular  by borrowing against the family real estate. Now the opportunity to borrow has  shrunk dramatically, an outcome that will profoundly change the household&#8217;s  spending power and spending patterns.  But the impact is not just on the  household. A slowdown in the growth of consumer spending has ominous  implications for the entire global economy &#8211; and, along the way, the U. S.  federal deficit, soon to be overburdened by spiraling benefit obligations. This  predicament is not a short-run matter, unless home prices abruptly reverse  themselves and head back into the stratosphere &#8211; which is hardly likely. </p>
<h3>The bottom line</h3>
<p>The central message of our analysis is not that the origin of today&#8217;s  difficulties is uniquely in the household sector or that the residue of these  difficulties has scrambled the whole credit structure in the financial markets.  Everybody knows about these troubles.</p>
<p>On the other hand, too few observes have noted how the consequences of these  developments are going to require an extended period of time before the  blockages they impose have been eliminated. But that is not all they have  missed. <i>This extended period of difficulty is going to bring about a new  economic régime, different in many aspects from the experience of most people  alive today.</i> Along the way, we will have to pass through a transition period  that harks back to an unfamiliar past in both the financial system and in the  household sector. </p>
<p>But this, too, shall pass. Yes, glassy-eyed bankers, prudent consumers, and a  reformulated globalization can keep a lid on economic activity around the world  for quite a while. What develops from that transition, however, should resemble  what took place over the course of the 1980s. Without anyone realizing it, the  errors of the past, drip by drip by drip, were buried and a new and better  system took their place.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080325/social_security.html?.v=9">AP</a> turns itself into Steno Sue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Government Benefit Programs in Trouble &#8211; Trustees Project Serious Financial Challenges for Social Security and Medicare: Trustees for the government&#8217;s two biggest benefit programs warned that Social Security and Medicare are facing &#8220;enormous challenges&#8221; with the threat to Medicare&#8217;s solvency far more severe. The trustees, issuing their once-a-year analysis, said the resources in the Social Security trust fund will be depleted by 2041.</p></blockquote>
<p>When I first read this, I thought – what a load of crap.  OK, I should back up from the profanity and explain what I mean.  Let me do this with a personal analogy.  As my kids were growing up, I saved a lot to fund their college education.  Over the past five years, I’ve paid a lot to pay for their college education so my bank account reserves did decline over the past five years.  But at no point was I not able to buy groceries.  Why?  Because I still have a steady stream of income.  Maybe I should just turn this microphone over to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=03&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=bush_appointees_use_trustee_po">Dean Baker</a> for more:</p>
<blockquote><p>There was nothing in these reports suggesting any qualitative deterioration in the financial state of these programs compared to their situation last year. The trustees claim, reported in this article, &#8220;that financial pressures will begin much sooner when the programs begin paying out more in benefits each year than they collect in payroll taxes&#8221; is simply a lie.  Under the law, both programs have distinct streams of funding in the form of a dedicated payroll tax. They have accumulated a large surplus from this tax which is available to be used to cover projected shortfalls in the decades ahead (Medicare already faces a shortfall). The fact that the expenses exceed revenue for a specific year makes no difference whatsoever for either program, as long as it has money in the trust fund to cover this shortfall.  President Bush&#8217;s trustees are either ignorant of the laws governing the operation of Social Security and Medicare or they deliberately misled the public, presumably to gain support for cutting these programs. Either way, the inaccuracy of their assertions is extremely newsworthy.</p></blockquote>
<p>But AP’s Martin Crutsinger does not challenge the inaccuracy of the Administration’s claim.  Rather he just reports them as if they were true.</p>
<p>In the meantime, check out <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/look-and-feel-15-years-younger">Paul Krugman</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>the difference between projected outlays and projected revenues over the next 75 years. This is the thing that’s supposed to get steadily worse as time goes by, as the 75-year window contains ever fewer years in which the baby boomers are in the work force, paying payroll taxes, and ever more years when the boomers are out of the work force and collecting benefits.  In fact, however, the actuarial balance has been improving rather than worsening. It’s now better than it’s been since 1993. What this tells us is that projections made in the mid-to-late 1990s were, in the light of subsequent revisions, way too pessimistic. Moral: Social Security’s financial problem is relatively minor. It doesn’t deserve the emphasis it receives from most pundits.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: Tom Maguire leaves the following canard as a comment:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, as I diligently saved for the college fund my wife spent all of it, and more, on nice clothes and fancy vacations, so in fact, our net family &#8220;savings&#8221; never existed and we have had to take out a second mortgage on the house. Now, however, I am actually writing the checks to cover college tuition, so either my wife will have to cut back elsewhere, or we will need to apply for a third round of financing on our home.</p></blockquote>
<p>My reply:</p>
<blockquote><p>Tom &#8220;Just One Minute&#8221; Maguire used one of my analogies. But Tom missed a crucial element. I&#8217;m divorced from my ex-wife. And she did try this stunt with a credit card she took out in my name. Guess what Tom? The credit card company realized that they never could bill me for her fraud.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tom?  Your analogy really is old and has been demolished many times.  Why one would  bother with this old canard is beyond me.</p>

Consider &#8211; if you want to serve in a combat zone, you would go ahead and sign up for the regular Army, as it increases your likelihood of a combat zone posting.  On the other hand, if you specifically do not want to end up in a combat zone, well, the Army Reserve or the National Guard is not the right place for you either.

                                <p>Tanta at <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">CR</a>takes a different tack on BS and Stampf at Wells Fargo:</p>
<blockquote><p>Yves at naked capitalism had a <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/03/bear-did-fed-and-treasury-get-too.html">good post</a> yesterday on the infamous Bear Stearns <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/03/jpmorgan-offers-10-per-share-for-bear.html">Ten Buck Rechuck</a>, that I think needs repeating:</p>
<p>According to Sorkin, the $2 price for Bear was the Fed&#8217;s and Treasury&#8217;s idea; JP Morgan was prepared to pay more, but they nixed the idea, saying they did not like the &#8220;optics&#8221; of the deal. The implication is that the officials overstepped their bounds. That is a pretty outrageous spin when the government is putting up taxpayer money. Had it been an option, the Fed should have nationalized Bear. It was going to declare bankruptcy Monday if there was no deal; its shareholders would have been wiped out. Why am I so confident of this view? If bondholders, as rumored, were buying shares to make sure the JPM deal went through (and thus would take losses on their stock purchases when the deal closed), that meant that they thought their bonds were worth well under 100 cents on the dollar in a bankruptcy. Shareholders are subordinate to bondholders, so equity owners would have gotten zilch.I can think of a host of reasons, however, why the Fed did not go the nationalization route, the biggest being that it lacked clear authority (it couldn&#8217;t declare Bear to be insolvent, as it could a member bank). And letting Bear fail (and having accounts frozen) was what the Fed was trying to avoid, so letting it fail and then seizing control (even assuming it could do that) was never an option. No doubt, the central bank also did not want to assume administrative control of an entity that it had never regulated (ie, its supervisors had never kicked its tires) that dealt actively in markets in which the Fed has little expertise. Even in an orderly liquidation scenario, that it a lot to take on.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/25/business/25sorkin.html?_r=1&#038;ref=business&#038;oref=slogin">Sorkin</a> nevertheless argues that the Fed did Bear a dirty because:</p>
<p>&#8230;..the night that Bear signed the original bid, the Fed opened what’s known as the discount window to companies like Goldman Sachs and Lehman Brothers — oh, yes, and to Bear, too. Except that the Fed didn’t tell Bear that it planned to open the window when it was signing its deal with JPMorgan.This verges on being revisionist history. First and most important, the discount window was opened to keep the panic about Bear from spreading to other firms, most notably Lehman. It almost certainly would not have happened then if Bear was not on the verge of imploding. Remember, a mere week and a day ago, there was pervasive fear that the wheels were about to come off the financial system, particularly if counterparties started getting leery of dealing with Lehman.Moreover, usage of the new discount window the first week was light due to worries about stigma. If Bear had gone and used it aggressively, it may well have reinforced rather than allayed fears about the trading firm&#8217;s health. If other firms continued to refuse to deal with Bear, its collapse was assured. There was a very real possibility that even if Bear had remained independent and used the window, its bankruptcy merely would have been delayed a day or two. And it would have been well nigh impossible to put together a three party takeover deal between the close of business in New York and market opening in Asia on a weekday.But the most appalling aspect of Sorkin&#8217;s account: he acts as if Bear had the right to be informed of the Fed&#8217;s plans. Sorkin seems to have forgotten the golden rule: he who has the gold makes the rules. The Fed had every right to be calling the shots. They were taking the biggest risk in this transaction. The notion that a firm about to fail is entitled to be treated as a being on an equal footing with its rescuers is absurd. And the fact that Sorkin (and presumably others on Wall Street) sympathize with this view says the industry badly needs to be leashed and collared.</p>
<p>This, frankly, is the reason why I am so incredibly appalled by <a href="http://sanfrancisco.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2008/03/24/daily1.html">this</a>:</p>
<p>Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf said the financial crisis is presenting the bank with more acquisition opportunities. &#8220;I would not be averse to a Fed-assisted transaction,&#8221; Stumpf said in a recent interview with the San Francisco Business Times. &#8220;Fixer-uppers don&#8217;t bother us.&#8221; The San Francisco banker said any deal would have to meet the company&#8217;s traditional acquisition targets and benefit the bank&#8217;s acquired customers.To even mention, in public, that one &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t be averse to a Fed-assisted transaction&#8221; is to hint that the acquisition targets you are looking at are in as dire straits as Bear Stearns. What is Stumpf trying to do, start a run on an insured bank? Or, well, the other option is that Stumpf doesn&#8217;t believe that Bear was such a mess&#8211;that, precisely, it is &#8220;on an equal footing with its rescuers.&#8221;Either way you slice it, the very fact that he could say such a thing in public tells you how far down the wrong road we&#8217;ve gone. I vote for the leash and collar, pronto.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>A while <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/huawei-3-com-year-rat-began-to-swallow.html">back</a>, I commented Bain Capital and Huawaei&#8217;s proposed purchase of 3-Com&#8217;s with Huawei taking a 16% share. The Committee on Foreign Investment has nixed the deal, citing security concerns.</p>
<p>Bain functions as an advisor to 3-Com, as does Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>Huawei&#8217;s lineage is a bit obscure. Although it &#8220;seems&#8221; to be an independent entity, we do know, at the very least, that it has close ties to the Chinese military and to the Chinese government. Those ties were close enough, apparently, to cause the Committee on Foreign Investment to act.<br />Be all that as it may, nothing can deter progress. Who or what wants to go east will go east.</p>
<p>3-Com is beginning to <a href="http://www.crn.com/networking/206905454">restructure</a>,<br />
<blockquote>by moving research and development and engineering functions to China and India</p></blockquote>
<p>3-Com needs to be a more profitable enterprise, as I am sure its advisors so counseled.</p>
<p>On a more mundane front, the next dental crown or bridge you use may be from <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS131479+09-Jan-2008+PRN20080109">China</a>. Be sure to check it for lead.</p>
<p>On another yet front, I hear that large signs may soon be offshored. I find that depressingly amusing. Signs, of course, encourage you to buy stuff. The fact that they may soon be made elsewhere and put up here&#8230;.well, the irony is too much even for me.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, I know&#8230;all in the name of progress.</p>
<p>But I ask you, if a country makes less and less, trades less and less, does it not have to rely more and more on credit? And credit is something we have been very good at creating and packaging.</p>
