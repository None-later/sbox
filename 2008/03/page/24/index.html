<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/kudlow-on-reagans-strong-dollar-policy.html">Cactus</a> brought to our attention the latest insanity from <a href="http://kudlow.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Zjk4MTcxZWViMjE1ZGI3OWEwY2Q0NmYwNzcwYjI3NWI=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> but I don’t think this is the main criticism:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Federal Reserve’s Major Currency Index for January 1981 was: 96.023. In January of 1989, it was 90.5499.</p></blockquote>
<p>As our first graph shows, the dollar did appreciate significantly from early 1981 through mid 1985.  What I find amazing is that Kudlow thinks this was a good idea then and it’s a good idea now:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Sen. John McCain wants to run as a candidate of change, and if he’s truly interested in distancing himself from President Bush, he should reverse the declining fortunes of the Bush wartime dollar. America’s prestige is on the line.  Right now the greenback is in virtual freefall. It’s a disorderly drop. As a result, U.S. inflation rates are rising across the board as the global commodity boom leaks into higher domestic inflation.  Inflation is the cruelest tax of all. It robs consumer and wage-earner purchasing power. It erodes business profits. It reduces the real worth of investor portfolios.  It’s also the single biggest cause of recession, and it may well be tipping the economy into negative territory. For the first time in a decade I’ve become genuinely worried about inflation. Over the last year and a half, inflation has climbed from 1.5 percent to nearly 4.5 percent, and in the past three to four months it has trended sharply higher.  But there’s another side of the dollar story that’s equally important. The falling U.S. greenback has become a symbol of American decline. Folks are making fun of the dollar. Our enemies around the world are pointing to the unreliable dollar as evidence of American weakness. It’s as though the administration’s neglect of the dollar is “peso-izing” or “Latin-Americanizing” the greenback &#8230; For patriotic reasons alone it is time to reverse the decline of the dollar. A strong dollar should be emblematic of a strong America and a strong defense.</p></blockquote>
<p>Prestige?  Patriotism?  I guess if one is as clueless about economics as Lawrence Kudlow appears to be, then maybe all one has is prestige and patriotism as excuses for a really bad policy prescription.  Kudlow’s line about inflation being the cause of recessions is idiotic.  Now it is a lack of aggregate demand.  </p>
<p>Kudlow is advocating contractionary monetary policy, which will have two adverse effects on aggregate demand.  One is to drive up real interest rates which will discourage both business and residential investment demand.  But the main on point transmission channel is the appreciation of the dollar that Kudlow wants, which would lower net export demand.  Let me address this by doing two things.  First – I ask you to listen to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=03&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=trade_and_the_dollar_what_is_s">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>USA Today ran a  piece today discussing trade policy in the context of lost manufacturing jobs in Ohio. It treats the loss of these jobs as a mystery, with some experts saying that trade played a role and others denying it. More importantly, the piece never discusses the high dollar, which is the most important reason that the United States has lost jobs through trade … The other huge flaw in this article is the failure to mention the value of the dollar. The dollar rose by close to 30 percent against the currencies of our trading partners in the late nineties. This was the main cause of the explosion in our trade deficit.   If the dollar rises by 30 percent it has approximately the same impact on trade as imposing a 30 percent tariff on all goods exported from the United States and providing a 30 percent subsidy for all goods imported from the country. It is virtually inconceivable that the United States will be able to reduce its trade deficit to a sustainable level unless the dollar falls considerably further against the currencies of our trading partners.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean is very critical of the strong dollar policies from the 1990’s onwards as he realizes that a strong dollar lowers net exports, which is one component of aggregate demand.  But Kudlow was praising the strong dollar policies of the early 1980’s.  So our second graph shows real exports (blue line) and real imports (real line – all figures in 2000$) from 1981 to 1985.  Notice that real exports failed to grow during this period while real imports grew after we recovered from the 1982 recession.  The dollar appreciation and its negative impact on net export demand in fact was one of the reasons why the 1982 recession was so deep. </p>
<p>Now Cactus is right – the dollar did devalue during Reagan’s second term.  Some of us believe that was a good thing as it temporarily reversed the deterioration of the current account deficit.  I would hope policy makers realize that what Kudlow is advocating would not only reduce aggregate demand making the recession worse but would also have negative consequences for the current account.  But maybe John McCain will be stupid enough to think this idiocy from Kudlow makes sense.</p>
<p>Let me close by saying we may indeed be facing some Latin-Americanizing of the dollar but here the problem is not with the proper use of monetary policy to moderate business cycles.  The problem lies in the fiscal fiasco created by Bush’s tax cuts – both of which Kudlow supports.  If the next President is smart, he or she will abandon the policies recommended by the likes of Kudlow.  But then John McCain doesn’t seem to get fiscal policy either.</p>

                                <p>Reader TinMan sends a rant on&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>the “Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005” and how it relates to what drug companies would consider “progress” – i.e. taking prescription drugs into the OTC arena.</p>
<p>My current bout of angst is due to my requirement (need, addiction?) of Zyrtec with a decongestant (Zyrtec-D). Now Zyrtec has recently gone OTC, thank goodness for the FDA, and that puts me into a bind when it comes to prescription meds in that this particular compound is now no longer covered and all the requisite ‘recordkeeping’ required for processing prescription paperwork/insurance filings.</p>
<p>Adding to the misery is the fact that the decongestant formulation contains pseudoephedrine (PSE) which, as we ALL know is the main precursor to methamphetamine, is now OTC but “behind the counter”.</p>
<p>In reading through this act, which by-the-by was (from what I could tell) tacked on to the renewal of the Patriot Act (gack!), the federal requirements/limitations on the manufacture and sale of PSE-containing products dictates not only how retailers are allowed to sell but including additional record keeping requirements in addition to stipulating how the controlled chemical’s are packaged by the manufacturers!</p>
<p>What’s turned from a simple, less than 5 minute process of “I’m here to pick up my prescription for Fetch”, swipe my credit card, sign their ‘prescription receipt’ logbook, and I’m gone to this:</p>
<blockquote><p>Me: I need 3 boxes of 24-count Zrytec-D (using the monthly limit of 9 grams in a single visit; 120mg/pill, 24 pills/box).</p>
<p>Pharmacy Tech (PT): I can only sell you 2.  I don’t make the laws sir. (note – this has put a requirement on pharmacies to employ PTs now since they’re the lowest-authorized employee allowed to sell ‘controlled’ substances which PSE now is; oh, and there’s a daily limit of 3.6 grams regardless of the monthly limit)</p>
<p>Me: Fine, 2 boxes then.</p>
<p>PT: Can I see some ID (I hand her my passport – specifically don’t want/need my address there)</p>
<p>PT: Address?</p>
<p>Me: Let me do that (I write in my work address &#038; sign)</p>
<p>Me: Nothing like inconveniencing the people who really need the medication…</p>
<p>Pharmacist: That’s true…and you’re not the only one.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, I finally purchase my “OTC” meds to the tune of $47.98 (for 48 pills!!!!) and go to take one when I get to work: two boxes, each with 24 INDIVIDUALLY WRAPPED PILLS!!!</p>
<p>What has this world come to!?</p>
<p>We go from purchasing a single bottle of prescription medication (60 pills) for a $30 co-pay (total cost around $90 based upon what “savings” I was being shown) with the bottle being recyclable all in less than 5 minutes.</p>
<p>To 2 paper boxes each stuffed with 24 individually plastic &#038; paper wrapped pills for nearly $50 that practically screams of the TSA performing pharmacy sales!</p>
<p>Not only excessively costly for the consumer (when compared to it being a covered med) but then the overall impact to the environment for packaging &#038; disposal of the packaging once used.</p>
<p>“Gotta slow down these tweakers in their labs ya know…”</p>
<p>All to combat an ‘epidemic’ that no amount of law enforcement seems capable of stopping.</p>
<p>I guess I’ve never been exposed to the epidemic (lived in Dallas/Fort Worth for the past 12 years, now in the NYC area) so I don’t necessarily know the ramifications of meth but still.  Square that with a family of 6 (4 children) who all happen to get sick at the same time and you’re left to wonder “Who gets to suffer tonight since the government wouldn’t let me purchase enough medications to soothe everyone…”</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>

                                <p>OPEC is not riding to the rescue. According to a NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/business/AP-OPEC-Meeting.html">piece</a>, OPEC is satisfied that the world has enough oil, even though the price of oil adjusted for inflation hit an all time high: $103.76 versus $38 in 1980 &#8220;at the height of the Iran hostage crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>OPEC apparently believes that the U.S. economic downturn will be enough to lessen the price of oil. We shall see. I wonder how much of a downturn we need? According the <a href="http://www.energybulletin.net/39169.html">Energy Bulletin</a>, China&#8217;s newly acquired taste for oil is part of what is escalating the price:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Double-digit demand growth in China is a fundamental driver of the oil price. The United States and China are locked into a spiraling mutual dependency in which the People&#8217;s Republic manufactures consumer goods and Americans buy them. China&#8217;s share of world oil consumption is now about 9% and rising yearly.</p></blockquote>
<p>As David Cohen, the writer of the Bulletin piece, so exquisitely points out, China is faced with a real dilemma:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Wen Jiabao continues the price freeze to tame inflation, he risks fuel shortages as subsidized demand spirals out of control. Supply insufficiencies force the Chinese to import more oil and refined products, which drives up world crude prices. Higher oil prices mean lower crack spreads for Chinese refiners who already operate at a loss.</p></blockquote>
<p>On another front, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/04/opinion/04herbert.html?hp">Bob Herbert</a> has an interesting piece about price of the Iraq war. According to Joe Stiglitz, the war that has no end already will cost us around $3 trillion.</p>
<p>Then Nouriel Roubini says that the subprime disaster may well be in excess of $1 trillion. And, all expect the FED to cut rates further, not that the cuts already have eased the plight of homeowners. In fact, quite the opposite: Rates went down; mortgage rates went up. Banks needed the cash and were quite eager to recoup their losses any way they could. As I pointed out in a prior piece, &#8220;The Latest Banking Scam: Which Dog to Kick,&#8221; banks are now sneakily increasing overdraft fees.</p>
<p>On yet another front, England finally had to nationalize Northern Rock&#8211;until it got its legs back. Then, of course, once the government sets its books aright, back into private hands it will go. Yes, you heard me. The plan is to turn it eventually back into private hands.</p>
<p>Some are asking for more transparency, more regulations. Dream on.</p>
<p>No OPEC cavalry riding to the rescue.</p>
<p>So here we are, between a rock and a hard place: Oil continuing its relentless rise. Inflation is on the prowl. And trillions are being sucked from the economy either through misadventure or greed.</p>
<p>After a while, I just have to ask: Who in hell is running this show? Anybody in charge?</p>

                                <p>Can anyone recommend a wireless router?  Anything other than a D-Link product?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m tired of D-Link.  I&#8217;ve owned two of them, and its always the same nonsense.  A power outage, or someone re-arranges the wires, and I have to spend 25 minutes getting the connection re-activated.  Its a matter of hit or miss pressing the same button over and over and over and over while trying to see if the browser finally comes up.  (I don&#8217;t need a wireless router myself &#8211; but the Ex-GF likes to have a wireless connection to her Mac.) Last night it got worse.  We had some electrical work done in the hovel.  I spent an hour trying to get the router up with no success.  This morning I&#8217;ve been trying and trying.  At this point I don&#8217;t care any more.  Or rather, I do.  I&#8217;m having very uncharitable thoughts about D-Link for wasting my time.  </p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re wondering why I don&#8217;t call customer service &#8211; I&#8217;ve called D-Link customer service in the past and have come to believe the primary gain to calling them is adding 30 minutes to the amount of time it takes to get the thing  operational again.  I don&#8217;t need those kinds of benefits.</p>
<p>I finally connected this computer directly to the modem, but keeping it that way is not an option.  I don&#8217;t want to waste any more time.  Can anyone suggest a router?  Anything other than D-Link?</p>

                                <p>In<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/yes-virginia-rich-are-different.html"> this post</a>, Bruno commented and posted <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html">this link </a>to reference this statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2005, the top 1 percent of tax returns paid 39.4 percent of all federal individual income taxes and earned 21.2 percent of adjusted gross income, both of which are significantly higher than 2004 when the top 1 percent earned 19 percent of AGI and paid 36.9 percent of federal individual income taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>I assume that the purpose of reporting the data in this way is to invoke a natural sense of fairness to people. That being that one&#8217;s share of B should reflect their share of A. That B became “significantly higher” suggests some unfairness. Oh for the humanity of it.</p>
<p>The report could have reported that the top 1%&#8217;s tax burden in dollars was 20% higher, however their share of income was 21.8% higher. Now is this fair? Is this fair of the report to have noted the rise of both income and taxes paid in a manor that makes the top1% look as if they are getting unfair treatment and not show that the bottom 99% &#8216;s income only went up 6.2% but their dollars paid in income taxes went up 7.9%?</p>
<p>How fair is this? All of it? 1980 to 2005 all? Adjusted incomes all?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out this report had a link to an exel file of their data. Perfect! As a dutiful AB&#8217;er I took it as my charge to see what that data was really showing. Turns out since 1980, the messing with the tax rates has had some strange effects. Fairness is missing in all of it, even the vaunted Clinton era.</p>
<p>Look at this chart. Notice how the income for the bottom 99% is continuously falling away from the total income. Of course, you can&#8217;t miss the top 1% line. Up, up and away (in my beautiful, my beautiful balloon&#8230;)</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/R81ZwzVNCoI/AAAAAAAAAG4/hdPd9jQ6KKE/s1600-h/Total+adj+income+1980+to+2005.JPG"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/R81ZwzVNCoI/AAAAAAAAAG4/hdPd9jQ6KKE/s400/Total+adj+income+1980+to+2005.JPG" border="0"></a>The next chart is of total taxes paid. Notice the similarity. The rising share of total income that becomes income taxes is certainly a function of one&#8217;s rising share of total income.

Look between 1991 and 2000 at the bottom 99%. Do you see that it is rising? This is a period that we are suppose to be considering a symbol of progressive taxation and yet income taxes paid as a percentage of income is rising for the bottom 99% while it is descending for the top 1%. The actual percentages for the 99%&#8217;ers start in 1992 at 10.9 and peaks in 2000 at 12.1%. Where as the top 1% go from 25.05% 1992 to 28.87% 1996 to 27.45 2000. </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Update, forgot these 2 paragraphs:</div>
<div><em>Is this what we are to consider progressive taxation? No it is not. The covers blown. We have not had a progressive tax adjustment since we started playing with the code with Reagan. And it hurt more knowing that it was decidedly unprogressive during a term when the president ran as a progressive. It hurts even more because Clinton&#8217;s term is being pointed to as a time to emulate. A rise of share of income to the top 1% of 6 points in 8 years and now we see that the bottom got buffaloed in the income tax department too. </em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div><em><br />The highest total of income collected as income taxes in this series of data was 1981 at 15.76%. Being that Reagan hadn&#8217;t started blowing the budget, this could reasonably be considered the amount of money we have to pay to keep the budget in good shape. (That is assuming all other taxes stay the same as 1981. They didn&#8217;t.) But NOOOOOOOOOOO. We see us paying less each year until 1990. Only 23.25% was paid to take care of our house that year. The top 1% paid 25.1% of the house needs out of 14% of the income. The rest of us paid 74.9% of the house needs out of 86% of the income. </em></div>
<div> </div>
<div>By 2000 we are paying 15.26% of our total income for the needs of the house. The top 1% is paying 37.4% of the need out of 20.8% of the income. The rest of us are paying 62.6 % of the needs out of 79.2% of the income. Ok, I guess there was some progressiveness here. </div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>But!</strong> In 1992 the income per capita for the top 1% was $152,743 and $11,055 for the rest. By 2000 it&#8217;s $343,357 and $15,999 respectively. Now I ask you, is this progressive? A 124.8% increase for the 1%&#8217;ers and only a 44.7% increase for the rest of us. Remember, this is during the Clinton years!</div>
<div>Since that time, the house has really been starving for attention. In 2005, the year the top is or is not getting screwed (I think the numbers show they are not) we collectively only paid 12.45% of our income to the house needs. We have never paid so little. Well, except for 2003 when we paid 11.9%. Which just happens to be somewhere between the 1999 and 2000 percentage for the share of income paid by the bottom 99%. Yes folks, currently we are trying to fund the house on the same percentage of income that only the bottom 99% use to pay. Or, put another way, we are funding a 304.2% (BEA table 3.1 1981 to 2005) increase in house needs on only a 234.3% increase in payments to the house while the total source has increased 319.2%. That&#8217;s 260.2% (awfully close to the house needs rise) for the bottom 99 and 970.3% for the poor souls burdened with 39% of the house needs. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Let me be blunt: This all sucks. Just plain sick and tired of having my head played sucks.</div>

<blockquote><p><a href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/2008/03/disingenuous-begging-by-paulson.html">Morality vs. Business Decisions</a></p>
<p>But this is not about morality at all. This is about business decisions. See Moral Obligations Of Walking Away and The Business of Walking Away for more on the morality vs. business decisions.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, banks made business decisions to lend money to people to buy houses that banks knew people could not afford. Banks also made business decisions to lend with no money down. Banks knew there were risk to these strategies but they took the risks anyway.Those were bad business decision for banks. Banks, not taxpayers should pay the price.</p>
<p>Paulson is now begging people to do something that may not be in their best interest to do. My recommendation is simple. If it benefits you to walk away, then walk away.</p>
<p>Note too that walking away is not one sided. Banks and businesses &#8220;walk away&#8221; all the time when it suits their best interest. Deals are being broken as I type and banks are paying breakup fees. See Businesses Advised To Walk Away for more on this topic.</p>
<p>The &#8220;breakup fee&#8221; for homeowners walking away is a bad mark on their credit report and loss of their down payment. In many cases the down payment was zero. Banks have only themselves to blame for setting the breakup fee too low.</p>
<p>Bubbles, greed, and bailouts, not walking away, are the real moral hazards. And if enough people do walk away (forced or unforced), banks will be more careful about who they lend to next time and what the breakup fees (down payments) need to be. If and when banks (and the Fed) are more careful, fewer bubbles will get blown, and the better off we all will be.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Every few hours throughout the day, I take a short break.  Sometimes I need some humor, and I head to the National Review.  Here&#8217;s <a href="http://kudlow.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Zjk4MTcxZWViMjE1ZGI3OWEwY2Q0NmYwNzcwYjI3NWI=">Kudlow</a> contributing a chuckle:</p>
<blockquote><p>Right now the greenback is in virtual freefall. It’s a disorderly drop.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Something must be done to reverse this trend, and McCain is in a good spot to do it. Remember, McCain was a foot soldier in the Reagan revolution. Borrowing a page from the Gipper — who always said a great nation has a strong currency — he should argue on the campaign trail for a dollar surge.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder if it will ever occur to Kudlow or someone, anyone, on the right to check some data about St. Ronald the Reagan, the ultimate incarnation Mr. &#8220;Say One Thing and Do Another.&#8221; Case in point:  The <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h10/summary/indexn_m.txt">Federal Reserve&#8217;s Major Currencies Dollar Index</a> for January 1981 was: 96.023.  In January of 1989, it was 90.5499.  Sure, that wasn&#8217;t the collapse we&#8217;ve enjoyed during the presidency of Bush the Incoherent (Jan 2001:  103.5074, Feb 2008:  72.5747) but it takes a full load of delusion to be simultaneously in favor of a strong dollar and Reagan&#8217;s dollar policy.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you have a servicer who is doing a lot of repayment plans, and the MBA data suggests we have that, then you&#8217;re going to see a lot of delinquency statuses going &#8220;in reverse,&#8221; and you&#8217;re also going to see, unfortunately, a lot of loans going from 30-days or 60-days down straight to FC, because the MBA data tells us that 29% of all FCs in the third quarter of 2007 happened after a repayment plan failed. That nasty fact may tell us something about the wisdom or practicality of these repayment plans. It may tell us that borrower financial distress just keeps increasing. It may tell us that borrowers get demoralized long before they&#8217;re done with the repayment plan and just give up. It may tell us that some borrowers entered the repayment plan in less than complete good faith. We&#8217;d need more evidence to decide that. But the last thing it tells us is that borrowers are &#8220;just walking away&#8221; with no attempt to save their homes.</p>
<p>Reading and analyzing real-time remittance reports is a complicated matter that can lead you down the wrong path if you aren&#8217;t well-versed in how it all works. I fault no one, certainly not Mish, for not being an expert in remittance analysis. It is only recently that this became something non-experts were interested in, after all. (For most of my years in this business I&#8217;d have called you a liar if you&#8217;d said the day would come when huge numbers of civilians would avidly read websites that post long treatises on boring technical mortgage-related crap when they were not forced to. I&#8217;d have been wrong.)</p></blockquote>
