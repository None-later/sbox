<p>If you trade for promises, then accounting in the short run does not matter.  If you take 5 of the real marbles and get a bike, that is real&#8230;5 out of the 40 makes sense until margin calls.</p>
<p>Most of us think we actually own the houses we live in.  Some of us do if we pay our taxes.  Most of us think that when we have cash in our pockets, even borrowed, we are moneyed. I think the parents remained unaware of the trades because they were out charging fine dinner and wine meals, or considered it cute, or wonderfully precocious, and not affecting the real economy. Partly true, but nobody is happy.</p>

                                <p>While I was away, Tyler Cowen <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/03/bailouts.html">wrote something with which I strongly disagree</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you&#8217;re a critic of bailouts, you can&#8217;t have it both ways.  If the Fed or Treasury is guaranteeing loans, yes that does put taxpayer dollars on the line.  But if you think the system can hold up, as do most bailout critics, those guarantees are unlikely to cost very much.  The Fed or Treasury may even turn a profit.  If you think the system cannot hold up, the bailout is probably necessary even if costly.  So you can&#8217;t claim: &#8220;The bailout isn&#8217;t needed&#8221; and also &#8220;The bailout will burden taxpayers.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Uh, no.  I think the bailouts (of both homeowners and banks) are a bad mistake despite, or rather, in fact, because I think the system cannot hold up.  The system revolves around the sale of squirrel carcasses.  The folks involved in the system made a lot of money selling squirrel carcasses and calling them fillet mignon.  Now that we all know what the &#8220;market&#8221; was about, the best thing that can happen is for it to be severed as quickly and efficiently as possible from the rest of the economy, which means, to make all of those who are involved pay the price. </p>
<p>But Cowen is right about one thing, though &#8211; it is possible (though I wonder how likely) that the Fed or the Treasury may turn a profit.  But if it does so, its by making the last greater fools, and the greater fool theory tells us someone is always a last greater fool, pay. Not all the folks who were involved are still there &#8211; when the problems began, they found someone else, a bit less informed, a bit less sophisticated, to buy their share of the bag.  Many of those greater fools are homeowners, many are shareholders or employees of some of the big banks.  In some cases, the big perps themselves may take a hit.  But not in all.  </p>
<p>Regardless, I can&#8217;t see any excuse for a bailout at this point, and if there is a bailout, I can&#8217;t see any excuse for one that doesn&#8217;t provide the taxpayer with the potential for a lot of upside (i.e., nationalization).</p>

<p>David Leonhardt <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/business/19leonhardt.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;pagewanted=all&#038;oref=slogin">notes</a> that it&#8217;s pretty hard to explain what&#8217;s going on in the financial world these days (ht Felix). Here&#8217;s how I&#8217;d tell the tale to a child:</p>
<p>Alice, Bob, and Sue have ten marbles between them. Whenever one kid wants another kid to take over a chore, she promises a marble in exchange. Alice doesn&#8217;t like setting the table, so she promises Bob a marble if he will do it for her. Bob hates mowing the lawn, but Sue will do it for a marble. Sue doesn&#8217;t like broccoli, but if she says pretty please and promises a marble, Bob will eat it off her plate when Mom isn&#8217;t looking.</p>
<p>One day, the kids get together to brag about all the marbles they soon will have. It turns out that, between them, they are promised 40 marbles! Now that is pretty exciting. They&#8217;ve each promised to give away some marbles too, but they don&#8217;t think about that, they can keep their promises later, after they&#8217;ve had time to play with what&#8217;s coming. For now, each is eager to hold all the marbles they&#8217;ve been promised in their own hands, and to show off their collections to friends.</p>
<p>But then Alice, who is smart and foolish all at the same time, points out a curious fact. There are only 10 marbles! Sue says, &#8220;That cannot be. I have earned 20 marbles, and I have only promised to give away three! There must be 17 just for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>But there are still only 10 marbles.</p>
<p>Suddenly, when Bob doesn&#8217;t want to mow the lawn, no one will do it for him, even if he promises two marbles for the job. No one will eat Sue&#8217;s broccoli for her, even though everyone knows she is promised the most marbles of anyone, because no one believes she will ever see those 17 marbles she is always going on about. In fact, dinnertime is mayhem. Spoons are placed where forks should be, and saucers used for dinner plates, because Alice really is hopeless in the kitchen. Mom is cross. Dad is cross. Everyone is cross. &#8220;But you promised,&#8221; is heard over and over among the children, amidst lots of stomping and fighting. Until recently, theirs was such a happy home, but now the lawn is overgrown, broccoli rots on mismatched saucers, and no one trusts anyone at all. It&#8217;s all a bit mysterious to Dad, who points out that nothing has changed, really, so why on Earth is&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>I love parables.  The rest is at the Interfluidity.</p>

                                <p>This is a post about 1) medical tourism and 2) importing pharmaceuticals from Canada.</p>
<p>I heard something that piqued my interest the other day, so I did eight seconds worth of searching on-line and found <a href="http://www.imakenews.com/iln/e_article001011951.cfm">this</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While no one expects the Federal government to embrace medical tourism for Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement purposes, private insurance companies are beginning to develop, and have already developed, plans that include a medical tourism component.</p></blockquote>
<p>The article goes on, discussing some of the legal issues associated with medical tourism paid for by private insurance companies.  Its interesting, but I want to take this in a different direction:   consider the brouhaha about importing pharmaceuticals from Canada.  Pharmaceutical companies sell the same drugs in Canada (and pretty much else) for less &#8211; a lot less.  Thus, its cheaper to buy a given drug from Canada and ship it back to the US than it is to buy it in the US, even if it was designed and manufactured in the US.  But the argument made by the insurance companies and many folks on the right is that this would stifle innovation, because if you pay pharmaceutical companies only what they are willing to charge Canadians, they won&#8217;t develop new drugs.  </p>
<p>But this argument should apply to medical tourism, which in effect sets a minimum baseline price on all sorts of procedures, including exotic ones like heart surgery and brain surgery.  (Horror of horrors, it also means that while abroad, the patient will be consuming pharmaceuticals sold at much lower costs than in the US market!)  To be consistent, those who oppose allowing consumers the option of importing pharmaceuticals from Canada should also be opposed to allowing people to travel abroad for surgery.</p>

<p>The US plays the &#8216;game of houses&#8217; with determination, some skill, and lots of resources as every power has.  We as an electorate do like to believe we are also enlightening and freeing others.  Sometimes we actually do.</p>
<p>The US trains and funds extremists to send into Iran.  But I also remember other places closer to home.  And it was not to free people.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is long past time that one important piece of fantastical rubbish be finally sent on its way: this is the idea that Islamists maintain some kind of fastidious ethnic and theological separatism when it comes to who they&#8217;re willing to work with on killing people.&#8221; &#8211; Noah Pollak, July 16, 2007</p></blockquote>
<p>True or not in the aggregate?  True or not in particular to certain entities?<br />Paskistan and Iranian intelligence work together on some things.  Kashmir rebels sometimes vet candidates that go to Pakistan.  Saudi Arabia helps first the part of the royal family in charge, and many others.  Syria, Hizbullah, Hamas can live together sometimes.</p>
<p>So what is the question our answers want to fit?  </p>
<p>Update:  I am asking a question, links required, and am not sneaking in a hidden answer.  If I wanted to say McCain was right, I would.  What do you know about terrists?</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Today, we hear that the government may well have to nationalize the mortgages as well as formally nationalize Fannie and Freddie. So says <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/blog/roubini/250488">Nouriel Roubini</a> and <a href="http://www.zimbio.com/pilot?SP=1&#038;ZURL=%2FCongressman%2BBarney%2BFrank%2Frolls%2F5%3FSort%3Drank&#038;URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.house.gov%2Ffrank%2F">Barney Franks</a>.</p>
<p>While their recommendations may differ in details, both see the government as the savior of last resort.</p>
<p>If they are correct in their assessment of the gravity of the problem, i.e., that the so-called &#8220;shadow system of banking&#8221; is about to implode, resulting in the worst crisis since the Great Depression, then we may well need to rethink our &#8220;laissez-faire&#8221; system of capitalism.  Certainly our financial system needs more oversight.</p>
<p>Health care is in deep trouble. Municipal bonds are failing at auction. Higher education is becoming less and less affordable. The mega-rich get richer; the rest of us, struggle. The list goes on and on.  Privatization sans regulations seem to be a recipe for disaster.</p>
<p>I was struck with one comment on the Roubini post:</p>
<blockquote><p>When will you guys learn that the regulatory welfare state is designed to save capitalism from its own excesses, not destroy it?<br />[Peter Principle] </p></blockquote>
<p>Such an apt nickname for such a provocative comment. Has U.S. capitalism finally reached its level of true incompetence?</p>
<p>While many on this blog will shudder at such a conclusion and such a solution, events may so unfold that what we have been taught to believe as unthinkable may well be the only answer.<br />

<blockquote><p>And given that global wheat prices are so high, it is tempting for farmers to borrow more in their hope that their gamble pays off with a bumper harvest.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really is back to the bank manager,&#8221; says George, explaining how that conversation will now go: &#8220;&#8216;OK, this is THE crop. Everyone is talking it up. Let&#8217;s have a go at it.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s borrowed money that&#8217;s doing it. And if it doesn&#8217;t come off and there are too many more [poor years], then you have to sell the farm.&#8221;</p>
<p>But who is going to buy the farms?</p>
<p>&#8220;There are already two or three farms in the district which are up for sale and should have been sold. But people just don&#8217;t have the money to buy them,&#8221; explains George.</p>
<p>With global wheat prices at record highs, one bumper crop would alleviate much of the financial burden and help many local farmers pay off their debts.</p>
<p>But their hopes have been dashed before.</p>
<p>Last year saw one of the best starts to a growing season for years, but dry weather in recent weeks has forced the Australian government to slash its crop forecasts by 30%.</p></blockquote>
<p>It struck me that unlimited credit expansion has an appeal because it will be successful for awhile, even a few years for the players, but HAS TO fail in any one year when market forces somehow come together to restrict the three laws of unlimited credit expasion Old Vet proposed.</p>
<p>Farmers gamble also, but the market has more limits and is not as elastic. But farmers also fail sometimes. There is just no glamor, and the pizza you order is pretty mundane looking&#8230;unless you can&#8217;t get one.</p>
<p>If you are going to invest, take a look at <a href="http://www.localharvest.org/csa/">CommunitySupported Agriculture</a> (CSA&#8217;s) to take on a portion of the risk to feed your family. It might even be healthier for you. There are two locally I know of, but you need to look around in your own locality.</p>
<p>And why is it farmers have no status?</p>

<p>Trying to get beyond today’s headlines, and the moves and countermoves in today’s markets, is difficult. However the future beckons, and it’s looking a lot more “deflationary” than “inflationary” which is the exact reason the Fed is throwing around the power of the “lender of last resort.” Don’t want a Depression, do we?</p>
<p>The great de-leveraging of 2008 continues, in which credit market expansion reverses due to excessive credit extended to a myriad of parties who now have trouble paying. One aspect that is now rising to prominence in the banking and non-banking financial world are financial derivatives and counterparty risks borne between parties like banks, hedge funds, brokers, and securities dealers.</p>
<p>In 1996 the US banking system hardly knew derivative financial instruments, but these have proliferated through the following decade to the present day. Think of “vanilla extract” or condensed essence of the vanilla bean. Vanilla extract is the kitchen equivalent of financial debt derivatives to their underlying financial products such as mortgage debt, automobile debt, credit card debt, corporate bonds, interest rate contracts, foreign exchange contracts, over the counter or listed contracts of various kinds. Most derivatives are not traded in public markets but sold in private deals, which makes them hard to track and to evaluate.</p>
<p>Notional values are not actual cash values. The premise of derivatives transactions is that a small amount of real cash can be used to gain exposure to a large amount of notional dollars. Hence the leverage. The movement in the notional values ultimately determines the profit or loss of the underlying derivative contract. Therefore the cash risk exposure of the banks listed below indicate RELATIVE rather than absolute cash exposure.</p>
<p><strong>Trillion $ of notional derivative exposure</strong></p>
<p>JP Morgan        $91.7<br />Citicorp             $34.0<br />BofA                  $32.1<br />Bear Stearns    $13.4<br />Morgan Stanley $7.1<br />Wachovia          $5.2<br />Merrill              $4.6<br />HSBC                $4.4<br />Goldman          $2.0<br />Wells                 $1.0<br />Bank Of NY     $1.0<br />Lehman           $0.7<br />(10-K data)</p>
<p>In the US banking system, exposure to financial derivatives proliferated but was then reduced by “laying off” or sharing risk with counter parties. It is called “bilateral netting.” The rough amount of derivatives laid off to counterparties rose from 45% of derivatives in 1996 to 85% in 2007. Thus counter party risk is the issue in the mysterious world of derivatives. How solid are your counterparties?</p>
<p>Bilateral netting is essentially the degree or magnitude of financial risk exposure laid off to counter parties. Counter parties such as other banks, perhaps a hedge fund or three, an insurance company, and even a broker such as Bear Stearns. Wait a minute, Bear Stearns? One and the same.</p>
<p>The financial derivatives world is held together by <strong>three critical assumptions:</strong></p>
<p>1. Always available liquidity (meaning plenty of cash in the hands of buyers),</p>
<p>2. 100% solvency of counter parties (meaning capacity to pay debts), and</p>
<p>3. A continuous market (no freezes, breaks, or discontinuities please)</p>
<p>Oops. All three of these assumptions have been violated recently in one degree or another, and the Federal Reserve Bank has stepped in.</p>
<p>Up until now we have seen many a &#8220;temporary&#8221; liquidity or asset swap action on the part of the Fed. Next up in this ongoing chain of events should indeed be some type of Fed sponsored monetization (the true printing of money, so to speak, which really has not yet occurred in its most pure form and in magnitude). As of today, the money printing sequence has not yet blossomed in full form as apparently the Fed is scared of nearer term dollar and global commodity price consequences. That may be changing if “runs” on financial institutions continue, as they must in order for the great Credit Cycle to turn towards less leverage.</p>
<p>Consequences ahead? Maybe a bailout fund, or using Fannie and Freddie as bailout funds, or the Fed simply buying crappy financial derivatives and “products.” Replacing them with cash to insolvent institutions, something well beyond merely increasing liquidity (cash) in the system. It’s what markets really want, Big Daddy to come in and take away their cares, and tell them their sins of greed and extravagance will be lifted away.</p>
<p>I really don’t know what that means for stocks, the US dollar, for prices of anything we buy, or anything we sell. But I’m sure that it will become clear if the Fed takes the next step, which is a doozy.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://obsidianwings.blogs.com/obsidian_wings/2008/03/clueless.html">Clueless</a> is how Hilzoy terms the latest from John McCain.  The <a href="http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2008/03/18/a_mccain_gaffe_in_jordan.html">Washington Post</a> reports:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sen. John McCain, traveling in the Middle East to promote his foreign policy expertise, misidentified in remarks Tuesday which broad category of Iraqi extremists are allegedly receiving support from Iran. He said several times that Iran, a predominately Shiite country, was supplying the mostly Sunni militant group, al-Qaeda. In fact, officials have said they believe Iran is helping Shiite extremists in Iraq.  Speaking to reporters in Amman, the Jordanian capital, McCain said he and two Senate colleagues traveling with him continue to be concerned about Iranian operatives &#8220;taking al-Qaeda into Iran, training them and sending them back.&#8221; Pressed to elaborate, McCain said it was &#8220;common knowledge and has been reported in the media that al-Qaeda is going back into Iran and receiving training and are coming back into Iraq from Iran, that&#8217;s well known. And it&#8217;s unfortunate.&#8221; A few moments later, Sen. Joseph Lieberman, standing just behind McCain, stepped forward and whispered in the presidential candidate&#8217;s ear. McCain then said: &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, the Iranians are training extremists, not al-Qaeda.&#8221; The mistake threatened to undermine McCain&#8217;s argument that his decades of foreign policy experience make him the natural choice to lead a country at war with terrorists. In recent days, McCain has repeatedly said his intimate knowledge of foreign policy make him the best equipped to answer a phone ringing in the White House late at night.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hilzoy notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s important to be clear about exactly how clueless this is. It&#8217;s like saying that some neo-confederate group is secretly funneling money to Louis Farrakhan, and then having an aide have to whisper: no, no, it&#8217;s the Aryan Nation; wrong extremists! It&#8217;s like suggesting that McCain is making a play for Kucinich voters, and having to be told that, no, you really meant Ron Paul: wrong losing candidate! No one who had any understanding at all of Iraq, or for that matter about the Shi&#8217;a/Sunni split and which side Iran was on, would get confused about this, any more than someone with any knowledge of US politics would get confused about whether neo-confederates were likely to be supporting blacks, or conservatives were likely to be supporting the Socialist Workers&#8217; Party. It is exactly that clueless.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hilzoy continues as to the political ramifications if the press and the public ever catch on that John McCain has a poor grasp of what really is going on with respect to foreign policy.  Foreign policy expertise is supposed to be his strong suit according to some pundits.  But quite frankly, this guy makes a George W. Bush ala 2000 actually look smart.  As bellicose as Dick Cheney and as clueless as George W. Bush – not a good combination for our next President.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/184135.php">Josh Marshall</a> continues the conversation:</p>
<blockquote><p>In almost every discussion of foreign policy, not just today but in previous years, what stands out is McCain&#8217;s inability to see beyond the immediate issues of military tactics to any firm grasp of strategy or America&#8217;s real vital interests. His free willingness to commit to a decades long occupation of Iraq is an example, his push for ground troops to be introduced during the Kosovo War is another. His refusal, almost inability, to grapple with the political failure of the surge is the most telling one if people will sift through its deeper implications. The idea that fighting jihadists in Iraq or policing the country&#8217;s sectarian and ethnic disputes is the calling of this century is one that is belied in virtually everything we see in flux in today&#8217;s world and which seems certain to affect us through the rest of our lifetimes and our children&#8217;s … Hillary Clinton has stipulated to McCain&#8217;s qualifications as Commander-in-Chief; and Obama, implicitly, does the same. But his record actually shows he&#8217;s one of the most dangerous people we could have in the Oval Office in coming years &#8212; not just because he&#8217;s a hothead in using the military, but more because he seems genuinely clueless about the real challenges and dangers the country is facing. He&#8217;s too busy living in the fantasy world where our future as a great power and our very safety are all bound up in Iraq.</p></blockquote>
