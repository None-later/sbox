                                <p>Over at <a href="http://krusekronicle.typepad.com/kruse_kronicle/2008/02/taxing-question.html">this blog</a>, I left a comment which summarized <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/everyone-cut-tax-cut.html">my post</a>.  The blog host was kind enough to offer <a href="http://krusekronicle.typepad.com/kruse_kronicle/2008/02/taxing-question.html#comment-105527428">this comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>PGL, I don&#8217;t think anyone is suggesting we ignore the impact of state and local taxes when thinking about economic justice but A) these taxes vary widely from locale to locale and B) they are not under the control of federal tax policy. I don&#8217;t see what these taxes have to do with whether or not the federal tax policy is just. </p>
<p>The impression being suggested by the cry of &#8220;tax cuts for the wealthy&#8221; is that these cuts have made the tax code less progresive and absolved the wealthy of obligations. What these numbers demonstrate is that the tax code is progressive and that the Bush cuts made them more progressive.</p>
<p>Now we can argue all sorts of reasons why these cuts were not appropriate. Maybe they set all the rates to low. Maybe they didn&#8217;t go far enough in their progressiveness. Maybe they shouldn&#8217;t have been made in the fiscal climate in which they were made. But I don&#8217;t see that any of these are warrant for the outrage of &#8220;tax cuts for the wealthy.&#8221; The wealthy come out of the process shouldering a greater proportion of the total federal tax burden. I would think that Democrats would at least want to celebrate this aspect. State and local taxes are not within the control of federal authorities.</p></blockquote>
<p>I did leave a follow-up comment but this seems to have disappeared.  I’m not sure why as it was simply the following three thoughts:</p>
<p>(1) His rejoinder did not address the point about deferred taxes from those Federal deficits</p>
<p>(2) If one is talking about the “federal tax burden”, one should say so and not say “all taxes”.</p>
<p>(3) Given the fact that the Federal government mandates certain activities from the state and local governments, suggesting that the FEDs don’t impact state and local taxes is a bit incomplete.</p>
<p>This is not verbatim as I don’t have access to the original post over at Michael’s place.  And I’ll admit that I said his rejoinder was not that convincing.  Now I don’t wish to accuse Michael of deleting a contrary view – it is odd that the comment used to be there and now is not.</p>

I&#8217;m not surprised that &#8220;respectable company&#8221; excludes a few ambulance-chasing lawyers looking for deep pockets and a some emotionally devastated parents looking for someone to blame.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark then points to <a href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2008/02/john-mccain-ent.html">Jake Tapper</a> who reports that McCain has joined those who pander fear among families who has the misfortune of a love one with autism:</p>
<blockquote><p>At a town hall meeting Friday in Texas, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., declared that &#8220;there’s strong evidence&#8221; that thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that was once in many childhood vaccines, is responsible for the increased diagnoses of autism in the U.S. &#8212; a position in stark contrast with the view of the medical establishment. McCain was responding to a question from the mother of a boy with autism, who asked about a recent story that the U.S. Court of Federal Claims and the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program had issued a judgment in favor of an unnamed child whose family claimed regressive encephalopathy and symptoms of autism were caused by thimerosal … Moreover, those scientists and organizations fear that powerful people lending credence to the thimerosal theory could dissuade parents from getting their children immunized &#8212; which in their view would lead to a very real health crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mark notes that this is not the first time that McCain has ignored science with proposals – that had they been adopted – could have resulted in many deaths.  Such behavior in a politician is appalling.  It’s not exactly the kind of character (or lack thereof) that I would to see in the next President.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>A topic often raised, but seldom examined closely on this list, is the wisdom or foolishness of marrying and/or having children when ones income is low.</p>
<p>&#8220;People shouldn&#8217;t have children if they can&#8217;t afford them,&#8221; is the typical line.  And superficially this makes perfect sense.  To give an extreme example, you can&#8217;t raise 12 kids in a tent.  Well, not legally.</p>
<p>One regular commenter, Lafayette, made a valiant attempt in the comments to codify the resources a man should accumulate before setting sail on the trackless ocean of parenthood.  I wish I could find it, it was sometime in 2007.</p>
<p>So here is my attempt to lay out the prudent financial predicates for reasonable child-rearing&#8211;</p>
<blockquote><p>1. A household income greater than the poverty line for that size of family.<br />2. In addition, income above that level sufficient to buy health insurance for that size of family.<br />3. Income dedicated to a life insurance policy for the family breadwinners.<br />4. Savings sufficient to pay all ordinary expenses for at least a year, including maintenance of the health insurance, in case of illness or job loss.<br />5. In addition, factor in a savings account strictly for the post secondary education of each child in the family.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, using these practical, modest numbers, what percentage of Americans should not have children?</p>
<p>$16,000 to $26,000 for a family of one to four children respectively is the poverty line listed by the <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/poverty/threshld/thresh05.html">Census Bureau</a>.  Statistics peg US households below this line at 12.4%. </p>
<p>However, that number does not include the other prudent expenses I listed – savings, insurance, and an education fund for the kids.  Would it be fair to guess that those costs would nearly double the original number?</p>
<p>If so, that&#8217;s a household income of $32,000 to raise one child, up to $52,000 for a couple with four children.</p>
<p>How many people have that sort of income?  To try to get a handle on this, here&#8217;s a handy chart showing median family income by family size for selected states.  (Data from <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/ust/eo/bapcpa/20080201/bci_data/median_income_table.htm">this table</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R8v6KM54AgI/AAAAAAAABA0/g0oWvcLr6Po/s1600-h/Noni+Mausa+-+Median+Family+Income+by+State.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_yBU2IH33oeM/R8v6KM54AgI/AAAAAAAABA0/g0oWvcLr6Po/s320/Noni+Mausa+-+Median+Family+Income+by+State.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Does this indicate to you as to me that a sizeable fraction, as much as half, of low income Americans would not be able to &#8220;prudently&#8221; bear and raise children, by the &#8220;can&#8217;t afford children&#8221; standard? And this is in the absence of unusual pressures on the family – health costs, job loss, etc.</p>
<p>If this is true &#8212; if it is simply not prudent for a large fraction of Americans to bear and raise children,  (that&#8217;s the employed people, remember, not the unemployed ones) – are we okay with that?  Childrearing is not a personal hobby like model airplanes, but a necessary part of nation building,  If full time work still pays too little for healthy adults to raise children, can we suspect there is an imbalance somewhere?</p>
<p>There is, I realize, a LOT of slack and slippage in these numbers.  Still, perhaps it gives us a starting place for engaging the &#8220;can&#8217;t afford&#8221; comments with numbers and their demographic implications.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>This one is by Noni Mausa.</p>
<p>Cactus here&#8230; </p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to add a few thoughts, if I may.  Call it personal observations.  The Ex-GF is 37, I&#8217;m 38, we&#8217;ve been married a bit more than a year, and we&#8217;re wondering whether we can afford to have children, and right now, the answer is no.  Last year, my income alone was above the 4 person family median for a California (we live in Los Angeles), but we still are very concerned.  This despite the fact that we&#8217;re frugal people and we&#8217;ve got a reasonable amount of money (equal to a few years of my income) socked away.  See, that&#8217;s more than most people have, but it isn&#8217;t much of a margin for error.</p>
<p>And its clear a margin for error is needed.  As a consultant, my income moves up and down, and right now work is very slow.  And it looks like it will be slow for a while.  Also, the Ex-GF is looking for a new job.  So I wonder&#8230; if I were to die, will there be enough for the Ex-GF to survive through ups and downs, let alone the Ex-GF and some kids?  I suspect the answer is no.  And one thing I know for certain&#8230; if something were to happen to me but I lingered on for a long time, there wouldn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Now, had we met and gotten married in the mid or late 90s, I have no doubts we&#8217;d have tried to have kids within the year.  The future looked bright.  And there was something out there that looked like a safety net, just in case things went downhill.  </p>
<p>I notice a preoccupation among some on the right about demographic trends, and whether the populations of Europe and the US are breeding quickly fast enough to replace themselves or whether the West will be simply be swamped by the progeny of the Third World.  Well, guess what.  If they want Americans to feel secure enough to have kids, they can support policies that lead to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">faster growth and more secure safety nets</a>.  Because from where I&#8217;m standing, these people are doing nothing more than exacerbating the problem, and they deserve a big part of the blame for the world turning out the way they fear it might.  (And someone should also tell them that <a rhef="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/05/abortions-and-income.html">incomes and abortions are negatively correlated</a>.)</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>If the value of our casualties were properly valued there would be none coming from Iraq.</p>
<p>The Commandant of the Marine Corps is (was) asking the Pentagon Inspector General to step in and examine the Franz Gayl allegations that a two year delay in providing MRAPs wasted Marines lives. &#8220;[H]undreds of deaths and injuries could have been prevented if incompetent minders and red tape had not sidetracked the effort to get the Mine Resistant Ambush Proof (MRAP&#8217;s) vehicles to the front lines in 2005 instead of 2007.</p>
<p>The Marine Corp&#8217;s excuses: they thought up-armored Hummers would work, and they (recognized that the military industry and its handlers would be non responsive) did not think that 1200 MRAP&#8217;s could be procured for Marine units in the two front-lines in Southwest Asia. </p>
<p>There being two diverse excuses poses more questions:</p>
<p>About the “minders”;</p>
<p>At the time the UUNS (universal urgent need statement) was submitted did anyone develop a technical solution to the UUNS that showed the Hummer would work? If one was done, as it must have to comply with certain Joint Chiefs&#8217; directives, a thing called a capability document would have been coordinated and engineers would have compared it to the up-armored Hummer and rendered an evaluation that it met the requirements defined in the capability document. The Marine Corps if it had that could immediately answer a lot of Gayl&#8217;s arguments. That the case has not been settled since Sep 2007 indicates that step was not done, and the assertion that the up-armored Hummers could or was thought to solve the UUNS is unsubstantiated.</p>
<p>The above is the way the services determine requirements for use in combat and lead into delivering hardware to work the problems. The MRAP fits neither the Future Combat System mold, too heavy, nor the amphibious mode, it sinks and the whole idea of amphibious operations is to go where there are soft points.</p>
<p>Someone needs to tell the “minders” that Mc Cain thinks this warfare state gravy train will last for 100 years.</p>
<p>About the “red tape”: there are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRAP_(armored_vehicle)">plenty of companies</a> making these things all over the world.</p>
<p>There is a South African Company that has been making them for the continuous wars in Angola and other border regions since the 1970&#8217;s. This company&#8217;s specs are easily acquired by a visit, the US and NATO has cooperated with South Africa in the arms trade for many years. Further research I found that the UN peacekeepers in Somalia from 1992 to 1994 used MRAP type vehicles and experienced fewer vehicle mine impact casualties than US forces in Somalia prior to the withdrawal after the Blackhawk engagements. </p>
<p>The long interest in MRAP by South Africa indicates the absolute poverty of the assertion that up-armor Hummers might work. </p>
<p>There is no logic, to my mind, that the Marine Corps might see the MRAP as taking money away from the long troubled, no mission Expeditionary Fighting Vehicle (EFV). There is a huge amount of money floating around to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is supplemental funding, there are funds coded for the Global War on Terror (GWOT, I see it as Taxpayer bilking). Lots of money out there.</p>
<p>The problem is the DoD system and its arcane set of priorities. Good vehicles or any equipment for that matter fast and cheap are not the priority. The end game is keeping the “industry” healthy. Meaning profit before the Marine or taxpayer.</p>
<p>So, what explains why the Corps did not buy South Africa vehicles and licenses to build it in quantity here in the States?</p>
<p>The US has vehicle manufacturers who can be hired to design new unproven MRAP type vehicles, with much more cost and good profit than buying a license to manufacture the South African design. There is an industry base to build and support despite the casualties suffered during the delayed, profitable project. </p>
<p>The Marine Corps could then pursue the “real” priority UUNS to stumble along on the Amphibious EFV trail, while the Army buys the MRAP, in a long blundering program at an estimated market value for the partners of $20B.</p>
<p>Bottom line the Marine Corps was going along with the &#8216;strategy and structure&#8217; of the DoD acquisition process which is profits before any military or humane considerations. The congress helps giving their contributors more profits rather than going fast and low cost with a good existing design.</p>
<p>Now there are numerous MRAP designs being built by different companies to divide the profits among a number of districts. The diverse designs pose huge logistics problems with differing components and training needs to operate and maintain them.</p>
<p>Then there are profits to be made in wasteful logistics support, as well.</p>
<p>It is interesting that a couple of US MRAP budget sponsors in the congress have come to Gayl&#8217;s aid in warning the Corps about his whistleblower status.</p>
<p>A thorough study would reveal the delay benefited of military industrial complex market share in the MRAP business area, at the cost of Army and Marine Corps casualties. </p>

                                <blockquote><p>“What will be the consequence of losses of over $1 trillion and, possibly, as high as $2 trillion? That would wipe out most of the capital of most of the US banking system and lead most of US banks and mortgage lenders – that are massively exposed to real estate – to go belly up. You would then have a systemic banking crisis of proportions that would be several orders of magnitude larger than the S&#038;L crisis, a crisis that ended up with a fiscal bailout cost of over $120 billion dollars. And the worrisome part of this scenario is that – with home prices likely to fall by 20% or more – this scenario of systemic banking crisis is becoming increasingly likely.” Nouriel Roubini at the committee hearings last week.</p>
<p>When I read that last paragraph in Roubini’s testimony to the Congress I am left a bit dazed and confused. That’s $1 trillion, or maybe $2 trillion, that may have just evaporated and the entire length of the testimony doesn’t even begin to raise the question, where did it all go? What are the consequences? Indeed. What would be the consequences of my stealing $100 out of the grocer’s till? So why does this testimony only focus on what now and leave entirely unspoken, how so?</p>
<p>Since this crises began in the fall of 2007 there have been an endless parade of analysis focused on what happened, how did it happen, what is likely to happen next, when will if happen and what can be done to deal with what is happening? What I haven’t been able to find in all these learned writings is, where did it all go? A balloon popped, but the balloon wasn’t filled with air. It was filled with hard money. The money that all the mortgage banks lent to all the buyers of what now may have been grossly over valued real estate. The paper generated by those loans (a mortgage is that process that turns cash into paper) was then turned back into cash again by the miracle of restructuring. The promises to repay became themselves objects to sell.</p>
<p>So where is all that cash? Who retains the funds represented by all those defaulting mortgages? Who retains the profits and fees generated by all that restructured paper, those collateralized debt obligations that weren’t so well collateralized? No one seems to care about where all the money went, but one thing I do know is that in the world of finance bubbles are filled with cash until they pop. Then there seems to be an evaporative effect and the money is now worthless debt. I’d like to know who it is that is still whole cloth, monetarily that is. Financial bubbles don’t occur as a result of subterranean hydro-thermal activity. It’s another form of hot air that is put in play.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A psychiatrist who has treated former military personnel at Guantánamo prison camp is telling a story of prisoner torture and guard suicide there, recounted to him by a National Guardsman who worked at Guantánamo just after it opened.</p>
<p>Dr. John R. Smith, 75, is a Oklahoma City psychiatrist who has done worked at military posts during the past few years. He is also a consultant for the University of Oklahoma&#8217;s Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Services, and is affiliated with the Veteran&#8217;s Affairs Administration Hospital in Oklahoma City. The court-appointed psychiatric examination of Timothy McVeigh, who bombed the Murrah Federal Building in 1995, was conducted by Smith. A few years ago, he became a contract physician, treating active duty members of the US military in need of psychotherapy.</p>
<p>Smith spoke on February 22, 2008, at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, held in Washington DC. His presentation dealt with the psychological impact on guards of working at Guantánamo . He focused on a chilling case history, of a patient he called &#8220;Mr. H.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8230;.</p>
<p>Smith said his presentation at the American Academy of Forensic Sciences meeting was the first time he&#8217;d ever spoken publicly about his Guantánamo patients. He decided to talk, he said, because he is concerned that veterans are generally ineligible for PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) disability benefits if the condition is not caused by combat. He considers the guards of Guantánamo &#8220;an overlooked group of victims.&#8221; But in making that case, Smith stepped into a unique role. Heretofore, almost all accounts of torture at Guantánamo have come from non-governmental human rights groups or detainees and their defense lawyers. The FBI accounts in 2004 were contradictory. Smith, a prestigious physician, relayed accounts from inside the military.</p></blockquote>

<p>With all due respect to Kruse Kronicle, showing only current Federal taxes is just stupid.  Didn’t we <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/understating-tax-burden-on-middle-class.html">explain why</a> already?</p>
<blockquote><p>Fine but that excludes the tax burdens imposed by state and local governments. More importantly, the share of GDP captured by Federal spending hasn’t declined all that much. So what has changed? Oh yea – the reliance on Federal borrowing which has deferred the Federal tax bite but not reduced it.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would hope someone would remind Kruse that the middle class and poor do pay state and local taxes and that these deferred Federal tax bills aren’t exactly going to be paid by Klingons.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/03/barack-obama-an.html">Mark Thoma</a> comes <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&#038;categ_id=5&#038;article_id=89455">Melvyn Krauss</a> and <a href="http://www.sadlyno.com/archives/8919.html">SadlyNo</a>.  Let’s have Melvyn (a conservative) set up to the microphone first as he takes the high road:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meritocracy is at the core of American conservative beliefs. So let&#8217;s face it: George W. Bush has been the worst US president in memory. His administration has been inept, corrupt, and without accomplishment. After this performance, why give the Republicans another turn at the helm?  Let&#8217;s give the other party a chance, even if its policies are not exactly what conservatives may like. In America, we call it &#8220;throwing the bums out.&#8221; When meritocracy is downgraded, as it has been during the Bush years, bad things happen. Worst of all, racism has flourished, because productivity and social utility have become less effective in protecting targets of discrimination.</p></blockquote>
<p>While SadlyNo is in a take no prisoners mood, he does bring us <a href="http://x/">this news</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama is hoping to appoint cross-party figures to his cabinet such as Chuck Hagel, the Republican senator for Nebraska and an opponent of the Iraq war, and Richard Lugar, leader of the Republicans on the Senate foreign relations committee … Earlier Obama had told the audience at a suburban high school rally in Dallas, Texas, that he intended to follow the example of his hero, President Abraham Lincoln, and appoint a cabinet of the talents, irrespective of party labels.</p></blockquote>
<p>The next President will need a cabinet of talents.  The problem many of us Democrats have had with the leadership of the GOP is that they ignore the “grown-ups” (as Brad DeLong often makes this point).  Hagel and Lugar are among the GOP’s grown-ups.  Reaching across the aisle for talent to move this nation forward is going to be a critical element if the next President hopes to undo the tremendous damage the current Administration has done.  </p>
<p>Mark Thoma ends his post with a question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is it time for me to rethink my partisan tendencies and lack of trust, or is Obama making a big mistake?</p></blockquote>
<p>This one is easy for me.  Obama is doing the right thing.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2008/03/brad-at-sadly-no-is-sadly-naive.html">Robert Waldman</a> see genius in what Obama is proposing to do:</p>
<blockquote><p>Brad at Sadly No is Sadly naive. he doesn&#8217;t understand that Obama plans to destroy the Republican party by appointing Republican Senators to the Cabinet … Bill Clinton didn&#8217;t get it and he is a genius. Senators are very powerful. Cabinet (some)ecretaries have power somewhere between that of the average secretary (lots if their boss is dumb) and that of the average cabinet (made of wood noticed only if it catches on fire). Clinton&#8217;s worst mistake was making Senator Lloyd Bentson (D-Tex) a mere secretary and giving his very precious seat to Kay Baily Forehead.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, Kay Baily Forehead would have been a terrible choice for Treasury Secretary.  Bentson – on the other hand – did a very good job while he was in the office.  Robert continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>The name of the game is &#8220;get to 60&#8221; and any means are fair. Obama plans to play to win.  OK OK he should appoint Olimpia to be UN embassatrix and Collins (if, heaven forfend, she is re-elected) embassatrix to the moon, but he can&#8217;t be too obvious.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given how screwed up our foreign policy is, there may be a shortage of those willing to be ambassadors to places on this planet – especially in the Middle East.</p>
