                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/world/articles/2008/03/06/top_iraq_contractor_skirts_us_taxes_offshore/?page=1">Farah Stockman</a> has an excellent story about another side of the Halliburton schemes to profit off the Iraq War:</p>
<blockquote><p>Kellogg Brown &#038; Root, the nation&#8217;s top Iraq war contractor and until last year a subsidiary of Halliburton Corp., has avoided paying hundreds of millions of dollars in federal Medicare and Social Security taxes by hiring workers through shell companies based in this tropical tax haven. More than 21,000 people working for KBR in Iraq &#8211; including about 10,500 Americans &#8211; are listed as employees of two companies that exist in a computer file on the fourth floor of a building on a palm-studded boulevard here in the Caribbean. Neither company has an office or phone number in the Cayman Islands.  The Defense Department has known since at least 2004 that KBR was avoiding taxes by declaring its American workers as employees of Cayman Islands shell companies, and officials said the move allowed KBR to perform the work more cheaply, saving Defense dollars.  But the use of the loophole results in a significantly greater loss of revenue to the government as a whole, particularly to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. And the creation of shell companies in places such as the Cayman Islands to avoid taxes has long been attacked by members of Congress.</p></blockquote>
<p>But wait a second.  These workers won’t receive Social Security benefits for these years.  Simply privatization through this Cayman scheme you say.  Won’t the workers know this, bid up their wages, and save the difference in their private retirement accounts?  Well – maybe if they know about it:</p>
<blockquote><p>In interviews with more than a dozen KBR workers registered through the Cayman Islands companies, most said they did not realize that they had been employed by a foreign firm until they arrived in Iraq and were told by their foremen, or until they returned home and applied for unemployment benefits. &#8220;They never explained it to us,&#8221; said Arthur Faust</p></blockquote>
<p>I smell litigation and it seems lawyers are already involved.  When they asked the Vice President about this little scheme – he referred all questions to his personal attorney. Go figure!</p>

<blockquote><p>Jonah Goldberg&#8217;s Feb. 26 column said a Che Guevara-emblazoned Cuban flag was hanging in the Houston headquarters of Barack Obama&#8217;s campaign. The flag had been in the office of some Obama volunteers, not campaign headquarters</p></blockquote>
<p>One if the LATimes readers is a Santa Monica housing consultant named <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oew-pally6mar06,0,1890278.story">Karin Pally</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Jonah Goldberg provides us with textbook examples of the logical fallacies employed to such good effect by Joseph McCarthy and his minions in the 1950s. I thought we had driven a stake through the heart of McCarthyism, and that Red-baiting had met its well-deserved end. But Goldberg, who is as slimy as Gollum, the cave-dwelling hobbit in &#8220;Lord of the Rings,&#8221; has brought it back with a vengeance &#8230; Goldberg is really beneath contempt &#8212; he&#8217;s engaged in a smear campaign, resurrected McCarthy Red-baiting techniques such as proof by assertion and guilt by association and used a series of logical fallacies to imply that tenuous or even unsubstantiated connections between the candidates and people Goldberg accuses of violence &#8220;prove&#8221; that the candidates themselves support violence.  There&#8217;s no point in wishing that Goldberg wouldn&#8217;t do this; clearly he&#8217;s being well paid for writing nasty innuendo and rehashing &#8220;scandals&#8221; circulating widely on the Web. But it&#8217;s distressing to see The Times publish this garbage.</p></blockquote>
<p>I invite you to read Karin’s whole letter as it does a much better job of dissecting this trash from Mr. Goldberg than I did.</p>

                                <p>Administrations like the current one talk the talk with respect to free trade but don’t walk the walk.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/03/protectionists.html">Mark Thoma</a> finds one Republican who is at least honest about his party’s slant towards <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/06/opinion/06lighthizer.html?ex=1362459600&#038;en=ec59e5df8ca2c842&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink">trade protection</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Free trade has long been popular with liberals, and it remains so with liberal elites today. The editorial pages of major newspapers consistently support free trade. Ted Kennedy supported the advance of free trade. President Bill Clinton fought hard to win approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Despite some of his campaign rhetoric, Barack Obama is careful to express qualified support for free trade, even when stumping in the industrial Midwest. Moreover, many American conservatives have opposed free trade. Jesse Helms, the most outspoken conservative in the Senate for three decades, was no free trader. Neither was Alexander Hamilton, who could be considered the founder of American conservatism. For almost 100 years after the Civil War, the Republican Party (led by men like Lincoln and McKinley) was overtly protectionist. Theodore Roosevelt, a hero of John McCain’s, wrote that “pernicious indulgence in the doctrine of free trade seems inevitably to produce fatty degeneration of the moral fiber.”  The first significant Republican free trader was President Dwight Eisenhower. But Harry Truman tried to recruit him to run for the White House as a Democrat, and his political affiliation was not clear until he actually began running for the 1952 Republican nomination. Conservatives in 1952 supported the presidential bid of Robert Taft, a steadfast opponent of free trade. If you watched the Republican presidential debates — and had no other knowledge of economic history — you might believe that Ronald Reagan, the personification of modern conservatism, was a pure free trader. During a debate in Michigan, for example, Mr. McCain said that President Reagan “must be spinning in his grave” to hear Republicans expressing concerns about free trade. But while free traders like to quote some of President Reagan’s open-markets rhetoric, they did not like many of his actual trade policies. President Reagan often broke with free-trade dogma. He arranged for voluntary restraint agreements to limit imports of automobiles and steel (an industry whose interests, by the way, I have represented). He provided temporary import relief for Harley-Davidson. He limited imports of sugar and textiles. His administration pushed for the “Plaza accord” of 1985, an agreement that made Japanese imports more expensive by raising the value of the yen. Each of these measures prompted vociferous criticism from free traders. But they worked. By the early 1990s, doubts about Americans’ ability to compete had been impressively reduced.</p></blockquote>
<p>We should be fair – Bush41 had a decent free trade record.  And a junior economist in the Reagan Administration likely did advocate less protectionism.  His name?  Paul Krugman.  Mark’s take on what Robert Lighthizer wrote is:</p>
<blockquote><p>If Republicans want to label themselves as the party of protectionists (more walls!), that&#8217;s fine with me. But attributing the strength of the US economy in the 1990s to the protectionist policies of the Reagan administration is more than a bit of a stretch.</p></blockquote>
<p>While Mark is correct, let’s recall the historical context of the early Reagan years when he decided to ignore the advice of a young Dr. Krugman.  We had a decline in net export demand contributing to the 1982 recession.  Of course, this decline was caused by the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/kudlow-on-reagans-strong-dollar-policy_04.html">strong dollar policy</a> that <a href="http://kudlow.nationalreview.com/post/?q=Zjk4MTcxZWViMjE1ZGI3OWEwY2Q0NmYwNzcwYjI3NWI=">Lawrence Kudlow</a> thought was great.  I guess Lighthizer does not that the abandonment of this stupid strong dollar policy (i.e., the dollar devaluation that he notes) likely had more to do with the improvement in net export demand than the tariffs and quotas that Lighthizer endorses.</p>
<p>Finally, it does appear that trade protection to dollar devaluation is preferred by the likes of Lighthizer and Kudlow as trade protection can be given to the friends of the GOP leadership.  But then true conservatives like Greg Mankiw and other proponents of free trade likely wish politicians would not play these games.  Some of us on the left – such as Mark and myself – tend to agree with these true conservatives.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The lynchpin of the global economy, oil, has a tankful of contradictions.</p>
<p>Conundrum #1: A Free, unrestricted market is the presumed premise upon which globalization proceeds. Yet the largest cartel on the planet controls the pricing and production of oil, the most essential commodity for continued growth. Everything, from cars to cabbages, depends upon its adequate supply. If the free, market of globalization is to proceed as planned, how can it succeed if a cartel controls the single most important commodity for its continued success?</p>
<p>Additionally, no one seems to be clear as to why the price of oil continues its upward climb. If a cartel, through production quotas, cannot control the price, who or what does?</p>
<p>In the past, the OPEC cartel seemed firmly in control of the price of oil. Proceeding on the assumption that this fact is still true, President Bush asked his friends at OPEC to raise production.</p>
<p>OPEC refused, admitting, for the first time, that it no longer controlled the price. Asserting there were no shortages, OPEC blamed both the falling dollar and speculators.</p>
<p>Conundrum # 2: If market speculators are driving the price, how are they doing it if there are no shortages as OPEC claims. Are we ready to toss in the economic towel and claim supply and demand are no longer operative?</p>
<p>Conundrum #3: If the falling dollar is driving the price, how can the price continue to reach all-time highs even after the price is adjusted for inflation?</p>
<p>Conundrum #4: If there are indeed shortages, where are they? Who is experiencing them? Aside from Nigeria, which has its own problems with local supplies, are there shortages anywhere? During the Iran hostage crises, gas stations were open sporadically. Sometimes they had gas; sometimes they did not. That is a shortage. While peak oilers can claim that for the last few years production has been flat, can they explain the rise in price as a function of supply and demand?</p>
<p>Is the price rising on the expectation that we are indeed approaching peak oil?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, even though many fields are in decline and even though discoveries are not coming on board as quickly as they once did and even though the world&#8217;s appetite for energy is increasing, we will never know when peak oil has arrived until after the fact.</p>
<p>It seems to me something has to give here.</p>
<p>Do we toss out the principle of supply and demand?</p>
<p>Do we toss out a well-functioning market place?</p>
<p>Are we approaching peak oil? Who knows it and how do they know it? Can these knowledgeable folk explain it in terms of supply and demand?</p>

                                <p>Reader Peter Pajakowski sent me a link to this post at Heritage by <a href="http://www.heritage.org/Research/Taxes/wm1835.cfm">J. D. Foster</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When pressed about the harmful effects on the economy, proponents of higher taxes often fall back on what can be called the &#8220;Clinton defense.&#8221; President Clinton pushed a major tax increase through Congress in 1993 and, so the story goes, the economy boomed. How then can tax increases be so bad for the economy? The inference is even stronger&#8211;that higher taxes actually strengthened the economy. The Clinton defense is superficially plausible, but it fails under closer scrutiny. Economic growth was solid but hardly spectacular in the years immediately following the 1993 tax increase; the real economic boom occurred in the latter half of the decade, after the 1997 tax cut. Low taxes are still a key to a strong economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>In summary, coming out of a recession into a period when the economy should grow relatively rapidly, President Clinton signed a major tax increase. The average growth rate over his first term was a solid 3.2 percent. In 1997, at a time when the expansion was well along and economic growth should have slowed, Congress passed a modest net tax cut. The economy grew by a full percentage point-per-year faster over his second term than over his first term. The evidence is fairly clear: The tax cuts, especially the reduction in the capital gains tax rate, made a major contribution to a strong economy. Given this observation, it seems likely, though admittedly less certain, that the tax increases in 1993, while not derailing the economy as many had forecast at the time, did indeed slow the recovery compared to what the economy could have achieved.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously, there&#8217;s a lot between those two paragraphs, but I think these excerpts make his point:  if Clinton hadn&#8217;t raised income tax rates, growth would have been much stronger from 1993 to 1997, and if he hadn&#8217;t lowered capital gains tax rates in 1997, we might well have run into a recession right about then or shortly thereafter, and who knows, we might even have been invaded by the fish people of Mulgar.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted many, many times before, there are two ways to lower taxes.  One is the public way:  announce a rate cut and brag about it.  The other is quieter, but more effective&#8230;  up enforcement.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what I mean.  As I recall from my long ago days in transfer pricing, the entirety of the law when it come to transfer pricing issues is two lines a much bigger law.  That&#8217;s everything that Congress said about the issue in a law that the President went ahead and signed.  But there are thousands of pages of regulations on transfer pricing, and associated issues like &#8220;advanced pricing agreements.&#8221;  That, pronouncements by IRS officials, and court cases brought (usually by the IRS) are what PWC and E&#038;Y and the rest of the firms offering tax advice study carefully when determining how far they could push on behalf of clients, because that is the IRS thinking on the matter.  Congress doesn&#8217;t do nuance &#8211; it passes a law, and the Executive Branch has to figure out what it means when it comes to enforcement.  And its not just tax issues related to corporate clients that are treated that way &#8211; the folks at H&#038;R Bloch and your local accountants have their own set of regulations, pronouncements by IRS officials, and court cases that they look at when figuring out how far things could be pushed with individual income tax payers.</p>
<p>So the important thing, in the end, is not whether the rates go up or down.  Cut tax rates and raise enforcement&#8230; and taxes paid as a percentage of total income rise.  Raise tax rates and lower enforcement&#8230; and taxes paid as a percentage of total income fall.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve already noted graphically that the percentage of total income paid in taxes<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">rose during every Democratic administration and fell during every Republican administration</a> since 1952.  (The underlying IRS data is <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175814,00.html">here</a>.)  Despite the 1964 tax cuts, taxes paid as a percentage of income was up by 1968.  (There was a slight dip from 1964 to 1965, but by 1966 that ratio was already higher than in 1964.)  Similarly, look at  GHW &#8220;Read My Lips&#8221; Bush &#8211; there is no year during his administration during which the percentage of people&#8217;s income paid in taxes rose.  Not one year in which actual taxes increased, despite the fact that he increased marginal tax rates.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Clinton.  Taxes paid as a percentage of income increased every single year of the Clinton administration but one &#8211; 1998.  That year, they stayed constant.  So score one for Foster&#8217;s story?  Well, sure, if you are able to remember how the big effective hike in 1999 strangled the economy.  Or maybe the big hike in 2000?  </p>
<p>And what about the converse?  It took the full 8 years of the Clinton administration for the ratio of taxes paid to income to go from 8.9% to 11.6%&#8230; but by 2003 those rates were down to 8.2% again.  Shouldn&#8217;t there have been one heck of a boom going on from 2001 to 2003 if Foster&#8217;s story has any merit whatsoever?  After all, the recession ended in November of 2001, and taxes were going down, down, down.  That&#8217;s the exact opposite of the early Clinton years, right?</p>
<p>And&#8230;  then let&#8217;s look at the last few years of data&#8230; what&#8217;s this?  The ratio rose in 2004 and 2005?  Well, those must have been the worse years during the Bush administration when it comes to economic growth, right?  Right?</p>

<p>In <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/ilsm-on-whistleblowing-mrap-delays.html">comments to my post on the MRAP</a> Movie Guy asked: &#8220;Those who oppose the future force structure of DoD are proposing what organizational Troop strength, equipment, and force capabilities?&#8221;</p>
<p>I started a reply (also in comments) but I think this is worth a short post&#8230;  Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;d like to see&#8230;</p>
<p>How about a US military force built on threats, which are met with things that work and don&#8217;t cost 3 or 4 times the estimates.</p>
<p>The Air Force just selected the Airbus 330 for its new air refueling tanker. It can carry 37000 Gal (210,000 pounds)of common military aviation fuel. A typical fighter/bomber can expect to get 600 gal in a &#8216;drink&#8217;, and it cannot be too low on gas when meets the tanker. How many situations might require, or is it even possible for a tanker to service or off load fuel into 60 fighter/bombers?</p>
<p>And why buy 197 of these?</p>
<p>The right force structure is one based on real needs, and rational, low cost responses to the actual threats; and not for profits. </p>
<p>That said look at the percent of GDP that EU nations spend and that is a guide to right funding. The EU takes the 3% of GDP the US spends on unneeded arms, empire building, which are built in the most costly manner and provides their citizens social security.</p>
<p>The new USAF Euro tanker is not for passing gas, it is for hauling 220 troopers at a time. The bait is aging but very servicable KC-135 exchanged for people haulers.  This will put the civil reserve air fleet (CRAF) out of business. Own a fleet so they don&#8217;t have to use CRAF in a rare emergency. How is that for huge cost to not have to activate the CRAF? When was the last large deployment of CRAF??</p>
<p>What will the Airlines do if they lose the maintenance funding they get for keeping airplanes on the CRAF list?</p>

<blockquote><p>In standard models of asset pricing, negative real interest rates are most likely to arise if growth expectations are particularly low or if uncertainty is particularly high. Low growth expectations encourage households to save, which drives down equilibrium rates of return. High uncertainty drives up risk premiums, which in turn drives down the return on safe assets, perhaps below zero. Both forces seem to be working now.</p></blockquote>
<p>A good description for why real interest rates are indeed low.  I would just add that low growth expectations may also cause a drop in investment demand.  All three explanations send shivers down my spine as far as the prospect for avoiding a recession this year.  </p>
<p>But back to our source, which is FRED® (Federal Reserve Economic Data).  There are lots of different notes with different maturities and due dates.  There are only two other reported series that show negative real rates with several of them reporting real rates closer to 1%.  So why is the 5-year note that is due on April 15, 2010 the one to watch?</p>
