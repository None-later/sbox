<p>The Smartest Morons in the Room</p>
<p>Back when Enron imploded, I was wondering to myself about the motivation of some of the players.  I can understand the greed and fraud, and the looking aside when fraud was being perpetrated.  I like to believe that I would never get caught up in that, but I&#8217;ve never been placed in the situation some of these folks were in, namely where a little fraud could result in humongous rewards.  (I&#8217;ve also been fortunate enough never to be placed in the reverse situation, where giving in to fraud was necessary for survival.)  There&#8217;s something to be said about that line in that old Catholic prayer, the Our Father:  &#8220;lead me not into temptation.&#8221;</p>
<p>So while I don&#8217;t condone the behavior of the <strikethrough>players</strikethrough> perpetrators at Enron, I am at least able to understand it.  But the stupidity is harder to fathom.  Consider a guy like Andy Fastow, the CFO.  Here was a dude who was, by all accounts, a smart guy, and he was at least as informed as anyone in the company about what was going on.  Put another way &#8211; he should have been the first person to spot it when Enron&#8217;s situation became untenable and its demise became unavoidable.  That point would have given ample time to transfer some serious moolah out of the reach of the law (criminal or civil), not to mention himself and his family.  He could easily be living the good life in some beautiful beach town far away right now, rather than being <a href="http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&#038;needingMoreList=false&#038;LastName=Fastow&#038;Middle=&#038;FirstName=Andrew&#038;Race=U&#038;Sex=U&#038;Age=&#038;x=19&#038;y=24">inmate #14343-179</a> at  Oakdale Federal Detention Center in Louisiana.   And if he had made his move early enough, he might even pulled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Pai">this</a> off.</p>
<p>Lately, I&#8217;ve been thinking of Enron again.  See, there were some reputedly very smart people who engaged in some very shady business that was not sustainable and they had the information to know it was not sustainable&#8230; and they stuck around too long, finding themselves still at the party when the when the roof caved in.  Sure, not everyone involved had access to enough information to know things couldn&#8217;t last, but many, many of them did.  And sure, the story isn&#8217;t ending the Enron way &#8211; courtesy of our illustrious President, our esteemed future President, the honorable dude who was hoping to be our esteemed future President, and a whole host of other worthies in Washington, now we&#8217;re all being looted in a desperate effort to keep these folks comfortable.  But let&#8217;s be realistic &#8211; this last batch of nation-wide theft could never have been anticipated by the folks at Goldman, Welfare, Queen, &#038; Sachs and is merely, for them, a fortuitous accident.  But the ending is nowhere near as happy for the Welfare Queen class as it would have been had they simply walked away a couple years ago, as for instance this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Paulson">fine fellow</a> did, albeit inadvertently.  </p>
<p>So what&#8217;s going on?  Does greed blind people?  Are these folks really the imbeciles they appear to be in hindsight?  To be honest, I&#8217;m starting to think folks like Fastow and Paulson really have little actual intelligence at all.  They may have benefited from connections, and they may know some arcane subject pretty well, but clearly they cannot see how things connect to each other.   And its a real shame that people like that are often those that get elevated to a point where they can do <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=george+bush&#038;btnG=Google+Search&#038;aq=f&#038;oq=">some serious damage</a>.  And the fact that this sort of thing keeps happening makes me wonder about the rest of us &#8211; me included &#8211; who tolerate living in a world where buffoons run the show.  Perhaps those morons really are the smartest guys in the room.  <br />____________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2008/12/notice-200883-should-foreign-banks-get-in-the-loophole-too.html">ataxingmatter</a> Linda Beale makes a statement:</p>
<blockquote><p>The International Banking Association wants more tax goodies from Uncle Sam&#8211;for branches of foreign banks.  The idea seems to be that anything that has been done for domestic banks ought to be available to them too&#8211;even when it is Treasury&#8217;s decision not to enforce a clear statement of Congress in section 382 against domestic banks that acquire loser banks.  They insist that Treasury shouldn&#8217;t enforce the law in regards to foreign banks, either, so that they can save even more in their tax payments to the US.</p>
<p>The House already has a bill out to undo (though only prospectively) the Treasury override of Congressional law, sponsored by Lloyd Doggett, the nemesis of the corporate anti-tax lobbying group because of his dogged (no pun intended) support of a bill to codify the economic substance act.  See this release.  Senator Bernie Sanders&#8217; bill would apply retroactively, possibly affecting some of the deals done to garner the benefit, like Wells Fargo&#8217;s takeover of Wachovia or PNC&#8217;s of another loser bank.  See, e.g., Lawmakers Try to End Tax Break on Bank Mergers, DealBook, Nov. 24, 2008.  </p>
<p>I think the Notice should be made retroactively null and void, as in Sanders&#8217; bill (rather than Doggett&#8217;s). But of course all the corporate lobbyists will holler that the world will come tumbling down if these deals aren&#8217;t allowed to garner the tax benefits that they expected because of Treasury&#8217;s invalid notice.  Congress should ignore that.  Corporate lobbyists are paid to whine and cry about the awful things that will happen to their patrons if Congress acts responsibly.  Congress, on the other hand, is paid to act responsibly.  And, if fact, these deals won&#8217;t necessarily fall through without the section 382 tax break&#8211;Wells Fargo even claims in public documents that the tax breaks were of little consequence in its decision.  See Another Bank Deal Uses Treasury&#8217;s Tax Break, DealBook, Dec. 4, 2008. </p>
<p>The longer Congress waits to act, the more deals there will be, and the more the lobbyists will whine about &#8220;deal expectations&#8221; and dire consequences. The DealBook piece above indicates a deal between Capitol One and Chevy Chase Bank, where the TARP assets to which Capita One will gain access exceed the cash it will spend to get the bank, and then there are the tax losses&#8211;with the 2008-83 tax break&#8211;thrown in as a special extra sweetener.  Nutto.  Treasury&#8217;s TARP program is basically serving the same greedy interests that speculated us into the mess we&#8217;re in, and not doing much at all for ordinary taxpayers. </p>
<p>Whether or not the House and Senate act soon to undo the damage Treasury did with Notice 2008-83, Treasury should not take its action one step further.  There is no reason at all to legitimize telling foreign banks that they too can disregard the law.  At that rate, Treasury might as well decide to &#8220;enact&#8221; whatever tax policy it wants, whether Congress has done so or not.  How about a freeze on all corporate taxes, since the Bush Administration professes to believe that such tax cuts are a good antidote to any ill.  Or a zero percent tax on all capital gains (not just the first $32,550 for those who have no other income, which is scandalous enough in itself), since most of the Bush administration professes to believe that zero taxation on capital income would be good for the economy.  If Treasury can simply decide not to enforce any particular law against any particular taxpayer, we are no longer a democracy governed by the rule of law.  This is the same point that many have been making throughout this administration about the White House preference for &#8220;signing statements&#8221;&#8211;there represent a similar statement of executive intransigence and intention not to comply with the constitutional role of executing the laws enacted by Congress.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/02/business/02tarp.html?_r=1&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink">The NYT</a> describes the beginning role of the committee and chairman Elizabeth Warren to follow the money, in addition to <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09161.pdf">GAO report</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;“You can’t just say, ‘Credit isn’t moving through the system,’ ” she said in her first public comments since being named to the panel. “You have to ask why.”</p>
<p>If the answer is that banks do not have money to lend, it would make sense to push capital into their hands, as the Treasury has been doing over the last two months, she continued. But if the answer is that their potential borrowers are getting less creditworthy with each passing day, “pouring money into banks isn’t going to fix that problem,” she said&#8230;<br />&#8230;</p>
<p>Like much of the public, lawmakers “have just been stunned by these economic and financial developments,” she said. “There wasn’t time even to develop a coherent list of questions to ask Treasury about what it’s doing and what it plans to do — and whether either of those are likely to address what’s going wrong.”</p>
<p>She added: “Our role is to make sure that the right questions are asked as early as possible.”</p>
<p>In that spirit, she promised that Congress would get the panel’s first report on Dec. 10, “laying out the central questions that Treasury should be addressing as it spends the taxpayers’ money.”</p>
<p>Meetings with Treasury officials so far have made her question whether they understand that “household financial health is profoundly tied to the economic health of the nation,” she said. “You cannot repair this economy if you can’t repair those families, and I’m not sure the people directing the bailout see that as their job.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>In her view, the government should be trying to create more reliable customers for those banks by shoring up the fragile finances of the millions of American families that could not save, borrow or spend even if their banks were flush with capital.</p>
<p>“Any effective policy has to start with the households,” she said. “Years of flat wages, low savings and high debt have left America’s households extremely vulnerable.”</p>
<p>Ms. Warren, on the law faculty at Harvard since 1995, has written extensively and testified frequently before Congress on consumer credit laws and personal bankruptcy reform. She has been a member of several government advisory panels addressing consumer finance issues, and is the co-author of “The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers &#038; Fathers Are Going Broke” (Basic Books, 2003).</p>
<p>Ms. Warren will also be responsible for getting the panel up and running quickly and steering it around the two other monitors put in place by the legislation, the Government Accountability Office, whose first report on the bailout is due Tuesday, and a special inspector general who is not yet on the job. (Neil M. Barofsky, a veteran federal prosecutor in Manhattan, has been nominated by the White House but is still awaiting Senate confirmation.)</p>
<p>The specific bailout investments, transactions and employment decisions need to be monitored closely to make sure they are appropriate and ethical, she said. “But we need to draw a distinction between policy oversight and procedural oversight,” she added. “I see our role as lying more in the policy realm, so I don’t think we duplicate those efforts.”</p>
<p>The panel is also required by law to provide Congress with recommendations for reforms to the financial regulatory structure, a report that she said it would deliver by Jan. 20.</p>
<p>Despite Ms. Warren’s ambitious timetable, the new Congressional panel is having a bumpy start.</p>
<p>Created with the law’s passage on Oct. 3, it existed only in theory until Nov. 14, when its first three members were appointed by the Democratic leadership in Congress. Besides Ms. Warren, they are Damon Silvers, an associate general counsel of the AFL-CIO and the panel’s new deputy chairman, and Richard H. Neiman, the state superintendent of banks for New York. </p></blockquote>

<p>Passing on Corporate Taxes to Consumers and the Bail-Out</p>
<p>There seems to be relatively irrational belief among many conservatives that <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=" corporate>corporate taxes are simply passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices</a>.  It leaves out the obvious &#8211; if companies felt they could simply raise prices, they&#8217;d do it whether there were taxes or not.  After all, why leave money on the table?  Conversely, if they feel the consumer is already paying as much as the consumer is willing to bear, they&#8217;ll be very careful about passing on any increases in their own costs, and if there are any new costs (including taxes) they&#8217;ll probably absorb the bulk of them.  Put another way  &#8211; he who is desperate pays, and he who is more desperate pays more.  If the seller&#8217;s supply curve is more inelastic than the buyer&#8217;s demand curve, the seller will absorb more of the taxes &#8211; even taxes on the buyer.  If the buyer&#8217;s demand curve is more inelastic, the buyer will absorb of taxes, including corporate taxes.  </p>
<p>Not that logic or empirical observation means much to the folks who believe this particular irrational belief.  If they did, the belief wouldn&#8217;t be irrational, after all.  But it does raise a question &#8211; given recent events, how come we aren&#8217;t seeing anyone arguing the flip side of the coin, namely that a subsidy (i.e., a negative tax) on corporations will be passed on to consumers?  Shouldn&#8217;t one of the proponents of the notion that &#8220;corporate taxes should be eliminated because they&#8217;re paid for by consumers anyway&#8221; be telling us that by dumping untold trillions of dollars into assorted corporations, all of us who are unconnected with those corporations are going to collectively see our incomes increase by that amount?  What am I missing?<br />______________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.boston.com/news/health/articles/2008/11/30/the_doctor_will_see_all_of_you_now/">Another health story by the Boston Globe</a> gives new meaning to the term group practice:</p>
<blockquote><p>When Dr. Gene Lindsey arrived to see his 4 p.m. appointment on a recent Thursday, his nine patients already were seated on folding chairs arranged in a semicircle around a table of snacks. Lindsey, a cardiologist, shook each patient&#8217;s hand, rolled up his sleeves, and, for the next 90 minutes, examined them, one by one.</p>
<p>As he listened to lungs and hearts, he discussed their personal medical details out loud.</p>
<p>Since July, Lindsey has been seeing his Harvard Vanguard Medical Associates patients only in groups, formally called shared medical appointments. It&#8217;s part of an ambitious plan by Harvard Vanguard to ease physician shortages, and reduce patient and doctor dissatisfaction over constantly feeling rushed during appointments.</p>
<p>Many patients, it turns out, are willing to sacrifice privacy and modesty for improved access to doctors. Patients willing to see their doctor in a group visit generally can get appointments far sooner. And many pa tients have similar problems and questions, and can learn from one another in the group visits. If a particular examination requires that a patient disrobe, the doctor and patient move into a private room for that portion of the checkup.</p>
<p>Doctors don&#8217;t have to repeat the same information to patients individually throughout the day. And if the groups &#8211; offered in many specialties &#8211; are full, doctors make out better financially. Many insurers generally pay what they would if the doctor were seeing those patients individually. A doctor normally would see four to six patients in 90 minutes if he or she were seeing them one-on-one.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was fabulous,&#8221; said Nicholas Poly, an 80-year-old retired engineer who saw Lindsey during the Thursday group visit. &#8220;I have problems similar to what other people have. I get to hear their questions too, and that&#8217;s good.&#8221;</p>
<p>While many patients seem to like group appointments, they are clearly not for everyone.</p>
<p>Walter Kelly, 89, began seeing Lindsey five years ago after he got a pacemaker for his heart murmur. &#8220;I was mostly curious,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I am not an intensely private person so I don&#8217;t mind sharing these sorts of things.&#8221; But after attending two group visits, Kelly said he would rather see Lindsey individually if that were an option.</p>
<p>Harvard Vanguard found in a survey this year that 77 percent of patients who had attended one said they would do so again, 15 percent said they weren&#8217;t sure, and 5 percent said they would not schedule another group visit.</p></blockquote>
<p>This could be useful for patients as well&#8230;just be careful.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8230;using Citigroup as Exhibit A — how some of our country’s best-paid bankers were overrated dopes who had no idea what they were selling, or greedy cynics who did know and turned a blind eye. But it wasn’t only the bankers. This financial meltdown involved a broad national breakdown in personal responsibility, government regulation and financial ethics.</p>
<p>So many people were in on it: People who had no business buying a home, with nothing down and nothing to pay for two years; people who had no business pushing such mortgages, but made fortunes doing so; people who had no business bundling those loans into securities and selling them to third parties, as if they were AAA bonds, but made fortunes doing so; people who had no business rating those loans as AAA, but made a fortunes doing so; and people who had no business buying those bonds and putting them on their balance sheets so they could earn a little better yield, but made fortunes doing so.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>In one of the stupidest wastes of Treasury monies this month—a major accomplishment, though AIG hasn&#8217;t hit the trough again yet, so there might be hope—the Treasury wants to <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/12/wsj-treasury-considers-plan-to-lower.html">subsidize <em>new</em> mortgages</a> (link to CR):<br />
<blockquote>Under the plan, Treasury would buy securities underpinning loans guaranteed by the two mortgage giants, which are temporarily under the control of the government, as well as those guaranteed by the Federal Housing Administration. [amazement, not to mention emphasis, mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>This will, of course, address the underlying problem perfectly:<br />
<blockquote>Government officials are under pressure to stem foreclosures, which underpin much of the current financial crisis. Treasury has struggled for months to come up with a plan that would ease the market without appearing to bail out homeowners and lenders.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s Deborah Solomon, so we expect lies and deception.  So let&#8217;s fix that last sentence:<br />
<blockquote>Treasury has struggled for months to come up with a plan that would ease the market without appearing to bail out homeowners <strong>having already provided ridiculous amounts of money to the</strong> lenders.</p></blockquote>
<p>There.  Much better.</p>
<p>*Someone please break the news to <a href="http://economy.nationaljournal.com/2008/12/is-the-deficit-a-threat-to-a-f.php#1183590">the Ed Leamers of the world</a> that those are tax dollars that are being used as &#8220;monetary policy,&#8221; which will be just as much of a liability to future generations as his &#8220;fear of public goods spending,&#8221; except that we get a boost to profits when we build public goods.  Good thing he&#8217;s not an economist or&#8230;never mind.</p>

                                <p>This is the question raised by Brenda Rosser in a couple of posts at Econospeak <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/12/is-it-true-that-foreigners-finance.html">Is it true?</a> To which Barkley Rosser (no relation to Brenda and in fact living on the opposite side of the world-it really is an odd and small blogosphere sometimes) replies in part as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Brenda,<br />The Chinese central bank has been buying lots of US Treasuries to help keep the dollar up and the yuan/rmb down, so that US citizens will continue to buy Chinese exports. It is that simple.</p></blockquote>
<p> With apologies to Prof. Rosser (a huge ally in the Social Security debate) I suggest that rarely is anything related to such matters &#8216;that simple&#8217;.</p>
<p>Not being an expert here I fall back on the only tools I really have. Which is to say official government data sets and a calculater. In this case I am going to start with this table which shows holdings of US Treasuries by month from Sept 2007 to Set 2008 <a href="http://www.treas.gov/tic/mfh.txt">MAJOR FOREIGN HOLDERS OF TREASURY SECURITIES</a>. And after a little examination of the numbers it would appear that the answer to Brenda&#8217;s question is not in fact &#8216;Well, duh&#8217; but instead &#8216;Well lets see if we can make sense of the actual numbers&#8217;.</p>
<p>Because as usual everything is simple if you ignore the complexities.</p>
<p>The first thing to note is that while China was indeed the largest foreign single holder of Treasuries in Sept 2008 that is actually something new, for every other month shown Japan actually held more. Nor do the numbers show that China was buying aggressively, in four of the months in the table their net holdings actually dropped. If we would have been having this discussion in July (with data through June) the answer to Brenda&#8217;s question, at least in relation to China would have been &#8216;Well not really&#8217; with Chinese holdings increasing on average $4 bn a month over a nine month period. (Social Security&#8217;s cash surplus loaned to Treasury over this period would have been about double that and its accumulated balance right at 4X that of China).</p>
<p>Still obviously China is the biggest single current player, after all in the three months from June to September they added $81 billion to their portfolio. On the other hand over that same period &#8216;Carib Banking Centers&#8217; added $63 billion to theirs, while the UK (which includes tax sheltering Channel Islands) added $58 bn. Now given banking secrecy laws in these countries it is impossible to know how much of these asset purchases were on behalf of Americans or American based MNCs, but clearly it is a number well north of zero.</p>
<p>If we proceed to look at these numbers in percentage terms China is essentially holding steady, maintaining right at 20% of all such foreign holdings. That is as the U.S. stepped up borrowing they stepped up lending but only in proportion to the new debt being issued. Nor were they getting backstopped by the rest of East Asia: Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand all reduced their holdings modestly, while Korea and Singapore held fairly steady over this period.</p>
<p>If we back up and look at who dramatially stepped up over the course of the year we get some unexpected suspects, particularly is we look at the percentage increases: UK $120 bn to $338 bn, Carib Banking $99 bn to $185 bn, Oil Exporters $137 bn to $182 bn (no surprise there), but then we have Luxembourg going from $58 bn to $91 bn, Russia from $32 bn to $70 bn, and Norway from $22 bn to $52 bn. Now some of this can be explained by oil prices but by no means all, I don&#8217;t recall that either the Caribbean or Luxembourg as being particularly dotted with oil wells. Nor would they seem to be huge net exporters to the U.S.</p>
<p>It is easy to get mesmerized by the sheer size of China and the fact that just about everything sold at WalMart (and most everywhere else) comes from East or Southeast Asia. But those who would explain everything by pointing to current trade accounts or the Chinese desire to prop up the yuan/rmbi have some explaining to do. Because there is a sea of money flowing to Treasuries (totalling up to more than 80% of the new demand) from outside Asia. And the question of how much of that money ultimately has American fingerprints on it is a good one, after all we know there are huge tax avoidance games going on, and some of that cash will inevitably end up in foreign held Treasuries.<br />___________________________<br />While I am at it can we get some overall perspective on the debt? If we visit the Treasury&#8217;s <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/NP/BPDLogin?application=np">Debt to the Penny</a> we can see the following totals:<br />Debt held by the Public $6.4 trillion<br />Intragovernment holdings $4.2 trillion<br />Total                                   $10.6 trillion  Okay that is a lot of change. On the other hand it includes some $2.3 trillion in Social Security asset/liabilities/Special Treasuries/&#8217;phony IOUs&#8217; (pick one) that will not start being redeemed until 2023. In some sense our &#8216;real debt&#8217; (that which could be dumped on the market tomorrow) is limited to that $6.4 trillion.</p>
<p>Still a lot of change. But to keep an apples to apples approach what was that number on Sept 30th? $5.8 trillion (my Hank P has been busy). How much of that was held by (ostensibly) foreign holders? $2.86 trillion. By China? $585 billion. Or 10% of all debt then held by the public, 5.5% of all total debt.</p>
<p>Frankly the notion widely promulgated over the last few years that the U.S. was hopelessly exposed to some decision by the CCB to dump Treasuries always seemed overblown. And the ability of Treasury to raise even more than that over a two month period ($5.8 trillion to $6.4 trillion since Sept 30th) seems to have proved the point. I am not so naive as to believe that the world will continue to effectively lend money to the U.S. for returns that are effectively negative for unlimited periods of time. But I do suggest that to reduce everything to the Current Trade balance with China and the willingness of the PRC to prop up exports by buying dollars is just that: reductionism that does in fact ignore the complexities, in part by not putting the numbers in context.</p>

<blockquote><p>Take Rep. Brad Sherman (D-California), a bailout critic.  During debate over the bailout bill that passed the House Friday, he said of the previous bill that had failed, &#8220;Many of us were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday that the sky would fall, the market would drop 2000-3000 points the first day, another couple thousand the second day, and a few members were even told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Is Sherman engaging in hyperbole here?  I daresay that&#8217;s not the point.  The mere possibility he&#8217;s not engaging in hyperbole should send a chill down our spines.</p></blockquote>
<p>Remember this note on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/martial-law-declared-for-other.html">Martial law</a> and the last part of the national security update stating &#8220;..and other conditions.&#8221;  Has this little bit been changed?</p>
