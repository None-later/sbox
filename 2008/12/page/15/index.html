                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/11/16/a_healthcare_system_badly_out_of_balance/?p1=Well_MostPop_Emailed1">Boston Globe</a> has uncovered data showing that the amount insurance companies reimburse hospitals in Massachusetts can vary dramatically from hospital to hospital.</p>
<blockquote><p> Private insurance data obtained by the Globe&#8217;s Spotlight Team show that the Brigham [&#038; Women&#8217;s Hospital], Mass[achsetts] General, Children&#8217;s Hospital[, all in Boston,] and a few others are, on average, paid about 15 percent to 60 percent more than their rivals by insurance companies such as Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The gap is even more striking for many individual procedures, which can be two or three times more expensive in one hospital than in another.</p>
<p>A driving (but not the only) force behind this, the Globe reports, is Partners Health Care, originally formed as an alliance between Brigham and Mass General &#8211; both among the nation&#8217;s top 10 hospitals according the US News &#038; World Report&#8217;s annual listing &#8211; to combat what the founders saw as the stinginess of insurance companies. Their prominence allowed them to tell the insurance companies, in effect, &#8220;pay us what we say or else&#8221; &#8211; the &#8220;or else&#8221; being that if a company balked, the hospitals would refuse to accept their insurance, which could cost the company thousands of subscribers panicking at the thought of being denied access to those top-drawer facilities. One company that tried to resist &#8211; Tufts Health Plan &#8211; caved within days.</p>
<p>The result is that Partners Health Care hospitals, overall and on average, get paid 30% more for the same services as non-affiliated hospitals.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that these differences in no way correlate with quality of care and they persist even in cases not only of identical procedures using identical equipment but treatment by identical physicians &#8211; the only difference being what hospital their patient is in. In fact, sometimes the correlation is negative:</p>
<p>    Massachusetts General Hospital, for example, earns 15 percent more than Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for treating heart-failure patients even though government figures show that Beth Israel has for years reported lower patient death rates.</p>
<p>Simply put, price does not equal quality. What it does equal is profit: Partners has netted $1.7 billion over the past few years.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this has done two things: shift the center of power in the health care industry in Massachusetts somewhat from the insurance companies toward the hospitals and drive up the cost of health insurance in the state. What it decidedly has not done is improve the quality of health care.</p>
<p>Nor has it improved access to health care; indeed, it may well have damaged it: Massachusetts requires that everyone in the state have health insurance and offers subsidized insurance to those who can&#8217;t otherwise afford it. Rising premiums in the private market means more people who can&#8217;t afford the cost, throwing them back on the state system, raising its cost and inhibiting the goal of universal coverage.</p></blockquote>

<p>Revisiting an Early Look at the Recession</p>
<p>Now that the recession is officially here, I&#8217;d like to revisit a post I wrote in March entitled <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/how-is-this-recession-not-like-other.html">How is This Recession Not Like Other Recessions?</a>.  </p>
<p>In it, I note the following:</p>
<blockquote><p>So in terms of politics&#8230; what we see is that the Fed is much more likely to cut real M1 by a lot when there&#8217;s a Dem in office, and the economy has been much, much more likely to make it through such a cut in real M1 without suffering a recession when a Dem is in office. The end result, of course, is that the percentage of time that the economy is in recession when the President is a Republican is much higher than the percentage of time that the economy is in recession when the President is a Democrat.</p>
<p>Now, back to the current mess&#8230; since every single one of the seven previous recessions for which we can compute real M1 using data on the Fed&#8217;s website was preceded by a cut of 3.5% or more in the three month real M1, the natural question is&#8230;. is that true this time too? As with many things involving GW, the answer is&#8230; No. If there&#8217;s one recession that wasn&#8217;t at last partly triggered by the Fed, this one is it.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is not to say that the Fed wasn&#8217;t partly at fault for creating the messy conditions, but it did not trigger the recession by shrinking the real money supply in the year leading up to the recession&#8217;s start, unlike every other recession since 1959, the first year for which data on M1 is available on the Fed&#8217;s website.   Put another way &#8211; the cause of this recession is if not unique, its certainly extraordinary in the past few decades.  And if its not a contraction in the money supply that&#8217;s causing this, then its something &#8220;real.&#8221;  When the problem is a contraction in M1, well, the fix simply involves re-inflating the money supply.  But something else has to happen when the recession is caused by something &#8220;real&#8221; &#8211; the &#8220;real&#8221; problem has to be fixed.   One thing that ain&#8217;t gonna fix it is throwing money at Goldman, Welfare, Queen &#038; Sachs &#8211; its not Goldman&#8217;s problems that precipitated the recession, after all.  The economy had slowed down long before anyone realized what a hash the investment banks and AIG had made of their business.</p>
<p>So how long is this recession going to last?  I really hope not long.  But what if the problem really is the fact that the US economy doesn&#8217;t produce much any more, and houses are way overvalued?  I sure hope we don&#8217;t have to wait until those problems are fixed.</p>
<p>The post also had something else that I like:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which leads to my question from yesterday&#8217;s post, yet again &#8211; why are we seeing a recession now, at this time, so soon after the last one. The last time we see a recession so soon after the previous one, Reagan was in office. The last time we saw a President with two recessions in his term, Nixon was in office. Unless the last few decades have been a major aberration, an ordinary business cycle shouldn&#8217;t be bringing us to a recession so soon. So to repeat: why are we seeing a recession now, given that GW has gotten everything he&#8217;s wanted &#8211; tax cuts, help from the Fed, reduced regulation, even two wars (and remember &#8211; Conservatives and libertarians credit WW2 with ending the recession, not FDR)? Could the conservative or libertarian model have predicted such a thing? </p></blockquote>

                                <p>By Stormy</p>
<p>In Canada, all hell is breaking loose.</p>
<p>A newly form coalition of Liberals, NDP and the Bloc Québécois is challenging the recently elected conservative Harper minority government. The last time a coalition tried to wrest power from a sitting government&#8211;without resorting to a no-confidence vote that would lead to new elections&#8211;is over ninety years ago.</p>
<p>Harper, of course, is crying foul, but even some in his own party are suggesting he step down.</p>
<p>The coalition is a strange one. Stephane Dion, the head of the Liberal party, weakened by a disastrous election effort, is stepping down in May; consequently, if the coalition succeeds, he will be Prime Minister for only a few months. (Dion is not a very effective campaigner or spokesman.) The Bloc has its roots in a movement to declare Quebec independent. Huh, you say? The New Democrat Party have always been at war with the Liberals for Canada&#8217;s left. Together, the coalition represents over sixty percent of Canada.</p>
<p>That such a coalition would form to oust a sitting Canadian government is very, very rare&#8211;and not done in haste. Having just been through an election, the coalition is not anxious to put the country through another major election so soon after the last one.</p>
<p>So what happened to bring all this about?</p>
<p>One word: Harper.</p>
<p>He is a Bush-lite, a twig off the neo-conservative branch.</p>
<p>As an American living in Canada, I kept telling my wife (Canadian) that Harper is bad news for Canada.</p>
<p>A control-freak, he runs the government exactly like the neo-cons here. No one talks unless they read the right script.</p>
<p>The well coiffed Harper made a strategic and fatal mistake. Thinking that the other parties would never work together, he initially tried to take away their funding. (Political party subsidies are based on the number of votes received during elections.)</p>
<p>Harper was making a grab for real and permanent power. Seeing his error, he retracted the proposal. Too late. The monster had been unmasked.</p>
<p>In the background, were Harper&#8217;s corporate masters, ready to provide all the funding the conservatives would ever need. Sound like the U.S.? Indeed it does.</p>
<p>Already the other parties were dismayed at the Harper government&#8217;s failure to offer a stimulus package to assist the auto and forestry industries.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are deep suspicions that Harper would criminalize <a href="http://network.nationalpost.com/np/blogs/posted/archive/2008/09/29/harper-majority-could-re-criminalize-abortion-bq.aspx">abortions</a>, despite Harper&#8217;s protestations to the contrary. And then there is the &#8220;three-strikes and you are out&#8221; proposal and the failure to support child care for working women. And then there are the corporate tax cuts that many claim will just make the rich richer. All of which should sound familiar to Americans.</p>
<p>For those Americans who think Canada is just America&#8217;s little twin brother, think again. Canada has a real and living social safety net.</p>
<p>There are deep suspicions that Harper will try to undo it.</p>
<p>The question now is: Will Harper succeed in holding onto power? And if the coalition succeeds, will it govern successfully?</p>
<p>Harper&#8217;s counter attack is two-fold: Buy time and appeal to the electorate that all of this is unconstitutional. Then, by attacking the Bloc as an absurd coalition partner, try to divide and conquer. After all, the Bloc is a separatist movement. (Or is it, really?)</p>
<p>In short, pit the English speaking electorate against French Quebec. In making such an attack, Harper is risking the unity that is essential to Canadian well-being.</p>
<p>There really is no darkness to which this pretty-boy, scalawag will not descend.</p>

                                <p>UPDATE:  Credit where due category:  H/T to <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/12/01/extra-credit-monday-edition?tid=true">Felix Salmon</a> for pointing to <a href="http://wcw.bignose.org/index.php?/archives/333-Oh,-jeepers.html">this chart at bignose.org</a>, which gives you borrowings relative to GDP.</p>
<p>I often hate line graphs, especially when they include outliers that skew the axis, making it virtually unreadable. (This may be a result of seeing several papers this semester with Chilean/US$ exchange rates on a graphic from ca. 1970 forward.)</p>
<p>But this objection is because the historic outlier smoothes the view of current data.  It doesn&#8217;t apply when you&#8217;re living through the outliers.  And now that NBER has called the start of the recession, let&#8217;s look at some of the evidence. The following three graphics are of two serieses from the Fed&#8217;s <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/release?rid=19&#038;soid=1">H.3 Aggregate Reserves data</a>, available from <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/">FRED</a>.</p>
<p>First, let&#8217;s look at the longest period possible, January 1929*-November 2007:
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/STWb14Spo4I/AAAAAAAAAOk/FRo5Uz2K0C4/s1600-h/Borrowings+and+Reserves+1929-Nov+2007.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/STWb14Spo4I/AAAAAAAAAOk/FRo5Uz2K0C4/s400/Borrowings+and+Reserves+1929-Nov+2007.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The Very Noticeable post-WW II increase of the Blue Line (Excess Reserves) is September, 2001.  I think we can generally agree that the two-week period in the middle of the month during which very little shopping was done may have had something to do with it.</p>
<p>The rather high (per this graphic, defined loosely as > US$2B) Depository Borrowings are generally May to November of 1984 and April to November of 1988.  Whether these have anything to do with the election is left as an exercise.  (The pattern is not repeated in 1992 or later.)  There are other noticeable high periods—basically, the last months of Richard Nixon&#8217;s Presidency (May-Sep 1974) and a few months scattered from October 1979 to June of 1981, and a couple of subsequent outliers, but the Borrowings are generally below US$2B for the month until December of 2007.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at the current century, January 2001-October 2008:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/STWcDpZW5TI/AAAAAAAAAOs/PWIFD97fr6o/s1600-h/Borrowings+and+Reserves+January+2001+October+2008.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/STWcDpZW5TI/AAAAAAAAAOs/PWIFD97fr6o/s400/Borrowings+and+Reserves+January+2001+October+2008.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>What was a noticeable Crisis Point on the previous graph is now a small bump in the road to Reserve Hell.  The scale for Borrowings has gone from peaking at US$9B to US$700B.  The scale of Excess Reserves has gone from peaking around US$20B to US$300B—all during the period since the Recession started.</p>
<p>And, just because I&#8217;m a cruel person, let&#8217;s zoom in on the Recession itself: the past thirteen months of data, October 2007 &#8211; October 2008:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/STWc6Suxi-I/AAAAAAAAAO0/I8DWhtdo1UU/s1600-h/Borrowings+and+Reserves+October+2007+October+2008.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/STWc6Suxi-I/AAAAAAAAAO0/I8DWhtdo1UU/s400/Borrowings+and+Reserves+October+2007+October+2008.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The scariest thing about this graphic is the reason it&#8217;s on two axes.  Note that it is even clearer from this graphic the borrowings from the Fed are <em>far in excess</em> of the Excess Reserves. (Don&#8217;t let the narrowing fool you; the slope of the scale of the Borrowings is condensed much more than the scale of the Reserves.</p>
<p>In fact, if we look at the data, December 2007 is the point at which Borrowings first exceeds Reserves.  A semi-helpful graphic of the difference:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/STWkXY-DL2I/AAAAAAAAAO8/Tx31RAKvmnU/s1600-h/Borrowings+less+Reserves+September+2007+October+2008.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/STWkXY-DL2I/AAAAAAAAAO8/Tx31RAKvmnU/s400/Borrowings+less+Reserves+September+2007+October+2008.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>For October and November, there are over US$1B more Reserves than there are Borrowings.  We would be able to see that, except that in December of 2007 there are US$13B more in Borrowings, by April of 2008 the number exceeds US$100B, and it has basically been increasing ever since.**</p>
<p>There may be a few institutions out there lending, but they appear to be doing it primarily with borrowed funds.</p>
<p>*Month chosen because that is where the Excess Reserves data starts being measured. Depository Borrowings starts in 1919.</p>
<p>**There is a slight decline from June (ca. 169) to July (ca. 163.7), possibly due to  tax rebate processing; by September, the excess is over US$200B and it soared in October to over US$380B.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Projecting the long-term health of Social Security is of necessity subject to uncertainty, the known unknowns if you will. But you can if you like sample the short term health by consulting Treasury&#8217;s <a href="http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/tfmp/tfmp.htm">Monthly Trust Fund Reports</a> which gives balances to the penny with a one month lag, and compare them to the various projections of the 2008 Report. If it appears that the balances are coming in ahead of standard Intermediate Cost projections you can conclude that the outlook is by that amount better than expected. If those balances are coming in ahead of (fully funded) Low Cost then you have a limited reason to claim there may be no shortfall at all. On the other hand if the numbers look to not quite making it to IC levels then you want to pay some attention.</p>
<p>So how is Social Security holding up in the face of a recession now officially a year old? Well, looks like we need to pay some attention.</p>
<p>The 2008 Report projected that the year end balance in the OAS (Old Age/Survivors) Trust Fund would be:<br />Intermediate Cost $2.216 trillion and Low Cost $2.221 trillion up from a starting balance of $2.023 trillion</p>
<p>Actual numbers:<br />June (half year) $2.140 trillion<br />Aug (2/3rd)    $2.164 trillion<br />Sept (Q3)        $2.177 trillion<br />Oct                  $2.187 trillion</p>
<p>In June OAS had a balance up $117 bn from starting, if July to Dec simply duplicated that we would have a year end balance of $2.257 trillion or significantly ahead of even Low Cost numbers. But even then anyone who was paying attention knew there was trouble ahead and as things are playing out we will be lucky to end up within $10 billion of Intermediate Cost and so $15 billion from Low Cost. Not the best news but in perspective it means that our portfolio would only increase by 95% of expectations. (Note that this still translates to a big surplus for 2008, just not as big as we hoped.)</p>
<p>How did DI (Disability Insurance) fare? Well this is a real interesting story. Projections:<br />Intermediate Cost $219 billion and Low Cost $221 billion up from a starting balance of $214 billion</p>
<p>Actual numbers:<br />June (half year) $220 billion<br />Aug (2/3rd)    $219 billion<br />Sept (Q3)        $219 billion<br />Oct                  $218 billion</p>
<p>At mid-year things were looking pretty good, already the balance was up by some $6 billion and already beating IC projections. Certainly adding another billion and so matching Low Cost by year&#8217;s end in principle was in reach. Except for those pesky numbers in the business pages. Not only is DI not adding to its balance in the second half of the year, it is losing a good part of the progress made in the first half.</p>
<p>What does all of this mean? Well on my reading it shows that Social Security is a pretty robust system. And this makes certain sense, an increase in unemployment that puts hundreds of thousands of people out of work (say from 5% to 6%) is from another perspective just over 1% of all covered hours (94%/95% = 1.1%). This doesn&#8217;t mean we want to keep throwing these employment numbers at Social Security for an extended period of time, though I have never had much reason to discuss the more pessimistic High Cost scenario it like Low Cost is &#8216;out there&#8217; and we are openly flirting with it right now. But even High Cost looks pretty good when your 401k is 40% plus off its peak.</p>

<p>My Essential Blogs</p>
<p>Most of us who read blogs have blogs we read regularly.  Of those, there might be a handful we consider essential.  That list is different for each of us, and no doubt changes over time for each of us.</p>
<p>Last week, I learned what my current list of essential blogs is, as I was traveling outside of the country and often had only sporadic access to the net.  As I said, I often read quite a few others, but when I had a mere five minutes, this is the list I made sure I perused:</p>
<p>1.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/">Angry Bear</a>.  Granted, I&#8217;m biased, but I think Rdan has assembled one heck of a crew and made this is into a great destination.<br />2.  <a href="http://tbogg.firedoglake.com/">TBogg</a>.  Not economics at all, at least usually not, but when he&#8217;s on, the eponymous TBogg is simply the best writer on the internet if you ask me. <br />3.  <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/">Naked Capitalism</a>.   I don&#8217;t know how Yves Smith does it.  I simply don&#8217;t. <br />4.  <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/">Calculated Risk</a>.  Tanta&#8217;s death is a loss &#8211; few people understood the mortgage banking business and had the talent and the opportunity to write about it to boot.  I&#8217;m going to miss her writing.  But Calculated Risk will one of the best places to get very complex, relevant, and information explained in an easy-to-understand and timely manner because of its founder.</p>
<p>By the way, before going on with this list, I should note that I&#8217;ve had occasion to correspond a couple times with Yves Smith and Calculated Risk.  Both are as friendly and helpful as they are smart and incisive.  I had one exchange with TBogg too, and he was quite friendly too. </p>
<p>Continuing with the list:</p>
<p>5.  <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">Krugman</a>.  I haven&#8217;t always agreed with him (and on occasion, I&#8217;ve been right when I disagreed with him), and on occasion I&#8217;ve been very critical, but when it comes to being clear, incisive, and cutting to the chase, Krugman is the best.<br />6.  <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press">Beat the Press</a>.  Dean Baker is very, very good. <br />7.  <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/">Marginal Revolution</a>.  Alex Tabarrok and Tyler Cowen are smart, informative, and entertaining.  And they often come at things from an angle I wasn&#8217;t considering.<br />8.  <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/">Economist&#8217;s View</a>.  Mark Thoma is another one man shop who manage to produce way more than I can imagine a person producing.  And his daily links are excellent. <br />9.  <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/">Eschaton</a>.  Atrios&#8217; unashamedly liberal news blog is a great round-up of the days events.<br />10.  <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/">Washington Monthly&#8217;s Political Animal</a>.  This was a great blog when Kevin Drum ran it.  Somehow, its even better now &#8211; Hilzoy and Steven Benen make this, in my opinion, the best single source for political analysis on the web. </p>
<p>So there&#8217;s my essential list.  I try to read more blogs than that most days, and many of the ones I read have a different bias.  But these are the ones I read when that&#8217;s all I have time for.  What&#8217;s your list?</p>
<p>The loss of Tanta is a blow to the blogosphere, but even by himself CR does one heck of a job.<br />________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2008/11/21/small_business_loans_still_flowing/">Boston Globe</a> reports on local conditions for small businesses: </p>
<blockquote><p>Even as consumer loans become harder to get, many small businesses in Massachusetts report they are still able to borrow money.</p>
<p>In Franklin, Stephen Dunn, president of design and manufacturing firm Core Concepts Inc., says Benjamin Franklin Bank has invited him to renew his $1 million line of credit. In Woburn, Mike Jenoski, president of Duplication Management Inc., a printing and Web services company, says Enterprise Bank is encouraging him to borrow to expand his business. And in Jamaica Plain, Katherine Mainzer, co-owner of Bella Luna Restaurant and the Milky Way Lounge, says she is about to close on a $360,000 loan from Citizens Bank to relocate.</p>
<p>While Mainzer, like other small business owners, is worried about the slumping economy, &#8220;We didn&#8217;t see a clampdown&#8221; in lending, she said.</p>
<p>In fact, Massachusetts trade groups and bank executives report a continued flow of borrowing by small businesses, despite the credit crisis that has slowed other lending such as consumer auto loans and mortgages.</p>
<p>Among the 18 publicly traded banks in Massachusetts that have reported their earnings through Sept. 30, 12 said the total value of their loans increased 5.9 percent or more this year, compared with just five banks at the same point a year ago, according to a preliminary analysis by Milton bank analyst Suzanne Moot.</p>
<p>Five reported loan growth above 10 percent, including Danvers Bancorp at 13.3 percent and Enterprise Bank of Lowell at 11.9 percent. Much of the growth is the result of lending to small businesses, executives say.</p>
<p>Moot said it&#8217;s difficult to draw broader conclusions about local lending until the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. reports more specific figures for the state next week. Some business borrowers and lenders concede that loan terms have tightened, with banks raising interest rates or demanding more collateral.</p>
<p>Still, the reports filed by the publicly traded banks provide a counterpoint to the national concern that businesses can&#8217;t borrow because banks are hoarding their cash, Moot said. &#8220;All the data we&#8217;ve got doesn&#8217;t point to a slowdown in lending,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Nationally, some economists have made similar points. In a paper last month for the Minneapolis Federal Reserve, three economists said bank credit continued to rise, at least through Oct. 15, as have the total amounts of loans and leases.</p>
<p>But Harvard Business School professors Victoria Ivashina and David Scharfstein said in their own paper that loan totals are growing partly because companies are drawing down previously arranged lines of credit. Also, several economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston wrote this month that the amount of loans banks keep on their balance sheets is growing because they can no longer sell loans to be packaged into other securities.</p>
<p>Still, local business executives aren&#8217;t complaining they can&#8217;t get credit, or even that bank terms are too tight, said Brian Gilmore, executive vice president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, a trade group representing 7,000 companies in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>&#8220;The whole psychology is that the sky is falling, even though it&#8217;s not,&#8221; Gilmore said.</p>
<p>Executives at Boston accounting and consulting firm Vitale, Caturano &#038; Co. say the biggest impact of the financial crisis on lending so far is that banks are inspecting company books more closely before agreeing to make loans. &#8220;You feel like at least so far we&#8217;re ducking a lot of the national issues,&#8221; said Jeff Korzenik, Vitale Caturano&#8217;s chief investment officer.</p>
<p>Some economists and bankers say smaller banks are picking up customers who aren&#8217;t top priorities for big banks, which are grappling with subprime mortgages and other problems in their loan portfolios.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.thomaspalley.com/?p=144#more-144">Thomas Palley</a> has a good take on the consequences of allowing the Big Three to disappear: Their disappearance not only may end any hopes of our closing our enormous trade deficit, but also may trigger a perfect economic storm.<br />
<blockquote>Moreover, the automakers are essential for closing the trade deficit, and their demise could bring another surge in imports. The automakers are also the backbone of American manufacturing, driving advances in manufacturing technology that will be needed if America is to be a world leader in the coming “green” transportation revolution. Additionally, the Big Three are vital to national security, supplying important military transportation assets. Lastly, bankruptcy will impose massive costs on the government’s Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), potentially undermining its financial stability.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Big Three are already &#8220;huge debtors&#8221;<br />
<blockquote>whose liabilities are held throughout the financial system. If they go bankrupt, the insurance industry, which is likely a large holder of these debts may quickly enter a spiral of collapse. Pension funds will also be hit, imposing further costs on corporations and households at a time when they are already financially stressed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore,<br />
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;the greatest damage may come from the credit default swaps (CDS) market that brought down AIG. Huge bets have undoubtedly been placed on the bonds of GM, Ford, Chrysler, and GMAC, and bankruptcy will be a CDS triggering event requiring repayment of these bonds. Moreover, a Big Three bankruptcy will bankrupt other companies, risking a cascade of financial damage as their bonds and equities fall in value and further CDS events are triggered. This is the nightmare outcome that risks replicating the Crash of 1929. </p>
<p>There are undoubtedly colossal problems in Detroit, and the bosses of the Big Three automakers could never be convicted of an excess of imagination. Economic policy has also contributed to their current condition as trade agreements and an over-valued dollar promoted auto imports, and incoherent energy and environmental policy stifled innovation. </p>
<p>All of this must be fixed. But sacrificing the Big Three automakers will accomplish nothing while risking a tragic economic depression</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are no easy answers any more. We have undoubtably backed ourselves into a corner, with thoughtless tax policies for the rich, incoherent tax policies that might have guided our economic development, and a complete disregard for our manufacturing sector as we celebrated our miserable and miserly banking system that has skimmed, scammed, and leveraged its way to disaster.</p>
