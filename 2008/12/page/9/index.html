<p><a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/12/neoliberalism-down-under.html">Summary:</a></p>
<p>The two best examples of neoliberalism working are Australia and New<br />Zealand. These two nations (of which I am a citizen of one) enacted<br />major economic reforms in the early 1980s and have benefited since.</p>
<p>The Washington Consensus, despite being out of fashion these days, is a<br />blueprint that both Australia and New Zealand have followed and it has<br />brought them better economic security than what they were experiencing<br />beforehand.</p>
<p>Naturally, such economic changes came at a price, and many mistakes were<br />made and many people&#8217;s lives badly affected. The net result, however,<br />has been positive. Moreover, these economic changes have occurred side<br />by side with universal health care and a generous pension system.</p>
<p>What America has experienced since Reagan has not been neoliberalism.<br />Had Washington followed the Washington Consensus, the economic crisis<br />now being experienced would probably not have occurred.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />Quotes:</p>
<p>Of course, I am Australian, and so I am biased in many ways towards my<br />own country&#8217;s economic achievements over the years. Moreover, I am<br />realistic as well &#8211; market reform has not been all good and many people,<br />especially the poor, are worse off as a result. Workplace Reform,<br />undertaken by the Howard Government in its later years, was also deeply<br />unpopular with ordinary people and eventually led to his electoral<br />defeat in 2007.</p>
<p>Yet there is one thing which you can say about neoliberalism in<br />Australia and New Zealand &#8211; it worked, and continues to work. The<br />Washington Consensus, now so out of fashion, was the blueprint for<br />Australia&#8217;s and New Zealand&#8217;s success. Fiscal prudence, deregulation,<br />removal of subsidies and trade barriers, positive real interest rates,<br />privatisation of government enterprises &#8211; all these things have been the<br />basis of economic reform in these two nations.</p>
<p>And yet the neoliberalism experienced by these two nations never moved<br />into supply-side stupidity or a strong pro market ideology. Both<br />Australia and New Zealand continue to have universal health care and a<br />generous pension system to help those who cannot help themselves. The<br />neoliberalism experienced was thus more centrist than right wing.</p>
<p>For us here in Australia, the term &#8220;deregulation&#8221; means to free up a<br />sector of the economy to allow market forces to dominate what is<br />produced and at what price. In America, however, &#8220;deregulation&#8221; means a<br />continual relaxation of laws to allow businesses to become more<br />profitable while having less regulations holding them back, such as<br />safety and environmental laws. The difference is obvious &#8211; Down under,<br />deregulation was &#8220;market friendly&#8221; and takes into account various<br />stakeholders while in the US, deregulation was &#8220;business friendly&#8221; and<br />only helps one or more companies. There is a world of difference between<br />the two &#8211; the former allowing the market to work effectively, the latter<br />being a form of &#8220;you scratch my back I&#8217;ll scratch yours&#8221; mentality.</p>
<p>The current economic crisis will inevitably drive America away from its<br />ideological and fiscally irresponsible actions. That is good. But what<br />will replace it? The populist solution &#8211; and one which is increasingly<br />being touted by American economists and econ-bloggers &#8211; is to renege on<br />the principles of free trade and to abandon neoliberal principles and<br />such things as the Washington Consensus for&#8230; whatever Obama and<br />congress will do presumably.<br />____________________________________<br />by reader OSO</p>

<p>Questions About the Big 3, and Legacy Costs</p>
<p>I keep hearing that the Big 3&#8217;s <bold>Problem</bold> is that it has all these legacy union retirees who are expensive as all heck to maintain and add tremendously to the cost of manufacturing cars.  That raises a few questions:</p>
<p>1.  How many years will it be before Honda and Toyota and BMW and other foreign manufacturers who make vehicles in the US have burdensome legacy retiree costs of their own?  <br />2.  If there are new entrants into the market when these companies are burdened by legacy retiree costs, won&#8217;t these companies which we currently laud as efficient be disadvantaged relative to new entrants then?  Is this an endless cycle until such a point as nobody offers retirement benefits?<br />3.  Honda and Toyota and BMW and the rest of &#8217;em offer retirement benefits to workers in their own home countries.  A part of the reason their home-country retirees aren&#8217;t considered such a big burden on these companies is that the state covers the bulk of the retirement costs for their former employees.  <br />4.  Given 2. and 3., are the only options no retirement benefits, or benefits covered by the state?  <br />_____________________________________________<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>Look no further than some of the brain-dead idiocy suggested as part of <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/12/the-ideal-stimulus-package/">this NY Times poll of economists</a>.  Saddest quote of the day is from Andrew Samwick, who decided to be stupid the day the U.S. elected a non-Republican president:<br />
<blockquote>“If I had my druthers, the word ’stimulus’ would be expunged from public discussion, along with ‘bailout’ and ‘rescue.’ These words convey the idea that, because we have so mismanaged our economic and financial affairs, we are somehow able or entitled to conjure up additional funds out of thin air to fix our problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>Samwick does at least close his ranting with some sensible proposals, instead of the idiocy from Andrew Roth, who lies with impunity because the NYT is stupid enough to let him do so:<br />
<blockquote>“The best way to spend $500 billion would be to permanently eliminate the corporate income tax&#8230;.It would instantly increase asset valuations like 401(k)’s, I.R.A.’s, and homes, which have been hemorrhaging in value over the last several months.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s right.  The solution to the 30% decline in housing prices and that 40% decline in your 401(k) is bankrupting the country and letting your grandchildren pay for it.</p>

<p>Pulled from comments (to the Librarian post at Eschaton):<br />
<blockquote>[W]ithout economic knowledge, DFHs don&#8217;t understand why the bailout of banks so that they would keep credit flowing is critical, while the bailout of the auto industry caused by the fact that the banks spent the money on acquisitions and executive pay instead of lending it, is not critical.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which leads us to the reality that the problem is the dealer contracts, since <a href="http://cabdrollery.blogspot.com/2008/12/yes-they-could.html">GM in Brazil is gaining market share</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Nonetheless, GM here in Brazil is faring well among the other three giants, Fiat, Volkswagen and Ford. According to the latest numbers, GM sold 444,000 automobiles in Brazil from January to November. This is a 10.4% increase from the same time period last year. In the light commercial segment, which saw 76,000 units sold, there was an impressive growth of 60% again in the same period. Here, Chevrolet continues to be a respectful brand. Also, like other assembly plants installed in Brazil, flex cars already dominate a substantial part of production at GM.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s easier to rely on Flex Cars when you&#8217;re using a useful source for ethanol, instead of corn. (See Tom&#8217;s multiple postings on the subject, both <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?domains=angrybear.blogspot.com&#038;q=ethanol+Bozzo&#038;sa=Google+Search&#038;sitesearch=angrybear.blogspot.com&#038;client=pub-7495486645615446&#038;forid=1&#038;channel=2832893407&#038;ie=ISO-8859-1&#038;oe=ISO-8859-1&#038;cof=GALT%3A%23008000%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3BVLC%3A663399%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BLBGC%3A336699%3BALC%3A0000FF%3BLC%3A0000FF%3BT%3A000000%3BGFNT%3A0000FF%3BGIMP%3A0000FF%3BFORID%3A1&#038;hl=en">here</a> and <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&#038;as_q=&#038;as_epq=&#038;as_oq=ethanol+E85&#038;as_eq=&#038;num=10&#038;lr=&#038;as_filetype=&#038;ft=i&#038;as_sitesearch=atbozzo.blogspot.com&#038;as_qdr=all&#038;as_rights=&#038;as_occt=any&#038;cr=&#038;as_nlo=&#038;as_nhi=&#038;safe=images">at MU</a>.)</p>
<p>And about those workers who (foolishly, per Senators who are paid much more than $73/hour, even if you pretend they work &#8220;full-time&#8221;) accepted the companies promises of a pension and health benefits in place of being paid?  Well, Malcolm Gladwell had the data <strong><em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/08/28/060828fa_fact?printable=true">over a year ago</a></em></strong>:<br />
<blockquote>Walter Reuther&#8230;believed that risk ought to be broadly collectivized. Charlie Wilson, on the other hand, felt the way the business leaders of Toledo did: that collectivization was a threat to the free market and to the autonomy of business owners. In his view, companies themselves ought to assume the risks of providing insurance.</p>
<p>General Motors, the country’s largest automaker, is between forty and fifty billion dollars behind in the money it needs to fulfill its health-care and pension promises. This crisis is sometimes portrayed as the result of corporate America’s excessive generosity in making promises to its workers. But when it comes to retirement, health, disability, and unemployment benefits there is nothing exceptional about the United States: it is average among industrialized countries—more generous than Australia, Canada, Ireland, and Italy, just behind Finland and the United Kingdom, and on a par with the Netherlands and Denmark. The difference is that in most countries the government, or large groups of companies, provides pensions and health insurance. The United States, by contrast, has over the past fifty years followed the lead of Charlie Wilson and the bosses of Toledo and made individual companies responsible for the care of their retirees. It is this fact, as much as any other, that explains the current crisis. In 1950, Charlie Wilson was wrong, and Walter Reuther was right.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other news, Canada <a href="http://www.cp24.com/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20081212/081212_cda_auto/20081212/?hub=CP24Home">is still whipping U.S. bum</a>, and we don&#8217;t even have a government right now.</p>

<p>gives advice to libertarians, free market fanatics and Republicans on how to blame the financial crisis on government regulation.</p>
<p>Quite frankly, their efforts so far have been pathetic &#8212; Let&#8217;s pretend that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac lead the way in sub-prime mortgages which were orginally defined as mortgages that they wouldn&#8217;t touch.   Let&#8217;s blame the Community Reinvestment Act which does not apply to non bank mortgage lenders and even though the default rate for CRA covered mortgages is lower than the over all average.  The &#8220;Barack Obama is an atheist Moslem born outside the USA&#8221; people have better arguments.</p>
<p>So, being moved to pity, I have some advice.  Look up <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basel_II">Basel II on Wikipedia</a>.  Then click till you get to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_approach_(credit_risk)">Standardized Approach (Credit Risk)</a> and you will find a candidate for the source of the trouble.  </p>
<p>There are capital requirements by type of debtor and then as a function of ratings from AAA down to &#8220;below B-&#8220;.</p>
<p>Now my knowledge is vague recollections of things I read here and there plus the Wikipedia.  I don&#8217;t know to what extent ratings by rating agencies count for actual regulations under the Basel II framework.  They can&#8217;t have the force of law and, I would guess, that national regulators can over-rule them and issue corrected ratings.  However, I would also guess that they are very reluctant to do so.</p>
<p>One page back at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standardized_approach">Standardized Approach</a> </p>
<p>You will read </p>
<blockquote><p>The Basel Accord proposes to permit banks a choice between two broad methodologies for calculating their capital requirements for credit risk. One alternative is to measure credit risk in a standardised manner, supported by external credit assessments. The other alternative is based on internal ratings.</p>
<p>The approach supported by external credit assessment is known as standardized approach (credit risk).</p></blockquote>
<p>So the standardized approach is an option.</p>
<p>Now in my earlier post on the credit ratings game, many commenters said of course the agencies are frauds.  That was not the puzzle.  The puzzle is why were they so credible for so long.  The ratings were taken very very seriously.  In fact actual defaults were well predicted by lagged ratings. Now not so much.  For years there have been systematic differences in the price of different intstruments with the same rating.  Also highly rated instruments have defaulted.  What changed ?  </p>
<p>I&#8217;d look into the Lucas critique &#8212; when policy makers assume that an empirical relationship is a natural law and attempt to exploit it, it disappears.  In particular the usefulness to private agents of the ratings caused regulators to decide to use them too (and destroy them) via Basel II.</p>
<p>Regulations change things.  Now ratings such as AAA are no longer mere communicative acts whose value depends entirely on whether investors believe the.  Now those three letters appear in a proposed regulatory framework.  A bank that doesn&#8217;t believe an instrument is worthy of an AAA rating can still choose to hold that instrument in order to keep its requried capital low.  Any instrument that clears the AAA bar with room to spare has wasted safeness which is not being used leveraging up as much as possible.  </p>
<p>Now that innaccurate ratings are useful to the private sector in its never ending quest to suck more money out of the public sector in expected bailouts, the former opponents in the ratings game become team mates.   Issuing firms, the agencies and investing banks subject to Basel II all want high ratings &#8212; just for different reasons.  This can explain why ratings agencies gave AAA ratings to the most senior tranches of re-pooled and re-tranched mezzanine tranches of CDOs, why S&#038;P had a MBS risk assessment program which would not simulate outcomes for any negative change in the average US house price index.  This explains how new assets which didn&#8217;t exist last recession could be rated AAA etc etc etc.</p>
<p>With a mix of players some regulated by Basel II and some not, the return on the most risky bonds of a given rating is lower than it would be (the price is higher) than without Basel II.  However, it is still higher than the return of safer bonds, because not all concern about risk is avoidance of capital requirements.</p>
<p>This explains who held the &#8220;Super Senior Tranche.&#8221;  US investment banks (not subject to Basel II) kept tranches senior to AAA rated tranches on their books.  Here I think both the Basel II regulated and non Basel II regulated banks can gain higher returns until the crash comes by making just barely AAA rated securities for Basel II regulated banks (so they can hold as little capital as possible for the risk and return they get) and have non Basel II regulated banks hold the wasted safety (and low returns) of the better than barely AAA tranches.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve read explanations of the value of unconvincing ratings.  They are based on principal agent issues and rules imposed by principles on the managers of pension funds and endowments.  Helping an agent cheat his or her principal is a way to make money which leads to crises and waste.  I don&#8217;t see anything especially problematic if the principal is an official lender of last resort or deposit insurer.  </p>
<p>But then I&#8217;m not a libertarian am I.  </p>
<p>If you want to blame public sector agents &#8212; google Basel II.</p>

<p>I mean it is bad enough that failure of the Big 3 means the loss of maybe 3 million jobs. Why are you trying to put Dale Earnhardt Jr. out of a job? </p>
<p>Seriously what would the economic impact be to red states if not only NASCAR but all the other car and truck racing circuits collapsed? NASCAR made a run at getting Washington State to build a track here at taxpayer expense with the claim that the positive economic impact would dwarf the expenditure. (The Leg didn&#8217;t bite). But you can&#8217;t deny the economic impact of having some hundreds of thousands of fans visiting town for a couple of weekends a year.<br /><a href="http://www.nascar.com/races/cup/2009/data/schedule.html">NASCAR schedule</a> Sure there are some blue states on the list. But this article claims the impact of the Daytona 500 alone is over $1 BILLION <a href="http://www.paddocktalk.com/news/html/modules.php?op=modload&#038;name=News&#038;file=article&#038;sid=73891">Paddocktalk</a> &#8220;Well we stuck it right to the Yankees. Ha Ha! Too bad there won&#8217;t be any races at <a href="http://www.kentuckyspeedway.com/default.aspx">Kentucky Speedway</a> this year. Or ever again.&#8221; Somehow I am not sure Mitch McConnell really thought this one through. How much is he really willing to put on the line to have GM workers take a $3/hr paycut a couple of years earlier?</p>
<p>Plus I hear football is kind of popular in both red and blue states. Who is going to pay for all the truck commercials? I suppose that as long as Americans don&#8217;t give up drinking beer that televised sports will continue. But the economic impact of the Big 3 goes far beyond parts makers and car dealers. The GOP is playing with dynamite here, the political ads practically write themselves.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Skip Sauer of The Sports Economist was also <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/2008/12/nascar-auto-bailout.htm">all over this one on Tuesday</a>, though somewhat cautious:<br />
<blockquote>My sense is that brand loyalty &#8212; NASCAR is the marketing king of sport &#8212; may be the key factor. It is not uncommon in NASCAR country to see window stickers on a Ford truck that show a punkish-looking boy pissing on the Chevy logo. A strong form of negative brand identity, I submit. If the Ford and Chevy brands are irreparably damaged, will those loyalties transfer to Honda and Toyota?</p></blockquote>
<p>UPDATE TWO: Must have been something in the air. The NYT weighs in: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/business/14nascar.html">NASCAR sponsors hit by sticker shock</a></p>

<p>Exclusive report</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601109&#038;sid=aGvwttDayiiM&#038;refer=exclusive">Bloomberg continues</a> the quest for information on US lending of $2 Trillion.  <br />
<blockquote>The Federal Reserve refused a request by Bloomberg News to disclose the recipients of more than $2 trillion of emergency loans from U.S. taxpayers and the assets the central bank is accepting as collateral.</p>
<p>Bloomberg filed suit Nov. 7 under the U.S. Freedom of Information Act requesting details about the terms of 11 Fed lending programs, most created during the deepest financial crisis since the Great Depression.</p>
<p>The Fed responded Dec. 8, saying it’s allowed to withhold internal memos as well as information about trade secrets and commercial information. The institution confirmed that a records search found 231 pages of documents pertaining to some of the requests.</p>
<p>“If they told us what they held, we would know the potential losses that the government may take and that’s what they don’t want us to know,” said Carlos Mendez, a senior managing director at New York-based ICP Capital LLC, which oversees $22 billion in assets.</p>
<p>The Fed stepped into a rescue role that was the original purpose of the Treasury’s $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program. The central bank loans don’t have the oversight safeguards that Congress imposed upon the TARP.</p>
<p>Total Fed lending exceeded $2 trillion for the first time Nov. 6. It rose by 138 percent, or $1.23 trillion, in the 12 weeks since Sept. 14, when central bank governors relaxed collateral standards to accept securities that weren’t rated AAA.</p>
<p>‘Been Bamboozled’</p>
<p>Congress is demanding more transparency from the Fed and Treasury on bailout, most recently during Dec. 10 hearings by the House Financial Services committee when Representative David Scott, a Georgia Democrat, said Americans had “been bamboozled.”</p>
<p>Bloomberg News, a unit of New York-based Bloomberg LP, on May 21 asked the Fed to provide data on collateral posted from April 4 to May 20. The central bank said on June 19 that it needed until July 3 to search documents and determine whether it would make them public. Bloomberg didn’t receive a formal response that would let it file an appeal within the legal time limit.</p>
<p>On Oct. 25, Bloomberg filed another request, expanding the range of when the collateral was posted. It filed suit Nov. 7.</p>
<p>In response to Bloomberg’s request, the Fed said the U.S. is facing “an unprecedented crisis” in which “loss in confidence in and between financial institutions can occur with lightning speed and devastating effects.”</p>
<p>Data Provider</p>
<p>The Fed supplied copies of three e-mails in response to a request that it disclose the identities of those supplying data on collateral as well as their contracts. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p> The vast gulf in performance underscores a little-appreciated fact of target-date funds: They may focus on the same retirement year, but investment philosophy and the percentage of stocks, bonds and cash varies widely.<br />&#8220;All retirement funds are not equal,&#8221; said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors. &#8220;I was shocked to find the differences in how they move money over time, what the original starting balances were, and the discretion some of them have to change those percentages depending on market conditions.&#8221;<br />Longevity risk<br />Target-date retirement funds have been billed as &#8220;set-it and forget-it&#8221; investments. These one-stop shops blend a fund company&#8217;s stock and bond offerings into a single all-purpose portfolio. Allocation to stocks and bonds is automatically rebalanced over time, and the fund is supposed to ratchet down risk gradually as retirement nears.<br />Target-date funds have proved enormously popular with retirement savers, and the U.S. Department of Labor has even green-lighted them as &#8220;qualified default investment alternatives&#8221; for 401(k) plans.<br />Yet a crucial shift in the design of some of these funds has profoundly impacted investors&#8217; fortunes in the bear market.<br />A couple of years ago, leading providers boosted the equity portion of these portfolios and decided to hold this stock-heavy line well into people&#8217;s retirement years.<br />The strategy is rooted in the belief that retirees should have substantial amounts of money in stocks to get through old age and not outlive their money. The average 2010 target-date fund had about 48% of assets in stocks at the end of September, according to consulting group Financial Research Corp.<br />Fidelity Investments, for example, used to merge its target-date funds into th<br />FFFAX 9.46, +0.02, +0.2%) , with just 20% in stocks, between five and 10 years after the retirement date. In 2006 this so-called roll-down period, or glide path, was extended another five years, which keeps retirees more heavily exposed to stocks for longer.<br />&#8220;I view the implicit time horizon of a 2010 fund as being 22-plus years,&#8221; said Jonathan Shelon, a co-manager of Fidelity&#8217;s Freedom Funds lineup, which reflects an 85-year life expectancy for a typical shareholder. &#8220;The goal is to produce a stream of income, post target-date, which helps people maintain income for life.&#8221;<br />Fidelity isn&#8217;t the only leading fund company to have reworked its target-date funds. Vanguard Group increased stock allocations, also in 2006, while T. Rowe Price Growth<br />TROW 31.43, -0.36, -1.1%) has always channeled more to stocks in its retirement-oriented funds than its peers.<br />&#8220;We think in terms of long time periods,&#8221; said Jerome Clark, manager of T. Rowe Price&#8217;s retirement funds. &#8220;The vast majority in our modeling of the outcomes are going to be better served by a higher equity, growth-oriented approach.&#8221;<br />But this answer to so-called longevity risk has been costly in the bear market. The alterations that were made during a more bullish time have added to target-date funds&#8217; troubles as the market melted down.

<p><a href="http://www.zcar.com/forums/read/4/1974945">AP reports</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Major automakers reported plunging U.S. sales for September &#8212; led by a 34 percent slide at Ford Motor Co &#8212; as an escalating credit crisis hit the slumping industry and raised new doubts about when the world&#8217;s largest auto market would stabilize.</p>
<p>The 26-percent drop in industry-wide auto sales was sharper than expected and coincided with a crisis on Wall Street that automakers said rocked consumer confidence and made it harder for remaining shoppers to finance vehicles.</p>
<p>Sales were down 24 percent at Honda Motor Co, 32 percent at Toyota Motor Corp and 37 percent at Nissan Motor Co. Chrysler LLC sales were down 33 percent.</p>
<p>General Motors Corp, which was more aggressive in its discounting by offering an employee-price sale, posted a 16-percent sales decline. That was a narrower decline than analysts had expected, and it made GM the only major player to gain significant share in a collapsing market.</p>
<p>Across the board, auto executives said Americans had either walked away from vehicle purchases or been stymied by a lack of financing or requirements for larger down-payments.</p>
<p>The bleak sales results represent one of the earliest readings of the impact on Main Street from a now global credit crisis that has triggered a consolidation on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Toyota&#8217;s sales decline was its steepest since 1987. The Japanese automaker&#8217;s sales were down by over 40 percent in key regional markets, including California, where the drop in housing prices has hit consumers the hardest</p>
<p>As the stock market fell and the debate in Washington on a financial bailout raged this week, some buyers of Toyota&#8217;s luxury Lexus models asked for deposits back.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw the trend steadily decline,&#8221; Toyota sales chief Bob Carter said of the uncharacteristically weak demand at the end of the month when sales normally peak at dealerships.</p>
<p>Ford also said the debate over the still-pending, banking bailout stopped buyers in their tracks by injecting a new note of uncertainty. &#8220;It was tantamount to a natural disaster,&#8221; said Ford sales analyst George Pipas.</p></blockquote>
