                                <p>CNN <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/12/05/bush.post.presidency/index.html">works hard for its money</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Although ex-presidents in Adams&#8217; day quickly descended into obscurity after their years in the Oval Office, today the transition away from serving as the leader of the free world is high-profile, potentially very lucrative and, above all, a difficult job in itself.</p>
<p>This is especially true for Bush, historians and political observers say. He not only must oversee the construction of a presidential library and begin writing his memoirs, but he also must grapple with salvaging a legacy mired in the lowest presidential approval ratings in history.</p></blockquote>
<p>Despite the Dolphin Lady&#8217;s protestations (op. cit. <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/keeping-us-safe-by-digby-can-someone.html">Digby</a>), &#8220;lowest presidential approval ratings in history&#8221; isn&#8217;t really an Exogenous variable.</p>
<p>At least now we know why he&#8217;s moving to Dallas; he&#8217;s got a job &#8220;oversee[ing] the construction of a presidential library.&#8221;  Maybe he can hire Michael D. &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_D._Brown">Heckuva Job</a>&#8221; Brown to work with him on this one, too.</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman">Professor Krugman</a> has been having problems with a person named Amity Shlaes.  Well, actually he&#8217;s having a problem more with what she is professing.  Amity is talking about The Great One&#8217;s relationship to today&#8217;s sickly economy and prescribing a plan of treatment.  Doctor Krugman is noting the errors in Amity&#8217;s examination findings and her plan of treatment.  All I can say is, Paul, you&#8217;re arguing with Sarah Palin here.  Amity&#8217;s not even a nurse, never mind a doctor.  Let me expound.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/shlaes122001.asp">article of Amity&#8217;s</a> from 12/20/01 suggesting what is need to fix the sickly economy then: <br />
<blockquote>The result of this labour flexibility is that the US has been able to sustain productivity growth at the outset of recession, something of which virtually no other developed economy is capable. Because US laws make it relatively easy to dismiss workers, companies do not have to waste negotiating time or cash on buying workers out of contracts. <br />When recovery does come, they will have more cash to invest. Because Ford can lose workers, it can also afford to bid for market share by selling cars interest-free. What is more, there will also be cash in the till with which to rehire workers.<br />There are lessons in this picture for all three countries. For the US, the message is: do not do anything to disturb the dynamism of the labour force. This means that the well intentioned plan to expand benefits for the unemployed in &#8220;economic growth and security&#8221; legislation is wrong-headed. For while nationally subsidised unemployment schemes may not target specific companies, they do throw sand into the gears of dynamic economies. <br />For Germany, or Japan, the message is: freer labour policies are crucial to future growth.<br />It is an old truth but worth remembering: &#8220;hire and fire&#8221; also means &#8220;fire to hire&#8221;. The best insurance for growth is creating a culture where workers believe that spring will come and, with it, a new job.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hire and fire also means “fire to hire”?  “You gotta be cruel to be kind in the right measure, cruel to be kind it&#8217;s a very good sign&#8230;”</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amityshlaes.com/bio.php">Amity Shlaes bio</a> it is reported:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;2003, she spent several months at the American Academy in Berlin as the JP Morgan Fellow for finance and economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is the J.P. Morgan Fellows program:<br />
<blockquote>The J.P. Morgan Fellows Program was established in 1996 to promote diversity in graduate business schools and in the Investment Bank. The Program provides half-tuition scholarships for up to 10 first-year MBA students at five of the United States’ top graduate business schools.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, this is very interesting in that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amity_Shlaes">wikipedia</a> notes: <br />
<blockquote>Shlaes graduated from Jonathan Edwards College, Yale University magna cum laude[1] with a bachelor’s degree in English in 1982 (with reference to Yale alumni directory)</p></blockquote>
<p>Her bio does not mention this bit of education.  It mentions nothing related to college at all!  Nor does her <a href="http://www.cfr.org/bios/7536/amity_shlaes.html">bio at the Council on Foreign Relations </a><br />mention anything more than being an adjunct professor at NYU&#8217;s Stern School of Business.  Yet, her career is full of editing jobs.  So, is she teaching business?  History?    </p>
<p>Thus, we have a bachelor’s in english (obviously academically capable) receiving a fellowship for MBA students at the top business schools being used for a trip of &#8220;several months&#8221; to an academy for promoting German/American bonding.  <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=American_Academy_in_Berlin">Via Source Watch</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Academy&#8217;s web site states that it &#8220;presents an English-language public program at the Hans Arnhold Center [each semester]. The program is designed to present the work of fellows both to colleagues and interested members of the public &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.americanacademy.de/home/fellows/">Academy&#8217;s fellowship</a> is only one semester and &#8220;occasionally&#8221; a full year.  </p>
<p>To be fair, at her book page it does state that her first book, the subject of which was Germany came about from her <em>“studying and working in Germany starting in the fall of 1982.”</em>   It just does not describe the studying and working.  Her bio at the CFR states she worked for the WSJ/Europe from 1986 to 1990 as the Editorial Features Editor.   </p>
<p>The question: Is a bachelor&#8217;s in English with a lot of editing work experience editing editorials enough to get an MBA related fellowship to an Academy that gives English speaking lectures which then qualifies you to be a respected commentator of worldly proportions regarding today&#8217;s economic crap all put into an historical perspective?  Not really, but&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll accept a self taught historian, a self taught economist, but just as I&#8217;m a self taught guitarist of 40 years, I&#8217;m considered an amateur as should she be.  There is nothing in Amity&#8217;s bio that suggests that all the honoraries she has received, both in job and awards, are related to anything more than the fact that she is very good with English language.  She was an English major, she writes and reviews writing for God&#8217;s sake.  Though, even in all of that writing there is no list of authorship within peer reviewed journals.  None.  So, how accurate is it to state at her bio page of the CFR this:<br />
<blockquote>Expertise: Germany; Russia; history; economics; U.S. tax policy; relative competitiveness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this expertise bestowed by peers in these subjects or is it expertise based on editing authorship of these subjects?</p>
<p>Professor Krugman, that&#8217;s it. </p>
<p>Here is thus the problem for Professor Krugman and anyone that is trying to correct the errors of Amity&#8217;s ignorance of her subject matter: You are arguing with Sarah Palin, the republican version of the valley girl voicing in a republican <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valspeak">valspeak</a>.  <br />It&#8217;s the republican “brand”.</p>
<p>If there are poster children for the republican <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stepford_Wives">Stepford Wives </a><br />machine these 2 women are it.  They are manufactured women for a specific male need.   </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe me that we are dealing with 2 of the same?  Then listen to the following with your eyes closed and tell me you do not hear Sarah in Amity&#8217;s speech, mind you, with more polish as one would expect from an English major. You do have to get to the points in the programs to where she is feeling comfortable.<br />Like this <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/9552">presentation with Charlie Rose</a>.  Go to 6:15 and start listening. Let it roll to the end of her answer.</p>
<p>There is <a href="http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/vidLink.php?b=1228482642&#038;e=1228484742&#038;n=1">this one</a> which is what keyed me to this thought for today.  I was eating breakfast yesterday morning with Cspan on.  Catch her as she talks about Krugman at 2:50, but dig her talk regarding Hoover at 6:50.  Can you handle that laissez-faire pronunciation?  Did you catch the &#8220;aught not&#8221;?</p>
<p>Finally, this July 27, 2007 <a href="http://www.fee.org/!UserFiles/events/EAFAmityShlaes.mp3">lecture, Foundation for Economic Education</a>: Manipulating America.  She starts speaking after the intro at 2:40. Listen for about 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Now here is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/03/sarah-palin-rnc-conventio_n_123703.html">Sarah&#8217;s acceptance speech</a>.</p>

<p>(again stealing a post from <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2008/12/what-does-earn-mean-i-read-ad-man-i.html">Robert&#8217;s musings</a>)</p>
<blockquote><p>What does &#8220;Earn&#8221; mean</p>
<p>I read</p>
<p>    Ad Man: &#8221; Those of us who sit above the $250k income threshold are too small in numbers to affect his appeal. What I do resent is that under an Obama administration, money we&#8217;ve work hard to earn (through the meritocracy system we put ourselves through) suddenly gets redistributed to those who did not earn it. I worked three jobs to put myself through college. I EARNED everything I&#8217;ve got. &#8220;</p>
<p>I assume ad man works in advertizing.</p>
<p>ad man, I think I don&#8217;t use the word &#8220;earn&#8221; the way you do. I&#8217;d say money can be earned only by doing something socially useful. The fact that money was won in a fair competition does not, in my view, mean it was earned. One might argue that society owes you money because you have given society something. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to say society owes you money, because you made intense efforts to get money. By your nickname, I guess that I wouldn&#8217;t be convinced that you have been obtaining money in exchange for socially useful work.</p>
<p>OK now I am going to risk being rude. I will make an anology. What about criminals ? Some of them put great effort into their crimes and take enormous risks. Does that mean they have earned their wealth ? I&#8217;d say of course not. So is there a sudden jump from efforts that are so bad that we seize all the gains we can and send the actors to jail to efforts which are all equally good so the resulting wealth is equally earned if the same effort was put into obtaining it ? I hasten to add that I&#8217;m sure your income has only legal sources and more power to you. However, so is the wealth of someone who won the lottery. Your effort puts sociiety in your debt only to the extent that society benefited from it. Oh and if you say in the market society pays proportional to social benefit then you have to argue that drug kinpins are making a huge contribution to human welfare.</p>

I will convert next week as JS Kit provides much greater moderation control and more versatility for the comment section.  I am not sure how rss feeds will be affected for comments, but JS Kit looks to be making the process easy.  Conversion will happen suddenly later this week or next.</p>

                                <p>The big news on the blogosphere today concerns parking meters in Chicago.</p>
<p>Matt Yglesias is thrilled.  Kevin Drum less so.  Drum <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2008/12/parking_meter_hell.html">writes</a></p>
<blockquote><blockquote>A private company has agreed to give City Hall an upfront payment of almost $1.2 billion to run Chicago&#8217;s parking meter system for the next 75 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>75 years seems a wee bit excessive to me, and will almost certainly bite Daley in the ass when Morgan Stanley, which put together the winning consortium, packages up the parking meter revenue, securitizes it, rolls it into an asset-backed CPMO (collateralized parking meter obligation), puts the super-senior tranche into an off-balance-sheet vehicle, hedges the rest via a CDS-backed synthetic CDO, and then resells the whole thing within 12 months to a sovereign wealth fund in Dubai for $5 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>From vehicles which aren&#8217;t on the curbe to vehicles which aren&#8217;t on the balance sheet in the bat of an eye.</p>
<p>My honest reaction is &#8220;Huh wha why would Morgan Stanley put a super-senior tranche ino an off balance-sheet vehicle?  </p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve been trying to learn about contemporary finance too fast.  After the jump, I will use my very new knowledge of what the H a super senior tranche is to explain why I would guess that Morgan Stanley kept them on its balance sheet.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/12/01/whats-a-super-senior-tranche?tid=true">Felix Salmon explained what the super senior tranche is</a> (as did ??? in comments here)</p>
<p>OK so the idea of tranches is that one can make highly (say AAA) rated instruments out of lowly rated instruments by pooling them and then selling claims of different seniority on the pool.   A security which pays in full unless, say 15% of the underlying BB rated securities default will be AAA rated even if it pays zero if 16% of the underlying securities default.  So will a security which pays in full unless 16% of the underlying securities default.  What a waste.  That means there are tranches worth more than the lowest value security that barely scrapes an AAA rating.  </p>
<p>Those tranches are called &#8220;super senior&#8221; because they are senior to AAA.  Sometimes they were informally called AAAA rated.  This is nonsense.  The lowest value &#8220;super senior&#8221; tranche isn&#8217;t even the senior tranche.  The point is that, since there are a finite number of ratings, instruments with the same rating have different default probabilities.  Also, due to the miracles of modern finance, the value of a fixed income estimate is not closely approximated by the default probability.  That would be the case if the value of all instruments in default was drawn from the same distribution.  As Lehman Brothers bond holders now know, the&#8217;re not your fathers defaulted bonds (they are now worth 10 cents on the dollar).  In this example a tranche which combined the (pays in full if only 15% default and pays zero if 16% default) tranche and the pays if only 16% default tranche would have a default probability equal to the (pays in full if only 15% default and pays zero if 16% default) tranche, but it would be worth more compared to its face value. The fact that instruments with the same risk of default have different values is another reason that instruments of a range of value have the same ratings.  </p>
<p>The innovation lead to the translation from AAA, which means at least as valuable as the least valuable AAA rated security to &#8220;AAA&#8221; which means the least valuable AAA rated security.</p>
<p>Now it is possible for tranching to be profitable even if the ratings agencies estimate default probabilities perfectly.  The reason is that different firms face different regulations.  For example, European banks have capital controls which depend on &#8220;risk adjusted&#8221; capital.  To a European banker the ratings matter even if he or she doesn&#8217;t believe them.  The capital controls have been binding, that is they would leverage more if they were allowed to.    Thus they are eager for assets which are barely AAA.  They are more risky than average AAA rated instruments and pay higher yields.  However, for the Basel II regulations they count as if they were average AAA rated securities.  </p>
<p>From 2004 until now (or at least until recently) Morgan Stanley did not face binding capital controls.  Therefore they care about actual risk, not Basel rules weighted risk.  This means they want the top ends of ratings intervals, including, I would guess the top end of AAA, on their balance sheets where they don&#8217;t waste valuable legal rights to increase leverage.</p>

<p>The employment report was bad almost across the board.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/STlD3ZTQjMI/AAAAAAAAAlA/1UQDldWZFS0/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/STlD3ZTQjMI/AAAAAAAAAlA/1UQDldWZFS0/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The monthly index of hours worked fell 1.0% to 104.7.  Compared to the last quarter average of<br />106.1 this implies that 4th quarter hours worked are falling at about a 5% annual rate.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/STlEBTZNF-I/AAAAAAAAAlI/FNdeGrpC2bk/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/STlEBTZNF-I/AAAAAAAAAlI/FNdeGrpC2bk/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>When you compared the employment drop in this cycle we are now seeing a more severe drop than in the 1974 and 2001 recessions.  This is clearly testing the bounds of the worse post-WW II recession.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/STlELTzNX8I/AAAAAAAAAlQ/kHw8SZxQ9Qo/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/STlELTzNX8I/AAAAAAAAAlQ/kHw8SZxQ9Qo/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The one encouraging sign is that average hourly earnings are not weakening.  But even this months nice pop was largely offset by the fall in hours worked so that weekly nominal wages only  rose 0.08%.  So if there was any inflation in November real weekly wages fell.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/STlEV8ANkSI/AAAAAAAAAlY/v8O2bznjElE/s1600-h/Clipboard04.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/STlEV8ANkSI/AAAAAAAAAlY/v8O2bznjElE/s320/Clipboard04.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The other point that I have not seen any comment on is that with the plunge in final demand we are now seeing the classic involuntary inventory accumulation. But higher inventories are a leading indicator of more economic weakness.  So we are no where near a bottom in this recession.</p>
<p>P.S. Just thought I would add this table.  It is hard to believe that President Carter is cited by many for having a horrible economy when employment rose 10 million during his term while the same people claim that Bush has a great record.</p>

<p>Yes, you saw that correctly.</p>
<p>David Malpass.</p>
<p>Strangely, they don&#8217;t describe him as &#8220;David Malpass, <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/03/malpass-ass.html">former Chief Economist for Bear Stearns</a>, who long advocated taking monies out of your house because appreciation in housing prices changed &#8220;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/22/business/yourmoney/22view.html?_r=1&#038;adxnnl=1&#038;adxnnlx=1228489230-pp+qqFkPTCIa3fCQpbK8Iw">the structure of the household portfolio</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>And that &#8220;long predicted the credit bubble&#8221;?  This is a family blog, so I can&#8217;t call that horseshit.  So let&#8217;s look at what Malpass said in August of 2007—the point at which his firm was issuing bonds at what were essentially junk levels—<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118645120890190059.html">about the bubble, in the very pages of the WSJ</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Another aspect of the market disruption is a dramatic stand-off between bond buyers and sellers: Buyers in both housing and debt markets are using the market discontinuity to claw prices and terms back to Earth. The slowdown talk weighing on equities also reflects the Wall Street view that debt, mortgage and takeover businesses have replaced General Motors as the economy&#8217;s bellwether. According to the bears: As goes the credit market, so goes the economy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Main Street is not that fickle. Housing and debt markets are not that big a part of the U.S. economy, or of job creation. It&#8217;s more likely the economy is sturdy and will grow solidly in coming months, and perhaps years.</p>
<p>Unlike the 1998 seizure in credit markets to which many are now drawing comparisons, reservoirs of global liquidity are full to overflowing, not empty as they were that year. The deep 1997-1998 Asian crisis has been replaced with an all-cylinder boom. Unemployment rates are falling all around the world, while China&#8217;s equities have continued hitting new highs.

<blockquote>U.S. nonfarm payrolls plunged by an astonishing 533,000 in November, the worst job loss in 34 years, the Labor Department reported Friday.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only the fourth time in the past 58 years that payrolls have fallen by more than 500,000 in a month. Since the recession began 11 months ago, a total of 1.9 million jobs have been lost.</p>
<p>The unemployment rate rose from 6.5% in October to 6.7% in November, the highest jobless rate since October 1993.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, October 1993 was part of a steady <em>decline</em> in the unemployment rate.  (Always check those derivatives.)</p>
<p>And it, arguably, gets worse:<br />
<blockquote>In a separate survey of households, the government found that employment fell by 673,000, the largest lost since August 2001. Unemployment rose by 251,000 to 10.3 million, while 637,000 people dropped out of the workforce. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone else remember when the Household Survey was being pushed by, e.g., Kudlow as the &#8220;true measure&#8221; of the economy?</p>
<p>Wonder if he&#8217;ll do that today.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Can&#8217;t tell if he did, but it&#8217;s &#8220;nice&#8221; to know <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_11_30_archive.html#9086947840828465012">some things never change</a>.</p>

<p>My sentiments about buying locally translate to where I spend my dollars&#8230;there is room for both small business and big boxes, but we all vote with dollars.  </p>
<p>If not careful, I sometimes forget the paint returned at no charge, or the thoughtful advice and knowledge from the local paint and wallpaper store, or the gallon of gas saved by walking to downtown, or the smile and thank you from a person familiar to me at my little ten bank conglomerate which offers CDs at a little less but does not own too many CDSs and CDOs&#8230;choosing takes thought.</p>
<p>I will buy the GPS for Mrs. rdan on-line most likely before Christmas, or at a big box store after, maybe at a closeout sale.</p>
<p>On the other hand Washington Mutual was always helpful and my little bank never called me back on a loan on a property seventy miles away, a two condo house.</p>
<p>I have never figured out what the costs actually are between a nearby local store and another five miles away, nor the worth of familiar courtesy to my psyche.  I also do not shop at one local store due to ownership practices, but that just changed ownership.</p>
<p><a href="http://open.salon.com/content.php?cid=52322&#038;source=newsletter">Salon</a> says granny wants small:</p>
<blockquote><p>Now that I have rationalized why I shopped on Black Friday with millions of other Americans, let me tell you why if I have to shop, I&#8217;ll chose my local small business first.</p>
<p>Small business persons believe all the stories that have been handed down about the entrepreneurial spirit in this country.  And most of today&#8217;s mega businesses started out as small businesses.  They wouldn&#8217;t have made it if they didn&#8217;t get any customers.</p>
<p>During these times of economic challenges for us all, it is so tempting to go to your big box store, wander the aisles, pick up what you want, and perhaps save a few bucks in the process.</p>
<p>But how far did you have to drive to get to that big box?  How far did you have to wander around before you found your item?  How long did you stand in line?  Did you get good service?  Were you able to talk to the owner, even give him or her a hug?  Did the owner offer to make you a deal just because you&#8217;re a good guy?  I doubt it!</p>
<p>Its during times like this when many of our favorite small businesses will go down the drain because they will lose their customer base as those formerly loyal to them head off down the interstate to the nearest Wal-Mart or K-Mart or Target.</p>
<p>Then when times get better, voila!  The big boxes are still around thriving, as usual for their ever larger customer base, but on the corner near you, just down the street, where is that little coffee shop, the car mechanic, the print shop?  They will all be gone, to where heaven only knows.  Their shops will now have dusty or broken windows, graffiti etched all around it, decaying until finally it is bulldozed or burned down, creating an empty space on the block like a smile with a tooth missing.</p>
<p>When this happens, your only choice will be to continue to shop at the big box.  If your daughter or son wants to get a retail job, they&#8217;ll have to apply for a job at the big box, whether this is where they would like to work or not.  Whats more, those cheap prices won&#8217;t be so cheap any more.  Competition will no longer be as tough.  When you beat the competition and there is just you left, why set your prices low?  You&#8217;re the winner now!  You can charge whatever you want now for that new blouse or TV. </p>
<p>And this has happened in many of our small towns.  Take my hometown in Iowa, for example.</p></blockquote>
<p>She describes the closing in her neck of the woods of small businesses.</p>
<p>My downtown has shops&#8230;bagels, ice cream, paints and decoration, coffee and tea, two very small florists, two jewelry stores (hard times now), two small restaurants, a karate dojo, small drug store, hardware, plus businesses on side streets, and a number of artists&#8217; shops and a performance venue in the old converted firehouse due to Chamber of Commerce visionaries.</p>
<p>This is despite the Natick Collection mall and several other malls, even though Nieman Marcus is leaving after two years residence.</p>
<p>Density of population and median income matters.  What else?</p>
