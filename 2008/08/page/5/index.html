                                <p>I spend a good deal of time talking about &#8216;Nothing&#8217; as a plan for Social Security. You can make an excellent numeric case for &#8216;Nothing&#8217; in the short run <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-viii-calculating-cost-of.html">VIII: Calculating the Cost of Inactivity</a> and you can make a reasonable economic case for &#8216;Nothing&#8217; in the long run <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/05/bw-on-soc-sec-ii-shape-of-low-cost.html">II: The Shape of Low Cost</a>. For that matter you can make a pretty good case that even if the Trust Fund does run out at some time in the future that it may not be that big a deal. For example the CBO just released their most recent projection last week in <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/96xx/doc9649/08-20-SocialSecurityUpdate.pdf">Updated Long-Term Projections for Social Security</a> and tell us (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>CBO’s projections indicate that future Social Security beneficiaries will receive larger benefits in retirement— and will have paid higher payroll taxes—than current beneficiaries do, even after adjustments have been made for inflation and even if the scheduled payments are reduced because the trust funds are exhausted.</p></blockquote>
<p> This is because the schedule of benefits is set up so that initial benefits track the overall growth of real wages over your work life, in this case the rising tide DOES lift all boats.</p>
<p>But I have to admit that &#8216;Nothing&#8217; is not a particularly satisfying plan. It is all well and good to say &#8216;So what 78% (Trustees) or 84% (CBO) of the scheduled benefit is better in real terms than what my Mom gets today&#8217; but somehow that leaves something lacking. So I want to propose an action plan based on real numbers and set a time when we might want to move on Social Security in an effort to either eliminate the projected benefit cut or smooth and extend it out. Details and numbers under the fold.</p>
<p>I attempted to make the case in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xxxvii-financing-shortfall.html">XXXVIII: Financing Shortfall</a> that the doom and gloomers who insist that paying back the Trust Fund will require massive tax increases or huge program cuts or unsustainable borrowing are simply ignoring the numbers, in inflation adjusted terms they never approach typical Bush II level unified deficits:<br />
<blockquote> all these numbers represent transfers from the General Fund. Numbers are in billions.</p>
<p>Year:::::Current:::::Constant 2008 dollars<br />2017:::$24:::::::::::$19<br />2020:::$107:::::::::$77<br />2025:::$275:::::::::$172<br />2030:::$471:::::::::$257<br />2035:::$656:::::::::$313<br />2040:::$808:::::::::$335<br />2045:::$0::::::::::::$0</p></blockquote>
<p> Now there is no doubt that given reasonable control on the General Fund side that we could afford to finance these numbers. On the other hand we have other societal needs. So I suggest we pick a target figure of $200 billion in 2008 dollars as the limit for what we will willingly want to transfer from the General Fund (or roughly the one year cost of the current wars). Which suggests a target date for implementation right around 2026-2027. Which suggests firing up the policy shops around 2023 (my scheduled date for retirement, maybe I can land a consultant gig).</p>
<p>Now lets turn around and see what current law requires. The Trustees use two different official measures to track the health of Social Security. One is Long Term Actuarial Balance which is the gap between future income and future cost reported as the amount of payroll tax needed to deliver 100% of the scheduled benefit, or that amount expressed as a percentage of GDP,  or as a Trust Fund ratio all over a 75 year window. The official target is a TF ratio of 100 which is to say a TF balance equal to one year of projected cost in each of the next 75 years. The second measure is Short Term Actuarial Balance which is always reported in terms of TF ratio over a ten-year window. If the Trust Fund is projected to have a TF ratio of 100 or more in each of the next ten years then the overall system is deemed in Short Term Actuarial Balance. If the TF fund is projected to fail that test the Trustees are mandated to urge Congress to act to bring it back in. Which is to say that Short Term Actuarial Balance is the canary in the coal mine.</p>
<p>Currently the Trust Funds individually and combined are in Short Term Balance so under the law we can (and in my view should) wait and see what eventuates. But under current projections when would the system fail the actuarial test?<br /><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#316289">Table IV.B3.—Estimated Trust Fund Ratios, Calendar Years 2008-85[In percent]</a><br />Well a little interpolation shows us going below a TF ratio of 100 in 2036 meaning that if outcomes do in fact come in in line with Intermediate Cost that the Trust Funds will fall out of Short Term Actuarial Balance in 2027, year ten being the trigger.</p>
<p>So both from the financial-economic side and the legal-technical side we end up with an action date under IC projections of 2027.</p>
<p>Now this date is obviously fluid and has been moving out in time. (And if we examine Low Cost we see that the system never fails the test and in fact may need to have its taxes cut back a little to keep the TF ratio at least under 400 and ideally back towards a sustainable 100 over the long term.) But at least it is something to hang our hat on. When anybody asks &#8216;What is YOUR plan for Social Security&#8217; the answer is &#8216;We are targetting the official measure of Short Term Actuarial Balance. If it looks to be failing that test four years out we will start planning with an implementation date of the year the system falls out of actuarial balance. Meanwhile we will simply monitor the numbers as they come out.&#8217;</p>
<p>Sure a little wonkish but it would show that supporters of Social Security are not just working on a hope and a prayer but instead imposing realistic tests on the system. My personal belief is that the date the system is projected to fall out of actuarial balance will continue to recede, but belief doesn&#8217;t buy you much. On the other the numbers are speaking to us and they are telling us we need to do nothing about Social Security before 2027 and plan nothing before about 2023. Meanwhile we have plenty of serious problems in other areas to worry about.</p>

<p>Extremely regular readers of AngryBear will have noticed that I became a guest contributor a while ago.  Then I vanished.  The reason is that I have become obsessed with Presidential Polling and don&#8217;t have much original to say about it.  A dialog from last night between me and my 11 year old daughter</p>
<p>11) dad what are you thinking about<br />rjw) mmm<br />11) Obama right ?<br />rjw) yeah<br />11) why don&#8217;t you ever think about anything else<br />rjw) mmmm.</p>
<p>Now about polling.  My favorite site (by far) if www.fivethirtyeight.com.  Very very impressive.  I call it the silver standard, because, Nate Silver (aka Poblano) being a Democrat, would never support crucifying mankind on a cross of gold.</p>
<p>fivethirtyeight simulates elections and calculates a probability distribution for electoral votes won.  He (they?) consider(s) both state level and nation wide disturbances.  They note that polls tend to narrow over time.  They estimate pollster reliability with data from actual voting (mostly primaries I think). </p>
<p>As of recently he also estimates pollster fixed effects or house effects <a href="http://www.fivethirtyeight.com/2008/08/house-effects-in-da-house.html">&#8220;the tendency of certain polling firms&#8217; numbers to tend to lean in the direction of one or another candidate&#8221;</a>.  This happens to be very important largely because the most prolific pollster &#8212; Rasmussen &#8212; has, relative to other pollsters a tendency to lean pro-McCain.  They also had excellent performance in the primaries and count extra.</p>
<p>My one concern about fivethirtyeight.com is that the calculations are very complicated and not at all transparent.  I would like to see some reporting on a larger set of simulations done with different assumptions.  For example, the house effects correction seems to me to be conservative and I would like to see simulations with a more aggressive correction.</p>
<blockquote><p>3) The house effect adjustment is enacted only in cases where we are at least 90% certain that there is a house effect. Even in these cases, we hedge our bets a little bit, by subtracting 166% of the standard error from the house effect coefficient. </p></blockquote>
<p>I would rather see with/without house effects and the with house effects estimates with just the point estimates no setting to zero if not significant and no subtracting 166% of a standard error.</p>
<p>Silver links to and praises an article on house effects in national polls written by<br />Charles Franklin at <a href="http://www.pollster.com/blogs/how_pollsters_affect_poll_resu.php">pollster.com (my second favorite site)</a> .  This is completely separate evidence of house effects, since fivethirtyeight&#8217;s raw data are state level polls.  Rasmussen polls are significantly better for McCain than average polls.</p>
<p>much more after the jump.</p>
<p>OK here I just let go.</p>
<p>1. My problem with pollster.com is that their trend calculations are waaaay too complicated.  They use a Loess trend estimate (trend value at t estimated with weights depending on how long before/after t the poll was taken then report the fitted value for time = t).  This means that new data shifts past values of the trend line which freaks me out.  It also means that they say Obama is ahead in Ohio because it is about tied now and he used to be behind so they are convinced there is a significant trend.  Also the initial estimates downweight outliers (not explained exactly how).  I do not agree with doing this (see below).  The calculations might be optimal but they are much too complicated to understand.  I&#8217;d rather a point estimate based on averaging (weighted regression on a constant and no trend) and an estimate of the recent slope with a standard error reported as a number).  Still, since I can get the recent simple average from realclearpolitics.com I have no serious complaint (just one more url www.realclearpolitics.com to type I do *not* hotlist pollsters)</p>
<p>2.  What happened to the Gallup anomaly ?  For years <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;as_q=gallup+anomaly&#038;as_epq=&#038;as_oq=&#038;as_eq=&#038;num=10&#038;lr=&#038;as_filetype=&#038;ft=i&#038;as_sitesearch=rjwaldmann.blogspot.com&#038;as_qdr=all&#038;as_rights=&#038;as_occt=any&#038;cr=&#038;as_nlo=&#038;as_nhi=&#038;safe=off">I have been reporting on the Gallup likely voter anomaly</a> &#8212; Gallup polls are better for Republicans than other polls. In the Pollster analysis, Gallup is much less pro-McCain than is Rasmussen and is 4th best for McCain.  The reason is simple.  The Gallup anomaly is an aspect of the Gallup likely voter filter and the vast majority of Gallup polls reported so far are from the Gallup tracking poll of registered voters. </p>
<p>As Gallup explains every 4 years, their likely voter filter is not reliable long before the election.  Gallup has been forced by the competition to report likely voter results earlier than they used to (I remember way back when).  There was a very large huge Gallup likely voter anomaly in the poll <a href="http://www.pollingreport.com/wh08gen2.htm">conducted July 25-27 (click and search for USA Today</a> in which Obama lead among registered voters and McCain lead 49 to 45 among likely voters.  The likely voter pool was strongly biased against the young compared to actual votes in past presidential elections. </p>
<p>Gallup has an excellent record predicting elections.  What this means is that the last Gallup polls before the vote are very accurate.  That is, the likely voter filter works in late October.  This does not mean that it works in August.</p>
<p>What is going on ?  It is simple.  Admirably, Gallup has stuck with the same method they used long long ago.  This is transparent and honest (they aren&#8217;t using their success in the past with one method to justify their claims based on a new method).  It is almost comprehensible how they decide who is a likely voter.  The filter is based on answers to simple questions.  from the <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/4636/How-Define-Likely-Voters.aspx">Gallup FAQ</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8220;These questions include asking whether or not the individual knows the location of his or her voting place, whether or not the individual voted in the past election, how closely the person is following the election, and so forth.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Now obviously knowledge of the location of the voting place in August and in October will differ &#8212; some people learn where it is between August and October.  It is not surprising that someone who claims he or she will certainly vote but doesn&#8217;t know where to go to vote in late October is not likely to vote.  In August, the answer has, I would suspect, much more to do with how long the voter has been registered to vote at his or her current address than the probability that he or she will vote.  The use of that question creates a selection against younger voters (and people who moved recently) stronger than the correlation of age and not moving and voting. </p>
<p>Even the assumption that eligible adults who are not currently registered will definitely not vote is dubious in August.  There is still plenty of time to register.</p>
<p>In any case the evidence that the Gallup filter works in October tells us little about whether it works in August (as Gallup insists whenever asked and often when not asked). </p>
<p>There will be Gallup likely voter polls.  There will be complaints about the Gallup anomaly.  Democrats will be alarmed at Gallups excellent record (based on late October polls).  It is all very simple and right there on the FAQ.</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s with Rasmussen ?  Here a key feature is that they assume that partisan inclination (Dem Rep Independent) changes slowly so that differences from poll to poll in partisan inclination are mostly noise.  <a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/election_20082/2008_presidential_election/daily_presidential_tracking_poll">They reweight so that the partisan inclination matches the average over the past 3 months.</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>Like all polling firms, Rasmussen Reports weights its data to reflect the population at large. Among other targets, Rasmussen Reports weights data by political party affiliation using a dynamic weighting process. Our baseline targets are established based upon survey interviews with a sample of adults nationwide completed during the preceding three months (a total of 45,000 interviews). For the month of August, the targets are 40.6% Democrat, 31.6% Republican, and 27.8% unaffiliated. For July, the targets were 41.4% Democrat, 31.5% Republican, and 27.1% unaffiliated (see party trends and analysis). </p></blockquote>
<p>Now there is no need to smooth that much given the sample size (especially because Rasmussen could use data from other pollsters on party affiliation).  This also shows the difference between a report which is optimal for the pollster and one which is optimal raw material for meta-analysis (here just fancy talk for averaging across pollsters).  Weighting to make party affiliation fit a target reduces noise (increases precision) at the cost of introducing possible bias (if true support for the parties has shifted over time).  For one poll the optimum balance may be to weight.  However if one averages many polls (many Rasmussen polls or many polls across pollsters who do the same thing) the noise averages out and the bias doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Now Rasmussen polls could be corrected by taking a more recent average (also across pollsters) of party affiliation and then using the internals (really simple like 90% of Dems for Obama and 90% of Republicans for McCain and easily available) to calculated a desmoothed Rasmussen based number.</p>
<p>The fact that they are making a very strong, very dubious assumption and have results which are strongly significantly different from the average pollster should give Rasmussen pause.</p>
<p>Finally note how quiet times are good for McCain.  In quiet times the averages across pollsters are dominated by the Rasmussen and Gallup tracking polls.  They both are more favorable to McCain than the average poll.  Some of the alarm (among Democrats hope among Republicans) about Obama&#8217;s vacation, McCain&#8217;s celebrity campaign etc is based on this (I don&#8217;t know how much).</p>

<p>by One Salient Oversight</p>
<p>Statements:<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />1. Together, the amount of money the Italian government spends on debt<br />servicing (interest plus paying back principal) is €263,663 million.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s put that number in perspective.</p>
<p>€263,663 million represents a whopping 41.2% of the Italian government&#8217;s<br />spending in 2007. According to the same document, Italy&#8217;s GDP in 2007<br />was estimated to be €1.475 trillion, which means that debt servicing<br />also represents 17.9% GDP.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;<br />2. Australia&#8217;s fiscal example should stand as an example to other nations.<br />In 1996 when the conservative Howard government came to power, net<br />public debt was around 20% of GDP. While this was quite small in<br />comparison to other nations &#8211; both now and at the time &#8211; steps were<br />taken very early to cut spending. So although net debt was comparatively<br />small, it was never allowed to increase. Importantly, cuts to spending<br />were made when unemployment was moderately high &#8211; at around 8%. This<br />meant that, when the economy recovered from the effects of the spending<br />cuts, economic growth in the years that followed produced large and<br />growing budget surpluses and steady improvements in unemployment.<br />Moreover, the government could then afford to make incremental tax cuts<br />on an annual basis &#8211; a process that was quite politically rewarding.<br />Since 2005, unemployment has dropped below 5%, big budget surpluses are<br />run regularly, income tax rates are lower than ever and net public debt<br />is now negative.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>It is likely that the effects of Peak Oil and the subprime meltdown will<br />be far reaching. Countries that are fiscally weak like Italy will either<br />be forced into making painful fiscal readjustments or else run their<br />nations into bankruptcy-in-all-but-name by increasing their deficits. On<br />the other hand, countries like Australia will be in a more flexible<br />position and will have room to cut taxes or increase public spending.</p>
<p>What will become of America, though? While I would like to think that<br />America could avoid Italy&#8217;s fate I am not at all certain that bipartisan<br />steps can be made to rectify the situation before net public debt hits<br />record levels &#8211; say between 75-85% of GDP.</p>
<p>One thing is certain, however, and that is that America&#8217;s fiscal<br />position will determine its influence in the world over the next 20<br />years. If America should go down Italy&#8217;s route, you can almost guarantee<br />that America, as a society and as an economy, will be a pathetic<br />reflection of what it was for most of the 20th century.</p>
<p>In the face of a semi-permanent energy crisis along with the spectre of<br />global warming, what the world of the 21st century needs is a strong,<br />free America. Being fiscally responsible is an important step in that<br />direction.</p>

                                <p>Rdan-This post is from last year 2007.</p>
<p>by cactus</p>
<p>This post updates an earlier one I wrote on healthcare costs last year, with a few added details.  This update shows Federal spending on healthcare as a percentage of the GDP over time and Federal spending on healthcare as a percentage of the federal budget over time.  Additionally, it shows how the total (private plus plublic) healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP has evolved over time.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let’s get some data issues out the door.  Data on healthcare comes from the <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/downloads/nhegdp05.zip">Department of Health and Human Services</a>  (note… zipfile… pulled off <a href="http://www.cms.hhs.gov/NationalHealthExpendData/02_NationalHealthAccountsHistorical.asp#TopOfPage">this page</a>).  Data runs from 1960 to 2005.  The table also includes data on GDP.  Additionally, data on the Federal Budget is obtained from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2008/sheets/hist03z1.xls">White House OMB Table 3.1</a>.</p>
<p>OK.  Enough with the yadda yadda.  Here are the graphs…</p>

<p>So what do we get from this?<br />1.  Clinton did the best of job keeping federal health expenditures in check, followed by Carter and Reagan.  Coming in at the bottom (no surprise after this many series have been looked at) were the Bush boys.<br />2.  The ability to keep federal health expenditures in check doesn’t seem related to the share of the budget going to healthcare.<br />3.  In terms of keeping total healthcare costs in check (public and private), presumably the most important of the series, Clinton, JFK/LBJ, and Carter lead the pack.  Once again, the Bush boys did the worst among the various administrations.</p>
<p>How did Dems exert this influence on healthcare?  Different ways… JFK/LBJ got the government into the healthcare business in a big way (I didn’t graph it because this post is getting long, but in 1960, the Federal government accounted for 11% of all healthcare spending, but by 1968 it accounted for 24%.  The annualized increase was more than triple that of any other President.)  Clinton, on the other hand, scared the beejeezus out of the health insurance providers… Hillarycare could always be resurrected.  I don’t know enough about the Carter admin to say what happened there.</p>
<p>Or it was all a big coinkidink that good things tended to happen when the Dems were in office.  As with a lot of the series we&#8217;ve gone through so far.</p>

                                <p>I’ve seen some criticism of Obama’s decision to choose Joe Biden as his running mate that goes something like this – Obama should have picked a real Democrat.  Well &#8211; <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121962256899067705.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">Fred Barnes</a> wants to assure you that Biden is a real Democrat in the following sense:</p>
<blockquote><p>But what Mr. Obama has done is create an all-liberal ticket &#8212; a very, very liberal one, at that &#8212; in a nation whose electorate is still center-right &#8230; and liberal Democratic presidential tickets usually lose, as John Kerry did with John Edwards as his running mate in 2004 &#8230; Once regarded as a centrist, Mr. Biden was rated by the National Journal in 2007 as the third most liberal member of the Senate. Mr. Obama was rated the most liberal. Neither has a record of bucking the wishes of liberal interest groups or promoting bipartisanship.</p></blockquote>
<p>No mention of the bankruptcy bill – huh?  Oh well.  Now you might just be saying – “c’mon PGL, don’t you spot the agenda that Barnes has here.  He is a rightwing hack who loves to tarnish folks with the L-word.  Don’t you get that the National Journal ratings are quite simplistic.”  Well, it would seem <a href="http://www.brendan-nyhan.com/blog/2008/08/how-liberal-are.html">Brendan Nyhan</a> agrees with you.  OK, you’re correct – Fred Barnes is a rightwing hack.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=NTA5OTUzZGExN2RkODZmOTdmYzNlMTExNzZmMzEzMTU=&#038;w=MA==">Jack Kemp &#038; Peter Ferrara</a> would have you believe that John McCain would pay for his proposed tax cuts by big spending cuts, while Barack Obama would increase everyone’s taxes so as to pay for a much larger government.  Never mind the fact that their characterization is quite at odds with reality, what offends me is the pretense that <a href="http://www.robertmundell.net/Menu/Main.asp?Type=5&#038;Cat=11&#038;ThemeName=Mundell-Fleming%20Model">Robert Mundell</a> has somehow endorsed the latest nonsense from Jack Kemp:</p>
<blockquote><p>Nobel Prize-winning economist Robert Mundell has written that if such tax increases are adopted, the U.S. economy will suffer “a deep recession, a nosedive,” and the dollar will decline further.</p></blockquote>
<p>Really – when and where did Dr. Mundell actually write this?  After several pages of babbling, Kemp and Ferrara write:</p>
<blockquote><p>Frankly, we are going to need a new theory of economics to argue that Obama’s much higher taxes, much higher spending, protectionism, and much higher energy costs are going to revive the economy and promote economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>No – all we need to do is to turn to Mundell’s open economy IS-LM model but first we have to decide whether the two Presidential candidates are proposing fiscal stimulus or fiscal restraint.  For the sake of argument, let’s suppose Obama is proposing fiscal restraint which will tend to reduce private aggregate demand.  In the Mundell model, this would indeed lead to dollar devaluation as interest rates fell.  But then a weaker dollar would increase net exports, which would at least partially offset the decline in aggregate demand.  </p>
<p>I can’t decide which is the case – is Jack Kemp just too stupid to know that this is the implication of Mundell’s contribution or is Jack Kemp up to his old tricks of lying to the readers of the National Review assuming they are too stupid to know otherwise.</p>
<p>Update: <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121400327981993375.html">Kyle Wingfield</a> did interview Mundell a couple of months ago:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lethal thing to suddenly raise taxes,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;This would be devastating to the world economy, to the United States, and it would be, I think, political suicide&#8221; in a general election.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK, a quick dose of fiscal restraint is not a good idea when aggregate demand is weak.  But phased-in fiscal restraint, which we tried during the Clinton years, could restore national savings without triggering a Keynesian style recession.  Much of the rest of this interview written by a Wall Street Journal’s editorial page writer reads like the usual supply-side gold-bug silliness the National Review is known for.</p>

                            </p>
                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>

                                <p>Bears or Bulls? Winners or Losers? What is going on out there? <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/economics/article4596656.ece">The Time Online</a> today has a nice overview of various takes on the global economy. Below are some choice quotations, the first being my favorite:<br />
<blockquote>“Yachts,” he [Terry Smith of the broker Tullett Prebon] said. In previous summers the ruling families of the Gulf came to Monte Carlo to tie up next to western bankers. This summer, Smith said, western financiers are taking their yachts to the Gulf to curry favour with the families overseeing Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds.<br />“I ring my contacts and they’re all in Abu Dhabi,” said Smith. These are not bankers but men who own and run large private companies. “These are the guys the sovereign wealth funds want to work with – guys so far off the radar they make the hedge funds look transparent.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Here are some others, certain to raise debate:<br />
<blockquote>Smith breaks a City taboo and mixes his economic analysis with politics. He traces the cheap money to Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, and his refusal to raise interest rates to bring surging asset prices under control. “Greenspan was part of a new political culture that started in the 1990s and violated the integrity of his predecessor, Paul Volcker,” said Smith.<br />“Feel-good politicians like Bill Clinton and Tony Blair started telling people only what they wanted to hear.” </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Robson [Steve Robson, a former Treasury official]wonders how America and China will stabilise their unhealthily symbiotic economic relationship. America relies on Chinese savings to fund its deficits, he said, and the Chinese rely on the American export market to sustain their high growth rate. “The yuan is too low against the dollar,” said Robson. “If the Chinese won’t revalue it, the US needs to talk about import tariffs.” In hock to the Chinese, however, America is in a weak position to get tough.<br />“Regulatory reform, proper incentives for bankers . . . these are valid issues,” said Robson. “Ultimately, though, they are displacement activity.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Wonder what he meant by &#8220;displacement activity&#8221;?</p>
<p>The rest of the article is a Bulls-Bears point counterpoint. For the Bears:<br />
<blockquote>Bears say global finance remains out of control and is likely to produce further bank failures as a new round of defaults on debts — ranging from credit cards to loans for leveraged buyouts — overwhelms the system. “We don’t have a sub-prime mortgage crisis,” said New York University economist Nouriel Roubini in a recent interview. “We have a sub-prime financial system.” </p></blockquote>
<p>For the Bulls:<br />
<blockquote>Bulls say the unravelling is over. Passing through London en route from Beijing to Italy for a short break, Citigroup chairman Sir Win Bischoff last week made the case that banks were now healing themselves. Banks still face billions in mortgage-linked writedowns. But Bischoff said “the final tally will depend in large measure on US house prices and the broader stabilisation of the credit markets”. </p></blockquote>
<p>And then there is this choice remark from a former Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund manager:<br />
<blockquote>Laughing off questions about the pattern of yachts moving through the Suez canal, he said western leaders should redirect public attention to the issue of how industrial economies relate to the emerging economies. “How you deal with the coming changes — say half the General Motors assembly line moving to China — will determine where the downturn comes out,” he said. </p></blockquote>
<p>Is that where G.M. is going? Will anyone be surprised?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>China&#8217;s central bank has acquired a secret stake in Prudential, Britain&#8217;s second-­largest insurer, as part of Beijing&#8217;s increasingly active plans to deploy its vast pool of foreign currency reserves in overseas markets&#8230;. </p>
<p>It is not just the insurance sector. The Chinese have been buying stakes in a significant number of companies,&#8221; said one person close to the situation. Banks, resources companies and pharmaceutical groups are among the other industries where falling share prices are likely to have proved attractive in recent months, according to the person.
</p>
<p>The investment from the People&#8217;s Bank of China is the latest in a string of moves by Chinese government entities to pour money into large western companies.<br />An unidentified fund acquired a stake worth about £1bn in BP, the energy company, earlier this year&#8230;
</p>
<p>Last year, officials in Beijing established the China Investment Corporation (CIC), a $200bn sovereign fund set up to diversify the country&#8217;s vast holdings of foreign exchange reserves.
</p>
<p>Since then, its investments have included a $3bn stake in Blackstone, the US private equity firm, and a minority stake in Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment bank.
</p>
<p>In Britain, Barclays has turned to Chinese sources of capital as part of its fundraising rounds last year and earlier this summer. The institution that invested in Barclays was China Development Bank, which has traditionally lent money to finance infrastructur related projects.
