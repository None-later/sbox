<blockquote><p>President Bush proposed a $2.4 trillion election-year budget Monday that would boost defense spending, redistribute funds among government programs, and cross out the $477 billion deficit entirely. </p>
<p>&#8220;Nobody likes making cuts, but the nation&#8217;s current rate of spending and the decreased tax revenues we&#8217;ve seen since implementing my tax cuts have created a deficit that we can&#8217;t afford to carry,&#8221; Bush said in a nationally televised address. &#8220;Someone had to have the vision, leadership, and courage to go in and erase that line altogether, no matter how unpopular and impossible that may be.&#8221; </p>
<p>According to the Congressional Budget Office, the $477 billion deficit is the country&#8217;s largest ever, easily topping the previous record of $290 billion in 1992. If the budget is approved, however, the deficit will roll down to $0.0 billion. </p>
<p>In the past, critics have accused the Bush Administration of responding to a mounting deficit and the ongoing recession with unsound fiscal policies like cutting taxes for the wealthy. Bush supporters say the deficit cut proves the wisdom of the president&#8217;s economic plan. </p>
<p>&#8220;Bush has taken a brave step, one that was long overdue,&#8221; Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) said. &#8220;He has taken charge of the budget problem once and for all, simply by saying &#8216;The deficit stops here.'&#8221; </p>
<p>Faced with the difficult choice of either cutting government programs or raising taxes, Bush reportedly arrived at the radical new &#8220;deficit-cutting&#8221; solution late Sunday night, only hours before he was to announce his budget. </p>
<p>&#8220;I was staring at the figure for the deficit, and I decided that it simply could not stand,&#8221; Bush said. &#8220;It was too high. Something had to be done. But Americans have been taxed and taxed. I say &#8216;Enough taxes.&#8217; By my estimation, this historical crossing-out of the deficit will save American taxpayers millions, billions, and perhaps even bajillions of dollars.&#8221; </p>
<p>The president then turned to Section 14-D of the official budget document, where the federal government&#8217;s total expenditures, the GNP, and the difference between the two were listed. Using a black Sharpie, the president crossed out the third figure, eliminating it entirely. </p>
<p>Bush then held up the newly marked-up page and said, &#8220;My fellow Americans, I have solved the federal budget crisis.&#8221; </p>
<p>The budget is expected to pass through the GOP-controlled Congress with little or no opposition. </p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know why I didn&#8217;t have this idea before,&#8221; Bush said. &#8220;For years, we have tried to control the deficit by eliminating federal programs, lowering taxes for the rich, sending out checks to everybody, and God knows what else. None of us once thought to just draw a line through it.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Bush plan is not without critics. </p>
<p>&#8220;President Bush drew a line through the deficit, yes, and we commend him for that,&#8221; Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-AR) said. &#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t solve the country&#8217;s budgetary problems. While he was at it, why didn&#8217;t he add several zeroes to the end of our GNP?&#8221; </p>
<p>Political pundits have been largely impressed by the visionary slash. </p>
<p>&#8220;Opinions vary as to what the long-term effects of the deficit cut will be,&#8221; New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said. &#8220;One thing, however, is certain: The growing federal deficit, a Gordian knot that for three years no amount of cutting taxes and spending money could unravel, has been sliced in two by the president&#8217;s bold, radical new take on the problem.&#8221; </p>
<p>A CNN/Gallup poll taken immediately after the president&#8217;s announcement showed that 67 percent of Americans support his decision to draw a black line through the deficit, and thereby eliminate it. </p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of the tax-and-spend Democrats always talking about adding zeroes to the GNP,&#8221; said Henry Strom, 40, of Bakersfield, CA. &#8220;How about we cross out our debts and get our affairs in order before we start adding zeroes? We need to cut this deficit and stand firm against printing deficits in future budgets, as well.&#8221; </p>
<p>According to Bush&#8217;s political advisors, later this week, the president will declare that the U.S. has universal health care.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Why does the LA Times publish <a href="http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-oe-goldberg29-2008jul29,0,7045893.column">this stupidity</a>?</p>
<blockquote><p>Last week, ESPN awarded Tommie Smith and John Carlos the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the ESPYs &#8212; the sports network&#8217;s equivalent of the Oscars &#8212; for their once infamous, and now famous, black power salutes from the winner&#8217;s podium at the 1968 Mexico City Olympics.  The stench of self-congratulation surrounding ESPN&#8217;s decision is thicker than the air in a locker room after double overtime.  Comments by ESPN sportscaster Stuart Scott typify the inanity of ESPN&#8217;s award. Scott &#8212; who was 3 years old in 1968 &#8212; nonetheless told the Desert Sun newspaper that he remembers how politically &#8220;tense&#8221; the times were and how he remembers thinking, &#8220;Oh, that was cool for a black man to do that.&#8221; He added: &#8220;As an adult, I get it even more now.&#8221; Even more than when he was barely out of diapers? That&#8217;s setting the bar high.</p></blockquote>
<p>Jonah aka Momma’s Boy wasn’t born until 1969.  Let me give him a clue – I was in high school and even as a Caucasian, I was quite impressed.  But me thinks Momma’s Boy never grasped what the 1960’s were about in the first damn place:</p>
<blockquote><p>In today&#8217;s culture, is it even worth trying to remind people that the black power salute was, for those who brandished it most seriously, a symbol of violence &#8212; rhetorical, political and literal &#8212; against the United States? It was the high-sign for a racist militia, the Black Panthers, which orchestrated the murder of innocents and allied itself with America&#8217;s enemies. (The Cuban 400-meter men&#8217;s relay team gave its 1968 silver medal to Black Panther leader Stokely Carmichael in the name of &#8220;Black America.&#8221;) In today&#8217;s lingo, you might even say black power was &#8220;divisive.&#8221;  But even a more benign view of the salute shouldn&#8217;t obscure the intense contradictions of ESPN&#8217;s decision to honor Carlos and Smith. Both men were members of the Olympic Committee for Human Rights, which wanted a complete black boycott of the &#8217;68 Olympics. The committee considered an entire generation of heroic black athletes &#8212; including Jesse Owens and Jackie Robinson &#8212; to be Uncle Toms.</p></blockquote>
<p>During the 1960’s, many Americans still thought of blacks as at best second class citizens.  There was a disagreement among black leaders whether to fight this blatant racism within the system (ala Reverend King or Jackie Robinson on the baseball field) or to be more assertive ala Malcolm X or the Black Panthers.  But this was NOT an endorsement of America’s foreign enemies as Momma’s Boy would have it but rather a call to America to include all of its citizens.  Divisive?  America WAS divided – in large part because of the white elite that the National Review back then supported.</p>
<p>But then Goldberg has to do his Liberal Fascism routine even here:</p>
<blockquote><p>Another important distinction that should matter is that this was 1968, not 1938.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh yes – 1938 when Nazism was the big threat.  But Jonah?  The Berlin Olympics where Jesse Owens was the track star was in 1936 – not 1938.  I bet Stuart Scott knows this but not the arrogant but incredibly naïve blowhard who for some reason gets a column in the LA Times!</p>

<blockquote><p>WALLACE: According to a recent poll — and let&#8217;s put it up — people rate Obama&#8217;s ads as positive by a margin of 38 percent to 13. But they view McCain&#8217;s ads as negative 31 percent to 19.  Mr. Davis, why is the McCain campaign spending so much time and so much of its money attacking Obama?<br />DAVIS: Well, first of all, I don&#8217;t think that we are spending that much time and money attacking Obama. And I would say Obama is spending exactly the same amount of time attacking us and, frankly, probably more money.  Obama started negative campaigning on John McCain long before we started punching back, and I think a lot of our effort is really to get back into this game, try and galvanize some of the public attention back onto this race, make sure everybody understands there&#8217;s two people in this race, not just one, and I think we&#8217;ve been successful in doing that.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wallace then shows a McCain ad claiming Obama has raised taxes on people making $42,000:</p>
<blockquote><p>WALLACE: All right. Let&#8217;s take a look at one of your campaign&#8217;s recent ads. Here it is.<br />(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)<br />NARRATOR: Life in the spotlight must be grand. But for the rest of us, times are tough. Obama voted to raise taxes on people making just $42,000.<br />(END VIDEO CLIP)<br />WALLACE: Mr. Davis, especially that last sentence, isn&#8217;t that misleading?<br />DAVIS: Nothing misleading about it. Barack Obama voted for a budget resolution that would have increased taxes on people, families, making $42,000. What&#8217;s misleading about that?<br />WALLACE: Well, in fact, it only would be single people making $42,000. It would be families making over $60,000. But Obama — as you say, he voted for a non-binding budget resolution that overall talked about doing away with the Bush tax cuts.  In fact, he says, that&#8217;s not his tax plan, that he supports a middle-class tax cut. And I want to put something up on the screen. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center says someone making $37,000 a year under Obama&#8217;s plan would get a tax cut of $892. Under McCain&#8217;s plan, they get a tax cut of $113.</p></blockquote>
<p>Davis rattles on ending with “Who&#8217;s going to cut your taxes and hold down spending as president of the United States John McCain”, which of course is just more dishonesty.  Wallace continues:</p>
<blockquote><p>WALLACE: But again, when you have a nonpartisan group saying that, in fact, for the exact group that you&#8217;re talking about, people making $37,000, $40,000 a year, that Obama would cut their taxes more than McCain&#8230;<br />DAVIS: Then Obama should put that in an ad. We&#8217;re going to talk about the things Obama has said and done in the United States Senate and on the campaign trail, and that includes his vote to increase taxes on people making $42,000 a year.</p></blockquote>
<p>Davis is not referring to a vote on any tax legislation but I guess Wallace grew tired of this dishonest ad and decided to move on.  When a Republican is called out for dishonesty by Faux News – now that really is news!</p>

                                <p>CORRECTION:If two observations are removed from the non-Presidential election years sample the difference between the seasonal pattern in election years and non-election years</p>
<p>essentially disappears.  This implies that the perceived market manipulation probably did not occur.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Why do gasoline prices display a different seasonal pattern in presidential election years?</p>
</p>
<p>Most people know that gas prices have a seasonal pattern of rising in the spring and falling in the winter.  I’ve even heard radio and TV reporters discussing it.  They usually discuss it in terms of the driving season and the summer surge in gas demand.  But it is not just demand, seasonal variations in supply also play a role in the seasonal swings in gas prices.  Physics, chemistry and economics interact to determine how a refiner divides a barrel of oil between the various products like gas, heating oil, diesel, etc.. They don’t normally try to get only one product out of a barrel of crude oil even though they will refine more heating oil out of a barrel of Venezuelan heavy crude oil and more gas out of a barrel of west <state st="on"><place st="on">Texas</place></state> intermediate.  Refineries are built to work within certain parameters.  For example, a given refiner may be able to produce 50% gas and 50% heating oil in winter and 70% gas and 30% heating oil in the summer. This means that in the winter when they focus on heating oil and gasoline demand is low they still produce more gas and the price of gas falls.  So it is changes in both supply and demand that cause the seasonal swings in heating oil.</p>
</p>
<p>As the following chart, shows the normal pattern is for gas prices to bottom in the winter, rebound in the spring and peak in the fall.  The fall peak is driven largely by refiners starting to prepare for the winter heating season by reducing gasoline output and expanding heating oil production before gasoline demand contracts .</p>
<p>  <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKAuCNeji0I/AAAAAAAAAWM/XNzpNH9HU5c/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKAuCNeji0I/AAAAAAAAAWM/XNzpNH9HU5c/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>
<p>But interestingly, since the oil market was deregulated, gasoline prices have shown a different seasonal pattern in presidential election years.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKAuRj1SftI/AAAAAAAAAWU/mVCeVfp0i-M/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKAuRj1SftI/AAAAAAAAAWU/mVCeVfp0i-M/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>
</p>
</p>
<p>In presidential election years the fall peak in gasoline prices shifts back to the spring and in the months running up to the election, gasoline prices are essentially unchanged.</p>
<p>In the last seven presidential election years gasoline prices peaked in May three times, in June three times and in July once.  So the question is why in non-presidential election years do gas prices peak just before November, but in election years they peak months earlier and are flat running up to the election?</p>
<p>If you did not know better you might think someone had a vested interest in making sure the public was not concerned about gas prices at election time so that energy policy would not be an election issue.  But who would have that concern and the ability to manipulate prices?  What would it take to keep prices stable in the pre-election period? Probably all it would take is for a few firms to delay or dampen the fall refinery switch over from more gasoline to more heating oil output – something hardly anyone would notice.  One firm controls about 20% of <place st="on"><country-region st="on">US</country-region></place> refinery capacity, three firms control 40% and four firms control half of US refining capacity. It would not take much of a conspiracy for a few oil executives to keep gas prices flat before Presidential elections.
</p>
<p>Ok, this is just a crazy theory and I’ve never really been a believer in conspiracy theories. </p>
</p>
<p>But who has a better explanation for the unusual seasonal pattern of gas prices in election years?  In earlier years it could have been crude. But in the last three elections gas prices peaked in the spring even though crude prices continued to rise.  This year it looks like crude prices will cause gasoline prices to be falling in the run up to the election.</p>
<p>  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKAuhXiXqEI/AAAAAAAAAWc/PKdN6efC-L0/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKAuhXiXqEI/AAAAAAAAAWc/PKdN6efC-L0/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>
</p>
<p>So we are really left with the question of why were gasoline prices flat in the face of rising crude prices in the last three Presidential election years?</p>

<p>From last week:</p>
<p>I said: &#8220;The government has no idea what is &#8220;required&#8221;, Anna Lee helped by commenting on &#8220;capability&#8221;. For ya&#8217; all to study: <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/cjcs_directives/cdata/unlimit/m317001.pdf">CJCS M 3170.01</a>.</p>
<p>This week how do they figure out what some &#8220;capability&#8221; is?</p>
<p>GAO is kind enough to help with this post: <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08740.pdf">Missile Defense Agency: Actions Needed to Improve Process for Identifying and Addressing Combatant Command Priorities&#8221;. Jluy 2008</a>.</p>
<p>Observations:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;First, U.S. Strategic Command [Combat Developer, has the &#8220;capability gap&#8221;] and the Missile Defense Agency [Materiel Developer, fills the &#8220;gap&#8221;] have no &#8230;&#8230;..process, which would clearly define each organization’s respective roles and responsibilities for identifying, prioritizing, and addressing the combatant commands’ &#8220;capability&#8221; needs. This has left the combatant commands without an agreed-upon mechanism for influencing agency investments.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So! They cannot tell if what they are working on has any meaning even in fictitious war games run by guys looking for careers after their 20 years.</p>
<p>Hard to argue with the next observation:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Second, the Missile Defense Agency has lacked clear information about how to best address the commands’ needs&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Third, senior civilian DOD leadership has not been involved in adjudicating potential differences among the commands’ priorities. Instead, U.S. Strategic Command has consolidated and submitted the commands’ prioritized capability needs to the Missile Defense Agency without first vetting these priorities though senior civilian DOD officials with departmentwide responsibilities for assessing risk and allocating resources. As a result, the Missile Defense Agency has not benefited from receiving a broader, departmentwide perspective on which of the commands’ needs were the most significant.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Blame it on the civilian side of the DoD.</p>
<p>The things Missile Defense Agency develop for the combatant commands who go to war (the combatant commanders tell the combat developer how they think they need to &#8220;do it&#8221;), are mostly missile defense stuff, like upgraded Patriot systems (PAC-3), Theater High Altitude Air Defense (THAAD), and Mid Range missile defenses. The combatant commands do not talk directly to the materiel developer. The materiel developer talks &#8220;gaps&#8221; to the materiel developer, in this case Missile Defense Agency.</p>
<p>What is supposed to happen is the combatant command recognizes there is a gap between possible enemies missiles and the ability to stop those missile threats. What has happened they are spending all kinds of money and not filling the gaps. The second two observations describe how poorly combatant command gaps are filled and why the system fails. Even though they spend lots of money and have all kinds of unnecessary needs for the next budget.</p>
<p>What we do not see here, which is important, is the analysis which said the combatant command should hire MDA at all. Suppose there were better ways to meet the missile threat? That is not what MDA does and MDA is a priority. Not what gaps it fills. The solution of the past few decades has been Star Wars regardless of the gaps and threats ignored.</p>
<p>Almost as wasteful as all the do-overs and continuous renegotiation of work required.</p>
<p>Good for GAO!! The biggest gap is the gap between a rational defense and the &#8220;capabilities&#8221; bought with the scarce money we are borrowing from our progeny.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t expect the beaks they whittle to fill any one&#8217;s gap.</p>
<p>And in in the extremely remote likelihood the gaps were identified correctly the materiel developers likely will miss the target.</p>
<p>More on that step next week.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/09/AR2008080901556.html">Jon Cohen and Paul Kane</a> eventually get around to quoting someone who understands the economics of this issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>Pelosi has refused to yield on the issue, arguing repeatedly that the only short-term fix for gas prices is for Bush to release millions of barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. It&#8217;s a position that Obama, the presumptive Democratic nominee, has also embraced, along with some public flirtation with supporting a compromise bill allowing for more drilling. &#8220;There is nothing that the Republicans are proposing that will have an impact on the price at the pump. Yeah, 10 years from now, 2 cents. But what we are saying is free our oil in 10 days, not 10 years. And that&#8217;s what we will keep pushing,&#8221; Pelosi told reporters before the August recess.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=08&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=polls_show_voters_want_the_too">Dean Baker</a> is not happy with the rest of this article:</p>
<blockquote><p>The article notes that the overwhelming majority of voters now supports the removal of drilling restrictions. It never points out that the removal of restrictions will have no impact whatsoever on the price of gas for close to a decade, and even when the full effect of new production is felt in 15 or 20 years the impact will only be a 3-4 cents a gallon.  The article does attribute a statement to this effect to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, but this would be comparable to having a quote from Speaker Pelosi denying the existence of the tooth fairy. The non-existence of the tooth fairy is not a matter of partisan dispute, it is a fact. Similarly, it is a fact that removing environmental restrictions on drilling will have no impact on oil prices any time soon and only a trivial impact in a decade or two. The polling results presented in this Post article are a testament to the incredibly bad reporting on this topic, which has led so many voters to believe something that is clearly wrong. This article provides an example of poor reporting.</p></blockquote>
<p>This kind of terrible reporting is one reason why politicians feel the need to pander to voters.  As long as voters are being misled by those they trust to tell them the truth, there is little incentive for politicians to propose sensible policies.  Thank goodness we have economists like Dean Baker to “Beat the Press” as it were.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I don&#8217;t want to pile on but I did think the new actuarial note was important enough to justify the XLII post.</p>
<p>I want here to front a discussion from the comments on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xli-why-not-assume-low-cost.html">XLI: Why not assume Low Cost?</a> where I think people are talking past each other. There seems to be some confusion between the concepts of &#8216;Solvency&#8217; and &#8216;predictions of solvency&#8217;.</p>
<p>If we use a starting point of the current year it is pretty clear that the range of outcome from Low Cost to High Cost is overwhelmingly determined by assumed demographics. This is shown pretty clearly in <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/IV_LRest.html#304086">Table IV.B1.—Estimated Annual Income Rates, Cost Rates, and Balances, Calendar Years 1990-2085 [As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a> where the difference in Income rate (the product of real wage/productivity) between Intermediate and Low Cost in 2040 is 11.38 to 11.27 or .11% of payroll while the difference in Cost rate is 14.71 to 12.79 or 1.98% of payroll. And it seems obvious that Cost is primarily driven by the demographics something we can confirm by consulting <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_LRsensitivity.html#92699">Table VI.D2.—Sensitivity to Varying Death-Rate Assumptions[As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a> as opposed to the other component of Cost <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_LRsensitivity.html#93319">Table VI.D5.—Sensitivity to Varying CPI-Increase Assumptions[As a percentage of taxable payroll]</a> where we can see clearly that mortality assumptions have twice the impact on outcomes than inflation assumptions do. So given that the range of outcomes shows that cost is more important than income and that cost is largely if not entirely driven by mortality one could conclude that game, set and match belong to Coberly.</p>
<p>Well not so fast. Though it appears that the range of outcomes is driven by demographics it is not at all clear that the mid-point is. In the Sensitivity tables the mid-point is defined by date of Trust Fund depletion. And year over year changes in this date simply cannot be explained by demography, we don&#8217;t typically get changes in outcomes or predictions big enough to move the needle. And we don&#8217;t have to guess at this, the Trustees supply us with a table that explains exactly what factors change to projected gap in payroll. For example 1999 showed a rather dramatic drop in payroll gap to 2.07% from 2.19% and a change in projected depletion from 2032 to 2034. Table I.B1 on page 5 of <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR99/tr99.pdf">1999 Report in PDF</a> shows us that changes in demographic assumptions resulted in a +.03 change in actuarial balance while the change due to economic assumptions swamped that five-fold with a +.15 change.</p>
<p>So it seems that the date of Trust Fund depletion is largely driven by productivity and GDP while the range of outcomes is determined mostly by demography. It all depends on whether your definition of &#8216;solvency&#8217; is focused on actual outcome or by timing. My particular focus is on timing, Coberly&#8217;s on outcome. It all boils down to potato vs potatoe. (And we don&#8217;t have to call the whole thing off).</p>

                                <p>In a really timely fashion the Office of the Chief Actuary released their Actuarial Note 2008.1 with the above title last month. It is well worth the read for anyone wanting to cut through the conceptual tangle raised in the recent posts on &#8216;Unfunded Liabilities&#8217; and &#8216;Backwards transfers&#8217;. In addition it provides us with some new useful terms of art. (h/t Andrew Biggs)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/ran1/index.html">Actuarial Note 2008.1: Unfunded Obligation and Transition Cost</a>. (The Note itself is a frame within the page. Click on HTML and then July and the actual text pops up.) While the substitution of &#8216;obligation&#8217; for &#8216;liability&#8217; may seem like a minor point, it actually marks a major sea change in how we think about potential gaps between future Social Security cost and income. A list of new definitions lies below the fold. I&#8217;ll try to use these in consistent fashion going forward.</p>
<p>The whole thing is an important read for anyone seriously interested in understanding the actuarial position Social Security is in today and what it would take to transition it to a fully funded pension system along the lines of LMS. And the tables present a nice picture of how that actuarial position has changed over time not only in dollars but as a percentage of payroll and GDP.</p>
<p>Accrued benefit obligations—Future benefit obligations based on past earnings as of the valuation date. Thus, these accrued benefit obligations are relevant only to current participants as of the valuation date. The accrued benefit obligations are based on the primary insurance amount (PIA), the early retirement or delayed retirement factors, and other rules of payment. The accrued benefit obligations include:</p>
<p>1) Benefits scheduled to be paid for current (i) retired-worker beneficiaries and (ii) disabled-worker beneficiaries who continue to be disabled after the valuation date.</p>
<p>2) Retired worker benefits based on PIAs determined as of the valuation date for workers who have reached benefit eligibility age (62) and are not yet receiving benefits.</p>
<p>3) Benefits calculated on a proportional past-service-credit basis determined as of the valuation date for current active participants under age 62. These benefits require a computation of a PIA (PIADIB), as of the valuation date, as if the worker had just became eligible to receive a disabled-worker benefit. These benefits are then adjusted so they may be viewed as benefit levels of a worker aged 62. The adjustments are made depending on the type of worker, as illustrated below.4</p>
<p>a. For workers who survive to age 62 and are not disabled after the valuation date, PIADIB would be indexed to age 62 by the Social Security Average Wage Index, and would then be multiplied by the fraction</p>
<p>(age as of the valuation date &#8211; 22) / 40.</p>
<p>b. For workers who survive to age 62, are not disabled as of the valuation date, and become disabled before age 62, PIADIB would be indexed to the date of disability by the Social Security Average Wage Index, and would then be multiplied by the fraction</p>
<p>(age as of the valuation date &#8211; 22) / <br />(age as of the date of disability &#8211; 22).</p>
<p>c. For beneficiaries who are disability beneficiaries as of the valuation date, recover from disability before age 62, and survive to age 62, benefits would equal the disability benefit scheduled to be paid until recovery. After reaching age 62, benefits would be computed based on indexing the final disability benefit received before recovery (PIADIB-RECOV) to age 62 by the Social Security Average Wage Index, and would then be multiplied by the fraction</p>
<p>(age as of recovery from disability &#8211; 22)/40.</p>
<p>Benefits for auxiliary beneficiaries would be based on the primary worker&#8217;s benefits as described above.</p>
<p>Closed group transition cost—Computed like the open group unfunded obligation for a 100-year projection period with the exception that future participants are not included. Specifically, the future cost and future scheduled tax income for only current participants are included in the calculations along with the trust fund assets at the start of the period. The period is extended to 100 years past the valuation date in order to capture the lifetime of all the current participants included in the valuation.</p>
<p>Current participants—All individuals (generations) who are age 15 and older as of the valuation year. This includes all individuals who have been, are, or will be workers and/or beneficiaries. (As noted in Table 3, the age 15 varies for valuation dates before 1984.)</p>
<p>Future cost—The value of OASDI program benefits scheduled in current law and the cost of administering the program.</p>
<p>Future participants—Future workers and beneficiaries, who are under age 15 or not yet born, as of the valuation year. (As noted in Table 3, the age 15 varies for valuation periods before 1984.)</p>
<p>Future scheduled tax income—OASDI tax income scheduled in current law.</p>
<p>Maximum transition cost—The cost of meeting the accrued benefit obligations of the old form while continuing the Social Security program in a completely different form, with all payroll taxes for work after the valuation date credited to the new benefit form. The maximum transition cost is determined as of the valuation date for current and past participants only. It is computed as the difference between</p>
<p>(a) The present value of all future accrued benefit obligations payable on the old form; and</p>
<p>(b) The value of the assets on the valuation date plus the present value of revenue from taxation of future accrued benefit obligations payable on the old form.</p>
<p>The projection period ends 100 years past the valuation date in order to capture the lifetime of all the current participants included in the valuation.</p>
<p>Open group unfunded obligation—Determined as of the valuation date over a specified time period (such as over the long-range 75-year period), computed as the difference between:</p>
<p>(a) The present value of the future cost of the program between the valuation date and the end of the specified time period, and</p>
<p>(b) The sum of the assets in the trust fund as of the valuation date and the present value of the future scheduled tax income of the program between the valuation date and the end of the specified time period.</p>
<p>Future scheduled tax income and cost are projected using the intermediate assumptions for the indicated Trustees Report (the year of the Trustees Report corresponds with the year of the valuation date). All current participants, as well as future participants to the system, over the specified time period are included in the computations.</p>
<p>Past participants—Those who contributed money to the program or received benefits from the program and are no longer alive as of the valuation date.</p>
<p>Sustainable solvency—Indicates that the combined OASDI Trust Funds are expected to be able to pay all scheduled benefits on time over the 75-year projection period and to continue paying all benefits on time for the foreseeable future. Thus, the following two conditions are required to be met:</p>
<p>(a) The level of the trust funds at each point in time during the 75-year projection period is zero or positive, and</p>
<p>(b) The level of the trust funds, expressed as a percent of annual program cost, is stable or rising at the end of the 75-year period.</p>
<p>Valuation date—Beginning of the projection period or January 1 of the starting projection year. This date defines the point in time for determining present values.</p>
<p>Valuation year—First year of the projection period. This year is used to determine current and future participants.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/0.../07citi.html?%20em">2 Banks Will Buy Back $17 Billion in Securities</a> <br />August 6, 2008 </p>
<blockquote><p>Two Wall Street giants agreed on Thursday to buy back more than $17 billion of auction-rate securities that were improperly sold to retail customers, likely paving the way for other banks and brokerage firms to take similar actions.</p>
<p>Citigroup reached a settlement Thursday morning with state and federal regulators, agreeing to buy back about $7.3 billion of auction-rate securities that it sold to retail customers and pay a $100 million fine for its conduct.</p>
<p>Merrill Lynch said it would buy back about $10 billion in auction-rate investments that it sold to retail investors, a move that gets ahead of regulators investigating the company. </p>
<p>Neither firm agreed to reimburse institutional investors, though both said they were trying to resolve similar problems with those customers.</p>
<p>Regulators have been investigating at least a dozen Wall Street firms for their role in the sales and marketing of so-called auction-rate investments, and analysts expect a wave of settlements in the next few months.</p>
<p>Bank of America, the largest retail bank, said Thursday that it had also received subpoenas from federal and state regulators related to sales of auction-rate securities. The investments are preferred shares or debt instruments with rates that reset regularly, usually every week, in auctions overseen by the brokerage firms that originally sold them. </p>
<p>The $300 billion market for the investments collapsed in February, trapping investors who had been told that the securities were safe and easy to cash in.</p>
<p>Citigroup’s settlement with state and federal regulators included a fine of as much as $100 million. </p>
<p>In a statement, the New York attorney general Andrew Cuomo said that Citigroup would buy back, by Nov. 5. auction-rate securities from individual investors, charities and small- and mid-sized businesses. These customers, about 40,000 nationwide, have been unable to sell their securities since Feb. 12, the statement said.</p>
<p>In a similar case in Massachusetts, Morgan Stanley reached an agreement with the attorney’s general office on Thursday to reimburse the cities of New Bedford and Hopkinton $1.5 million for the investments in the securities, the Massachusetts attorney general Martha Coakley said in a statement.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, Citigroup agreed to a public arbitration process to resolve claims of consequential damages suffered by retail investors. </p>
<p>The bank, one of Wall Street’s biggest auction-rate securities dealers, will pay the $100 million to the New York attorney general’s office and a task force of 12 state regulators, led by the Texas State Securities Board. Each group would exact a $50 million penalty.</p>
<p>The federal Securities and Exchange Commission also participated in the settlement talks but elected not to exact a penalty, pending its own investigation. </p>
<p>The settlement follows several days of meetings between Citigroup and the state and federal regulators, and reflects Citigroup’s desire to put its auction-rate securities troubles behind it. </p>
<p>Thursday’s settlement has implications for other Wall Street firms, with the Citigroup deal serving as a benchmark for the industry. Two other banks, UBS and Merrill Lynch, are under investigation by several groups of regulators. But unlike Citigroup, UBS faces additional accusations that at least one of its executives engaged in insider trading. </p>
<p>Citigroup shares were down about 3.5 percent Thursday; Morgan Stanley shares were down less than one percent.</p></blockquote>
