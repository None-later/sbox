<p>Andrew Biggs in <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2008/08/treatment-of-uncertainty-in-new-cbo.html">Treatment of uncertainty in new CBO Social Security projections</a> directs our attention to the new release from the Congressional Budget Office. I don&#8217;t tend to focus on CBO projections precisely because they are more optimistic than the Trustees&#8217;, I don&#8217;t want to open the door to people claiming I was misrepresenting dates of depletion or something. But like Low Cost CBO is out there. First point:<br />
<blockquote>Today, Social Security’s revenues each year are greater than its outlays, but as the baby-boom generation (people born between 1946 and 1964) continues to age, growth in the number of Social Security beneficiaries will accelerate, and outlays will grow substantially faster than revenues. CBO projects that outlays will first exceed revenues in 2019 and that the Social Security trust funds will be exhausted in 2049.</p></blockquote>
<p> I would only point out that surviving Boomers will be 85 to 103 in 2049. Second point:<br />
<blockquote>In 2049— CBO’s projected date for the trust funds’ exhaustion—revenues will equal only 84 percent of scheduled outlays. Thus, payable benefits will be 16 percent lower than scheduled benefits. Beginning in about 2070, the gap between scheduled and payable benefits will begin to grow, and by 2082, CBO projects, payable benefits will be 19 percent less than scheduled benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p>CBO: 84% payout at depletion in 2049, 81% payout in 2070. SSA Trustees: 78% payout at depletion in 2041, 75% payout in 2082. Third point (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>CBO has projected that 2049 is the year in which the balance in the trust funds, and thus the trust fund ratio, will fall to zero. But, as shown in Figure 3, there is a 10 percent chance that the trust funds will be exhausted in 2034 or earlier and a greater than 10 percent chance that they will not be exhausted before 2082.</p></blockquote>
<p>Does CBO use rosier demographics to derive these numbers? No:<br />
<blockquote>A number of basic assumptions underlie all long-term projections of the Social Security program’s finances. To project overall trends in demographics and disability, CBO adopts the assumptions of the Social Security trustees—specifically, for this analysis, the assumptions in the 2008 trustees’ report on the aggregate fertility rate, the rate of decline in mortality, the level of immigration, and the rates of disability incidence and termination.</p></blockquote>
<p> What about economic assumptions?:<br />Real Wage 1.4%<br />Total Factor Productivity 1.3%<br />Labor Productivity 1.9%<br />Real Rate of Interest 3.0%<br />Inflation (CPI-W) 2.2%<br />Unemployment 4.8%</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a lot to say here, I can only point at the numbers. And the story they tell does not add up to crisis. CBO does not present the outlook in terms of payroll tax gap (that I could see) but a back of the envelope calculation suggests that if backfilling a 22% gap requires an immediate 1.7% of payroll (2008 Trustees) that a 16% gap should require maybe 70% of that or about 1.2%. {see update} I&#8217;ll leave it to Coberly to add some precision and attach a dollar figure here. But all in all if the CBO is getting this right Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; is more like a tempest in a tea pot than anything.</p>
<p>Anyhow lots of graphs and tables for those of you who like such things.<br />UPDATE (h/t lord)<br /><a href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=158">CBO Director&#8217;s Blog: Long term projections for Social Security: innovations in presenting uncertainty</a><br />
<blockquote>Today we released a paper on updated long-term projection for Social Security. (Our last long-term projection for social security was included in the December 2007 Long-Term Budget Outlook.) As CBO has highlighted in previous reports, the number of Social Security beneficiaries will grow considerably as the baby boomers become eligible for retirement benefits. Absent legislative changes, spending for the program will therefore climb substantially and exceed the program’s revenues. CBO projects that the 75-year actuarial imbalance in the program amounts to 0.38 percent of GDP, or 1.06 percent of taxable payroll.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>EconomistMom recently <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/economistmom/~3/366267387/">defended</a>, after a fashion, Alex Brill and Alan Viard&#8217;s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/attacking-obamas-tax-plan-with-basic.html">notorious article</a> claiming that the Obama tax plan would raise effective marginal tax rates on middle-class taxpayers.  They&#8217;re making a mountain out of a molehill, she concludes, even incidentally distorting the Obama tax plans along the way, but to her knowledge (of the two of them) wouldn&#8217;t be deliberately dishonest.  More below the fold.</p>
<p>Before you say &#8220;born yesterday,&#8221; she&#8217;s almost surely right at the very least in the sense that if you&#8217;re running the in-house publication of a conservative think-tank, you need only run down (say) the list of the economist supporters the McCain economic &#8220;plan&#8221; — yes, even the <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/07/13/john-mccain-300-economists-support-my-economic-plannot/">subset who actually read it!</a> — to find people who earnestly believe that lack of incentives to make money is a serious problem for the U.S. economy and willing to write something up to that effect.  The economists are then pure (if deluded) and the upshot, for the policy entrepreneurs, is perhaps even better than hiring obvious hacks.  Among other things, real economists like Jonah Gelbach will engage those issues.</p>
<p>As a <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/1159566016908375881/">comments-hoisting</a> aside, the Brill and Viard piece highlights a cost of conducting progressive policy through tax expenditures.  I don&#8217;t think even center-leftists of the Obama camp are necessarily opposed to public provision of the services they&#8217;re trying to fund through the tax system, but to some extent they&#8217;ve pre-compromised on packaging them as delectable tax cuts to make them appeal to conservatives.  At my <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2005/10/vision-thing.html">old place</a>, I&#8217;d argued that liberal think-tankers need to take a lesson from the Heritage Foundations of the world and advocate the policies they really want:<br />
<blockquote>I agree with TCT [Madison&#8217;s late progressive newspaper] that CAP needs to eat its spinach [in the Popeye sense]. It comes across like a center-left-center quasi-counterbalance to the only moderately wingnutty American Enterprise Institute rather than what it arguably needs to be, which is the Heritage Foundation of the left.</p>
<p>The lack of boldness cited by TCT is particularly evident in a misplaced fetish of pragmatism. Why misguided? Sure, CAP policy proposals would constitute a distinct improvement over Bushism, but their chance of getting any of them enacted with Republicans in charge of the executive and legislative branches is effectively zero [this was written in 2005, but things have changed surprisingly little]. And CAP policy proposals are not likely to fire people up to elect Democrats.</p>
<p>There is consequently no cost to thinking bigger (abstracting from CAP&#8217;s funding sources), and in fact there are likely to be massive longer-term benefits in that incubating actual progressive ideas is an entrée to building a political coalition for their enactment&#8230; [R]ushing, or at least appearing to rush, into the vacuum left by right-running Republicans fractures the progressive vote.</p></blockquote>
<p>And for all that, the wingnuts pay liberals back for their efforts at compromise by complaining that those tax cuts just make the tax code more complicated and screw up &#8220;incentives.&#8221; </p>
<p>Meanwhile the marginal rate business seems to be a meme on the other side of the fence, as <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/08/obamas-top-marginal-tax-rate.html">Greg Mankiw heh-indeeds</a> a Tax Foundation blog post suggesting that the top effective Federal personal tax rate would increase roughly 10-12 percentage points under Obama tax proposals.  (See?) <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/blog/show/23491.html">Sez Bob Carroll</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Note: These calculations work as follows: (1) 37.9 percent equals the current 35 percent top income tax rate plus the current 2.9 percent Medicare tax rate; and (2) 48 to 50 percent equals Obama&#8217;s 39.6 percent top income tax rate plus the 2.9 percent Medicare tax rate plus his additional 2-to-4 percent hike in the Social Security tax rate plus an additional roughly 4.5 percent for the phase-out of personal exemption and certain itemized deductions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this calculation ingenuous and totally correct?  No, it is not.  Sort of like Brill and Viard, Carroll is calculating what will tend to be top inframarginal rates applying to portions of the income of the very well-to-do.  They don&#8217;t do much to characterize of the general tenor of the Obama tax plans as they&#8217;d affect the median voter — other than, maybe, the feature of shifting more of the tax burden back to the rich (apparently Prof. Mankiw <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/08/01/the-past-lucrative-life-of-feds-mishkin/">cares personally</a> about those rates).</p>
<p>First, a regularity of upper-income tax returns is that much or most of the income comes from non-wage sources that aren&#8217;t subject to the payroll tax. According to the latest (2006) <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/indtaxstats/article/0,,id=96981,00.html">tax filing statistics</a>, taxable returns with Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) between $500,000 and $1 million — the lower-middle class, per John McCain — reported on average $678,000 in AGI and $591,000 of taxable income, of which wages and salaries averaged only $320,000.   All that non-employment income would be taxed at no more than the statutory rate for ordinary income — so the difference there is the 35% Bush-era rate vs. the 39.6% Clinton-era rate.  Suggesting that the Clinton-era rates don&#8217;t provide sufficient incentives for the near-rich and rich to make more money is silly.</p>
<p>Another issue pertains to adding 4.5 percentage points for the exemption and deduction phaseouts to Obama&#8217;s rate.  The statutory phaseout rates are 2.8% for personal exemptions and 3% for itemized deductions, or 5.8%.  Nevertheless, Carroll is not being generous by charging Obama&#8217;s plans with 4.5% instead of 5.8%.  For one thing, the personal exemption is, except for weird cases — married taxpayers with adjusted gross income in a narrow band around $360,000 and next to nothing in itemized deductions — already phased out before you get to the top bracket.  So the effective net hit is no more than 3%, and probably a lot less if not zero. That&#8217;s because in this income range, the ordinary income tax interacts strongly with the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), with AMT taking away deductions given back by the phaseout of the phaseout.  (If you want to view that last sentence as an argument for tax re-simplification, I wouldn&#8217;t argue.)  It&#8217;s worth remembering that increased AMT incidence was a feature of the 2001 tax cuts from the perspective of reducing the law&#8217;s apparent revenue reduction and gulling the theoretically fiscally conservative into voting for them.</p>
<p>More broadly, this focuses attention where it should not be, which is to say the plight of the rich — who don&#8217;t especially need help (beyond generally sound economic policies) staying rich or getting richer.  Though it does seem, fortunately, that the Obama campaign has <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=a_unified_message_on_mccains_e">figured out that they have an issue</a> there.</p>

<blockquote><p>Troubles at United States banks are making mortgage, credit card and business loans scarcer and more expensive. Falling home prices, rising foreclosures and high gas prices have stalled home building and consumer spending. These problems are exacerbated by the long-festering trade deficits on oil and with Asia on consumer goods and cars that tap off demand for US-made goods and services.</p>
<p>How the George W Bush administration (and its successor) and the US Congress respond to these challenges will importantly determine how Americans emerge from the current malaise. With the right policies, the economy can grow at 3.5% to 4% a year, perhaps a bit more. Without meaningful reforms in banking and</p>
<p>changes in energy and trade policies, the United States is headed for substandard growth and a declining standard of living for many workers.</p>
<p>Since 2005, US imports have exceeded exports by more than US$700 billion or more than 5% of gross domestic product (GDP). To finance the trade gap, Americans sell bonds and other securities to foreigners, including the People&#8217;s Bank of China and other central banks.</p>
<p>Until recently, money center banks and securities dealers, such as Citigroup and Merrill Lynch, recycled foreign funds to US consumers. Consumers borrowed ever-larger sums to live beyond their means through exotic mortgages, questionable auto loans and lax credit-card rules.</p>
<p>In the housing market, mortgage companies were aided by real-estate appraisers, who juiced estimated home values, and Wall Street bankers, who transformed shaky loans into seemingly low-risk mortgage-backed bonds for sale to insurance companies, pension funds and foreign investors. The bond rating agencies turned a blind eye and blessed these transactions.</p>
<p>These schemes now exposed, banks can&#8217;t securitize mortgages into bonds and must finance mortgages through more expensive certificates of deposit. US homebuyers must put up larger down payments and pay higher interest rates and fees to get loans.</p>
<p>The result is predictable: housing prices are falling. Builders have a 10-month supply of unsold new homes, and new home construction is down more than 55% since April 2006.</p>
<p>Rising delinquencies and repossessions are making similar abuses apparent in credit card and auto loans. Lenders face difficulties selling bonds to finance new loans and are increasing monthly interest rates and tightening qualifications.</p>
<p>Consumers can&#8217;t run up debt as easily to boost spending and live beyond their means. Sales are falling at shopping malls and restaurants, and consumer demand for US-made goods is stagnating.</p>
<p>Similarly, banks are making fewer loans to businesses for worthwhile projects, and business spending on commercial buildings and new equipment and software is expected to stall in the second half of 2008 and 2009.</p>
<p>Thanks to this grand deleveraging, economic growth has averaged only 1% a year since the fourth quarter of 2007 and is expected to continue to limp along at that pace until the second half of 2009. It will take that long for the banks to clear out all their bad loans, for most of the expected 2 million-plus foreclosures and resales of homes to be completed, and households, generally, to restore their balance sheets through more conservative spending patterns.<br />Getting the economy going again will require getting the banks on a sound footing, so that mortgage money and other credit are available on reasonable terms. But if the United States is to grow at a decent, sustainable pace and avoid another credit crisis and deleveraging, it must reduce its trade deficit and reliance on foreign borrowing.</p>
<p>Simply, trade deficits of more than 5% of GDP require Americans to spend more than 105% of what they earn to maintain demand for domestically produced goods and services and sustain GDP growth and employment. Even if foreigners are willing to continue buying US bonds, financing American consumption at that level will require the banks and finance companies to write progressively more risky loans, as they did during the last economic expansion, until debts cannot be repaid.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Inevitably, that would end in another banking crisis and credit shortage, painful deleveraging, and period of slow growth similar to the current slog, or worse.</p>
<p>To accomplish healthy growth, the United States must slash its trade deficit, dramatically, over the next several years. Imported oil, cars from Japan and South Korea, and consumer goods from China account for nearly the entire US trade deficit. No permanent solution to the US quagmire is possible with addressing those issues.</p>
<p>Global oil supply has not kept up with demand in recent years, because several important exporters, including Venezuela, Russia, Nigeria and Mexico, have shunned the investment and know-how Western oil companies can offer to sustain their production.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, crude oil prices have receded, somewhat, but this is because the US, European and Japanese economies are slowing and speculators face more hurdles in financing positions, and not because the basic global supply imbalance has been redressed.</p>
<p>Higher oil prices may be here to stay, but the technologies to reduce US oil imports dramatically are at hand. Hybrids, plug-in electric and even hydrogen-powered vehicles are no longer fanciful proposals. Coal gasification is viable at $55 a barrel for oil, and more-efficient building designs, appliances and heating systems are all possible at affordable costs.</p>
<p>Economists assert that the market will provide, but they fail to reckon with the fact that most epic transformations in transportation technology &#8211; canals, turnpikes and national highways, railroads and airplanes &#8211; got boosts from the government to overcome the barriers created by habits and costs of switching. For example, the biggest problem getting into production and use of hydrogen cars will be the initial investment in fueling stations and quickly achieving a critical mass of vehicles on the road to sustain them.</p>
<p>Japan, Korea, India and China have promoted their domestic vehicle industry by limiting imports and exploiting the open US market, and now Japan, the most mature producer, boasts Toyota and Honda as the leaders in hybrids and greener vehicles.</p>
<p>The US should not turn to protectionism, but rather, it should use its large market to its advantage. It should require much higher mileage standards for automobiles and offer substantial product development assistance to US-based automakers and suppliers &#8211; that includes Toyota and Honda, as well as the Detroit Three, battery makers and other suppliers &#8211; to accelerate the build-out of high-mileage innovative cars.</p>
<p>The condition for assistance would be that beneficiaries do their research and development and first large production runs in the US, and share their patents at reasonable cost with one another. The huge US market would attract producers from around the world and rejuvenate the US auto supply chain.</p>
<p>Similarly, accelerating clean coal gasification, nuclear power and the hydrogen transformation, as well as mandating much more efficient buildings and home heating systems and appliances, would propagate exciting new technologies Americans could sell around the world.</p>
<p>Since January 2007, the dollar has fallen 12% against the euro, and a burst of commodity and manufactured exports have helped reduce the US non-oil trade deficit. However, as the dollar has weakened against the euro, China has stepped up its intervention in currency markets to keep its yuan inexpensive and exports growing. Factoring in higher oil prices too, the overall trade deficit is down only about $20 billion.</p>
<p>Although China has permitted the yuan to fall by 17% since July 2005, it has increased purchases of dollars with yuan to $640 billion annually in 2008, up from $462 billion in 2007. This provides a subsidy on exports and domestic import competing products equal to about 17% of China’s GDP, and pressures other Asian nations to pursue similar currency policies lest their industries lose competitiveness to Chinese manufacturers in vital US and European markets.</p>
<p>Moreover, by artificially accelerating Asian growth, this policy boosts Asian oil consumption and provides the hard currency to subsidize oil imports and domestic fuel prices, further exacerbating international oil shortages.</p>
<p>Cutting the US trade deficit with China and other Asian exporters requires that Washington find a way to persuade Beijing and other governments to end their currency market intervention.</p>
<p>Negotiations have not worked. The United States may have to resort to a tax on yuan-dollar transactions at a rate directly proportional to Chinese currency intervention to reduce imports in the near term. This would encourage China to stop intervening in currency markets and redirect investment toward more domestic consumption and investment in schools, hospitals and public infrastructure. Then the tax could be removed.</p>
<p>That may sound radical but redressing the trade deficit with China and other Asian exporters would also require major changes in American habits too.</p>
<p>As China and other foreign governments ended their purchases of dollars, US Treasury securities and private bonds, Americans would have to borrow less, save more and start living on what they earn. The US government would have to cut its budget deficit to near zero, and American households would have to save 5% to 10% of their disposable income, as opposed to the near zero levels accomplished during the recent economic expansion.</p>
<p>Getting through the current crisis requires unusual steps in credit markets. Federal efforts to route capable but currently distressed homeowners into sustainable mortgages and Federal Reserve to help the money center banks and securities firms will help avoid economic Armageddon. The same is true of Federal efforts to assist mortgage guarantors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.</p>
<p>However, achieving a sustainable economic expansion requires strong new disciplines, from loan officers on the ground to the executive suites at those New York banks. So far, federal credit market reforms have been focused on mortgage brokers and small lenders, rather than the business models pursued by the large money-center banks and securities dealers that bundle mortgages, credit-card debt and auto loans into bonds. These firms are largely locked out of the fixed-income market for the purposes of securitizing mortgages, owing to the absence of transparency in past practices and the dearth of meaning management reforms.</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve should start conditioning its discount window lending to large money-center banks and securities firms to meaningful reforms in securitization and management practices, or US credit markets will take several years to rebuild.</p>
<p>Regional banks or other financial institutions could emerge as major bundlers of mortgages and consumer and business loans for sale to insurance companies, pension funds and foreign investors, but that would take many months to effect too.</p>
<p>Either way, adequate credit to both home construction and business investment will not be available before 2010. Until then, growth will be slow, and closer to 1% than 3% per year.</p>
<p>At that point, if positive steps have been taken to encourage substantial new investments in alternative energy sources, conservation and transportation, and to substantially cut the trade deficit with China and other Asian exporters, the US economy could grow at 3.5% to 4% for quite a long time.</p>
<p>Otherwise the US economy will grow in spurts above 3%, punctuated by banking crises and periods of deleveraging. In some years, growth would exceed this rate, and for others, it would be less than 1%. Overall, the pattern will be in the range of about 2% a year or less. </p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The palpable exhaustion of conservative economic thought really is extraordinary. The evidence has been clear for years that that, at current U.S. tax levels, neither modest cuts nor modest increases has any real effect on economic growth, but the GOP&#8217;s core interest groups — rich people and corporations — want tax cuts, so that&#8217;s what they continue to offer. They&#8217;ve simply got nothing else in the tank.  And John McCain desperately wants to be president, so he&#8217;s surrendered to the flat earthers. He knows perfectly well that Grover Norquist and the Club for Growth and the cranks at the Wall Street Journal editorial page can torpedo his campaign if he doesn&#8217;t pay fealty to their mindless tax cut jihadism, so fealty he pays. He&#8217;s sort of a Manchurian candidate at this point, reciting the talking points in a monotone and hoping wearily that it&#8217;s enough for one more trip to the well. Kinda sad, really.</p></blockquote>
<p>And why would anyone vote for someone who preaches this supply-side silliness?  Oh yea – because our “fair and balanced” press continues to tell their readers that opinions as to the shape of the earth differ.</p>

                                <p>High paying bonuses are important&#8230;according to <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/15840232?video=827744894">New York Governor David Paterson</a>. Wall Street and its bonuses account for one-fifth of New York&#8217;s taxable revenue. For a bit more background, see <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN2138044020080721">New York&#8217;s economy</a><br />
<blockquote>
<p>has long been dominated by financial companies. Last year, they paid $33.2 billion in bonuses, with the average employee collecting $180,420 in bonus pay, according to the state comptroller. The 2007 total was down 2 percent from the record $33.9 billion set the previous year&#8230; </p>
<p>David Paterson said on Monday, estimating that each 10 percent reduction in bonus pay costs the state $350 million in tax revenues&#8230;. </p>
<p>Last year, they paid $33.2 billion in bonuses, with the average employee collecting $180,420 in bonus pay, according to the state comptroller.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The population of New York is approximately 19 million.</p>
<p>A very small percentage of that population carries one-fifth of the tax revenues.</p>
<p>The implications are enormous, not only for what it says about the distribution of wealth but also for what it says about who is about to pick up the tab&#8230;.to say nothing about the what it says about the difficulties New York is about to experience.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;This has finally confirmed to me that flying saucers have landed and that people from outer space are in our midst, influencing policy,&#8221; he said</p></blockquote>
<p>Is anyone surprised?</p>

                                <p>There is a strange meme in the blogsphere—most recently made <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/andrew-samwick-ponders-ancestral-party.html#714879">in comments here by Movie Guy</a>—that Obama &#8220;should have a double-digit lead over McCain at this stage as has been the case with previous presidential primaries.&#8221;  So I went searching for double-digit leads among two-person Presidential races in the past several elections.</p>
<p>August 2004 (Bush [I] v Kerry):</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SK3In2YppUI/AAAAAAAAAI8/A71LB8RT4ZQ/s1600-h/aug+2004+polls.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SK3In2YppUI/AAAAAAAAAI8/A71LB8RT4ZQ/s400/aug+2004+polls.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Not a double-digit lead among them.  How about 2000? </p>
<p>Bush v Gore, per <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/9898/2000-Presidential-Election-MidYear-Gallup-Report.aspx">Gallup</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SK3JNAMOQ1I/AAAAAAAAAJE/SWPVhKIarKs/s1600-h/pr000622PresRace.gif"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SK3JNAMOQ1I/AAAAAAAAAJE/SWPVhKIarKs/s400/pr000622PresRace.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A severe outlier early, and another slight outlier (almost ten points, but not quite) later on, but still no sustained double-digit leads. Maybe 1996?</p>
<p>Clinton [I] v Dole, <a href="http://library.law.columbia.edu/urlmirror/CLR/100CLR524/ptpreselec.html">Gallup Poll Trends</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SK3LIBSqhfI/AAAAAAAAAJM/aRn725XgTa0/s1600-h/1996clintondoleonly.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SK3LIBSqhfI/AAAAAAAAAJM/aRn725XgTa0/s400/1996clintondoleonly.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>A-HA! There is it; the source of the belief that one should have &#8220;double-digit&#8221; leads.  A popular, <em>incumbent</em> president (&#8220;longest peace-time economic expansion in history&#8221;) running for re-election against a man who doesn&#8217;t even seem to be trying hard. (Ask &#8220;Hideo Nomo of the Brooklyn Dodgers.&#8221;)</p>
<p>But, oops.  It&#8217;s also <em>not the whole story</em>.  The whole story for 1996 runs more like Clinton (I) v Dole and Perot:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SK3Nk7IiiDI/AAAAAAAAAJU/XVHR44prVFA/s1600-h/1996clintondoleperot.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SK3Nk7IiiDI/AAAAAAAAAJU/XVHR44prVFA/s400/1996clintondoleperot.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Again, Clinton is a popular, incumbent President (all things Obama is not) running against a man who is increasingly making it clear he doesn&#8217;t want the job (and a man whose candidacy was widely seen as equivalent to a &#8220;protest vote&#8221; against, e.g., NAFTA).  So it seems reasonable to assume that many of the &#8220;undecideds&#8221; were not going to break his way and were deciding which protest vote was more reasonable.</p>
<p>But MG may suggest that I am politically naive to suggest that all of the Undecideds would break away from Clinton, and he&#8217;s probably correct.  But it similarly seems reasonable to assume that a notable majority would break that way—say, 75% of the undecideds.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SK3P9KGHaxI/AAAAAAAAAJc/yUZPd7rIKCk/s1600-h/1996clintondoleperot75pct.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SK3P9KGHaxI/AAAAAAAAAJc/yUZPd7rIKCk/s400/1996clintondoleperot75pct.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So even a popular incumbent cannot sustain a double-digit lead (though the negatives would still, of course, leave him winning with a large plurality of the vote—which is what happened).  And the only times we see a convincing double-digit lead is when a substantial third-party candidate is excluded from the polling, and one of the candidates is a popular Incumbent.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong; I agree with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/18/opinion/18krugman.html?ei=5124&#038;en=6eda987d8bc84fed&#038;ex=1376798400&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink&#038;pagewanted=print">Paul Krugman</a> (contra <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/08/peddling-anti-obamaism.html">lerxst</a>) that Obama&#8217;s campaign isn&#8217;t so appealing as it could and should be.  But in a two-party race* with neither candidate being the Incumbent,** expectations of a sustained double-digit lead, even over a short period of time, are absurd.</p>
<p>*Pending evidence of a large groundswell for Bob Barr and <a href="http://www.rootforamerica.com/">One of Obama&#8217;s Classmates</a> on the Libertarian line or a rally amongst pro-Prohibition forces in the face of the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/mukasey-rules-schools-not-to-send-your.html">Amethyst Initiative</a>.<br />**In name, at least.</p>

<p>In a spirit of cooperation, I have lifted this post from Tim Schilling (economist and Asst. Dir. Powell Institute) blog MV=PQ.  It is geared for a lesson plan and material for a high school economic class (gr. 12).  Please comment with that in mind.  Of course any of this is used in history, current events, government, presidential campaign perusal, and a long list of other.<br />
<blockquote>Monday, August 11, 2008<br /><a href="http://valuingeconomics.blogspot.com/2008/08/critical-reading-of-economics.html"><strong>Critical Reading of Economics </strong></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve run across an interesting piece that is worth sharing with you. Whether it&#8217;s worth sharing with your students, I&#8217;ll leave to your judgment. You&#8217;re the one in your classroom. </p>
<p>Let me start by saying the source of the article, <em>City Journal</em>, is the product of a conservative think-tank. Consequently, it has a very definite slant. I haven&#8217;t read <em>City Journal </em>before today, but the article has some uses in the classroom in terms of teaching students to be critical thinkers. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.city-journal.org/2008/18_3_economics.html">Economics Does Not Lie</a> is an interesting title for an article, whatever you might think about the subject and its application. My main interest in the article (HT to <a href="http://www.aldaily.com/">Arts &#038; Letters Daily</a>) was the list of 10 propositions in economics it contains. It is fascinating to see what others feel are the important &#8220;truths&#8221; in any field. This blog has visited the topic before, and the article gave one more view. I won&#8217;t bother you by listing the propositions, you can read them yourselves, but I will make a couple comments and then a suggestion for use with your students. </p>
<p>Early in the article, the author, Guy Sorman, speaks about &#8220;precise (though not infallible) mathematical models.&#8221; While I&#8217;m sure he said what he meant, my feeling is that many would argue whether the models would be more helpful if they were accurate, as opposed to being precise. There&#8217;s little value in being precisely wrong. (In fact there&#8217;s an old joke about decimals being invented so economists demonstrate their sense of humor.) </p>
<p>In the first proposition, he also states that the market economy is the most efficient of all economic systems. While true, I think many people become more concerned with equity than efficiency. Of course, the fact that there are multiple definitions of equity may be part of the issue. </p>
<p>Research in decision-making plays an important part in the explanation of the third statement. Sorman refers to recent research that indicates our short-term choices are made in a different part of the brain than long-term choices. He also points out that short-run decisions are often the most prone to mistakes. Given the tendency for many non-economists to fall back on Keynes&#8217; statement about our condition in the long-run when discussing economic policy, I find this interesting. </p>
<p>The seventh statement deals with labor costs and unemployment. It does not mention technology. But labor costs are related to technology through productivity. It is the ability of labor to access and use technology that makes labor more productive. On the one hand technology can reduce costs, but it often comes with higher wages for more skilled workers. </p>
<p>The ninth statement addresses complex financial markets and economic progress. This is risky given the current environment. Yet, I think it is a valid and important point. If U.S. financial markets were concentrated and isolated, without the ability to spread risk, I suspect the current slowdown could have been much worse. Now, that doesn&#8217;t make those institutions and individuals from other countries happy that they got stuck holding questionable securities. But again, take the cost and concentrate it, and the U.S. economic picture looks worse yet. And with other nations trade so dependent on the U.S., a worse slowdown here could still have international repurcussions. </p>
<p>So how is this used to promote critical thinking? Let me first direct you to two definitions from The Economist. <a href="http://www.economist.com/research/economics/alphabetic.cfm?letter=P#positiveeconomics">Positive economics</a> is based on what is. <a href="http://www.economist.com/research/economics/alphabetic.cfm?letter=N#normativeeconomics">Normative economics</a> is based on what we would like to see. I think an article like this would be great to have your students read, looking for positive vs. normative statements. I think research would support many (not all) of the propositions as positive. I think the support of these statements frequently depends on normative statements. This exercise can be very relevant in a period where we are asked to make choices that can affect our economic future. </p>
<p>What are your thoughts? </p></blockquote>
<p>Our friend William Polley was just over there to comment on <a href="http://valuingeconomics.blogspot.com/2008/08/marginal-thinking-in-olympics.html">Marginal thinking in the Olympics</a> regarding false starts between swimmers and track and field.  Much more concrete than we are used to, but I think valuable when considering voters.  </p>

<p>I gave up on the Party long ago; I gave up hope when a (very) distant relative wrote an op-ed for the NYT on why he would not support impeachment in 1998, and was attacked by the party for the next few years, before he chose not to run for re-election in 2004. But if this is really the platform of a Republican Presidential candidate:<br />
<blockquote>1.  Energy Independence. <br />   2. Tax Reform. <br />   3. Border Security.<br />   4. Life. <br />   5. Defending Marriage.</p></blockquote>
<p>then I&#8217;m around to agreeing with Brad DeLong: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/08/impeach-george.html">Shut it down</a>.  See if you can build something sane.</p>

                                <p>David Ignatius argues that McCain likes <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/19/AR2008081902257_pf.html">zingers</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>McCain likes zingers. We&#8217;ve all seen that mischievous look &#8212; just before he shot a quip or sarcastic one-liner at GOP rivals such as former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney. It&#8217;s one of his appealing qualities, but in this case it worries me. Zingers don&#8217;t make good foreign policy. They embolden friends and provoke adversaries &#8212; and in the Georgia crisis, that has proved to be a deadly combination.  In the aftermath of the Georgia war, many commentators have argued that the mercurial Saakashvili walked into a trap by launching an attack Aug. 7 on the South Ossetian capital of Tskhinvali &#8212; providing the pretext for the brutal Russian response. That conclusion emerges from a meticulous reconstruction by The Post&#8217;s Peter Finn. So what encouraged Saakashvili to make his reckless gamble? Partly it was the ambivalent policy of the Bush administration, which told the Georgian leader one month that &#8220;We always fight for our friends&#8221; (as Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said in July in Tbilisi about Georgia&#8217;s bid to join NATO) and the next month cautioned restraint. And partly it was cheerleading from the pro-Georgia lobby, in which McCain has been one of the loudest voices. Let&#8217;s put aside the fact that McCain&#8217;s top foreign policy adviser, Randy Scheunemann, has in fact been a lobbyist for Georgia. In his own feisty comments in recent months, McCain encouraged Georgians to believe America would back them up in a crisis. That expectation was naive, and it was wrong to encourage it. It was especially wrong to give a volatile leader such as Saakashvili what he evidently imagined was an American blank check. In the post-Cold War world, small countries often get into fights they can&#8217;t finish &#8212; hoping that big powers will come to their rescue. That happened in the 1990s with Bosnia and Kosovo, which hoped their desperate vulnerability would force Western intervention, as it eventually did. On the other side, the Serbs played the same game, hoping (wrongly, as it turned out) that Russia would intervene. The better part of wisdom sometimes is to tell small, embattled nations and ethnic groups: Swallow your pride and compromise; the cavalry isn&#8217;t coming to save you. There&#8217;s a moral problem with all the pro-Georgia cheerleading, which has gotten lost in the op-ed blasts against Putin&#8217;s neo-imperialism. A recurring phenomenon of the early Cold War was that America encouraged oppressed peoples to rise up and fight for freedom &#8212; and then, when things got rough, abandoned them to their fate. The CIA did that egregiously in the early 1950s, broadcasting to the Soviet republics and the nations of Eastern Europe that America would back their liberation from Soviet tyranny. After the brutal suppression of the Hungarian revolution in 1956, responsible U.S. leaders learned to be more cautious, and more honest about the limits of American power. Now, after the Georgia war, McCain should learn that lesson: American leaders shouldn&#8217;t make threats the country can&#8217;t deliver or promises it isn&#8217;t prepared to keep. The rhetoric of confrontation may make us feel good, but other people end up getting killed.</p></blockquote>
