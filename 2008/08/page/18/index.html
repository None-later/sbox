                                                                    </div>

                                <p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/opinions/forbes/2008/0811/025.html">Ernesto Zedillo</a> provides an insightful discussion on the causes of higher food prices, which includes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is clear, however, that the most damaging distortions in agricultural markets originate in rich countries. There&#8217;s little doubt that the present spiral in grain prices is closely linked to U.S. and EU policies enacted to boost production of biofuels. The American and European governments subsidize the production of biofuels, limit their import and mandate their use. The exact extent to which these policies have impacted food prices is still a matter of contention, but not even the most enthusiastic proponents of ethanol can deny that by inducing a greater allocation of agricultural resources toward biofuel production, the amount of grain available for food has been reduced. According to the World Bank, while global production of corn increased by 51 million tons from 2004 to 2007, biofuel use of corn in the U.S. alone increased by 50 million tons, thus leaving no margin to satisfy the increase of 33 million tons in global consumption for other uses during the same period. This explains why some respectable experts, such as the former chief economist for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and a top World Bank agricultural economist, have imputed a large proportion of the rise in food prices to the growing use of food crops for fuel.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hat tip to <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/08/why-food-prices-are-rising.html">Greg Mankiw</a> who is suggesting that Barack Obama should reconsider his support for corn based biofuel production.</p>
<p>Update: Movie Guy points us to <a href="http://www.zealllc.com/2008/grains.htm">Zeal Speculation and Investment</a> for another discussion of food prices:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the last several decades a whole slew of factors have provided catalysts for the rise of the grains.  With one of the largest being the lack of material growth in the agricultural industry.  And considering the long-time behavior of grains prices, it is understandable why there has been little incentive to grow this industry. When the price of any good or service grinds sideways for decades on end while the rest of the world is inflating away, this tends to harbor dismal growth prospects.  And this is typically not an encouraging environment for capital investment.  In fact if the fruits of the land are not as appealing as an offer from a commercial developer, a prudent business operator will take the money and run. While technology improvements over the years have indeed enabled better crop yields, according to the US Department of Agriculture the US planted area for the major crops has dropped by nearly 15% since 1980 … The simple fact is the world’s population continues to grow, and so does the demand for staple foods.  So with the primary end product of grains being food, supply needs to keep up with growing demand.  And it is not!  Supplies have been growing, but not sufficiently enough to meet demand growth.  And to put a twist into this supply/demand imbalance, segmented economic prosperity is also changing the dynamics of the grains trade.  Economic growth in the world’s developing nations has and will cause extra strains on the grains.  As more and more people add protein and other valuable nutrients to their diets, grains demand will continue to gain strength … As will be apparent in the long-term charts the grains have been range-bound in sideways trend channels for the better part of the last four decades.  Every so often there were strong rallies that elevated prices, but they quickly fell back within trend.  But what we are seeing in the last couple years are major breakouts from these trends.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nominal prices stay relatively constant and then they doubled over the past few years – what’s wrong with this story?  Go further down and look at the last three graphs showing the relative prices of corn, wheat, and soybeans from 1970 to today.  Relative prices spiked in the early 1970’s and then fell quite dramatically over time.  As the charts show, real prices really are not that high compared to where they were in 1970.  Oh well, it was a neat story until we adjusted for inflation!</p>

                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://nymag.com/news/politics/powergrid/48928">John Heilemann</a> suggests that John McCain once thought about a real campaign free of the usual GOP mudslinging but then this decision was made:</p>
<blockquote><p>But Weaver, Murphy, and McKinnon are no longer guiding McCain. Instead, the motor behind his operation now is Steve Schmidt, the shaven-headed strategist who earned his bones running Karl Rove’s war room in 2004, Frenchifying and de-war-heroizing John Kerry. What Schmidt and his associates have apparently concluded is that McCain’s weaknesses—on the election’s most salient issues and as a candidate—are so pronounced and Obama’s vulnerabilities so glaring that the low road is their guy’s best, and maybe only, route to the White House. They’ve concluded, in other words, that even if McCain may not be able to win the election in any affirmative sense, he might still wind up behind the big desk if he and his people can strip the bark off Obama with sufficiently vicious force.</p></blockquote>
<p>Once Schmidt was running the show, the path was clear:</p>
<blockquote><p>For those not keeping score, a quick review of the McCain campaign’s lunge for Obama’s jugular. First, its new slogan: “Country first,” with its inverse insinuation that Obama puts something else (i.e., his own ambition) ahead of the nation. Second, McCain’s accusation that Obama “would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign.” Third, the McCain ad “Troops,” which claims that Obama, while in Germany, “made time to go the gym, but canceled a visit with wounded troops—seems the Pentagon wouldn’t allow him to bring cameras.” And, finally, the ad “Celeb,” with its intercut images of Obama in Berlin, Paris Hilton, and Britney Spears.  The strategy behind all this isn’t hard to discern: Drive up Obama’s negatives and render him unacceptable to pivotal voting blocs. Thus the depiction of him as too young, too feckless, and too pampered to be president. (In almost every shot in the McCain ads, Obama is smiling flashily, whereas McCain is pictured as weathered, sober, staring hard into the distance—a clever bit of jujitsu, using Obama’s pretty mug against him.) Thus the portrayal of him as precious, self-infatuated, and effete: “Only celebrities like Barack Obama go to the gym three times a day, demand ‘MET-RX chocolate roasted-peanut protein bars and bottles of a hard-to-find organic brew—Black Forest Berry Honest Tea’ and worry about the price of arugula,” wrote campaign manager Rick Davis in an e-mail announcing “Celeb.” And thus the emphasis on Obama’s rock-star persona, designed to engender envy and contempt among the swath of Middle America for which hipness is no virtue but a sign of pretension.  The racial undertones of this assault are subtle but undeniable, as Obama himself suggested when he asserted last week that his opponents are trying to make voters “scared” of him because he “doesn’t look like the other presidents on the currency.” They’re most glaring in “Troops,” which features footage of Obama sinking a three-pointer in Kuwait, despite the fact that the shot took place at a military base, which undermines the ad’s argument. But the spot’s deeper aim is to foster an unconscious simile: Obama as a blinged-up, camera-hungry, NBA shooting guard, Allen Iverson with a Harvard Law degree. Am I reaching? Consider this: Would the ad have featured footage of Obama on a golf course draining a hole-in-one? “No, it wouldn’t,” laughs a GOP media savant. “The racial angle is the first thing I thought of when I saw that ad. It fits into the celebrity stuff, too.” (For McCain, that impolitic, pro-Obama Ludacris track was manna from hip-hop heaven.)</p></blockquote>
<p>Team McCain has the audacity for saying Obama played the race card.  All part of the Schmidt strategy.  Schmidt’s garbage got the worst President in my lifetime reelected in 2004 and the GOP hope is that this garbage will do the trick again.  Folks who complain about this gutter politics should think twice for voting for Schmidt’s client – even if you happen to agree with something McCain has said on the real issues.  Besides, if you don’t agree with what he said about an issue recently – just wait, he’ll flip-flop to a policy position you like just before he hurls some other dishonest smear at Obama.  After all &#8211; he earlier said he wanted to run a clean campaign but then he hired Steve Schmidt.</p>

                                <p>Time to knock this one down before it gets started.</p>
<p>Over at Andrew Bigg&#8217;s blog he has a post up called <a href="http://andrewgbiggs.blogspot.com/2008/07/academy-of-actuaries-raise-retirement.html">Academy of Actuaries: Raise the Retirement Age</a>. I am not particularly concerned with the text quoted which actually amounts to some AP guy&#8217;s take on an advance copy of what the Academy will actually release. &#8216;Bankrupt&#8217; is as likely to have just come out of reporter Holland&#8217;s head than the actual text. What I am concerned about is a number and a concept that popped up in comments there.</p>
<p>First we have commenter Jim Glass defining the overall problem as follows:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;d for once like to see some group come out and specify the problems to be fixed first. Then relate its fix to those problems.</p>
<p>There are a bunch of problems, e.g.:<br />* Long term actuarial balance.<br />* Cash flow problems in the 2020s, when cash needed for the trust fund on top of all that for Medicare, Medicaid, etc., is very likley to cause program re-writes that make today&#8217;s long-term actuarial projections (and fixes) irrelevant.<br />* The economic loss forced on the young by the $17t &#8220;backward transfer&#8221;, that protends loss of future political support for SS.<br />* Spreading that loss to the young (inevitable as it is) equitably among generations.<br />* The decline in the &#8220;progressive social insurance&#8221; nature of SS due to the just-above points.</p></blockquote>
<p> Then Biggs comes along and states in part:<br />
<blockquote>Regarding whether it&#8217;s fair, as strange as it sounds, in one sense fairness isn&#8217;t really the issue. The future Social Security shortfall is a function of over-generosity to past participants and unfavorable demographic projections going forward </p></blockquote>
<p>. Note that Biggs does not dispute the $17 trillion &#8220;backward transfer&#8221; but instead implicitly allows it to be equated with &#8220;over-generosity to past particpants&#8221;. But I think I want to cry &#8216;bullshit&#8217; on the whole notion. A copy of my comment to that thread appears under the fold.</p>
<blockquote><p>Jim Glass could you clarify some of your comments? For example when I look at the following table I just don&#8217;t see any major &#8220;cash flow problem in the 2020s&#8221;. <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/TR08/VI_OASDHI_dollars.html#140103">Table VI.F7.—Operations of the Combined OASI and DI Trust Funds, in Constant 2008 Dollars, Calendar Years 2008-85 [In billions].</a> Instead I see a gap in 2025 of about $170 billion in 2008 dollars or not much more than the cost of the current stimulus package. The notion that a similar borrowing need in 2025 will bring the bond market to its knees could use some explication.</p>
<p>Plus I am a little confused about the &#8220;$17 t &#8220;backward transfer&#8221;&#8221;. First I have no idea where the $17 trillion figure comes from. Oops full stop.</p>
<p>I now see that the $17.4 trillion comes from Table IV.B7. But the methodology seems odd. <br />&#8220;The first line of table IV.B7 shows that the present value of future cost less future taxes over the next 100 years for all current participants equals $17.4 trillion. For this purpose, current participants are defined as individuals who attain age 15 or older in 2008.&#8221;<br />What? Why 100 years rather than the standard 75 years or alternately Infinite Future? Using the former we would be capturing all &#8220;current participants&#8221; whose life expectancies are 90 years or less which is to say almost everyone. But that would give us a PV of future cost over future tax of $6.5 trillion which if reduced by the 2007 year end value of the TF would give us a total unfunded liability of $4.3 trillion (per Table IV.B4). On the other hand if we extended this to Infinite Future we end up with PV of future cost over future tax of $15.8 trillion which reduced by the current TF balance gives a unfunded liability of $13.6 trillion. Instead we seem to have an arbitrary figure of 100 years which manages to tack $10.9 trillion in excess costs during the period 2083 to 2108. No &#8216;current participant&#8217; as defined will be contributing taxes in that period and the youngest person drawing benefits at its inception will be 90 years old. To call this a &#8216;backward transfer&#8217; is kind of bizaare. It is fair to say that no current beneficiary will be drawing a check in 2083 (62 plus 75 = 137). As for current contributers the youngest Boomer will be 119 in that year (2083-1964), the youngest Gen-X 101 (2083-1982). Sticking us for a near $11 trillion extra tab that doesn&#8217;t start coming due for 75 years seems kind of a stretch.</p>
<p>And Andrew seems to share this with his &#8220;over-generorisity to past participants&#8221;. Given that the Trust Funds never actually went to zero and are sitting at $2.3 trillion today clearly there was no over-generosity for those past participants who are now deceased, they paid their way and then some. And considering that SS income and the principal in the TF are currently scheduled to fund full benefits until 2041 it is hard to blame any current beneficiaries, the youngest (early retirement in 2008 at age 62) of them will be 100 in 2041.</p>
<p>So I am not buying into the premise. Plus I find it interesting that per Table IV.B7 the PV of cost less taxes for all future participants is actually a negative $1.5 trillion. Making it look like $17.4 trillion was simply picked as representing the scariest number possible. I&#8217;ll accept some responsibility for the $6.5 trillion gap between projected future cost over future income between now and 2082 (but I do want credit for the $2.3 trillion in the Trust Funds). And this even though I don&#8217;t expect to be around after 2041. But I simply see no reason to accept any responsibility for contingent outcomes over the period 2082 to 2108.</p></blockquote>
<p> It is bad enough that they were able to slip Infinite Future Horizon into this debate. To deliberately single out a particular 25 year period starting 75 years from now and taking its projected imbalance between income and cost as somehow being the responsibility of &#8216;past participants&#8217; is preposterous special pleading. Or someone can convince me otherwise in comments.</p>
<p>But in any event you can expect this &#8216;$17 trillion backward transfer&#8217; to start popping up everywhere and I wanted to give everyone a heads up.</p>

<p>2slugs pointed out that in June all the drop in employment was teens as employment of over 25s actually rose.  He was right, but as I looked at the data what it shows is this seems to be a normal cyclical pattern.  In the 1982, 1990 and 20000 recessions employment growth for over 25 year olds either remained positive or barely turned negative while teen employment fell over 10% in those recessions.  Interestingly, in the 1982 and 1990 recessions there were minimum wage increases but in 2000 the minimum wage was unchanged.  So you have three recessions were teen employment fell over 10%.  Twice there were minimum wage hikes and once there was no change in the minimum wage.   This minimum wage was in the mid-1990s, when there was no recession and teen employment remained positive.  So what is the causal relationship here,<br />do recessions cause teen employment to fall or is it minimum wage hikes?</p>
<p>Also note that while we are getting widespread comments about the current minimum wage hike creating teen employment so far ,if this is a recession scenario, teen employment is actually stronger than it was in previous cycles while adult employment growth appears the same as in previous cycles.</p>
<p>But this data sure seems to make it as clear as mud whether minimum wage hikes or economic cycles causes teen employment to fall.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just trying to be honest about what the data says.  But, obviously there are a lot of people out there that are less than honest about the causal relationships here.</p>
<p>P.S. the grey line at the top of the chart is the minimum wage charted on the right axis.  It is just there so you can see when the minimum wage hikes happened.</p>

<p>If all goes well, I hope to blog about it on Tuesday.  If all does not go well, I&#8217;ll be blogging it sometime after the opening ceremonies of the Tiananmen Olympics.</p>

                                <p>Ah something which I actually know something about.</p>
<p>Dana Goldstein <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/tapped_archive?month=08&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=a_comparison_of_two_suburban_h">has found an amazing fact</a> which, if middle class parents believed it was representative, would make the world (and in particular the USA) a much better place</p>
<blockquote><p>So were the litigious Fairfax parents correct to freak out about South Lakes? Let&#8217;s look at the numbers.</p>
<p>At South Lakes High, 46 percent of students are white, 20 percent are black, 16 percent are Hispanic, and 11 percent are Asian. One-third of the school&#8217;s population qualifies for free or reduced-price lunch. In other words, this is both a racially and socioeconomically diverse school. How does this affect the most academically talented/privileged proportion of the student body? Well, more than half of white kids and almost half of Asian kids participate in the IB program, as do about 20 percent of blacks and Hispanics. An overwhelming majority of all the students enrolled in IB score a 4 or better, indicating excellent instruction and achievement. As for the SAT, the average combined score for white kids at South Lakes is 1730 out of 2400.</p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at Oakton High School, which affluent parents sued to get their kids into. Oakton is 67 percent white and only 11 percent black and Hispanic. Less than 9 percent of students there qualify for free or reduced-price lunch. Oakton has an AP program in which white students are just as successful as their similar white peers at South Lakes are on the IB exams; of the black students participating in AP though, less than half scored three or higher. Tellingly, on the SAT, Oakton&#8217;s white kids score 1734, essentially the exact same score as white students at South Lakes.</p>
<p>My point: The educational outcomes of privileged kids are remarkably similar across schools with similar curricula, while it is the least advantaged students who show more differentials. When parents are considering where to send their kids to school, they should look at the relevant numbers.</p></blockquote>
<p>via <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=the_problems_with_parents&#038;10">Ezra Klein.</a></p>
<p>Sad to say, the whole world isn&#8217;t Fairfax county (well that would be a very boring world, ethnicly diverse but culturally a bit focused on US politics).  In most developed countries, average educational attainment of mothers of students is positively partially correlated (positive significant regression coefficient) with individual student performance (on the PISA test) even if the educational attainment of the student&#8217;s parents is included in the regression.</p>

<blockquote><p>The unemployment rate rose to 5.7 percent, and nonfarm payroll employment continued to trend down in July (-51,000)</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the BLS also claimed that the employment-population ratio (EP) remained at 62.4% and the labor force participation rate (LFP) remained at 66.1% &#8211; one might be wondering how the unemployment ratio rose.  It seems EP fell from 62.446% to 62.352, while LFP rose from 66.084% to 66.108%.  Gotta watch those rounding of numbers.  </p>
<p>While the decline in the employment-population ratio was modest last month, this ratio has declined from 63.4% as of December 2006 and from 64.4% as of December 2000.   The unemployment rate today is higher than it was as of December 2000 even though the labor force participation rate has declined from 67% to 66.1%.  Somehow, however, I bet the White House paints another one of its Pollyanna portraits of this weak labor market.</p>

                                <p>Compared to other cycles the drop in employment this cycle looks perfectly normal, as it is right on the average of the four pre-1990 cycles.  The real question is how long employment continues to fall and there was little or nothing in the recent economic data to suggest that employment is on the verge of bottoming.  This is especially true when you look at the last two weeks large increases in initial unemployment claims.  These large jumps in claims occurred after the data  was collected for the employment report and suggest that employment will fall again next month.</p>

The hours worked data incorporates both the job loses and the sharp rise in part time employment we are seeing this cycle.  But the hours worked data appears to be accelerating on the downside.  It clearly suggest that we are starting the third quarter on a very weak note.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SJMWAf8A_ZI/AAAAAAAAAUs/htkbbERhjfs/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SJMWAf8A_ZI/AAAAAAAAAUs/htkbbERhjfs/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>The Fed is reportedly worried about wage growth, but my model says that weakness in the economy is more than offsetting the rise in inflation expectations and employees desire to offset recent inflation with larger wage gains.  There is essentially no evidence of the start of a wage-price spiral.<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SJMWJRzFfTI/AAAAAAAAAU0/11P_Xlk1TyM/s1600-h/Clipboard04.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SJMWJRzFfTI/AAAAAAAAAU0/11P_Xlk1TyM/s320/Clipboard04.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Finally, the combination of slowing wage growth and falling hours worked means that nominal wage and salary growth is slowing sharply.  So the critical question becomes where will the consumer get the real income to finance increases in consumer spending.  Maybe a collapse of oil and food prices could do that, but so far the weakness in oil and other commodity prices does not appear sufficient to generate large increases in real income.</p>
