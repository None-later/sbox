<p>Nouriel Roubini, in a post entitled <a href="http://www.rgemonitor.com/roubini-monitor/253323/the_decline_of_the_american_empire">Decline of the American Empire</a>, outlines four developments, marking the beginning of the end of the American Empire. The unique position of the U.S. as the sole &#8220;unipolar&#8221; power, he asserts, has been lost; America may now be in irretrievable decline.</p>
<p>Before I review Nouriel&#8217;s observations, let me two of my own. First, though America may yet pull its bacon out of the fire, any post mortem of its decline will, in all likelihood, lay the causes at the feet of U.S. policy, economic and military. </p>
<p>Second, America has&#8211;through its multinationals and managerial talent, its economic power, its science and universities&#8211;seeded the world, made possible the success of its rivals. As one of the prime architects and movers of globalization, America has inadvertently laid the foundation for the torch to be passed. Nouriel makes a good case for American decline. Consider:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>First, the US squandered its power by relying excessively on its hard military power in the wars of Iraq and Afghanistan and in its unilateralist foreign policy – including economic issues such as global warming &#8211; rather than relying more on its soft power of diplomacy and multilateralist approaches to global policy issues.
</p>
<p>Second, regardless of mistaken US policies the rise of other economic and financial powers&#8230;that the relative economic, financial and geopolitical power of the US will be reduced over time
</p>
<p>Third, and more important, the US squandered its economic and financial power by running reckless economic policies, especially its twin fiscal and current account deficits.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fourth, Nouriel notes that:</p>
<blockquote><p>the economic powers financing the US twin deficits are the strategic rivals of the US – China and Russia – and unstable petro-states, i.e., Saudi Arabia, the Gulf States and other shaky petro-states. This system of vendor financing – with these US creditors providing both the goods being imported and the financing of such deficits – has led to a balance of financial terror: if these creditors were to pull the plug on the financing of the US twin deficits the dollar would collapse and US interest rates would go through the roof. </p></blockquote>
<p>As the U.S. goes deeper and deeper in debt, it is transferring enormous wealth its rivals. I would include the &#8220;unstable petro-states&#8221; as rivals as well. There is certainly significant tension between Islamic states and America. Though some may seem to be friendly, even the friendly ones have harbored and ecouraged elements that are anything but friendly to the U.S. It is hard to forget, for example, the madrassas in Saudi Arabia that spawned many of the Taliban and the 911 bombers.</p>
<p>Furthermore,<br />
<blockquote>&#8230; foreign creditors of the US are getting tired of financing the US in the form of low-yielding US Treasuries. Thus the switch of such reserve holdings to SWFs that are planning to make large equity investments possibly with actual control of corporate firms and financial institutions that are desperate for capital to recapitalize themselves</p></blockquote>
<p>As many have noted, there is a price the U.S. must pay for its growing debt: Its assets. Sovereign Wealth Funds in the Middle East, China, and elsewhere will invest heavily in or outright buy American corporations financial institutions. They have the cash. While America may get desperately needed tax dollars in such purchases or investments, those purchases will not significantly lower our debt. We will lose the assets and keep the debt&#8211;a real spiraling down. The twin deficits will remain. Furthermore, those companies&#8211;and all their assets and know-how&#8211;may now serve new masters, masters whose goals we may well not share.</p>
<p>Nouriel notes that although it is unlikely that any of our creditors will suddenly &#8220;pull&#8221; the financial rug from beneath our feet; nonetheless, America is<br />
<blockquote>vulnerable to such rivals using the financial terror weapon – dumping US assets and or reducing their financing of the US twin deficits – in situations of geostrategic tension.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Suppose Russia flexes further its muscle in its backyard – under the pretense of defending abused Russian minorities in Ukraine, the Baltics and other former Soviet Union or Iron Curtain countries. Then Russia could use its financial power – the ability to dump hundreds of billions of dollar assets – to exert both financial and military influence. So could China over time if trouble in Taiwan or other disputed Asian territories become big geopolitical issues. Russia and China are already winning the new war for the control of commodities and ressources through their investments in Africa and Latin America &#8211; in the case of China – and its domestic and foreign control of energy and pipelines in Central Asia in the case of Russia. China and Russia are indeed winning the new Scramble for Resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nouriel expects the dollar as the main reserve currency to be challenged.<br />
<blockquote>Already Russia is flexing its muscle and pushing for an international role of the ruble; the euro is rising as a major reserve currency; central banks and SWFs will slowly but surely start to diversify away from dollar assets especially as the Bretton Woods 2 regime starts to unravel&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>If Nouriel is correct, how did all of this come to pass?</p>
<p>Certainly, the Iraq War has been a disaster in terms of cost, goodwill, lives, and attention. By &#8220;attention&#8221; I mean America&#8217;s obsession with it. That American raw power cannot tame two third-world states in less time than it took the allies to defeat the axis powers in WWII says it all. Perhaps it did not have &#8220;will&#8221; to do so. Whatever the causes, it has failed miserably. Caesar would have been stunned.</p>
<p>As I said, Iraq has been America&#8217;s obsession; meanwhile it pursued policies concerning energy, regulation, consumerism and trade that have proven disastrous. Its lack of its decades long coherent energy policy is obvious. That it espoused a freewheeling marketplace with minimum oversight is also obvious.</p>
<p>The centerpieces of its failure lie, I think, in its relentless consumerism, encourage by incessant and ubiquitous advertising, easy credit, and its disastrous trade policy. Bush stuck the tone of the decade when he urged America to shop after 911. A good trip to the mall will cure anything, including, I guess, fear of Saddam sending over nukes or the twin towers falling.</p>
<p>As one of the most significant forces in the last decade, globalization must be playing a role in America&#8217;s decline. America was one of its prime movers&#8211;and America&#8217;s fate must be tied inexorably to is development.</p>
<p>Certainly, America would not knowingly create the engine of its own decline. Certainly, its economists would have warned it. Many economists were quite happy with America&#8217;s future in a global marketplace. Are they surprised at the latest turn of events? Staggering twin deficits, a burgeoning trade deficit, loss of manufacturing&#8230;.</p>
<p>Was it mismanaged or was it happenstance that America&#8217;s decline coincided with its rise?<br />For a moment, let us grant that Nouriel is correct that America is in decline and continue with the post mortem, speaking as if we were future historians that saw a connection between globalization and America&#8217;s decline.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Americans were encouraged to be consumers, even as its trade deficit increased, even as its companies, one after another set up shop in countries with cheap and unprotected labor, low taxation, and weak environmental regulations. Walmart, which used to brag about &#8220;Made in America,&#8221; was the iconic symbol of what happened.</p>
<p>American manufacturing slowly wilted; its trade deficit increased. It outsourced goods and services in order to feed the consumerism encouraged at home. American corporations and financial institutions were all too happy to usher China into the WTO, along with other ripe export platforms. Bucks were to be made; goods were to be sold. The American consumer would keep the party going.</p>
<p>Globalization from the start was disjointed. One country, America, became the consumer of last resort. Emerging economies became producers of first resort. Emerging economies were not &#8220;emerging markets&#8221;; they were export platforms. America sent its production skills to these countries.</p>
<p>(Now, China may well become a future marketplace, but companies initially did not go there with that in mind.) How China played the game of globalization was intelligent and direct. Feeding off the American consumer and the foreign corporations it attracted, keeping its currency pegged for as long as possible, and keeping its labor force as unprotected and as cheap as possible for as long as possible, China gathered the cash to build its infrastructure and buy the resources for the long century ahead.</p>
<p>Foreign corporations in China liked the pegged yuan. Mismatched currencies added even more profits. Indeed, for a while the stock market soared, even as American wages stagnated. Similarly, foreign companies in China enjoyed unprotected and cheap labor. Similarly, those companies enjoyed the weak environmental regulations. Even if those companies claimed that they or their Chinese associates did not pollute, they did profit from the cheaper energy, a direct result of weak or non-existent environmental regulations.</p>
<p>Nouriel ends with one observation with which I do not agree:<br />
<blockquote>the brief period of unipolar power of the American hyperpower is now over and a new age of balance of great powers is starting in the world. Also, the rise of non governmental actors – multinational corporations, NGOs, terrorist groups, non-nation state powers, failed and unstable states, non-traditional global players – will radically change the traditional balance of power as the <i>power of nation states will shrink relative to that of other global players.</i></p></blockquote>
<p>[Italics mine.]</p>
<p>China will not shrink; neither will Russia; neither will, for example, Brazil. Terrorist groups may set up shop in places like Afghanistan, but unless they get nukes (Pakistan), they will not be much of a threat. No, countries are still the fruit de jour. It was always a mercantilist pipedream that it could be otherwise. Wealth and power has shifted back to command economies: Russia, China, Saudi Arabia.</p>
<p>These countries do and will continue to own the important corporations, corporations that control resources and important means of production: Aluminum Corporation of China and China Offshore Oil Corporation, for example. China may relax its grip on companies that deal in consumer goods, such as Lenovo (old IBM) or other companies such as Haier. They insist that corporations serve China&#8217;s purposes. Whether China will encourage rampant American-style consumerism remains to be seen.</p>
<p>In short, on every front, American craftily engineered its own downfall&#8230;from foolish wars to economic policy. All for what? (Certainly not any interest in America.) Greed is the word that comes to mind. Privatization was to be the dream, private ownership of resources and production. Yet, now we see the rise of powerful Soverign Wealth Funds ready to buy or invest in American corporations and financial institutions. What America has created will be on the auction block. For sale will be its managerial expertise, its production and investment facilities, its R&#038;D&#8230;anything movable and much that is not movable.</p>
<p>If Nouriel is correct, those creations will move to new owners, owners that do not share America&#8217;s vision of the individual or its sense of democracy. In that sense, America has seeded the world. What flowers may bloom, we do not know.</p>

<p>SOCIAL SECURITY: Unpacking the Lies</p>
<p>Social Security is not difficult to explain. The difficulty comes because EVERYONE has been hearing stories about Social Security that are not true. And they have been hearing them their whole lives, so they believe them in their bones. They do not know that these stories are constructed by highly paid &#8220;experts,&#8221; or that these &#8220;non partisan experts&#8221; are paid by people who have a lot of money to spend on trying to destroy Social Security. We are asked to believe that these money people are only disinterested patriots, spending their own money to warn foolish Americans and their irresponsible Congressmen who are about to drive the country over a cliff of debt into financial and moral ruin. Future generations, we are told, the very babies, will be crushed by a staggering burden of debt, all possibility of a free life snuffed out before it even begins. And all because of &#8220;entitlements.&#8221;</p>
<p>I will show that this is not true. Moreover it cannot ever be true. It is not possible for it to be true.</p>
<p>The facts are clear enough, and few enough. You can verify them yourself. The problem will be getting you to pay attention to them and gradually letting go of what you think you already know. This will not be easy. Please don&#8217;t trust me. But don&#8217;t trust what you think you know already either.</p>
<p>This first essay will be very rough. The arithmetic won&#8217;t be quite right&#8230; we&#8217;ll get to that later. I just want to begin with the basic lie and show a way of thinking about it that should lead you to question it. We&#8217;ll get to the careful arithmetic next time. And there will be lots of repetition. Sorry about that. But the bad guys have been repeating their lies for twenty to seventy years, and it will take some repetition before reality sinks in.</p>
<p>The <strong>first</strong> thing to understand is that Social Security is NOT WELFARE. It is not &#8220;the rich&#8221; being taxed to provide for &#8220;the poor.&#8221; In fact it was created exactly to avoid welfare taxes and the indignity of working people having to rely on welfare. Social Security is an insurance program for workers, paid for by workers.</p>
<p>It IS mandatory because experience has shown that left to their own devices most people will not save enough for their own retirements. Social Security requires them to save enough, and in return it protects their money from inflation and provides other kinds of insurance that even the smartest people sometimes need. But it is insurance. Not welfare. Social Security requires workers to save enough, and this saves them from having to rely on welfare, and it saves the prudent from having to pay a welfare tax.</p>
<p>The <strong>second </strong>thing to understand is that Social Security is &#8220;off budget.&#8221; This means that Social Security can NEVER be the cause of a budget deficit. Any projected shortfall in Social Security is a problem for workers to solve by adjusting between the tax they pay (the insurance premium) and the level of benefits they expect to need in retirement.</p>
<p>The <strong>third</strong> thing you need to understand is that the projected deficit you hear about is not large. Though the paid liars have been screaming about &#8220;44 Trillion Dollar Unfunded Deficits&#8221;&#8230; and lately David Walker has upped the ante to 58 Trillion&#8230; these numbers are made up for the sole purpose of panicking you so you will sit quiet and stunned while they gut Social Security and take away your chances of being able to retire while you are still healthy enough to enjoy it.</p>
<p>The 44 Trillion dollar figure has a basis that is too complicated for us to get into here, but there is a way we can start to think about it. Divide the 44 Trillion by the 200 million taxpayers who will pay it, and then by the 75 years over which it will be paid: 44,000,000,000,000 / 200,000,000 / 75 = 2933 per year per taxpayer or about 56 dollars per week.</p>
<p>Then you need to know that this is not money going into some government black hole. This is the money that goes to YOU in the form of a monthly check of about 1600 dollars per month for the six years longer life expectancy you will have compared to the people the last time the premium (tax rate) was set. This will also pay for all of your medical care after you leave work. (Check: 2933 times the 40 years you will be paying it works out to 117,320 dollars. Divide that by the six years of extra life expectancy = 19,553 dollars per year or $1629 per month. Note these are real dollars, and we will get to where the interest went in a future post.)</p>
<p>Then you need to know that your income in this future time will have increased on average to about twice what you are now making. This is real income, not inflation. So if you are making the average wage of about 700 dollars per week now, you pay about 50 dollars per week in payroll taxes and your boss matches that. If the tax rate stays the same, in about 50 years you will be making about 1400 dollars per week and paying about 100 dollars per week in payroll taxes, with your boss matching that. But if you are going to be living longer, and paying more for medical care, you will need to pay an extra 28 dollars per week (your half of that extra $56).</p>
<p>So as a first approximation, &#8220;44 Trillion Dollar Unfunded Deficit&#8221; means that in about 50 years you will have twice as much money in your pocket left after paying a payroll tax that guarantees you a longer, richer retirement with your medical bills paid in advance: Today&#8217;s 700 &#8211; 50 = 650. Tomorrow&#8217;s 1400 &#8211; (100 +28) = 1272.</p>
<p>This does not look like a crisis or a huge burden to me. It looks like what being richer means. But let me remind you&#8230; this was all rough estimates. I will try to get back in a week with some more accurate numbers taken from the 2007 Trustees Report. They will be remarkably close to our estimate today. You may want to get ahead of me. Or show me where the 2008 Report changes anything significant.</p>

                                                                    </div>

                                <p>The Pravda on the Potomac lets Amity Schlaes print more GOP propaganda in her <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/17/AR2008081702079.html">Five Ways to Wreck the Economy</a>.  Charge one is that Democrats want to bring back Smoot-Hawley trade protectionism.  Not only is this charge false, it also assumes the trade protectionism lowers aggregate demand.  No – trade protection by itself would tend to raise net exports.  Then again – the concern might be what Schlaes describes here:</p>
<blockquote><p>An irate Canada and many other nations retaliated. At a time when the United States was begging for foreign markets, it lost them.</p></blockquote>
<p>But let’s move on.  Schlaes actually claims that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act has induced what would have been investment in the US economy to occur abroad as she argued this about the creation of the SEC in 1934:</p>
<blockquote><p>By 1934, Congress was creating the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Roosevelt administration also prosecuted business leaders, including former Treasury secretary Andrew Mellon and utilities magnate Samuel Insull. The new regulatory culture cut crime and protected investors. But the arbitrary nature of the assault petrified Wall Streeters.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess she is not aware that investment demand rose dramatically during FDR’s first term in office.  Then there is the fiscal responsibility leads to recessions canard:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, Democrats are planning tax increases that make Bill Clinton&#8217;s hike look mild. The proposals start with lifting the cap on Social Security payroll taxes &#8212; an effective increase in the top marginal tax rate of 6.2 percent, or for some 12.4 percent, all by itself. Add in the promised repeal of the Bush tax cuts and you have an additional 4.6 percent increase. Effective top rates approach 50 percent. There are also proposed increases for dividends and capital gains. Taken together, these will make the U.S. economy sluggish and more like that of Europe.</p></blockquote>
<p>I have two problems with this.  One is that real GDP growth averaged 3.7 percent during the Clinton years.  For the second problem, let’s give the microphone to <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=08&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=does_the_washington_post_corpo">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>While much of the column is just random ranting against Democratic policies, the column does include the assertion that the Democrats want to eliminate the cap on the Social Security payroll tax, &#8220;an effective increase in the top marginal tax rate of 6.2 percent, or for some 12.4 percent, all by itself.&#8221; The problem with this charge is that no one of any prominence in the Democratic party is proposing removing the cap on the payroll tax.  Senator Obama has called for imposing a tax of 2-4 percent on income over $250,000. This would affect only about one-fifth as many people as would be affected by removing the cap on the tax and the maximum impact would be less than one-third as large as Ms. Shlaes suggests. Columnists are supposed to have considerable leeway in expressing their views, but they should not be allowed to attribute positions to their opponents which they do not hold.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amy – I think Dean suggested that you lied on this one.  Charge four was:</p>
<blockquote><p>Assuming bigger government will bring back growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>More complaining about FDR but nothing about how a President Obama would make the size of government much larger.  Then there’s her catch-all category:</p>
<blockquote><p>FDR spoke of &#8220;bold persistent experimentation.&#8221; Obama speaks of &#8220;change.&#8221; Both can do damage.</p></blockquote>
<p>That’s right boys and girls – when Republicans talk, oil prices plummet.  When Democrats talk, the economy falls to hell.  We know Amity Shlaes loves to rail at how FDR caused the Great Depression – but this diatribe has nothing to do with the 2008 election.</p>

                                <p>Meeting <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/ieo/index.html">projected (latent) demands</a> for oil and other liquid hydrocarbon fuels over the next couple of decades — taking global production and consumption to the vicinity of 113 million barrels/day in 2030, from the current ~85-86 million b/d — will require bringing online the equivalent of a new Persian Gulf&#8217;s worth of new oil production, plus whatever it takes to replace the output from declining fields.  The periodic political fantasy of making the U.S. self-sufficient at roughly current consumption levels would take &#8220;only&#8221; something on the order of a Saudi Arabia&#8217;s worth of purely domestic production.</p>
<p>If you find that daunting, then you&#8217;re not in the part of the conservative commentariat that&#8217;s out there saying that those Saudi Arabias could be us were we only to exploit some hitherto off-limits and/or uneconomical sources with the gusto of the &#8216;drill here and drill now&#8217; set.</p>
<p>Last week, reader <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/editorial-on-oil-by-ibd-and-sammy.html">sammy pointed us</a> to a couple of op-eds from the Investor&#8217;s Business Daily, one on <a href="http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=301792181153291">prospective fossil fuel supplies in the Arctic</a>, and another on <a href="http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=301619245469105">shale oil</a>.  Even In Liberal Madison, we have right-wing gadflies and one of them, Rick Berg, <a href="http://www.isthmus.com/isthmus/article.php?article=23417">sounds similar notes</a> in our alt-weekly.  The argument, in a nutshell, is that shale oil and new (mostly) offshore fields can provide ample oil for the foreseeable future if only access to it were unfettered.  The implication, courtesy of <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article_print/SB121807001342018983.html">Daniel Henninger in the W$J</a>, is that we shouldn&#8217;t overreact and abandon our carbon economy which &#8220;run[s] like a Swiss watch (transportation, distribution, production, commuting)&#8221; for the uncertainty of low-carbon energy sources.  No less of a light than <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2008/aug/07/drill-drill-drill-is-working/">Larry Kudlow</a> says that the mere threat of new U.S. drilling has been working its magic on the oil markets, so maybe that panic-dumping of SUVs on the used-car market was hasty.  And last Friday&#8217;s Weekend Journal had <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121876246212743045.html?mod=taste_primary_hs">Todd Buchholz</a> damning the hippies and their stupid Priuses whose fuel-saving features pay for themselves in much less than the life of the car, double-underscored by <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121876314203443039.html?mod=taste_primary_hs">Stephen Moore</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s enough to make a suspicious liberal think there&#8217;s an organized campaign on to try to save the status quo, and some people may even be falling for it.    But should they?  Perhaps needless to say (you didn&#8217;t think this was going to be a &#8220;credit where due&#8221; post to Kudlow?), there are big problems with the pitch. Warning: Long post after the jump.</p>
<p>1. Resources versus reserves</p>
<p>Accounts of extravagantly large unconventional oil amounts elide critical distinctions between measures of oil-in-the-ground and recoverable oil-in the ground.  Both the IBD editorials and Berg&#8217;s op-ed cite the hundreds of billions or even trillions of barrels of oil in shale formations.  IBD:<br />
<blockquote>The quantity of oil to be found in this shale is almost unfathomable. The government conservatively puts it at 800 billion barrels. Other estimates say we have as much as 2 trillion barrels, though some of that wouldn&#8217;t be recoverable.</p></blockquote>
<p>Berg:<br />
<blockquote>Experts say the &#8220;Balkan Formation&#8221; [sic; he means &#8220;Bakken&#8221;] two miles below western North Dakota could yield between 270 and 500 <i>billion</i> barrels of crude oil. The famed North Slope of Alaska that Congress and President Clinton put off-limits in the 1990s has, by comparison, about 60 billion barrels of crude.</p></blockquote>
<p>The large figures for oil shale both IBD and Berg refer to are estimates of the &#8220;resources&#8221; as opposed to &#8220;reserves&#8221; that actually can be produced using current technology.   Particularly in the case of oil shale, the latter can be much smaller than the former depending on the formations&#8217; geologies.  The Bakken Shale is a case in point.  The <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1911">current USGS estimate</a> of technically recoverable undiscovered oil from the Bakken formation has a range of 3 to 4.3 billion barrels; the state of North Dakota&#8217;s estimate is 2.1 billion recoverable barrels from a resource of 167 billion barrels.   These are enormous increases from previous estimates, but aren&#8217;t going to make North Dakota the Saudi Arabia of the Plains.  The existence of large oil shale resources isn&#8217;t news to the oil market, either.  They&#8217;ve been known to be a large resource for the better part of the <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33359.pdf">last century</a>, and the last oil crisis brought about an oil shale boom and subsequent bust.</p>
<p>Likewise, IBD treats the recent estimate of recoverable oil and natural gas in the Arctic as if it were a sure thing as opposed to the result of a statistical analysis.  Are they as deferential to the scientific consensus on anthropogenic global warming?  Shockingly, <a href="http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=302139006837027">they are not</a>.  The oil is treated as all but in the gas tank:<br />
<blockquote>So by putting our Arctic resources into play, we would more than double our reserves overnight.
<p>What&#8217;s more, there could be more oil up there — much more — according to Donald Gautier, who wrote the report.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>This again puts the lie to the &#8220;peak&#8221; oil theorists, who have asserted repeatedly that the amount of oil we can use is in terminal decline and that it&#8217;s therefore futile to drill for more. It&#8217;s not.</p></blockquote>
<p>The 90 billion barrel figure is a mean, so the true amount could be less, of course.  The issue is not that the estimate is implausible, but rather that it&#8217;s an estimate that doesn&#8217;t even say &#8220;drill here.&#8221;  Determining how much oil and gas the Arctic actually could supply (and where exactly it is) is a matter for future exploration, assuming it&#8217;s feasible to carry out.  Feasibility of Arctic oil production is not a trivial matter, as an important caveat for USGS&#8217;s analysis (not mentioned by IBD) makes clear:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the purposes of this study, the USGS did not consider economic factors such as the effects of permanent sea ice or oceanic water depth in its assessment of undiscovered oil and gas resources.</p></blockquote>
<p>Neither factor is trivial when, according to the USGS study, 84% of the estimated resources would be found offshore.  K Harris in comments has another <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/8884996648592627091/#713502">telling quote and gloss</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Here, from a press piece reviewing the same data and also [quoting] Gautier&#8230; from Oppenheimer&#8217;s oil analysts. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have to go to the [Arctic] for new supply. Right now in the U. S. there are billions, trillions of cubic feet of natural gas and billions of barrels of oil.&#8221; The point to the quote is that while the data are getting more accurate, there is not really much surprise among experts at the amount of oil being found. They [k]new it was there, but also knew it was mostly not economical to extract. The Oppenheimer guy is pointing out that, at prices which make much of our Arctic reserves exploitable, it is now affordable to exploit resources in the lower 48.</p></blockquote>
<p>An amusing irony is that if global warming were to turn out to be a myth after all, the resurgent Arctic sea ice would make the resource especially difficult to recover, whereas circumstances that made offshore Arctic oil not much more difficult than any other offshore oil production in extremely remote places would not inconceivably be associated with carbon prices that discouraged the production.</p>
<p>2. From reserves and resources to production</p>
<p>Another big part of the oil-price picture is the rate of (sustainable) production, as commenters noted in the previous thread. On this front, the IBD Arctic oil editorial just assumes a production rate:<br />
<blockquote>Using a conservative estimate, let&#8217;s say we pump 3 million barrels a day after developing these Arctic resources. That would boost total U.S. crude output of 8 million barrels a day [sic — the ~8 million b/d figure includes crude oil and natural gas liquids] by 38%.</p></blockquote>
<p>The IBD editorial doesn&#8217;t say whose &#8220;conservative estimate&#8221; that might be, but I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it weren&#8217;t the editorial writer supposing that if we have 30 billion barrels of new oil reserves in Arctic Alaska and can make 5.2 million b/d out of the current 21 billion barrel reserves, then 3 million b/d must be &#8220;conservative.&#8221;  The Great Gazoogle might have told them that the <a href="http://www.alyeska-pipe.com/Pipelinefacts/PipelineOperations.html">Trans-Alaska Pipeline&#8217;s capacity</a> is 2.1 million barrels/day, which is an effective ceiling on near-term production from the Alaskan Arctic.  (This isn&#8217;t a binding near-term constraint, though, as production from the existing fields that feed the pipeline is 20 years past peak and declining; a looming issue is meeting the pipeline&#8217;s minimum flow rate.)  Natural gas resources in the Alaskan Arctic are stranded until a separate gas pipeline is built.  The need for substantial oil and gas infrastructure development on top of exploration means that the new resources can not be made productive in the near term.</p>
<p>The EIA&#8217;s Annual Energy Outlook forecasts unconventional liquids production (including production from oil shales) to gradually ramp up to approximately 2 million b/d in 2030 in its baseline scenario, and 3 million b/d in the &#8220;high price&#8221; scenario.  However, it&#8217;s inappropriate to add that production, or hypothetical future Arctic or OCS production, to the current U.S. liquids output, since some of it would offset declines in production from conventional sources — about 1 million b/d in the baseline, less in &#8220;high price&#8221; where the projected U.S. conventional production peak is later.</p>
<p>Moreover, oil shale roduction rates may be economically limited by the energy and water intensity of the production processes.   Commenter Michael Cain <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/8884996648592627091/#713579">recounted</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A couple of years ago, I had the opportunity to listen to Shell engineers talk about their in situ process at the Colorado School of Mines. One of the interesting back-of-the-envelope points that came out was that producing a million bbl/day using the process would require an amount of electricity just about equal to the current generating capacity in Colorado. Building that much generating capacity in that part of the country is problematic at best: water for cooling is in short supply; and the most readily available fuel is coal.</p></blockquote>
<p>You can do the back-of-the-envelope <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/kids/energyfacts/science/energy_calculator.html">calculation</a> yourself.  There&#8217;s about 5.8 million BTU, or 1,700 kWh, in a barrel of oil.  So if you want to make a million barrels of oil at an EROEI of 4:1, then energy input is the equivalent of 250,000 barrels.  The equivalent in electricity is 424,750 MWh, which requires 17.7 GW of &#8217;round-the-clock generation capacity to produce in 24 hours.  That is, indeed, more than the nameplate capacity of all of the electric generating units in Colorado as of 2005 (<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/page/capacity/existingunits2005.xls">xls</a>).  I assume electricity isn&#8217;t the process&#8217;s only energy input, but Cain&#8217;s story does accurately report the order of magnitude of the energy-input problem for low-EROEI unconventional resources.  EIA forecasts note that the carbon-intensity of oil shale and coal-to-liquids among other unconventional sources makes their prospects particularly sensitive to potential carbon emissions regulation.</p>
<p>In a sign that oil companies respond to the price mechanism, current drilling for oil (in locations where it&#8217;s currently allowed) actually has increased markedly from its cheap-oil trough, as measured by the number of <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/e_ertrro_xr0_nus_cm.htm">crude oil rotary drilling rigs in operation</a>. This is the drilling that can plausibly add to near-term domestic supplies.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/dnav/pet/hist/mcrfpus2m.htm">effect</a> of this so far has been to stabilize if not slightly increase domestic crude oil production, which otherwise has been in a long decline.  (In a sign that the Bush Administration was too lazy or distracted to convert its own domestic-drilling policies into reality, the rig counts bounced along at their trough into the second term; U.S. crude oil production [<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/ipsr/t11c.xls">xls</a>] remains a few hundred thousand b/d lower than when our oilmen-in-chief took office.) Drilling rig utilization rates are also very high, so that&#8217;s another near-term supply constraint.</p>
<p>3. More supply lowers prices, other things equal, but relative to what?</p>
<p>The reality-based view of expanded drilling is that it will have relatively small and distant effects on oil prices, simply reflecting that unexplored resources can&#8217;t be turned into reserves and then into large-scale production overnight.  Particularly in evaluating stay-the-carbon-course commentary from the likes of Henninger, it&#8217;s worth considering the baseline scenarios against which the modest long-term effects of additional drilling would accrue.  This brings us back to the long-range forecasts mentioned at the top of the post.</p>
<p>The EIA&#8217;s baseline scenario from its <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/index.html">2008 Annual Energy Outlook</a> — published in June, but reporting analysis clearly developed much earlier — figures on an oil supply of 113.3 million b/d in 2030 at a light crude oil price of $70.45 in 2006 dollars. As an exercise, inflate that to 2030 dollars; e.g., if the Fed managed to produce 2% CPI inflation between now and then, that means that the nominal price of oil in 2030 would be approximately the same as it is now.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dAYXCP-wxFE/SKiNI_XgvHI/AAAAAAAAABU/Xrl4HgoqH2I/s1600-h/Picture+3.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dAYXCP-wxFE/SKiNI_XgvHI/AAAAAAAAABU/Xrl4HgoqH2I/s400/Picture+3.png" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Since actual production for the year-to-date has averaged 85.5 million barrels, someone has to come up with 27.8 million b/d of net new production.  Again, that&#8217;s a little more than a Persian Gulf&#8217;s worth of production, which currently is 24-25 million b/d.  The AEO&#8217;s <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/aeo/aeohighprice.html">&#8220;high price&#8221; scenario</a> (which has looked optimistically low for much of the year-to-date) makes for less of a production challenge, but still calls for 97.7 million b/d of 2030 production, now with a light-crude price of $118.65/bbl in 2006 dollars. That inflates to the better part of $200 in nominal terms with low inflation.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dAYXCP-wxFE/SKiNW7-MlNI/AAAAAAAAABc/66-nNsOI7IM/s1600-h/Picture+4.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dAYXCP-wxFE/SKiNW7-MlNI/AAAAAAAAABc/66-nNsOI7IM/s400/Picture+4.png" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Drilling advocates may well look at this and say &#8216;let&#8217;s get cracking.&#8217;  However, all the sources that Republicans have been eager to drill put together are no more than a small downpayment on the production needed to bring back real prices to levels of the AEO reference scenario that, don&#8217;t forget, were still incipient Armageddon for SUVs, big rigs, and airlines among other notable elements of the oil economy.  What passes for the political discourse hasn&#8217;t been going out of its way to point out that what we might be buying via the drilling route is $9.95 gas instead of $10 the next time oil supplies prove to be a couple million b/d short.  Meanwhile, lots of money will have been made and run off with, and the oil that might be more valuable to future generations in the ground can&#8217;t be unburnt.</p>
<p>Barry Ritholtz recently <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2008/08/chart-of-the-da.html">posted a picture that&#8217;s worth quite a few words</a> on the recent paths of world output — a proxy for latent demand growth — and oil production.  When, as has happened, supply plateaus and latent demand grows onward, prices need to rise to &#8216;destroy&#8217; enough latent demand to equilibrate actual demand and supply.  So what have we seen recently?  In part, oil production stagnated since rising to its current plateau:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dAYXCP-wxFE/SKiQQ4JIsjI/AAAAAAAAABk/5ks4jMhnLME/s1600-h/Picture+2.png"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_dAYXCP-wxFE/SKiQQ4JIsjI/AAAAAAAAABk/5ks4jMhnLME/s400/Picture+2.png" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>This would be no big deal in the face of a cyclical downturn, but this was not the case in &#8217;05 (much as we might find fault with the expansion out of the 2001 recession).  Having price-inelastic demands and supplies is a recipe for price volatility, and in this case there was a fair amount of demand to shed.  The last Annual Energy Outlook figured on 2008 oil supply of 87.23 million b/d with a light crude price of $83.59 in 2006 dollars, or around $91 in current dollars.  For the first five months of the year, <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/ipm/supply.html">oil supplies</a> actually have been 85.5 million b/d [yet another <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/ipsr/t14.xls">.xls</a>].  <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/07/oil_prices_and.html">Prof. Hamilton</a> has been telling the rest of the story.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a lot of demand destruction with $4 gas, plus the business cycle isn&#8217;t what it used to be, so there&#8217;s no reason why we couldn&#8217;t see $91 oil or lower in the near term.  In that regard, I wouldn&#8217;t necessarily bet against sammy on near-term price increases.</p>
<p>But keeping on the EIA&#8217;s &#8220;high price&#8221; path involves keeping world oil production growth at 0.6% per year and of course holding world oil demand growth to 0.6% per year while (we hope) general economic growth is rather more robust.  Even the more generous baseline from the Annual Energy Outlook involves reducing global demand growth 0.3% per year as compared to the last twenty years&#8217; average while coming up, as we&#8217;ve seen, with vast new supplies.  Can this happen?  Sure it can, but knocking out decent chunks of demand growth over long periods of time and refusing to restructure the the more oil-intensive economies risks trouble.  If 0.6% supply growth were to prove optimistic over the longer haul, then we&#8217;re likely to find that we wanted the economic restructuring Henninger considers &#8220;risky&#8221; yesterday.</p>

<blockquote><p>McCain hails from an America that exalted service to country, and he is the scion of a military family who endured five years in enemy captivity and who preaches a mantra of personal honor and of the nation over the individual &#8212; &#8220;Country First,&#8221; as his campaign slogan declares. His wife is conspicuously reserved at his side; he does not communicate by e-mail and only recently learned to use the Internet; even his roguish sense of humor carries echoes of the more chauvinistic 1950s of his youth. Obama&#8217;s embodiment of a newer America begins but hardly ends with the fact that he would be the first black president. In a country where people liked to know where you were from, Obama lacks a ready answer &#8212; he is part Hawaii, part Kansas, part Chicago. In a recent speech in Berlin, he declared himself a &#8220;citizen of the world.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Oliver?</p>
<blockquote><p>Because clearly John McCain’s family is so different from the rest of us in their belief in honor and patriotism. I mean, the rest of us unwashed masses couldn’t dare to hold a candle to their belief, right? &#8230; OMG BARACK OBAMA’S FAMILY MOVED. Clearly this disqualifies him as a True AmericanTM. Of course, I’ve moved around a lot too (I even lived in a foreign country!) so I might as well be an alien.</p></blockquote>
<p>WaPo’s Alec MacGillis starts his propaganda for McCain by quoting some 65 year old man suggesting young people are lazy and disrespectful, which is why they are working so hard to elect Obama as President – guess.  MacGillis then tosses in:</p>
<blockquote><p>Obama has tried to compensate by proposing a tax cut for seniors, which was criticized by economists.</p></blockquote>
<p>John McCain would NEVER promise fiscally irresponsible tax cuts to get a vote.  PLEASE!  If this is a generational gap matter – then why are those close to the age of retirement supposed to vote for the fellow who’d slash their Social Security benefits?  Oh wait – those kind of questions can’t be asked at the Pravda on the Potomac.</p>

<p>I want to stress that last point because there is no denying it: the system failed. The active wrong-doing detailed in the two joint reports was not systemic in that only a few people were directly implicated in it. But the failure was systemic in that the system–the institution–failed to check the behavior of those who did wrong. There was a failure of supervision by senior officials in the Department. And there was a failure on the part of some employees to cry foul when they were aware, or should have been aware, of problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>I propose that any testimony in Congress, statement to the press, or a document that is 55% passive voice or more by scanning simply be discarded, the testifying or reporting offender then asked to return at a later date using active voice in at least the written statements. Maybe shushed in the oral statement. Same for the questioner who allows it.</p>
<p>Update:  Reader Jill points out it is not passive voice. Okay.  However, Mukasey&#8217;s language is passive: things evidently just happened. Jill is more accurate.</p>

                                <p>Before we get to carried away about the impact of the weak dollar  on  US  trade, and especially exports I suggest we look at some recent history.  See the previous post. This chart has the dollar inverted, so remember the dollar was strong in the 1990s and weak since 2000.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKce0JuhoXI/AAAAAAAAAXE/4e53HpeeoEw/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKce0JuhoXI/AAAAAAAAAXE/4e53HpeeoEw/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>What this shows is that real US exports grew at about the same rate in the 1990s period of a strong dollar as they grew in the weak dollar era of recent years.  The only period of weak exports was during the world economic slowdown at the turn of the century.</p>
<p>When you look at the import side of the story the story appears similar. However, real import growth has been weaker in recent years than it was in the 1990s.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKclBtpmJ_I/AAAAAAAAAXU/pT5m0gMjYoU/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKclBtpmJ_I/AAAAAAAAAXU/pT5m0gMjYoU/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;m posting these charts  because I suspect that the dollar plays a decidedly secondary role to relative growth in determining US real exports and imports.  I have not tried to  quantify or test this feeling,  but it makes me reluctant to get too excited about the impact of currency changes on trade.  For example, in the 1990s real domestic demand growth averaged around 4% as compared to around 3%  in the 2000s.  Moreover, in the 1990s growth accelerated as the decade progressed  while in recent years it has slowed.  This is enough to account for a significant share of the slower import growth in the 2000s.</p>
<p>Moreover, in the 1990s economist were surprised by how small the impact of currency changes turned out to be.  A major body of academic research found many reasons why firms have learned to get around the impact of currency changes.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just warning to not expect too much from currency changes.  you are liable to be disappointed.</p>
<p>Maybe we need to get a good econometrician like Menzie Chin at Econobrowser to comment on this.</p>
<p>Note the last months observations have not been updated in these charts.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121884105817145699.html?mod=hpp_us_whats_news">This WSJ article</a> started nicely:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. dollar marched higher again on Friday, continuing a development that could ease inflationary pressures but also could slow a U.S. export boom.</p></blockquote>
<p>The implications of reduced export demand, however, we left for <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=08&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=a_higher_raises_fears_of_sharp">Dean Baker</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The over-valuation of the dollar has been of the economy&#8217;s most serious problems for the last decade. The high dollar led to an unsustainable trade deficit that peaked at almost 6 percent of GDP in 2006. By definition, a trade deficit means that domestic savings is less than domestic investment. This means that (barring an investment boom, which we have not seen) there must be either a large government deficit, low private savings, or a combination of the two. None of these situations are desirable or sustainable, at least over the long-term. While the trade deficit has consistently been far larger than the budget deficit over the last decade, it has received far less attention from the media. The only plausible way to bring the size of the deficit down to a manageable level is buy reducing the value of the dollar. A lower dollar is especially important in the wake of the collapse of the housing bubble. Without the improvement in the trade balance, the economy would have been shrinking over the last three quarters. Without a continued improvement in the trade balance, spurred by a falling dollar, there is little hope that the U.S. economy will escape a prolonged downturn. The media should be giving more attention to the recent rise in the dollar and pointing out the danger it poses to the economy. It should also be discussing the dollar in the context of the presidential campaign, since the next president&#8217;s policy on the value of the dollar is likely to have more impact on the near-term health of the economy than anything else he does in office.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have noted that Lawrence Kudlow wants a stronger dollar.  Fortunately, this National Review nitwit is not running for President.  John McCain is and he also wants a stronger dollar.  Someone should ask John McCain why he would endorse a policy that would reduce exports and increase imports.</p>
