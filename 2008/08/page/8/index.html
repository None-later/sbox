<p>Together with a co-author, I&#8217;ve been working on a book looking at how a number of series &#8211; everything from economic growth to abortion rates &#8211; have evolved over the length of each administration beginning with Ike. The process is starting to move, we&#8217;ve gotten ourselves an agent, and we hope to have a book deal soon. (I have no idea how long this process takes.)</p>
<p>Its been interesting, and I&#8217;ve learned a lot. Perhaps the biggest thing I&#8217;ve learned is that you have to rewrite and rewrite and rewrite, and you have to keep looking for ways to present the same material. One thing I&#8217;m particularly interested in (and long-time readers may recall this from when I was regularly writing posts here at Angry Bear) is the issue of taxation and how it affects other things like growth or tax revenues. For example, that was covered <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Naturally, that&#8217;s a topic I couldn&#8217;t avoid in the book. But many folks here at Angry Bear (Divorced One Like Bush and Dan especially, but many more) kept telling me I had to have simpler and clearer ways to get the information across. I think I&#8217;m getting there. So I&#8217;d like to share two graphs from the manuscript.</p>
<p>The first one looks at annualized changes in the actual tax rates and the annualized changes in the growth or real GDP per capita. Yes, actual tax rates. None of that silly marginal tax rate nonsense. My first job was at a Big Accounting Firm, and if there&#8217;s one thing I learned, its that nobody who can afford Big Accounting Firm hourly fees pays anything resembling marginal rates. I also learned that enforcement makes one heck of a difference. Fortunately, right on the internet, the IRS provides data on the actual amount we all pay in taxes as a share of personal income. That&#8217;s the actual rate. The rest is theoretical fluff.</p>
<p>Another thing, before I put up the graph &#8211; the annualized changes are calculated from the last full year before each administration took office until their last full year in office. Thus, we get to see how much each President increased or decreased a series from what it was when their predecessor was in charge.</p>
<p>(To save time &#8211; I know the same arguments that have been dispensed with twelve times are going to come up &#8211; let me refer any critiques <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/by-cactus-and-before-anything-else-lets.html">here</a>, where many of the usual objections are dealt with.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s graph 1:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SKqxYdfXWEI/AAAAAAAAASA/PN27HMLyOog/s1600-h/taxratesvgrowthrates.bmp"><img alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SKqxYdfXWEI/AAAAAAAAASA/PN27HMLyOog/s400/taxratesvgrowthrates.bmp" border="0"></a><br />The usual Republican talking point is that cutting taxes produces faster economic growth. If you see it in the chart, let me know. And if you insist on giving Reagan credit for the growth rates from 1992 to 2000, be sure to give him credit for the growth rates from 1988 to 1992 as well.</p>
<p>The second graph looks at annualized changes in the actual tax rates and the annualized changes in real taxes paid rate per capita. Here, the idea is that cutting people&#8217;s taxes could lead people to pay more taxes. The Laffer curve and all of that. And yes, I know these days some on the Republican side will tell you &#8220;nobody really believes that.&#8221; I would suggest they ask Mr. McCain whether he believes it and then get back to us.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SKq0wpi5PzI/AAAAAAAAASI/IAg1NZO3Aao/s1600-h/taxpercapita.BMP"><img alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_RPTAaOI4RN8/SKq0wpi5PzI/AAAAAAAAASI/IAg1NZO3Aao/s400/taxpercapita.BMP" border="0"></a><br />Again, if what I&#8217;m supposed to see is in here, someone please point it out. But to be honest, I&#8217;m simply not seeing any way to reconcile Republican talking points on taxation with the real world.</p>
<p>A few final points:<br />Data for the actual tax rate is <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175814,00.html">here</a>.<br />Data for real gdp per capita and population is obtained from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/Index.asp">NIPA Table 7.1</a><br />Data for real tax collections comes from <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget/fy2009/sheets/hist01z3.xls">OMB Table 1.3</a>.<br />I&#8217;ve also downloaded all the data and links into this <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=p_ax_fywYILibmbhiJSMhBg">Google Spreadsheet</a>.<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;<br />by cactus</p>

                                <p>I have an interesting opportunity for you guys at Angry Bear!  First<br />off, thank you for your continued support of Facing Up to the Nation&#8217;s<br />Finances.  Now, however, I am writing about the presidential debates.<br />Please read the letter below and let me know if you&#8217;re interested:</p>
<p>Hello, my name is Billy Hallowell and I am the director of content<br />here at VoterWatch.  We are reaching out to you today to discuss &#8220;The<br />Presidential Debates Project&#8221; &#8212; an exciting new project that we&#8217;d<br />like to invite you to participate in.  &#8220;The Presidential Debates<br />Project&#8221; is intended to bring together traditional journalists,<br />bloggers and prominent minds from the left and right in an innovative<br />and informative manner.  Using our technology, these individuals will<br />blog within live video coverage of the four presidential/one<br />vice-presidential debates.</p>
<p>A major component of our work at VoterWatch&#8217;s is our innovative video<br />player technology.  This technology allows users to insert commentary<br />(fact checks, links, corroborative content, etc.) within video.  The<br />commentary then scrolls alongside the video.   The &#8220;Presidential<br />Debates Project&#8221; aggregates coverage that encompasses hard news and<br />opinion.  Each journalist would have his or her commentary presented<br />on the corresponding outlet&#8217;s web site or blog.  Then, we will air all<br />of the content on our web site, providing an intriguing record for the<br />public to view following each debate.  This project is the perfect<br />opportunity to air the event, while inserting commentary, hard news<br />and/or perspective for your visitors.</p>
<p>Update:First, thanks for posting this! Secondly, this is very different. Our tool is about an interactive presentation that in synced collectively to specific points within video. www.voterwatch.org<br />Billy Hallowell </p>
<p>The goal of our project is to bring together numerous perspectives on<br />American politics as well as non-partisan annotations in order to have<br />the electorate not only more informed, but also more motivated to<br />understand the realities behind what the candidates are saying.</p>
<p>I look forward to discussing your potential involvement in this project.<br />&#8212; <br />Sincerely,<br />Billy Hallowell<br />Director of Content, VoterWatch<br />www.voterwatch.org<br />&#8220;The Congressional Record You&#8217;ve Always Wanted&#8221;</p>

<blockquote><p>So here&#8217;s the part where I get confused. The only way to balance our current account is to stop importing more than we export. In other words, we need to reduce our net consumption of foreign goods and services, which almost certainly means an overall reduction in our consumption of goods and services too.  On the other hand, a credit-induced recession demands that we stimulate consumption. Otherwise we fall even deeper into recession.  So which is it? Increase consumption in order to keep our current recession from turning into a depression, or reduce consumption in order to avoid long-term disaster caused by a growing current-account deficit? Can we somehow do both with an export-driven boom? Is there another option I&#8217;m not taking seriously enough? Or are we just screwed?</p></blockquote>
<p>Jan Tinbergen’s <em>Economic Policy: Principles and Design</em> points out that if you have two policy problems – as in weak aggregate demand and a current account deficit – but only one policy tool (expenditure-adjusting policies such as those that impact domestic consumption), then one is indeed screwed.   But we do have <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/01/china-and-us-macroeconomic-policies.html">expenditure-switching</a> options.  I have long favored policies that would lead to dollar devaluation so we could generate even more of an export-driven boom even if John McCain and Lawrence Kudlow want a stronger dollar.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The traditional annual list of Party Schools now has a jump-start. In no particular order, except the way <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/HEALTH/08/18/college.drinking.age.ap/index.html">CNN listed them</a>:
<ol>Duke<br />Dartmouth<br />Ohio State<br />Syracuse<br />Tufts<br />Colgate<br />Kenyon<br />Morehouse<br />Middlebury College<br />Rhodes College</ol>
<p>The reasoning is such that Only the <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2008/08/i-was-so-pleased-to-be-informed-of-this.html">Current Attorney General</a> could love:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;This is a law that is routinely evaded,&#8221; said John McCardell, former president of Middlebury College in Vermont who started the organization. &#8220;It is a law that the people at whom it is directed believe is unjust and unfair and discriminatory.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Is routinely evaded&#8221; is College President-speak for &#8220;The system is broken, <strong>so</strong> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/passive-voice-makes-for-never-proven.html">I&#8217;m not responsible</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since this reasoning also applies to most recreational drug consumption, including but not limited to marijuana, crack, cocaine, and Ecstasy, I expect the Amethyst Initiative to move on to those areas next.</p>
<p>It falls to a former Clinton Administration official to tell the truth and shame the Devil,* in around the 16th or 17th graf:<br />
<blockquote> But some other college administrators sharply disagree that lowering the drinking age would help. University of Miami President Donna Shalala, who served as secretary of health and human services under President Clinton, declined to sign.</p>
<p>&#8220;I remember college campuses when we had 18-year-old drinking ages, and I honestly believe we&#8217;ve made some progress,&#8221; Shalala said in a telephone interview. &#8220;To just shift it back down to the high schools makes no sense at all.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And it is even later in the piece that they point out that the researcher whose work the Amethyst Initiative cites not only disagrees, but sees through the facade:<br />
<blockquote> McCardell cites the work of Alexander Wagenaar, a University of Florida epidemiologist and expert on how changes in the drinking age affect safety. But Wagenaar himself sides with MADD in the debate.</p>
<p>The college presidents &#8220;see a problem of drinking on college campuses, and they don&#8217;t want to deal with it,&#8221; Wagenaar said in a telephone interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s really unfortunate, but the science is very clear.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/08/things-are-progessing-swimmingly.html">Things are progessing swimmingly</a></p>
<p>For me, that is&#8230; in terms of my economical prognostication.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll beat my own drum yet again &#8211; I know you&#8217;re all sick of someone saying &#8220;I told you so&#8221; but I still can&#8217;t understand why high priced financial analysts can make a living out of getting it wrong while little old me has to sit here and remember that I first heard the word <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude">&#8220;Schadenfreude&#8221;</a> explained on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Flanders_Failed">The Simpsons</a>.</p>
<p>So, anyway. Here&#8217;s what I said back in <a href="http://one-salient-oversight.blogspot.com/2008/01/slow-demolition-of-us-economy.html">January 2008</a>:<br />What I am therefore predicting in 2008 is a period of painful stagflation for America &#8211; a combination of economic contraction and inflation which will only be solved when the Fed raises rates and plunges the economy into a double-dip recession.<br />And <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&#038;sid=amisOhrnjyh4&#038;refer=home">here&#8217;s the latest</a>:<br />U.S. consumer prices rose more than forecast in July, indicating Federal Reserve policy makers have reason to be concerned over a pickup in inflation.</p>
<p>The consumer price index climbed 0.8 percent, twice as much as anticipated, the Labor Department said today in Washington. The cost of living was up 5.6 percent in the year ended in July, the biggest jump in 17 years. So-called core prices, which exclude food and energy, also rose more than projected.</p>
<p>The report may intensify the debate between those Fed policy makers that forecast inflation will slow and those concerned that price pressures will accelerate. Increases beyond food and fuel, including gains in clothing, airline fares and education, make it less likely that central bankers will be able to keep interest rates unchanged for long.<br />According to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misery_index_%28economics%29">Misery Index</a>, inflation of 5.6% plus unemployment of 5.7% equals a misery rate of 11.3. The <a href="http://www.miseryindex.us/indexbymonth.asp">last time it was this high was in June 1991</a> when it hit 11.60. The highest in 17 years. The Misery Index is a hard and fast index that is useful at measuring stagflation (but is not without its faults).</p>
<p>So anyway, I&#8217;ll just continue to sit here laughing maniacally and feeling good about all the emotional and economic suffering in the US while millionaire financial analysts continue to get it wrong.</p>
<p>Update:<br />The latest inflation release can be downloaded directly <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf">here</a>. (pdf, 108.3kb)</p>

<p>
<blockquote>Is when Unemployment is 5% or more and when Inflation is 5% or more at the same time.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.miseryindex.us/raw_data.asp">raw data at the Misery Index site</a>, the US experienced my definition of stagflation during the following periods:</p>
<p>July 1970 &#8211; February 1971 (Unemployment average 5.6%, Inflation 5.52%, 8 months)</p>
<p>April 1973 (Un-5.0% and Inf-5.06%, 1 month)</p>
<p>January 1974 &#8211; October 1976 (Un-7.24% and Inf-8.88%, 34 months)</p>
<p>January 1977 &#8211; October 1982 (Un-7.14% and Inf-9.38%, 70 months)</p>
<p>April 1989 &#8211; June 1989 (Un-5.23% and Inf-5.22%, 3 months)</p>
<p>January 1990 &#8211; March 1990 (Un-5.3% and Inf-5.23%, 3 months)</p>
<p>August 1990 &#8211; February 1992 (Un-6.14% and Inf-5.92%, 19 months)</p>
<p>June 2008 &#8211; July 2008 (Un-5.6% and Inf-5.31%, 2 months so far)</p></blockquote>

<p>If the capability &#8220;gaps&#8221; were properly characterized, the whittle this week demonstrates that technical processes are not executed to deliver the capability to close the &#8220;gap&#8221;.</p>
<p>GAO again gives some findings to work from. <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08619.pdf">&#8220;A Knowledge Based Funding Approach Could Improve Major Weapon System Program Outcomes&#8221;</a>. July 2008.</p>
<p>The finding include: &#8220;For a majority of the weapon system programs GAO reviewed, costs have exceeded the funding levels initially planned for and reflected in the Future Years Defense Program (FYDP)—DOD’s investment strategy. To compensate for these shortfalls, DOD makes unplanned and inefficient funding adjustments, like moving money from one program to another, deferring costs into the future, or reducing procurement quantities.&#8221;</p>
<p>This sometimes happens because the programs are started without enough money is not in the 5 year budget. I have seen that more often than I care to remember, objective evaluations asked the questions but no one wanted to see or acknowledge that there was not enough money. Failed development occurs because of other issues as well.</p>
<p>A few lines later: &#8220;DOD’s flawed funding process is largely driven by decision makers’ willingness to accept unrealistic cost estimates and DOD’s commitment to more programs than it can support. DOD often underestimates development costs—due in part to a lack of knowledge and optimistic assumptions about requirements and critical technologies.&#8221;</p>
<p>The technical manager comes to the civilian decision makers; Service Acquisition Executives who are sponsoring their folks to get their share of the big bucks, and Defense Acquisition Executives equally motivated to waste the taxpayers scarce resources, with wildly understated cost estimates, supporting equally ,underfunded budgets to deliver ill suited performance specifications, to design something to fill the &#8220;gap&#8221;. The result will not deliver any combat capability to fill the &#8220;gap&#8221;. The program manager, making wild and often misleading statements, tells them his team can meet the &#8220;gap&#8221; just trust them.</p>
<p>In the end the decision makers do &#8220;trust&#8221; them. They go off and spend a lot of money and when they run out they come back for more money with nothing to show for the expenditure.</p>
<p>This is accomplished by no one questioning the program manager and criticizing their assumptions about the job and their ability to do the job. The estimates are wishful thinking and their budgets are inadequate. It is very much like ignoring the elephant in the room. The elephant is the lack of knowledge in the decision process that can be seen concerning the technology to be applied, whether it can close the capability gap, if it can be manufactured and if it could be integrated with other systems and the battle plan. All of those unasked concerns have consequences which make costs rise and take more time to do the work, if it is ever completed.</p>
<p>Management by wishful thinking and casting the dice rather than knowledge is the hallmark. The civilian decision makers are complicit rubes being taken by the program office con men.</p>
<p>GAO continues to see the &#8220;conspiracy of hope&#8221; described by the <a href="http://www.acq.osd.mil/dapaproject/documents/DAPA-Report-web/DAPA-Report-web-feb21.pdf">Defense Acquisition Performance Assessment</a> of Mar 2006: See Pg 46/157 </p>
<p>Might as well whittle beaks than send a group of defense complex elite out to try and fix their own mess.</p>
<p>I find this quote appropriate in the ongoing mess; the management of the US &#8220;regard inexcusable failures and errors with too tolerant an eye……” Ike Oct 1942 from An Army at Dawn pg. 60</p>
<p>Next week I shift from wishful thinking in budget reviews to wishful thinking in technical reviews! Warning could be Tanta style wonky.</p>

<p>Thanks to <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/added-commentary-on-questionable.html">rdan</a> and <a href="http://www.moonofalabama.org/2008/08/amity-shlaes-fo.html#more">Moon of Alabama</a> for realizing that the BEA provides certain macroeconomic data that would help follow-up on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/amity-shlaes-on-alleged-damage-to.html">my criticisms</a> of the latest garbage from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/17/AR2008081702079.html">Amy Schlaes</a>.  But let’s graph real GDP rather than nominal GDP – please.  Your qualitative statements still hold and if we also graph the components of aggregate demand (CON = consumption, INV = investment, GOV = government purchases, EX = exports, and IM = imports), we can really show what an uninformed rightwing dolt Ms. Schlaes happens to be.  </p>
<p>Yes – real GDP did quite well after FDR took office as did investment demand.  Now Ms. Schlaes does complain that the government got too big but wouldn’t most macroeconomists argue that the rise in government purchases lead to a rise in aggregate demand, which augmented the rise in domestic private spending (consumption and investment) as we recovered from the Great Depression?  I also find fascinating the behavior of exports and imports.  While it is true that exports fell from 1929 to 1932, imports fell even more.  So with net exports rising – Ms. Schlaes seems to be at a loss to explain how these trade balance effects lead to the Great Depression.</p>

                            <div class="category-title">
                                 
                                                                    </div>
                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Since others agreed in the prior post that the depression chart would be better in real dollars rather than nominal dollars I though I would take this opportunity to post this chart.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKnMuRZ9ZRI/AAAAAAAAAXc/yjg86C2WP2c/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKnMuRZ9ZRI/AAAAAAAAAXc/yjg86C2WP2c/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>In business cycle analysis if you use NBER official terminology the cyle should be divided into three phases.  The first is recession from the peak in economic activity to the bottom. The second is recovery from the bottom in economic activity until the  the previous peak  is reached.<br />The third phase is the expansion from when the prior peak is surpassed until the next peak.</p>
<p>The second part of this chart is a basic forecasting rule I developed years ago that recessions&#8211; recoveries are symmetrical.  That is the recovery period is almost always the same length as the recession.  If the economy falls for 4 quarters it should take it 4 quarters to regain the prior peak and on average that is what happened in post WW II recession. In other words, mild recessions have weak recoveries and deep recessions have strong recoveries.  You can see that in the dashed line in the chart above.  Also note that the dashed line is quarterly data while the solid line showing the 1930s is annual data.  The BEA only published annual data for the 1930s.</p>
<p>If you look at the 1929 to 1936 period it is obvious that this rule worked well.  The downturn was four years from 1929 to 1933 and the recovery was three years from  1933 to 1936 when real GDP surpassed the 1929 peak. According to the NBER the bottom was in March, 1933, the very month FDR took office. If we had quarterly data it would look even more like the 1929-36 recession&#8211;recovery was symmetrical ,just like the post WW II recession &#8212; recoveries.</p>
<p>We have a massive sub-industry in the economics profession claiming that the depression recovery was weak.  But this chart actually suggest that the 1933-36 recovery was very strong by post WW II standards because after falling for four years the economy only took three  years to surpass the 1929 peak.  In the chart I put the bottom in 1933 and in post WW II recession at the same point on the scale so the 1929 peak is placed earlier then the post-war peaks.  So this chart says that all the analysis blaming Roosevelt and the new deal for a weak recovery is just plain incorrect.  The recovery was not weak in comparison to other recoveries.</p>
<p>Where you get the difference is in 1937-38. In a normal economic cycle this would be the expansion when growth is normally above trend and  in the 1930s the economy clearly had the capacity to grow at 8%-9% rates in 1937-38 as it did in 1939 and 1940.</p>
<p>But in 1937-38 the US had a recession rather than growing at 8% to 9%.  this difference is why the good economists are correct in saying the recovery in the depression was weak.  Of course, this raises the question of why there was a recession in 1937-38 and that is open to debate.<br />I personally blame the Fed just as the Fed was the single most important reason for the 1929-33 collapse.  In late 1936 the Fed became very worried that the economy was too strong and would generate inflation.  So they raised reserve requirements, a tightening move that caused the 1937-38 recession just as such tightening moves generally cause recessions.  If this analysis is correct it implies that the analysis by Amy Shlaes and other blaming the New Deal are completely without any basis.</p>

<p>A. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoot-Hawley_Tariff_Act">Smoot Hawley Tariff Act</a>The first misstep according to Shlaes was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act which increased tariffs on imports to the U.S. by up to 50%. It was put into law in June 1930 by the Republican congress under Hoover. That would be at point A on the GDP chart. Smoot-Hawley was indeed bad. </p>
<p>B. Democrats took over Congress in November 1932 and in early 1933 appointed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecora_Commission">Ferdinand Pecora</a> as commission counselor. Pecora found many malpractices on Wall Street and his investigation led to the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We can put these events at point B of the GDP chart</p>
<p>C. Hoover&#8217;s tax decrease in 1929/30 was followed by four years of decreasing GDP. His &#8220;misstep&#8221; tax increase was enacted in 1932 and took effect only in 1933, point C in our graph. From there on GDP went up.</p>
<p>D. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_deal">New Deal</a> beginnings.</p>
<p>Shlaes, according to her Wikipedia entry &#8220;has no formal economic training.&#8221; That certainly shows. She also seems to have zero training in history as she is unable to organize the sequence of events in a coherent way. Events and policies that obviously led to increases in GDP are attributed as having deepened the depression.</p>
