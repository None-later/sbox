                                <p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/business/10every.html?_r=1&#038;oref=slogin">Ben Stein</a> finally writes a decent op-ed:</p>
<blockquote><p>And, I do not want my taxes raised. I already pay a staggering amount of tax and I don’t care for it. In fact, I would like to pay no tax at all. I could have so much more to prepare for onrushing old age.  But the unhappy fact is that it’s necessary to raise my taxes and the taxes of all upper-income Americans. (I do wish, however, that “upper income” started just a dollar above me.)  The sad truth of the last two two-term Republican presidents is that their economic premise, the key part of their economic game plan, simply has not done what it’s supposed to do. That is, cutting taxes, especially on upper-income Americans, does not generate so much economic activity that it replaces all the lost I.R.S. take and then some.</p></blockquote>
<p>Stein is a McCain supporter and (as he states) he doesn’t want his taxes raised.  But he offers the right criticisms of the standard free lunch GOP nonsense, which <a href="http://economistmom.com/2008/08/ben-stein-says-taxes-must-come-up">EconomistMom</a> rightfully praises.  But I do have a couple of quibbles:</p>
<blockquote><p>That is, cutting taxes, especially on upper-income Americans, does not generate so much economic activity that it replaces all the lost I.R.S. take and then some. At least those have been the results so far. When Ronald Reagan lowered taxes, personal income tax revenue stagnated from 1982 to 1984. Now, you may say that revenue rose sharply after that. So maybe that was a mixed result … Government spending grew dramatically under President Reagan, very nearly doubling, and leaving us with a federal deficit vastly bigger than the one he inherited.</p></blockquote>
<p>Actually nominal spending did not even double during the Reagan years, which meant the increase in real spending was not that great after all.  In fact, the ratio of Federal spending to GDP stayed virtually the same.  And the increase in real Federal taxes over the 1981 to 1992 period was about 17%.  I think EconomistMom needs to have Ben take a few more remedial classes.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I wrote something about crude oil, inventories and contango below and there were 57 comments including one, from Aaron which refered to this post in the future indicative.</p>
<p>A lot of the discussion is Krugman pro and con (mostly con).  I think I will review my take on his arguments here as an introduction.</p>
<p>I had intended to write another post to clarify a particularly hand waving part of my old post (that is to report on a relative clarification in my own thoughts).  I don&#8217;t think this is the focus of interest, so I will put that after the jump.</p>
<p>Krugman argued that the sharp increase in the price of crude oil was caused by increased demand and the fact that suppliers were already pumping just about all that they could pump (hence an almost vertical supply curve).  I assume he thinks that the sharp decline is due to decreased demand.  He is convinced that speculation in oil futures has not had a large impact on the spot price.</p>
<p>My recollection of his argument is that it was based on 4 claims (modified in part to respond to things I just learned skimming the older thread).</p>
<p>1) Oil is consumed and storage costs are significant.  This makes analogies to housing, Nasdaq and tulips inappropriate.</p>
<p>2) Certainly people speculate in oil futures.  The question is whether this is currently moving the spot price far from where it would be without speculators.</p>
<p>3) Pricing rules can determine prices, but don&#8217;t shift supply and demand curves.  If spot prices move up automatically following futures prices, one would expect supply to exceed consumption &#8212; that is growth of inventories.</p>
<p>4) When an almost vertical supply curve meets and almost vertical demand curve, supply and demand can cause prices to move quickly huge amounts back and forth.</p>
<p>OK back to my &#8220;model&#8221;.  Just to recall, the model assumes that the oil companies have formed a cartel and that it has become more difficult for them to keep each other in line.  The driving force is low expected excess capacity (to ship and refine oil by them or to pump it out of the ground for their suppliers) makes it hard to punish a company which sells petroleum products at a price lower than the secretly agreed markup on the price of oil.</p>
<p>In a model, this would make them impose low inventories of crude oil and gasoline on each other and make them lower the markup increasing the price of crude and reducing the price of refined products including gasoline compared to what it would be if they could precommit to their cartel.</p>
<p>The really shaky part is I then claim that low inventories make them bid against each other more fiercely in the spot market so that all of the benefit from their reduced markups goes to oil exporters (and maybe then some).  This is shaky, because I have forgotten the little I knew about the mechanisms of the the oil spot market and it probably isn&#8217;t the mechanism which I would need for the argument to make sense and &#8230; lots of stuff.</p>
<p>So I have a new way of putting it.  Each Oil company can&#8217;t hold large inventories as that would give them an incentive to break their cartel (dumping the gasoline before the other companies can retaliate and benefiting from the increase in the price of crude oil).  I will just assume that large inventories of crude oil are needed to keep refineries working at full capacity.  If the refiners can&#8217;t hold as much crude in  inventory, their suppliers will hold more.  Now the price of crude includes the cost of holding that inventory essentially the oil exporters are supplying oil *and* storage.  The price is higher than the price of just oil.</p>
<p>Now I do *not* believe that this model has anything to do with the real world.  I do not think the OIL majors are colluding and I don&#8217;t think they would act like agents in game theory if they were.  I don&#8217;t think their markups or storage costs are anything like large enough to fit the huge shifts in price.  In fact, I agree with Krugman. </p>
<p>My old post was an exercise in economic theory.  Fortunately commenters used it as an invitation to talk about the real world.</p>

<blockquote><p>Should Congress make the Bush Tax Cuts Permanent?</p>
<p>Back in April, the Joint Economic Committee put out a press release and report on the Bush Tax cuts.  We are now a few months closer to the election, and seeing increasing pressure from Republicans in Congress to make the Bush tax cuts permanent.  It&#8217;s worth reviewing some of the information so that people attempting to evaluate these issues can understand what it means. </p>
<p>Here are a few pieces of information that are worth remembering:</p>
<p>The federal government has borrowed $1.6 trillion from 2001-2008 to pay for the tax cuts<br />Consequence: all Americans will have to pay for this tax-cut-related debt, reducing their after-tax income.<br />One third of the benefits of the cuts go to the top 1 percent of households; one fifth of the benefits of the revenue reductions went to the top 0.3% of households that earn more than $1 million per year<br />Consequence: inequality in America is increasing, with the top 1% grabbing more of the anemic growth AND the benefits of the Bush revenue reductions; meanwhile, the bottom is stagnating<br />investment and economic growth haven&#8217;t equalled other growth periods<br />Consequence: with anemic growth and other policies that favor the wealthy, the vast majoriy have been hurt, not helped, by the tax cuts<br />making the cuts permanent would cost $3.4 trillion just over the next decade, including borrowing costs&#8211;three times what is needed to close the Social Security funding gap!</p></blockquote>

                                <p><a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/08/obama-tax-plan.html">Greg Mankiw</a> was quite impressed with a graph from <a href="http://www.american.com/archive/2008/august-08-08/the-folly-of-obama2019s-tax-plan">Alex Brill and Alan Viard</a> but <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/08/obamas-tax-plan-and-basic-honesty.html">Jonah Gelbach</a> was not:</p>
<blockquote><p>From what I can tell, the Brill-Viard piece, titled &#8220;The Folly of Obama’s Tax Plan&#8221;, is one of those screeds meant to confuse rather than inform … Now, when you see someone relying on a special case like a two-earner couple with two children, one of whom is a college freshman and the other is exactly 12 and receiving after-school care, you know there&#8217;s cherry-picking going on … To understand how deeply dishonest the Brill-Viard piece is, you need only recognize that each of these three examples is a case in which Obama&#8217;s plan increases the after-tax-and-transfer income available to the people at issue. The rest of their explanation involves Obama&#8217;s proposal to increase the maximum of the current Hope Scholarship Tax Credit for college from $1,800 to $4,000 while keeping the same phaseout range … Marginal tax rates rise under Obama&#8217;s plan in this cherry-picked example (assuming that Brill and Viard haven&#8217;t cooked the numbers themselves) because credits have to be phased out at higher incomes, or else everyone will receive them, making them much more expensive. This is hardly a new concept, and Greg Mankiw surely understands it well. If he and the AEI distortion machine wanted to have an honest debate on Obama&#8217;s tax plan, they could discuss its cost, or they could provide an honest argument over why they think the disincentive effects of higher marginal rates outweigh the benefits of increasing disposable income for lower and middle income folks.  Instead, their argument boils down to making a big deal about the fact that disincentive effects&#8230;.exist! That sort of observation won&#8217;t win you the Nobel prize. The key point that Brill and Viard neglect to note or discuss is that even in their cherry picked example, higher marginal tax rates bring along offsetting benefits to families with lower and middle incomes. If the families don&#8217;t change their behavior, their disposable income will be higher, not lower, under Obama&#8217;s plan. If they do change their behavior, then by revealed preference, these families will still be better off, since every supposedly nefarious change in the tax code that Brill and Viard mention is an expansion in generosity. Revealed preference says that you can&#8217;t be made worse off by having more options. This is a question of basic microeconomics. It&#8217;s also a question of basic honesty.</p></blockquote>
<p>That the AEI would mislead its readers in this way strikes me as old news.  But when a Harvard professor endorses such a distortion, this is really sad.</p>
<p>Update: I should let <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/08/the-median-vote.html">Tyler Cowen</a> have the last word on this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The key point is this: &#8220;Reducing a person’s tax credit as his income goes up also reduces his incentive to earn more income.&#8221;  But before some of you get all upset, I do not intend this presentation as an endorsement of John McCain&#8217;s utterances on fiscal policy.</p>
<p>Addendum: I am not saying that Obama is &#8220;raising taxes on the poor.&#8221;  It is about marginal rates and yes marginal rates do matter for incentives.  This is a genuine problem of many indeed most anti-poverty programs, it is not an attempt to mislead anyone.  Don&#8217;t treat everything as necessitating a response to right- or left-wing talking points.  You still ought to look at this diagram and think that the &#8220;notches&#8221; are too discrete and too strong.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well said!</p>

<blockquote>&#8230;Manzi does not seem to have a consistent view of the concavity of instantaneous indirect utility functions. He argues that it would be absurd to consume the proceeds of the IPO of a successful startup yet he argues that higher taxation of said proceeds will have a large effect on the required minimum probability of success. If he can come up with a utility function which has both of these properties, he might convince someone who cares about economic theory (not typing at the moment). If he further finds a utility function consistent with the data on risk premia and intertemporal substitution he might convince more than one such person. If he can get the sign of the effect the one he wants without ignoring the benefit for people who tried and failed to be entrepreneurs of middle class tax cuts he will convince many.</p>
<p>If he assumes that expected wealth calculations are OK when evaluating whether people will start companies but just idiotic when deciding how quickly they will consume the proceeds, he isn&#8217;t an economic theorist (not that I mean that as a criticism).</p></blockquote>

                                <p>A new <a href="http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d08957.pdf">GAO report</a> [PDF] has made some news by reporting that large fractions of both U.S.-controlled and foreign-controlled corporations report no liabilities under the federal corporate income tax.  In 2005, 25% of &#8220;large&#8221; U.S.-controlled corporations and 67% of all U.S.-controlled corporations reported no tax liability; foreign-controlled corporations reported no tax liability at roughly similar rates (slightly higher overall for GAO&#8217;s study period).</p>
<p>There can be good reasons for this — some corporations, e.g. startups, may not even manage to earn a gross profit in some periods, and many others may (and do) fail to earn net profits after common deductible expenses such as salaries, depreciation, and interest expenses.</p>
<p>Since the headline results may nevertheless be incendiary, there&#8217;s been a fair amount of commentary providing bad reasons why the GAO&#8217;s findings might not be problematic.  One non-explanation concerns &#8220;S&#8221; corporations, where corporate income is passed through to shareholders who then pay taxes on the income through the individual tax system:
</p>
<blockquote><p>An outside tax expert, Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute in Washington, said increasing numbers of limited liability corporations and so-called “S” corporations pay taxes under individual tax codes.</p>
<p>“Half of all business income in the United States now ends up going through the individual tax code,” Edwards said.</p>
<p>The GAO study did not investigate why corporations weren’t paying federal income taxes or corporate taxes and it did not identify any corporations by name. It said companies may escape paying such taxes due to operating losses or because of tax credits.  [<a href="http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2008/08/12/10949/">Via</a>.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The GAO&#8217;s analysis encompasses &#8220;S&#8221;-corp returns, which not surprisingly rarely show corporate tax liabilities, but the headline figures are for corporations filing returns for non-pass-through corporate forms.  (Nor are pass-through forms inherently non-problematic.  As David Cay Johnston reported in <i>Perfectly Legal</i>, audit rates for &#8220;S&#8221;-corps are low, and had been reduced amid the 1990s War on Tax Enforcement; there are ways of turning income into corporate expenses  among other things especially when the IRS isn&#8217;t looking too closely.)</p>
<p>Another bad explanation in reasonable clothing comes from the a Tax Foundation economist quoted by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/business/13tax.html">NYT</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Joshua Barro, a staff economist at the Tax Foundation, a conservative research group, said that&#8230; [t]he vast majority of the large corporations that did not pay taxes had net losses&#8230; and thus no income on which to pay taxes. “The notion that there is a large pool of untaxed corporate profits is incorrect.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The general point that corporations need to have taxable net income to be subject to income tax is correct enough, but not all corporations without taxable income arrive there the same way.  Transfer pricing abuse (paying inflated or deflated prices to related entities for tax avoidance purposes) is a widely acknowledged problem that GAO explicitly did not address in its analysis.  The extent of the problem would not only encompass firms who eliminated their taxable income through transfer pricing abuse, but also firms seeking &#8220;merely&#8221; to shave off the tops of their reported income.  The amount of untaxed corporate profits also depends on the actual, and seemingly considerable, extent of abusive tax-sheltering practices — also beyond the GAO report&#8217;s scope.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s most grabbing about the report is that for corporations reporting positive gross income but zero taxable income, an opaque &#8220;other deductions&#8221; line is the most common one where zero taxable income is established — about 30% across the board of firm sizes and ownership types (the next &#8220;culprits&#8221; are non-officer employee compensation and interest payments).   That line is below the deductions for rank-and-file wages and salaries, officer compensation, rent, interest, depreciation, and many other common deductible expense items.  So you might take that as a measure of the extent of esoteric tax preferences, loopholes, and other income-avoidance methods in the corporate tax code or maybe otherwise.  It does not obviously help make the case for a healthy corporate tax system.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>In reviewing some of the final comments on <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/soc-sec-xli-why-not-assume-low-cost.html">XLI: Why not assume Low Cost</a> the following partial comment caught my eye: &#8220;We are not going to grow our way out of this. And it&#8217;s highly unlikely that we will tax our way out, either.&#8221; To which I would want to ask: &#8220;Who says? And can you give your answer in numeric form?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the mid to late 80&#8217;s the narrative of Social Security &#8216;crisis&#8217; rested on two assumptions. One is that General Fund deficits were structural and could not be eliminated long term. This was summed up in the phrase &#8216;Deficits as far as the eye can see&#8217;. The second assumption was that Boomer retirement would arrive as an irresistable force right as those structural GF deficits were becoming unsustainable. The combination of these two was supposed to set a timetable for fiscal trainwreck right around the late 2020&#8217;s. And really at the time the logic seemed pretty good, in fact good enough that the country was willing to accept some &#8216;voodoo economics&#8217; hoping that tax cuts now would create enough growth to at least mitigate the disaster.</p>
<p>Well one thing didn&#8217;t happen. Those tax cuts did not create growth that trickled down in any amount that would fund those retirement IRAs Cato was pushing as a replacement for Social Security (the Ferrara Plan). And then another thing did happen. Credit it to what or who you want a combination of tax increases, spending restraint and an investment climate served up a federal budget in surplus by 2000, not just in Social Security, which started running strong surpluses around 1998, but in the General Fund as well.</p>
<p>So those predictions so confidently made in the 1980&#8217;s turned out to be flat wrong, those people who said &#8220;We are not going to grow our way out of this. And it&#8217;s highly unlikely we will tax our way out, either&#8221; simply missed the boat. Which really is what inspired XLI. We know that outcomes at or better than Low Cost can happen, because in the period from 1998 to 2003 they did happen. Now as it turns out the 2003 tax cuts ushered in a productivity crash starting almost exactly 18 months after enactment (note I didn&#8217;t say &#8217;caused&#8217;, but the timing is pretty god damn ironic since that is when idiots like Gramm tell us the positive impact of tax cuts should start being observable) and so we did not see the continued improvements after 2003 that some of us were expecting. But the argument that we can never get off the floor seems pretty defeatest. (And yeah I now the argument from tech, and the argument from peak oil, I don&#8217;t find either compelling but will address them in comments if anyone wants.)</p>
<p>So the question really remains: are the economic results needed over the medium term to fully fund Social Security actually impossible? Or even unlikely? And why (and please use numbers)? Or you could flip the question around. What would the implications be for the total economy and more particularly the General Fund deficit if Low Cost happened? </p>
<p>Low Cost is about a lot more than funding Social Security. It goes right to a vision about the future of America. I know what Roubini&#8217;s answer would be to this question, but is there anyone else out there really believing that nothing we could do in the way of taxation and spending policy to get productivity and Real GDP off of the 1.7% and 2.3% floor now being assigned to them by IC?  I mean maybe we can&#8217;t get every half decade to act like the early sixties or the late nineties {ed}, but this notion that the future will never, ever be brighter than it was in 2003 no matter what we do goes beyond defeatism to anti-Americanism. (I thought it was us liberals that hated America and not the Chicago GSB).</p>
<p>I am not here to push Gore&#8217;s plan or Picken&#8217;s plan but if either one&#8217;s vision comes to reality in the next ten years we will be living in a whole new country. We have a Republican Party promising to put a Man on Mars in the next twenty years but they can&#8217;t or won&#8217;t promise 2.1% productivity and 3.3% Real GDP along the way?</p>
<p>Why oh why are economic conservatives running down America&#8217;s future by adopting Intermediate Cost economic assumptions? Or are they just pretending to accept those assumptions to sell Personal Account plans implicitly requiring better growth? Because as Dean Baker pointed out in his 2004 <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/the-no-economist/policy-analyst-left-behind-test-for-social-security/">No Economist Left Behind</a> challenge, you don&#8217;t get to have both.</p>
<p>We know precisely what it would take to tax or grow our way out of at least the Social Security gap, the Trustees tell us in detail. And if we do have those outcomes we should see mirror effects in the General Fund, more GDP, more productivity, more labor participation all translate to more tax revenues. So the question really is for the defeatests: why assume Intermediate Cost? Plus what would be the implications of that for the markets anyway?</p>

<p>Title: Are We Really Running Out of Oil?</p>
<p>This post might give the Peak Oilers pause.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=301792181153291">Arctic Abundance</a> found originally at <a href="http://www.usgs.gov/newsroom/article.asp?ID=1980&#038;from=rss_home">USGS</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>It has become something of an article of faith among those who oppose drilling in the Arctic that it&#8217;s too much trouble for too little oil. Well, how about 90 billion barrels of oil? Too little for you?</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>That&#8217;s how much oil is estimated to be in the Arctic region, with at least a third of it under sovereign U.S. territory, according to a new study by the U.S. Geological Survey.<br />Put into perspective, the U.S. &#8220;official&#8221; estimate for total oil reserves is 21 billion barrels. So by putting our Arctic resources into play, we would more than double our reserves overnight.<br />What&#8217;s more, there could be more oil up there — much more — according to Donald Gautier, who wrote the report.<br />&#8220;Most of the Arctic, especially offshore, is essentially unexplored with respect to petroleum,&#8221; Gautier said. &#8220;The extensive Arctic continental shelves may constitute the geographically largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on Earth.&#8221;<br />That phrase stuck in our mind — &#8220;essentially unexplored.&#8221; How much of the rest of the U.S., including the oil we have offshore, is likewise &#8220;essentially unexplored&#8221;? And this study only counted oil that could be retrieved using current technologies. So Arctic reserves may ultimately prove to be much larger.<br />By the way, the report adds almost as an aside, there&#8217;s also about 1,669 trillion cubic feet of natural gas in the Arctic region. That&#8217;s about 27% of the world&#8217;s total.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>This again puts the lie to the &#8220;peak&#8221; oil theorists, who have asserted repeatedly that the amount of oil we can use is in terminal decline and that it&#8217;s therefore futile to drill for more. It&#8217;s not&#8230;&#8230;In short, we&#8217;re not running out of oil, we&#8217;re swimming in it.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.ibdeditorials.com/IBDArticles.aspx?id=301619245469105">Shale Oil</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Bush on Tuesday said he wants to remove all barriers to extracting the oil thought to be trapped in shale rock formations in a swath of territory encompassing parts of Colorado, Wyoming and Utah.<br />The quantity of oil to be found in this shale is almost unfathomable. The government conservatively puts it at 800 billion barrels. Other estimates say we have as much as 2 trillion barrels, though some of that wouldn&#8217;t be recoverable.<br />As the chart shows, that could potentially give the U.S. oil reserves equal to three times those of Saudi Arabia. Indeed, it would be more oil than in Saudi Ara bia, Iran, Russia, Venezuela, Iraq and Mexico combined.<br />These reserves, if fully exploited, could ensure America&#8217;s energy needs for at least the next century, and possibly longer. As John Hinderaker of the popular Power Line blog notes, 1 trillion barrels of oil is roughly the amount of crude the world has used since oil was first found in Titusville, Pa., in 1859. </p></blockquote>

<p>Short the oil bubble!<br />_____________________________<br />Rdan here:  Sammy indicates he thinks the op-ed is a good summary of current status of the situation. More on this later.</p>
<p>Update:  Some concern has been expressed in comments that the post might indicate implicit endorsement of the views expressed, or that it is offered without an explanation of why it is accurate by the person sending it in.</p>
<p>Guest posts are an important part of Angry Bear offerings.  A more explicit set of guidelines might be useful in general.  We could also offer an op-ed piece as an example of the presentation of a different viewpoint, but do so at the beginning.  Also, sammy could offer more of his own justification and links to better define the idea he is proposing.</p>
<p>Anyway, this post can draw attention to the idea being tossed around of plentiful reserves that are handy.  The piece itself offers no detail, so of course is an advertisement and not a report or even article. The USGS report offers a lot of detail which to my reading suggests much less optimism and certainty.</p>

                                <p>Retail sales were reported down 0.1%, but that included gasoline and groceries.  If you take them out nominal retail sales fell -0.4%.  On a year over year basis real retail sales growth is sitting right about zero.  The BEA deflator data will not be available until the end of the month but I made a rough guess for this months deflator and produced this chart displaying real retail sales in the various cycles. It is a cluttered chart and a little hard to read, but it still tells an interesting story.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKLhtvGNYcI/AAAAAAAAAWk/MMiboJjuLII/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKLhtvGNYcI/AAAAAAAAAWk/MMiboJjuLII/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>Basically, real retail sales look very similar to what they did in other recessions except the mild 1970 and 2001 recessions were consumer spending held up through the downturns.</p>
<p>The really interesting story is the big pop in real retail sales shorty after 9/11.  It really demonstrates how the American public responded.  Moreover, it clearly showed that the pop in consumer spending much more than offset any weakness in travel because of 9/11.  The data makes it obvious  that the meme that 9/11 created massive economic weakness has little or no basis in fact.</p>
<p>The other data released this morning was import prices. Import prices jumped 1.7% and are now up 21.6% over June 2007.  But import prices are weighted very differently then domestic production or consumption deflators.  Over half of imports are agricultural and industrial raw materials, including energy. Final products such as capital goods, autos and other consumer goods account for about half of imports and they are up 2.1%, 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively from a year ago. But commodity prices are now falling and this implies this may be the last big import price increase we see this year..</p>
<p>The number I watch is the import price for consumer goods that excludes both autos and energy. It has now been rising for some time and there has been a clear change in trend.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKLh1za_CfI/AAAAAAAAAWs/kYniuHSz9iw/s1600-h/Clipboard02.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKLh1za_CfI/AAAAAAAAAWs/kYniuHSz9iw/s320/Clipboard02.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>But interestingly, when you look at the deflator for GAFO retail sales it looks like retailers are absorbing much of the increase in consumer goods prices.  GAFO sales can be thought of as a form of core retail sales.  It excludes autos, groceries, service stations and restaurants. Think of it as all the non-food item you find at WMT. It shows that retailers are absorbing much of the increase in import prices rather than passing it on to conusumers.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKLiE67FW7I/AAAAAAAAAW0/bb4pj5A6DCM/s1600-h/Clipboard04.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SKLiE67FW7I/AAAAAAAAAW0/bb4pj5A6DCM/s320/Clipboard04.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />Often you see analysts, including senior federal reserve officers, deflating the major retailers same store sales numbers by the headline CPI and concluding that retail sales are much weaker than they actually are.  For example you will often hear that Wal Mart reporting 3% gains in sames store nonfood sales means that real retail sales are flat when it actually implies that real sales are growing at about 5%.</p>
