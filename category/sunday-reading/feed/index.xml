				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/01/us-usa-asia-arms-sales-idUSBRE90005D20130101?article" target="_blank">Reuters</a> comes this piece on arms spending:</p>
<blockquote><p>Demand for big-ticket U.S. weapons is expected to stay strong for at least the next few years, the trade group said in a 2012 year-end review and forecast released in December.<br />Fears resulting from China&#8217;s growing military spending (bolding mine&#8230;the US has about <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/27/us-arms-sales-2011_n_1833602.html#slide=504167US...4.8%25">4.8% spending to GDP ratio</a>) should lead to enough U.S. sales in South and East Asia to more than offset a slowdown in European arms-buying, according to the forecast.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Dan here:) The graph offers a year to year estimate of China&#8217;s spending to GDP ratio.  What am I Â missing?</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JxKgFLlY6GU/UO7atuiz5RI/AAAAAAAABW0/MD74AmaOmTo/s1600/chinaarms.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JxKgFLlY6GU/UO7atuiz5RI/AAAAAAAABW0/MD74AmaOmTo/s640/chinaarms.PNG" width="640"></a></div>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />The article continues&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>The trade group, whose members include Pentagon suppliers Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp, did not put numbers to its 2013 forecast. Nor did the Pentagon&#8217;s Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which has overseen a boom in worldwide deals under President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>The security agency, in response to a Reuters request, said sales agreements with countries in the U.S. Pacific Command&#8217;s area of activity rose to $13.7 billion in fiscal 2012, up 5.4 percent from a year before. Such pacts represent orders for future delivery.</p>
<p>In 2012 there were about 65 notifications to Congress of proposed government-brokered foreign military sales with a combined potential value of more than $63 billion. In addition, the State Department office that regulates direct commercial sales was on track to receive more than 85,000 license requests in 2012, a new record.</p>
<p>Overall, the United States reached arms transfer agreements in 2011 totaling $66.3 billion, or nearly 78 percent of all such worldwide pacts, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The 2011 total was swollen by a record $33.4 billion deal with Saudi Arabia. India ranked second with $6.9 billion in such agreements.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/20/business/20supply.html?" target="_blank">Stress Test for the Global Supply Chain</a> &#8211; &#8220;Day in and day out, the global flow of goods routinely adapts to all kinds of glitches and setbacks. A supply breakdown in one factory in one country, for example, is quickly replaced by added shipments from suppliers elsewhere in the network. Sometimes, the problems span whole regions and require emergency action for days or weeks. When a volcano erupted in Iceland last spring, spewing ash across northern Europe and grounding air travel, supply-chain wizards were put to a test, juggling production and shipments worldwide to keep supplies flowing.  But the disaster in Japan, experts say, presents a first-of-its-kind challenge, even if much remains uncertain.  Japan is the worldâs third-largest economy, and a vital supplier of parts and equipment for major industries like computers, electronics and automobiles. The worst of the damage was northeast of Tokyo, near the quakeâs epicenter, though Japanâs manufacturing heartland is farther south. But greater problems will emerge if rolling electrical blackouts and transportation disruptions across the country continue for long.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/03/25/made-in-japan-what-is-country-exporting/?mod=WSJBlog" target="_blank">Made in Japan: What Is Country Exporting?</a> &#8211; &#8220;The <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704461304576216950927404360.html" target="_blank">crisis in Japan triggered by the March 11 earthquake</a> hasnât just disrupted domestic production, but also poses problems to trading partners that rely on Japanese goods. (<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704461304576216950927404360.html#articleTabs%3Dinteractive" target="_blank">See an interactive graphic showing Japanâs exports.</a>) Japan is the worldâs fourth-largest exporter and most of the products it sends overseas are machinery and transportation equipment, which include everything from heavy industrial machinery and semiconductors to refrigerators and cars. The country accounts for about 14% of world exports of automotive products.  Japan exported some $469.64 billion of machinery and transportation equipment in 2010. Japan also is a key supplier of advanced components to Asian nations that specialize in the final assembly phase of manufacturing. China depends on Japan for 13% of its imports, largely capital goods such as machine tools and electronic parts for manufacturing. Filed under miscellaneous goods are such products as precision instruments, particularly scientific, optical instruments.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2011/03/23/japan-quake-could-have-big-impact-on-u-s-output/?mod=WSJBlog" target="_blank">Japan Quake Could Have Big Impact on U.S. Output</a> &#8211; &#8220;Investors counting on robust manufacturing data for March may be in for an unpleasant surprise next month. When the March data come out in mid-April it will likely mark the second month in a row of declining U.S. industrial output and could mark the start of a worrying trend. Industrial output slipped 0.1% in February. Why will this decline likely happen? Itâs because the after-effects of the March earthquake in Japan are disrupting automobile manufacturing in North America in a hefty way. This matters because, despite popular belief, automobile manufacturing still is a meaningful part of the industrial sector. Hereâs how itâs playing out: Japan still is a major supplier of parts to U.S.-based car factories. It isnât just Japanese car brands, like Toyota and Honda, which both announced they would temporarily halt production at some plants in the U.S. General Motors has been impacted by the problem, notably furloughing workers in New York state and Louisiana. It doesnât take a supply disruption of many car parts to mean that a auto maker has to halt output for an entire plant, at least temporarily.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704713004576209021068788118.html" target="_blank">Supply Shortages Stall Auto Makers</a> &#8211; &#8220;<a href="http://by129w.bay129.mail.live.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&#038;symbol=GM" target="_blank">General Motors</a> Co. will stop some work at two European factories and is mulling production cuts in South Korea, amid growing uncertainty over how its plants around the world will be affected by the crisis in Japan. A shortage of Japanese-built electronic parts will force GM to close a plant in Zaragoza, Spain, on Monday and cancel shifts at a factory in Eisenach, Germany, on Monday and Tuesday, the company said Friday. Both factories build the Corsa small car. Meanwhile, the company&#8217;s South Korean unit said it is considering cutting production to deal with a potential shortage.&#8221;</p>

Toyota&#8217;s automaking operations in Japan have been halted since March 14 as it reviews the condition of suppliers providing the 20,000 or more components that make up vehicles.  Auto engineers scouring the northeastern region have found many facilities that were damaged and others that were destroyed, and most automakers haven&#8217;t completed their assessments.  Toyota&#8217;s U.S. manufacturing subsidiary in Erlanger, Ky., told its U.S. employees, plant workers and dealers Wednesday that some production interruptions in North America were likely. The automaker said it could not predict which sites would be affected or for how long. Most of the components used in Toyota&#8217;s North American assembly operations come from some 500 suppliers in the region.&#8221;</p>

That&#8217;s especially true when it comes to microprocessors, which control everything from an engine&#8217;s fuel mix to the car&#8217;s global positioning system.About one in every five microprocessors is made in <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Places,+Geography/Countries/Japan" target="_blank">Japan</a>, and many are made at plants that were severely damaged in the March 11 <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Events+and+Awards/In-depth+Coverage/Haiti+Earthquake" target="_blank">earthquake</a> and tsunami. So just as U.S. auto sales gather steam, the unexpected war in <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Places,+Geography/Countries/Libya" target="_blank">Libya</a>, surging gas prices and now production cuts triggered by the earthquake have thrown uncertainty into automakers&#8217; rosy 2011 outlook. Automakers could lose production of up to 5 million vehicles in the next four months,&#8221;</p>

Even American automakers are not immune, as they import parts from Japan. <a href="http://investing.money.msn.com/investments/stock-price?symbol=gm&#038;s=qbeb" target="_blank">General Motors</a><a href="http://investing.money.msn.com/investments/stock-price?symbol=gm&#038;s=qbeb" target="_blank"> (GM)</a> temporarily stopped production at a plant in Louisiana and laid off more than 50 workers at a plant in New York. But the Japanese automakers are the hardest hit, with recovery efforts hampered by widespread power outages.  <i>Post continues after video about Toyota and Honda production:</i>&#8220;</p>
<p><a href="http://carfanatics.org/thread-4359.html" target="_blank">Toyota and Ford to stop making cars in certain colors</a> &#8211; &#8220;Automakers may run low on certain paint colors because of a shortage of a pigment produced in an area close to the damaged Fukushima-Daiichi nuclear power plant in northeastern Japan. Ford Motor Co. has alerted dealers to stop ordering vehicles in tuxedo black and three shades of red. Toyota Motor Corp. and Chrysler Group LLC also are among automakers that will be affected by the pigment shortage. The German pigment manufacturer Merck Group confirmed that the Japanese plant that makes a pigment called Xirallic had halted production because it was in the exclusion zone around the damaged nuclear power complex&#8230;once engineers can get inside the plant, the company believes production can be restarted in four to eight weeks.&#8221;</p>

The intensity first spurred by rising gas prices has been amplified by predicted shortages of many models as the Japanese auto industry remains disrupted by the March 11 <a href="http://content.usatoday.com/topics/topic/Events+and+Awards/In-depth+Coverage/Haiti+Earthquake" target="_blank">earthquake</a> and its aftermath. &#8220;We&#8217;ve gone from 60 (Priuses) in stock to 16&#8221; over the last two months, . A dozen are coming, &#8220;but we are told they are going to dwindle&#8221; quickly after that. Indicating the shortages may not be brief, Honda has told dealers it&#8217;s not taking orders for any vehicles made in Japan in May. March and April orders already were delayed.&#8221;</p>

Business analysts don&#8217;t expect large cutbacks, but anticipate that some Indiana plants that employ about 50,000 autoworkers will use short workweeks, scattered short-term layoffs and slower line speeds to keep workers busy during the downturn.  &#8220;I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s going to be a major event. It&#8217;s not clear yet,&#8221; said economist Thomas Klier of the <a href="http://by129w.bay129.mail.live.com/topic/economy-business-finance/financial-business-services/banking/federal-reserve-bank-of-chicago-ORNPR000016.topic" target="_blank">Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago</a> told The Indianapolis Star. &#8220;We still don&#8217;t know what the extent of the damage actually is in Japan.&#8221; Trying to determine which plants might be affected by the tumult in Japan is made difficult by the global supply chain that has developed in recent years. Subaru, Toyota and Honda assemble vehicles in Indiana, but the supply system runs to almost every major automaker.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/business/7490315.html" target="_blank">Bracing for the pinch on auto parts from Japan</a> &#8211; &#8220;The disaster in Japan already is affecting the U.S. auto industry. Two key questions now are, how much and for how long?  Toyota&#8217;s 13 factories in the United States, Canada and Mexico have been told to expect shortages of parts made in Japan, and U.S. makers that use Japanese parts also are expecting supply disruptions. And that could mean a temporary drop in inventoriesfor some high-demand vehicles in Texas showrooms. &#8220;The biggest unknown in the industry is the parts supply chain,&#8221; said Jesse Toprak, vice president of industry trends at TrueCar.com, a new car pricing site.  Parts shortages could reduce global auto production by about 30 percent&#8221;</p>

About 320,000 vehicles may have been lost worldwide as of March 24, and manufacturing at plants in North America may be affected when parts supplies start running out as soon as early April, said Michael Robinet, vice president of Lexington, Massachusetts-based IHS Automotive.âThe next surge of shutdowns comes when the pipeline of parts that were already built dries up,â Robinet said yesterday in a telephone interview. âThe rate of lost production will accelerate once North American plants join in.â Toyota Motor Corp., the worldâs largest automaker, said it has lost output of 140,000 vehicles, and Honda Motor Co. has lost 46,600 cars and trucks and 5,000 motorcycles. Mitsubishi Motors Corp.âs was lowered by 15,000. Ford Motor Co. hasnât lost any output, said Todd Nissen, a spokesman.&#8221;</p>

This translates to a drop of as many as 100,000 vehicles per day, IHS analyst Michael Robinet said, adding there could be more North American plant shutdowns in the meantime. &#8220;We&#8217;re already feeling the impact in Japan,&#8221;  &#8220;North America, Europe, China: those three areas for sure will feel some impact.&#8221; Last week, General Motors Co (<a href="http://www.reuters.com/finance/stocks/overview?symbol=GM.N" target="_blank">GM.N</a>) idled its pick-up truck plant in Shreveport, Louisiana. Toyota Motor Co is likely to idle its own pickup truck plant south of San Antonio.The delivery of parts from transmissions to electronics to semiconductors is being hampered by the Japanese earthquake and subsequent infrastructure problems. About 13 percent of the global auto industry output has been lost now because of parts shortages, Robinet said.The slowdowns could grow even more severe by the third week of April.&#8221;</p>

The company has shut eight plants in Miyagi, Ibaraki and Fukushima prefectures, and workers are inspecting equipment and facilities, he said. Toyota has said it will keep 21 auto and components plants closed until March 22.  Sony and Toyotaâs efforts to resume production are complicated by the need for hundreds of different components to build TVs and cars from a variety of different suppliers that may have suffered plant damage in the earthquake and tsunami. <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/japan/" target="_blank">Japan</a> is also facing electricity shortages because a nuclear- power plant was crippled by the temblor.  âThis will be played out not in days, but in weeks,â . âNothing on this scale has really occurred before.â&#8221;</p>

The Finnish mobile phone maker, which sources about 12 per cent of its components in Japan, said the disaster was likely to affect its manufacturing and supply schedules. âNokia expects some disruption to the ability . . . to supply a number of products due to the currently anticipated industry-wide shortage of relevant components and raw materials sourced from Japan,â the company said. The Japanese disaster has exposed the risks associated with modern global supply chains, in which companies rely on just-in-time deliveries from a network of global suppliers with little surplus inventory to cushion them from any disruption. Technology manufacturers are particularly exposed to Japan because of its importance as a supplier of semiconductors and other critical components in products such as mobile phones and computers. Several big Japanese technology companies, including Panasonic, Hitachi, Nikon, NEC and Sony, have reported disruption either from earthquake damage or power shortages since the disaster. Ericsson, the Swedish network equipment maker, and Sony Ericsson, its mobile phone joint venture with Sony, are among other non-Japan-based companies which have so far warned of supply chain problems.&#8221;</p>

The trade publication observed that while the final assembly of those products takes place in other Asian countries, the components are made in Japan. With Sony, Nintendo, Panasonic, Canon, Nikon and other Japanese-based electronics companies forced to shut down plans, parts shortages are likely to increase prices of many items and produce product scarcity even into the holiday season, AdAge observed. Earlier this week research group iSuppli reported that two Japanese plants that account for 25 percent of the global supply of silicon wafers had been forced to suspend operations. Moreover, two other companies that account for 70 percent of the worldwide supply of the main raw material used to make printed circuit boards have also temporarily shut down.&#8221;</p>
