<p>32.  Note that the US constitution grants the same due process rights to citizens and non citizens. </p>
<p>This time I pick on <a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2013/03/25/17458228-right-policy-wrong-questions?lite" target="_blank">Steve Benen</a> who wrote</p>
<p>&#8220;The drones themselves are a fairly new tool, but the use of technology is tangential to the underlying point about the use of force, and in the case of U.S. citizens accused of terrorism abroad, due process rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>My comment</p>
<p>You seem to be of the impression that the due process rights of US citizens are different than the due process rights of non citizens &#8221; in the case of U.S. citizens accused of terrorism abroad, due process rights.&#8221;  There is no basis for this view in the constitution.  The 5th amendment declares that there are due process rights (its framers certainly saw this as recognizing a fact not creating a right).  It contains no reference at all to citizenship.</p>
<p>Here is the 5th Amendment</p>
<p>&#8220;No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>How do you imagine that an amendment which begins &#8220;no person&#8221; implies that due process rights are an issue only in the case of citizens ?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t just my reading of the text (which is not at all ambiguous).  US courts have consistently held that non citizens have due process rights (note I didn&#8217;t say &#8220;all non citizens&#8221;).</p>
<p>Hmm it sure sounds like the 5th amendment bans war which involves killing people without giving them trials first.  The many provisions for declaring war and such like are in the main body of the Constitution and might be considered repealed by the 5th (as the provision that states must return escaped slaves is not considered to be current constitutional law).  Similarly the common law right to use deadly force in self defence might be considered to have been eliminated by the 5th amendment.</p>
<p>But I might not be crazy and I don&#8217;t imagine for a second that the 5th amendment banned war or self defence. I do insist that it allows no distinction between US citizens and non citizens.  The Civil war was particularly horrible, but the legality of union troops killing confederate troops in battle was not (widely) contested.</p>
<p>It is clear that the 5th amendment concerns killing people who are in government custody, that is the death penalty.  It does not refer to killing people who haven&#8217;t been captured and can&#8217;t feasibly be captured.</p>

                                <p>Lifted by Dan from <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.it/2013/03/marcus-mark-ii.html">Robert&#8217;s Stochastic thoughts</a> </p>
<p>Robert writes:</p>
<p>I was reasonably sure that the latest Ruth Marcus column would cause me to have to  revise and update my earlier post declaring her a heroine of <em>Ballance</em>.   She comments on the fact  that Republican representatives live-tweeted snark during the question and answer session with Republican representatives (which was closed to the public because they looked like fools) when it was on TV ((until Fox News cut away to something else, which tells you all you need to know)). </p>
<p>It is very hard to draw ballanced conclusions from a discussion of such an event.  To my amazement Marcus managed.  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ruth-marcus-obama-has-to-be-dealmaker-in-chief/2013/03/14/9714cff4-8cce-11e2-b63f-f53fb9f2fcb4_story.html?hpid=z2">This column</a> has it all. 1) Bipartisanthink, 2) the cult of the Presidency, 3) a dumb metaphor, 4) recognition that the conclusion is false part way through 5) disrespect for public opinion   6) above all, love of a grand bargain.   </p>
<p>1) &#8220;But failure would not only tarnish Republicans; it would also stain Obama’s legacy. &#8221;    </p>
<p>2) &#8220;Great presidential leadership entails figuring out how to deal with even those who do not like you.&#8221;    <br />(note that Ruth Marcus has just asserted that Lincoln wasn&#8217;t a great President).    </p>
<p>3) &#8220;The president portrayed himself as a sort of maitre d’ for budget negotiations, setting the table for others to forge an agreement. &#8221;    </p>
<p>4) &#8220;It’s true that there are times when presidential intervention in delicate congressional negotiations can be counterproductive. It’s certainly true that there are times when congressional Democrats have advised the White House to butt out. &#8220;<br />    <br />&#8220;Perhaps he’s posturing; if the president is seen as coveting a deal too much, he won’t be able to get the kind he wants. Perhaps it’s simple realism; Republicans’ refusal to consider revenue raised by curtailing loopholes is unacceptable, and the president shouldn’t accept a cuts-only deal.&#8221;    </p>
<p>5) &#8220;he is the one who is going to have to sell the notion of unpopular changes — curbing Medicare spending, reducing Social Security benefits or curtailing popular tax breaks — to a nation that says it wants a balanced bargain but may balk when that bargain is translated into painful specifics.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Notice that the proper response to such a &#8220;balk&#8221; is presidential leadership not doing what the public wants.  Marcus is assuming her readers assume the public is more ignorant than it is and will be shocked to find out about the painful specifics.  But the public has spoken (to pollsters).  Huge majorities oppose cutting Medicare or Social Security to reduce the deficit.  Marcus has lost confidence in the public and a new public will have to be elected.  She just assumes that Obama must find a way to reach agreement with Republicans (which is impossible) in order to widen the tax base and cut social security and Medicare although the public supports at most one of those actions (solid majorities support higher taxes on high incomes and support reducing tax expenditures in the abstract but that doesn&#8217;t mean a majority would support say eliminating the mortgage interest deduction).   </p>
<p>It is very clear what the public wishes to be left undone.  This public view is unacceptable to Marcus, so she asserts that Obama must find some way to give the public what it doesn&#8217;t want by working with Republicans who hate him.    <br />6) &#8220;the president sounded distinctly pessimistic about the prospects for such a bargain and disturbingly unconcerned about failing to reach one. That, he said, would be more missed opportunity than “crisis.”&#8221;  <br />heh indeed.  So Marcus is disturbed by the claim that a failure to reach a grand bargain wouldnìt be a crisis. Does this mean she thinks it would be a crisis ?  She doesn&#8217;t say.  The fact that no level of conern about the risk of failint to reach one is eccessive is too obvious for there to be any need for Marcus to argue the point.</p>
<p>The math, by the way, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/03/13/our-deficits-arent-as-bad-as-washington-thinks/">does not demand it.</a></p>

                                <p>This post will be long, fairly wonky, and confused.  I am typing, because I just have  to stop playing with <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/">FRED</a> and write something.   My claim is that expected inflation over the next 5 (and 10 and 20) years is very similar to actual inflation over the past year.  I think the data generally fit the crudest most mechanical adaptive expectations hypothesis.</p>
<p>This would be interesting for two reasons. </p>
<p>First, the adaptive expectations hypothesis has been treated with utter contempt for roughly 4 decades.  It is considered an example of the sort of thing which economists must utterly reject.  The effort to replace it has lead to a lot of mildly interesting math and highly implausible assumptions. </p>
<p>Second, there is a huge and very vigorous discussion of forward guidance by the Fed Open Market (FOMC) Committee.  It has been argued that even when the Federal Funds rate is essentially zero, the FOMC can stimulate the economy by causing higher expected inflation.  It is generally agreed that the FOMC has been convinced by this argument.  I think this implies that there should be anonalous increases in expected inflation on the dates when the FOMC began to try to cause higher expected inflation &#8212; roughly the announcements of QE 1-4, operation twist and of forward guidance of how long it will keep the Federal Funds rate extremely low.  An excellent fit of expected inflation using only lagged inflation creates serious difficulty for those who think the FOMC always could and finally has promoted higher expected inflation.</p>
<p>I think I will put the actual post after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I will show time series and scatter graphs of two time series one of which should be lagged inflation and one of which should correspong roughly to expected inflation.  Here&#8217;s a graph before the reader gets too bored.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ueK70-TT-w8/USuN9vZaYpI/AAAAAAAAAkQ/imx2h5Xkcl4/s1600/cpiadapt.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ueK70-TT-w8/USuN9vZaYpI/AAAAAAAAAkQ/imx2h5Xkcl4/s640/cpiadapt.JPG" height="387" width="640"></a></div>
<p>My variables for lagged inflation are the percent increase in the consumer price index (CPI) (blue)  and CPI excluding food an energy (green).  My variable for expected inflation is the 5 year constant maturity TIPS breakeven (in red explained below).  Notably all three variables fluctuate, but the breakeven is usually between the two measures of past inflation or very near the closer of the two.  The exception is during the total freakout late 2008 and early 2009.</p>
<p>I should stress that this is not all information available to market participants.  The price indices are reported monthly.  The price index for a month is reported during the next month.  I will look at asset prices the month of the prices and not after the prices are reported.  I think this is a minor problem, since the prices of ordinary goods and services are sticky and I am using changes over a full year.  I did it because it is quick and easy. </p>
<p>My variable for expected inflation is the 5 year constant maturity TIPS breakeven.  I have taken the monthly average of the daily series so the frequency is the same as the freequency of measured past inflation.  It is the difference beteen the return on regular nominal treasuries which pay dollars in 5 years compared to the Fed staff&#8217;s estimate of the real 5 year return on Treasury inflation protected securities (TIPS) which pay a multiple of the CPI (that is are bonds indexed to the CPI).  Both series are constructed by fitting a yield curve to the market prices of bonds.  This is especially problematic for the TIPS real interest rate series, because there are rather few different TIPS.   The 5 year constant maturity series involves some fairly heroic interpolation. </p>
<p>Fed staff (among others) stress that the TIPS breakeven is not equal to market particpants expected inflation.  The reason is that regular nominal Treasuries are more liquid and their price includes a liquidity premium.  The expected return on TIPS is generally higher, so the breakeven is general lower than expected inflation.  During the period of total panic and desperate quest for ready cash or equivalent, the liquidity premium appears to have become huge.  TIPS became very cheap compared to regular tresuries and the breakeven became negative.  I don&#8217;t deal with this, but just consider the months of blind terror to be exceptional.  I assume they were September 2008 through May 2009.</p>
<p>OK another graph.  Here I use a weighted average of the two series for lagged inflation.  The green line is<br />core CPI inflation times 0.75 plus CPI inflation times 0.25.  The weight was chosen by eyeballing and trying to make the green line look like the red line.</p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UUcDkrWLsTo/USuQcd_QGlI/AAAAAAAAAkc/FubkM5q_wNU/s1600/cpiadapt2.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UUcDkrWLsTo/USuQcd_QGlI/AAAAAAAAAkc/FubkM5q_wNU/s640/cpiadapt2.JPG" height="384" width="640"></a></div>
<p>I think the series are dramatically similar (except for the panic period late 2008 through early 2009). </p>
<p>To check more (I apologise for the graphs &#8212; I am having computer trouble and made them in excel) I look at the scatter.  In the first scatter I have the 5 year constant maturity breakeven on the y axis and the weighted average past year inflation on the x axis.  I have connected the dots to show that the ones with very low breakevens all occured at roughly the same time.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_8w9Ab_YoZg/USuSXy68x1I/AAAAAAAAAko/nj_x0WX6Vt4/s1600/cpiadapt3.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_8w9Ab_YoZg/USuSXy68x1I/AAAAAAAAAko/nj_x0WX6Vt4/s640/cpiadapt3.JPG" height="402" width="640"></a></div>
<p>except for the 8 funny months (September 2008 through April 2009) that is an amazing scatter.  I stress that it shouldn&#8217;t be that way &#8212; there is little useful information in the month to month fluctuations in inflation in the past 12 months.  Also there is almost no room for the effects of QE and other forward guidance.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t resist two more graphs.  One shows the same variables for the period May 2009 through January 2013.  The scatter is very compact.  The slope is slightly under one.  There does seem to be less impact of lagged inflation over 2% on expected inflation.
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sBKNHtuuEVE/USuUAHvBuaI/AAAAAAAAAkw/FLLLSV8Vi-w/s1600/cpiadapt4.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-sBKNHtuuEVE/USuUAHvBuaI/AAAAAAAAAkw/FLLLSV8Vi-w/s640/cpiadapt4.JPG" height="466" width="640"></a></div>
<p>Now the graph which amazes me the most.  This shows data from before the fall of the house of Lehman.  This was during the great moderation.  the Fed aimed roughly to target inflation at about 2% and keep unemployment pretty low.  More importantly, it was generally believed that the Fed could achieve its aims.  Yet the breakeven fluctuated with lagged inflation.  The slope is again slightly under one (zero would correspond more closely to prevailing theory). </p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_sZT85fEV8/USuU_Ih3yTI/AAAAAAAAAk4/O3L39XmJJF8/s1600/cpiadapt5.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Y_sZT85fEV8/USuU_Ih3yTI/AAAAAAAAAk4/O3L39XmJJF8/s640/cpiadapt5.JPG" height="440" width="640"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>I think the much ridiculed adaptive expectations hypothesis is pretty much what&#8217;s in the data.  Also I challenge anyone to find the months of the FOMC&#8217;s much ballyhood announcements in the scatters.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>OK one last graph.  Here I add the 20 year constant maturity breakeven (blue).   This should be totally different from the 5 year breakeven (for one thing no one imagines that Bernanke can inform us about monetary policy in the 2030s).  But it is about the same (recall the heroic interpolation the 5 year and 20 year series are constructed from the same fairly few prices).</div>

                                <p>Via Robert Waldmann <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-24/making-risk-taking-riskier-will-hurt-startups.html%22">Richard Thaler</a> at <i>Bloomberg</i> provides a different take on innovators and job creators:</p>
<blockquote><p>A recurring theme of this year’s presidential campaign is the need to encourage the formation of new businesses. Republicans in general, and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/mitt-romney/">Mitt Romney</a> in particular, have stressed that the best way to stimulate such startups is via low tax rates on high-income earners.<br />…<br />In other words, this is a strategy that emphasizes maximizing the after-tax returns if and when you hit it big. Yet if you think about the way most new businesses are started, it should be clear that these tax incentives have very <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-10-10/the-real-reason-romney-s-tax-math-doesn-t-add-up.html">little to do</a> with the decisions facing most new entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>The typical business startup (think Joe the Plumber) begins with an initial stake that has been saved or borrowed, and 97 percent of small-business owners make less than $250,000 a year. It is a good bet that when <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/bill-gates/">Bill Gates</a>, <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/steve-jobs/">Steve Jobs</a> and <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/larry-page/">Larry Page</a> were creating their new businesses in their proverbial garages, they weren’t giving much thought to the tax rate they would have to pay if they struck it rich.<br />…<br />The essence of Stewart’s idea goes to the heart of why our economy is largely organized around limited-liability public corporations. When successful entrepreneurs decide to take their businesses public, they are selling some of the upside to other shareholders in return for making sure that they can’t lose all their wealth if something at the company goes wrong.</p>
<p>So-Called Reform</p>
<p>What about smaller startups that don’t begin their lives as corporations? One thing that would help stimulate this sort of business creation is making sure that a business bankruptcy is not ruinous to the entrepreneur’s family. But the Republican- sponsored bankruptcy “reform” <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2007-10-28/bankruptcy-reform-bites-back">law of 2005</a> changed the rules in the opposite direction. For someone who uses a <a href="http://topics.bloomberg.com/credit-card/">credit card</a> to help open a bakery or landscaping business, this law raised the cost of failure.</p></blockquote>

<p>1) Reasonable and reasonably honest conservative list update: Josh Barro is very reasonable and quite honest. But is he still a conservative?  <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-01-14/will-obama-ruin-the-economy-to-ruin-the-republicans-.html">He sure doesn&#8217;t always sound like one.</a></p>
<p>2) About  #1) see an example of the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kleiman+ness+monster&#038;rlz=1C1FDUM_enIT485IT485&#038;oq=kleiman+ness+monster&#038;aqs=chrome.0.57j5j0l2j62l2.3635&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8">ness monster</a>:    <br />&#8220;But the conservative worldview is robust because of its imperviousness to evidence.&#8221; which clearly means ”But the conservative worldview is robust because it&#8217;s impervious to evidence.&#8221;</p>
<p>3) What&#8217;s with the Bloomberg Headline person ? The article explains how Conservative&#8217;s are insane and might destroy the economy to make their prediction that it will be destroyed if Obama is re-elected true.   <br />&#8220;Conservatives are sure that the Obama presidency will lead to an economic calamity, and they will prove it, if necessary.&#8221; but the headline suggests that Obama might ruin the economy.</p>
<p>Will Obama Ruin the Economy to Ruin the Republicans?</p>
<p>Did the person who wrote the headline actually read the article ?<br /> (lightly edited for readability)</p>

<p>Everything is possible and I think that Dean Baker just lost a debate with a Washington Post reporter.<br />   <br />Post reporter Zachary A. Goldfarb  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/economists-obama-administration-at-odds-over-role-of-mortgage-debt-in-slow-recovery/2012/11/22/dc83f25e-2e87-11e2-89d4-040c9330702a_story.html">wrote</a></p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1961211">The two economists compared what happened in U.S. counties where people had amassed huge debts with those where people had borrowed little.</a> It had long been thought that when property values declined in value, homeowners would spend less because they would feel less wealthy. <br />But Mian and Sufi’s research showed something more specific and powerful at work: People who owed huge debts when their home values declined cut back dramatically on buying cars, appliances, furniture and groceries. The more they owed, the less they spent. People with little debt hardly slowed spending at all.</p></blockquote>
<p>among other things.  The link is his.  </p>
<p>Dean Baker <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/underwater-homeowners-cannot-explain-the-weak-recovery">wrote</a>  <br />
<blockquote>The <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&#038;q=housing+wealth+effect&#038;btnG=&#038;as_sdt=1%2C9&#038;as_sdtp=">housing wealth</a> effect is one of the oldest and most widely accepted concepts in economics. It is generally estimated people spend between 5 and 7 cents each year per dollar of housing wealth. This means that the collapse of the bubble would be expected to cost the economy between $400 billion and $560 billion in annual demand. </p></blockquote>
<p>among other things  Again the link is his.<br />   <br />Baker&#8217;s main point is that low consumption by underwater home owners is not a plausible explanation of the sluggish recovery.  However, he also confidently asserts that the housing wealth effect is linear based on &#8220;google it&#8221;.  I think that he has decided that new empirical research is irrelevant, because he already knew how economies work.<br />    <br />My comment below the fold.</p>
<p>In the comment I define your disagreement with post reporter  Zachary A. Goldfarb as a disagreement about whether reduced but still positive home equity causes a reduction of consumption on the order of between 5 and 7 cents each year per dollar of housing wealth or on the order of zero.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>    <br />That is, I won&#8217;t address you valid points that the recovery of consumption was roughly normal while the recovery of house construction was not.</p>
<p>Notably Goldfarb cites empirical estimates based on micro data.  He claims there is a significant change in the slope of the home equity effect on consumption at home equity equals zero.  To say he is wrong, you must convince me that the 5 to 7 % estimate is valid for a sample containing only homeowners with positive equity.<br />    <br />An estimate with aggregate data just does not address the claim in the article which you criticize.    <br />Notably, in this case the Washington Post cites specific research by named economists.  You, in contrast, cite what all macroeconomists know.<br />    <br />I am shocked to find that I call this one for The Washington Post.  Your conclusion may be correct, but your reasoning is based on the assumption that all functions are linear.  I don&#8217;t like to be square, but that&#8217;s not true.</p>

<p>At Frum forum <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/20/republicans-have-a-size-problem.html">Justin Green extensively quotes Jeb Golonkin</a> on how conservatism could be much better if conservatives made specific policy proposals.  Sad but true, almost all of the proposals that have been signed into law are by Barack Obama.  This is not a rare event.  While many conservatives stick to slogans, some try to come up with constructive alternatives to the stimulus (ARRA) and Obamacare (PPACA).  I don&#8217;t remember where to link but the phenomenon of “<em>Obamacare is horrible and we should replace it with Obamacare</em>” is quite common.</p>
<p><strong> Golonkin&#8217;s proposals are in</strong> bold, and then another of my comments follows. Recall that the PPACA is Obamacare and the ARRA is the stimulus bill.</p>
<p>Golonkin&#8217;s problem is that Obama has been there and done that.  Golonkin&#8217;s innovative conservative proposals are mostly existing liberal policies.</p>
<p>Golonkin:  Somewhere along the way, we conservatives stopped innovating and stopped explaining, preferring instead to fall back to “small government is better.” Well, maybe it is and maybe it is not. But the notion that government is always useless simply does not ring true in a world where people look to the government to provide Medicare, a national defense, FEMA relief, and public education. This being the case, we would do well to start probing for specific policy solutions that affect people in concrete ways. What is the government doing that is hurting small businesses today? What is the government not doing that it could be that could help small businesses? </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br /> It is not now organizing health insurance exchanges to remove big businesses advantage in insuring employees, because big business work forces are automatically large pools of policy holders helping big but not small businesses interacting with health insurers avoid the adverse selection death spiral.  It would also be nice, above and beyond the call of eliminating a market failure, to offer them subsidies.  See &#8216;healthcare fiasco&#8217;.</p>
<p>Golonkin: <em>What about student debt?</em> </p>
<p> How about ceasing to pay banks huge amounts of money to handle simple paper work and divide the savings between reducing the federal deficit and reducing the amount students have to pay on their debt.  See &#8216;healthcare fiasco&#8217;</p>
<p>Golonkin: Can we use student loan forgiveness as a way to incentivize bright young people to enter particular fields? We need more primary care physicians if we are going to make this healthcare fiasco work. No one wants to be a primary care physician because primary care physicians get paid less than specialists, which makes it harder for them to pay off their medical school debts. But could we change the way the government reimburses primary care? And couldn’t we partially forgive student loans if borrowers agree to enter into primary care in particular markets for a certain number of years?</p>
<p> See &#8216;healthcare fiasco&#8217; and click http://bit.ly/Y6ObIP (warning a *.doc will download)<br />So far all of the bright innovating conservative ideas are provisions of the &#8216;healthcare fiasco&#8217;.  Some are not current policy because they are scheduled to start in January 2014, but mr &#8216;specifics specifics specifics&#8217; didn&#8217;t let that little detail prevent him from arguing that a bill which is largely not yet being applied and of which he demonstrates astonishing ignorance is a &#8216;fiasco&#8217;.  </p>
<p>Golonkin:  <em>What about tax policy: why are we not on the cutting edge of hyper-targeted tax cuts that we can show, with numbers, turbocharge the economy?       </em>     A wish is not a plan.  Wishing that conservatives can show, with numbers, that there are tax cuts that turbocharge the economy doesn&#8217;t make it possible.  There are many conservative academic economists who have looked very hard for proof that some sort of tax cuts turbocharge the economy.  They haven&#8217;t shown this, because it is not true.  yes many conservatives consider numbers foreign alien and un-American (especially arabic numbers).  However there are also conservatives who love numbers and are statistical and mathematical geniuses.  The reason they haven&#8217;t shown with numbers how wonderful tax cuts can be is that it is impossible to show something false with numbers.  The high respect of &#8216;numbers&#8217; is for their power as tools for convincing people.  </p>
<p>Golonkin doesn&#8217;t need to look at any numbers to be sure it is possible to show with numbers that some tax cuts are great.  This is not the way anyone who knows what data are talks about it.  Conservatives, including Golonkin, have the very serious problem of thinking they know the answer before looking at the evidence.   <br />Also I fear that Golonkin believes his hyper targeted tax cut proposal is pro market.  It is, in fact, based on his conviction that policy makers (provided they are conservative) can guess better than the market and wisely subsidize particular activities. The pro market position is that tax rates should not be targeted but rather that the playing field should be level.</p>
<p>Golonkin:  Why are we not demanding that the government rebuild our cratering infrastructure rather than using taxpayer dollars to invest in projects it hopes will succeed (Solyndra)?<br /><strong></strong>  </p>
<p>Yes how about spending more on infrastructure ?  Nothing like the ARRA but spending on infrastructure.  How did Golonkin manage to avoid the phrase &#8216;shovel ready&#8217; ?  He is now calling for the ARRA.  Also he doesn&#8217;t recognize that hyper targeted tax cuts are using taxpayer dollars to invest in etc.  It doesn&#8217;t matter if the money is called a tax cut or a subsidy or even the market value of a CDS (loan guarantee) as in the case of Solyndra.  The policy he advocates and the policy he mocks are implementations of the exact same reasoning.</p>
<p>Golonkin:  Why are we not pushing pay for performance in the healthcare system AND in our education system? </p>
<p> Pay for performance in the healthcare system.  See &#8216;healthcare fiasco&#8217; and click   <br />http://www.lifehealthpro.com/2011/04/29/ppaca-hhs-starts-medicare-performance-payment-syst    <br />pay for performance in education recall the ARRA and google &#8216;race to the top&#8217;    </p>
<p>Golonkin: Workfare?<br />    <br />Workfare was introduced under Reagan and tightened later.  This is the system before the welfare reform of 1996.  It was learned that it costs more to give welfare recipients money and make them work than to just give them money so states backslid and it never amounted to much.  It is an experiment that all agree failed.</p>
<p>Golonkin: Some of these ideas are useless, some of them might have legs, but the point is: specifics, specifics, specifics.</p>
<p> So we see what happens when a conservative tries to think of constructive policy proposals.  There is the wish that conservative claims be &#8216;shown with numbers&#8217; plus Obama policy after Obama policy after Obama policy.  </p>
<p>I think Golonkin should spend more time and effort on understanding the enemy. He might discover that the enemy is not the enemy but rather what he dreams conservatism might one day become.</p>
<p>The shocking thing is that this pathetic display of ignorance is described as &#8220;particularly fine work&#8221; by non movement conservative <a href="http://blogs.forbes.com/markadomanis/">Mark Adomanis</a> in Forbes in a post entitled <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/markadomanis/2012/11/21/epistemic-closure-in-action-at-national-review-before-dismissing-krugman-you-need-to-read-him/">&#8220;Epistemic Closure in Action &#8230;&#8221;</a><br />Golonkin is not the example of epistemic closure.  He is considered a &#8220;particularly fine&#8221; example of how some conservatives are working to overcome epistemic closure.  The detail that the conservative in question has new conservatives ideas which are almost all either in the PPACA or the ARRA and that he doesn&#8217;t know this, does not make the Galonkin essay an example of epistemic closure.  <br />Rather it is an example of how some conservatives are trying to overcome it and understand liberals before denouncing us.  </p>
<p>I am tempted to type &#8220;pathetic&#8221; but I don&#8217;t pity them, I fear them. They are very numerous and their blind ideological arrogance makes them dangerous.</p>
<p>Note, the two conservatives in question are Green and Golonkin.</p>

                                <p>by Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I think this is <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2012_11/why_are_the_democrats_underrep041272.php">the best post I have read so far on the topic</a> by Kathleen Geier.  Just go read it before reading my comment below.</p>
<p>Of course I have my usual comments:</p>
<p>Thank you Kathleen Geier  for your excellent post based on good shoe leather (OK leather ear to the phone) reporting.  I should also thank the political scientists who have been doing their job while I pretend to do it commenting on blogs (I&#8217;m supposed to be an economist).</p>
<p>But (of course there is a but) in those comments I have been stressing that bipartisan and court-drawn maps systematically cause Republicans to win a larger fraction of seats than votes.  The reason is that a bipartisan and court (except sometimes the Supremes) principal is that the House should look like the country and not like the White plus some brown and no black at all Senate.  There is an absolutely deliberate effort to create majority minority districts.  Those districts are overwhelmingly Democratic districts.  The intent isn&#8217;t partisan, but the effect is to cause Republicans to be over represented.  I add that I support the effort to make the House look like the country and not like the Senate.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Also, while I see why incumbency helps the party with more seats I do not at all find an explanation for why it explains the gap between popular vote and seats won.  The advantages of incumbency discussed in the post should cause the party with more incumbents to get more votes, yet they are discussed as if they affect seats won but not vote totals.  To explain the gap, one has to argue that incumbents generally win by narrow margins or lose by wide margins.    <br />Here I think the problem may be with the reported vote totals.  Some states don&#8217;t report votes in races where there is only one candidate on the ballot.  Incumbents often get on the order of 99% of votes or more.  That&#8217;s a lot of wasted votes which would cause the party of incumbents to have a lot of votes per seat won.  But only if they are counted.</p>
<p>Even if the votes are counted, they may be few.  Some people (definitely including me) are irritated when invited to vote for the only candidate on the ballot (if I wanted to live in the USSR I would have moved there back when it existed).  For decades I chose Michael Capuano over write in, but I&#8217;m sure lots of other people left the oval empty out of irritation (this year I actually got to vote in a contested congressional election for the first time since hmmm voting for O&#8217;Neill over Abt in 1982 IIRC).  I think some correction for races with only one candidate on the ballot is needed.</p>
<p>Finally I don&#8217;t get this bit about fewer people in red districts.  What geographic boundaries are being considered ?  I can see how the requirement that each state have 1 representative could in theory create a small population at large district.  However, I think it doesn&#8217;t as even Wyoming is not an unusually small district.  I don&#8217;t see why representation of low population states would be rounded up more often than down.  If the boundaries are, say, county boundaries, then current redistricting does not respect them (I vote in the same county and a different district).  I tend to suspect that the random districting which respects geographic boundaries doesn&#8217;t correspond to anything but a silly modeling assumption.<br />    <br />Polite conclusion about how this is a great post and political scientists are awesome.</p>

                                <p>by Robert Waldmann   </p>
<p>What has Nate Silver done for us lately ?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t really about Nate Silver.  It is about poll aggregators in general and just as much about the Huffington Post pollster, Real Clear Politics and Talking points Memo as about Silver, Wang Linzer and others who try to estimate outcome probabilities and not just average polls.</p>
<p>I think that aggregators have proven that it is better to look at their aggregates than to look at individual polls and try to see patterns or calculate averages from memory.  I think this means that their judgement to not include a poll would be damaging to the pollster.  I conclude that, if they work together, they can demand and obtain transparency. </p>
<p>I have a real problem with what I perceive to be a lack of transparency of pollsters. I refer really to the methodological explanations they have on their web sites.  I do not have the impression that I could reproduce their numbers from the transcripts of their interviews based on their explanations.  I do not think this is acceptable.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>My sense is that this is not just my ignorance &#8212; that pollster methodology is partly secret.  Here I stress that I might be wrong &#8212; it might be that the full protocol is not secret and I am just ignorant.</p>
<p>My understanding is that pollsters keep their methodology partly secret claiming it is a trade secret &#8212; that since they are the best pollster, all other pollsters would imitate their methods if they weren&#8217;t kept secret.  If they do make this claim, it is BS.  They make different choices and each is, as noted, convinced they are right. My guess is that they don&#8217;t describe the assumptions they make, because if they did then people would understand that the assumptions are assumptions and make a difference.  I think that, most unfortunately, most poll consumers are willing to accept a black box, buy a pig in a poke (and mix metaphors).</p>
<p>I think this is not a healthy attitude and that poll consumers including journalists should have a rule that no special sauce is allowed.  I have no hope that journalists will adopt this rule.  But I really hope that poll aggregaters do.</p>
<p>I note that academic journals have this rule.  They demand the raw data and an explanation of calculations such that they can be replicated by editors (doesn&#8217;t mean they do replicate them and doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t ). This is actually a fairly new development.  Editors of academic journals can impose such rules as their decisions are very important &#8212; basically research doesn&#8217;t count without their approval. </p>
<p>I think a conference of leading poll aggregators would be useful and that a decision that polls with secret methodologies are to be ignored would make a huge difference.  But I don&#8217;t think their power to impose transparency on pollsters will last.  Right now they have high status, because they totally out predicted the non quantitative go with their gut pundits.  I&#8217;m pretty sure that in 6 months the fact that they nailed 2012 will be old news which can be ignored.</p>

                                <p>Lifting some more from Angry Bear Robert Waldmann&#8217;s more personal musings at <i>Stochastic thoughts</i>:</p>
<p>Friday, November 02, 2012<br />I know I will regret this. I&#8217;m not drunk enough to do this yet (8:54 PM)<br />Now I am (9:30 PM)</p>
<p>If not specified I predict that the same caucus will keep the Senate seat (so for Connecticut the Democratic Caucus not the Connecticut for Lieberman party)</p>
<p>Senate</p>
<p>Maine&#8230;             King (I) who will caucus with Democrats<br />Massachusetts&#8230;Warren (D)<br />Virginia&#8230;           Kaine (D)<br />Florida &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Nelson (D)<br />Indiana &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Donnelly (D)<br />Missouri&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; McCaskill (D)<br />Wisconsin &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Baldwin (D)<br />Nebraska &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Fischer (R)<br />N Dakota &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Berg (R)<br />Montana &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;Rehberg (R)<br />Arizona &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Carmona (D)<br />Nevada &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..Heller (R)</p>
<p>Mostly I just predict the candidate who is ahead in the average poll will win.  For 6 races this margin is tiny and I think:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Virginia:  Some averages show this closer than close.  An important reason is a Roanoke College poll which shows Allen (R) up by 5.  Roanoke doesn&#8217;t poll outside of Virginia and doesn&#8217;t have much of a track record. Their numbers bounce around a lot.  I guess that they don&#8217;t do much demographic weighting so the sampling error is equal to the stated sampling error (most pollsters weight to make their sample of adults match census data on some dimensions reducing sampling error then ignore this when making cautious estimates of standard errors).  So I weight them less nudging Kaine into a lead. </p>
<p>In Wisconsin again the averages are very close with Baldwin very slightly ahead.   There are some pollsters which I suspect of overestimating Republican vote (Wenzel Strategies and Rasmussen).  This is enough to make me guess that she will slightly outperform the average poll which implies Senator Baldwin.</p>
<p>N Dakota is very close.  Without looking at polls I would guess a Republican is more likely to win.  The basically tied polling doesn&#8217;t move my posterior appreciably from this prior.</p>
<p>Montana is very close.  In spite of my gross error in 2004, I still have some sense that undecideds break against the incumbent (Tester (D)).  Also many polls name the libertarian.  I think slightly more people say they will vote for a no hope of winning third party candidate than actually throw their votes away and I assume that their second choice is Rehberg. </p>
<p>Carmona is slightly behind in Arizona.  I am counting on Hispanic citizens who are even more reluctant to talk to pollsters in English than to vote.</p>
<p>Nevada is close too, but not close enough for me to bet on the hard to poll Hispanics effect and the strength of trade unions and Democratic turn out the vote efforts.</p>
<p>New Senate guess is same as the old Senate with 51 Democrats 2 independents and 47 Republicans. </p>
<p>Update: ooops that&#8217;s embarrassing.  New Senate guess Democrats gain one with 52 Democrats 2 independents and 46 Republicans.  I see I agree with Nate Silver except on Indiana and Arizona.  I am quite confident about Indiana.  Silver&#8217;s model doesn&#8217;t consider whether there has been a big event like a candidate saying rape babies are gifts from God.  So the Howie DePauwe poll showing Donnelly ahead by 11 is just tossed in the smoothed average.  I am not at all confident about Arizona (or for that matter Montana where Silver gives Tester (D) a 33% chance).<br />/update</p>
<p>Sanders  will remain a more reliable Democrat than any Democrat.  King will cause the caucus about as much heart ache as Lieberman.    If my guesses are right, the Democratic caucus will move left with conservadem Ben Nelson gone, centrists Conrad and Tester gone, liberal Warren added, and mainstream Democrats added (2 replacing outgoing mainstream Democrats).  The Republican caucus would move to the right with moderate Snowe sometimes pseudo moderate Brown and not as extreme as Cruz anyway Hutchison gone.  So I guess the Senate will be less harmonious and more partisan hard as that is to imagine.</p>
<p>Warning.  My predictions are almost always wrong (my 2010 Senate predictions were correct).</p>
