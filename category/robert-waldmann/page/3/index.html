                                <p>Lifted from Robert&#8217;s thoughts:</p>
<p>by <strong>Robert Waldmann</strong></p>
<p><strong>Polls and reporting</strong></p>
<p>It is clear that, whenever respected non-partisan media adopt rigid rules, Republicans abuse those rules. The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth are a very clear example. Since news organizations often present both sides of a debate without fact checking in each article, it is possible for a mass of lies to balance all available documentary evidence. Something similar is happening this year. New polling organizations are appearing and making Rasmussen look like less of an outlier. </p>
<p>A new mechanical approach to covering polls is to present an average of recent polls or a time weighted average of polls or to do what Nate Silver does which he explains very clearly (and which works). It is universally believed by politicians and their campaign staff that a poll which would be good news for a candidate if accurate is helpful to the candidate. This means that an effort to game the new poll averaging system will be based on polls which show higher support than in the population for the candidate the pollster wants to support. </p>
<p>It is obvious that unscrupulous operators are doing this. I have long believed that Rasmussen doesn&#8217;t do a terrible job just because they value quantity not quality. The basic problem (says Silver) is that they poll all in one day. This means that they don&#8217;t call back day after day if no one answers the phone, which means that they oversample people who are home a lot. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />There is no doubt that Scott Rasmussen is a very partisan Republican. Rasmussen carefully removes noise without removing bias. They weight by self reported party affiliation. This keeps the numbers from their sloppy swift polls from bouncing around. But they weight using the average party affiliation from Rasmussen polls in the preceding month. This doesn&#8217;t remove any oversampling of Republicans which is undoubtedly there. They could weight using the proportions from polls by reputable pollsters. They chose not to. This is a deliberate effort to bias the results. <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/06/when-house-effects-become-bias/">they had an estimated bias of 3.8% in 2010.</a> </p>
<p>The cost to Rasmussen of their <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/04/rasmussen-polls-were-biased-and-inaccurate-quinnipiac-surveyusa-performed-strongly/?gwh=FD4EE18353C318685A9CC18AC51DD007">demonstrated bias</a> has been less than zero. Liberals ignore them, but Fox News loves them. (In passing, Silver stresses that he is using &#8220;bias&#8221; as a statistical term and not arguing that the Rasmussen bias is due to partisanship. In contrast, I assert that it is. This is not just because the estimated statistical bias fits Scott Rasmussen&#8217;s ideology and party affiliation. It is for the reason given above. There is no legitimate reason to use only old Rasmussen polls to get the proportions of Democrats, Republicans and independents to weight new Rasmussen polls.</p>
<p>I am absolutely sure that Rasmussen does this to generate results pleasing to Scott Rasmussen. I think that the success of this deliberate fraud has earned him emulators. A problem for fraudsters like Scott Rasmussen is that they stand out making their bias obvious. This problem can be solved at modest cost by setting up say 3 other Republican biased pollsters. Poll aggregators are unwilling to exclude pollsters based on their subjective judgment. That means they can be lead wherever the unscrupulous want to lead them. Nate Silver <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/08/20/aug-20-when-the-polling-gets-weird/">explains this too</a></p>
<blockquote><p>But once in a great while, a poll comes along with methodology that is so implausible that it deserves some further comment. The Foster McCollum White Baydoun poll of Florida is one such survey.</p></blockquote>
<p>[skip]  <br />
<blockquote>For instance, we have our house effects adjustment, which corrects for most of these tendencies. Based on this poll, and a prior survey the firm conducted in Michigan, we calculate the firm’s house effect as leaning Republican by roughly 11 percentage points relative to the overall consensus. We do not subtract out the entire 11-point house effect from the polling firm’s results — the model allows polling firms to retain some of their house effect — but the model does adjust the poll substantially, treating it as about a 7-point lead for Mr. Romney rather than a 15-point one. That’s still a very good number for Mr. Romney — enough to make him a slight favorite in our forecast for the state — but at least a little bit more reasonable relative to common sense. Is there argument for just throwing the poll out? In this case, perhaps. But as I said, I’d rather design a system where we have to make fewer of those judgment calls and err on the side of inclusivity. Our threshold for calling out a poll’s technique as being dubious, as we have here, is pretty high — but our threshold for actually throwing a poll out is higher.</p></blockquote>
<p>Silver is by far the most sophisticated aggregator published by mass media. He notes that outrageous nonsense which is pro-Romney by 11 points compared to the average of other pollsters only counts as if it were pro-Romney by 7 points. I think the 11 point estimated house effect is a new record. I don&#8217;t like to make predictions, but I am willing to predict that it will be surpassed. The other plainly biased pollsters are <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/06/26/1103275/--We-Ask-America-pollster-is-a-joke">&#8220;We Ask America&#8221;</a> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_Manufacturers'_Association">which belongs to a business lobby</a>) and &#8220;Purple Strategies&#8221; whose CEO is the notorious <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Castellanos">Alex &#8220;hands&#8221; Castellanos</a> one of the vilest partisan operatives in the business.</p>

                                <p>Lifted from Robert&#8217;s Stochaistic thoughts is a post that comments on Italian political/economists and government policy.  There are some &#8216;in the know&#8217; names for US readers:</p>
<p>Simon Wren-Lewis <a href="http://mainlymacro.blogspot.it/2012/08/why-do-european-economists-write.html">asks</a>. I answer. In real authentic East of the English Channel Europe, economists don&#8217;t endorse candidates, because elections don&#8217;t matter.<br />      <br />Neither do they endorse gymnasts, because our Democracy is about as decorative as the Olympics. </p>
<p>Quick pop quiz explain the policy differences between the Berlusconi government and the Center left governments ? If your answer is that Berlusconi&#8217;s governments try to eliminate the independence of the magistratura (judiciary plus prosecutors) I say &#8220;Bicamerale.&#8221; If your answer is that Berlusconi will ignore any law and any court rather than take frequencies from Berlusconi I say &#8220;La Sette.&#8221; If you argue that Seniore Bunga Bunga has no respect for fiscal restraint or rectitude, I say Tremonti.</p>
<p>The fact is that Italian public policy has been based on the twin principles that the very rich are above the law and that budgets must be (roughly) balanced, since I arrived here in 1989 (or at least since 1992). There was, in theory, an historic election (the second in a row) in 1996 when the new majority included the Communists (not just the ex Communists but the proudly still Communists). It was so radical that the budget was communicated to the cabinet responsible to this majority a few days before they made it public. It was written by civil servants at the Treasury Ministry and included no significant changes.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Wren-Lewis knows how to identify the policy making establishment in Europe (also including the UK). He notes that the establishment is New Keynesian because central banks use New Keynesian models. Note that he doesn&#8217;t claim that candidates for elective office use such models. Because they don&#8217;t matter much.     <br />OK. over there (West of the Channel) the last election made a difference. Also maybe maybe it will matter that for the first time in human history that French Socialists have a President and an absolute majority in both houses of Parliament (not that the Communists held Mitterand back much &#8212; but that was long ago).<br />    <br />I think that over in the USA the very serious villager consensus is powerful. But over here it is just about everything. Sacrificing one&#8217;s reputation in order to have a tiny possible effect on an election is absurd here. European economists don&#8217;t do anything that disreputable, because policy influence is based on reputation and not anything done by vulgar voters.</p>
<p>This has its advantages. Europe doesn&#8217;t dive into huge unnecessary deficits because of an election. Policy doesn&#8217;t depend on butterfly ballots and hanging chads. </p>
<p>But the second recession in 4 years hitting before 2008 real GDP is surpassed has no noticeable effect on the policy debate either. </p>
<p>It was decided in the 1990s that reducing budget deficits was, is, and always will be the paramount aim of public policy. </p>
<p>Democracy is messy, but a sober, disciplined well ordered march over a cliff isn&#8217;t ideal either.</p>

<p>Bill Nothstine · Top Commenter · Living Liberally</p>
<p>And, to be fair to Romney [brief interlude while Bill clutches frantically, Strangelove-like, at the hand that just typed those words], if he said it on TV that can be considered at least prima facie evidence that he doesn&#8217;t believe a word of it.</p></blockquote>
<p>and<br />
<blockquote>Daniel Denvir just hit the jackpot with a real live Atrios link. I assume that he quotes accurately. If so, I think he has chosen <a href="http://www.citypaper.net/blogs/nakedcity/Daily-News-and-Scranton-Times-Tribune-refer-to-white-supremacists-as-white-peoples-rights-group.html?reg=y">an excellent way to build a journalism career</a>(just ask big media Matt, Glenn Greenwald and Jane Hamsher). Also, again assuming accuracy, it would seem to me that Karen Testa, East Region Editor at the AP has chosen an extremely efficient way to destroy one.<br />
<blockquote>“What possible purpose would there be for me to send you this story when you&#8217;re trying to cause trouble for how it was written?” said an angry Karen Testa, East Region Editor at the AP. Before hanging up, she added: “That&#8217;s a good way to build a journalism career.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep that&#8217;s journalism all right, based on the idea that no possible purpose is served by people who cause trouble for powerful organizations.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Mitt Romney proposes reducing tax brackets by 20% and cutting the estate tax (to zero IIRC).  He will keep or expand favored treatment of capital gains and dividends. He claims that he doesn&#8217;t plan to cut taxes for the rich.  He claims that he will avoid such cuts by eliminating deductions, credits and exclusions.  One of his claims must be false as they are arithmentically inconsistent.</p>
<p>update:  Beyond parody.  Romney aid Lanhee Chen says that the Tax Policy Center conclusion that Romney&#8217;s proposal is gives to the rich is &#8220;biased&#8221; because it ignores Romney&#8217;s proposed corporate income tax cuts</p>
<p>“The study analyzes only half of Governor Romney’s tax program, ignoring the reforms that would make America’s corporations more competitive by moving from the highest corporate tax rate in the industrialized world to one that is comparable to our trading partners.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yep that&#8217;s the way to convince the public.  Note that, in addition to tax cuts for rich people, there are tax cuts for corporations.  Importantly Chen does not deny that Romney lied when he said he didn&#8217;t seek tax cuts for the rich.  Chen&#8217;s line is the usual supply side trickle down line that tax cuts for the rich and for corporations will help the non rich by causing greater growth.  I know of no evidence which supports this claim.</p>
<p>I almost feel sorry for the Romney campaign.</p>
<p><a href="http://maddowblog.msnbc.com/_news/2012/08/01/13077416-links-for-the-81-trms?lite">In other breaking news (from 2002) Romney claimed he was resident in Utah in 1999 and 2000 before he claimed he was resident in Massachusetts in 1999 and 2000.</a></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t keep track of his lies (hell Steve Benen has trouble).  Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier to keep track of his non-lies ?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.brookings.edu/research/papers/2012/08/01-tax-reform-brown-gale-looney">A new report</a> from the Brookings Institution and the Tax Policy Center includes the following.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>The key intuition behind our central result is that, because the total value of the available tax expenditures (once tax expenditures for capital income are excluded) going to high-income taxpayers is smaller than the tax cuts that would accrue to high-income taxpayers, high-income taxpayers must necessarily face a lower net tax burden. As a result, maintaining revenue neutrality mathematically necessitates a shift in the tax burden of at least $86 billion away from high-income taxpayers onto lower- and middle-income taxpayers. This is true even under the assumption that the maximum amount of revenue possible is obtained from cutting tax expenditures for high-income households.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazingly, even if they accept Greg Mankiw&#8217;s estimates of the effect of rate cuts on growth (which assumes no increase in the deficit even in the short run).  They still conclude that a Romney claim must be false.</p>
<blockquote><p>Nevertheless, even if one were to use the model from Mankiw and Weinzierl (2006) and assume that after five years 15 percent of the $360 billion tax cut is paid for through higher economic growth, the available tax expenditures would still need to be cut by 56 percent; on net lower- and middle-income taxpayers would still need to pay higher taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>This analysis will come as a complete shock to exactly zero Angrybear readers (including the conservatives) but might stimulate discussion in comments.</p>
<p>* Title corrected.  The Tax Policy Center is a joint center of the Brookings Institute and the Urban Institute not a separate entity.</p>

<p>This is part of <a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&#038;sclient=psy-ab&#038;q=ballance+site:rjwaldmann.blogspot.com&#038;oq=ballance+site:rjwaldmann.blogspot.com&#038;gs_l=hp.12...9824.17359.0.18628.37.37.0.0.0.0.161.2506.33j4.37.0...0.0.hHITE8TdWyE&#038;pbx=1&#038;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&#038;fp=b4c92a2d29177826&#038;biw=1299&#038;bih=558">a series</a>.<br />    <br />As usual, I think the latest is the all time winner. The concept of Ballance is that reporting and commentary must reach balanced conclusions no matter what the facts are. It is named after former representative Jack Ballance (see google search above).<br />    <br />I knew it would not be good for my blood pressure to read <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/could-a-truly-honest-politician-become-president/2012/07/06/gJQAGK4OSW_story_1.html">Could a truly honest politician become president?</a> by Kathleen Hall Jamieson, so I avoided it but was brought back by DemFromCt&#8217;s one word answer <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/07/08/1107373/-Abbreviated-Pundit-Round-up-Class-warfare-edition">&#8220;No.&#8221;</a><br />    <br />I have read only the first page and I will read no more. I note that in the all time winning example of the pundit&#8217;s fallacy Jamieson answers her question &#8220;yes&#8221; in spite of providing massive evidence that the answer is no (with a possible exception for someone who couldn&#8217;t lie, knowingly speak a falsehood, because he didn&#8217;t know anything.<br />    <br />But that&#8217;s not my beat. The number one example of Ballance is accusing Barack Obama of dishonesty, because he accurately summarized an article in The Washington Post.<br />    <br />&#8221; The Obama campaign misused a recent Washington Post article to label Romney as an “outsourcer in chief.”&#8221;<br />    <br />Yes the Post blew it and actually reported unballanced facts about which candidate outsourced more. So they must make up for this by complaining that Obama took their remarks out of context. This is pathetic. A disagreement about whether a summary is fair or not is a sign that someone is being dishonest. Anyone with any grasp of ethics at all would understand that a Washington Post columnist can&#8217;t be a fair referee of a debate between the Post and Obama. Anyone who is not determined to be ballanced has to note that the Romney campaign said the Post confused outsoursing and offshoring because they wrote about outsourcing. I note and stress that this blatantly fallacious argument from the Romney campaign is not noted with the complaint about Obama added for Ballance.<br />
<blockquote><a name="more"></a></p></blockquote>
<p>Rather Jaemieson notes nothing wrong with the Romney campaigns response to the Post&#8217;s article. She can&#8217;t as then her first page would be unballanced. Therefore she has to argue that whatever the Obama campaign allegedly did is incomparably worse than introducing a word &#8220;offshoring&#8221; and saying that the Post is wrong because if a word in their article was replaced with that different word, then it would be false. This is like claiming that if one says &#8220;Romney is dishonest&#8221; one is wrong because one has said &#8220;Rommey is honest&#8221; and confused &#8220;dishonest&#8221; and &#8220;honest.&#8221; But that outrage against language truth an logic can&#8217;t be criticized *at all] because it would ruin the ballance.<br />    <br />Jamieson&#8217;s utter inability to honestly address honesty is proven above. One rule (not just at the Post) is that you can&#8217;t say it&#8217;s bad without saying it&#8217;s bad and getting worse. So she must not only present the case that Romney&#8217;s dishonesty dwarfs Obama&#8217;s, but also argue that Obama is less honest than earlier Democratic candidates. So he is dishonest for quoting the Washington Post while Kennedy is honest    <br />&#8220;John F. Kennedy in 1960 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 treated their rivals’ positions and records fairly, forthrightly forecast their governing approaches and hewed to the facts. With the exception of the Democratic attack on the alleged missile gap, which Kennedy may have believed existed, neither the 1960 Democratic nominee nor his Republican counterpart, Richard M. Nixon, distorted his or his opponent’s plans.&#8221;<br />    <br />OK so the fact that Kennedy &#8220;may&#8221; have believed his fals claims means he is fair and honest. The standard for Obama is no one claims to have been taken out of context. The standard for Kennedy is there is no proof beyond reasonable doubt. With utter total contempt for the data, Jamieson has decided (I guess as a methodological a priori) that both sides are roughly equally at fault and that things have gotten worse. So she must say that a false claim of fact on a hugely important issue which &#8220;may have&#8221; been an honest mistake is honest, while an arguable summary of an article is much much worse.    <br />Note also the tricky Dicky exception to Ballance. When discussing the fact Jamieson says Nixon&#8217;s 1960 campaign was basically honest, but somehow he doesn&#8217;t make the list of honest candidates along with Mondale, Kennedy and Reagan.<br />    <br />Just before clicking over here, I begged the internets to compare the honesty of statements made by Romney and Nixon. I am quite sure that candidate Romney has lied vastly vastly more than candidate Nixon did (of course President Nixon lied about whether he was a crook &#8212; but I think his campaign was much more honest than Kennedy 1960 (for whom of course I would have voted) Reagan ever or Obama 2008 (he claimed that he thought no individual mandate was needed).<br />    <br />Now I don&#8217;t want an honest candidate. For me true honesty in a Democratic hopeful true honesty (like Mondale&#8217;s, McGovern&#8217;s or Carter&#8217;s) is a deal breaker. I am not Kant and I think it is sometimes morally right to lie. But all the same, Jamieson&#8217;s total contempt for the facts appalls me.</p>

                                <p>Lifted from Robert&#8217;s Stochastic Thoughts comes this comment on Matt Yglesias: </p>
<p>by Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Matthew Yglesias <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/07/05/does_uncompensated_care_raise_prices_for_the_insured_.html#article_comment_box">asks</a>  (<a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">Does Uncompensated Care Raise Prices for the Insured?)</a><br /><a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766"><br /></a><br />. I am having trouble with moneybox comments so I comment here. OK first I have to note that a philosophy concentrator half my age is doing pretty well to make me think about economics. Yglesias&#8217;s willingness to think and write about technical subjects is a valuable national resource. This is also true of field specialists can respond to his arguments.   <br />His argument<br />
<blockquote>Think about the CVS downstairs from my office. It charges prices that it believes are profit-maximizing. Now suppose some indigent person comes in and burns all the magazines on their magazine rack for fun. The guy&#8217;s got no money, so CVS can&#8217;t recoup its losses. Does this force CVS to raise prices on Diet Coke to make up for the cost? No—CVS was already charging profit-maximizing prices, and past losses are irrelevant to determining optimal forward-looking pricing strategy.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Hmm logically this implies that people who live in high crime neighborhoods in which people do stuff like that don&#8217;t pay more for goods. But they do. So what is missing ?<br />    <br />Well first the thought experiment considers an unanticipateable cost and one repetition of which is not likely. Uncompensated health care isn&#8217;t like that at all.<br />    <br />Even a totally profit oriented for profit hospital chain will consider the forecast rate of unconmpensated care when deciding whether to invest in building new hospitals. A cost which doesn&#8217;t affect the marginal cost of a good or service and doesn&#8217;t in itself effect the elasticity of demand will affect entry, which depends on forecast average cost and not on marginal cost.<br />    <br />This will affect prices. The reason is that with higher unavoidable costs a higher ratio of price to marginal cost is required to convinced firms to enter.<br />    <br />Let&#8217;s imagine a socially useful application of Yglesias&#8217;s theory (if it were valid). Stealing from CVS and giving the the stolen goods to the median citizen would be a distortion free transfer from CVS shareholders to people on average poorer than CVS shareholders. This would cause increased welfare. I don&#8217;t think Yglesias thinks this would be a good approach.<br />    <br />I don&#8217;t think he thought the problem through to the end (oops I mean to the beginning &#8212; entry of firms).</p>

                                <p>lifted from Robert&#8217;s site:</p>
<p>Katherine Eban <a href="http://features.blogs.fortune.cnn.com/2012/06/27/fast-and-furious-truth/">reported</a> in the notorious left wing rag &#8220;Fortune&#8221; that everything Republicans have been saying about &#8220;Fast and Furious&#8221; up until yesterday when they found Eric Holder for contempt of Congress (for only handing over 7,600 pages of documents and insisting that ongoing investigations are protected by executive privilege) is nonsense.<br />    <br />Senator C. Grassley (or his office) <a href="http://www.grassley.senate.gov/news/Article.cfm?customel_dataPageID_1502=41536">replied.</a><br />    <br />The response from Grassley is a non denial denial. He (or his office) writes that the key issue is that the BATF &#8220;encouraged&#8221; gun sales. The previous line had been that the BATF &#8220;allowed&#8221; gun sales. The original claim is important, since it implies that the BATF could have prevented the gun sales. Grassley (and his office) no longer stick to their previous claim that this has been demonstrated.<br />    <br />I stress that I use the word &#8220;previous&#8221; refers to the previous sentence. In one sentence Grassley (or his office) asserts that the claim that the BATF could not stop the guns is inconsistent with the evidence. In the following sentence he (or they) argue in the alternative that it doesn&#8217;t matter if the BATF could or couldn&#8217;t stop the trafficking.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>The central claim of the article, that there was nothing ATF could have done to stop the illegal sales, is simply incompatible with the evidence. If it is true that ATF could not interdict and seize weapons due to legal hurdles beyond its control,</p></blockquote>
<p>I believe that&#8217;s called arguing in the alternative. Something defence attorneys can do, but prosecutors better not. Don&#8217;t you think that after months of investigation Grassley (and his staff) should know if the BATF can or can&#8217;t stop gun sales ? Yet he (or they) claim no knowledge of relevant law and make no assertions one way or the other about legal advice from the US Attorney&#8217;s office (which is notably part of the same Justice Department so they can harass Holder over that instead).  </p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/poll-most-believe-the-rich-arent-taxed-enough-but-their-ranks-are-shrinking/2012/04/20/gIQASZpbVT_blog.html">Suzy Khimm</a>, Kevin Drum and <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/happy-hour-roundup/2012/04/20/gIQA7BKUWT_blog.html">Greg Sargent</a> comment on the series of gallup polls dating back to 1992 in which a solid majority of US adults, ranging from 55% to 77%, say that they think the rich pay less than their fair share of taxes.  Please click <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/04/fighting-back-against-republican-message-machine">the link to Drum</a> then come back. I don&#8217;t want to excerpt.   Oddly the fact stressed by Drum (and the only fact noted by Sargent) is the modest decline in this fraction from 77% to 62%since 1992 not the fact that a major party is totally dedicated to reducing taxes which a solid majority think are too low already.  Khim is just describing the data.  Drum has a long history of warning liberals not to trust the polls which seem to show our countrypeople are liberal (search for &#8220;polling literalism&#8221;) and a long record of not knowing about, then downplaying the exact polls under discussion.</p>
<p>The change from 1992 to the present came in two or three phases.  The third possible phase (stressed by Drum) was an increase from 55% in 2010 to 62% in 2012.  I&#8217;m not convinced that anything really changed.  I think the 2010 sample just happened to be unusual, since other polls from around then show support of 60% or more for higher taxes on the rich.  I won&#8217;t discuss this further.  If we ignore the 2010 poll, we see a decline from 68% in 1994 to 62% in 2012.  The null that this decline is entirely due to sampling error is rejected at the 5% level,  the standard deviation of the difference due to sampling error is on the order of [root(2*(1/3)*(2/3)/1000)]100% or about 2.5%.  But a change (or difference) of 8% is not usually considered worthy of much discussion.   There was also a statistically significant change from 77% in 1992 to 68% in 1994.  In this case, I do not suspect the 1992 sample as the extreme number is confirmed by something Brad DeLong said in 1994 about internal Clinton Gore 1992 polling.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I have three problems with Drum&#8217;s analysis.  First he keeps arguing that US public support for more progressive taxes is low or not high enough or not as high as it was.  This is of limited interest to readers.  Projecting, I think he is being stubborn.  Also, he seems to equate &#8220;not high enough to get the job done&#8221; with &#8220;not high&#8221; ignoring the huge gap between public and elite opinion on the issue (and the gap between public opinion and elite opinion about public opinion).  Among the elite, it is widely agreed that lower tax rates are better and rates much higher than Clinton era rates are unimaginable.    The fact which makes me lose my temper (which I am trying to keep now) is that the elite ascribes this view to the general public, asserting without evidence that Americans oppose taxation much more progressive than current taxation considering it class warfare.</p>
<p>Another more useful complaint is to note the tendency to look at trends and ignore levels.  62% support for something is lower, but it is not low.  This temptation is understandable as trends are easy to see without defining units.  But it isn&#8217;t optimal.</p>
<p>Finally, there is a tendency to assume that things were normal back at the beginning of the time series.  OK this is the second complaint re warmed, but in 1992 US public opinion about whether the rich were paying their fair share was not ordinary at all.  That level is not discussed by any of the three bloggers.  The discussion of the difference between the current level and that level is discussed only in terms of factors which increase the current level.  This is an aspect of the general tendency to tread trends as if they were levels, but 1992 opinion on the question was extraordinary.</p>
<p>Again I trust my memory of what Brad DeLong told me 18 years about about internal polls which were 2 years old at that time.  He claimed that Clinton&#8217;s pollster got so tired of solid majorities answering yes when asked if rich peoples&#8217; taxes should be raised in order to reduce the deficit, spend more on education, spend more on this that or the other thing that, finally, he asked if people thought rich peoples&#8217; taxes should be raised to finance more waste fraud and abuse – and a plurality answered yes.</p>
<p>Also I absolutely trust my memory of the discussion of focus group reaction to a debate between Bush and Clinton.  They had Bush supporters, Clinton supporters and undecided voters watching with those dial things which allow people to indicate agreement or disagreement.  When Clinton said something to the effect that &#8220;only the rich have gotten tax cuts&#8221; self identified Bush supporters (on average) dialed in agreement.  The TV commentators noted that this was very rare.  I&#8217;ve never heard of such a thing.</p>
<p>In 1992, a solid majority US public was very angry that the rich weren&#8217;t  paying what that majority considered considered to be a fair share of taxes.   A known Philanderer from Arkansas was elected President replacing the man who lead the US and more allies than the US had ever had before to victory.  That burning desire for some class war was very nice, but we can perfectly well make do with rather less.</p>
<p>I think the key thing is to deliver on the promise of tax cuts for the non rich as Obama did and Clinton didn&#8217;t.  Of course, the vast majority don&#8217;t know that Obama kept his promise, but anger over his failure to keep the promise is much diminished by the fact that he kept it.  Commentators couldn&#8217;t stop talking about how Clinton hadn&#8217;t kept his word.  They don&#8217;t want to display ignorance by claiming that Obama didn&#8217;t, so they avoid the topic.  This could be enough.</p>

<p>Coincidentally commenter Luis Enrique asked me what I thought of that paper on Gmail. </p>
<blockquote><p>this is commentator Luis Enrique [skip] I am enjoying your to and fro with Simon WL anyway, I just wanted to send you <a href="http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2012/04/forecasting-the-great-recession-dsge-vs-blue-chip.html">this link</a>, in case these guys are not on your RSS, as a continuation of sorts of your post on the Vox paper on the same topic</p></blockquote>
<p>My thoughts after the jump.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t actually have an RSS and, as I admit from time to time, don&#8217;t generally read the economics literature, so it was new to me.</p>
<p>The key part of the NY Fed post is the figures most of which simply show that both the models and the blue chip forecasters failed to forecast the great recession.  These are forecasts of quarterly GDP growth.  The explicit model based forecasts are red, the average of Blue Chip professional forecaster forecasts is green.  Blue indicates confidence intervals for the explicit model based forecasts.  Click one of the links for actually legible decently sized figures.
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E9mcSJMg7Jk/T4ycpvXfpJI/AAAAAAAAAJY/wAtCHiatRBw/s1600/Cattura.PNG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E9mcSJMg7Jk/T4ycpvXfpJI/AAAAAAAAAJY/wAtCHiatRBw/s320/Cattura.PNG" width="262"></a></div>
<p>I think the key passage in the explanatory text is</p>
<p>
<blockquote>The chart shows the forecasts for three different DSGE specifications. We call the first one SWπ; this is essentially the popular Smets-Wouters model. The second is the Smets-Wouters model with financial frictions, as in Bernanke et al. and Christiano et al., which we call SWπ-FF. The other difference between this model and SWπ is the use of observations on the Baa-ten-year Treasury rate spread, which captures distress in financial markets.<br />The last specification is still the SWπ-FF, except that we use observations for the federal funds rate and spreads for the quarter that just ended and for which no National Income and Product Accounts data are yet available (for the January 10, 2009, forecasts, these would be the 2008:Q4 average fed funds rate and spreads). </p></blockquote>
<p>The DSGE models which do a bit better aren&#8217;t DSGE models. The Baa-Treasury spread is added as an explanatory variable without any discussion of micro foundations. The text makes it clear that this variable is added in addition to the frictions considered by Bernanke et al and Christiano et al.  Bernanke et al have the difference between a risky and risk free rate as an endogenous variable &#8212; it should depend only on the ratio of equity to the capital stock (IIRC).  It isn&#8217;t a free variable in that model and can&#8217;t be added in addition to the frictions considered by Bernanke et al.</p>
<p>I claim that the model which does poorly rather than terribly is an ad hoc aggregate model without micro foundations.</p>
<p>The outcome on the graph is not the BEA&#8217;s current estimate (-8% at an annual rate for 2008:Q4). This means that the outcome as re-estimated months before the publication date of the post is well outside of the 90% confidence interval except for the last panel which shows an ad hoc model using contemporary data.</p>
<p>Why no forecasts using data from the trough ? There is no evidence in the post that the DSGE model had any success forecasting the recovery. There are no forecasts which use 2008:Q4 BEA estimates flash, advanced or &#8220;final&#8221; (but not really final since they were corrected in 2011).</p>
<p>The good looking figure adds another variable ad hoc. Oddly it just happens to track the GDP growth rate very well in this episode.  It would not have a similar coefficient if estimated with more data &#8212; the spread has not been close to what it was in 2008-9 since 1962 (when the FRED 10 year constant maturity Treasury series I looked at started) but GDP shrank at the same rate in a quarter in 1980 as in 2008:Q8.  The past 5 years shows why adding the spread as an explanatory variable (even lagged one quarter) helps a lot.  In the figure I didn&#8217;t lag the spread as I should have and would have if I could have with FRED.  Even so, the peak is a bit to the right of the trough of GDP growth.  But the point is that even shifted to the right one quarter (to lag) the Baa &#8211; Treasury spread&#8217;s high level and rapid decline fits the steep decline in GDP in 2009:Q1 and then the rapid recovery.</p>

                                <p>(Dan here&#8230;Lifted from<strong> Robert&#8217;s Stochastic Thoughts.</strong>  Just a comment.)</p>
<p>by<strong> Robert Waldmann</strong></p>
<p><strong>Most absurd use of &#8220;Most&#8221;</strong></p>
<p> Two of the bees in my bonnet are the www.WashingtonPost.com Headline writer(s) and the abuse of the word &#8220;most.&#8221; In a bit of a shift*, I complain about the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">www.nytimes.com</a> headline:<br />  </p>
<p><a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/n/newyorktimes-poll-watch/index.html">&#8220;Most Americans Oppose Health Law, Poll Finds&#8221;</a></p>
<p>I clicked the link and read &#8220;In the latest poll, 47 percent said they oppose the law while 36 percent approve, with the rest having no opinion. &#8220;<br />  <br />OK lets go slow. 47<50 therefore 47%<50% 47% is not most. <br />I don&#8217;t like the word most because it ambiguously means &#8220;more than half&#8221; and &#8220;approximately all.&#8221; It is a 4 letter automatic equivocation.</p>
<p>I add that the article has changed since the first time I read it (the New York times has always updated within the day &#8212; the newspaper of record becomes the record at midnight). In the older draft (trust me) the 47% = most was in the first paragraph.</p>
<p>Interestingly the new first paragraph notes that two thirds of respondents want the Supreme Court to declare parts of the law (mostly the mandate I guess) unconstitutional. This shows how much the US pubic hates judicial activism. Think of how few must have the view that laws which they don&#8217;t like shouldn&#8217;t be overturned by unelected courts.</p>
