                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The 2012 Presidential is so close just so close that not only do different polls show different results but different averages of polls do.</p>
<p>OK it is clear that extremely fancy models such as the fivethirtyeight model which attempt to assign undecideds and use state data to estimate the national vote and vice versa are different (generally I don&#8217;t like fancy but Nate Silver has a track record).  But simple smoothers also give different results.</p>
<p>Partly it is the choice of polls to include yes/no on web based or partisan polls.  www.realclearpolitics.com is a simple average but they don&#8217;t include partisan polls or web based polls (and use self reported partisanship so Rasmussen is included but not PPP ooops).</p>
<p>But part of it is the smoothing algorithm.  both http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com and <a href="http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster">http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster</a> use loess smoothers which fit a constant and a coefficient on time using weights which decline away from time t and report the fitted value for t.  I think this means they are too quick to extrapolate trends.  This means that one outlier can convince the computer that the polls have been trending for a candidate.</p>
<p>My example the odd case of TalkingPointsMemo and Michigan.  The program has Ohio leans Obama and Michigan a tossup.  This is due to one poll by Foster-McCallum (in serious contention for the bitterly fought prize for worst pollster).  Without them, the computer estimates that Obama is 3.9% ahead.  That is enough for TPM to call the state leans Obama and give more than 269 electoral votes in Obama leaning states.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Here is the graph with Foster-McCallum
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JntFLjccpOY/UI15PucqbGI/AAAAAAAAATc/Z7xJx1TAYSc/s1600/TPMdumb.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="176" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JntFLjccpOY/UI15PucqbGI/AAAAAAAAATc/Z7xJx1TAYSc/s320/TPMdumb.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<p>Here is the graph without them</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wRaTnX5B4JM/UI14lWwIJoI/AAAAAAAAATU/W7MWkGF0D5g/s1600/TPMselected.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="160" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wRaTnX5B4JM/UI14lWwIJoI/AAAAAAAAATU/W7MWkGF0D5g/s320/TPMselected.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<p>This is extreme, because Foster/McCallum had a Florida poll with an absurd sample which earned the coveted and very rare double asterix from TPM for not included in the average because of an editorial decision.</p>
<p>I think such decisions should be made pollster by pollster not poll by poll.  But totally aside from that a sensible smoothing algorithm shouldn&#8217;t be so sensitive to one poll when 10 October polls are available all of which polled after the first TV debate.</p>
<p>Notice how the poll pulls down estimates of the state of the race before it&#8217;s sample began.  This feature of the smoother makes it hard to see if a shift is due to an event.</p>
<p>I say even simpler is better than Loess.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cjr.org/swing_states_project/the_misleading_momentum_narrative.php?page=all">Brendan Nyhan autopsies the mittmentum narrative here.</a>    </p>
<p>I comment.   </p>
<p>Thank you for this very good post.  I had been puzzled by the &#8220;bad narrative about momentum&#8221; narrative on progressive blogs (largely because I interact with the rest of humanity largely by reading progressive blogs).  You demonstrate that there was indeed a mittmentum narrative.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to add some thoughts.  First, aside from the general tendency to seek facts which confirm the story we want to tell, people have huge amounts of trouble with time series which have no momentum.  This has been demonstrated by psychologists.</p>
<p>The experiment is to show people a random walk &#8212; a time series in which the changes are uncorrelated so the best forecast of where it will end up is always exactly the current level.  Subjects just can&#8217;t resist perceiving mean reversion or  momentum. These are opposite.  Mean reversion is called &#8220;a bounce&#8221; in the campaign literature.  The idea is that a recent change shall partly fade away and things will go back to the way they were.    So immediately after the first debate, there was much discussion of whether Romney&#8217;s gains were a bounce &#8212; destined to vanish.  Momentum is the opposite, people see a trend and extrapolate it so they think a shift will not just last but grow stronger over time.  Basically people always see one or the other when they are shown data with neither.<br />  <br /><a name="more"></a>  <br />These opposite errors are linked.  The idea that a random series of changes shouldn&#8217;t move in the same direction for a while (so changes are perceived as bounce) makes people think something funny is going on when they happen to be in the same direction for a while (we see a new trend).   Notably, since polls contain sampling error which is independent across polls, polling averages contain independent changes and give the sort of series which we just can&#8217;t mentally accept.</p>
<p>Tracking polls make things trickier still.  Because they are moving averages, the will have trends even if overall public opinion doesn&#8217;t.  Say the Gallup poll will tend to move in the same direction for a week, because it is a weekly moving average.  It is psychologically hard to see something trend for a week and not extrapolate the trend.  This is true even if one knows that the data are a weekly moving average.    <br />I don&#8217;t know votamatic (I check Jackman, Talking Points Memo, fivethirtyeight ,and Real Clear Politics uh often).  Jackman and the TPM group add to the problem.  Their smoothed average is LOESS which means they calculate the value for t as follows: estimate a time trend with data with weights which decline for polls further from t then report the fitted value for time t.  this means that they extrapolate trends.  The approach assumes that there is momentum.  Then people extrapolate the trend in the extrapolated trend.    I  have checked and confirmed that dropping a medium old poll with huge Romney &#8211; Obama can cause the current estimate of Romney minus Obama to go *up*.  I try and try to find such cases and have found one or two IIRC think the McLaughlin for Allen Virginia poll was one (the web user clicking buttons experiment depends on what other data are used so can&#8217;t trivially be reproduced using tools at the sites).</p>
<p>There is also just a lag in reporting.  Total webaholic political junkies consider early October ancient history.  The ink, paper and TV reliant not so much.  This post stresses how a 10 day old pattern was noted 3 days after it was confidently asserted that there was no such pattern.  7 days  has not always a huge amount of time.</p>
<p>Finally there is spin frankly reported as spin.  A whole lot of the momentum stories quoted (often anonymous) Romney campaign staff claiming they had momentum.  It is just a fact that they made those claims.  Importantly the Obama campaign didn&#8217;t push back (Ezra Klein claims this and he would know).  Reporters just don&#8217;t report that while he said and she said the same thing, the data show something else.   I think many consider reporting the mutually denied facts to be unethical &#8212; they feel they can&#8217;t contest Romney campaign claims more than the Obama campaign does.  Now I have no idea why anyone granted anonymity to flacks pushing the campaign&#8217;s narrative and I don&#8217;t like the he said she said approach.  But it is not the same as perceiving momentum and reporting that there is momentum.   They said Romney flacks said Romney had momentum, because this is just what happened.  We have a problem, but it is not in our common psychology but in the manipulability (sp) of reporting based on   simple rules.<br />    <br />Anyway sorry for the overlong comment on your excellent post.</p>

<p>I have always assumed that Romney must be smart, because of the way in which he acquired great wealth.  Yes he was ruthless and dishonest (the real scandal is what is legal).  But there are lots of greedy ruthless dishonest people and the vast majority are no where near as good at it.</p>
<p>But he&#8217;s campaigning like an idiot. </p>
<p>Affirmative action sometimes puts some people in very uncomfortable situations &#8212; admission to a ruthlessly competitive University based on the assumption that a student&#8217;s potential exceeds academic performance so far (due to say come on being taught at school in Malay-Indonesian  for much of one&#8217;s childhood) puts gigantic pressure on some people.  One reacted by acquiring work habits and self discipline I can&#8217;t even dream of.  </p>
<p>Being sole shareholder chairman of the board of directors CEO and President of a company can put people in a too comfortable position &#8212; surrounded by flatterers and able to settle all debates by authority.  I suspect that this can lead to an erosion of the ability to think critically.  Romney seems to think that he still has the power to settle debates just by saying they are settled.  If so he can&#8217;t campaign or govern.  </p>

<p>How many CEOs have ever gone on to be successful at anything else ?  Unless you define being a CEO as success by definition (as we do) how many have been successful CEOs ?  The only standard of comparison is other CEOs &#8212; if they are generally incompetent because of vanity and lazy brain syndrome how would we know.  Is there any evidence against the wildly speculative hypothesis that  the vast majority have lost their ability to think straight, because of years of flattery</p>

                                <p>Lifted from Robert Waldmann&#8217;s more private thoughts:</p>
<p>I love <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/2012/10/barack-obama/its-not-what-you-say-about-your-issues-its-what-your-issues-say-about-you/#comment-116676">this video</a>.</p>
<p>I agree that it is very odd for Romney to brag about balancing a budget with a 1.5 billion dollar federal bailout. But what exactly does it mean for a manager of a firm to balance a budget ? I’d say the very minimum is to keep the firms you control out of bankruptcy. By this standard Romney is not a budget balancer at all. At Bain he made huge amounts of money relying on limited liability. Several Bain controlled firms went bankrupt. Those were budgets under Romney’s control (sole shareholder CEO and all that) which were as un balanced as budgets can be.</p>
<p>I know I am mixing up budgets and balance sheets. I am doing that to bend over backwards to try to meet Romney half way. Really a corporations budget isn’t balanced if it issues debt. Unbalanced budgets are the key to private equity. Romney’s whole career as a businessman is based on understanding that an obsession with avoiding debt is costly.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>On this he is consistent in practice as well as being consistently dishonest, since as you note, he proposes a huge increase in the US budget deficit. The approach of loading an entity up with debt and not worrying about what happens if it can’t pay has worked very well for him so far, so why shouldn’t he stick with it_<br />I’m very sorry I wrote an outraged comment on your post critiquing #rateloweringbasebroadening (RLBB)for not critiquing it completely enough. In this video you make the key point that extremely high income people will gain money they sure don’t need from RLBB as they just don’t have deductions on the order of their income (importantly this refers to Romney style RL and maybe a bit of BB (but no details) and things are different if the BB includes raising taxes on capital income and capital gains).</p>
<p>On Gas prices, I note that US consumption is a large fraction of world consumption. A US gas tax probably would cause lower petroleum prices in the medium run (not immediately only after people trade in their SUVs for cars). It makes no sense for a country to pretend it is tiny when it is large. Laissez faire is optimal only when price taking is optimal. In the world petroleum market, the US acts as a monopsony which has no interest in maximizing profits. It’s as if Saudi Arabia ignored the effect of their exports on prices. Of course you know this (you praised Mankiw on the gas tax). Fleet economy standards may be a silly way to do it based on the US obsession with low gas prices, but I suspect that Obama’s policies are causing lower petroleum prices and will eventually cause significantly lower petroleum prices. “There is nothing [more] a US President can do” is true given and only given political limits.</p>
<p>(OK so enough being responsible. Now a dumb joke about a smart guy &#8212; a smart Pollack joke<br />Love the denunciation of rate cutting and base broadening.  You are the most effective populist since  President  Jackson, Pollack.)</p>

<p>All aggregators are doing funny things by rounding first then subtracting.  This is a comment on <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/10/12/1143566/-Daily-Kos-Elections-Polling-Wrap-Has-tightening-national-race-changed-path-to-270-electoral-votes#comments">Singiser</a>, but it could be on any aggregator.<br />    <br />In the Gallup Tracker likely voter subsample, Romney<a href="http://polltracker.talkingpointsmemo.com/pollsters/gallup"> is up 1.2% </a> (this link points to numbers which will change)  If one must round one should round to 1 not 2.</p>

<p>The standard report rounds Romney&#8217;s lead up to 2 % .<br />&#8220;NATIONAL (Gallup Tracking): Romney 49, Obama 47 (LV); &#8220;<br />    <br />In the <a href="http://news.investors.com/special-report/508415-ibdtipp-poll.aspx">IBD/Tipp tracker likely voter sample</a>   Obama is up 0.7.  If one must round one should round to 1 not zero.</p>
<p><strong>IBD/TIPP 2012 Presidential Election     <br />Daily Tracking Poll</strong><br /><strong>Day 4: Oct. 12, 2012</strong><br /><strong>Obama: +0.7</strong>Obama 46.4% | Romney 45.7%<br />Read More At IBD: <a href="http://news.investors.com/special-report/508415-ibdtipp-poll.aspx#ixzz2998NIqGc">http://news.investors.com/special-report/508415-ibdtipp-poll.aspx#ixzz2998NIqGc</a>    <br />The standard report rounds Obama&#8217;s lead down to 0%    <br />&#8220;NATIONAL (IBD/TIPP Tracking): Obama 46, Romney 46&#8221;<br />    <br />The two average Romney up 0.25% not 1%<br />    <br />I often read &#8220;percents don&#8217;t add to 100 because of rounding&#8221;.  But somehow this is not OK when subtracting rather than rounding. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />update: Singiser notes that (with the standard silly rounding) Romney&#8217;s national poll lead for the day declined from 1.3% to 1%.  He notes that this is totally statistically insignificant and not worth wasting thousands of pixels to criticize as I do below.<br />    <br />It matters to people silly enough to try to back out daily results from trackers.  To be maximally silly I will use the rounded numbers released yesterday (actually day before yesterday here in Rome).<br />    <br />Gallup 10/11 minus Gallup 10/5 (silly rounded) comes up as a shocking Romney up by 1.4% (shockng as 10/5 should have been a great day for Romney) not an even more shocking 7%.<br />    <br />IBD/TIPP 10/11 minus IBS/TIPP 10/6  (silly rounded) comes out as Obama up 10.2  not 6.<br />    <br />The estimate for a normal day vs the two dread days after the debate is 4.4%  with half silly rounding not -0.5% with all silly rounding.  With silly rounding (both days for both pollsters) it looks as if the debate effect was permanent not a bounce. With silly rounding for the second latest day and not the latest day, it looks as if the debate effect was temporary.  This is all silly, because it is torturing the poor numbers to try to make them say something they don&#8217;t know, but the point estimates are not small.</p>

                                <p>Lifted from Robert&#8217;s site:</p>
<p>Ezra Klein <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/09/25/the-case-for-raising-taxes-on-capital-gains/#comments">defends an increased capital gains tax as necessary for distributionally neutral base broadening rate lowering tax reform.. </a> I support a higher capital gains tax rate (did not have space for that in my comment).<br />    <br />My comment:</p>
<p>But why do you want base-broadening, rate-lowering tax reform  ?  The inside the beltway wonk consensus is that this must be good.  The claim is that it is more efficient.  Surely true if efficiency is measured as dollars raised per page of tax code or dollar of compliance cost.  But the argument is that the important advantage is that such reform will reduce distortions due to taxes.  Here the implicit arguments are both that high rates cause distortions and that deductions and credits and such allow socially costly tax avoidance. I consider them in turn:</p>
<p>1) High rates are bad. There is almost no evidence for this claim. It is an article of faith for Republicans and Democrats have decided that they can get more important changes in exchange for lower rates.  But as far as I know (and I&#8217;ve published in the Journal of Public Economics) the claim is not supported by actual evidence.   </p>
<p>2) Tax expenditures are worse than just giving the money to corporations and rich individuals because they distort decisions.  Here I think opposition to tax expenditures in general is like opposition to government&#8217;spending in general.  No one likes either in the abstract. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>You wouldn&#8217;t really argue that way too many Americans had health insurance because employer provided health insurance was not taxed as income.  So that is one major bit of base broadening you would have opposed at least pre ACA (except on a &#8216;the worse it is the better it is&#8217; Leninist principle). </p>
<p>How about the EITC.  You know that is one tax expenditure that Republicans want to cut.  It is also one of the very best policies there is (one of the key ways US policy is vastly better than European policy along with &#8230; uh give me a minute).  How about the charitable gift deduction ? It can be abused but seems basically OK to me.<br />    <br />I think a lot of the broad support for base broadening is based on hatred of the mortgage interest deduction.  It means huge houses far from work and driving cars and global warming.  It diverts saving from productive capital labor productivity and wage increasing capital to houses which just sit there.  Suburban and Exurban because that&#8217;s where the new building is.  Also completely totally politically untouchable and you know it.  You might as well base your hopes on cutting rates and increasing the tax on gasoline by a dollar a gallon plus imposing a $100 dollar a ton carbon tax.  Fine policy, but not a policy proposal of any relevance to the US debate.<br />    <br />The most extreme case is someone (not you a friend of yours) who said we have to radically simplify the corporate tax code so corporations spend money on engineers not lawyers and accountants.  That is to increase corporate R and D and eliminate the R and D tax credit.<br />    <br />3) This is not an argument for base broadening and not at all relevant to this blog, but I think every aging Washington wonk&#8217;s favorite year is 1986.  Genuinely bipartisan, wonk driven reform.  It was great.  But what good did it do ?</p>

<div><span lang="EN">I&#8217;m feeling lonely out on this limb, but I think I will defend Bernanke and criticize Woodford ((and admit I only read the concluding section and the first two sections on foreward guidance of <a href="http://kansascityfed.org/publicat/sympos/2012/mw.pdf?sm=jh083112-4">his talk)</a> *.pdf but no warning. Open it).  Medium and long term Treasury rates are extraordinarily low.  It seems to me that we can deduce three things from this. 
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">1) Pessimism about real GDP
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN">2) Low expected inflation
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN">3) Bond traders are confident that the Fed will keep the target federal funds rate at essentially zero for a good long while (at least through 2015 <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/monetary-policy-lower-bounds.html">see this</a>)
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Krugman and the league of reality based economists like to stress points 1 and 2, but point 3 is just as solid.  No possible forward guidance can get the 5 year rate under 0. 
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN">The Krugman/Woodford/Eggertsson/(apologies to those I missed) point always was that even if the monetary authority can&#8217;t get the safe short term rate lower, it *might* be able to influence the safe short term rate expected to hold a few years in the future.   But how much lower can that expected rate go?  The 5 year rate was 0.66% the last time I checked.  It is hard to imagine that Bernanke can make credible promises about policy after the end of his current term.  A negative real federal funds rate is very very far from normal (I&#8217;d say normal is about 2 % real). There is every sign that the Fed has given about all the forward guidance to bond traders that can be given. 
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">OK my thoughts on Woodfords thoughts and empirical work on forward guidance.  First I will refer to figures but not cut and paste them (not respect for copyright but laziness). Please click the links.  My only real point is that all of the shifts in interest rates are tiny.  The largest is on the order of 0.15%.  Even if interpreted as a shift in predicted short rates due to a shift in beliefs about the monetary authorities future policy, this just can’t be a big deal.  The results are consistent with important additional benefits from a 15 or maybe a 10 year commitment to extremely low interest rates.  But the current monetary authorities just can’t do that, because they probably won’t be in office.
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div>After the jump I work through the first two sections on monetary guidance.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN"><br /><a name="more"></a></div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">I note that the theory of forward guidance section ends with warnings about how difficult it is to make such a policy work
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>These matters are not simple
</p>
</div>
<div>ones, and require considerable attention to the way the central bank communicates
</p>
</div>
<div>about its objectives, procedures and decisions. The problem is all the more difficultwhen one must communicate about how an unprecedented situation will be dealt with.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">But the part which really bothers me is the discussion of empirical evidence of effects of forward policy guidance.  Section 1.2.1 “Does Central Bank Speech Matter” (which really should be titled “does central Bank Speech other than explicit forward guidance matter”) concludes
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i><span lang="EN">“one cannot say that these results provide clear
</p>
<p></i><i>evidence of an ability to change beliefs about the reaction function.”</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">The next section on explicit forward guidance includes the disclaimer
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i><span lang="EN">“It is therefore of interest to consider what has happened on these occasions, even if one cannot do formal hypothesis tests with such a small sample of events, each rather unique.”</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">I’m not sure I agree.  The number of data points is equal to the number of transactions in financial markets.  Figure 1 seems to show statistically significant evidence of a drop of expected future overnight interest rates of about 10 to 15 whole basis points.  Wow.  This could be expected to have uh not much effect on anything anyone cares about because 15 basis points sure aint a lot. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN"> Woodford is a very smart guy but when he writes </div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<blockquote><p><i><span lang="EN">“It is useful to note not only that OIS rates for maturities as long as six to twelve months fall, but that the longer maturities fall more; that is, not only does the OIS yield curve fall in response to the announcement, but it flattens.”</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">He uses <span lang="EN">bold face type<span lang="EN"> to discuss a difference of 2 or 3 basis points.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">But wait, there’s more.  The 10-15 percent decline at the time of the announcement on April 21 2009 didn’t last
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">“One also observes from Figure 2 that, during the first week of June the forward rate shot up again, to a level greater than 50 basis points (and higher than in the period before the “conditional commitment”).
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">This is evidence presented by someone who concludes that forward guidance is important – that an extraordinary (perhaps unprecedented) announcement managed to get 12 month rates to decline by up to 15 basis points for about 40 days and 40 nights.

</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Woodford goes on to discuss Fed announcements.   First he notes a decrease of about 10 basis points again. Then he stresses in Figure 4 a decline of around 5 basis points (cheating on the timing one can get it up to around 10 basis points).  Figure 4 has a scale from 5 to 25 basis points.  The legend  includes the note that instead of the 5 year rate, the graph shows the 5 year rate minus 50 basis points.  I can’t make decent figures to save my life, but that’s unusual.  Almost substantively it may be Kosher but is not Kosher for passover to make a tiny change look large by graphing comparable variables on different scales.  Also really Five (<span lang="EN">5<span lang="EN">) basis points. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Woodford also discusses evidence other than event studies and then writes </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i>while market movements during a very short time window around an announcement can reasonably be attributed to news contained in the announcement, developments since 2010 of the kind shown in Figures 5 through 8 might alternatively be attributed simply to market participants’ increasing doubts that conditions would warrant an increase in the funds rate target anytime soon, for reasons unrelated to the FOMC’s statements.</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">In other words nothing much to see in figures 5 through 8.  He does however note that the median blue chip forecaster made a forecast of the duration of extremely low federal funds rate which corresponded to the FOMCs prediction.  That evidence in figure 5 tends to suggest (just using the median as the only summary statistic) very little room for a larger effect on forecasts of policy based on a (cross my heart and hope to die and if I break my word all shall know that I am no gentleman and should feel free to spit on me) promise not a hedged conditional prediction.  The evidence presented in figure 5 has no effect whatsoever on Woodford’s concluding section in which he discusses how the Fed could give more effective forward guidance.  There is so far in the paper at most a few basis points of evidence that Canadian or US forward guidance could possibly be more convincing.
</p>
</div>

<div><span lang="EN">Oh noooo it seems I am disagreeing with Lars Svensson too
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i>In a review of Sweden’s experience, Deputy Governor Lars Svensson (2010) argues that, through December 2008, the Riksbank had been relatively successful at “managing expectations” through its policy.</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">So what about evidence ? Case 1
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p><i>The result is that an announcement that was intended to shift down the anticipated
</p>
<p></i><i>forward path of rates, by announcing that a low rate would be maintained until</i><i>the beginning of 2011, and so to immediately lower longer-term interest rates, had</i><i>exactly the opposite effect: long rates rose, because the entire anticipated forward path of rates shifted up. </i><i>What went wrong? </i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Figure 10 shows a shift in the wrong direction of roughly a big big 15 basis points.  The average shift in the event studies is no longer around 0.1% but rather more like 0.05%
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Next
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><p>Svensson (2010) argues instead that survey data on traders’ forecasts of inflation and growth indicate that they were no more optimistic than the Riksbank, and hence that market participants simply did not accept the Riksbank’s forecasts about <i>its own future approach to policy.</i></p></blockquote>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">So now I feel less bad about disagreeing with Svensson too, since Svensson too disputes the claim made by Svensson.  Also Woodford seems to dispute Svensson’s claim
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>If so, it would seem that the attempt to use forward guidance more aggressively after April 2009 has been associated with a loss of market confidence in the informativeness of the Riksbank’s projections. Whether it will return once macroeconomic conditions have normalized remains to be seen.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span lang="EN">But in any case all of the interest rate shifts discussed in the empirical section are so tiny as to matter little. So three out of four have the desired sign.  Wow. 
</p>
</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">And this in a speech on the importance of forward guidance !  What could a skeptic add ?</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">OK the standard 2 disclaimers.  Woodford also discusses the direct effect of purchases of risky assets on the risk that private investors feel they are bearing so on asset prices and so on the economy.  He advocates the purchase of more MBS.  I absolutely agree with that.</div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">Also, of course, it is better to light one small candle that curse against the darkness.  If indeed more vigorous efforts to influenc forecasts of future monetary policy will have only a small positive effect, then they definitely should be made.  </div>
<div><span lang="EN"></div>
<div><span lang="EN">A very strange aspect of the discussion is that people who are sure that it would be easy for monetary authorities to get economies back to full employment quickly are de facto allies of people who expect the effects of shifts in monetary policy to be small but of the right sign.  Both agree on what is to be done, so almost no one stresses the huge scientific disagreements.</div>

<blockquote>In the years since the Bankruptcy Reform Act passed in 1978, the nominal price of college tuition has risen more than 900 percent. Over the same period the median male income &#8211; again, nominally &#8211; has risen 165 percent. And since the percentage of the workforce boasting a bachelor’s degree has expanded from less than 20 percent to nearly a third, I don’t have to convince you that the median de facto return on investment on those diplomas has diminished greatly over the same years.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal-a/2012_08/the_nondischargeability_of_stu039480.php">Via Kathleen Geier</a> (Too many vowels and too kind to Tcacik &#8212; also I have just read Geier&#8217;s excerpts).</p>
<p>I think I could maybe be convinced indeed that there are some serious calculations of the return on investment in which return on investment (on debt for college) has diminished.  But that claim isn&#8217;t demonstrated by the numbers given in the article, because two key numbers are missing.  <strong>One</strong> is the effect of a college degree on salaries which has vastly, vastly increased since 1978. <strong>The other</strong> is the opportunity cost of lost labor income and labor market experience.  </p>
<p>The increase in this cost is roughly along the lines of the increase in median wages (but is lower).  The issue is that if A increases proportionally less than B then A+B increases proportionally less than B.</p>
<p>The nominal cost of getting a college degree has *not* increased 9 fold &#8212; in 1978 a far the larger part of the cost was the opportunity cost.  I think this is still more than half.  I think the total cost of tuition fees plus lost earnings plus lost labor market experience has roughly roughly doubled.</p>
<p>The implication of the reference to the fraction with diplomas is clearly that the college/just high school wage differential has declined due to increased supply of college graduates.  But that differential has vastly increased.  It was very low in 1978 (which happens to be the year I went to college).  I wasn&#8217;t there (didn&#8217;t take the course) but I know freshmen in introductory economics were told that they would have gotten a better return on the total cost (tuition fees plus lost wages) investing in treasuries and labor market experience.</p>
<p>This ceased to be true in the 80s with a huge huge increase in the college wage premium.  Salary with a diploma minus salary with just a high school diploma divided by salary with just a high school diploma much much more than doubled. It remains very high.</p>
<p>Note also that inflation wasn&#8217;t helping students in 1978.  The high expected inflation lead to high nominal interest rates.  The people who made out like bandits at the banks&#8217; expense were people who had borrowed before inflation was high &#8212; basically home owners who signed fixed interest rate 30 year mortgages in 1973 and before.</p>

                                <p>Matt Miller has <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-the-rise-of-the-drawbridge-republicans/2012/08/20/d426c7f8-eb16-11e1-9ddc-340d5efb1e9c_story.html">an excellent column</a> in The Washington Post in which he coins the phrase &#8220;Drawbridge Republicans.&#8221;  Basically he accuses Romney and Ryan of being pro-rich class warriors who aim to eliminate equality of outcome and of opportunity.    A very standard Rhetorical gesture is to concede in the second or third paragraph of an essay that there are shades of grey and fault on both sides each of which has a point.  I think that for Miller that this is a reflex(also for others including say the President &#8212; I call the trope an &#8220;obamanation&#8221;).  I also think that a part of this phase of writing a well made essay all critical facilities are turned off.  Such an aside must be part of a good essay and no data are relevant.  The alleged obamanation follows  <br />
<blockquote>(In case you were wondering, Ronald Reagan wasn’t a Drawbridge because he entered office when marginal rates, at 70 percent , were truly damaging to the economy. But as GOP business leaders now tell me privately, the Clinton-era top rate of 39.6 percent, let alone today’s 35 percent, are hardly a barrier to work or investment).</p></blockquote>
<p>(parentheses his).  Disclaimer: This post will include exactly 1 link.  All claims of fact will be based on my memory.  Note the complete lack of any data supporting the flat claim that 70 percent marginal rates were truly damaging.  The only hint of an explanation of the alleged damage is in the following paragraph &#8220;a barrier to work or investment.&#8221;</p>
<p> I don&#8217;t have to remind readers of this blog that 70% marginal rates sure don&#8217;t seem to have been a barrier to work and investment in the 60s nor were 90% marginal rates obviously a barrier to work and investment in the 40s and 50s.    First there is very little evidence for an effect of taxes (or wages or interest rates) on male labor supply.  This was well known in 1981.  The elastic labor supply is married women&#8217;s labor force participation.  This increased enormously during the period of 70% marginal tax rates.  Notably, the labor supply choice doesn&#8217;t depend only on marginal rates (it isn&#8217;t a small change).  There is no evidence that the elimination of 70% rates removed a significant barrier to work.</p>
<p> The idea that the Kemp-Roth-Reagan tax cuts removed a barrier to investment just can&#8217;t be reconciled with the data.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p> In fact they were followed by a period of extremely low fixed capital investment.  This is unsurprising given the extremely high real interest rates which, in turn, are unsurprising given the high budget deficits caused by the Kemp-Roth-Reagan tax cuts.    One mildly odd thing in the Miller parenthetical aside is the equation of saving and investment.  I will accept the equation which makes sense in the long term although our current problem is high planned saving and low planned investment.  But the Kemp-Roth-Reagan tax cuts did not have the effect on private savings which proponents predicted.  Instead there was anomalously high private consumption.  This is in addition to the massive resulting public dis-saving (deficits).  There is vastly vastly vastly less than no evidence that the end of 70% marginal tax rates contributed to capital formation.  The more nearly rational advocates of low marginal rates (by which I mean the more nearly rational critics of 70% marginal rates) argue that the important issue is tax avoidance not labor supply or consumption savings decisions.</p>
<p> The argument is that there are efficiency losses due to tax avoidance strategies such as investing in tax shelters (to obtain income losses and capital gains).  So a semi-rational defender of Kemp-Roth-Reagan could ask if there was a marked reduction in the vigor of tax sheltering etc.  That&#8217;s a good question, but the answer is that there was a huge gigantic massive increase in the vigor of tax sheltering.  This was widely noted at the time.  But surely there must be something good that can be said about the Kemp-Roth tax cuts which isn&#8217;t based on ignoring all available data ?  I suppose there probably is, but for the life of me, I can&#8217;t think of it.</p>
