Central banks around the world have been intervening today to prevent further volatility in exchange rates, but that still doesn&#8217;t explain exactly why currency traders have been so eager to buy yen this week.  </p>
<p>There are rarely easy answers to questions involving exchange rate movements.  However, I have shared a few thoughts on the subject over at <em><a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/">The Street Light</a></em>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I give up. It was perfectly obvious what was happening at Fukushima on Saturday afternoon, when I <a href="http://xnerg.blogspot.com/2011/03/basic-reminders-of-nuclear-power.html">posted bullet points at Skippy</a>: there was going to be a major cleanup cost and the live reactors were not salvageable, but nothing fatal to many was loose in the atmosphere yet.</p>
<p>Which is why I followed up here on Sunday with &#8220;<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/03/tradeoffs-saltwater-edition.html">use saltwater as the best option</a>.&#8221; Once you accept that you&#8217;re doing damage control, do it efficiently and don&#8217;t worry about the sunk cost.</p>
