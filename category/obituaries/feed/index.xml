				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On Wednesday, December 19, 2012 <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/20/us/robert-h-bork-conservative-jurist-dies-at-85.html?pagewanted=1&#038;_r=1">Robert Heron Bork died at age 85</a>.  <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/john-cooks-gawker-bork-obituary-causing-furor-through-honesty-2012-12">I did not mourn</a>.</p>
<p>Bork  first became infamous in 1973 for his role in the &#8220;Saturday night  massacre&#8221; when as Solicitor General, the number three position in the  Justice Department, he carried out, under President Nixon&#8217;s orders, the  firing of Watergate Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox.  Bork inherited  this task when both Attorney General Elliot Richardson and Deputy  Attorney General William Ruckelshaus resigned in protest.  This much is  well known.  What sometimes gets left out of the discussion, though, is  that due to the manner in which Cox&#8217;s position was created and defined, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre">he could not be removed except for cause</a>.   Doing a good job of tracking down evidence relevant to the case he was  pursuing does not qualify as cause.  This was a defining moment in  Bork&#8217;s career, in which he conveniently chose power over principle.</p>
<p>Most  recently he was the senior judicial adviser to Mitt Romney’s  unsuccessful presidential campaign, but he is best known for being  rejected as a Supreme Court justice when nominated for that position in  1987 by Ronald Reagan.  After his nomination was defeated by  a 58-42 vote in the Senate, his name was verberized into a neologism  that was [<a href="http://www.propublica.org/article/was-petraeus-borked"><u>and occasionally still is</u></a>] used almost exclusively in the passive voice.</p>
<p>To be &#8220;borked,&#8221; as his supporters would have it, is to be subjected to  unfair criticisms based on distortions of your words, actions, and  beliefs.  But his radically reactionary views on <a href="http://www.nwlc.org/our-blog/romney-advisor-robert-bork-equal-protection-clause-doesn%E2%80%99t-protect-against-sex-discriminati">equal protection and sex discrimination</a> were typical of his extreme and perverse positions. The mere fact that he was able to speak out <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/23/opinion/l-bork-hearings-showed-how-democracy-works-a-very-small-poll-tax-174787.html">in favor of a poll tax</a> speaks volumes.  In reality, the borking of Bork consisted of <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/12/robert-bork">subjecting him to valid criticism</a> based on <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/12/19/robert_borks_nauseating_worldview/">the precise meanings</a> of his words, actions  and beliefs.  <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2012/12/postscript-robert-bork-1927-2012.html#ixzz2FnPlFnfD">Jeffrey Toobin explains</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Bork was “borked” simply by being confronted with his own  views—which would have undone many of the great constitutional landmarks  in recent American history. As Senator Edward Kennedy put it in a  famous speech on the Senate floor, “Robert Bork’s America is a land in  which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit  at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens’  doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about  evolution, [and] writers and artists would be censored at the whim of  government.” </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote> Was Kennedy too harsh? He was not—as Bork himself demonstrated in the  series of intemperate books he wrote after losing the Supreme Court  fight and quitting the bench, in 1987. The titles alone were revealing:  ”The Tempting of America,” “Slouching Towards Gomorrah: Modern  Liberalism and American Decline,” and “Coercing Virtue: The Worldwide  Rule of Judges.” One of his last books may have summed up his views  best. Thanks in part to decisions of the Supreme Court—decisions that,  for the most part, Bork abhorred—the United States became a more  tolerant and inclusive place, with greater freedom of expression and  freedom from discrimination than any society in history. Bork called the  book, accurately, “A Country I Do Not Recognize.”  </p></blockquote>
<p>Indeed,  Bork&#8217;s words and actions were consistently anti-gay, anti-female,  anti-minority, always favoring government intrusion over citizen&#8217;s  rights, businesses over people, big business over small, and  corporations over government.  His supporters would argue that these  conclusions are based on principled positions, and that the outcomes,  however repugnant to idealists, are therefore legitimate.  I argue  instead that policies that consistently result in the contraction rather  than the expansion of basic human rights, and that continually  disadvantage definable target groups are corrupt at their core, and that  the negative results are inherent and predictable. </p>
<p>After his defeat, Robert Bork  gradually faded away from the public consciousness.  I can tell you, in  the intervening 25 years, I gave him virtually no thought at all.</p>
<p>But Bork had enormous, possibly even dominant influence on <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/12/20/antitrust-was-defined-by-robert-bork-i-cannot-overstate-his-influence/">the modern interpretation of anti-trust law</a>,  perhaps single-handedly redefining the scope and purpose of anti-trust  legislation.  Basically, Bork was pro-efficiency and anti-anti-trust.   He had swallowed whole the bait-bucket of Chicago-economic-school ideas of  market efficiency, and built the entire framework of his pro-trust  belief system on that invalid foundation.</p>
<p>It seems fair to say that it is in some part because of Bork&#8217;s  influence that we now have trans-national mega-corporations with huge oligopolies and near-monopolies.  These corporations have no inherent loyalty  to anyone nor anything.  In my view, the oligarchs that run them do not  even have a general sense of loyalty to stock-holders, let alone the  broader universe of stake-holders, who mainly exist to be exploited.</p>
<p>Efficiency, in and of itself is a good thing.  But it cannot be achieved  in a vacuum &#8211; frequently there are externalities that are largely negative.  For  one thing, the efficiencies are mainly internalized and do not  necessarily represent a more broadly efficient society.  Second, as a  market gets concentrated, competition decreases and the pressure to  improve, or even maintain status-quo efficiency slowly erodes.  This  ultimately leads to a situation where big, lumbering and inefficient but  extremely powerful entities control the economic and political  landscape.  Yes, Big Oil, Big Pharma, Big Insurance, Big Finance, I am  looking at you.</p>
<p>Perhaps worse, though, is the power asymmetry that results from size and  influence.  Suppliers, customers, and the public at large are  overwhelmed by the sheer might of these institutions, leading to even  greater concentrations of power and wealth.</p>
<p>The end  game is some version of economic collapse.  It happened in the  1930&#8217;s, and &#8211; due largely to neoclassical Chicago-style economic  thinking that has over the last 40 years willfully unlearned the lessons  of that time &#8211; it  happened again in 2008.</p>
<p>Most of the time, evil doesn&#8217;t  manifest as some cackling cartoon villain, mad-man on a murderous  rampage, or even an unjust war waged on false pretenses.  It results  instead, in a far more banal but  far-reaching way, from the highly refined ideas of men like Robert Bork  who value abstract concepts such as efficiency over the effects the  programs they institute have on the lives of real human beings.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>UPDATE: For those who read here and not at CR, a link for <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/12/tanta-donation-information.html">Donations</a>.</p>
<p>We knew she was home with her family, but it was over the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Calculated Risk:</p>
<p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/11/sad-news-tanta-passes-away.html">Sad News: Tanta Passes Away</a>: My dear friend and co-blogger Doris “Tanta” Dungey passed away early this morning. I would like to express my deepest condolences to her family and friends&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Tanta was one of the people—along with CR, PGL, DeLong, and Mark Thoma (and probably a few others I&#8217;ve overlooked, such as Max Sawicky**)—who proved early on that long, informative blog posts about issues that might be considered arcane* could find an audience.*** Including people who knew what you were talking about and could provide complementary insights and information.</p>
<p>Via CR, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/business/01tanta.html?_r=1&#038;pagewanted=print">David Streitfeld sums it up</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Thanks in large part to Tanta’s contributions, Calculated Risk became a crucial source of prescient analysis as the housing market at first faltered, then collapsed and finally spawned a full-blown credit crisis.</p>
<p>Tanta used her extensive knowledge of the loan industry to comment, castigate and above all instruct. Her fans ranged from the Nobel laureate Paul Krugman, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times who cited her in his blog, to analysts at the Federal Reserve, who cited her in a paper on “Understanding the Securitization of Subprime Mortgage Credit.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There are a lot of people out there who are saying now that &#8220;we all knew there would be a crisis.&#8221;  Tanta is one of the main reasons for that.</p>
<p>She <s>will be</s> is missed.</p>
<p>*Robert Waldmann&#8217;s investigative series on Credit Products is a current AB example.</p>
<p>**The lack of conservative economists on the list is not my fault; the Mankiws and Tyler Cowens of the world rarely if ever go into detail about the system or the implications surrounding their statements.</p>
