				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I took a couple of days to let life interfere with blogging, but none of the standard politics/economics bloggers seems to have highlighted this note from the Lex column of last Wednesday’s (13 October 2010) FT (again, no link; feel free to provide in comments) under the heading “Defence M&#038;A”:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Lockheed has two small services businesses on the block. [These] in particular appear vulnerable as Robert Gates, secretary of defence, <em>looks for back-office savings to fund operational spending.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s pretty much a fair description of the reason for the existence of <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1469749" target="_blank">MERS</a>.* If there is an area of the U.S. economy that it <strike>is more corrupt</strike> has poorer incentive-alignment than FIRE, it is Defense Spending.  Mr. Gates’s willingness to encourage that by removing processing controls does not bode well for long-term budgetary value.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>*Well, the other reason, after tax evasion.</p>
