<p><strong>Crisis in public education</strong></p>
<p>School districts around the country have been hit with a triple whammy of cuts to their funding this year&#8230;</p>
<p>First, the direct aid in the form of federal ARRA has run its course, so they&#8217;re no longer receiving that supplement. </p>
<p>Second, the states have budgetary problems for the same recession-related reasons that federal revenues have declined, and as a result a significant number of them have cut their funds for education and local governments&#8230;</p>
<p>Third and most recently, the decline in housing &#038; commercial property values accompanying the bubble bursting has started to translate into declining property tax revenues&#8230;but even last year, while school districts were supposed to be getting direct aid from the federal stimulus, I was seeing about a half dozen articles a week from districts around the country where cutbacks to their educational programs were being made&#8230;this year, now that federal aid has been cut off, the problem seems to have gotten worse&#8230;</p>
<p>According to the recent BLS <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">Employment Situation Summary</a>,  local governments have lost 416000 jobs since an employment peak in September 2008&#8230;.from what I&#8217;ve observed, it seems the lions share of those job losses have resulted from school district cutbacks&#8230;but it&#8217;s not normally a national story; typically, its a local news story, where upset parents show up at the school board meeting and each district cuts something different; some cut teachers, some spec ed, some cut sports, or art &#038; music, or field trips, still others have cut over a month off the school year&#8230;so im going to try to tell this larger story with links to a number of small ones which have appeared since the beginning of the year&#8230;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<p>There was a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/07/education/07education.html">brief media flurry</a> this recent december when students from the US scored 17th on the OECD&#8221;s standardized PISA tests (<a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;source=web&#038;cd=4&#038;ved=0CC8QFjAD&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnces.ed.gov%2Fsurveys%2Fpisa%2F&#038;ei=nUajTdzlGsXcgQf__KjkBQ&#038;usg=AFQjCNE9MLOiYpda26m0X1bjGeTqEKy-XQ">Program for International Student Assessment), </a>a test where 15 year old students from <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/12/46643496.pdf">Shanghai, Korea, Finland, Hong Kong &#038; Singapore ran away with the honors</a>, and the US got trounced in math&#8230; there were a few calls for education reform, and a <a href="http://www.mcgraw-hillresearchfoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/pisa-intl-competitiveness.pdf">mcgraw hill study</a> showed that in the high achieving educational systems it was &#8220;<i>a tremendous honor to be a teacher, and teachers are afforded a status comparable to what doctors, lawyers and other highly regarded professionals enjoy in the US</i>&#8220;; but for the most part the temporary urgency was overshadowed by concern for holiday retail sales..</p>
<p>T^hen, as the year ended, the <a href="http://www.edtrust.org/">Education Trust</a> issued a report indicating that <a href="http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/175337/tomgram:_william_astore,_we%27re_number_one_%28in_self-promotion%29/#more">nearly a quarter of all applicants to the Armed Forces</a>, despite having a high-school diploma, <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/2010-12-22/us/army.extrance.exam_1_entrance-exam-science-and-reading-tests-scores?_s=PM:US">can’t pass</a> the necessary military entrance exam; not having “the reading, mathematics, science, and problem-solving abilities” to become a private in the U.S. Army&#8230;it wasnt until the state of the union, when <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/25/state-of-the-union-2011-obama-education_n_814039.html">obama invoked the &#8220;sputnik challenge&#8221; metaphor</a>, that education was again in the spotlight&#8230;and even ben bernanke got into the act in early march, when <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/03/bernanke-for-early-childhood-education/">he waded into the state &#038; local budget debates</a> with a speech stressing the need for a competitive high-quality workforce,  lauding the benefits of early childhood education in achieving that  goal&#8230;but for all the official oratory, not a program has been introduced, and as you’ll see below, further cuts have continued&#8230; </p>
<p><a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/7357622.html"><u>Legislative fight expected on class-size limit</u></a> — Among proposed solutions to the state&#8217;s massive budget deficit is changing a <a href="http://topics.chron.com/topics/Texas">Texas</a> law that holds most <a href="http://topics.chron.com/topics/Elementary_school">elementary school</a> classes to no more than 22 students. But teachers groups, backed by Democrats in the House and Senate, say any change will reverse academic gains in elementary schools and force the elimination of as many as 12,000 teaching jobs. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.seattlemedium.com/news/Article/Article.asp?NewsID=106877&#038;sID=4&#038;ItemSource=L"><u>Number Of Homeless Students In State Climbs To 21,000 </u></a>&#8211; They sleep in cars. In parks. In shelters. On the sofas of generous relatives or friends.  They are the more than 1.3 million homeless children nationwide.  Of that total, more than 21,000 live in Washington state, according to numbers submitted to the federal government this past week.  According to the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction, the numbers show that during the 2009-10, the state reported 21,826 homeless students</p>
<p><a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/ci_17032221"><u>State superintendent declares California schools in &#8216;state of emergency&#8221;</u></a> &#8212; Saying schools are in a &#8220;state of financial emergency,&#8221; the Superintendent of Public Instruction on Thursday called on Californians to get involved in local schools and support tax measures that benefit education. He said $18 billion in education cuts over the past three years have caused thousands of layoffs, increased class sizes, shortened school years in many districts and eliminated or reduced programs such as libraries, art and music. He said 174 of the state&#8217;s 1,077 school districts are in financial distress, signaling they may not be able to pay their bills in the next three years</p>
<p><a href="http://blogs.newsobserver.com/campusnotes/unc-estimates-more-job-losses">Campus Notes &#8211; UNC estimates more job losses</a> &#8211; A 5 percent cut to the UNC system budget &#8211; which officials say is a reasonable expectation &#8211;  could result in the loss of 900 jobs across the state. Of those, 400 would like be faculty cuts, according to data being presented this morning to the UNC system&#8217;s Board of Governors. After several years of budget cuts, the system appears ready to reduce its budget again, doing its part to help the state patch a hole in its budget estimated now at more than $3.5 billion. A 10 percent cut would more than double those job eliminations &#8211; to 2,000 positions across the UNC system, including 1,000 professor slots. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.rapidcityjournal.com/news/article_4c24cfb4-244b-11e0-914e-001cc4c002e0.html">School officials say cuts could be &#8216;devastating&#8217;</a> &#8211; School officials say programs and people would be two unavoidable casualties of the 10 percent across-the-board cut to education funding proposed Wednesday by S. Dakota Gov. Dennis Dauggard.  &#8220;For us, it amounts to a $1.4 million loss. If we would try to accomplish that in one year, it would have a devastating effect. He says he has real numbers. What he doesn&#8217;t see is that real numbers affect real people.&#8221; For Rapid City, 10 percent means $7 million.&#8221;There&#8217;s no way we can salvage $7 million in the general fund.”</p>
<p><a href="http://dallasisdblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2011/01/dallas-isd-now-preparing-for-2.html">Dallas ISD now preparing for $260 million funding cut</a>  &#8211; Dallas school officials are now bracing to lose as much as $260 million each of the next school years as lawmakers slash education funding to close a multibillion-dollar deficit. The numbers keep getting worse. A month ago, Superintendent Michael Hinojosa thought <a href="http://topics.dallasnews.com/topic/Dallas_Independent_School_District">Dallas ISD</a> might be out $120 million each of the next two school years. The city of Dallas had two mandatory furlough days in 2009, which saved the city $2.6 million. Trustee Nancy Bingham said this afternoon she favors furloughs because employees wouldn&#8217;t lose their jobs. </p>
<p><a href="http://kutnews.org/post/think-113-million-aisd-deficit-bad-consider-armageddon-scenario">Think $113 Million AISD Deficit Is Bad? Consider This Armageddon Scenario</a> &#8212;<a href="http://www.austinisd.org/inside/board/members.phtml">Austin School Trustees</a> acknowledged they were left with no easy choices last night as they voted 9-0 to approve a plan that <a href="http://kutnews.org/post/post/austin-school-board-approves-485-job-cuts-balanced-budget-still-distant">would eliminate 485 jobs next school year</a>, mostly teachers. The decision was based on<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/47468216/AISD-board-meeting-material-Budget-Options-to-Close-FY2012-Gap-1"> a plan</a> to reduce the $113 million projected budget gap without cutting full day pre-K.  But all those plans could go out the window depending on how the legislature decides to distribute cuts to education funding. At issue is how lawmakers go about defunding education.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2011/01/31/long-beach-unified-prepares-send-out-621-teacher-p/">Long Beach Unified prepares to send out 621 preliminary layoff notices to teachers</a> &#8211; Administrators at the Long Beach Unified School District say proposed budget cuts are likely to force the district in the next month to send out more than 600 Reduction In Force notices to employees with teaching credentials. If the proposed layoffs are made final by summer, the ensuing teacher cuts would mean a minimum class size increase of five students in kindergarten, first, second and third grades. The increase would lead to 30-students classes in those grades. Classes in grades sixth through 12th grade would increase by two students to 34 students per class. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.omaha.com/article/20110201/NEWS01/702019933/469">Nothing Off Limits On OPS Budget </a>&#8211; Class sizes could go up. Some programs, such as summer school or programs for the gifted, could be scaled back. And new textbooks could wait a year. All of those are options as Omaha Public Schools look to make budget cuts next school year. District administrators are seeking to make cuts totaling $22.2 million, including $11.1 million from programs funded by federal stimulus money that runs out after this year. Teachers, school board members and administrators say the list is intended to ignite discussions with the public and OPS staff about where to make cuts. “There&#8217;s nothing that&#8217;s off the table at this point,” </p>
<p><a href="http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2011/02/pennsylvania_schools_could_los.html">Pennsylvania schools could lose $1 billion</a> &#8211; Less than three weeks after taking office, Gov. Tom Corbett is swinging the budget axe at public schools.  Schools may lose up $1 billion in state aid in the coming school year, setting up one of three scenarios.  Homeowners could see substantial property tax increases.  School boards may slash programs and jobs in the coming school year.  Or families may take a hit to their wallets and still see school programs or jobs wiped out. How big is a $1 billion loss? It amounts to about a fifth of the $5.1 billion that the state budgeted for basic education this year.  </p>
<p><a href="http://www.blacklistednews.com/index.php?news_id=12500">New York City May Fire 21,000 Teachers</a> &#8211; New York City could lose $1 billion in education aid from the state, forcing the nation&#8217;s largest school system to cut more than 21,000 teachers, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said Friday.. If the governor proposes a $1 billion cut and the Legislature approves it, the mayor estimated the city would be forced to cut 15,000 teachers, most of which would be accomplished through layoffs. That&#8217;s on top of plans, outlined by the mayor in November, to cut 6,166 teachers in the fiscal year beginning July 1.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-14/la-school-board-contemplates-up-to-5-000-layoffs.html">LA school board contemplates up to 5000 layoffs</a> &#8211; The Los Angeles school board is set to vote on authorizing layoff warning notices for more than 5,000 employees, including 4,000 teachers, in a bid to close a $408 million budget deficit for the 2011-2012 academic year. The board will vote Tuesday on the warning notices, which by state law must be sent by March 15. The notices do not mean that all employees who receive them will lose their jobs on June 30. The exact number of layoffs will depend on whether voters approve state budget balancing measures on the ballot in June. </p>

Early projections for the 2011-2012 school year show an excess of expenses over revenues of $5,328,329.Mr. Dixon explained the key factors driving the projected deficit. On the revenue side, an estimated drop in students from 5,582 to 5,518 would decrease revenue by $371,840. The loss of federal funding (from ARRA and Edujobs federal sources) is projected to total $1,774,213 in decreased revenue compared to the current school year. On the expense side, rising retirement costs present a significant financial burden to the district. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/15/us-detroit-layoffs-idUSTRE73E0HG20110415">Detroit to send layoff notices to all its public teachers</a> (Reuters) &#8211; The emergency manager appointed to put Detroit&#8217;s troubled public school system on a firmer financial footing said on Thursday he was sending layoff notices to all of the district&#8217;s 5,466 unionized employees.In a statement posted on the website of Detroit Public Schools, Robert Bobb, the district&#8217;s temporary head, said notices were being sent to every member of the Detroit Federation of Teachers &#8220;in anticipation of a workforce reduction to match the district&#8217;s declining student enrollment.&#8221; Bobb said nearly 250 administrators were receiving the notices, too.The district is unlikely to eliminate all the teachers. Last year, it sent out 2,000 notices and only a fraction of employees were actually laid off. But the notices are required by the union&#8217;s current contract with the district. Any layoffs under this latest action won&#8217;t take effect until late July.</p>

The bill, LD 1346, establishes a &#8216;training wage&#8217; for employees under 20 years of age at $5.25 per hour for their first 180 days of employment and increases the amount of hours minors can legally work. The proposed &#8216;training wage&#8217; is over two dollars less than the state&#8217;s current minimum wage. The bill also would eliminate the maximum hours a minor over 16 can work during school days and allow minors to work over 50 hours a week when school is not in session. Another bill, LD 516, is headed to the Senate floor for a vote after being passed along party lines by a Senate committee, with Democrats voting against the measure. It would allow minors 16 years and older to work up to six hours a day and until 11pm on a school night.</p>

Jane Cunningham [R] has introduced a bill to minimize child labor laws. SB 222 – This act modifies the child labor laws. It eliminates the prohibition on employment of children under age fourteen. Restrictions on the number of hours and restrictions on when a child may work during the day are also removed. It also repeals the requirement that a child ages fourteen or fifteen obtain a work certificate or work permit in order to be employed. Children under sixteen will also be allowed to work in any capacity in a motel, resort or hotel where sleeping accommodations are furnished. </p>
<p>i wonder what kind of message we are sending to our young people when at the first sign of budget troubles, it is funding their education that we chose to cut&#8230;and how many <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2011/03/17/how-we-teach-our-graduates-not-to-teach-38880/">promising young educators are being discouraged or let go</a> in the process&#8230;the continuing decimation of our human capital is certainly a national problem worse than our crumbling infrastructure&#8230;while there are those in congress who pretend to be worried about leaving debt for the next generation, they are leaving the next generation without the tools to compete in an increasingly challenging future&#8230;</p>
