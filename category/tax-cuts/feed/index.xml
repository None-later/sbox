				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Just watch this.  It is 1 minute long.<br />Update: added a couple links* </p>
<p>Could it be anymore surreal?</p>
<p>This was from an episode which aired May 12th, 1992!  I asked <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/can-we-please-broaden-our-thinking-in.html" target="_blank">September 2008</a>:   HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS?  HOW MANY FREAKIN’ TIMES DO WE HAVE TO LEARN THE LESSON?</p>
<p> Obviously, the lesson has not been relearned since at least sometime before 1992.  If it had been <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/05/there-is-difference-between-then-and.html" target="_blank">relearned,</a> we would not be here still proposing solutions that sound just like, almost word for word <a href="http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/Web/THM1901?OpenDocument" target="_blank">like the 1920&#8217;s.</a>  (start reading at 1920) I mean, it&#8217;s not like <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/04/longest-recession-ever.html" target="_blank">people haven&#8217;</a>t been<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/its-big-one-honey-i-know-it.html" target="_blank"> sounding the horn</a> on what <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/01/i-got-your-real-state-of-union-right.html" target="_blank">the results </a>would be from the<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/monetary-policy-im-not-only-not-feeling.html" target="_blank"> proposed solutions</a> in 1992.   Nope, it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/07/wages-driven-down-now-relative-to.html" target="_blank">same proposals</a> as in 1992, which will produce more of the same.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> I sometimes get the &#8216;eyes rolling&#8217; reaction from people in my social sphere when I insist that at least linking to  original documents is important, and that someone needs to follow up on what an author says someone else says (as a way to gain traction and authority status for their own writing, such as saying the non-partisan Tax Policy Centers says).  I won&#8217;t go into the idea of spin, which involves figuring out intent.  Mine is a caution for readers:</p>
<p>The post is lifted from a note from Daniel Becker in response to a query I sent to him&#8230;Dan is a small businessman in the way most of us think of as small business.  (The IRS has a different criterion  of ownership that allows a company like <i>Bechtal </i>at $31 billion to be considered a small business).</p>
<p>Dan Becker&#8217;s note:</p>
<p>The Washington Post article is   <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/obama-calls-for-small-business-tax-breaks/2012/11/27/83575192-389d-11e2-b01f-5f55b193f58f_story.html"><i>Obama calls for small business tax break</i>s</a>.   The article uses the  <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/2013-Temporary-Tax-Relief-to-Create-Jobs-and.cfm">Tax Policy Center</a> original under the title <i>Temporary Tax Relief to Create Jobs </i> as the source for the reporting.</p>
<p>The WP article notes:</p>
<p>&#8220;The last time the country had a similar proposal to the tax subsidy was during the Carter administration, according to the Tax Policy Center. Research by the Labor Department found that few firms knew about the tax policy, but those that did increased employment notably.&#8221;    </p>
<p>But from their source it actually notes:    <br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The last experience the United States had with a credit for incremental employment was with the new jobs credit enacted at the beginning of the Carter Administration in 1977. Evaluations of that credit <a href="http://taxvox.taxpolicycenter.org/sunley.pdf">and how it came about</a> found that most firms were either unaware of the credit or did not respond to it. <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/aea/aecrev/v69y1979i2p173-79.html">Research based on a Department of Labor survey</a> found that only 6 percent of firms who knew about the credit said that it prompted them to hire more workers. Firms that were aware of the credit, however, increased employment about 3 percent more than other firms. &#8221;   (bolding is Dan B.&#8217;s)</p></blockquote>
<p>WP had another smoothing over (under the fold):<br />      <br /><a name="more"></a><br />&#8220;An incremental jobs credit could be a cost-effective way of raising employment in the short run, the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/2013-Temporary-Tax-Relief-to-Create-Jobs-and.cfm">nonpartisan center said in a report</a> this year. The effectiveness of any jobs subsidy depends . . . on how employers perceive its potential benefits when making hiring decisions.&#8221;</p>
<p>The actual statement:     <br />
<blockquote>In summary, the effect of this proposal on employment is very uncertain. In theory, an incremental jobs credit could be a cost-effective way of raising employment in the short run and some research suggests that the 1977 credit did increase jobs, although the evidence on that is far from conclusive.<br />The effectiveness of any jobs subsidy depends greatly on both the details of the proposal, still to be finalized, and on how employers perceive its potential benefits when making hiring decisions.</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Dan B</i></p>
<p>(Editorial comment at end of note from Dan Becker&#8230;.Man! They still want to believe that cutting taxes is actually the same as if the 99% were now getting that $1 trillion of income that is now with the 1%. Just like they believe cutting taxes will increase revenues (sure if you convince the dictator to stop taking a full 90% of all that his people produce, but that&#8217;s not US).</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Via <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2012/11/wsj-.html" target="_blank">Taxprof blog</a><br /><i>Wall Street Journal:  Tax Twist: At Some Firms, Cutting Corporate Rates May Cost Billions</i>:<br />
<blockquote>What Uncle Sam has given to the earnings of companies like Citigroup, AIG, and Ford he soon might take away.
<p>President Barack Obama has said, most recently during last month&#8217;s presidential debates, that the 35% U.S. corporate tax rate should be cut. That would mean lower tax bills for many companies. But it also could prompt large write-downs by Citigroup, AIG, Ford and other companies that hold piles of &#8220;deferred tax assets,&#8221; or DTAs.<br />After posting big losses, these companies have tax credits and deductions they can use to defray future tax bills, thus providing a boost to earnings. But a tax-rate reduction means some of those credits and deductions, counted as assets on the balance sheet, would be worth less, since lower tax bills would mean fewer opportunities to use them before they expire. That would force the companies to write down their value, resulting in charges against earnings.</p>
<p>&#8230;<br />&#8230;the company believes tax change should &#8220;include transition measures that mitigate impacts and avoid negative unintended results&#8221; for companies that based their planning on the current tax system.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog">Via Barry Rithotz</a> at <i>The Big Picture</i> comes Bruce Bartlett&#8217;s take on <br />:</div>
<p>
<blockquote><a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2012/11/bruce-bartlett-dangers-of-republican-know-nothingism/">Bruce Bartlett and the dangers of Republican know-nothingism</a> </p>
<p><a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/30/the-real-barrier-to-tax-reform/">Bruce Bartlett</a> goes off on some of the denialist behavior from the GOP. Bartlett writes: When a study doesn’t support their dogma, the GOP censors it: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/02/business/questions-raised-on-withdrawal-of-congressional-research-services-report-on-tax-rates.html">Nonpartisan Tax Report Withdrawn After G.O.P. Protest</a></p>
<p>Original study still available here: <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42729.pdf">Taxes and the Economy: An Economic Analysis of the Top Tax Rates Since 1945</a> (PDF)</p>
<p>Bartlett discussed how Republicans destroyed much of Congress’s analytical ability when they took over in 1995: <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/29/gingrich-and-the-destruction-of-congressional-expertise/">Gingrich and the Destruction of Congressional Expertise</a><br />He adds “This is part and parcel with poll denialism, global warming denialism, and the general right wing disdain for facts and reality.”</p>
<p>Note: Before making any kneejerk partisan reaction to this, note that Bartlett — Like Stockman and others — sre not trying to mske a pro-Democrat argument; rather, they are acknowledging a major societal concern when one of the 2 major political parties have foresaken science and reality and facts when they disagree with their agenda.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Dan here&#8230;I am willing to bet this is a non-partisan issue to some extent and age old way of supporting agendas&#8230;but if data cannot be trusted to have a bit of independence, where does that leave us?)</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/11/tax-policy-you-cant-handle-truth.html">ProGrowthLiberal</a> at <i>Econospeak</i> reminds us of a central <strike>tenet</strike> myth of this electoral campaign, and an example of political pressure on information sources:</p>
<p>Tax Policy: You Can’t Handle the Truth</p>
<p><a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/11/crs-withdraws-study-taxes-growth-mcconnell-hatch.php">Sahil Kapur</a> reports on something that does not surprise me on two levels: <br />
<blockquote>The author of a Congressional Research Service study, who found no evidence that tax cuts for high income earners lead to economic growth, is standing by his work, after the legislative branch’s nonpartisan research arm withdrew the report under pressure from Republican leaders. And Democratic principals are demanding to know why CRS caved to GOP pressure. CRS quietly and quickly pulled the six-week old report, despite the wishes of the research arm’s economic team, the New York Times reported Thursday &#8230; The study, which TPM and others reported on at the time, delved into the last 65 years of U.S. tax policy — specifically how marginal rates on high incomes and capital gains taxes impact decision-making. It concluded that reducing effective taxes on the rich does not generate economic growth, but that it does correlate with rising income inequality in the short term. The report’s conclusions aren’t terribly controversial in mainstream economics.</p></blockquote>
<p>What Thomas Hungerford wrote has indeed been the consensus view among economists who are not prostituting themselves for Mitt Romney&#8230; (More at <i>Econospeak</i>)</p>

<p>In the Vice Presidential debate Ryan said that the Kennedy tax cuts generated so much growth that tax receipts increased enough to offset the revenue losses.</p>
<p>When I look at the data it sure looks like this claim is another one of his Any Rand fantasies.  The economy did grow rapidly after the Kennedy tax cuts,  but the deficit remained high. throughout  the  JFK-LBJ administration.  Moreover, like Reagan, LBJ finally had to raise taxes to recover the lost revenues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I&#8217;m sure you are all feeling kind of blah.  You have this final exam for this session and I can tell by your performances on the quizzes that you are still confused.  The problem solving portions of the quizzes have been very telling.  So lets review.   </div>
<div>  </div>
<div></div>
<div>You&#8217;re taxes are not too high.  It&#8217;s your income that is too low!  Remember this and you will be able to solve enough of the problems to obtain a passing grade and graduate.  And class, no one running today for president gets this.  It is why President Obama looked like such a dufus in the debate.  Romney took a step to his left&#8230; right into Obama&#8217;s policy space.  Where does one go to gain more space when they have walled up the door to the left of them as President Obama has?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s get something real clear from the beginning.  Unless you are acquiring the majority of your money from money  YOU ARE NOT<a href="https://www.google.com/#hl=en&#038;output=search&#038;sclient=psy-ab&#038;q=define+capitalist&#038;oq=define+&#038;gs_l=hp.1.0.35i39j0l3.735.1657.0.3579.7.6.0.0.0.0.219.938.0j5j1.6.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.1.VPyK4hyLvzM&#038;pbx=1&#038;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&#038;fp=f2b10cd80850d317&#038;biw=1024&#038;bih=600" target="_blank"> A CAPITALIST</a> </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Second: A MARKET IS NOT AN ECONOMY.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div></div>
<div>You my fellow students, are citizens living in a particular social structure that can be understood by various groupings of all human interaction that takes place within.  The largest grouping is “society”.    Yes, there is the ultimate grouping known as the human race, but I&#8217;m keeping this discussion and exam limited to the USA society.  (If you pass, you will get to tackle the larger human race grouping in your graduate studies.)  An economy is one such organizational grouping of activity.  A democracy is another.   A “market” is only a labeling of activity.  It is one of many relational activities within an economy and/or a democracy within a society.  An election is another such activity. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, this is very important: THERE IS NO HIEARCHY of the various groupings.  There can&#8217;t be.  It&#8217;s impossible as the groupings are not determinate of life and living.   I will tell you that my physiology professor stated that the determinate of life is a membrane.  So, let&#8217;s get off the “market” kick.  Trust me, “market” will not be an answer on the exam.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>If you are not a citizen capitalist, then you are a citizen laborer.  (These are descriptive labels that are not all inclusive of your potential grouping.)   You are acquiring your money mostly via your labor.  Physical labor, cognitive labor  it does not matter because you are using some ratio of both to acquire your money.  You are expending your labor to your personal level of comfort.  Note, I did not say you are expending your labor to the level of market ability or market possibility.  Your labor does not determine your comfort.  Your labor is not interpretative of your comfort.  It is having obtained your level of desired comfort (comfort as defined by you) that will have determined your labor expended.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Society ultimately determines your value which is based on what society deems of value to it.  Now I know you are thinking I&#8217;ve really put my foot in it here.  I haven&#8217;t.  The market does not determine your value.  The collective of “society” does determine your value and the collective is dynamic though I am not implying any particular velocity of dynamism.  I am not quantifying or qualifying the dynamism.  Elections do the determining.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Now that we are all on the same page, let me repeat myself: YOUR TAXES ARE NOT TOO HIGH.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Your income is too low and no one running for president sees your relationship in this economy in this way.  They don&#8217;t see it because not enough of you see it this way either.  To many are acting as if they are capitalists.  To many are acting as if the market is determinate.  Who the hell is in control here?  YOU or the market?   </div>
<div></div>
<div>So, let me explain your current condition and thus in doing so provide you with what the goal needs to be of any policy (and a focus of your essay) that either of the two presidential candidates propose.  It is working the goal that will allow you to obtain the highest grade on the exam.  Hell, let&#8217;s include the congressional candidates also. They make proposals all the time.  Understand the goal and how you acquire your money and the essay portion (voting) will be a snap.  Original thinking combined with the greatest inclusiveness will get a higher grade.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You are living in the median household.  I know this because, class&#8230; say it with me: I am not a capitalist.   </div>
<div>In 1976 your household had the median income of $12,690.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Using the magic of the <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/m/calculators/uscompare/%20" target="_blank">Measuring Worth</a>site  (it is the  only calculator allowed for your final) your household in 2011 has grown to $52,200.00 based on the skilled labor value.   Notice, we are not using the skilled capitalist value (there is none listed).</div>
<div></div>
<div>Unfortunately for you, the census states that your household actually has only $50,054 of income.  The difference of $2146 is the results of your labor not being valued as much as it was in 1976.  Society has decided that what ever it is you are doing it is not of such value as it was in 1976.  In fact, your value is so little that it did not even keep up with inflation.  How ya feeling about that?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Still thinking it&#8217;s that your taxes are too high?   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Well class, here&#8217;s the real pain: $61,629.00.*   This is the number that you would have if society had just kept the dynamics as they were.   For the sensitive students, unfortunately the ever dynamic society just didn&#8217;t keep the same flaming intensity of love for you as it now cherishes for the capitalist.   Sorry class.  Society has changed.  It values the capitalist more.  Thus, society has changed the economy so that the market activities result in more of the income produced going to the capitalist.  Society did this to you.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Have I made this personal enough for you?  (Remember&#8230;the essay.)   Just in case I haven&#8217;t, recall the earlier part of this review.  You are a part of a collective group called “society”.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s recap:  Society.  You are a part of society.  Society is dynamic.  Elections determine.  You are not a capitalist.  &#8220;Economy&#8221; is a grouping.  &#8220;Market&#8221; is not an answer.  Your taxes are not to high.  Your income is to low.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is the major essay question:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgjfi1DU1mQ" target="_blank">What do you want from life</a>?  I look for original thought and inclusiveness.   Bonus points if you can relate it all to the preamble of the USA societal organizing document.I remove points for facts supported by opinion.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>*As calculated by using the ratio of the share of income for the non capitalist to capitalist  in 1976 to the time period of around now (like today).</div>
<div></div>
<div>$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I have published on this confusion many times.  My <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/01/how-money-is-made-post-by-divorced-one.html" target="_blank">very first post</a> was on this subject.  Most specifically <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/02/more-kissing-income-inequality.htm" target="_blank">here,</a></div>

<p>Which Spending Is Easier To Cut And By What Level Of Government?</p>
<p>Back from his break, our former co-blogger, Dean Baker at Beat the Press, takes down WaPo ed page editor, Fred Hiatt, for his pushing yet again for cutting Social Security because it is supposedly &#8220;easy to do&#8221; in contrast to medical spending, with Hiatt pinning the blame on Dems for not supporting cutting either.  Baker notes that putting med costs in line with those in other countries would alone completely eliminate the federal budget deficit, and that Dems are not the ones opposing cuts to drug companies or &#8220;overpaid medical specialists.&#8221; <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/beat-the-press/why-does-Fred-Hiatt-say-the-democrats-are-opposed-to-giving-less-money-to-drug-companies-and-overpaid-medical-specialists">CEPR</a>   Hiatt barely nods at GOP opposition to tax increases and the possibility of cutting defense spending, even though the US is winding down some of its current active wars.<br />    <br />Dean kindly avoids noting that Hiatt is part of a group of established media mavens in Washington who long ago convinced themselves that somehow not only is Social Security &#8220;in crisis,&#8221; but that somehow it is the easiest program to cut (future) spending on politically, although that will do nearly nothing to limit near-term deficits and that there is nearly zero support among the public of both parties for such an action, and that efforts by various politicians of both parties in recent years to do this have ended up as embarrassing failures.  But this gang does not give up easily, including Hiatt, back at it yet again.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Unfortunately, the alternative appears to be a trick buried in Paul Ryan&#8217;s budget proposal: send certain social safety net programs down to the states, with the leading candidate being Medicaid, which is already partly funded by the states.  As much as any program, this is one that should be solely funded by the feds as that would help even the playing field across states, given that the states that need it the most are the states with the most poor people and thus least able to support their poor people.  But no, Ryan thinks that Medicaid should be sent fully to the states, and some movement in this direction has already happened.<br />      <br />This hypocritical trend of Grover Norquist &#8220;no higher taxes&#8221; politicians sending important programs to lower levels of government so they can claim &#8220;savings&#8221; without tax increases is going on more widely, also reflecting Norquist&#8217;s influence at even state levels.  So, in Virginia where I live, this most recent legislature, newly run fully by the GOP with our GOP governor, has in an effort to balance the state budget without raising taxes or appearing to cut programs, sent an unfunded mandate to the local governments, removing the funding but requiring that they contribute more to teacher pension funds.<br />    <br />This has led to a fairly astounding result, although the mayor or Harrisonburg, where I live, tells me that a lot of these legislators somehow convinced themselves it would not happen.  Nearly every local government in the state, including the vast majority of ones run by Republicans, has raised local taxes, mostly property taxes, but also others as well.  They have been cutting and cutting their budgets for the last several years, something manifesting itself nationally in the steady stream of layoffs at both state and local government levels.  The expectations by citizens for continuing to have basic local public services of some sort simply overrode this idiocy of no new taxes in the face of this unfunded mandate from the state, which in turn at least partly reflects the ongoing rise of Medicaid costs, exacerbated by the feds pushing even more of those down to the states.<br />    <br />As it is, here in Harrisonburg, property taxes are going up, along with a small increase in the rate on restaurant meals.  The alternative to the meals tax rise (much opposed by local restauranteurs) was to raise personal property taxes.  Around the state, different combinations of such increases have been implemented, and it will be interesting to see whether local voters punish their leaders for doing this or will figure it out that they have been pushed to this by the irresponsibility of state politicians.  This problem may well be worse for local Republican leaders than for Dems, given that in general the latter have not hobbled themselves so tightly with all these inane pledges about taxes, although so far, Grover Norquist has not gotten down to the local level guys with making them sign pledges and holding them publicly to them.  There are just too many of them for him to keep track of all of them. <br />Posted by Barkley Rosser at <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2012/06/which-spending-is-easier-to-cut-and-by.html"><abbr>12:40 AM</abbr></a></p>

<blockquote>&#8230; state income and sales taxes, which were quick to decline during the recession, have also improved relatively quickly in the recovery. According to the Census Bureau, state revenues were beginning to improve by the middle of 2010 and continued to rise last year. Rising revenues have meant that at least 25 states, including Kansas, are projected to finish their current fiscal year (ending in June) with a budget surplus, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>Now that states do have a choice about their spending priorities, the question in state legislatures around the country has been, “What to do with the surplus?”</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div><i>First a qualification.  I am basing the following on info I found on the net.  If the info is wrong, then I stand corrected as to who is or is not paying but not as to what happens when a large entity does not pay.   The specific city and company are used purely for example purpose because of familiarity.  What follows could be any municipality with a similar size company calling it home.</i></div>
<div></div>
<div>Lately in the city of my flower shop the big talk is a $10 million deficit in the school department.  It&#8217;s a funny story.  See, the department hired a couple people and these people, along with the help of the city council and the school committee the budget numbers became not real.   They budgeted $59 million but have spent $66.6 million.  The total $10 million is a 2 year deficit. The funny part&#8230;we had a surplus.  Though, where the surplus went to no one knows.  The school committee insists there was no funny business and even voted down an investigation.  So, if there was no funny business, then who gained and what did they gain by covering up a deficit?  What benefit is there about lying about a deficit?  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course, this is also a state funding issue.  You see, the city has the typical city size problems that the surrounding town do not have.  This a<a href="http://www.valleybreeze.com/2012/03/06/nsbw/school-deficit-for-2012-expected-to-exceed-7-million">rticle notes</a>:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>“The committee chair pointed out that Lincoln has a budget of $48 million to educate half the students Woonsocket teaches with a mere $59 million.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;And they don&#8217;t have the special needs we have. They don&#8217;t even have a quarter of the IEPs we deal with,&#8221; she said.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>On top of this, we&#8217;re one of those states that has been passing ALEX  type legislation.  In particular we passed  the one that thinks it is smart of a state to set a cap on how much a municipality can raise taxes in any given year.   The city notes that default is an option, but is currently begging the state legislature to allow a supplemental tax bill.   </div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>I <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/03/divorced-one-like-bush-on-property.html">posted sometime ago</a> on just how dubious the ideas involving tax policy can be. It&#8217;s not as simple as not raising taxes or adding development.  I have <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/tax-cuts-paid-for-with-job-creation.html">also posted </a>on tax breaks and how much it takes in job creation to make up for them.  It&#8217;s basically impossible for job creation to cover the breaks never mind actually producing income greater than the tax break.  This brings us to my flower shop&#8217;s city.  It all comes together in real life for Woonsocket, RI. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Woonsocket has what should be considered a huge resource: CVS/Caremark.  CVS began in Woonsocket.  They love Woonsocket.  It&#8217;s their home. It was (WAS) a wonderful company if you talk to those who worked there sometime before 1990 or so when the founder turned the company over to more professional management as CVS decided to get big.  I&#8217;m certain there are many other towns and cities which have a resource such as CVS/Caremark.   They are assumed to be a benefit to the municipality. .   I&#8217;m also certain these municipalities have experienced the negatives of having such a resource, namely the threat of demise of the municipality if certain privileges are not granted.  These privileges that are “requested” are often in the form of money that will not be paid: tax relief.   After all, an entity such as CVS/Caremark is not considered a resource because it generates money.    It  is because they give the people of the municipality something to do to earn money that entities like CVS/Caremark are a &#8220;resource&#8221;.    The threat is that the resource is &#8216;A&#8217; major or &#8216;the&#8217; major employer of the region.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Some would say the results of tax exemptions are simply good negotiations.  They are contracts.  Are you aware of the phrase: <a href="http://legaldictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Adhesion+Contract">Contracts of Adhesion</a>?</div>
<blockquote><div><i>A type of contract, a legally binding agreement between two parties to do a certain thing, in which one side has all the bargaining power and uses it to write the contract primarily to his or her advantage.</i></div>
</blockquote>
<div>Keep the phrase in mind as you continue reading.  Also keep in mind that good contracts have a performance clause.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This brings us to the issue of Woonsocket&#8217;s deficit.  Some have asked why does CVS not just write a check?  Not a gift, but a check and then offer up it&#8217;s best minds to help prevent this from happening again.  After all, why would a company like CVS want to be in a place that is struggling so much?  Do they not want their environment to reflect their self image?  There is a meme circulating that only 10,000 people pay taxes in Woonsocket.  Some have said it is only 10% of the city&#8217;s population that is paying..  Either way, if that is all that is paying in a municipality of 43,000 people, well then that is the total number of property owners.  Though Woonsocket has a lot of people renting from those 10,000 property owners.  Who is paying the taxes?</div>
<div></div>
<div>This got me wondering.  How much does CVS/Caremark pay in property taxes to the city.  The data which follows was sent to my local newspaper editor.  I received no response.</div>
<div>  </div>
<p>
<div>I found a web site that allows you to look up any tax account in any participating municipality. <a href="http://opaldata.net/ritaxrolls"> RI is here</a>.  I typed in CVS first and came up with accounts related to tangible assets.  A lot of exemptions for those.  We are talking property taxes.  So I looked up <i>1 CVS Drive </i>and got the account that appears to list the actual real estate related to CVS/Caremark corporate operations.  Account number R00-0132-87.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The total assessment for 2011 tax year is $1,149,108.12.   2010 was $1,081,809.76.   For 2009 it was $953,050.27.  The three year total is $3,183,968.15. This is a lot of money.   And all of it was exempted.  The tax bills show $0.00 as total due.  The individual bills state: Adjustment type: 07, tax exempt property.  Based on this data, for the past 3 years, CVS/Caremark or who ever owns the land they sit on has paid nothing.  To make matters worse, using their highest valued property, the assessment was only 2.5%.  My flower shop, as commercial property has an assessment of 3.17%!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ok, so they get a break.  Usually these breaks are in exchange for jobs based on supposedly creating a greater overall income benefit for the tax gifting municipality.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I did some simple calculations as to how many people need to be employed to make up the $1,149,108.12 per year.  Using City-data.com and the 2009 census for Woonsocket, the median household income was $39,964,  the median family income was $48,680, median non-family income was $20,609, the per capita median was $20,627.    For these income ranges, the state&#8217;s income tax rate is 3.75%. Again, doing some simple math (you know I like simple) produced a range of income tax collected of $1825.50 (median family income) to $772.84 (per capita).   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Using income tax is appropriate because if the City is not collecting property taxes in exchange for jobs, then the state income tax is where the money will come from.  This means that the City needs from CVS 630 more family job equivalents than employed in 2011 to make up for the property tax not paid or 1487 more job equivalents median income per capita.   The State of RI has to earmark the income tax it collects  from 630 to 1487 jobs at CVS/Caremark for Woonsocket just to make up for their exemption.  Of course, there is no way a state is going to cut up it&#8217;s collections that way.  I mean, can you imagine what all the other municipalities would do?  Also, we&#8217;re talking job equivalents. A handful of people being paid enough, at 3.75% could do what 1487 jobs do.  Say, a CEO who was paid $29.2 million in compensation for 2010.  Of course, only $1.5 million was “salary”.  The rest was pension and stocks transactions such that by the time the total was rung up the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703806304576233143088595876.html">CEO had $125 million</a> “&#8230;for his final 14 months or so on the job&#8230;” </div>
<div>3.75% of $1.5 million is only $56,250.  Not much, unless you are earning Woonsockets median income. Though 3.75% of $123.5 million is $4,631,250.   To bad it&#8217;s payment via stocks.  I doubt the stock value is treated the same as salary or wages.  Woonsocket and the state lose.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It&#8217;s to bad because those who are paid via wages and thus paying the income tax which has to make up for the property tax not paid by CVS/Caremark means those workers are in actuality giving back part of their earnings to CVS/Caremark.  It&#8217;s their wages that are paying what CVS/Caremark would have paid if not for the exemptions. What a racket.  Of course, there is no specific earmarking to Woonsocket of the income taxes collected via CVS/Caremark jobs.  In fact, the state has changed the formula for distributing money to the towns thus Woonsocket is getting less than it used to get for giving CVS/Caremark property tax exemptions.  That means, those property owners and renters in Woonsocket are primarily carrying the load for CVS/Caremark share.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Tax breaks of any type in exchange for jobs is a fools deal.  It is a devils bargain.  It traps the host municipalities (local or state) and creates a kind of contract of adhesion.  The trap is the “going Galt” threat.   The use of such taxation activity to improve a local economy only leads to the demise of the municipality over time.  There is just no way for one large entity (CVS like entity)  to off load it&#8217;s share of the costs of living onto a smaller entity (43,000 people of a municipality) such that both grow in multiples that produce a greater outcome than had both paid equally based on their income, wealth, use of the commons, etc.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>This is especially critical to understand during the current past decades where wages have been declining relative to inflation.  A decline by the way that entities like CVS have promoted. It is not like the majority of municipalities are full of only 1%&#8217;ers.  When the tax base is declining do to an inability to pay the assessments (this is the true tax base identity not the property values), giving tax breaks as a means to grow to those who&#8217;s incomes have risen as a result of fostering declining overall income to the masses just seems stupid.  Here, let me pay for that knife you are going to stick in me.   Again, what a racket!   </div>

<div>Think about it.  How can an entity that generates $7.944 billion (<a href="http://www.budget.ri.gov/Documents/CurrentFY/ExecutiveSummary/2_Overview.pdf">RI 2013 proposed budget</a>) support an entity that generates a net revenue <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/CVS_Caremark_Corporation_%28CVS%29%20">of $96.4 billion</a> (CVS 2010) via give backs to the larger entity such that the smaller entity will grow?   </div>
<p>Lastly, why do we continue to set policy based on an idea that a company can exist without employees?  Why do we insist on ignoring the obvious, both are needed for a company to live.  Neither one is more important or stands independently.   Of course, the answer is because we let companies threaten and sometime go Galt by pitting one group of citizens against another.  On a larger scale it&#8217;s called outsourcing.</p>
