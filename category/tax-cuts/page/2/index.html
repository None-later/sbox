<p>Senate Dems unveil their tax cut proposal</p>
<p> Senate Democrats, led by majority leader Harry Reid, unveiled a $26 billion tax-cut bill on March 26, 2012. See, e.g., Richard Rubin, Senate Democrats Said to Prepare $26 Billion Tax Cut Measure, San Francisco Chronicle (Mar. 26, 2012).</p>
<p>The proposal revives the lapsed 100% expensing provision for capital investments, extending it through the end of 2012 and would provide a tax credit for businesses that expand their payrolls this year.</p>
<p>The expensing provision is foolish, but it looks like Senate Democrats are more interested in playing the bipartisanship game than they are in good legislation. Why is it foolish? For several reasons.</p>
<p>1) there is already a (temporary) bonus depreciation deduction of 50%.</p>
<p>2) an expensing provision that applies retroactively to already-purchased capital equipment cannot, by definition, have incentivised the purchase of that equipment.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />3) providing this kind of additional break to large corporations is a corporate subsidy that has little to do with creating jobs and nothing to do with good tax policy. It has little to do with creating jobs because corporations will simply accelerate purchases to garner the benefit but may not increase production correspondingly. It has nothing to do with good tax policy because accelerated depreciation already allows deductions faster than economic lossm amounting to yet another pure tax subsidy for businesses.</p>
<p>4) Companies that need to purchase equipment in order to compete will make the appropriate decision to purchase based on company revenues and expenses, without needing a subsidy from the tax code. For businesses where some investment in capital equipment is expected eventually, it is likely that the provision will subsidize an acceleration of an investment that would have been done anyway, amounting to a mis-allocation of resources to garner the extra tax break, while temporarily available.</p>
<p>The subsidy for payroll expansion is at least more directly connected to a desired social goal of creating more jobs to reduce the unemployment problem and something that both small and large businesses can benefit from. The proposal calls for a 10% tax credit for the first $5 million of payroll expansion in 2012, capped at half a million. Payroll expansion can be either new hires or wage increases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the GOP-led House is planning about double that amount as an outright giveaway to business. Cantor sponsored a 20% tax cut for all businesses with fewer than 500 workers. Those businesses are not necessarily &#8220;small&#8221; and the provision is not linked to payroll expansion, as Schumer noted. Id.</p>

<div>A while ago (an understatement) I posted on the question of what is rich. The <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/04/define-rich.html">first dealt</a> with what issues to consider in defining rich. The <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/05/define-rich-part-ii-rat-race-and.html">second</a> was looking at the issue of getting rich if that is even what one wants to do. The “rat race”. I don&#8217;t believe most people really want to be rich. I believe most people when thinking about being rich are thinking about what it would take to remove the fears of events that would make one&#8217;s life either very difficult in a world that requires money to remove risk or drastically different from what one&#8217;s life was. I&#8217;m thinking things like losing a job, debilitating injury or illness possibly resulting in physical disability or Louis Winthorpe III. </div>
<div></div>
<div>This all ties into “The American Dream”. The “Dream” is not just an ideology of governance and social philosophy. It is also a life style and thus requires a specific level of income. I have posted on this issue also and noted just how high in income we have driven this “Dream” such that two people with bachelor’s degrees just starting life together may not be able to have it. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Now that we have entered a period where taxes are on everyone&#8217;s minds such that there is serious consensus to raising taxes, maybe we need to see what we had in the past to know what we need now. I am sure most readers are aware of Mike&#8217;s work defining what rates appear to effect economic growth the best. If I recall correctly the number for the top 1% was around 65%. I have also suggested that there is a range as to how large a share of the income the top 1% should have. That number for the top 1% is not to be above 15% and not to much below 10%. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I should also <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/opus-1-discussion-on-taxation.html">mention my postings</a> on <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/01/opus-1-second-movement-on-taxation.html">taxation’s purpose</a>. Specifically I looked at taxing from the perspective of the legal profession as oppose to the economic profession. The conclusion was that there was one main reason for taxing. It is to fulfill the directive of our constitution: equality of power. It is to assure the concept of one voice one vote. If there was ever a time in our history to raise taxes in order to assure this directive it is now in the age of the Citizens United ruling. President FDR referred to the issue and those with the one voice multiple votes do to their monied power as “economic royalty”. I like that phrase and I wonder why it is not used as are retort to those who use “class warfare” as a guilt trip.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s get started.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />I have constructed 4 sets of data using the tax rates of 1936/37, 1945/46, 1965/67 and 2010. I chose 1936 because it is a tax rate increase after the economy had turned north based on Mikes posting. I chose 1945/46 because it is another adjustment that happens right after after WWII. I chose 1965/67 because it is the decrease often spoken of fondly. Of course 2010 is because that is where we are at. 
<div></div>
<div>This posting would be hugely long if I post on all 4 periods at once, so I have broken it up. Let me first and I think most importantly note that we people today have no idea just how much we were willing to tax ourselves to have the society that we now refer to as “the good old days”. Not only did we have the tax tables of 1936, that table eventually had a 10% surcharge added to pay for the war. Yes, another reason to consider the generation that fought the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> world wars the greatest generation. There was a 7% surcharge for the Vietnam war, though that number became less as time passed. Still, we knew that if we wanted to do exceptional things, we had to tax ourselves exceptionally. Also, the early taxation made no distinction for single or married, never mind filing joint or separate. Everyone paid the same rate. Most interestingly, with the current table, the people who comparatively get screwed are those who are married and file separately. All the rates kick in at a lower income than even those who are single. The other thing we don&#8217;t seem to understand is that all the tax rhetoric we have been hearing since Reagan <a href="http://taxhistory.tax.org/www/website.nsf/Web/THM1901?OpenDocument">we&#8217;ve heard before virtually to the word.</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>Andrew Mellon, Treasury Secretary 1921 to 1932 :</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Generally speaking, Mellon argued that tax burdens were too high. Steep rates, he insisted, served only to stifle incentive and foster tax evasion. “Any man of energy and initiative in this country can get what he wants out of life,” he wrote. <em>“But when initiative is crippled by legislation or by a tax system which denies him the right to receive a reasonable share of his earnings, then he will no longer exert himself and the country will be deprived of the energy on which its continued greatness depends.”</em></div>
<div></div>
<div>Worse yet, Mellon argued, high rates didn’t even raise money. By encouraging both legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion, they eroded the tax base and reduced overall revenue. <em>Lower rates, he said, would actually raise money by spurring economic growth and reducing the incentive for tax avoidance. “It seems difficult for some to understand,” he complained, “that high rates of taxation do not necessarily mean large revenue to the government, and that more revenue may actually be obtained by lower rates.”</em> In particular, Mellon insisted that high rates distorted investment decisions, boosting the popularity of tax-free state and local government bonds. Indeed, Mellon made these tax-free bonds a regular target of his reform attempts, but Congress resisted his plans to eliminate them.</div>

<div></div>
<div>Atlas Shrugged wasn&#8217;t even written then!  What we don&#8217;t hear much of are the original concerns and reasoning for progressive taxation. Teddy Roosevelt:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>1906&#8230;<strong>We should discriminate in the sharpest way between fortunes well-won and fortunes ill-won; between those gained as an incident to performing great services to the community as a whole, and those gained in evil fashion by keeping just within the limits of mere law-honesty.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>1907 regarding an income tax:&#8230;while in addition it is a difficult tax to administer in its practical working, and great care would have to be exercised to see that it was not evaded by the very men whom it was most desirable to have taxed, for if so evaded it would, of course, be worse than no tax at all; <strong>as the least desirable of all taxes is the tax which bears heavily upon the honest as compared with the dishonest man. </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div><strong>No advantage comes either to the country as a whole or to the individuals inheriting the money by permitting the transmission in their entirety of the enormous fortunes which would be affected by such a tax; and as an incident to its function of revenue raising, such a tax would help to preserve a measurable equality of opportunity for the people of the generations growing to manhood.</strong> We have not the slightest sympathy with that socialistic idea which would try to put laziness, thriftlessness and inefficiency on a par with industry, thrift and efficiency; which would strive to break up not merely private property, but what is far more important, the home, the chief prop upon which our whole civilization stands. Such a theory, if ever adopted, would mean the ruin of the entire country&#8211;a ruin  which would bear heaviest upon the weakest, upon those least able to shift for themselves.</div>
</blockquote>

<div></div>
<div>At this moment, I want to mention corporate taxes. There are lessons to be learned from it&#8217;s history. I think it is a factor in understand more completely the issue Mike is focusing on: taxation and GDP growth. <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=203">Wrap your minds around the fact</a> that from 1936 to 1943 there were 6 years that corporate tax collections were greater than personal income tax collections. 1943 was the best year for this as personal income tax collections were 68.1% of the corporate tax collections. Just one year later it flips to corporate tax collections being 75.3% of personal income tax collections. In 1944 $34,543 million in total for the two taxes was collected vs 1943 $16,062 million in total.  <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=204">In fact, personal income taxes</a> remain in the mid to high 40 percent of total revenue collections from 1944 to present. The corporate share of total revenue peaks in 1943 at 39.8% and declines to hover around the 10% level with a few ventures into the single digits. Most notably 1983 the corporate share was 6.2% and 2009 it was 6.6%. </div>
<div>First up is our current tax table. I used the “married filling jointly” as that would be consistent with the other tables. One big rule of this series of postings: DO NOT concern yourself or me about the deductions that exist. They do not matter for this presentation and for all intent and purposes we can consider the income to have already gone through the deduction calculator and is now ready to have the tax table applied. This is because, these tables only apply to adjusted gross income.</div>

<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lX4293efG5Y/Tl_Efh3ab1I/AAAAAAAAARc/W7X0lIr0Ki0/s1600/2010+Tax+table+Define+Rich+3.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="211" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lX4293efG5Y/Tl_Efh3ab1I/AAAAAAAAARc/W7X0lIr0Ki0/s320/2010+Tax+table+Define+Rich+3.JPG" width="320" xaa="true"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>You will notice that the table is calculated out to $,1,000,000 of income. I did this in order to keep all the tables going to the same income level. The 1936 table actually has rates for incomes up to $8 million. That is $8 million in 1936. (Using my <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/compare/">favorite money converter</a> that would be $301,000,000 in unskilled labor or $573,000,000 in GDP/capita.) Going to $1,000,000 in income also allows one to see what happens at the top when the rate no longer rises. </div>
<div></div>
<div>A very important concept to understand is that not every dollar is taxed at the single percentage rate as you go up the income ladder. Thus, there are two columns in my charts. The “Marginal Tax” is the additional money paid at the top of the bracket for the corresponding rate. The “Total tax” is the actual money paid up to that level. It is the “effective rate”. In simple terms, if you are at the 35% level, you  </div>
<div>are not paying 35% on all that you earn. Instead you are paying the amount based on your income being divided up into the number of brackets that exist. For 2010, there are 6 brackets, thus you have six different incomes so to speak. </div>
<div></div>
<div>This is what it looks like as a graph.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OCqtKMLzE3A/Tl_Ejt_NFtI/AAAAAAAAARg/bwU8IixjaGc/s1600/2010+Tax+rate+graph+Define+Rich+3.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OCqtKMLzE3A/Tl_Ejt_NFtI/AAAAAAAAARg/bwU8IixjaGc/s320/2010+Tax+rate+graph+Define+Rich+3.JPG" width="320" xaa="true"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>When the rate maxed out, I divided the range to $1 million into even parts so that the tax paid for each additional income level is the same. For the 1945/46 and 1965/67 data sets I converted the net income to 2010 dollars. I used the “unskilled labor” and GDP/cap as those are the 2 factors suggested as being the best for knowing what income equivalents are over time. The 1936 data set is converted to 1967 dollar because the numbers just get crazy. For example, a net income of $3840 is $145,000 in unskilled labor and $275,000 in GDP/cap. Though it is only $60,400 via the CPI. Which doesn&#8217;t say much for today&#8217;s median family income. It also gives us a clue as to just how much money is considered “rich”.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Next posting, I will start presenting the historical data sets. I&#8217;m still thinking about the best way to do it as what is important is the comparison among the data sets.  Maybe post just the data charts and later the graphs or maybe one data set and it&#8217;s graphs at a time.  </div>

(h/t Stormy)</p>
<p><strong>Corporations pushing for job-creation tax breaks shield U.S.-vs.-abroad hiring data</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>Some of the country’s best-known multi­national corporations closely guard a number they don’t want anyone to know: the breakdown between their jobs here and abroad.</p>
<p>So secretive are these companies that they hand the figure over to government statisticians on the condition that officials will release only an aggregate number. The latest data show that multinationals cut 2.9 million jobs in the United States and added 2.4 million overseas between 2000 and 2009.</p>
<p>Some of the same companies that do not report their jobs breakdown, including <a href="http://washpost.bloomberg.com/marketnews/stockdetail/?symbol=AAPL">Apple</a> and <a href="http://washpost.bloomberg.com/marketnews/stockdetail/?symbol=PFE">Pfizer</a>, are pushing lawmakers to cut their tax bills in the name of job creation in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<br />Apple, by the way, is at the top or close to the top, in recent profits. GE has deceased its per centage of US workers from 54% to 46% in the last decade. Few contenders in the presidentail elections or Congressional elections make this notion a part of their campaigns. The debate in regular media usually stops at words like &#8216;protectionism&#8217;. The next time you read about tax cut money flowing to create jobs, hold in mind global trade demands that companies actually respond to, and do not think US jobs are a priority. The rhetoric merely implies a vague ideal&#8230;not company policies.</p>
<p>Perhaps multi-national companies need to be lean and mean to thrive, and raising the overall living standards of the world has trememdous benefits for people in general, and of course some problems that go with it. Just don&#8217;t think that election political rhetoric has US public benefit in mind overall as a priority high on the list.</p>

<div>(This is a long post.  The time for sound bite debate to the demise of learned discussion is over for we are flirting with danger.)  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Via a post at<a href="http://www.financialarmageddon.com/2011/08/hand-in-hand.html"> Financial Armageddon</a> I learnt of a paper looking at the relationship of austerity implementation and social unrest.  It is recent, dated August 2011.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/file/DP8513.pdf">Austerity and Anarchy: Budget Cuts and Social Unrest in Europe</a>, 1919-2009 </div>
<div>Jacopo Ponticelli, Universitat Pompeu Fabra</div>
<div>Hans-Joachim Voth, UPF-ICREA, CREI and CEPR</div>
<div>Discussion Paper No. 8513</div>
<div>August 2011</div>
<div>Centre for Economic Policy Research</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Financial Armageddon article shows the first chart of the paper which presents:<i>  the relationship between fiscal adjustment episodes and the number of incidents indicating instability (CHAOS).</i></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>  </div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_v1RnWfwQQw/TkqWMx894MI/AAAAAAAAARY/APzmU3rfTak/s1600/Austerity+vs+Instability+chart+8-15-11.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_v1RnWfwQQw/TkqWMx894MI/AAAAAAAAARY/APzmU3rfTak/s320/Austerity+vs+Instability+chart+8-15-11.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>  </div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;CHAOS is the sum of demonstrations, riots, strikes, assassinations, and attempted revolutions in a</div>
<div>single year in each country. The first set of five bars show the frequencies conditional on the size of budget cuts. When expenditure is increasing, the average country-year unit of observation in our data registers less than 1.5 events. When expenditure cuts reach 1% or more of GDP, this grows to nearly 2 events, a relative increase by almost a third compared to the periods of budget expansion. As cuts intensify, the frequency of disturbances rises. Once austerity measures involve expenditure reductions by 5% or more, there are more than 3 events per year and country &#8212; twice as many as in times of expenditure increases.&#8221;  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>This is a rather disturbing chart.  Certainly the recent events in England play into the subject of this paper.   That WE are now setup for our version of austerity implementation, this paper should be put in the hands of all the staff members of congress and the president.   If I had my own national news show I would have in the corner of the screen the above chart along with the google map of all the riot locations in London and in big letters: Cut SS, MC, Medicaid.  Really? You want to go there?</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is more to this paper than just the apparent connection between austerity and upheaval.<i>  &#8220;Controlling for economic growth does not change our results. This suggests that we capture more than the general association between economic downturns and unrest.&#8221;</i></div>
<div></div>
<div>This is the most powerful statement of the paper.  It implies that &#8220;Man&#8221; in all his glory is responsible for such social activity.  It is not the<a href="http://draft.blogger.com/.%20http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/big-washington-consensus-lie-by-david.html"> &#8220;natural&#8221; course</a> of economic activity that creates such volatile activity.  It is the<a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/big-washington-consensus-lie-by-david.html"> economic policy implemented</a>that determines whether there will be unrest or not.  Currently, the proposed austerity is based on an a priori of &#8220;we&#8217;re broke&#8221;.  It is stated with the authority of natural cause.  Mother Nature Economy did it&#8217;s thing and well&#8230;we&#8217;re broke.  All we can do is rebuild after the storm.   Yet, an economy is totally of human design.  The republican who stated that the conservative movement was making reality was more correct than their fantasizing of control and power would allow them to realize.  Thus I delve into this paper more after the jump.  </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<hr xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">  
<div>There are two points that need to be understood if we are to apply the lessons of this social economic paper.  Point 1:</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;However, countries with very high levels of constraints on the executive show a weaker degree of association&#8230;Table 10 demonstrates that in countries with better institutions, the responsiveness of unrest to budget cuts is generally lower. Where constraints on the executive are minimal, the coefficient on expenditure changes is strongly negative – more spending buys a lot of social peace.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>So, some kind of governance that includes self determination is a mechanism for minimizing upheaval/unrest.  I believe the American Revolution would be an example of upheaval in the face of “minimal executive” constraint.  Finding that constraint of the executive is determinative does not mean such rights are exercised by the people to their benefit:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;The political economy literature on austerity suggests a paradox. There is no significant punishment at the polls for governments pursuing cut-backs (Alesina, Perotti, and Tavares 1998; Alesina, Carloni, and Lecce 2010), and no evidence of gains in response to budget expansion (Brender and A. Drazen</div>
<div>2008).&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I don&#8217;t know what to make of such findings.  Certainly there must be more in the details of the studies sited.  If such lack of response by the electorate is true, then we are in deeper trouble than realized.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Based on this conclusion, the authors ask: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;Why, then, is fiscal consolidation often delayed, or only implemented half-heartedly?&#8221; </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>They suggest fear of unrest may be the reason and footnote the following: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>14 Alesina, Carloni and Lecce (2010) also suggest that implementation of budget measures may be harder if the burden falls disproportionately on some groups.  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I would hate to think that austerity measures are not implemented simply because of fear of a reprisal that appears to be short lived with no political loss to those implementing the policy  instead of not implementing austerity because research and experience prove it to be actually harmful in it&#8217;s results and even contradictory to the desired outcome of greater prosperity with reduced risk of living.  If the politico is acting based on the former, it show&#8217;s no conviction of ideology and philosophy.  If they fail to acted based on the latter, it shows a lack of character of inquiry and enlightenment.   In either case, Naomi Kline&#8217;s work notes that austerity is always implemented with some form of force.  In our country the force appears to be consolidation and control of the media combined with massive amounts of spending thus control of the debate and knowledge of the subject matter.  Though the police state is in place thanks to Bush/Cheney and the expansion under Obama. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Point 2:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>“Further, we examine if the spread of mass media changes the probability of unrest. This is not the case. If anything, higher levels of media availability and a more developed telecommunications infrastructure reduce the strength of the mapping from budget cuts to instability.&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>In their conclusion they flatly state: <i>Contrary to what might be expected, we also find no evidence that the spread of mass media facilitates the rise of mass protests.   </i></div>
<div></div>
<div>This suggests that cutting communications as some have done recently in an attempt to curb the upheaval is not a procedure that works in the long term.  The focus of the complaint, materialized via upheaval will have to be addressed.  It is not the ease of rallying the masses, the pep squad going viral that solely explains the materialization or degree of unrest.  Though it may explain the reduction in strength of austerity implementation and resulting upheaval.  I think the authors have stumbled upon the modern version of the printing press coming into existence and the effects it had.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The authors review current literature on the subject and find there is some confliction as to the effects of budget cutting.  I&#8217;ll let you read it, but my take home is that it depends on what stage of national development the country is in as to the extent  austerity will produce unrest, if the unrest is sustained post implementation and whether it promotes growth.  They even site:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Giavazzi and Pagano (1990) and Alesina et al. (2002) find that cuts can be expansionary. Amongst the reasons suggested for this finding are a reduction in uncertainty about the course future spending (Blanchard 1990a), and a positive wealth shock as a result of lower taxes in the future (Bertola and Drazen 1993).3  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I guess we know where the current meme comes from.  Unfortunately the authors also note:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>IMF interventions, on the other hand, often led to more frequent disturbances (Morrison, Lafay, and Dessus 1994).</div>
<div>Similarly, Haggard, Lafay and Morrison (1995) find that IMF interventions and monetary contractions in developing countries led to greater instability.</div>
<div>Recently, work by the IMF has suggested that austerity measures may be less expansionary than previously thought; they may well have the standard negative Keynesian effects as a result of lower demand (IMF 2010; Pescatori, Leigh, and Guajardo 2011).</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Oh no!  What is the IMF going to do now?  I&#8217;m still praying for you Greece.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>The author&#8217;s sum up the literature review with:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div><u>Remarkably, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no systematic analysis of how budget cuts affect the level of social instability and unrest in a broad cross-section of developed countries, over a long period.</u></div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Wouldn&#8217;t you think that such research would be considered key to one&#8217;s knowledge base before we start implementing policy that to date has been mostly tried and studied in 3rd world situations?   Wouldn&#8217;t you think that the advising  </div>
<div>the proof of effectiveness from these advising economist?  Even medicine has acknowledged there is a difference between men and women other than genital development.  The review of literature is clear.  Start cutting and you will piss people off such that they express it ultimately in violent means though if you can ride it out the violence abates and prosperity looms until it doesn&#8217;t because people just plain have no money.  The word for today is: Demand.  Use it in a sentence as it relates to this discussion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We can think that there are other issues involved when people protest, but the authors make it clear, austerity brings out the greatest number of people.  For those considering how to handle the masses when the austerity gets implemented:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;The simple correlations suggest that these co-movements do not extend to all indicators of unrest equally – riots, revolutions, and demonstrations decline as expenditure rises, but assassinations and strikes seem – at a first pass – uncorrelated. Similarly, output growth seems to correlate negatively with assassinations, riots, revolutions, and demonstrations, but not with strikes.&#8221; </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>And: &#8220;This suggests that unrest reacts particularly strongly to budget cuts and growth when unrest levels are already high.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Go ahead, implement at your own imperil.  In case you think this connection of unrest/upheaval is related to how they measure it, the authors checked that variable: <i>&#8220;We conclude that the way in which we measure unrest does not matter for our main finding.&#8221;</i></div>
<div></div>
<div>Looking at the relationship of austerity policy involving taxes: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Higher taxes and lower expenditure are associated with more unrest, but the relationship is not significant.  Tax increases have a positive sign, but the effect is not significant at standard levels of rejection (column 2). It is also small – a one standard deviation rise in the tax/GDP ratio increases unrest by less than 0.01 events. Overall, we find that improvements in the budget balance raise the level of unrest (column 3). As the results in columns (1) and (2) make clear, this reflects the impact of expenditure cuts, <i><u>and not of tax increases.</u></i></div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>And:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>We find the same results as before – expenditure cuts wreak havoc, tax increases do so only to a small extent and insignificantly. Overall, the budget balance matters for predicting unrest.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Just to make sure no one gets this wrong:  A change in budget balance predicts unrest if the balance is reduced via cuts.  Kind of makes it difficult to accept that the masses want something for nothing.  In fact, I would suggest “entitlement” as it has come to mean something for nothing is the wrong word to apply to government programs of which people pay for willingly via taxes and don&#8217;t get riotous if they are asked to pay more.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If we wanted to avoid the upheaval of austerity implementation we should consider: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>In all specifications, the effect of GDP growth on unrest is negative. In contrast to the results for expenditure changes, the effect is not tightly estimated, except in the case of demonstrations, when it is also large – every 1% increase in GDP cuts the number of demonstrations by close to 0.4 events.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>See, do something that actually improves the economy and people don&#8217;t protest!  Wow, who&#8217;d a thunk it?  Of course improving the economy such that people do not protest would mean having implemented something which produces an actually experienced improvement in the peoples lives.  Something like real rising wages paralleling productivity rise and thus rising wealth.  Unlike say, debt driven consumption only to have financing go away and then told to suck it up.</div>
<div></div>
<div>They look further at the connection of spending cuts vs economic growth and find:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>In contrast, if expenditure changes are negative, they matter a great deal for unrest, driving up CHAOS by 0.19 incidents for each standard deviation of expenditure cuts. Next, we repeat the exercise for output changes. Increases in output do much to cut unrest (col. 3), with a one standard deviation increase in output (3.77%) reducing CHAOS by 0.2 incidents on average. In contrast, declines do not set off major disruptions to the same degree. Overall, the results in table 12 confirm that the relevant identifying variation for expenditure changes comes from cuts; for output changes, it comes from positive growth, not recessions.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This  paper kind of makes you think about our current governance of Wall Street/Corp influence and apparent dominance of policy choices to the exclusion of polls showing people want no cuts in programs referred to as entitlements and instead have the budget balanced via tax revenue enhancement.  Wonder what happens when virtual people known as corporations do not experience austerity yet have persuading influence over We the people&#8217;s choices via money into the election process.? I guess we are going to find out.  As I have heard in the past: tort is the free market response to lax governance of the market.  Is upheaval the same free market response to unresponsive policy toward the people?</div>
<div></div>
<div>My concern is that the initial response by those supporting and promoting austerity will be the furthering of the police state we have been developing since 9/11.  Only it will also be fired up (pun intended) domestically.  It is the response we have experienced in the past with the civil rights motion and even back to the labor movement.  It appears that a police response is always the first response to protest as protest is interpreted as potentially criminal regardless of what the Constitution reads.  Yet here we have a paper suggesting that all of it can be avoided.  Combining this paper with the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html">2005 World Bank report </a>on what creates wealth in a developed economy it appears to me that we have  in our hands the answer to what appropriate economic policy should look like for our current situation.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>I asked <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/can-we-please-broaden-our-thinking-in.html">September 2008</a> if we could please broaden our discussion regarding the crisis.  That has not happened.  The discussion is still disjointed, segmented and narrow.  Now I&#8217;m imploring that we broaden the discussion.  Pleading! </div>

<p><strong>A Post:  Tax Burdens, Presidents, and Subsequent Economic Growth &#8211; A Few Pictures, Part 1</strong></p>
<p>Last week I had a post looking at the relationship between <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/presidents-tax-burdens-and-subsequent.html">the change in the tax burden in the first two years of a Presidential administration and the growth of real GDP during the remaining years of the administration</a>.  I&#8217;ve done variations of this exercise before.  It turns out that the more an administration reduced the tax burden in its first two years, the slower the growth the in real GDP over the remainder of its term in office administration.  Assuming the result is more than an artifact of the data (and it does seem to correspond with other results I&#8217;ve reported here over the years), it requires an explanation.  While (I am not happy to report) an increased tax burden <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/simple-explanation-for-strange-paradox.html">might in and of itself stimulate faster economic growth</a>, I suspect a bigger effect is that a) the easiest way to move the tax burden is by increasing or decreasing tax regulation and b) there is a correlation between an administration&#8217;s views on tax regulations and its views on other regulations that are intended to prevent externalities.   This theory is supported by the fact that the relationship between lower tax burdens and slower growth is strengthened by not including the administrations that served only four rather than eight years makes the relationship stronger.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As I keep noting, one doesn&#8217;t have to like the results.  I personally would much prefer a world in which lower tax burdens do lead to faster economic growth.  But the data doesn&#8217;t seem to show that.  Still, every time I put up a post like this, I get a lot of flack.  One thing people keep telling me is that the results are, at best, a coincidence.  In their honor, in today&#8217;s post I&#8217;m going to describe a few more coincidences that the data shows in my next few posts.  Some of these coincidences I expected to see, and some, to be frank, I did not.  Today I&#8217;m going to stick with a few coincidences I expected.</p>
<p>So&#8230;  let&#8217;s go with coincidence number one. The graph below shows the change in the tax burden from Year 0 (i.e., the last full year of the prior administration) to Year 2 on one axis, and the growth rate in the last full year of each administration.  (Only eight year administrations are included.)  As an example, for Ronald Reagan, we see the change in the tax burden from 1980 to 1982 along one axis and the percentage change from the 1987 real GDP to the 1988 real GDP.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7RNRhtKqqLc/ThrMTwrhaBI/AAAAAAAAAqU/fqqQYQet0G4/s1600/Follow-up_figure_1.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7RNRhtKqqLc/ThrMTwrhaBI/AAAAAAAAAqU/fqqQYQet0G4/s320/Follow-up_figure_1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 1</p>
<p>Notice that the relationship between the tax burden in the first two years of each administration and the growth rate in its last year is extremely strong.  That&#8217;s consistent with what I wrote in my last post (and so many times before):  most administrations do not change their tax policy very much, but tax policy (and other policies that correlate with tax policy) can take a while to have an effect on the economy. </p>
<p>Before I go on, a few ground rules for those who want to comment or send me e-mail: <br />1.  If you really believe that the growth rate in the last year of an administration is &#8220;causing&#8221; the change in the tax burden in the beginning of the administration, I encourage you to seek psychiatric help.  I can&#8217;t do anything for you.<br />2.  US&#8217; participation in World War 2 prior to 1940 is best described as peripheral.  Growth in 1940, or 1939, or 1934 for that matter, is not due to World War 2.  </p>
<p>(If you find my constant repetition of these ground rules funny, hazard a guess as to what creeps into my inbox.)  </p>
<p>Now, another coincidence&#8230;  the next figure shows the the change in the tax burden from Year 0 (i.e., the last full year of the prior administration) to Year 2 on one axis, and the growth rate in the fourth year of each administration. </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xfHijDM1urw/ThrMTwNv-zI/AAAAAAAAAqc/CKJJTyPT0Js/s1600/Follow-up_figure_2_-_corrected.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xfHijDM1urw/ThrMTwNv-zI/AAAAAAAAAqc/CKJJTyPT0Js/s320/Follow-up_figure_2_-_corrected.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2</p>
<p>Again&#8230; the picture looks an awful like Figure 1.  The fit isn&#8217;t as good (consistent with the idea that it takes a while for policy to have a a very strong effect.  Kind of odd for a coincidence.</p>
<p>Now&#8230; you may be wondering&#8230; what about other years.  I&#8217;ll tell you flat out, the fits in years 1 and 2 are awful&#8230; consistent with the idea that it takes a while for policy to have a very strong effect.  As to the rest, that will wait for the next post.</p>
<p>To close, nominal and real GDP come from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>.  GDP was first computed in 1929, so the first complete administration for which we have data is FDR I.  Data on the Federal government&#8217;s tax receipts comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S3">NIPA Table 3.2</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Presidents, Tax Burdens, and the Subsequent Economic Growth</strong></p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve posted variations of the graph below a few times:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JHTw3sdoX7E/ThGrKkY5DxI/AAAAAAAAAp0/w2tJLA_w64A/s1600/kimel1.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JHTw3sdoX7E/ThGrKkY5DxI/AAAAAAAAAp0/w2tJLA_w64A/s320/kimel1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>The graph shows the change in the tax burden (i.e., current federal receipts / GDP) from the year before an administration took office to its second year in office on one axis, and the annualized growth in real GDP from its second year to its last year in office on the other axis.  So, to use GW as an example, the graph shows the change in Federal Receipts / GDP from 2000 to 2002 on one axis and the growth rate in real GDP from 2002 to 2008 on the other axis. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>JFK and LBJ are bunched together because LBJ took over during JFK&#8217;s term, and the two together served eight years.  Ditto Nixon/Ford.  Truman, on the other hand, took over less than three months into FDR&#8217;s fourth term, and then served just shy of eight years on his own.  I figured that was enough to qualify as Truman&#8217;s own administration.  FDR&#8217;s 12 years in office are broken into two administrations:  through 1940, and 1941 &#8211; 1944.  1941-1944, being the World War 2 years, are sufficiently different in terms of focus and goals to qualify as a different administration.</p>
<p>The graph is rather busy.  Removing the names of the Presidents (I&#8217;ve left 3 for which reasons which will become evident later), and using Excel to add a trendline may make things a bit more clear.  </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oI_tjYcyse0/ThGrk7C7C8I/AAAAAAAAAp8/ik0t41C6R6Y/s1600/kimel2.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oI_tjYcyse0/ThGrk7C7C8I/AAAAAAAAAp8/ik0t41C6R6Y/s320/kimel2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>The graph makes a point that would be controversial if people were aware of it, namely that in general, the more an administration reduced tax collections during its first two years in office, the faster the growth rate during its remaining years in office. (Rdan&#8230;One word correction)</p>
<p>This result contradicts the beliefs of most people who have taken an economics course in this country, and anyone who listens to Rush Limbaugh or watches Fox News.  But the fit is surprisingly tight considering how few variables are involved.  It doesn&#8217;t matter who believes it, or whether we are happy with this result.  I personally would much prefer to see lower taxes leading to faster economic growth than slower economic growth, but reality is what it is, not what we want it to be. </p>
<p>Now, if this is true, how does it work?  Well, it could be that changes in the tax burden in years 0 to 2 economic growth in later years.  (That isn&#8217;t controversial, even if the direction that the data is.)  But I suspect there is more at stake.  The tax burden often moves, sometimes by quite a bit, even when there has been no change in marginal tax rates.  I think a lot of the change has to do with regulation and enforcement.  An administration that cuts tax burdens is reducing regulatory tax burdens and perhaps cutting enforcement, and not just at the IRS.  A big part of that has to do with the ideology of the administration, which in turn affects who it places in key positions.  The people GW brought into his administration are very different from the people FDR selected.  And a tiger doesn&#8217;t change its stripes&#8230; an administration staffed by people who believe in reducing regulation in year 1 is going to be staffed by people who believe in reducing regulation in year 7.</p>
<p>Sadly, I now have to repeat something that keeps coming up every time I make this point.   I get comments and/or e-mails and/or even people telling me in person that what is happening is that slower growth is leading to lower tax collections.  Returning to the GW illustration, if you really believe that mediocre growth from 2002 to 2008 caused the reduction in tax burdens from 2000 to 2002,  you may have what it takes to write for the National Review or the Heritage Foundation.  I&#8217;m not impressed by arguments based on time travel, nor am I in a position to hire.  </p>
<p>Before we go on, some housecleaning.  Nominal and real GDP come from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>.  GDP was first computed in 1929, so the first complete administration for which we have data is FDR I.  Data on the Federal government&#8217;s tax receipts comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S3">NIPA Table 3.2</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to indicating that the administrations that produced faster growth tended to be the ones that started off by raising tax burdens, the graphs tells us a few things.  Many of these things are about the media and the education system in this country, as what the data shows tends to be a surprise to most people.  The fastest growth occurred during World War 2, which is also when the economy could best be described as a command economy.  (Think tax rates above 90%, rationing, government directives, etc.)  The years from 1932 &#8211; 1940, widely perceived as being a period of slow growth, actually had the fastest peace time growth for any period for which we have data.  (The economic collapse of the Great Depression occurred before FDR took office.)  </p>
<p>But is this all an anomaly?  Some artifact of the data?   Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t think so.  See, the graphs provide a bit of evidence that indicates the theory is actually more robust than it looks.  Consider the following reasonable assumptions:</p>
<p>1.  changes in the tax burden are indicative of behavior of the administration<br />2.  the sorts of policies and behavior that affect of the economy don&#8217;t change over the length of an administration (i.e., the tiger doesn&#8217;t change its stripes)<br />3.  the economy is affected by more than just the current administration&#8217;s behavior<br />4.  some policies can take a while to have an effect</p>
<p>Assuming all of that, one would think that the longer an administration was in office, the more likely it is that its growth would tend toward what &#8220;it should be&#8221; given its policies.  Put another way, the biggest outliers should be the four year administrations.  A glance at Figure 2 tells you immediately that this is, indeed, the case.  FDR&#8217;s WW2 years, Bush 1, and Carter are the outliers.  And eliminating those outliers and focusing exclusively on the eight year administrations does, indeed, strengthen the model, as theory would suggest:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YpL7H9A1tUU/ThGsr8LGvAI/AAAAAAAAAqM/vplYVpAhD2Q/s1600/kimel3.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YpL7H9A1tUU/ThGsr8LGvAI/AAAAAAAAAqM/vplYVpAhD2Q/s320/kimel3.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.  </p>
<p>So what we&#8217;re left is increasing evidence that the more an administration cuts the tax burden in its first two years in office, the slower the growth it produces thenceforth.  And again, you don&#8217;t have to like this result (I personally don&#8217;t) for it to be true.  </p>
<p>All of which brings us back to Barack Obama, who is not on any of these graphs.  Now, Obama inherited an economic disaster, but that&#8217;s the past.  He campaigned for the right to be the one making the decisions, and he got it.  And what matters is whether he makes things better.  FDR inherited a much worse economic mess, and went on to produce growth the likes of which haven&#8217;t seen since.  So&#8230; any chance Obama is going to pull an FDR?  In a word, no.  Whereas FDR raised the tax burden by more than any other President for whom we have data during his first two years in office, Obama has reduced the tax burden by about 1.2 percentage points.  That puts him between Ike and Nixon/Ford when it comes to changes in the tax burden over the first two years.  And both Ike and Nixon/Ford went on to produce subpar growth.  So, barring some fortuitous change that has nothing to do with Obama, we can&#8217;t expect much more than mediocre growth for the remainder of Obama&#8217;s time in office.

                                <p>by <strong>Mike Kimel</strong></p>
<p>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=382">Presimetrics blog</a></p>
<p>I really don&#8217;t understand <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/03/canadian-data-on-income-stagnation.html#comments">this post by Tyler Cowen</a>.  He begins by noting:<br />
<blockquote>The median earnings of full-time Canadian workers increased by just $53 annually &#8212; that&#8217;s right, $53 annually &#8212; between 1980 and 2005.</p></blockquote>
<p>He then links to two documents, one of which says <a href="http://spon.ca/canada-discovers-trickle-up-economics/2010/12/28/">this</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A more likely explanation is that the rich have used their clout to get governments in the United States, Britain and Canada to change the rules, redirecting economic benefits to themselves.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>They convinced governments, for instance, to alter the rules governing executive stock options, making them much more lucrative. (Although only about one-third of Canada’s top corporations were using stock options early in the 1990s, they were all were using them by the end of the decade. The value of stock options for Canadian CEOs exceeded their salaries by 300 per cent.)<br /><!-- more --></p>
<p>The rich also managed to use their control of corporate boards to push up executive compensation. Since corporate boards are largely made up of corporate executives, a decision to raise the salary of an individual CEO helps set a higher standard for executive pay generally, benefitting all board members.</p>
<p>“They have a conflict of interest, since they have a stake in high financial salaries,” notes Richard Posner, a critic of today’s executive compensation (and also, incidentally, the judge who recently turned down Conrad Black’s U.S. legal appeal).</p>
<p>The rich also greatly enriched themselves by convincing governments to lower their taxes. Whereas the top marginal tax rate — the rate paid on income above a certain level — averaged 80 per cent in Canada in the early postwar years; it is now just 46 per cent (39 per cent in Alberta).</p>
<p>It was argued that lower taxes would encourage better performances at the top, increasing overall economic growth.</p>
<p>But that didn’t happen. On the contrary, economic growth rates were higher in the early postwar years — roughly twice as high — as they’ve been since 1980.</p>
<p>This suggests that higher taxes on the rich — like those in the early postwar era — do not discourage economic growth.</p>
<p>In fact, the introduction of an inheritance tax in Canada (like ones that exist in almost all advanced nations) would enable Ottawa to collect enough revenue to create educational trust funds for all Canadian children, thereby significantly improving national productivity.</p>
<p>Yet anyone advocating higher taxes on the rich is quickly denounced by groups like the right-wing Fraser Institute. Mark Milke, a commentator with the institute, dismisses concerns about rising inequality in Canada as merely the product of envy, or what he calls the “green-eyed beast.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The very next sentence Cowen writes:</p>
<blockquote><p> This is one reason why I do not adhere to some of the progressive or &#8220;class struggle&#8221; explanations of relative stagnation in median income growth.  Canada is not ruled by the so-called Republican Right.</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know enough about Canada to say whether or not the article he linked to is correct, but it seems to be directly contradicting his thesis.  </p>
<p>I note that his blog has a very, very healthy comment section, and it doesn&#8217;t seem like the folks leaving comments noticed anything amiss either.   Very odd.</p>

<p><strong>Canada too!  Part two</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=350">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>In response to my post commenting on Frances Woolley&#8217;s post, Frances Woolley left the following <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/02/canadian-economic-growth-is-about-two.html">comment</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>On WCI, one of the commentators suggested that the Liberal/Conservative growth differential is partly due to differences in military spending. In Canada where we don&#8217;t have a large defence industry, money spent on &#8220;guns and bombs&#8221; probably has a low multiplier. So the spending story could well be part of it.  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s also differences in monetary policy (Liberals are more expansionary) and immigration policy (Liberals are more pro-immigration) &#8211; though in general anti-immigrant sentiment rises in economic downturns so it&#8217;s hard to figure out what the causal mechanism is there. On the other hand, a lot of commentators on WCI have argued that, because political platforms change so much over time, it&#8217;s hard to identify any political party with any particular policy stance.</p></blockquote>
<p>I figured I probably needed at least one graph to respond properly, so its easier to do it in a post.   I would note first &#8211; I am not that familiar with Canadian data and I don&#8217;t have the time right now to plunk down some cash at Statistics Canada, so I&#8217;ll stick to the US side of things.  </p>
<p>1.  Guns and Butter.  For the US, using data from 1929 to the present, this doesn&#8217;t work.  Yes, in recent decades, Republicans have been more military oriented than Democrats.  However, FDR was president during WW2, Truman was president during Korea, and the bulk of Vietnam occurred under LBJ.  (FDR and LBJ had monster growth, Truman had crummy growth.)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>2.  Monetary policy doesn&#8217;t work at all in the US.  First, monetary policy is the prerogative of the Fed in the US, and Figure 1-10 in Presimetrics (available in the free download of <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/presi_ch1.pdf">Chapter One</a>) shows you that Republicans benefited more from the expansion of the real money supply.  And I was playing with the graphing tools at the FRED site (Federal Reserve Economic Database of St. Louis) and spit out this:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kfgsADUYhss/TVnIQJBP1_I/AAAAAAAAAis/4etqDDUJXJs/s1600/M1_indices.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kfgsADUYhss/TVnIQJBP1_I/AAAAAAAAAis/4etqDDUJXJs/s400/M1_indices.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>The curves show the percentage increase in nominal M1 over the length of each administration since the start of that administration.  Blue curves are Democratic administrations, Red are Republican.  Its pretty clear that in general, the expansion of nominal money was greater under Republicans too.</p>
<p>3.  Immigration.  Could be.  I haven&#8217;t checked.</p>
<p>4.  Policy changes over time.  In the US, at least, there has been one thing that has differentiated both parties since 1929, with two exception &#8211; Truman, the worst performing Democrat thus far, and Obama, in his first two years, also no great prize, have both behaved in a Republican way by this standards:  the change in the tax burden.  As I&#8217;ve noted time and again, you can change the tax burden two ways &#8211; one is through the law (by cutting or raising marginal rates or what income gets taxed, etc.).  The other is through enforcement.  And we find that among Democrats barring Truman and Obama, they all raised the tax burden, even LBJ who drastically cut marginal rates.  On the flip side, every Republican, even Bush 1, who famously raised marginal rates, lowered the tax burden.</p>
