<p>One raging argument that needs to be settled by the end of this year is what to do about the sunsetting of Bush tax cuts. Now it seems there are three general end points here: one, do nothing and they all expire at year&#8217;s end; two, extend them all, perhaps permanently; or three do the Obama thing and selectively extend cuts for couples making under $250,000 while letting higher income households revert to Clinton era standards. Well I am perfectly ready to debate the political and social justice aspects of any of these but maybe am not equipped to answer the following technical question.</p>
<p>The argument against allowing tax cuts to expire on the top 2% is that it would be counter-productive in a time of recession presumedly because it would serve to cut back on investment by that same top 2%. But if they are all sitting on their money anyway, resisting personal spending and as the controllers of capital sitting not only on piles of corporate cash but also on huge banking reserves hence choking off liquidity via loans to smaller banks and small businesses how exactly is nicking them an extra 3% or so in top marginal rates actually creating a net retreat in investment? It seems the argument that &#8220;If you tax the rich in a recession they won&#8217;t lend/invest&#8221; kind of fails somewhat if they aren&#8217;t lending/investing to start with. What does Kent Conrad know about this equation that I don&#8217;t know?</p>
<p>Gosh, if I only knew some smart, forward thinking economists to pose this question to.</p>

<p><strong>Tax Burdens and Economic Growth – Answering the Objections</strong></p>
<p>This piece is cross-posted with <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=92">the Presimetrics Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Consistent with findings in Presimetrics, the book I wrote with Michael Kanell which will be released in August, I’ve had some posts whose results contradict standard economic theory.  In some cases, readers have insisted that the results must be some sort of anomaly.    Perhaps the biggest offender is a graph which appeared in <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=50">this post</a>.  The graph shows growth rates in real GDP per capita by Presidency, where each President is color coded by whether he increased the tax burden (in this case defined as federal government revenues as a share of GDP) or decreased it:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1axWNOnI/AAAAAAAAATQ/xhSkh-vMz9w/s1600/growth1.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1axWNOnI/AAAAAAAAATQ/xhSkh-vMz9w/s320/growth1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a> Figure 1</p>
<p>The graph shows that Presidents who cut the tax burden produced slower growth, on average, than Presidents who increased the tax burden.  For many people, this doesn’t make sense at all.  (An explanation for why these results show up is provided <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=86">here</a>.  Now, I’ve already some of the objections that have been raised to this, mostly in private or in comments at the Angry Bear blog.   In fact, the graph above by itself answers one of the objections – I was told many times that FDR only produced faster growth because the economy accelerated during World War 2.  Thus, the graph only shows FDR’s results through 1938, which avoids the war, the build-up to the war, and even Lend Lease.   </p>
<p>Another criticism is that somehow the fact that I’m assuming that Presidents have an effect on the economy is the problem, and that a better way to do this is to look at the business cycle.  But I’ve had posts looking at the business cycle, and increasing tax burdens doesn’t look all that much better as an economic strategy across the business cycle either.  For instance, consider the following graph, one of several fairly damning graphs I posted <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=3">here</a> and  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/%EF%BB%BF%EF%BB%BFhttp://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/05/effect-of-tax-cuts-and-tax-hikes-on.html">here</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1bZaEnnI/AAAAAAAAATY/kpF73XGTgEw/s1600/growth2.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1bZaEnnI/AAAAAAAAATY/kpF73XGTgEw/s320/growth2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a> Figure 2<br /><a name="more"></a><br />If cutting the tax burdens is the right prescription during a recession, it isn’t evident from the above graph.  </p>
<p>I’ve also been accused of cherry-picking, though I’ve gone as far back as the data allows, and on most posts on this subject, I’ve actually chucked the WW2 years.  In addition, I’ve noted that throwing out outliers doesn’t change results materially.  But what if the last eight decades have all been an anomaly?  After all, shouldn’t we consider the “Roaring ‘20s,” a period which every textbook tells you was a period of rapid growth.  After all, such intellectuals as Glenn Beck, Thomas Woods, and Amity Shlaes are quick to assure that the prosperity of the 1920s was due to tax cuts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the NIPA tables don’t go that far back, so we don’t have actual data on real GDP per capita (or the tax burden).  But I’ve done my best to examine that claim; the following graph, which first appeared <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/04/1920s-depression-glenn-beck-thomas.html">here</a>, shows the top marginal tax rates and the periods (shown in gray) when the economy was in recession.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1b1038EI/AAAAAAAAATg/eAv_UNhbx9A/s1600/growth3.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1b1038EI/AAAAAAAAATg/eAv_UNhbx9A/s320/growth3.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3</p>
<p>While the 1920s was, indeed, a period when marginal tax rates were reduced, it was a period of recession followed by recession followed by recession followed by the Great Depression.   The longest consecutive months spent outside of recession during the 1920s was 27 months!  Two years and a quarter.   In fact, the economy was in recession (if not outright Depression) a full 44% of the time during the 1920s.  If these were roaring years, those roars were extremely short-lived.   </p>
<p>Which moves us to the next issue – I’ve been criticized for focusing on the tax burden rather than the marginal tax rate, the exception being in periods where the tax burden is not available.   Frankly, of all the criticisms, that one seems especially weak.  For those with enough income, the marginal tax rate is as much a fiction as the MSRP on a car; Warren Buffett’s offer of $1 million dollars to anyone on the Forbes 400 list who could prove they pay a higher share of their income in taxes than their secretary remains untaken.  </p>
<p>Moving on to the next criticism…   I’ve been told my interpretation of the above graph is wrong – it is not so much that higher tax burdens are correlated with faster economic growth, but rather that administrations that produced rapid economic growth tended to feel they could raise tax burdens, and that administrations suffering from poor growth kept tax burdens low to try to remedy a bad situation.</p>
<p>I dealt with that issue in recent posts by grouping the periods from 1929 to the present into eight year administrations, where possible.  Those administrations were made up of the eight year terms of Presidents who served two terms (or in FDR’s case, the first two terms only).  Added to those were eight year periods in which a Vice Presidents took over for a President who died or otherwise left office.  For each of those eight year terms, I created <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=60">the following graph </a>.  It shows the change in the tax burden in the first two years of each administration along one axis, and economic growth on the other axis:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2MxHT8UI/AAAAAAAAATo/k03X9X7UJJ8/s1600/growth4.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2MxHT8UI/AAAAAAAAATo/k03X9X7UJJ8/s320/growth4.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 4</p>
<p>Clearly, economic growth in years 3 through 8 cannot explain changes in the tax burden in earlier years unless one assumes time travel, clairvoyance, or one heck of a coincidence.</p>
<p>And speaking of coincidence, we arrive at another common complaint:  there simply are not enough observations to reach a conclusion of any sort.  Left unstated, of course, is that though the tax cutting Presidents had the lousiest economies, and that (as per graph 4) tax cutting led the economic growth, somehow a supposed lack observations validates the idea that lower taxes does produce faster economic growth.</p>
<p>Now, those who complain about the lack of observations generally insist that a) I don’t know the first thing about statistics and b) you need 30 or more observations to reach a conclusion.     Now that critique dates back at least three years, having been made by an anonymous blogger for the Economist who I understand is now known as Megan McArdle, and my answer (to point b.) back then is as good of an answer as any:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which is what degrees of freedom are for… Maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with the textbooks on my shelf, but the t distribution tables in the back of those textbooks have as few as 1 (one) degree of freedom. When the degrees of freedom are low, the t-statistics has to be really high in order in to reject H0. Or something like that – what do I know? </p></blockquote>
<p>Allow me to explain.  If there are a large enough number of observations to work with, it is possible to find a statistically significant difference between two things (events, peoples, outcomes, whatever) that at first glance or from a distance look very similar to the unaided eye.  However, if there are a very small number of observations, then differences have to be larger and more obvious for them to be statistically significant.   Consider three medications to extend the lives of patients with a specific type of cancer, where two have obtained FDA certification and the third was cooked up by the creepy guy who lives two houses down and uses cat puke as an active ingredient.  It might take hundreds of observations to tell which of the first two medications is more effective, but it shouldn’t take very many to tell how well the third one compares.  </p>
<p>And while in the past I sometimes decided to answer this question by running a t-test or some non-parametric test, it always seems to lead to questions about the assumptions by people who clearly never ran a hypothesis test in their lives but have one or another political point to defend to the death.  So let me try something else – an argument by analogy.  Consider the graph below.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NM-TzLI/AAAAAAAAATw/W7PBSs8LLcM/s1600/growth5.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NM-TzLI/AAAAAAAAATw/W7PBSs8LLcM/s320/growth5.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 5</p>
<p>If such a graph came from a study comparing outcomes of medications, where patients were assigned a medication but otherwise told to go about their daily business, there’d be no argument that, at least as a first approximation, there’s no reason whatsoever to assume that Medication 2 was more efficacious than Medication 1.  And if the disease in question was a particularly rare one, and the graph above represented the testing performed on every known sufferer since 1929, most of us would be appalled if a doctor decided to treat the next sufferer with Medication 2.  At the very least, we would assume that the burden of proof going forward should lie not with the proponents of Medication 1 but rather with the supporters of Medication 2, whether we understood the mechanisms by which either of these pharmaceuticals worked (or purported to work) or not.</p>
<p>And yet, this graph is identical to Figure 1, except that I changed the title and some labeling.  </p>
<p>But there is another problem with the small sample objection.  See, there are many ways to test whether there has been a negative correlation between tax burdens and economic growth, and looking at the national economy is only one of those ways.  I’ve also had a number of posts at the Angry Bear blog looking at how states have fared over the years, and there are 50 of those.  In fact, that was the topic of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2006/08/state-tax-burdens-and-growth-rates.html">the first post I ever wrote</a> four years ago next month.  In that post, a comparison of the states, using data from 1990 to 2005 yielded the following conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus, the data doesn’t seem to support the idea that lower taxes are associated with faster growth rates. In fact, the opposite is true, especially for the fastest growing states. One way to interpret this is to conclude that taxes are actually below their optimal rates, and therefore, at the margin, the government is actually more efficient than individuals at converting its spending into growth. Society needs a certain amount of public goods (infrastructure, public health, confronting the Canadian menace, etc.) for businesses to thrive, and perhaps we currently have too little provision of public goods rather than too much. </p></blockquote>
<p>And the other posts I’ve had using similar state level data have all led to the same findings.</p>
<p>Another problem frequently brought up is that growth is too complicated to be explained by a single variable.  We agree, and in the book, we actually provide a model that uses several variables.  But be that as it may, it isn’t reasonable to state that while cutting tax burdens produces faster economic growth, that effect gets swamped by opposing forces when you look at the data systematically, whether you’re looking at the performance of Presidents, at the growth during business cycles, or the performance of states.  Clearly, if reducing the amount that people pay in taxes is so beneficial to the economy, somewhere that effect would show up.  It shouldn’t be overwhelmed by other variables pushing in the opposite direction every time one tried to test it systematically and consistently.</p>
<p>Moving on, we have another little gem – that the performance of the two regimes (tax cutters and tax hikers) is not independent.  The argument is this:  tax hikers do well because they follow tax cutters who laid the foundation for growth.  Tax cutters do poorly because they have the misfortune of following tax hikers who set up the economy for a fall.  </p>
<p>This one is particularly easy to hit out of the park.  First, note that there is only one tax hiker that is followed by another tax hiker:  LBJ followed JFK.  And LBJ produced the second fastest growth in our sample, which is to say that simply following a tax hiker is no guarantee of poor performance. </p>
<p>Now, look what happens when you consider only Presidents that followed their tax burden cutting peers:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NiTfaBI/AAAAAAAAAT4/v3rI9doNIdE/s1600/growth6.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NiTfaBI/AAAAAAAAAT4/v3rI9doNIdE/s320/growth6.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 6</p>
<p>Notice that following a tax cutting President doesn’t mean one will turn in a poor performance… unless one is also a tax cutting President.  In fact, tax cutting Presidents that followed other tax cutting Presidents did worse than tax cutting Presidents who followed tax hikers.  Imagine that.  It’s almost as if the longer tax burdens are cut, the worse the outcome.  </p>
<p>And yes, I included Hoover in the above graph though we don’t have the data to know with certainty that his predecessor, Calvin Coolidge cut the burden since Coolidge is renown as a small government guy.  But leave out Hoover, and leave out Obama’s first year, and you still aren’t left with anything other than:  In fact, tax cutting Presidents that followed other tax cutting Presidents did worse than tax cutting Presidents who followed tax hikers.</p>
<p>Which leads to the sorriest objection I’ve heard, namely that the American public, the constantly gulled American public, has the ability to reason out the outcome of economic policies on the macroeconomy to near-perfection, at least in 4 year increments.  And the way it manifests itself here is this:  when the economy is about to sour, we elect tax cutters, who, in turn, manage to limit the scale of the impending disaster.  </p>
<p>This, ahem, theory (gurgle, choke) is the efficient market hypothesis on LSD.  But it has the advantage of being able to explain pretty much anything.  The problem is that it does so by breaking everything down to utter nonsense.  For instance, it would indicate that the recent housing bubble and economic meltdown, rather than being a surprise, was actually anticipated on some unconscious level by the American public, and selected for as being much better than the alternative.  Ditto the Great Depression.  So what was this worse thing that was avoided?  Locusts?  Famine and pestilence?  Billions of furious yetis descending on us from their Himalayan stronghold?  </p>
<p>And yet, despite the fact that this story makes a virtue out of nonsense, it still isn’t internally consistent.  For instance, if the American public understood that only a series of tax cuts were going to save us from something worse than the Great Recession, then wouldn’t GW have managed to have won the popular vote in 2000 and achieved a landslide in 2004.  Conversely, does the fact GW received fewer votes than Al Gore indicate that perhaps the American public did not perceive that really big threat a few years in the future?  It’s easy to knock down a story that is built on nonsense.</p>
<p>All of which brings us back to the point of this post.  Michael Kanell and I have noted that lower tax burdens are not correlated with more rapid economic growth.  In fact, from 1929 to the present (and in the book, we focus on the period from 1952 to the present) administrations that have cut the tax burden have performed worse than administrations that raised the tax burden.</p>
<p>And I think we, together and separately, have answered every reasonable objection that has come up, and even quite a few unreasonable objections to boot.  And we’ve done so in a consistent and open manner.  In our book and in my posts, we’ve been open and clear about our methods and data sources, and we’ve made an effort to treat the data as consistently and systematically as we were able.  At some point, the burden of proof should no longer lie with us, but rather on those who cling to a story that simply is not consistent with the data we have observed in the U.S. over the past few decades.  Frankly, I think we’re well past that point.</p>

                                <p>by Daniel J Becker (DOLB for the rest of you) </p>
<p>UPDATED BELOW.<br />Well, I thought being tonight is the big night for the President I would give my version of the SOU. This is an update on the flower shop. For any new readers, these are real numbers from an honest to goodness small business. </p>
<p>As you can see from the chart below, or maybe not, I don&#8217;t need a loan. I don&#8217;t need a tax break. I could use a real national health plan as the medical for this year again, including premiums hit $15K (16.5 and 17.7 prior 2 years). I have a high deductible plan that increased from $6471 in &#8217;06 to $7195 in 2009, 11% up. </p>
<p>No, even if you did the cash for clunkers again, I don&#8217;t have the extra cash flow to take a loan. Though the delivery van has 235K miles on it. It&#8217;s a 2002 Caravan. </p>
<p>All my loans are fixed, so I&#8217;m not worried about deficit fueled inflation as it relates to my monthly payments. My property, even with the 15% loss in the last 2 years based on tax evals is still 1.69 times more than my mortgages and I only have 15 or less years to go. </p>
<p>We&#8217;re working with less people at the shop and have layed off our manager/worker (he&#8217;s fast, a good designer and can carry the load when we&#8217;re not there) to 1/2 time. We&#8217;re watching every penny as to inventory, utilities, insurances (I&#8217;m getting money back on the WC because payroll is down). </p>
<div>What I&#8217;m worried about is this: </div>
<div>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/S2Dfipp4YJI/AAAAAAAAAP0/NFBSkU3Kyvk/s1600-h/Flower%20Shop%20Gross%20Revenues.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197" mt="true" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/S2Dfipp4YJI/AAAAAAAAAP0/NFBSkU3Kyvk/s320/Flower%20Shop%20Gross%20Revenues.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>Keep in mind, that we were considered a larger than normal shop. If we&#8217;re doing this bad, imagine how the wholesalers and everyone else down line are doing. That&#8217;s the real trickle down folks!</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>There is only one thing that will fix it: CUSTOMERS!
<div>It&#8217;s not that people are not trying to spend, it&#8217;s that they really have run out of money. Note that the credit card sales continued to rise for a year after the account and cash sales started to decline. </div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/S2DfcNqLzvI/AAAAAAAAAPs/AScsID-X5KI/s1600-h/Flower%20Shop%20Cash%20CC%20Account%20sales.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197" mt="true" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/S2DfcNqLzvI/AAAAAAAAAPs/AScsID-X5KI/s320/Flower%20Shop%20Cash%20CC%20Account%20sales.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div>The people tried to spend. Now they can&#8217;t.</div>
<div></div>
<p>So, let me be clear to the Congress and the President: I NEED CUSTOMERS&#8230;WITH MONEY!</p>
<p>Update:  A commentor asked for some more data.  <br />Ins, Maintenance, Rent, Utilities, and Property/inventory taxes are 13% of gross. Payroll is 25% Payroll is down 14%, but gross is down 16%. We can cut payroll more, but the issue becomes my sweety having some down time. (please no lectures). Payroll was 25% of gross last year. </p>
<p>Supplies (what we sell) were 48% of last years gross, this year 47%.</p>

<p>Sunday Basket O&#8217; Questions</p>
<p>1.  The Climate Change memos have opened up some interesting questions.  Like, who are the thieves, and when will we see them in court?  And if the thieves are shown to be employees of Big Oil or Big Coal, are the Bigs profiting from this crime?  The proceeds of crime can be seized by the government &#8212;  I will be interested to see how the amount of extra profit might be measured, and how a fungible asset is seized.</p>
<p>A criminal conviction might not be necessary, either. Wiki tells us:  &#8220;In civil forfeiture cases, the US Government sues the item of property, not the person; the owner is effectively a third party claimant. Once the government establishes probable cause that the property is subject to forfeiture, the owner must prove on a &#8220;preponderance of the evidence&#8221; that it is not. The owner need not be judged guilty of any crime.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the data thieves don&#8217;t end up in court, then does this mean e-mail archives in general are fair game for worldwide publication?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve been told that there is no real privacy on the Internet &#8212; what if it&#8217;s true?  &#8220;If you could read anyone&#8217;s complete email archives, completely safe from legal punishment,  which archives would those be?&#8221; The question is bound to bring a dreamy expression to the thoughtful person&#8217;s face.  It&#8217;s even rather Biblical:   Luke 12:3 &#8220;Therefore whatsoever ye have spoken in darkness shall be heard in the light; and that which ye have spoken in the ear in closets shall be proclaimed upon the housetops.&#8221;  Hackers, start your engines.</p>
<p>2.  A financial &#8220;bubble&#8221; is usually thought of as a thin skin of substance surrounding &#8230; nothing.  But no real-world bubble surrounds nothing &#8212; if there was nothing inside, it would be a droplet, not a bubble.</p>
<p>So what inflates a financial bubble?  And when the bubble collapses, what happens to the &#8220;filler?&#8221;</p>
<p>3.  The missing phrase in discussing taxes is &#8220;for what?&#8221;  High taxes in themselves are no burden.  Low taxes in themselves are no comfort.  Arguing tax size without addressing its use is like knitting with only one needle.</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>So I check my mail today, 10/17 (been attending continuing ed this weekend) and find that as a member of the National Association of the Self-Employed (150K strong) I will now receive a news letter of sorts from a John Mauldin by receiving his latest: Muddle Through, R.I.P?   Muddle Through is some interpretation of his from 2002 as to what the economy was.  In a word the economy was: Yawn.  Slow growth, jobless recovery.</p>
<p>He then gets into his real message: Deficits as far as you can see thus, we&#8217;re screwed.  Here we come Japan, “Japanese Disease”, unless we can get savings and there is a way to do it. (Can you guess where he&#8217;s going?)</p>
<p>Mr. Mauldin starts off with some math and explanation to make his case:<br />
<blockquote>GDP (Gross Domestic Product) is defined as Consumption (C) plus Investment (I) plus Government Spending (G) plus [Exports (E) minus Imports (I)] or: <br />GDP = C + I + G + (E-I)<br />(For the wonks out there, GDP is usually termed &#8220;Y&#8221;.)</p>
<p>This equation is known as an identity. An identity is an equality that remains true regardless of the values of any variables that appear within it. That means it is not a guess or an approximation. It is simple reality.</p>
<p>Thus, if there is a government deficit, there must be savings by both consumers and businesses, plus capital flows from outside the country, to offset that deficit in order for there to be any money left over for investments&#8230; There must be savings in order for there to be investment. And without investment, you do not get job growth or economic growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>During his Japanese Disease part of the argument we get to the bottom line:<br />
<blockquote>Since government deficit spending has no long-term multiplier effect, growth has been nonexistent. (By the way, that research about multiplier effects has also been done by Christina Romer, the chairman of the current President&#8217;s Council of Economic Advisors, and further explored by European economists. There is general agreement on these facts.)</p></blockquote>
<p>He then quotes Professor Barro (do you see now where he&#8217;s going?):<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;&#8230;The government problem is complicated by the fact that the tax multiplier is 3, meaning that a 1% change in taxes will change GDP by about 3% over time. More recent research (Barro &#038; Redlick, September 2009, &#8220;NBER Working Paper 15369&#8243;) suggests that a 1% cut in the marginal tax rate would raise GDP in the ensuing year by 0.6%. With the deficit rising due to a zero spending multiplier, the tendency will be to try to raise taxes to pay for this higher level of expenditures, which will further depress aggregate spending and output.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there it is, some Romer interpretation.  But, we&#8217;re not fully there as to the solution.  The banks are missing in this presentation until Mr. Mauldin asks who will buy this debt?   <em>“I think that the buyers of the debt could be US banks for quite some time&#8230;”</em> then notes that banks are not lending and asks:<br />
<blockquote>So where do banks put their cash and reserves they are not lending? At the Fed and in Treasury debt. If you can leverage capital at ten to one (as banks can) and if you get 2% (for longer-term debt) and if you only have costs of, say, 50 basis points (or 0.5%), you can make a return on equity of 15% with no risk.</p></blockquote>
<p>Thus, they are not lending because there is no need to in order to make money which has hurt small and medium businesses by cutting off their “life blood” resulting in no job creation.</p>
<p>Oh, another thing, banks are taking a hit on commercial real estate so they need to save (his words are “raise capital”).  Poor banks are just trying to survive and the lowly job seekers are just the collateral damage. So sorry.</p>
<p>Are you following?  Massive government deficit is causing the banks to park their government created money in the government and it&#8217;s killing our jobs because the small and medium business can&#8217;t  get a loan because the banks need to save in order to cover the commercial real estate losses.  <br />
<blockquote>Large government deficits choke off the very investment that we need to create jobs.</p></blockquote>
<p>So just what would the banks do about the commercial real estate losses if the government didn&#8217;t have this massive debt to make money off of?  How would they save?  Does this part of his argument not suggest that the deficit is good if the goal is to save the banks?  That has been the goal after all.</p>
<p>This get&#8217;s us to the Romers specifically.  At the end of the debt bad (but good for the banks), we&#8217;re contracting Japanese Disease, banks are being banks (being savings institutions) and it is all killing the jobs we get this:<br />Given that the current Congress is hell bent on massively raising taxes in 2011, we are likely to dip back into recession by then, if not before. Remember, taxes have a multiplier effect of three. That means tax cuts increase GDP (over time) by three times their amount. But tax increases reduce GDP by three times the increase. That will make deficits worse, and unemployment will again start to rise from already high levels. Twenty states have already raised sales taxes, and more are raising other taxes. It is a vicious spiral.</p>
<p>You know what is missing from his argument which, because it is missing makes it a bastard argument?  It is this: <br />http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~cromer/draft1108.pdf<br />Panel (d) shows that the point estimates for the effect of a deficit-driven tax increase of 1% of GDP on GDP are consistently positive. However, there are too few tax changes of this type for the effects to be estimated precisely. <strong>The maximum impact is a rise in GDP of 2.48%</strong> (t = 1.03). While one should be very cautious in reading anything into such imprecise estimates, <strong>the results are suggestive that tax increases to reduce an inherited deficit may be less costly than other tax increases.</strong></p>
<p>You know what is another example of a bastard argument?  It is the one made by the person that took some medical well baby guidelines and implemented a policy that prevented a 4 month old from getting health insurance coverage for being too fat!  </p>
<p>Bastardization of research happens all the time by the health insurance industry.  I hope there are other doc&#8217;s on Mr. Mauldin&#8217;s email list that make the same recognition of his argument.  I don&#8217;t see how they can&#8217;t.  We deal with it every day.   </p>
<p>Sure glad I have the doc&#8217;s here at AB that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">are into</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/more-on-romer-and-romer-2007.html">economic wellness care</a>.</p>

<p>Well there is no such bill, but it would be a good title for what we would see if we put the entire economic right tax agenda together. Because what seem to be totally different arguments end up delivering the same outcome.</p>
<p>We can start with the corporate income tax. The argument here is that it represents &#8216;double taxation&#8217; and/or that it just gets passed through in prices. Okay we can debate that in comments if you like.</p>
<p>Then we can move on to the estate tax. Along with emotional appeals to the &#8216;death tax&#8217; you get an argument about it being unfair to small business and family farms. Another topic for debate.</p>
<p>Moving along we have tax on dividends and tax on capital gains. Once again we have our old friend &#8216;double taxation&#8217; along with arguments that taxes on these simply reduce motivation for re-investment.</p>
<p>Well then we can step down the road to marginal tax rates. Obviously higher rates similarly reduce reinvestment.</p>
<p>Which brings us to the Flat Tax. Here the argument is that you can save billions in compliance costs and so have everyone paying less. This argument is a hoot, but I&#8217;ll leave it for others.</p>
<p>What would happen if you passed all of this as a package? And all with arguments stemming from economic equity and efficiency in order to get majority support?</p>
<p>Billionaires would never have to pay a dime in federal taxes. There are I believe five Walton&#8217;s heirs. If you eliminated corporate income tax there would be that much more to distribute as dividends, which should also serve to drive the stock price up. If you eliminate the tax on dividends than each would have just that much more money to spend or reinvest. If you further eliminate taxes on capital gains (all in the interest of the larger economy of course), any stock sales for the purposes of diversification or otherwise would not be subject to tax. And if as a final step you eliminated the estate tax the entire capital accumulation would pass tax free to the next generation.</p>
<p>If we choose we can have a spirited debate on all of these separately or in combination, have at it (I am going out for lunch). But if we yielded individually on each issue to these economic right proposals and all of it was wrapped up into one bill the post title becomes perfectly appropriate. Because when it comes down to their total agenda the economic right fully agrees with the famous dictum of heiress <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leona_Helmsley">Leona Helmsley</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t pay taxes. Only the little people pay taxes &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Why does the Queen of England have multiple palaces and huge collections of jewels and gilded carriages? Because until recent times Royals paid no taxes at all and certainly no taxes on capital. Did the British Monarchy actually deliver value in exchange for that status? Well the American Colonists certainly didn&#8217;t think George III was worth it, but that is a decision for the British People. The question is whether we want to transform holders of great family wealth into our own heriditary tax-free aristocracy? Do we want to transform &#8216;hedge fund king&#8217; from a metaphor to a reality?</p>
<p>If so lets get busy on the Helmsley Act.</p>
<p>If not always remember that the first question you should ask about such proposals is &#8216;cui bono&#8217; and not just at the margins. Who gets how much?</p>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s time to reread the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html">World Bank report</a> on what creates wealth because it seems that the arguments against the stimulus are from a mind-set of very narrow thinking about what creates wealth.  They all seem focused on what the World Bank report calls “Produced Capital”.   Unfortunately, focusing on just that aspect of capital reduces our nation to growth based on 18% of our economic power.  And, as far as I have understood the arguments for tax cuts, they are based on effecting this small aspect of what produces wealth in a developed economy like ours.  <br />
<blockquote>“The rest of the story is intangible capital. <strong>That encompasses raw labor; human capital, which includes the sum of a population&#8217;s knowledge and skills; and the level of trust in a society and the quality of its formal and informal institutions.</strong> Worldwide, the study finds, &#8220;natural capital accounts for 5 percent of total wealth, produced capital for 18 percent, and intangible capital 77 percent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You know what that is?  Democratic traditional spending priorities.  <br />
<blockquote>“Rich countries are largely rich because of the skills of their populations and the quality of the institutions supporting economic activity,&#8221; the study concludes. According to Hamilton&#8217;s figures, the rule of law explains 57 percent of countries&#8217; intangible capital. Education accounts for 36 percent.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Get that?  It means tax cuts are just stupid policy if the goal is to stimulate a developed economy as strongly as possible such that the stimulus creates lasting wealth.  Is that not the complaint by the republicans and blue dogs, the lack of lasting wealth which means jobs as the stimulus is written?  What the World Bank report means is, if you want the biggest bang for your greenback, you have to weigh the heavy side of the stimulus to  invest in <em>“human capital, which includes the sum of a population&#8217;s knowledge and skills; and the level of trust in a society and the quality of its formal and informal institutions.”  </em></p>
<p>You have to load the stimulus to the 77% side and not the 23% side (natural 5% and produced capital 18%).   That is 3.4 human capital to 1 natural/produced capital.   That means education (all forms and subjects), support for the economically disadvantaged (welfare, medicaid), health care (medicare, national health payment reform, system IT), risk prevention and recovery (law, fire/rescue, FEMA), science (greening energy, environment)  and the arts (art districts, museums) to suggest a few. </p>
<p>Beyond that, the intentional campaign to sway public opinion by purposefully lying about the way a stimulus such as is being proposed will function, is to actually predestine our efforts to failure. The reason is because the campaign is producing a lack of trust.<br />
<blockquote>“An economy with a very efficient judicial system, clear and enforceable property rights, and an effective <strong>and uncorrupt government will produce higher total wealth</strong>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As noted above, the level of trust in a society of its institutions is of issue regarding the level of capital available to produce wealth.   The greatest harm that is coming from the republican&#8217;s drive to instill their minority will on the many out of selfish want, is to further the demise of the people&#8217;s trust.  For the blue dogs it is their ignorance of their economic ideology that creates the mistrust.  The republicans/blue dogs, and those helping them by lending their &#8220;professionalism&#8221;, think they are only effecting a political strategy.  In truth, they are destroying the very basis for the wealth they desire.  Their entire campaign for decades to discredit, to instill mistrust in the primary institution we have, the US (We the People) government, has been the primary cause to our economic decline.  To increase the level of distrust is to decrease the available “intangible capital” which is  77% of our wealth generating power.   </p>
<p>Pushing tax cuts, dear republicans and blue dogs, is actually working against the economic goal you profess to desire for the American people because enacting tax cuts promotes the weakest power of our economy while the promoting of tax cuts is destroying the strongest power of our economy. </p>

<p>Time to pile on regarding the 300 economists for the McCain economic plan.  I thought it was pretty funny that Douglas Holtz-Eakin signed on &#8212; &#8216;look, boss, I approve of my own plan!&#8217; &#8212; and the presences of the likes of Phil Gramm, Kevin Hassett, and John R. Lott Jr. should be viewed as each constituting minus a large number of good economists, so the net number of signatories is close to zero.</p>
<p>The opportunity for confusion, as even <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/07/08/the-economic-policy-of-john-mccain?rss=true">Felix Salmon exhibits some</a>, is the presence of undeniably prominent economists on the list.  To help in evaluating the significance of there presence, here&#8217;s a prediction from quasi-Nobel laureate Gary Becker (signer of the McCain statement), current CEA chair Edward Lazear, and John Bates Clark medalist Kevin Murphy of the Chicago GSB (Lazear and Murphy did not sign):<br />
<blockquote>The evidence is clear: Cutting taxes will have beneficial effects. Tax cuts will keep government spending in check and will provide the incentives necessary to produce a highly skilled, productive work force that enables high economic growth and rising standards of living.</p></blockquote>
<p>That was from &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB106548881712135300-search.html?collection=wsjie%252F30day&#038;vql_string=becker%253Cin%253E%2528article%252Dbody%2529">The Double Benefits of Tax Cuts</a>,&#8221; published on the W$J op-ed page on October 7, 2003.  Goes to show that the line between being a real economist and a &#8220;policy entrepreneur&#8221; is a fine one. For some indications of how that has worked out, see e.g. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">here</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-fiscal.html">here</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-personal-income.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/comparing-presidents-average-real.html">here</a> from the AB archives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, leave it to the <a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2008/07/in-brief-john-mccain-hateshearts.html">Rude Pundit</a> to get right to the fundamental contradiction of the list (a very extended, and actually non-rude, excerpt is required):<br />
<blockquote>So John McCain proposes a gas tax holiday and economists almost universally say it&#8217;s a stupid idea. In June, McCain, being a reasonable man, chooses to mock the economists: &#8220;If you want to call it a gimmick, fine. You know the economists? They’re the same ones that didn’t predict this housing crisis we’re now in.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Now McCain has put forth a great and mighty economic plan. Did it yesterday, less than a month after dissing the poindexters. And his campaign has released a letter from, well, who else? Economists who support it. Oodles of them. Guess they know a lot about economics, eh?</p>
<p>&#8230;[T]he Rude Pundit chose one of the names at relatively random. University of Chicago&#8217;s Gary Becker, who does a blog on, you know, economics&#8230; [B]ack in December 2007, Becker says, &#8220;The vast majority of economists, including me, were surprised by the extent of the subprime mortgage crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, to conclude: for John McCain, economists who didn&#8217;t predict the mortgage crisis don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about when it comes to a gas tax holiday, but when it comes to his entire economic plan, they&#8217;re a-ok. What fun.</p>
<p>Does that qualify as straight talk?</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Go figure – the National Review is on the tax cut bandwagon again. <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTQyODBlYzAyM2M2ZTYwY2NjMzhkNGYxZjZjNzE4OTY">Lawrence Kudlow</a> provides a summary of all the GOP Presidential candidate’s ideas but he offers no analysis beyond calling the Huckabee Flat Tax “flawed” and tossing words like “gonzo” around as if such terms carried some deep economic meaning. OK, Kudlow has decided to criticize President Bush for turning to the Keynesian dark side. But we have to turn to <a href="http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MGRjYjZiYmQyMzcyYmFjMWFlZDAwY2VkZjgxOGQzOWI=">Thomas Nugent</a> to see what the NRO nitwits are really thinking:</p>
<blockquote><p>The idea is that a lower fed funds rate will free the economy from weakness by encouraging borrowing and spending. But the pundits seem to forget just what led the U.S. out of its most recent downturn, the Y2K-induced mini-recession of 2001. President Bush and his advisors saw the need for immediate fiscal stimulus, and they pushed through a tax-cut package that at least neutralized the downturn. Unfortunately, since there were not enough incentives built into that tax cut, financial markets were unimpressed and the bear market extended into 2002.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hmm? It was that “perfectly timed” 2001 tax cut that saved the day! Or was it as Nugent admits that the recovery was really weak until late 2003. But then Nugent claims it was those 2003 reductions in dividend tax rates that led to the recovery. Increases in defense spending, business investment finally unwinding its overhang from the investment led recession and responding to falling long-term rates, and rising exports from dollar devaluation were all irrelevant I guess. What passes for economic commentary over at the National Review gets sillier and sillier.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N">This source</a>, which one of our rightwing trolls says does not exist, shows that real defense spending increased by 7.4% in 2002, 8.7% in 2003, and 5.8% in 2004.  The biggest jump came in the second quarter of 2003.  But our rightwing troll says this had nothing to do with the fact the real GDP growth finally took off in 2003.  Yep – rightwing trolls get to call those of us who live in the real world liars as facts really do not exist in their world.  Go figure.</p>
