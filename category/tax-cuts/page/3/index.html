                                <p>By: Daniel Becker (DOLB)</p>
<p>On Countdown (12/9/10), Keith had on Thomas Buffenbarger, president of the International Machinist Union. It was a chance for an “I told you so moment”in that Mr. Buffenbarger noted while campaigning for Secretary Clinton that President Obama would not be a fighter. Go watch <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677/ns/msnbc_tv-countdown_with_keith_olbermann/#40596879">the episode</a>.</p>
<p>I made<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/all-you-need-to-know-to-understand.html"> my position on of Obama</a> clear after the 60 Minutes interview. Mr. Buffenbarger&#8217;s comments only reinforces my position as to understanding President Obama as does Obama&#8217;s latest “negotiation”. Surprisingly, only 4 comments were made. Too bad, the nation would have been more prepared for this latest act in &#8220;Obama the Negotiator. Not!&#8221;</p>
<p>But, that is not what got me regarding Mr. Buffenbarger&#8217;s interview. No. It was that he confirmed something I have been thinking since Obama stated his compromise policy after this current midterm elections. </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;when Bush put the tax cut&#8217;s in place, very few of the members I&#8217;m privileged to represent noticed any difference in their pay check. And so, if the tax cuts were to go away, and we go back to the tax rates of then, our members would see very little change in their tax rates again.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>Exactly. Has not the argument been that the cuts did little for the middle class? Then what is the problem with letting them go? I know for me it meant very little difference. Though, I realize having “meaning” is different for all so, here is a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/packages/khtml/2005/06/05/national/20050605_HYPER_GRAPHIC.html?scp=2&#038;sq=%22class+matters%22&#038;st=m">very nice chart</a> I saved from 2005 looking at the tax cuts and what they meant for the various income groups.</div>
<div></div>
<div>First, let me say that when I initially viewed this chart years ago, I thought: How appropriate. Those who most likely think the republican party was watching out for them via tax cuts because they were in that top part of the food chain, were actually getting screwed too. Yeah, the one who you believes loves you is taking you for a ride. Those in the $100K to $300K range of income by 2015 were projected to pay a higher percentage of the share of national income taxes than they had before the cuts. And, even those above the $300k to the $1.5m range were getting much less of a break than their income relatives above them. Poetic justice? Just goes to show, that even those with significant incomes have no real conception of how small theirs is compared to the incomes of the upper echelons of this nation. But hey, you keep believing you&#8217;re just like them. It&#8217;s what they want. </div>
<p>More to the point of this post. Look at the “Average yearly tax savings” line for those from the lowest to the $383K level. I realize everyone&#8217;s situation is unique, but really, the range of the cost of the loss of the tax savings is virtually zero to 2.5% if your at $160K or 1% for those at $383k. As a share of supporting this nation, you/we have been screwed. I ask you all. The bottom 99%. Wouldn&#8217;t you like to really stick it to the economic royalty in this nation? Is 1% to 2.5% to much to give to finally get reality into the income tax?</p>
<p>You there in the 95 to 99% category. Your 2001 share of income was 15%.   Your projected share of the taxes in 2015 is 18.5% A ratio of 0.81. For your senior income family members the ratio in 2015 is 0.74. Still feeling loved? </p>
<p>Look at it this way. Based on this 2005 chart. The bottom 99% paid 75.3% of all income taxes before the tax cuts. Our projected share for 2015, the very tax cuts Obama et al have just negotiated to keep is 77.1%. </p>
<p>Who loves you now, baby?</p>
<p>Mr. Buffenbarger ended noting that his members understand that paying taxes is a privilege and is an act of support of our country. It is paying our way. So what do you say. Let&#8217;s show those at the very top just how unpatriotic they are. Let the tax cuts go and stand proud because honest American justice has prevailed.   You just screwed the biggest screwer of them all&#8230;The American Economic Royalty.</p>
<p>That is what the real Tea Party was about.</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Linda Beale</strong><br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/12/more-on-the-white-house-deal-on-tax-cuts.html" target="_blank">More on the White House &#8220;deal&#8221; on tax cuts</a><br />crossposted with <strong>Ataxingmatter</strong>
<p>Dan Shaviro, a colleague at NYU, ends up being hopeful about the Obama-GOP deal.  See &#8220;The <a href="http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/2010/12/deal-on-extending-tax-c-uts.html">deal on extending the tax cuts</a>&#8220;, Start Making Sense, Dec. 6, 2010 and &#8220;<a href="http://danshaviro.blogspot.com/2010/12/tax-cut-deal-too-soon-to-tell-who.html">The tax cut deal: too soon to tell who really won?</a>&#8220;, Dec. 7, 2010.  I think that is because Dan tends to credit Economics 101 with considerably more wisdom than I do (and place &#8220;efficiency&#8221;, as defined by the free marketers, higher on the wish list for tax policy than I), so he thinks Social Security isn&#8217;t on a sound footing and that benefits will need to be cut; thinks expensing for corporations is a reasonable way to spur growth; thinks there is some possibility that the 2012 replay of &#8220;Bush tax cuts, take 2&#8221; might play out in favor of Obama if he is &#8220;very clear that he planned to veto any extensions and let all the tax cuts expire UNLESS the Republicans made the deal he requires&#8221;.  I&#8217;ll intersperse my comments with Dan&#8217;s below.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>1) extending all the expiring individual rate cuts for 2 years:</p>
<p>Dan says &#8220;we knew this was going to happen&#8221; so the only problem is that it comes up again in 2012 when Obama will &#8220;might face extra credibility problems&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think we only knew this was going to happen because Obama didn&#8217;t fight on this at all.  Obama signalled at the beginning that he would cave, and he did not take to the bully pulpit at all.  He conferenced with Republicans and cut out the Democratic leadership in reaching his &#8220;deal&#8221;&#8211;which is a Republican policy in everything but name.</p>
<p>2) extending unemployment insurance through 2011:</p>
<p>Dan says it is an important stimulus and &#8220;wasn&#8217;t going to happen otherwise.&#8221; </p>
<p>I agree on the stimulus.  But the Dems should have brought unemployment extension up on a daily basis and forced the Republicans to vote against it.  So the &#8220;wasn&#8217;t going to happen otherwise&#8221; is part of the give-up before you start negotiating that got us into this mess. </p>
<p>3) reduce the Social Security payroll tax by 2% for one year:</p>
<p>Dan says &#8220;good stimulus&#8221; though &#8220;targeting could have been a lot better&#8221; and admits my point (made when payroll holidays were first brought up) that the payroll holiday feeds into the drive to decimate Social Security by hitting the Trust Fund.  But Dan thinks the &#8220;concern&#8221; about long-term fiscal problems is real, and so is comfortable with addressing it &#8220;sooner&#8221; anyway.</p>
<p>I disagree. The concern about Social Security is being hyped in order to destroy Social Security as we know it.  It is in line with the enmity towards unions, towards single payer health care, towards re-regulation of the banks, towards breaking apart big banks, and towards any other policy that would restore a vibrant middle class.  By allowing a payroll holiday for everyone, the majority of the benefit goes to people who don&#8217;t really need it, and too little benefit goes to those who do.  Targeting is better than a tax cut purely for the rich, but that isn&#8217;t saying much.  Doing some stimulus in a means that pushes the GOP agenda to eviscerate Social Security forward is like tying one hand behind your back&#8211;a rather unwise way to enter a long-term battle for the economic future.  Will we have the brutal mix of casino and winner-take-all capitalism that has driven most of this country&#8217;s policies from Reagan on or will we have a tempered capitalism that ensures a broad-based growth and creates an economic system that works for everyone?  The Republican&#8217;s aims to let states go into bankruptcy and use that mechanism to destroy public employee unions says they are in this battle to destroy the New Deal if they can.  We need to fight just as hard on the side of the middle class.</p>
<p>4) Estate tax cut by increasing the exemption from the 2001 level to $5 million (basically 500% of the 2001 amount) and lowering the top rate to a mere 35%.</p>
<p>Dan thinks this might actually be preferable &#8220;in efficiency terms&#8221; to the current law, which would have restored 2001 rates in 2011, if done in a &#8220;distribution and revenue neutral framework&#8221;.  And even though this isn&#8217;t that, he doesn&#8217;t think a more progressive estate tax &#8220;is long-term feasible anyway.&#8221;  So this is not &#8220;a terrible outcome in a realistic overall sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here we part ways 100%.  There is no such thing as a distribution and revenue neutral framework&#8211;that is a fiction of economics 101 that permits what we have seen, which is four decades of redistribution upwards.  Further, distribution neutral is not desirable in an economy where the winners already take all&#8211;if we don&#8217;t reverse the direction of distribution in this economy, we will end up in oligarchy (if we aren&#8217;t there already).  In that context, this was the single most viable opportunity for reinstating an appropriate estate tax, either by letting the Republican-passed law take hold (return to 2001 exemption and rates) or by passing a slightly modified but ideally more progressive version (higher exemption but progressively higher rates beginning at 45%).  This is indeed &#8220;a terrible outcome in a realistic overall sense.&#8221;</p>
<p>5) extensions of the EITC, tuition tax credit and expensing (as well as the R&#038;D credit, not mentioned by Dan </p>
<p>Dan says that the EITC and tuition tax credit are okay because they may add progressivity and the expensing provision is okay as a short-term stimulus.</p>
<p>The EITC is okay.  Tuition tax credits just subsidize the things colleges spend money on that they don&#8217;t want students to have to feel they are paying for&#8211;like too high administrative salaries (across-the board, at private and public universities).   We ought to fund higher education at public institutions, but with conditions, such as limiting the percentage of total budget spent on administration or on the revenue sports, etc.  As for expensing, it is unclear how it can be stimulative in this context, when the reason companies aren&#8217;t expanding is because they don&#8217;t see a demand for the business.  Most companies have the cash on hand and can borrow at a funding cost that is extraordinarily low.  That isn&#8217;t what is holding back investment.  Odds are, the savings from expensing will just go to another round of higher manager salaries and big payouts to shareholders (who will also continue to benefit from an extraordinarily low dividend and capital gains rate under the deal).</p>
<p>Dan seems to think that Obama will be able to argue credibly that &#8220;this time I mean it&#8221; when it comes to the 2012 election and the Bush tax cuts are ready to expire once again.  Fat chance. There&#8217;s nothing so far to convince anyone&#8211;Obama caved before fighting on the public option and on taxes for the rich and on the estate tax and on capital gains and on carried interest and on and on.  Obama in fact is now pushing his Democratic colleagues to support an agenda that will easily get 100% Republican support and maybe enough reluctant Democratic support to pass, rather than rallying them to fight so that he can veto, if need be, wrong-headed legislation.  So he has proven that the Dems lose in the minority and they don&#8217;t bother to fight when they are in the majority.  No way his base will trust him to do it better next time around. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the GOP is already blaring that there is no way that they&#8217;ll give an inch on anything.  They won&#8217;t support the Build America Bond program, because they want states to declare bankruptcy as a means to destroy public employee unions.  And they don&#8217;t seem to care that they are destroying the American social contract between the wealthy and the rest of us at the same time&#8211;we are what we are because we have recognized the importance of a strong middle class that acts as a check on oligarchy.  Yet the Republican party&#8211;and now too many Dems&#8211;are willing to throw it all away just to get elected one more time (maybe) in the future.</p>
<p>In my view, the American people are the losers here.  The AMT patch primarily helps those with high incomes.  Most of those who pay the AMT because of bracket creep are in the 250-500,000 income range&#8211;certainly not middle class.   Only a few are in the 75-100,000 range.  The extension of extremely favorable taxation of secondary market capital gains and dividend income is of benefit to the wealthy who own most of the financial assets.  The extension of the tax rate cuts even below 250,000 already aids the wealthy&#8211;adding the tax rate cut at the top means that most of the rate cut goes to the very well off.  This is a very good deal with corporate managers and owners, and rotten for ordinary Americans. It&#8217;s the upside down world of George W. &#8220;the have-mores are my base&#8221; Bush.</p>

<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TPhUbVHueBI/AAAAAAAAAdY/3BSBxyt1Q40/s1600/deficit-pig-eating-bush-tax-cuts.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TPhUbVHueBI/AAAAAAAAAdY/3BSBxyt1Q40/s320/deficit-pig-eating-bush-tax-cuts.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<blockquote><p> &#8230; In other words, let’s try to avoid doing something with the Bush tax cuts that seems totally crazy given what we say our fiscal policy goals are for both adequately supporting the (still fragile) short-term economy and better encouraging economic growth by reducing the deficit over the longer term.</p>
<p>The fiscal policymaking in this town seems totally schizophrenic right now.  What a juxtaposition to have President Obama’s deficit-reduction commission release its final report while the Administration “negotiates” with Congress on whether all of the Bush tax cuts, or just most of them, should be permanently extended (and deficit financed).  The media has been reporting that whether the bulk of the Bush tax cuts will be extended or not is not the issue–it is whether the upper-bracket ones benefitting only the rich will be included as well, and what constitutes “rich.”</p>
<p><strong>&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>I think most Americans who are paying attention to today’s fiscal policy news are probably shaking their heads and/or cussing and/or laughing in a dark-humor sort of way.  It seems both ridiculous and tragic that our leaders can proclaim their intent to get our fiscal house in order out of one side of their mouths, while arguing to keep (forever) their favorite piece of the fiscally-reckless and economically-ineffective Bush tax cuts out the other.   They are so busy screaming at each other from their (sticky, embedded) corners that they can’t see the common ground between them. </p></blockquote>

<p><strong>A Proposed Bet for Professors Bryan Caplan and David R. Henderson</strong> (and Anyone Else Who Believes Lower Taxes Generate Faster Economic Growth)<br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=23">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>Professors Caplan and Henderson,</p>
<p>Both of you have had recent posts that indicate you have some enthusiasm for <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/11/why_not_bet_mor.html">betting</a> on <a href="http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/11/raising_the_sta.html">economic outcomes</a>.   (Your co-blogger at Econlog, Arnold Kling seems less enthusiastic about bets, and thus I have not addressed him by name here.)  I have a few criticisms of your approach to betting.  The first is that, frankly, y&#8217;all are betting on some rather peripheral issues.  Why not cut to the chase?  Why not propose a bet on something vital to your way of thinking but with which many people disagree?  For example, as libertarians you believe that lower marginal tax rates on the &#8220;producer class&#8221; result in faster economic growth in a well-functioning, more or less market based economy, and that this outcome can be observed in the US economy.  (Forgive the wordiness, but I want to be precise so you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m trying to trap you up in a technicality or some oddball example.)  I believe you are generally wrong, at least about the US economy.  Many people share your beliefs, and many people share mine, so this would be an ideal topic on which to bet if your goal is to prove a point.</p>
<p>Another criticism I have of the bets I&#8217;ve seen you propose is that your bets tend to be based on a small number of events, typically one or a handful of observations occurring over ten years or less.  But that is too short a period to leave out the effect of random fluctuations, acts of God, or long running conditions.  For example, though I haven&#8217;t verified the data myself, I understand that it has been pointed out that had the Julian Simon bet (a favorite of Professor Henderson&#8217;s) occurred a few years later <a href="http://gregor.us/fossil-fuels/friday-notebook-the-new-simon-ehrlich-teaching-story/">results would have been different</a>.  A truly fair bet would look at more data.  In fact, an ideal bet would look at many different overlapping long time periods.  Results over ten year windows, twenty windows, thirty year windows, etc., would all combined to ensure that the results aren&#8217;t just an artifact of the data.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Another safeguard which helps get at a &#8220;true outcome&#8221; rather than some random fluctuation is to consider whether the effect you are looking at can have lags of different lengths.  For example, it may be that the marginal tax rate in 2010 might affect growth rates from 2009 to 2010, or from 2010 to 2011, or from 2010 to some later year.  After all, as any libertarian would say, if you pay less in taxes this year, it means more money in your pocket this year.  Since you spend more efficiently than the government, that creates more growth this year, and that additional growth has positive effects next year too.  Of course, at some point, the future effects of today&#8217;s tax rates dissipate.  Not having a precise theory, it probably pays to consider several of these &#8220;effect periods&#8221; to (perhaps) coin a term.  </p>
<p>The third problem I have with your bets is that, frankly, it takes too long to find out who won.  Professor Henderson indicates in one post that he&#8217;ll probably be settling up with the estate of fellow bettor.  If bets are intended as a way to help move the field, not to say the bettors beliefs, forward, results have to come in more quickly to make an appreciable difference.  Now, at first glance, this last complaint kind of clashes with my previous criticism that ten years of data is just not enough.  But if you think about it, there&#8217;s an easy way to square the circle:  the obvious solution is to bet on outcomes that occurred on the past.  </p>
<p>Now, before you say that&#8217;s silly, hear me out.  You wouldn&#8217;t (dare I say couldn&#8217;t?) be a libertarian if you didn&#8217;t believe that historically, economic growth in the US was faster when the marginal income tax rates on what you would term the productive class were lower than when they were higher.  And in the unlikely event you&#8217;ve read anything I&#8217;ve written, whether on the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Presimetrics</a> or <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Angry Bear</a> blogs, or the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">book</a> I cowrote with Michael Kanell, you would be aware that I am pretty certain the US economy is not characterized by such a relationship between marginal tax rates and economic growth.  Simply put, what each of us knows about the past contradicts what the other knows.  At least one of us has to be wrong.  </p>
<p>Given how bet-happy you all are, and your core beliefs, I would have expected you to propose this one (not necessarily to me, who you no doubt don&#8217;t know from Adam) a long time ago.  To be precise, here&#8217;s the bet I would have expected you to issue:</p>
<blockquote><p>For the vast majority (say, at least 70%) of overlapping windows, the correlation between <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">top marginal individual income tax rate</a> and the growth in <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">real GDP</a> will be negative.  Windows of data to be considered are ten years long, twenty years long, etc., through sixty or seventy years long.  Growth rates to be compared with marginal tax rates at time period t include t &#8211; 1 to t, t to t+1, t to t+2, t to t+3, t to t+4, and t to t+5.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, I could see variations of that bet.  For instance, Professor Henderson has indicated in a recent working paper that he doesn&#8217;t believe National Accounts data for the WW2 years are accurate, so perhaps he would structure the bet to only use data from 1946 on, rather than the 1929 on which is possible with the official BEA data.  Alternatively, perhaps t to t+5 might seem a little much to consider, or perhaps one would prefer to include t to t+x where x is something larger than 5.  Nevertheless, this is very close to the bet I would have expected to be proposed from people with strong libertarian beliefs who like to engage in wagers on economic outcomes.  </p>
<p>One other thing &#8211; notice that I indicate the correlations should be negative well over half the time.  I have yet to hear a libertarian hedge when he/she tells me about the benefits of lower taxes.  Getting a touch above 50% just doesn&#8217;t fit that with that sort of certainty, and is more akin to random fluctuation, is it not?  (But don&#8217;t worry, where we&#8217;re going, the distinction between 50.00001% and something more appropriate to your level of certainty won&#8217;t matter.)  </p>
<p>What is left is to consider &#8211; what should have been the size of the bet we should have expected to see.  Now, Professor Caplan has recently noted:</p>
<blockquote><p>But why are small sums enough to deter 95%+ of the people who disagree with me?  I see two main reasons:</p>
<p>1. We aren&#8217;t just betting $100.  We&#8217;re betting $100 plus reputation plus bragging rights.  That&#8217;s why I prefer to bet the famous.  The Simon-Ehrlich victory wouldn&#8217;t have been nearly as awesome if Simon bet a random Malthusian.</p>
<p>2. Many spouses, perhaps most, disapprove of betting.  They think you&#8217;re irresponsible when you bet, and stupid when you lose.  Imagine how badly they&#8217;d react if the stakes were $25k!  Even the victor might find himself stuck in the doghouse.</p></blockquote>
<p>So&#8230; $100 plus bragging rights is about right.  Of course, I&#8217;m not famous, so I doubt the bet would have been issued to me.  I would have taken the $100 bet, though, if offered.  More &#8211; well, probably not, despite my certainty, given item number 2.  Nevertheless, I am surprised that neither of you offered this bet to someone.  </p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing.  You would have lost that bet.  And we&#8217;re not talking by a smidge, we&#8217;re talking by a country mile&#8230; or seventeen and a half.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what I get:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TPLmJFcjKAI/AAAAAAAAAdA/u_sNgo9rKFU/s1600/taxcuts1.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TPLmJFcjKAI/AAAAAAAAAdA/u_sNgo9rKFU/s320/taxcuts1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />by <strong>Mike Kimel</strong>Figure 1.</p>
<p>(Note &#8211; you might have to click on the figure to see it in full.  It seems to cut off on my browser.  The same is true of the next figure.)</p>
<p>The way to read this graph&#8230;.  consider the cell with t to t+3 on the horizontal and 50 years on the vertical.  That cell has 62.1% in it.  That indicates that of the 29 fifty year windows in which you can measure the growth in real GDP from a given year to three years later, 18 of them (or 62.1% of them) show a positive correlation between the top marginal tax rate.  That is to say, in 62.1% of those windows, growth is faster when top marginal tax rates are higher than when tax rates are lower.  </p>
<p>Notice&#8230;  most of the squares have numbers above 50% in them.  That means, in most situations we considered, more often than not, the correlations between marginal tax rates and growth rates are positive, not negative.  When the negative correlations do occur, they tend to occur over the very short term.  Put another way &#8211; they have negative repercussions that hit later.  (And yes, that is what the table indicates.)  Over longer periods of time, the percentage of time positive correlations are observed approaches 100%.  This cannot in any way be reconciled with libertarian theory. </p>
<p>FWIW, the table above represents a grand total of 1,652 observed correlations between the top marginal tax rate and growth rates of real GDP.  56.5% of those correlations are positive. </p>
<p>Note&#8230; I haven&#8217;t included it in the table, but for giggles I checked the t to t+10 results.  For ten and twenty year windows, the percentages are below 50%.  For thirty year windows and up, the percentages are above 50% and go above 70% at 40 year windows and hit 100% at the 70 year windows.  Put another way&#8230; t to t+10 looks an awful lot like t to t+4.  </p>
<p>Now, say you&#8217;re Professor Henderson and you want to discard the data through the end of WW2.  In  that case, you come out looking even worse:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TPLmJXP4wbI/AAAAAAAAAdI/uqKLBE7hTzw/s1600/taxcuts2.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TPLmJXP4wbI/AAAAAAAAAdI/uqKLBE7hTzw/s320/taxcuts2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>Now, 64.6% of all the correlations observed are positive.  </p>
<p>Now, this post is starting to get awfully long, so let me wrap it up.  I think you should offer this bet.  In fact, my advice to any libertarian or conservative is to offer to make this bet.  Sure, its easy for me to say, because the bet goes against you, but I promise if you offer the bet or something similar I will refrain from jumping in so I&#8217;m not making that suggestion for personal gain.  The reason I think you should offer this bet is that, knowing you&#8217;d lose gives only a few options:</p>
<p>1.  You can change your beliefs.  <br />2,  You can tapdance into the opposite result.  To some extent, that&#8217;s where the economic profession is now.  There are any number of studies by well known academics that show that cutting taxes lead to faster economic growth under some or most conditions, and they all require either weird special cases or assumptions that, frankly, could be used to show that a 400 year old sketch of a chicken is a nuclear submarine.  <br />3.  You can pretend none of this ever happened.<br />4.  You can show there is a problem with what I have done or proposed.</p>
<p>Now, its possible I&#8217;ve made a mistake, but to repeat myself, if you&#8217;ve read anything I&#8217;ve written before, you&#8217;ll find that I&#8217;ve been on a &#8220;the data shows that lower taxes do not equal faster economic growth&#8221; kick for a long time.  I&#8217;ve gotten here every which way, using data from all sorts of sources and at all levels of granularity. In this case, I&#8217;m guessing that if you included windows of 11, 12, 13, etc. years, you might push the percentage of positive correlations down.  For all I know, with judicious fiddling, you might even get to a point where a slight majority of cases have a negative correlation.  I don&#8217;t have an institute or a university paying me to make this sort of argument and I&#8217;m running out of spare time this afternoon.  But even if you got that percentage down a bit &#8211; the libertarian position is not that lower taxes lead to faster economic growth somewhere around half the time, is it?  And frankly, it would take a heck of a lot to get that number down for a Henderson post-WW2 look.   And no matter what, you aren&#8217;t going to escape one more detail &#8211; over longer periods of time, the correlations are overwhelmingly positive.  I&#8217;d hate be touting the benefits of lower taxes and having to explain that fact.  </p>
<p>Moving on, the problem with option 2, the status quo, or option 3, is that its simple enough to show what I&#8217;ve shown.  The results are there.  As noted above, I&#8217;ve done this sort of thing so many times, so many ways, with so many different data sets, and at so many levels of granularity.  Sooner or later someone that other folks do listen to will discover the same thing.  Then what?</p>
<p>As to option 1, well, Upton Sinclair said it best a long time ago, &#8220;It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his job depends on not understanding it.&#8221;  And frankly, its hard to see GMU or the Mercatus Institute or Hoover or even the blog where you write keeping you on if you start telling people that higher top marginal rates are correlated with faster economic growth.  You have a lot to lose if you change your beliefs.  </p>
<p>So if you can&#8217;t take any of these options, you really need a different approach.  And what&#8217;s better than going on the offensive?  Offer up the bet.  Sound confident- a true believer would insist that correlations between lower taxes and faster growth should be there 90% of the time, right?  Heck, issue odds.  Do that and people might assume you know the results favor your position.  People are lazy, and they don&#8217;t check.   That&#8217;s why so many people believe so many things that simply don&#8217;t hold up when confronted by data.  </p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/11/tax-cuts-and-deficit-commissions.html"><strong>Tax cuts and deficit commissions</strong></a><br />crossposted with <strong>Ataxingmatter</strong>
<p>The game continues, as Republicans hold out for tax cuts for the wealthy (who are garnering increasing amounts of the total income) and various &#8220;deficit commissions&#8221; put out austerity plans that all call for cutting Social Security benefits and Medicare benefits.</p>
<p>Alice Rivlin, who spoke here at my campus some time ago, seemed clearly to have cutting Social Security and Medicare in mind even then.  See A<a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/04/alice-rivlin-on-financial-reform-and-deficits.html">lice Rivlin on Financial Reform and Deficits, ataxingmatter</a>.  She is now &#8220;trying to stir a debate&#8221; about a national sales tax, according to Bloomberg.  Przybyla, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-17/rivlin-proposes-6-5-national-sales-tax-as-part-of-deficit-reduction-plan.html">Rivlin Proposes 6.5% National Sales Tax as Part of Deficit-Reduction Plan</a>, Nov. 17, 2010.  See also Jackie Calmes, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/us/politics/17fiscal.html">New Deficit Reduction Plan from Bipartisan Group</a>, NY Times, Nov. 17, 2010.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now Rivlin is one of those Clintonites who is a right-center Democrat and, like so many of the Clinton and Obama advisers, close to the banking elite as a former Federal Reserve vice chairperson.  She claims her plan would be good for the country, but it isn&#8217;t so clear to me.  Growth for growth&#8217;s sake, we learn, doesn&#8217;t work very well.  Tax cuts for businesses don&#8217;t necessarily translate into US economic growth&#8211;they may just lead to higher executive compensation and bigger buybacks of shares for shareholders.  Tax cuts for the wealthy don&#8217;t lead to more jobs:  the claim that &#8220;small businesses&#8221; are helped when their owners aren&#8217;t forced to pay the piddling (for them) additional taxes that would be due if the Bush cuts for the wealthiest were not renewed is a farce&#8211;there are very few businesses that even fall into the wealthy owner category, and those businesses aren&#8217;t likely to invest a penny more in jobs just because their owners get even wealthier with bigger tax cuts.</p>
<p>The Rivlin plan is a combination of significant tax cuts (lowering corporate rates, even though corporations&#8217; effective tax rates are already at the international norm and perhaps lower if all is taken into account), freezing domestic spending (even though the unemployed, underemployed and vulnerable elderly and poor will need more support, not less, and even though infrastructure projects require additional funding and everything from education to food and drug inspection to disease control are already short-staffed); limit federal spending on health care for the elderly while raising Medicare premiums, eliminate most deductions and credits, cut the Social Security benefits (changing the cost-of-living adjustments and reducing growth in benefits for the top 25% of beneficiaries), give a one-year Social Security payroll tax holiday (aimed, I wager, to make Social Security look like it is insolvent and therefore in need of cuts and privatization), and add a national sales tax of 6.5% (terribly regressive).</p>
<p>The claim is that this combination of tax and spending cuts with the sales tax will increase economic growth and therefore create jobs.  I&#8217;m not convinced. </p>
<p>Even Bloomberg&#8217;s reporter recognizes that the real purpose of these sorts of trial balloons is to &#8220;paint[] an even starker picture of the measures needed to tame the debt&#8221; and thereby &#8220;sell unpopular remedies&#8221;.    Aha.  The real purpose for Rivlin&#8217;s new visibility is as the &#8220;bad cop&#8221; of the bad cop-good cop act that has as its goal to sell Americans on the need to end Social Security as we know it, to cut back on our societal commitment to provide decent medical care to the aged, and to carry out even more tax cuts for the benefit of our growing oligarchic class.  Yet the Social Security funds&#8211;paid in by workers and their employers&#8211;have been used to reduce the federal operating deficit for years, a process that was carred to extremes under Bush to fund the Bush tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.</p>
<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341cf2a753ef013489295d69970c-pi"><img title="Federal deficit and Soc Sec Surpluses.OMB. 2010-11-09-Screenshot20101109at5_12_30PM" border="0" alt="Federal deficit and Soc Sec Surpluses.OMB. 2010-11-09-Screenshot20101109at5_12_30PM" src="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341cf2a753ef013489295d69970c-800wi"></a>    <br />Source: OMB via <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-fiderer/the-bush-tax-cuts-and-the_b_781419.html">Huffington Post</a></p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t Rivlin just support changing the current funding mechanism for Social Security so that it will be a tax on 100% of wages and on capital gains, as is Medicare?  Why not support nonrenewal of the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans?  Why not support continued tightening of the corporate tax code, including restrictions on tax-free reorganizations that permit US multinationals to grow bigger and richer and more powerful (and too big to fail)?  Why not recognize that the deficit isn&#8217;t nearly as bad a problem as the increase in inequality in our country and the potential for an oligarchic takeover of our society? </p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t jobs the real need, whether or not we do something now or later to limit the deficit?  Shouldn&#8217;t we spend money to create jobs, if we have to?  Infrastructure and education are two public goods that the government can fund while at the same time creating jobs.  We can worry about the deficit later.  Or we can just decide not to renew any of the Bush tax cuts.  Nobody was clamoring for tax cuts when the Republicans pushed the first through in 2001, so let them go and we&#8217;ll all be back more or less where we were then.  We&#8217;ll manage.   If you don&#8217;t think so, look at this Tax Policy Center (Urban Institute/Brookings Institution) <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/General_Explanation_CL_CP.cfm">analysis of the impact of the expiration of the 2001-2003 Tax Cuts</a>.  Extending the cuts would result in an average effective tax rate reduction for all taxpayers of 2.7 percentage points (&#8220;current policy&#8221;) compared with letting them expire (&#8220;current law&#8221;).  Renewing the cuts gives the biggest cuts, both in dollar and percentage points, to the highest income taxpayers.</p>

<p>If raising taxes on the rich is not possible politically now and raising taxes on the middle class possibly hard on the recovery, then at least do nothing other than extend them for a year or two while the country gets back on its feet.  And then let them go, along with a repeal of the preferential rate for capital gains and the extension of Social Security to full income.  Problem solved, and people put back to work. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Republicans are intent on letting the deficit go wherever so long as they can get the tax cuts they want most&#8211;for the wealthiest taxpayers amongst us. See, e.g., MichaelTomasky&#8217;s Blog, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2010/nov/17/congress-useconomy-tax-battle-lines-drawn">Tax Battle Lines Drawn</a> (Nov. 17, 2010).   Camp, Republican from Michigan, says the GOP would be &#8220;foolish&#8221; to go along with any idea to renew tax cuts for 80% of Americans without giving a tax break to the wealthy at the same time.  Everybody knows that the GOP wants to make those Bush tax cuts that were designed to expire into permanent reductions in tax revenues.  See e.g. (but note my &#8220;caution&#8221; below),  <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=40011">Will Obama Extend the Bush Tax Cuts?</a>, Human Events (Nov. 16, 2010) (indicating that &#8220;Republicans said they are still determined to make all of the Bush tax cuts permanent, rejecting White House overtures to decouple the top rates for a shorter extension&#8221;).  And the biggest beneficiaries are the GOP&#8217;s primary backers&#8211;the wealthy and big business&#8211;not the jobless.  See, e.g., &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/16/AR2010111607468_pf.html">GOP to Jobless: Drop Dead</a>&#8220;, Washington Post (Nov. 16, 2010).</p>
<p>(<em>CAUTION</em>&#8211;the &#8220;human events&#8221; blog just cited is a right-wing propaganda sheet scattered with contextually faulty or otherwise typically misleading statements , such as claiming that the scheduled expiration of the Bush cuts &#8220;could plunge the economy into another recession&#8221; or quoting Michael Steele in saying that the Republicans are fighting to &#8220;permanently stop the Democrats&#8217; tax hikes&#8221; &#8211;even though, of course, the scheduled expiration of the Bush tax cuts was designed by the Republicans as a way to fool the people about the actual multi-trillion-dollar cost and if the expiration of the Bush cuts according to schedule is a tax hike (which I&#8217;d dispute), it is a Republican one and not a Democratic one). </p>
<p>Polls fairly consistently show that Americans think at least the cuts for the wealthy should expire and possibly the cuts for all of us.   A recent poll shows that about a third of Americans think we shouldn&#8217;t renew any of the tax cuts, and another third think that at least we shouldn&#8217;t renew the tax cuts on the wealthy&#8211;that means that there&#8217;s a 2-1 vote against renewing the tax cuts for the wealthy.   See Steinhauser, <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/09/14/do-americans-want-to-extend-tax-cuts-for-wealthy-2/">Do Americans Want to Extend Tax Cuts for the Wealthy?</a>, CNN Politics, Sept. 14, 2010.  As noted in that article, another poll  (Gallup/USA Today)showed 44% want to roll back the cuts for wealthy Americans and 15% want the cuts to expire for everybody (including wealthy Americans), so also a 2-1 vote against renewing tax cuts for the wealthy. </p>
<p>And rightly so.  Because there is no way that renewing the tax cuts will be a significant stimulus to the economy nor any way that failure to renew them will hurt &#8220;small businesses&#8221;.  See, e.g., Fisher, <a href="http://www.aolnews.com/opinion/article/the-economics-of-extending-bushs-tax-cuts/19577979">The Economics of Extending Bush&#8217;s Tax Cuts</a>.  On the other hand, not renewing the cuts for the wealthy would do wonders for the economy&#8211;it would give us about $800 billion over ten years, &#8220;enough to pay for all veterans&#8217; hospitals, doctors, and the rest of the Veterans Affairs health system, plus the United States Coast Guard, plus the Food and Drug Administration, plus the operation and maintenance of every single national park for the entire 10-year period&#8211;with more than $100 billion left over.&#8221; Id (quoting Michael linden at the Center for American Progress).</p>

                                <p>by: Daniel Becker</p>
<p>This is a simple little exercise that frankly I wonder why no one with a pulpit (that would be you congress critters, executive office and MSM) has done it. It is for those who think simplistically. Thinking like:  wealthy people create jobs with their extra money and not the non-wealthy people&#8217;s demand for stuff that makes them feel wealthy.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say that tax cuts create jobs.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/extending-tax-cuts-for-wealthy.html">770,000 jobs</a>  for what is it, $4 trillion over 10 years? The obvious question is: How many jobs do we really need for that money to break even? Come on conservatives, you&#8217;re suppose to be the &#8220;efficient minded&#8221; thinkers. How many jobs would it take to pay it back? <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Median household income for 2009 is $49,777. 5% less than the peak of 1999 by the way. Full time working men it was $47,127, women $36,278. Per capita income was $26,530. These numbers are from <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/2010pubs/p60-238.pdf">here</a>.  </p>
<p>Using the household income number just because, in 10 years, you would need <strong>80,358,389</strong> jobs created to equal the tax cut.. Eighty plus million jobs. Of course, that we created these jobs does not mean all that money is paying for the $4trillion in lost tax collections. Only a percentage of the income is collected by We the People as income tax. Based on the <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/news/show/250.html">Tax Foundations data</a> that figures out to an average of 12.68% of taxable income paid as income taxes. Thus, $6,311.72 is paid for income tax for the median household income.</p>
<p>Stay with me here, this is simple. $4 trillion divided by $6311.72 is: <strong>633,741,674</strong> jobs in ten years. About double our total population in 10 years needs to be working. </p>
<p>Our policies have to start producing 63,374,674 jobs as soon as the tax cuts are passed, at the beginning of each year (&#8217;cause we need to collect the full $6311.72 at the end of each year) to pay for the tax cut. That is over the year, we need the equivalent of 63,374,674 jobs each having generated $49,777 of taxable income to make the mark for paying off the tax cut for that year. Not every job will pay that much for the year, so we actually need more than 63,374,674 jobs. That is, unless magically at one tick past midnight New Years Eve suddenly we have those jobs paying at that rate. </p>
<p>Sixty three million jobs per year. Really? Come on, you think this is possible? This nation is gonna need a lot more copulation and immigration happening over the next ten years for that to happen. </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say it is possible, just not here. China?</p>
<p>Not even in<a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010-09/18/content_11320661.htm"> China</a> can do it, as they only managed 22 million jobs in 2 years . Though they did manage to provide 112 million more willing workers over the last 10 years. Problem is, even at 22 million jobs, those sure are not at a median income of <a href="http://siakhenn.tripod.com/capita.html#C">$49,777/year</a>.</p>
<p>So.  Really&#8230; tax cuts? LOL. Pay for them with job creation? Oh please, you&#8217;re kill me!</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Linda Beale</strong><br />crossposted with Ataxingmatter</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/09/extending-the-tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy-the-discussion-continues.html"><strong>Extending the tax cuts for the wealthy&#8211;the discussion continues</strong></a></p>
<p>The New York Times asked me for my views of Robert Samuelson&#8217;s recent argument in the Washington Post that extending the tax cuts for the wealthy made sense because they would otherwise cut back their spending, tax cuts for them will create jobs (770,000, he claims) and not extending the tax cuts would raise taxes on &#8220;small&#8221; businesses and thus &#8220;discourage hiring and expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>The discussion appears in the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2010/09/27/tax-cuts-the-trickle-down-argument">New York Times &#8220;Room for Debate&#8221;</a> forum on the trickle down argument, at Hey Big Spenders: The Trickle-Down Argument, Sept. 27, 2010.</p>
<p>Here at ataxingmatter I&#8217;ll add some introductory context, which is somewhat harsher on Samuelson and his claim to question &#8220;the ritual of sound-bite economics&#8221; than the short form posted at the New York Times.</p>
<blockquote><p>Robert Samuelson claims to sound a voice of reason, but he is merely part of an increasing cacophony of ideological extremism.</p>
<p> He starts with a distorted sound-bite—that “the left sees salvation only in ever-larger government … [that] threatens long-term economic growth through higher taxes, regulations or budget deficits.”  I&#8217;d say rather that the left questions the right’s theories behind expanding government intrusions on individual rights and bloating government warmongering rather than relying on the likely more successful and certainly less costly art of diplomacy.  On the other hand, the right pushes for deregulation no matter the record of negligence and active harm caused by reliance on so-called industry self-regulation or the harm that ensues from inadequate prudential behavior, which we so amply witnessed in the financial meltdown and broader economic crisis of the Great Recession.  Similarly, the right is schizophrenic on budget deficits—favoring them to provide tax cuts for mega-corporations and wealthy Americans who can amply manage without them, but bemoaning even uncertain future deficits from programs benefitting ordinary Americans, such as Social Security.</p>
<p> Samuelson then attacks Obama as “subvert[ing] confidence” because he “fights Wall Street bankers, oil companies, multinational firms, health insurers and others.”  These titans of commerce began the fight when they retained all productivity growth for their owners and managers at the expense of ordinary Americans.  Health insurers benefited by denying coverage, or delaying payment.  Multinationals drained the federal fisc through transfer pricing games, tax credit manipulation and other tax shelters.  Oil companies polluted waters and fisheries to save a few bucks on safer deep sea drilling and companies continue in their efforts to stymy legislative action to regulate questionable fracturing procedures to extract natural gas from shale.  Wall Street bankers profited immensely from speculation in a casino financial system with interconnected and layered risks at the expense of the non-financial heart of the economy.</p>
<p>Then Samuelson spouts the worn arguments from Reaganomics for letting the rich avoid a fair share of the tax burden, even while they garner an ever increasing share of the nation’s wealth.

                                <p>We do know from Mike Kimel&#8217;s <em>Presimetrics</em> that the political message that tax cuts raise revenue is false.  In particular, here are two looks at the topic from data from the last decade.  It does appear that many want to continue what was done during this last decade&#8230;hold on to your wallet!!  </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.tax.com/taxcom/taxblog.nsf/Permalink/CHAS-89LPZ9?OpenDocument">David Cay Johnston</a> at Tax.com notes (h/t Mark Thoma):</p>
<blockquote><p>Just as they did in 2000, the Republicans are running this year on an economic platform of tax cuts, especially making the tax cuts permanent for the richest among us. So how did the tax cuts work out? My analysis of the new data, with all figures in 2008 dollars:</p>
<p>Total income was $2.74 trillion less during the eight Bush years than if incomes had stayed at 2000 levels. &#8230;</p>
<p>Even if we limit the analysis by starting in 2003, when the dividend and capital gains tax cuts began, through the peak year of 2007, the result is still less income than at the 2000 level. Total income was down $951 billion during those four years. <br />Average incomes fell. Average taxpayer income was down $3,512, or 5.7 percent, in 2008 compared with 2000, President Bush&#8217;s own benchmark year for his promises of prosperity through tax cuts. &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Issues/Taxes/2010/09/17/Bush-Tax-Cuts-No-Economic-Help.aspx">Bruce Bartlett</a> at Fiscal Times notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans are heavily invested in permanently extending the tax cuts enacted during the George W. Bush administration, all of which expire at the end of this year exactly as the legislation was written in the first place. To hear Republicans, one would think that the Bush tax cuts were the most powerful stimulus to growth ever enacted and only a madman would even think of allowing any of them to expire.</p>
<p>The truth is that there is virtually no evidence in support of the Bush tax cuts as an economic elixir. To the extent that they had any positive effect on growth, it was very, very modest. Their main effect was simply to reduce the government’s revenue, thereby increasing the budget deficit, which all Republicans claim to abhor.<br />&#8230;<br />Contrary to Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax cut, which was a simple across-the-board marginal tax rate reduction, the Bush plan was a hodge-podge of tax gimmicks designed more to win the support of various voting blocs than stimulate growth.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>The Ryan Budget Roadmap was introduced in January, and then sank like a stone. But with Ryan&#8217;s appointment to the Catfood Commission it and its author have drawn some new attention which borders on fawning. Or at least part of the plan has drawn attention, that part which would privatize Social Security and voucherize Medicare. What is getting less attention is his radical tax plan which if fully implemented would mean inheritors of great wealth would never pay federal taxes. EVER.</p>
<p>To set the background we have this article from the WaPo Monday <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/01/AR2010080103518.html">Rep. Ryan pushes budget reform, and his party winces</a> And it turn frames it as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Instead, Ryan is running a campaign of a different sort, one his party has so far refused to adopt: He is determined to persuade colleagues to get serious about eliminating the national debt, even if it means openly broaching overhauls of Medicare and Social Security.</p>
<p>He speaks in apocalyptic terms, saying the debt is &#8220;completely unsustainable&#8221; and warning that &#8220;it will crash our economy.&#8221; He urges fellow politicians, and voters, to stop pretending that this problem will go away on its own.</p>
<p>He administers his sermons with evangelical zeal. He will go anywhere and talk to anyone who will listen. When he is not writing op-eds and appearing on television, he can often be found speaking to liberal and conservative audiences alike about his &#8220;Roadmap for America&#8217;s Future,&#8221; a plan he says would fix the problem.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what is step one and two in cutting &#8220;completely unsustainable&#8221; debt? Well slashing Social Security and Medicare. And step three? ELIMINATE ALL TAXATION FOR BILLIONAIRES AND THEIR HEIRS. Details directly from Ryan&#8217;s website under the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The main page for the Roadmap is here: http://www.roadmap.republicans.budget.house.gov/ If we go to the tax reform page we get the following (bolding mine):<br />
<blockquote>This plan discards a needlessly complex and manipulative tax code, replacing it with a simplified mechanism that promotes work, saving, and investment.</p>
<p>Provides individual income tax payers a choice of how to pay their taxes – through existing law, or through a highly simplified code that fits on a postcard with just two rates and virtually no special tax deductions, credits, or exclusions (except the health care tax credit).<br />Simplifies tax rates to 10 percent on income up to $100,000 for joint filers, and $50,000 for single filers; and 25 percent on taxable income above these amounts. Also includes a generous standard deduction and personal exemption (totaling $39,000 for a family of four).<br />Eliminates the alternative minimum tax [AMT].<br />Promotes saving by eliminating taxes on interest, capital gains, and dividends; also eliminates the death tax.<br />Replaces the corporate income tax – currently the second highest in the industrialized world – with a border-adjustable business consumption tax of 8.5 percent. This new rate is roughly half that of the rest of the industrialized world.</p></blockquote>
<p> First thing to note is that this plan for &#8216;simplification&#8217; sets up two parallel tax systems, allowing people to stay on the existing one if they like. Considering that just about everyone would get a  tax cut under the new system why even have this provision in? Because Ryan can only make his revenue projections by assuming that most people will willingly stay on the old system and pay more taxes. But that headshaker pales in comparison to the implications of the text I bolded.</p>
<p>These provisions are billed as encouraging &#8216;savings&#8217;, but on inspection &#8216;savings&#8217; here goes far beyond a worker&#8217;s 401k, it includes ALL investment by anyone including billionaires like Peter G Peterson and Warren Buffett. Because while you can get to be a millionaire by being paid direct compensation by your employer and even a multi-millionaire you don&#8217;t become a billionaire that way, instead billionaires get their money from a combination of dividends, asset sales (capital gains), regular interest, and in some cases &#8216;carried interest&#8217;. Under the Ryan Roadmap all of that would be 100% tax free as would passing it on to your heirs. In turn that would mean that all inheritors and their heirs in turn could if they choose live their whole lives without paying a penny in federal taxes, as distributions from their trust funds would all come in the form of dividends, asset sales, and interest. And of course they would get full enjoyment of all real and personal property accumulated: mansions, art collections, yachts, jewelry, after a couple of generations even the Queen of England might get jealous of all your swag.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t a deficit reduction plan, this is a Randian wet dream that would reward the &#8216;Producers&#8217; (here defined as the Trustafarian class living off of grandpa&#8217;s wealth) at the total expense of the &#8216;Parasites&#8217; (that is though people actually contributing to future productivity via labor). This is what passes for &#8216;serious&#8217;, for &#8216;intellectual&#8217;, for &#8216;courageous&#8217; in the Republican Party today. BOLD ENOUGH TO GIVE 100% TAX BREAKS TO BILLIONAIRES.</p>
<p>Note that there is no hint of this in the WaPo article. Now I might have just let this WaPo article pass as being, after all old news, except this Ryan worship seems to be coming a trend. Because CNN followed up with this puff piece this morning <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/us/politics/03ryan.html?hpw">A Young Republican With a Sweeping Agenda</a><br />
<blockquote>In this highly charged election season with both houses of Congress at stake, not a lot of politicians are lining up publicly behind Mr. Ryan. He is, nonetheless, suddenly a rising star in some corners. And like many other politicians whose ideas were once considered extreme, only to later be mainstream — like Ronald Reagan — Mr. Ryan is seen as on the leading edge of something.</p>
<p>Why? His “Roadmap for America’s Future,” an elaborate (critics say drastic) plan that aims to erase the federal debt by 2063, simplify the tax code and significantly alter (his critics say eviscerate) Medicare and Social Security. When asked to handicap the 2012 Republican presidential field, Sarah Palin called Mr. Ryan “sharp.” Newt Gingrich dubbed him “extraordinarily formidable.” And, in a column, George Will imagined him as vice president to a President Mitch Daniels (now the Republican governor of Indiana).</p>
<p>Mr. Ryan, 40 and the ranking Republican on the House budget committee, has been in Congress 12 years, but it may have been President Obama who gave him and his Roadmap the broadest attention yet. This year, Mr. Obama alluded to the plan as a “serious proposal,” though the White House promptly made it clear that it had problems with its details.</p></blockquote>
<p>Just kill me now. This plan that proposes to cut almost all taxation on capital, and all taxation on individual holders of capital,  is billed as &#8216;simplification&#8217;, as something that in time might be seen as &#8216;mainstream&#8217;, that even Obama is willing to dub a &#8216;serious proposal&#8217; although he might have some &#8216;problems with its details&#8217;. Ya think? Anyone want to calculate the cost of THIS proposal over the Infinite Future Horizon?</p>
<p>No one who had read through this plan and thought through the implications could take it seriously.<br />Many people in the major media and in the Beltway take it seriously.</p>
<p>Well it doesn&#8217;t take a lot of logical chops to complete this syllogism and draw the right conclusion. These people are fundamentally not serious, in large part because they know that the American people as a whole are not likely to hold them accountable for not doing their homework. Or maybe one of our crack commenters can explain how you describe a plan to slash trillions in tax on capital still can be scored as solving the long-term budget crisis. You can start with the CBO score of the Roadmap. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10851/01-27-Ryan-Roadmap-Letter.pdf">CBO: Letter to Congressman Ryan</a>. Why didn&#8217;t CBO notice and score the huge hold the Roadmap would blow in future revenue. Simple, they were instructed to ignore it (bolding mine) .<br />
<blockquote>Other Tax Provisions. The proposal would make significant changes to the tax system. However, as specified by your staff, for this analysis total federal tax revenues are assumed to equal those under CBO’s alternative fiscal scenario (which is one interpretation of what it would mean to continue current fiscal policy) until they reach 19 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2030, and to remain at that share of GDP thereafter.</p></blockquote>
<p> Although in truth it is not all just supply-side fairy dust, because the plan does raise some significant revenue. By putting new taxes on labor.<br />
<blockquote>The Roadmap would also eliminate the income and payroll tax exclusions for employment-based health insurance. As a result, more earnings would become taxable for Social Security purposes, thus boosting future benefit payments, and payroll tax revenues credited to the Social Security trust funds would increase.</p></blockquote>
<p> Yep, even if you don&#8217;t earn enough to actually be exposed to income tax, you get to pay a payroll sur-tax from the first dollar on the value of your employer supplied health insurance (if any). The implications of this would require a post of their own.</p>
<p>Ryan Roadmap: Cut taxes on the rich, increase taxes on the poor. Now that is tax simplification we can all believe in! (Not).</p>

                                <p>We have seen the argument from some commission participants (Peterson for one) that Social Security is too expensive for those who need it and pay for it because it is an &#8216;entitlement&#8217;.  We also have read from some Congress members (Senators Kyl and McConnel) that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/07/tax-cuts-and-republican-leaders.html">tax cut extensions</a> of the Bush presidency are not deficit producing and need not be part of pay go.</p>
<p>The Fiscal Times has an <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Issues/Budget-Impact/2010/07/29/Deficit-Reduction-Commission-Begins-to-Focus-More-on-Taxes.aspx">article</a> on considerations being undertaken by the Commission for Deficit Reduction. (H/t coberly).</p>
<p>The main theme in this article is that the &#8220;tax expenditures&#8221; home mortgage deduction and health insurance premium deductions are actually government spending (I assume in relation to the deficit) and thereby letting these taxpayers keep their money is bad.  (Because these are &#8220;tax expenditures&#8221; and not &#8220;tax cuts&#8221;?)</p>
<p>I see a pattern here unfolding in this series of electioneering statements. Maybe politicians can put it altogether for us before the elections so we know who should pay and who should not in a less confusing way.</p>
<p>Quote is below the fold, bolding is mine:<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>
<blockquote>As the 18-member bipartisan panel met in public for the fifth time, it was becoming clear that the tax system is under its microscope and there are many ideas under review for the long term. The commission&#8217;s success has always hinged on whether its leaders could muster support among Republicans for changes to the tax system, and agree to major spending cuts and changes in Social Security, Medicare and other entitlement programs that dominate the budget. So far, the GOP members are still at the table.</p>
<p>The <strong>most obvious target</strong> is recovering the huge amounts of revenue lost to federal tax loopholes known as “tax expenditures,” which include the home mortgage interest deduction and tax-free health premiums for employees. <strong>Proponents of rolling back these breaks say they are essentially government spending via the tax code.</strong> But health care premiums and mortgage deductions have long histories and are considered untouchable by some.  </p>
<p>Erskine Bowles, one of the commission&#8217;s co-chairmen, pointed out that these loopholes cost the Treasury as much as $1.3 trillion per year, which is larger than total tax revenue. Bowles, citing an op-ed by Reagan White House economist Martin Feldstein, suggested that tax expenditures must be part of any serious attempt to limit spending. </p>
<p>Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, told the commission that the current system of tax expenditures is &#8220;one of the most detrimental things to the country.&#8221; But she also pointed out that they would be among the more difficult programs to touch.</p>
<p>Senate Budget Committee chairman Kent Conrad, D-N.D., who leads the commission&#8217;s working group on taxes, said that he has become convinced that more comprehensive tax reform is necessary to update a system that was built for an era in which the United States did not face global competition. &#8220;My own conclusion from this [working group review] is that we really have a tax system that is badly outdated,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It no longer relates to a world that we are in today.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to massive lost revenue through tax expenditures, the Treasury loses another $340 billion or so each year in taxes that people owe but simply do not pay, Conrad pointed out. &#8220;These are things that require a focus in our work.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
