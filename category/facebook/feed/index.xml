				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are as cynical as I am, I know you are not surprised that Facebook <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/dec/23/facebook-tax-profits-outside-us">paid Irish taxes</a> (via <a href="http://taxjustice.blogspot.com/2012/12/links-dec-27.html">Tax Justice Network</a>)  of about $4.64 million on its entire non-US profits of $1.344 billion  for 2011.* This 0.3% tax rate is a bit below the normal, already low,  Irish corporate income tax of 12.5%.</p>
<p>As with <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/04/whiny-apple-pioneered-avoidance.html">Apple</a>, Facebook funnels its foreign profits into its Irish subsidiary. As the <i>Guardian</i> article explains:<br />
<blockquote>Facebook is structured so that companies buying advertisements on the  website in the UK, or anywhere outside of the US, have to pay Facebook  Ireland.</p></blockquote>
<p>As a result, Facebook manages to slash its  taxes in other countries, paying, for example,  $380,800 in British tax  on estimated 2011 UK profits of $280 million, or a little over 0.1%.  What is shocking is that Facebook paid so much Irish tax since it  managed to convert its $1.3 billion gross profit into a net loss of $24  million.</p>
<p>As you&#8217;ve no doubt figured out, it&#8217;s that  &#8220;Double Irish&#8221; ploy again. Facebook operates a second subsidiary that is  incorporated in Ireland but controlled in the Cayman Islands. This  subsidiary owns Facebook Ireland, but the setup allows the two companies  to be considered as one for U.S. tax purposes, but separate for Irish  tax purposes. The Caymans-operated subsidiary owns the rights to use  Facebook&#8217;s intellectual property outside the U.S., for which Facebook  Ireland pays hefty royalties to use. This lets Facebook Ireland transfer  the profits from low-tax Ireland to no-tax Cayman Islands. For more on  the arcane mechanics, see Joseph Darby&#8217;s article &#8220;International Tax  Planning,&#8221; downloadable at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Irish_arrangement">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>This makes no sense of course, but is, in David Cay Johnston&#8217;s inimitable phrase, <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Perfectly_Legal.html?id=KZ-VCFhjGrgC">Perfectly Legal</a>. But it shouldn&#8217;t be. And in the UK, Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2012/dec/23/facebook-tax-profits-outside-us">has announced</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>a £154m [$246.4 million] blitz on tax avoidance and evasion, with HMRC [the British equivalent of the IRS] hiring an extra  2,500 tax inspectors to target high earners who aggressively exploit  loopholes to avoid or evade tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>The U.S. should do the same. </p>
<p>* Dollar figures converted from pound sterling figures in the <i>Guardian</i> at an exchange rate of $1.60 per pound.</p>
