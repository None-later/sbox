<p>The Plot Sickens – The Heart of the ACA Litigation Moves to the Supreme Court. </p>
<p>Maybe. Last week’s big political news concerning the PPACA (a.k.a. “Obamacare”) litigation was the administration’s decision to forego the option of asking the full membership of the Atlanta-based Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, the appellate for several southeastern states, to hear and reverse the mid-August opinion by two members of a three-judge panel of that court striking down the individual-mandate provision of the ACA as beyond the constitutionally permissible reach of the Commerce Clause, the “enumerated power” in the Constitution under which Congress enacted the statute.  </p>
<p>This surprised some political pundits, but because anyone thought a majority of the members of that most conservative of regional federal appellate courts would disagree with the ruling—except possibly the part holding that the mandate provision was “severable” from the remainder of the Act and that therefore the Act remained intact except for the mandate provision.  Instead, they thought that the Obama administration wanted (or, more accurate, should want) to delay a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality of the statute, especially the mandate provision, until after the election next fall.  And if the full appellate court agreed to dissolve the panel’s opinion and hear the case—a long shot, in my opinion—this would do the trick.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />At least, that is, if the Supreme Court denied or postponed consideration of the petition for Supreme Court review of a majority opinion of a three-judge panel of the Cincinnati-based Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, the appeals court for Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennesee, in late June, written by conservative Bush appointee Jeffrey Sutton, upholding the constitutionality of the mandate provision.  Sutton’s opinion meticulously and eloquently deconstructed the plaintiffs’ arguments—which are the same as those by the individual human plaintiffs in all the other cases challenging the constitutionality of the individual mandate.  He famously explained: First, contrary to assertions, the real basis for the plaintiffs’ claim is not that Congress lacks the authority under the Commerce Clause to mandate that everyone who is financial able purchase healthcare insurance in order to help defray the inevitable costs of their own emergency medical care when need arises and care is sought, but rather that this mandate unconstitutionally infringes upon individual liberty to remain self-insured.  And, second, the structure of the statutory mandate—that the individual obtain the insurance from a private carrier—no more infringes upon that individual liberty than would the imposition of a tax similar to the Medicare and Social Security tax laws, paid to the government for that purpose. If the claim is a constitutional right, a constitutional liberty interest, in remaining self-insured—and that is the claim—then the infringement on individual liberty comes not from the mandated purchase of the insurance from a private party but instead from the removal of the option to remain self-insured.  </p>
<p>And any infringement on individual liberty doesn’t morph into an unconstitutional infringement on liberty simply because the enumerated power under which Congress enacted the statute was the power to regulate interstate commerce (the Commerce Clause) rather than the power to tax in order to provide for the general welfare (the Tax Clause).  And constitutional authority conferred through the Commerce Clause doesn’t become un-conferred by the Commerce Clause just because the statute limits individual liberty.  Conflating the two separate grounds, neither of which can stand on its own, doesn’t transform a constitutional statute into an unconstitutional one.  No alchemy here. </p>
<p>Sutton’s analysis exposes the constitutional challenges to the individual mandate for what they are: a series of ideological clichés masquerading as legal argument.  As I wrote in AB shortly after the Sutton opinion was released, his analysis is so fine, so precise, that ultimately the Supreme Court’s opinion will echo it.  So I was not among those who were surprised that the administration is pushing for a Supreme Court ruling on the constitutionality or the statute before the 2012 election.  But all the judges thus far who have voted to invalidate the individual-mandate provision as unconstitutional are, in my opinion, intellectual lightweights, and so I’d wondered whether the Sutton analysis itself could be persuasively deconstructed by a judge or justice who is not.  </p>
<p>The answer appears to be no.  Last week, a panel of yet federal appellate court, this one the one for Washington, D.C., heard arguments in yet another case challenging the constitutionality of the mandate as beyond Congress’s Commerce-regulation authority because it infringes upon the liberty of individuals to remain self-insured, it requires the purchase of a “product” from a private party, and, well, um, the scope of the statute is really sweeping.  I mean, what’s next, asked one of the two stalwart rightwing-intellectual-heavyweight members of the panel?  Congress mandating the purchase of GM cars by the wealthy in order to prevent the collapse of that company during the next economic downturn, upon pain of payment of a penalty for failure to do so?  (I hope so. Then, when David Koch has a heart attack in his Maserati and the ambulance attendants verify through the Secretary of State’s offices in his various home states that there is no GM car registered in his name, the attendants dump his gasping-for-breath body in the road, where he’s run over by a Cadillac SUV.) </p>
<p>A sigh of relief was in order—although I had to wait until I stopped smiling like a Cheshire cat.  That judge, Brett Kavanaugh (a former law clerk to Justice Kennedy, circa 1993), reportedly commented earlier to the plaintiffs’ lawyer that maybe the courts shouldn’t interfere with what could be the beginning of the mass privatization of the social safety net.  More likely, I think, it will prompt, finally, a single-payer healthcare-insurance system—Medicare for all—in order to cut out the spiraling costs of a private, multi-carrier, for-profit system whose premiums reflect, in part the investment losses of those private companies.  But don’t tell Judge Kavanaugh until after that appeal is over. </p>
<p>***** </p>
<p>Much as the administration and its many litigation opponents—which include 26 states, which are challenging another part of the statute—want a quick Supreme Court adjudication of the constitutionality of the statute, there is some possibility that the Supreme Court will hold that it lacks “subject-matter jurisdiction”—i.e., legal authority—to consider the challenges at least to the mandate provision until sometime in 2015, when the mandate provision becomes effective and the IRS collects the penalty.  This is pretty esoteric procedural stuff, and it was the subject of an earlier AB post of mine last spring in which I said I thought that outcome in the Supreme Court was unlikely.  But in early September a 2-1 majority of the Richmond, VA-based Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, the appellate court for the Carolinas, West Virginia and a couple of mid-Atlantic states, along with Virginia, last month ruled exactly that.  The issue concerns a federal “jurisdictional” statute called the Anti-Injunction Act (the AIA), and the Supreme Court’s interpretation of that statute in two opinions issued on the same day, concerning the current statute’s predecessor, in 1922.  </p>
<p>Sutton and his two colleagues rejected the argument.  And the dissenter in the Fourth Circuit case, Andre Davis, dismantled his colleagues’ analysis as absurd.  I agree Davis.  But as law prof. Brad Joondeph, who writes a blog devoted entirely to the ACA litigation, and who is featured prominently in AB posts of mine from last June, wrote recently, the language of the AIA, and the Supreme Court’s earlier opinions interpreting it, may not matter here.  </p>
<p>What might? If a majority of justices, for various reasons, want to punt on the issue of the constitutionality of the ACA until after—comfortably after—next year’s elections.  I don’t think they will.  But I’m probably wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Clement’s weird tail-can-morph-the-dog ACA-litigation argument</strong> </p>
<p>Earlier this month I wrote a post called “Markets and the ACA: Why the Supreme Court Will Uphold the ACA&#8221; that discussed an article-length post by Santa Clara constitutional law prof. Brad Joondeph published on a blog he runs dedicated entirely to the ACA litigation.  I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Santa Clara law prof. and ACA-litigation blogger Brad Joondelph is] right, but only if, as he says earlier, the market for health insurance is defined so narrowly that health insurance is viewed as a commodity, a product, independent of the product’s purpose and effect. And then, the constitutional issue would not, I think, be whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, to regulate the health insurance market, but instead whether this violates some other constitutional limitation. You know: the slippery-slope-to-government-compelled-consumption-of-broccoli argument.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I wrote that post and sent it to Dan a day or two before the oral argument in the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in what most commentators think is likely to be the ACA case that the Supreme Court will use to decide the constitutionality of the ACA.  Dan posted it a day after the argument.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs in that case are 26 states, two or three individuals, and an organization of small businesses.  Former Bush solicitor general and current top-notch private-practice appellate and Supreme Court litigator Paul Clement is representing the 26 states.  Another lawyer is representing the private plaintiffs.  </p>
<p>The oral argument featured a colloquy between Clement and Judge Stanley Marcus, the swing vote on the panel hearing that appeal, that caused me to write a follow-up to my “Markets and the ACA” post called “Ah! It’s not about regulating markets, after all!  It’s about regulating the individual!”  I said in that post that in light of what occurred at that oral argument, which was based on the several reports I’d read—I hadn’t read the transcript of the three-hour argument—it looks like I was on to something when I wrote in the earlier post that the constitutional issue might not be whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, to regulate the health insurance market, but instead whether this violates some other constitutional limitation.</p>
<p>Last week, I emailed Prof. Joondeph, told him about my posts, and asked what he thought of my analysis and my prediction that the case might be decided not on the issue of whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause (coupled with the Necessary and Proper Clause) to regulate the health insurance market but instead whether the individual-mandate provision violates some other constitutional limitation.  His response, which provided more information about what really transpired between Marcus and Clement, surprised me.  With his permission to publish it, here’s his response:</p>
<blockquote><p>Very nice to hear from you. And I&#8217;m glad you found at least some of my analysis mildly helpful.</p>
<p>I generally agree with your legal analysis: there seems to be virtually no way any court invalidates the ACA on substantive due process grounds. The notion that forcing someone to purchase a product against their will violates the &#8220;liberty&#8221; protected by the Due Process Clause has not had any real support since 1937, when the Court decided <i>West Coast Hotel</i>and ended the <i>Lochner</i>era. So that claim is going nowhere.</p>
<p>This is why the states have actually abandoned the claim (though they raised it in their initial complaint). So there literally is no chance for this claim. It is no longer a part of the case.</p>
<p>What Clement and Marcus discussed at argument was whether it was at all anomalous that the underlying objection to the mandate sounded in &#8220;liberty,&#8221; but that the legal challenge was framed along the dimensions of &#8220;powers.&#8221; Marcus thought it a bit strange. Clement argued it was not, as the federal structure of government is ultimately intended to protect individual liberty (as the Supreme Court has stated on several occasions).</p>
<p>Perhaps even more specifically, I think Marcus was wondering whether it made any sense to impose a &#8220;Congress can only regulate voluntary action&#8221; limitation on the commerce power, if that limitation stemmed principally from individual liberty concerns, rather than from a coherent conception of the scope of interstate commerce.</p>
<p>Not sure this directly responds to your questions. But those are my thoughts &#8212; coherent or otherwise. 🙂</p>
<p>All the best,<br />Brad</p></blockquote>
<p>Whoa.  Okay.  My response:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of my pet peeves as a political liberal is this claim by the conservative justices that federalism necessarily translates into a protection of individual liberty.  The Court is incessantly invoking federalist principals to keep the federal courts from intervening when states-especially state courts, but state legislatures too-infringe upon individual constitutional rights and upon individual liberty. Destroying individual liberty in order to save it, I guess.</p>
<p>During oral argument in February in the Supreme Court in Bond v. United States, the wacky case in which a biochemist tried to poison her former friend and current paramour of the biochemist&#8217;s husband, Kennedy said, &#8220;The whole point of separation of powers, the whole point of federalism, is that it inheres to the individual and his or her right to liberty; and if that is infringed by a criminal conviction or in any other way that causes specific injury, why can&#8217;t it be raised?&#8221;  What nonsense that the whole point of federalism is that it inheres to the individual and his or her right to liberty.  In <i>Bond</i>, it works that way.  In other cases, not so much.</p>
<p>Anyway &#8230; thanks for responding.</p>
<p>Best,<br />Beverly</p></blockquote>
<p><i>Lochner v. New York</i> is a 1905 Supreme Court case that invalidated a New York state labor law that limited the number of hours a baker could work per week to 60.  The Court said the statute violated the ‘liberty’ guarantee in the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause because it removed what the Court said was the constitutional right to contract freely.  </p>
<p>Back then, “substantive” due process—the right to make certain decisions without government interference—was limited to economic decisions.  In the 1960s, the Court expanded the concept to include the right to make certain deeply personal, non-economic decisions (such as the right to use contraceptives, to have an abortion under certain circumstances, to have homosexual sex) without government interference. Some modern legal conservatives, including four current Supreme Court justices, share the <i>Lochner</i>-era view that substantive due process protects only economic ‘liberty,’ and does so almost without limit.</p>
<p><i>Lochner</i> operated as a bar to most labor laws, until it was overturned in 1937 in a case called <i>West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish</i>, in which the Court upheld a Washington state minimum-wage statute and said the Constitution does not include an absolute right to contract freely.  The opinion held that states are entitled to restrict liberty of contract in order to protect the health and safety of the community or of vulnerable groups.</p>
<p>Clement, who was not involved in the case in the lower court, chose to drop the economic-substantive-due-process argument on appeal—if only ostensibly—presumably because he views the <i>West Coast Hotel</i> and the three quarters of a century of Supreme Court jurisprudence based on that opinion as having settled the matter.  No justice but Clarence Thomas would vote to overrule those precedents, even in order to void ‘Obamacare&#8217;.  </p>
<p>But Clement is attempting a really weird, and really dangerous, sleight of hand, and apparently Marcus saw through it.  If the individual mandate violates a constitutionally protected liberty interest, then the mandate is unconstitutional on that basis, irrespective of whether Congress had the authority to enact it as necessary and proper under the Commerce power.  And if the mandate doesn’t violate a constitutionally protected liberty interest, then substantive due process—individual liberty—can’t remove Congress’s authority to enact the mandate as necessary and proper under the Commerce power.  Conflating the two separate arguments doesn’t make it greater, constitutionally speaking, than the sum of its two separate parts.  </p>
<p>But if it does, we’re in for an interesting ride.  All that would be necessary to have the Court strike down any statute as beyond Congress’s authority under whatever the respective “enumerated” power under which the statute was enacted—the defense power; the taxing power; the spending power; whatever—would be to identify the relevant enumerated power and transform an unsuccessful substantive-due-process claim and an otherwise unsuccessful enumerated-powers claim into a successful enumerated-powers claim.  So long, Selective Service Act.  For example.  </p>
<p>Or maybe not. The Court’s 5-4 majority <i>could</i> limit the ruling to that one case.  That, of course, has it’s own precedent, called <i>Bush v.Gore</i>.</p>

<p>The day after my email exchange with Prof. Joondeph, the Court issued its opinion in <i>Bond</i>.  Kennedy wrote the opinion for a unanimous court.  Ginsburg wrote a separate concurrence, which Breyer joined.  </p>

<p><strong>Ah! It’s not about regulating markets, after all!  It’s about regulating the individual!</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>ATLANTA — In perhaps the weightiest of the dozens of challenges to the Obama health care law, a panel of appellate judges grappled Wednesday with the essential quandary of the case: if the federal government can require Americans to buy medical insurance, what constitutional limit would prevent it from mandating all manner of purchases and activities?<br />—<a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/09/us/politics/09arguments.html?_r=1&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=June+8%2C+2011+Kevin+Sack&#038;st=nyt">Kevin Sack, New York Times, Jun. 8</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In my last post, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/markets-and-aca-why-supreme-court-will.html">Markets and the ACA: Why the Supreme Court Will Uphold the ACA</a>, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>[Santa Clara law prof. and ACA-litigation blogger Brad Joondeph is] right (see my earlier post), but only if, as he says earlier, the market for health insurance is defined so narrowly that health insurance is viewed as a commodity, a product, independent of the product’s purpose and effect. And then, the constitutional issue would not, I think, be whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, to regulate the health insurance market, but instead whether this violates some other constitutional limitation. You know: the slippery-slope-to-government-compelled-consumption-of-broccoli argument.</p></blockquote>
<p>Turns out I was onto something.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Dan posted the post on Thursday, a day after the oral argument in the 11th Circuit court of Appeals in what is broadly viewed as the key ACA lawsuit because the plaintiffs include 26 states and because the trial-court judge, Pensacola-based Roger Vinson, struck down the entire ACA because he ruled that  the Act’s individual-mandate requirement is unconstitutional and said the entire statute is too dependent on the individual-mandate provision to “sever” that provision from the rest of the statute.  But I’d written my post on Tuesday, in anticipation of the oral argument, and posted it on my blog that day.</p>
<p>But from reports I’ve read about the oral argument on Wednesday, it looks to me like that appellate panel will decide the case not on the basis of the limits of the Commerce Clause but instead on a more general civil liberties ground.  They may cloak it as a Commerce Clause issue—and certainly that is what Paul Clement, the attorney representing the 26 states wants the court to do—but, really, given the questioning and comments from the swing judge on that appellate panel, and therefore the basis on which that panel will decide the case, this would be an improper conflation of Commerce Clause issues and what is known as “substantive due process” issues.  And I think, ultimately, it is the substantive due process question on which the Supreme Court will decide the case.  This is so even though conservative legal types detest the very concept of substantive due process.</p>
<p>Substantive due process is a doctrine of constitutional law that holds that there are limits, inherent within the Constitution, to the extent to which the government can interfere with basic personal choices, irrespective of how much procedural due process that individual is accorded.  It’s a concept completely independent of procedural due process—the right to due process of law before the courts can strip you of life, liberty or property.  </p>
<p>Procedural due process is all about the limits of what courts can do.  Substantive due process, by contrast, is almost always about the limits of what a legislature can do.  The doctrine holds that there are some personal choices that are inviolate under the Constitution.  It is the much-ridiculed-by-right-wingers legal principal on which <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was based.  Roe v. Wade, for its part, was based on a 1965 Supreme Court case called <i>Giswold v. Connecticut</i>, which created the substantive-due-process right of individuals to make deeply personal decisions for themselves and struck down as an unconstitutional violation of that privacy right a state statute that prohibited the use of contraceptives.  And it is the principal on which in an eloquent 2003 opinion, <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i>, by Justice Kennedy, the Court struck down Texas’s anti-sodomy criminal statute.  </p>
<p>Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas dissented in <i>Lawrence</i> on the ground that, in their view, there is no such substantive-due-process right—no privacy right concerning intimate personal decisions—in the Constitution.  Scalia and Thomas might change their minds, though, but only about the intimate decision not to buy health insurance, especially because that right is just too similar to the intimate right not to eat broccoli. </p>
<p>The 11th Circuit panel members are Joel Dubina, a conservative Reagan appointee to the district (trial-court level) court and a G.H.W. Bush appointee to the appellate court, whose daughter is a freshman Alabama congresswoman who campaigned on a promise to try to repeal the ACA; Frank (female, despite her name) Hull, a moderate Clinton appointee; and Stanley Marcus, a moderate-to-conservative G.H.W. Bush appointee to the district court and Clinton appointee to the appellate court. </p>
<p>According to one report I read, Marcus early in the hearing said he viewed the central issue in the case—the constitutionality of the individual-mandate provision—as less a Commerce Clause issue than a civil liberties issue: Does the mandate violate the civil liberties of individuals by requiring them to obtain healthcare insurance?  That’s a different question, and a broader one, I think, then whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, to mandate the purchase of healthcare insurance by those who can afford to buy it.  Congress may have that authority under the Commerce Clause, but the legislation still might be unconstitutional if it violates another provision of the Constitution, here presumably the substantive due process right to be compelled to buy something.  Presumably, because no one, least of all Clement, used the term “substantive due process right”.  But he sure the words “compel,” “liberty” and “individual.”  Early and quite often:<br />
<blockquote>“The Commerce Clause only gives Congress the power to regulate, not to compel.” …</p>
<p>“It boils down to the question of whether the federal government can compel people into commerce to better regulate the individual.” …</p>
<p>“In 220 years, Congress never saw fit to use this power, to compel a person to engage in commerce.” …</p>
<p>“The whole reason we do this is to protect individual liberty.” …</p></blockquote>
<p>When Hull said she believed the decision not to buy insurance involved some “economic activity” that impacts the healthcare market (and that therefore, under the Supreme Court’s interpretation of Commerce Clause powers, Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, coupled with the Necessary and Proper Clause, to regulate), Clement reportedly responded that, despite this, Congress has no constitutional authority to force people to act to buy coverage.</p>
<p>Clement attempts to thread a needle.  </p>
<p>In 2005, in <i>Gonzales v. Raich</i>, the Court held that under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, Congress has the power to prohibit an individual from growing marihuana, not for sale, much less for sale in interstate commerce but instead for his personal use, because this effects the interstate market for marijuana.  Only O’Connor and Thomas dissented.  The challengers to the constitutionality of the ACA’s individual-mandate provision have focused on the “compel” part; sure, the Congress can <i>prohibit activity</i> something under the Commerce Clause, but it can’t <i>compel activity</i> under the Commerce Clause.  But once you acknowledge that the failure to obtain health insurance impacts the interstate market for healthcare by directly impacting who pays the uninsureds’ emergency medical costs, you’ve pretty much conceded—logically, at least—that the Commerce Clause, assisted by the Necessary and Proper Clause, allows Congress to regulate this, irrespective of whether it does this by compelling the purchase of insurance or instead in some other way.  </p>
<p>This is true whether the acknowledger is the lawyer for the challengers to the constitutionality of the law or instead the judges hearing the case. </p>
<p>All three of the judges on that panel acknowledged the obvious: that the failure to obtain health insurance impacts the interstate market for healthcare by directly impacting who pays the uninsureds’ emergency medical costs.  And Clement didn’t deny it.  So much for, “It boils down to the question of whether the federal government can compel people into commerce to better regulate the individual.”  It boils down to that only if the federal government isn’t compelling people into commerce also to better regulate the healthcare-coverage market.  Most laws, federal as well as state and local ones—including the federal one at issue in <i>Raich</i>—regulate the individual.  Whether they better regulate the individual or not.</p>
<p>Clement understands this, of course, but also recognizes the need for a straw to grasp at other than the Commerce Clause one.  Thus the civil liberties straw, which the judges themselves offered the statute’s challengers even before Clement (who argued after the federal government’s lawyer, acting solicitor general Neal Katyal, did) began his argument: <br />
<blockquote>Marcus: “If they could compel this, what purchase could they not compel?” …</p>
<p>Dubina: “I can&#8217;t find any case like this. If we uphold this, are there any limits [on the power of the federal government]? …</p>
<p>Marcus: &#8220;I can&#8217;t find any case [in which the courts upheld the constitutionality of] telling a private person they are compelled to purchase a product in the open market&#8230;. Is there anything that suggests Congress can do this?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, no, not precisely.  But there <i>are</i> Supreme Court cases that upheld what, for civil liberties purposes, amounts to the same thing.  They’re the cases that upheld the constitutionality of the Social Security Act and the Medicare Act by allowing the government to compel contributions to these separate funds, which are not part of the general tax revenue fund (OK, in theory, anyway), for the sole purpose of insuring a retirement income and health insurance for those over age 65.  True, the specific “enumerated” Constitutional authority Congress used to enact those laws was the taxing power, not the commerce-regulation power.  But that matters only if the commerce-regulation power isn’t broad enough to reach this.  If it is—and under Supreme Court precedent, it is, if the failure to have health insurance significantly impacts the healthcare market, which it does—then this distinction is without a difference.  You know.  A <i>meaningful</i> (or as lawyers say, a <i>material</i>) difference. </p>
<p>In questioning Katyal, the judges were asking for a so-called “limiting principle,” a logical line beyond which federal regulatory authority cannot go.  But if the issue is individual liberty, is it really logical to have that line depend on whether the compelled payment is for a product in the open market rather than for a similar product issued by the government?  Isn’t the civil liberties issue really what the goal and effect are?  That’s certainly the issue in most civil-liberties challenge to the constitutionality of a statute.  Why isn’t it, here?</p>
<p>Blowing away the smokescreen erected by the focus on the individual-mandate provision’s use of private insurance—and isn’t it just a smokescreen, really?—why does this infringe on liberty more than the Social Security and Medicare taxes do? </p>
<p>The bottom line, in my opinion, is that the Commerce Clause gives Congress the power to regulate, <i>including</i> the power to compel, without infringing on civil liberties, if what Congress is compelling is what it could compel through its taxing power, without infringing on civil liberties.  Congress couldn’t (to use the conservatives’ preferred example) compel Americans, via the tax code, to eat broccoli.  Or to buy it.  That pretty clearly would violate substantive due process rights, a.k.a. individual liberty rights, even if under the taxing power Congress otherwise would have that authority.  But Congress could, for example, extend Medicare to all Americans and amend the Medicare tax law to pay for it, without violating the Constitution’s individual-liberty guarantees.  </p>
<p>That’s the limiting principle.  At least it should be.</p>
<p>Postscript regarding Paul Clement</p>
<p>In his May 8 article about Wednesday’s oral argument in the 11th Circuit in the ACA case in which Paul Clement is representing 26 states in challenging the constitutionality of the statute, New York Times reporter Kevin Sack wrote that those states are paying Clement $250,000 to handle the appeal in that court and eventually in the Supreme Court.  </p>
<p>That’s a stunning amount, even though the amount each state will pay is relatively small.  These are two appeals in a single case that involves, entirely, arguments of law.  There is no trial transcript, nor trial-court orders on motions, nor volumes of business records—the things that usually raise appellate legal fees to astronomical heights.  And the legal arguments are the standard ones being discussed ad nauseam in legal circles.  Clement’s hourly fee on this will turn out to be something close to $1,000, I’d bet. </p>
<p>Maybe lines like, “It boils down to the question of whether the federal government can compel people into commerce to better regulate the individual,” as he told the panel on Wednesday, makes this guy worth his price.  But if so, it’s only because the judges will assume that since he’s Paul Clement rather than, say, another lawyer, that line makes sense.</p>

<p><strong>‘Markets’ and the ACA: Why the Supreme Court Will Uphold the ACA</strong> </p>
<p>In my post last week about the activity/inactivity canard on which the challengers to the constitutionality of the ACA claim, I wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>In his [blog] post, [high-profile rightwing law professor Randy] Barnett pointed out something that was not in the other reports I’d read about [last month’s oral arguments in the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals]: that in a lengthy exchange with [acting Solicitor General Neal] Katyal, [Judge Diana Gribbon] Motz indicated that she buys the activity/non-activity distinction, because she believes the definition of the word “regulate” means “regulate activity.”  She kept insisting that if the failure to buy health insurance is inactivity rather than activity, then, under her understanding of the definition of the word “regulate,” Congress couldn’t regulate it. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Katyal flubbed the response to this.  Partly.  He noted the Supreme Court’s most recent relevant Commerce Clause/Necessary and Proper Clause decision, <i>Gonzales v. Raich</i>, a 2005 opinion that held that the federal statute enacted under the Commerce Clause powers that criminalizes the growing and use of marijuana applies even to homegrown marijuana that is not sold even intrastate, much less in interstate commerce, and that is just for the personal use of the grower.  The rationale: that even those actions impact the interstate market for marijuana.  Since the Commerce Clause gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate markets, Congress can, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, regulate things that otherwise cannot be regulated under the Commerce power if those things impact the interstate market.  </p>
<p>Motz, though, missed the point. Growing marijuana is an activity, she pointed out, so how is Raich relevant to whether Congress can, under the Commerce Clause together with the Necessary and Proper Clause, regulate inactivity, she wanted to know?  Well, um, maybe that what’s relevant isn’t the particular reason why the Commerce Clause alone isn’t enough and must be aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, but instead that if something—whether activity only within a state’s boundary, or instead inactivity, or instead whatever—impacts a market that Congress has the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate, then Congress has the constitutional authority to regulate it as necessary and proper under the Commerce Clause.<br />Katyal apparently was too dumbfounded to explain this.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power, in the Constitution’s precise words, “To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes.” It’s one of the “enumerated,” or specified, powers that the Constitution gives Congress, and which the Necessary and Proper Clause augments.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, Santa Clara U. law professor Brad Joondeph, who has a blog called “aca litigation blog,” wrote trenchantly as the opening paragraph of a lengthy post titled “The regulated activity”:</p>
<blockquote><p>Much ink has been spilled over whether Congress&#8211;using its commerce power alone, or its commerce power in conjunction with the Necessary and Proper Clause&#8211;has the authority to regulate &#8220;inactivity.&#8221; But there is a logically prior question&#8211;a question that is often quite tricky in enumerated powers cases&#8211;that must be resolved before reaching the inactivity issue. Namely, one has to define exactly what conduct Congress is regulating in the challenged provision.</p>
<p>[A] critical question that every judge must confront (or at least every judge reaching the merits) is whether the minimum coverage provision (a) regulates conduct in the <i>health insurance</i> market (as the challengers contend), or (b) regulates conduct in the <i>health care services</i> market (as the United States maintains).</p>
<p>In a direct and immediate sense, of course, the individual mandate regulates behavior in the insurance market. But one can easily argue (as with §4306 above) that what it <i>really</i> regulates is the payment for services in the health care service market. Sure, the provision, when examined in isolation, only directly concerns the purchase of health insurance. But the broader scheme, taken as a whole, shows that what Congress was actually regulating&#8211;of which the individual mandate is only a part&#8211;is the financing of health care services. Congress logically cared whether people carry health coverage not for its own sake, but due to its implications for the financing of services in the health care market, the ultimate object of its regulation.</p></blockquote>
<p>So which is it? Which market does the minimum coverage provision actually regulate?</p>
<p>The larger point, he says, is that</p>
<blockquote><p>the relevant “regulated activity”—or, phrased differently, the relevant regulated market—is quite open to debate [and that the] fact that the challenged provision only regulates a particular activity directly (… the decision whether to acquire health insurance in the case of the ACA) does not answer the question. The regulated activity or market, for purposes of evaluating whether the challenged provision is within Congress&#8217;s enumerated powers, may well be different than the conduct that the provision <i>directly</i> governs. Answering the critical question is not as simple as examining the empirical realities of the challenged provision by itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s spot-on.  But I think it would be profoundly disingenuous for any judge to say that the relevant market is simply the health insurance market.  The purpose and the effect of the ACA, including the mandate provision, clearly is to regulate the method by which healthcare is funded in this country.  </p>
<p>Joohdeph ends his post by saying that the distinction between regulation of the market for health insurance and regulation of the market for healthcare is “obviously of enormous importance.”  He writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>For if the relevant market is only that for health insurance, the minimum coverage requirement looks truly unprecedented (and constitutionally problematic). But if the relevant market is that for health care services, then what Congress is regulating is a market in which virtually every American <i>actively</i>participates&#8211;and the minimum coverage provision is merely regulating the <i>commercial terms</i> on which thatactive participation occurs. And this framing, of course, makes it seem well within Congress&#8217;s authority to regulate interstate commerce.</p></blockquote>
<p>He’s right, but only if, as he says earlier, the market for health insurance is defined so narrowly that health insurance is viewed as a commodity, a product, independent of the product’s purpose and effect.  And then, the constitutional issue would not, I think, be whether Congress has the authority under the Commerce Clause, aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, to regulate the health insurance market, but instead whether this violates some other constitutional limitation.  You know: the slippery-slope-to-government-compelled-consumption-of-broccoli argument.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Supreme Court is unlikely, in my opinion, to say that the relevant market is health insurance rather than healthcare.  That would pretty much require them to do what they did in <i>Bush v. Gore</i>: pronounce the ruling good for that case only.  Which is why I think the ACA will survive the constitutional challenge.  But if it doesn’t, it’s likely to be one a 5-4 slippery-slope-to-government-compelled-consumption-of-broccoli ruling. </p>
<p>&#8212;-  </p>
<p>The most important of the ACA-case appellate arguments is tomorrow afternoon in Atlanta, at the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals.  This is the appeal in the case in which 26 states and one private organization are the plaintiffs, and in which the trial-level judge, Roger Vinson, held the entire ACA unconstitutional because, he said, the mandate is too essential to the entire statute to strike that provision down without also striking down the entire ACA.  Paul Clement, who, it was announced today, will be representing Arizona in defending the constitutionality of the most draconian of Arizona’s recently enacted immigration-law statutes, and who is representing six Republican House members in defending the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act, is the states’ lead attorney.  (Looks like a pattern here, for Clement.)</p>

                                <p>A post of mine on May 17 titled <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">The Difference Between Defending DOMA and Defending Neo-Nazis and the ACA</a> discussed a post on the Blog of Legal Times that summarized part of a lengthy article published that day on Daily Report Online.  These websites and their respective hard-copy publications, Legal Times, based in New Jersey, and Daily Report, based in Atlanta, are part of American Law Media, which publishes The National Law Journal and several local law journals around the country.  The Daily Report Online article is titled “Inside K&#038;S&#8217;s DOMA debacle.”  </p>
<p>K&#038;S is Atlanta-based mega law firm King &#038; Spalding.  DOMA is the Defense of Marriage Act. King &#038; Spalding’s debacle is that … well … read my earlier post.</p>
<p>Or, better yet, read the full Daily Report Online article, by Daily Report reporter Meredith Hobbs.  The Blog of Legal Times article, which, as I said, summarized only part of the article—a small part, it turns out—provided an, um, password-protected link to the source article, useful for all you folks who subscribe to the Daily Report.

<p>Fulton County Daily Report</p>
<p>Wednesday, May 11, 2011<br />Inside K&#038;S&#8217;s DOMA debacle<br />Firm&#8217;s Washington chief says review process wasn&#8217;t followed due to an &#8216;unfortunate misunderstanding&#8217;<br />By Meredith Hobbs, Staff Reporter</p>
<p>Following a barrage of criticism over King &#038; Spalding&#8217;s withdrawal from defending the Defense of Marriage Act two weeks ago, the Washington office managing partner broke the firm&#8217;s official silence and made a statement to the Daily Report accepting responsibility for the &#8220;unfortunate misunderstanding&#8221; and &#8220;breakdown in communications&#8221; that led former partner Paul D. Clement to contract with the U.S. House of Representatives to defend the law.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Other than a short statement on April 25 by firm chairman Robert D. Hays Jr. calling the vetting process inadequate, the statement by J. Sedwick &#8220;Wick&#8221; Sollers gives the first insight that the firm has offered publicly into how it came to defend DOMA, only to withdraw from the case 11 days later. </p>
<p>Sollers&#8217; full statement read: &#8220;Although our chairman Robert Hays has issued a short statement saying he assumed ultimate responsibility for any mistakes that were made, I want to make sure the record is clear that I was the member of firm management in primary contact with Paul Clement regarding this matter. As I have reflected on this, despite the fact that our standard client/matter review process was not followed, it was reasonable for him to believe that the firm would accept the matter. This was an unfortunate misunderstanding with a friend whom I personally recruited to the firm and strongly supported. I am deeply disappointed by Paul&#8217;s departure and regret the breakdown in communications.&#8221; </p>
<p>Although the statement from Sollers indicated that Clement was given some form of encouragement to take the case, it maintained Hays&#8217; position that the vetting process was inadequate. Sollers&#8217; statement doesn&#8217;t conflict with a blistering public letter of resignation addressed to Hays that Clement released to the media on April 25.</p>
<p>Clement took the highly unusual step in his letter of publicly criticizing his former firm for &#8220;abandoning&#8221; a client because of public pressure, but he offered no details on what he viewed as the firm&#8217;s support for taking the case.</p>
<p>In that letter, Clement said, &#8220;I would have never undertaken this matter unless I believed I had the full backing of the firm. I recognized from the outset that this statute implicates very sensitive issues that prompt strong views on both sides.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to lawyers, the surest way to be on the wrong side of history is to abandon a client in the face of hostile criticism,&#8221; he wrote, adding that &#8220;efforts to delegitimize any representation for one side of a legal controversy are a profound threat to the rule of law.&#8221;</p>
<p>The gap between Hays&#8217; statement that the matter was inadequately vetted and Clement&#8217;s that he believed the firm was backing it stirred up a firestorm in the media. </p>
<p>Editorial writers castigated King &#038; Spalding for withdrawing from the controversial case, and the firm has faced vehement criticism outside the legal community, first from gay rights supporters and now from anti-gay rights groups.</p>
<p>The Daily Report&#8217;s conversations with two lawyers within the firm who spoke on condition that they not be named because King &#038; Spalding has prohibited its people from talking publicly about the controversy, as well as a third person familiar with the situation, said that the DOMA matter was not submitted to the firm&#8217;s business review committee. They say the firm is being criticized for dropping a case it never properly accepted.</p>
<p>Clement has not spoken publicly about the matter since releasing his resignation letter. He did not respond to several calls and emails from the Daily Report over the past week and after receiving Sollers&#8217; statement.</p>
<p>The firm&#8217;s only previous statement on the DOMA matter was that of Hays announcing the firm&#8217;s withdrawal from the engagement April 25, just a week after it became public that Clement had agreed to represent the U.S. House. &#8220;In reviewing this assignment further, I determined that the process used for vetting this engagement was inadequate,&#8221; Hays said, adding that he took responsibility for any mistakes.</p>
<p>King &#038; Spalding had not done any work on the case when it disengaged; there are no filings in Windsor v. U.S., one of the suits challenging the law, from when Clement filed the April 18 motion to intervene through April 25, when the chair of the firm&#8217;s business review committee, New York partner Richard A. Cirillo, filed a motion for King &#038; Spalding to withdraw.</p>
<p>Clement left King &#038; Spalding for a small Washington boutique, Bancroft, the same day to stay on the DOMA matter.</p>
<p>The sources who spoke to the Daily Report said that the DOMA matter was never vetted by the firm&#8217;s business review committee before Clement signed a contract obligating the firm. They said the committee, composed of five partners from different offices, immediately began reviewing the case Tuesday, April 19—the day after the firm learned of the contract—and rejected it the next day.</p>
<p>&#8220;The firm did not back out. We never agreed to take it,&#8221; said one of the King &#038; Spalding lawyers.</p>
<p>Clement signed the engagement contract to handle the DOMA matter on April 14, but his involvement did not become public until April 18, when he filed a motion to intervene in Windsor v. U.S. in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p>The judge in the case had given Congress until April 18 to intervene after the U.S. Department of Justice in late February announced it would not defend challenges to Section 3 of DOMA, defining marriage for federal purposes as a union between a man and a woman, because it violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution.</p>
<p>The sources said the firm&#8217;s partners were taken by surprise when the news broke that Clement had taken the DOMA engagement. By the next day, the sources said, some partners had learned that the case had not been submitted for vetting to the firm&#8217;s business review committee. All matters at King &#038; Spalding must be approved by this committee, they said, adding it was discovered that there was no matter file for the DOMA case in the firm&#8217;s system.</p>
<p>Only the business review committee can create a matter file, said the sources. Without one, an engagement effectively does not exist, since there is no way to bill hours to it. The sources said nobody at the firm has the authority to override the decisions of the business review committee.</p>
<p>King &#038; Spalding, like other large firms, is managed by practice groups, not offices. Partners submit a potential matter to the business review committee with approval from the practice group leader. A conflicts check must be performed and, if a case checks out, the business review committee facilitates further vetting, said one of the sources.</p>
<p>&#8220;Any matter that is controversial in any way or where there is a discounted rate goes through the business review committee,&#8221; said one of the sources, noting that the DOMA engagement was both controversial and had a discounted rate.</p>
<p>The contract that Clement signed with the House—which was made public by House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi—specified a blended rate of $520 per hour for Clement and two other partners, with a ceiling of $500,000 over a two-year period. Clement&#8217;s customary rate has been reported at $800 per hour. At least 12 suits have been filed challenging Section 3 of DOMA.</p>
<p>All of the King &#038; Spalding sources said that there was adamant opposition to the DOMA case from within the firm. One of the sources said there has never been such opposition by the firm&#8217;s partners to an engagement: &#8220;never in these numbers and vehemence to this magnitude.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It sticks a finger in the eye of people,&#8221; said one of the sources, referring to the firm&#8217;s gay lawyers and staff. An associate of the firm is president of Georgia&#8217;s gay legal group, the Stonewall Bar Association, while a King &#038; Spalding partner is on Stonewall&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>One source said the case also did not fit the firm&#8217;s business mission. &#8220;King &#038; Spalding is a corporate law firm—not a constitutional firm. This is not the kind of case the firm generally takes.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was also opposition to a clause in the contract gagging the firm&#8217;s people from any advocacy around DOMA, said the sources, who added that the clause was likely illegal in California, where the firm has two offices.</p>
<p>Democrats on the Committee on House Administration, which reviews outside counsel contracts, said the majority Republicans on their committee kept Clement&#8217;s contract secret from them. But a King &#038; Spalding source said the client&#8217;s possible concerns over confidentiality would not have prompted anyone at the firm to bypass the review committee.</p>
<p>&#8220;The idea that the business review committee cannot keep client confidentiality a secret is absurd,&#8221; the source said.</p>
<p>According to news reports, Clement&#8217;s new contract with the House is the same as his old one—for the same rate and fee and with the same ban on advocacy around DOMA by firm employees. But the muzzling clause now is for seven lawyers and staff at a Washington boutique where members share a conservative ideology, according to their website biographies, rather than for more than 800 lawyers, plus staff, with disparate political and social outlooks in 17 offices in the U.S., Europe, the Middle East and Asia.</p>

<p><strong>New wrinkles in the ACA litigation – Part II</strong> </p>
<p>Okay, well, now y’all know from reading <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/more-on-activityinactivity-canard-in.html">Part I</a> that under the Constitution’s Article III requirement that plaintiffs in lawsuits have some “particularized” (and ya know what that means, from reading Part I) injury or be in imminent danger of suffering one, and that the imminent danger can, theoretically, be hardship due to the anticipated violation of the plaintiffs’ rights. So you’ll be able to sail right through the federal-court-jurisdiction questions in the Civil Procedure section of the multi-state part of the bar exam.  </p>
<p>You’ll also be able to understand what happened last Friday in the ACA case scheduled for oral argument on Wednesday in the Sixth Circuit federal appellate court.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The case is <i>Thomas More Law Center, et al. v. Obama</i>.  Thomas More Law Center is a rightwing organization whose purpose is to challenge the constitutionality of laws or government policies or government actions against a particular individual that the far right finds offensive. Almost always, the underlying cause is a culture-wars issue, although sometimes the immediate issue being litigated is a more general procedural or constitutional-rights issue.  </p>
<p>For example, a few weeks ago, a friend asked me whether I would be willing to advise a Thomas More lawyer on a procedural issue concerning access to federal court for a couple who are my friend’s friends and who are entwined in a legal morass stemming from their protests at an abortion clinic, for which they were prosecuted.  My friend knows I know <i>loads</i> about the procedural issue, known as the <i>Rooker-Feldman</i>doctrine, an absurd Supreme Court-created bar to access to federal court in order to challenge the constitutionality of state-court actions.  I was happy to oblige, partly because this couple’s due process rights, <i>were</i>, in my opinion, violated, and partly because that doctrine <i>itself</i> violates the Fourteenth Amendment.  On March 7, in an opinion called <i>Skinner v. Switzer</i>, the Supreme Court finally killed the doctrine, or tried to; because <i>Skinner</i> does not expressly say, “We overrule <i>Dist. of Columbia Ct. of App. v. Feldman</i>,” the 1983 opinion that created the doctrine on the basis of the Court’s interpretation of a statute that was amended in 1986 to remove the part of that statute that the Court was interpreting, some of the lower federal courts are ignoring <i>Skinner</i>.  Just as I’d predicted on Mar. 7 when I read the opinion.  </p>
<p>But I digress.  </p>
<p>The <i>et al.</i> are four individuals who are members of the Thomas More organization. (It’s apparently an organization that has a membership, like the NAACP, the ACLU and the NRA, rather than just a law firm.)  The organization’s standing to sue is derivative of its members’ standing—the ones that do have standing, that is, and only the members who actually will be forced by the ACA to buy health insurance or pay the penalty even arguably have standing.  Turns out that the only one of the individual plaintiffs who, at least from the plaintiffs’ earlier filings, claimed that injury and provided specifics about it—that she did not have health insurance and that the $700 per month she said she would have to pay under the ACA would cause her significant financial hardship—actually bought health insurance through her employer last October, after the lower-court decision, for less than $400.  The plaintiffs revealed this in their response to the court’s briefing request, which they filed last Wednesday. </p>
<p>Two of the other four individuals are not even claiming a lack of health insurance and therefore any injury from the mandate.  The other one—his name is Steven Hyder—has claimed that the mandate “negatively impacts me now because I will have to reorganize my affairs and essentially change the way I live to meet the government’s demands,” but he provided no specifics. </p>
<p>Voila!  On Friday, the government filed a motion asking the court to dismiss the appeal because, the government said, no plaintiff has standing to litigate this because no plaintiff has shown that he or she would suffer an injury from the mandate.  Hyder&#8217;s claim, the government says, is a mere conclusory statement; without facts supporting the conclusion, it’s not enough to establish standing.  And the others clearly haven’t established standing. And, because the trial-level judge, who is based in the Eastern District of Michigan, ruled that the ACA is constitutional, the government wants the appellate court not to “vacate” (hold null and void) that judge’s ruling, an action that normally the appellate court would do in such a circumstance.  </p>
<p>The government’s request that the appellate court dismiss the appeal yet leave the trial judge’s ruling intact strikes me as pointless.  Yes, the plaintiff who voluntarily bought health insurance in October did have standing when the lawsuit was filed and when the trial judge issued his ruling last summer.  But trial-court rulings have no effect except in the case in which the ruling was issued.  They don’t even set the law in that court’s own judicial district.  That ruling, if it remains in effect although the appeal is dismissed, probably wouldn’t even effect the rights of these plaintiffs—most significantly, of course, the Thomas More Law Center—because they were denied the right to an appeal. </p>
<p>At the oral argument on Wednesday, or before that in a filed response to the government’s motion, the Thomas More lawyers will get specific about the basis for Hyder’s claim of financial hardship and about whether the other two individuals now have health insurance. If they all have health insurance, then, the mandate won’t cause them financial hardship or, irrespectively of finances, force them to do something they don’t want to do.  They don’t have standing.  </p>
<p>But, assuredly, some plaintiff in some other ACA case does.  Or will.</p>

<p><strong>New wrinkles in the ACA litigation – Part I</strong> </p>
<p>On May 23, the three-judge federal Fourth Circuit appellate panel that two weeks ago heard oral argument in the two cases in Virginia challenging the constitutionality of the ACA issued an order asking the parties to brief the question of whether a federal statute known as the Tax Anti-Injunction removes the federal courts’ “jurisdiction”—i.e., legal authority—to hear a case filed “for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax.”  The statute, subtitled “Prohibition of suits to restrain assessment or collection,” is part of the IRS Code.  </p>
<p>The relevant part of the statute reads: <br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Except as provided in sections 6015 (e), 6212 (a) and (c), 6213 (a),  6225 (b), 6246 (b),  6330 (e)(1), 6331 (i), 6672 (c), 6694 (c), and 7426 (a) and (b)(1),7429 (b), and 7436, no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person, whether or not such person is the person against whom such tax was assessed.</p></blockquote>
<p>The panel asked for briefing on three questions.  The first one has two parts.  It asks, generically, whether the statute, when applicable, divests the courts of jurisdiction to hear this type of case, and, if so, whether it does that in these cases.  The two parts, each of which references a particular earlier Supreme Court holding—one in a 1962 opinion called <i>J.L. Enochs v. Williams Packing &#038; Navigation Co.</i>, that created an exception to the statute when the statute otherwise would apply, the other a 1974 opinion called, Bob Jones University v. Simon, saying that in that particular case, the exception created in <i>Williams Packing</i> doesn’t apply—appears to me to be just a clumsy way of asking whether, if the penalty assessment is a “tax,” the ACA cases come within the exception created by <i>Williams Packing</i>.</p>
<p>Clearly, the statute indicates that when it is applicable, it divests the courts of jurisdiction to hear the case. </p>
<p>The second question asks whether “a challenged exaction”—here, the fee that must be paid through the IRS for failure to purchase health insurance—can qualify as a “tax” under the Anti-Injunction Act whether or not it qualifies as a tax for purposes of Congress’s taxing power under Article I of the Constitution, the part of the Constitution that lists most of Congress’s powers. </p>
<p>The third question asks whether, if the Anti-Injunction Act does apply to these lawsuits—that is, if the exaction is considered a tax for purposes of the Act—the plaintiffs (the State of Virginia, in one of the lawsuits; Liberty University and a few named individuals, in the other lawsuit) will have “the ability to challenge the exaction … in a refund suit or otherwise.”  <i>Williams Packing</i> held that the statute would violate the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause unless an exception to the statute’s applicability is created if there otherwise will never be an avenue in which the plaintiff can challenge the constitutionality of the tax and obtain redress if the tax is unconstitutional; that’s the exception that <i>Williams Packing</i> creates.  But the ability to sue to request a refund of the tax once the tax has been paid usually will suffice, according to <i>Williams Packing</i>, for due process purposes.   </p>
<p>The two ACA cases were decided at the trial-court level by different judges.  The judge in the case filed by Virginia ruled that the “mandate” part of the ACA is unconstitutional.  The judge in the Liberty U. case ruled the entire ACA constitutional.  </p>
<p>The Anti-Tax Injunction Act was never an issue in the Virginia case, because Virginia itself will not be subject to the penalty for failure to obtain health insurance.  In fact, for that reason, the three-judge panel will dismiss that lawsuit, saying that Virginia has no legal “standing”—no right—to challenge the statute’s constitutionality because the state will have no concrete injury from the statute.  That much was clear from the oral argument.  The Constitution’s Article III, which creates the federal judicial branch, gives the federal courts the power to hear only certain identified types of “cases” or “controversies.”  The Supreme Court has always interpreted the case or-controversy” language to mean that only parties that have sustained or are about to sustain a “particularized”—i.e., a concrete—injury, have “standing” to sue.  You can’t sue if your injury is only hypothetical. You have to have an “injury in fact.”</p>
<p>But at least some of the individuals in the Liberty U. case, if not the U. itself, apparently do have standing to challenge the mandate’s penalty fee.  And the Anti-Injunction Act became an issue in that case because the Justice Dept. had called the penalty fee a “tax.”  Rather than relying just on the power that the Constitution gives Congress to regulate commerce, and its authority under the Constitution to enact laws “necessary and proper” to execute its commerce-regulating power, the Justice Dept. claimed that Congress also had the authority under its taxing power to enact the ACA, including the mandate provision.  The Justice Dept. then invoked the Tax Anti-Injunction Act and claimed that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the part of the case that challenges the constitutionality of the mandate and the penalty “tax.”  But the trial-level judge rejected the characterization of the penalty fee as a tax, saying it’s more accurately characterized as a regulatory penalty.  Holding that he had the authority to consider the constitutionality of the ACA, he ruled the law constitutional.  </p>
<p>The Justice Dept. didn’t raise the Tax Anti-Injunction issue on appeal.  But the judges now have, and what’s clear from the May 23 order is that, at least at this point, they plan to characterize the mandate penalty as a tax for purposes of that statute.  That’s a curious view, since the purpose of the taxing power is to raise revenue and the purpose of the Anti-Injunction Act is to allow the revenue to be raised, unencumbered by court injunctions.  The purpose of the ACA’s mandate is to require almost everyone to have health insurance, and the point of the penalty is to require everyone to comply with that mandate.  Which is why the panel apparently has concluded, accurately, in my opinion, that the penalty is not a tax under Article I of the Constitution. And which is why, if that the Tax Injunction Act nonetheless applies to the penalty, the Supreme Court will reverse them.  And, on this issue, it should.  The penalty does raise revenue, but only incidentally, just as other government fines, including fines as criminal sentences, do.  But fines aren’t taxes.  </p>
<p>There’s also, at least in my opinion, a big question whether the Anti-Injunction Act applies even when what’s at issue is clearly a tax, if, as here, what the plaintiffs are asking for is just a declaration (called a declaratory judgment) that the statute is unconstitutional, rather than asking the court to enjoin collection of the tax. In Williams Packing and Bob Jones University, the plaintiffs were asking the court to enjoin the collection of the tax.  In the ACA cases, they’re asking the court to declare the statute, or at least the mandate provision, to which the penalty fee is only an enforcement tool, unconstitutional.  A purpose of the lawsuits is to restrain the assessment or collection of the fee, but they’re not asking the court to do that directly. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in an ACA case scheduled for oral argument on June 1 in the Sixth Circuit appellate court, the court that hears federal appeals from Michigan, Ohio, Kentucky and Tennessee, the three-judge panel asked the parties on May 12, the day after the argument in the Virginia case, to briefly brief three questions, two of which concern whether the controversy is “ripe” for resolution—that is, whether, given that the ACA mandate doesn’t begin until 2014, the plaintiffs have alleged an injury in fact, and, if not, whether they’ve alleged “an ‘imminent injury’ creating a case or actual controversy under Article Ill and the Declaratory Judgment Act” this long before the effective date of the mandate provision.   The panel also requested briefing on whether the IRS’s enforcement mechanisms impact whether there is a current or imminent injury because, the plaintiffs claim, they must plan long ahead for this extra expense.  </p>
<p>The panel also asked a question about the substance of the case: whether these plaintiffs are claiming that the statute is unconstitutional on its face—i.e., that it is unconstitutional <i>vis-à-vis</i> everyone—or whether instead they’re just claiming that the statute is unconstitutional as it would be applied to them and others like them but not to everyone. </p>
<p>The parties filed their brief briefs on Wednesday.  And from there, the plot thickens.</p>

                                <p>by <strong>Beverly Mann</strong></p>
<p>Last week, one of the law blogs I read regularly mentioned a post from May 11 on a law blog read regularly by a lot of law geeks (but not by me) about the oral argument in those cases a day earlier.  The blog is The Volokh Conspiracy.  Its bloggers are prominent rightwing or libertarian-right law profs, most of whom once were law clerks to a conservative Supreme Court justice.  This particular post was by Georgetown law prof. Randy Barnett, who is a veritable font of rightwing legal theory and suggestions for rightwing laws and legal arguments. </p>
<p>He also is, from what I can tell, the farthest right of that blog’s bloggers. Earlier this year, one of the big, big names on that blog, Orin Kerr, wrote that he was pretty darned certain that under the Supreme Court’s Commerce Clause and Necessary and Proper Clause rulings, the ACA was constitutional.  One of the other bloggers there—probably Barnett, but I don’t recall—disputed that. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Anyway, in his May 11 post, Barnett recounted an exchange between acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal, who was arguing the appeal on behalf of the government, and panel judge Diana Gribbon Motz, a Clinton appointee.   To refresh your memory from two weeks ago, all three of the panel members are Dem appointees, the other two of them appointed by Obama. Also to refresh your memory, the main challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA is that the Constitution’s Commerce Clause does not give Congress the authority to regulate inactivity.  To which the government has responded that the decision to not buy health insurance and to instead rely upon the largess of the government, hospitals and ultimately those who do pay health insurance premiums to get emergency medical treatment, is activity.  And that in any event, under the Supreme Court’s longtime Commerce Clause jurisprudence, that Clause coupled with the Necessary and Proper Clause gives Congress the power to regulate markets and that therefore there is no activity/inactivity distinction for Commerce Clause purposes.   </p>
<p>The Commerce Clause gives Congress the power, in the Constitution’s precise words, “To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes”.</p>
<p>In his post, Barnett pointed out something that was not in the other reports I’d read about the oral arguments: that in a lengthy exchange with Katyal, Motz indicated that she buys the activity/non-activity distinction, because she believes the definition of the word “regulate” means “regulate activity.”  She kept insisting that if the failure to buy health insurance is inactivity rather than activity, then, under her understanding of the definition of the word “regulate,” Congress couldn’t regulate it. </p>
<p>Katyal flubbed the response to this.  Partly.  He noted the Supreme Court’s most recent relevant Commerce Clause/Necessary and Proper Clause decision, Gonzales v. Raich, a 2005 opinion that held that the federal statute enacted under the Commerce Clause powers that criminalizes the growing and use of marijuana applies even to homegrown marijuana that is not sold even intrastate, much less in interstate commerce, and that is just for the personal use of the grower.  The rationale: that even those actions impact the interstate market for marijuana.  Since the Commerce Clause gives Congress the authority to regulate interstate markets, Congress can, under the Necessary and Proper Clause, regulate things that otherwise cannot be regulated under the Commerce power if those things impact the interstate market.  </p>
<p>Motz, though, missed the point. Growing marijuana is an activity, she pointed out, so how is Raich relevant to whether Congress can, under the Commerce Clause together with the Necessary and Proper Clause, regulate inactivity?  Well, um, maybe that what’s relevant isn’t the particular reason why the Commerce Clause alone isn’t enough and must be aided by the Necessary and Proper Clause, but instead that if something—whether activity only within a state’s boundary, or instead inactivity, or instead whatever—impacts a market that Congress has the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate, then Congress has the constitution authority to regulate it as necessary and proper under the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p>Katyal apparently was too dumbfounded to explain this.  According to a report I read, he was assigned to handle those oral arguments only a two or three days before the date of the arguments, and that might be one reason; the top person at the Solicitor General’s office normally personally only does that in the Supreme Court (and then, rarely).  </p>
<p>A day or two after those oral arguments, Obama’s nomination of  a man named Donald Verrilli to replace Elena Kagan as Solicitor General was voted out of committee. It’s scheduled for a full vote in the Senate on June 6. Here’s some of what the New York Times said about Verrilli’s background last January when Obama nominated him:<br />
<blockquote>Before joining the administration (in 2009), Mr. Verrilli spent two decades as a prominent litigator with the law firm of Jenner &#038; Block, where he was chairman of its Supreme Court practice group, while also teaching First Amendment law as an adjunct professor at Georgetown law school.</p>
<p>He participated in more than 100 Supreme Court cases and argued 12 of them. He has also argued about 35 times before federal appeals courts and state supreme courts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Verrilli won’t be arguing the Sixth Circuit ACA-case appeal there on June 1.  But presumably, he’ll be arguing the upcoming ACA appeals in the other federal appellate courts-including the two in the Eleventh Circuit, one of which is the most high-profile one nationally because the lower-court judge, Roger Vinson, pronounced the entire ACA unconstitutional, the other in which the lower-court judge ruled the entire statute constitutional. And he’ll eventually defend the statute’s constitutionality in the Supreme Court. Enough said.  I’m pretty sure of it.  </p>
<p>By which I mean that the case will be argued for the government as sharply and expertly as the cases will be argued for the other side by former Bush Solicitor General Paul Clement, who, now in private practice, was retained to represent the statute-challengers in the Roger Vinson case in the Eleventh Circuit. Unless, of course, Verrilli’s nomination is filibustered.</p>

<p><strong>Much Ado About Not Much</strong> </p>
<p>The big legal news today was the first appellate-court oral argument, this afternoon, on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act.  The argument—arguments, actually; two separate cases were argued separately—were to a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the regional federal appeals court for several mid-Atlantic and southern states, including Virginia.  </p>
<p>In one of the two cases argued today, Virginia’s Tea Party attorney general, Ken Cuccinelli, had sued on behalf of the state, challenging the constitutionality of the ACA in total and, jointly and severally, the individual-mandate provision providing for a civil fine for failure to obtain health insurance.  (OK, the use of the phrase “jointly and severally” is an inside joke among lawyer types; joint and several liability is a personal-injury-law term that means that each defendant found guilty of participating in causing the injury is liable individually for the whole amount of the monetary award if the other defendants can’t pay their fair share.)   The lower-court judge held that individual-mandate provision, but not the rest of the statute, unconstitutional, so the state appealed.  In the other case argued today, Liberty University and a few individuals challenged the law as unconstitutional on several grounds, including that, according to the university, the law would allow for federal funding of abortions. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In the State of Virginia case, a threshold issue is whether the state has legal “standing” to challenge the constitutionality of the statute, ostensibly on behalf of its residents, since the statute doesn’t affect the rights of the state itself.  In the Liberty U. case, the federal-funding-of-abortions grounds for constitutional challenge is a non-starter, but at least the U. has standing to sue, since it’s an employer and parts of the ACA do affect employers, and the individuals who are suing along with the U. have standing because they’re, well, individuals and therefore subject to the individual-mandate provision.. </p>
<p>Anyway … all three panel members, selected randomly from among the members of that court, are Dem appointees, one a Clinton appointee, the other two Obama appointees.  The reports about the arguments can be summed up as: the panel will find that Virginia has not standing to sue to challenge the constitutionality of the law, and that the entire law, including the individual-mandate provision, is constitutional as “necessary and proper” (a term in the Constitution) legislation under Congress’s power to regulate commerce, a power specified in the Constitution.  </p>
<p>One of the Obama appointees, Andre Davis, said that under the Commerce clause, Congress has broad power to regulate national markets—something that the Court has held unremittingly since the 1930s—including the health insurance market.  The other two judges, Clinton appointee Diana Gribbon Motz and Obama appointee James A. Wynn, Jr., pointed out that regulating commerce includes regulating the effects of people’s decisions, individually or collectively, on commerce—on markets—and so, for Commerce clause purposes, if not independently, then at least via the necessary-and-proper clause, there is no distinction between the power to regulate “activity” and the power to regulate “inactivity.”  This undercuts the crux of the challengers’ claim, which is that there is a constitutionally significant distinction between regulation of “activity” and regulation of “inactivity.”  The judges kept pressing the Liberty U. lawyer to delineate a line between activity and inactivity, and to state whether a decision not to do something amounts to an action.  </p>
<p>Apparently, he failed the activity test, at least as far as this panel is concerned.  </p>
<p>Within the next few weeks, there will be three other appellate arguments, in other regional appeals courts, on the constitutionality of the ACA.  </p>
<p>And all of these, and the opinions these panels will write, are sideshows.  Normally, the persuasive strength of an appellate opinion in a case that clearly will be decided ultimately by the Supreme Court could matter, by persuading a justice or two or, in a high-profile case, by persuading the public and therefore, indirectly, a justice of two.</p>
<p>But these cases—this issue—has the feel of Bush v. Gore, at least in that each of the justices almost certainly already knows how he or she will vote.  I’ve said here earlier, and I’ll repeat it, that I think the swing vote in this case is Scalia, not Kennedy, and that because Scalia has boxed himself in, in earlier, relatively recent opinions, on the basic commerce-clause/necessary-and-proper clause questions at issue in the ACA litigation, he will vote to uphold the statute as constitutional. </p>
<p>I’ve also said, though, that I’m probably wrong.</p>

<p><strong>The Fine Print</strong> </p>
<p>It’s hardly a secret that Chamber of Commerce types have co-opted a bare majority of the Supreme Court as their proxy in their war against business litigation, and that the most potent categorical weapons are arbitration as a forced substitute for lawsuits and the effective elimination of class actions.  </p>
<p>In a manipulative, far-reaching opinion that the Court issued Monday, the five corporate proxies killed both birds with one stone.  </p>
<p>The stone was thrown in a lawsuit by a California AT&#038;T cell-phone service customer who signed a service contract with the company and received what the company said was a free phone but for which the customer later was billed $30 in sales tax—the sales tax on the regular retail price of the phone.  </p>
<p>The contract, like virtually all consumer contracts and many other types of non-negotiable standard contracts between a business and a customer or client, or between an employer and employee, includes an arbitration provision.  The provision waives the right to sue, and provides that any disputes be resolved instead in arbitration, a setup in which the business pays the arbitrator and, as a wink-and-nod practical matter, will use that arbitrator again in other arbitrations, or not, depending on, well … you know.  The blindfolded lady holding the evenly-balanced scales of justice isn’t around.</p>
<p>Update: (Dan here&#8230;. From Scotusblog <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/att-mobility-v-concepcion?wpmp_switcher=desktop">AT&#038;T Mobility v. Concepcion (No. 09-893)</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/09-893.pdf">the Court&#8217;s opinion is here</a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The arbitration provision in AT&#038;T’s form contract, like the form contracts of many other large corporations or firms, doesn’t just require a waiver of the right to sue.  It also bars class arbitrations.  It requires, in other words, that each customer who claims to have been defrauded out of a small amount of money proceed through arbitration independently of every other victim of the alleged scam—and, as a practical matter, because the amount is so small, without an attorney. </p>
<p>The Federal Arbitration Act of 1925 requires courts to honor arbitration clauses—that is, to dismiss lawsuits when the business defendant asks the court to do that on the basis of the arbitration clause.  But the FAA includes a provision that allows courts to invalidate the arbitration clause under “generally applicable contract defenses.”  Such as that the contract was signed under duress, or that one of its provisions is unconscionable as a matter of public policy (usually because one party had no bargaining power and could play no role in deciding the terms of the contract, and the provision is unfair to that party).  Normally, contract law, including these defenses to enforcement of contracts, is a matter of state law, not federal law.  So usually it is state law that determines the circumstances under which a court can invalidate an arbitration clause and allow the customer, the securities-firm client, the employee, to sue in a real court.</p>
<p>Or was. </p>
<p>At the center of the Supreme Court case was a 2005 California Supreme Court opinion that interpreted two state statutes.  The California court construed those statutes as providing that if three conditions are met, the unconscionability defense can be used to void the part of an arbitration provision that waives the right to arbitrate as a class in California.  </p>
<p>The three conditions are that the agreement be a standard-form contract without negotiation (known as a contract of adhesion), that the disputes probably will involve small amounts of money, and that the party who wants the contract provision voided is alleging a scheme to defraud.  In its opinion Monday, Scalia, writing for the majority, said this conflicts with the purpose of the FAA, which—he said—was to encourage arbitration agreements and to ensure a quick, easy process.  Breyer, though, writing for the four dissenters, pointed out that Congress’s actual stated purpose was to require courts to treat arbitration agreements as contracts, for the purposes of enforcing them and, when required under contract law, voiding them—and that that is what the text of the FAA says. </p>
<p>Scalia also said that class arbitration defeats the purpose of arbitration.  Which I suppose is true if the purpose of arbitration, or at least arbitration as the only option under law, is to undermine any real threat of meaningful penalty for corporate wrongdoing.  </p>
<p>But Scalia claims a different for purpose for arbitration: to provide a simplified, quick process.  He complains that class arbitration complicates the process.  Which, as Breyer notes, it does, but says, “So what?” The purpose of arbitration is to provide a quicker, simpler process than full litigation.  Which class arbitration does, since it replaces not individual litigation but class litigation.  </p>
<p>Breyer doesn’t take the next step, though.  But someone should, soon.  The Court’s majority interprets the FAA as allowing contracts of adhesion to remove the right to litigate as a class although class litigation otherwise would be appropriate.  And the majority interprets the FAA as allowing those contracts to remove the right to arbitrate as a class when class litigation would be appropriate.  This seems, I think, to raise questions about the constitutionality of this statute, now that the Court has said the purpose of it was not simply to require courts to treat arbitration provisions as contracts under normal contract law but rather to allow a party to a contract of adhesion to strip courts of their authority to void those provisions, contract law notwithstanding.  </p>
<p>If Congress’s purpose was not to allow parties of relatively equal bargaining power to negotiate a contract that provided for arbitration, but was instead to remove access to the court system, independent of contractual rights—and if that is now the statute’s effect—it would seem that the statute itself violates basic constitutional precepts of due process of law. The Court’s majority’s new conflation of arbitration law and class action law, and their imposition of their own surprisingly-undisguised policy preferences as law, appears designed to do exactly that. </p>
