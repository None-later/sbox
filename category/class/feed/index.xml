<p>The Community Living Assistance Services and Supports, aka CLASS, was to be an integral part of PPACA (Obamacare), providing a funding source for some part of long-term care costs.</p>
<p>When DHHS Secretary Sebelius declared she would have to fix the program because the poor design was not financially viable, the vultures started to circle. Now it appears the Obama administration is likely to abandon the program, due to the poor design.</p>
<p>Liberals will not believe me, but complexity is the enemy of successful implementation, and PPACA is too complicated to work. </p>
<p>Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt </p>
<p>(I don&#8217;t agree with Rusty&#8217;s notion that &#8216;liberals&#8217; won&#8217;t agree&#8230;comments after the jump)</p>
