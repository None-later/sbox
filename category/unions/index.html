Reposted.
<p>After claiming repeatedly in the media that the fight to end public worker bargaining rights was all about the budget, Governor Walker stripped the collective bargaining provisions out of the budget (which required the participation of at least one Democrat to have a big enough quorum to satisfy Constitutional requirements for fiscal votes) and the Wisconsin legislature passed it separately. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Details from <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2011/03/09/anti-public-employee-bill-passes-senate-in-wisconsin-only-the-beginning-of-the-fight/">David Dayen</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you’ve been following along in my last post, you know the news: the Wisconsin State Senate rushed through and passed a bill that strips collective bargaining rights from most public employees. The vote in the State Senate, entirely composed of Republicans, was 18-1; only moderate Dale Schultz voted no. The budget repair bill was split at the last minute, cleaving the “non-fiscal” anti-union piece from the fiscal components of the bill. The non-fiscal piece did not require a quorum, so the Senate was able to pass it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This may not pass muster constitutionally in Wisconsin. Here is the germane language:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vote on fiscal bills; quorum. SECTION 8. On the passage in either house of the legislature of any law which imposes, continues or renews a tax, or creates a debt or charge, or makes, continues or renews an appropriation of public or trust money, or releases, discharges or commutes a claim or demand of the state, the question shall be taken by yeas and nays, which shall be duly entered on the journal; and three−fifths of all the members elected to such house shall in all such cases be required to constitute a quorum therein</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The language may seem ambiguous (claim of rather than claim on?). But there is likely to be precedent, and if not, the Court would look to the debates at the time the constitution was passed, to resolve the question of intent. It is very likely that the concerns expressed then would extend to both sides of the fiscal equation, that is, tax collection and disbursements, which would thus include obligations like employee contracts. </p>
<p>And Walker said repeatedly that the collective bargaining matter was fiscal. In modern contracts, you often have language in the agreement to exclude the headings from any interpretation. The Constitution would not have such language. So the “fiscal” in the heading would be included in any effort to parse the meaning. </p>
<p>But since the Supreme Court has a Republican majority, that would seem to cast a pall over challenges. But Supreme Court elections are on April 5, and the unions have a lot of support in the state. This bill passage (getting it through the Assembly is guaranteed) is subject to legal challenges not only on Constitutional but also on the basis of violating legislative procedures. And there is <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/MikeElk/status/45644514425176064">talk of a general strike</a>, something which if you had asked me two months ago, I would have deemed to be pretty much impossible in America. They may be permissible if spontaneous, as in bottom up rather than called by union leadership. </p>
<p>Some details of the official version from<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/03/09/AR2011030900299.html?wpisrc=nl_natlalert"> the Washington Post</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Republicans in the Wisconsin Senate voted Wednesday night to strip nearly all collective bargaining rights from public workers after discovering a way to bypass the chamber’s missing Democrats….</p>
<p>The Senate requires a quorum to take up any measures that spend money. But Republicans on Wednesday split from the legislation the proposal to curtail union rights, which spends no money, and a special conference committee of state lawmakers approved the bill a short time later.</p>
<p>The lone Democrat present on the conference committee, Rep. Tony Barca, shouted that the surprise meeting was a violation of the state’s open meetings law but Republicans voted over his objections. The Senate then convened within minutes and passed it without discussion or debate.</p>
<p>Spectators in the gallery screamed “You are cowards.”</p>
<p>Before the sudden votes, Democratic Sens. Bob Jauch said if Republicans “chose to ram this bill through in this fashion, it will be to their political peril. They’re changing the rules. They will inflame a very frustrated public.”</p>

<blockquote>In a Labor Day address in 1980, Ronald Reagan said:</p>
<p>&#8220;These are the values inspiring those brave workers in Poland … They remind us that where free unions and collective bargaining are forbidden, freedom is lost.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>In a January 2009 ABC interview with George Stephanopoulos, then President-elect Barack Obama said fixing the economy required shared sacrifice, &#8220;Everybody’s going to have to give. Everybody’s going to have to have some skin in the game.&#8221; (1)   <br />For the past two years, American workers submitted to the President’s appeal—taking steep pay cuts despite hectic productivity growth. By contrast, corporate executives have extracted record profits by sabotaging the recovery on every front—eliminating employees, repressing wages, withholding investment, and shirking federal taxes. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The global recession increased unemployment in every country, but the American experience is unparalleled. According to a July OECD report, the U.S. accounted for half of all job losses among the 31 richest countries from 2007 to mid-2010. (2) The rise of U.S. unemployment greatly exceeded the fall in economic output. Aside from Canada, U.S. GDP actually declined less than any other rich country, from mid-2008 to mid 2010. (3)</p>
<p>Washington’s embrace of labor market flexibility ensured companies encountered little resistance when they launched their brutal recovery plans. Leading into the recession, the US had the weakest worker protections against individual and collective dismissals in the world, according to a 2008 OECD study. (4) Blackrock’s Robert Doll explains, “When the markets faltered in 2008 and revenue growth stalled, U.S. companies moved decisively to cut costs—unlike their European and Japanese counterparts.” (5) The U.S. now has the highest unemployment rate among the ten major developed countries. (6).</p>
<p>The private sector has not only been the chief source of massive dislocation in the labor market, but it is also a beneficiary. Over the past two years, productivity has soared while unit labor costs have plummeted. By imposing layoffs and wage concessions, U.S. companies are supplying their own demand for a tractable labor market. Private sector union membership is the lowest on record. (7) Deutsche Bank Chief Economist Joseph LaVorgna notes that profits-per-employee are the highest on record, adding, “I think what investors are missing &#8211; and even the Federal Reserve &#8211; is the phenomenal health of the corporate sector.” (8)</p>
<p>Due to falling tax revenues, state and local government layoffs are accelerating. By contrast, U.S. companies increased their headcount in November at the fastest pace in three years, marking the tenth consecutive month of private sector job creation. The headline numbers conceal a dismal reality; after a lost decade of employment growth, the private sector cannot keep pace with new entrants into the workforce. </p>
<p>The few new jobs are unlikely to satisfy Americans who lost careers. In November, temporary labor represented an astonishing 80% of private sector job growth. Companies are transforming temporary labor into a permanent feature of the American workforce. UPI reports, “This year, 26.2 percent of new private sector jobs are temporary, compared to 10.9 percent in the recovery after the 1990s recession and 7.1 percent in previous recoveries.” (9) The remainder of 2010 private sector job growth has consisted mainly of low-wage, scant-benefit service sector jobs, especially bars and restaurants, which added 143,000 jobs, growing at four times the rate of the rest of the economy. (10) </p>
<p>Aside from job fairs, large corporations have been conspicuously absent from the tepid jobs recovery. But they are leading the profit recovery. Part of the reason is the expansion of overseas sales, but the profit recovery is primarily coming off the backs of American workers. After decades of globalization, U.S. multinationals still employ two-thirds of their global workforce from the U.S. (21.1 million out of 31.2 million). (11) Corporate executives are hammering American workers precisely because they are so dependent on them. </p>
<p>An annual study by USA Today found that private sector paychecks as a share of Americans’ total income fell to 41.9 percent earlier this year, a record low. (12) Conservative analysts seized on the report as proof of President Obama’s agenda to redistribute wealth from, in their words, those ‘pulling the cart’ to those ‘simply riding in it’. Their accusation withstands the evidence—only it’s corporate executives and wealthy investors enjoying the free ride. Corporate executives have found a simple formula: the less they contribute to the economy, the more they keep for themselves and shareholders. The Fed’s Flow of Funds reveals corporate profits represented a near record 11.2% of national income in the second quarter. (13)   <br />Non-financial companies have amassed nearly two-trillion in cash, representing 11% of total assets, a sixty year high. Companies have not deployed the cash on hiring as weak demand and excess capacity plague most industries. Companies have found better use for the cash, as Robert Doll explains, “high cash levels are already generating dividend increases, share buybacks, capital investments and M&#038;A activity—all extremely shareholder friendly.” (5) </p>
<p>Companies invested roughly $262 billion in equipment and software investment in the third quarter. (14) That compares with nearly $80 billion in share buybacks. (15) The paradox of substantial liquid assets accompanying a shortfall in investment validates Keynes’ idea that slumps are caused by excess savings. Three decades of lopsided expansions has hampered demand by clotting the circulation of national income in corporate balance sheets. An article in the July issue of The Economist observes: “business investment is as low as it has ever been as a share of GDP.” (16)</p>
<p>The decades-long shift in the tax burden from corporations to working Americans has accelerated under President Obama. For the past two years, executives have reported record profits to their shareholders partially because they are paying a pittance in federal taxes. Corporate taxes as a percentage of GDP in 2009 and 2010 are the lowest on record, just above 1%. (17)</p>
<p>Corporate executives complain that the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, but there’s a considerable difference between the statutory 35% rate and what companies actually pay (the effective rate). Here again, large corporations lead the charge in tax arbitrage. U.S. tax law allows multinationals to indefinitely defer their tax obligations on foreign earned profits until they ‘repatriate’ (send back) the profits to the U.S. U.S. corporations have increased their overseas stash by 70% in four years, now over $1 trillion—largely by dodging U.S taxes through a practice known as “transfer pricing”. (18)Transfer pricing allows companies to allocate costs in countries with high tax rates and book profits in low-tax jurisdictions and tax havens—regardless of the origin of sale. U.S. companies are using transfer pricing to avoid U.S. tax obligations to the tune of $60 billion dollars annually, according to a study by Kimberly A. Clausing, an economics professor at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. (18)</p>
<p>The corporate cash glut has become a point of recurrent contention between the Obama administration and corporate executives. In mid December, a group of 20 corporate executives met with the Obama administration and pleaded for a tax holiday on the $1 trillion stashed overseas, claiming the money will spur jobs and investment. In 2004, corporate executives convinced President Bush and Congress to include a similar amnesty provision in the American Jobs Creation Act; 842 companies participated in the program, repatriating $312 billion back to the U.S. at 5.25% rather than 35%. (19) In 2009, the Congressional Research Service concluded that most of the money went to stock buybacks and dividends—in direct violation of the Act. (20)</p>
<p>The Obama administration and corporate executives saved American capitalism. The U.S. economy may never recover. </p>

<div>Now that the story is getting out that Governor Walke et al&#8217;s bill is about more than just busting unions, a little bell went off in the back of my head. Yes, I read Shock Doctrine. Yes, I understand the true concept of fascism. I read What would Jefferson do. I read C &#038; L, AB, Hullabaloo, Glen Greenwald, watch Rachel, Ed, Cspan, etc, etc, etc. And, there are some people pointing out the connections between some of all these perspectives. However, Wisconsin&#8217;s current event just seemed too familiar. Deja vue familiar. More familiar than all the reading and listening would allow. It is experiencingly familiar and I don&#8217;t mean Egypt. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I mean, we can all see (or at least a majority are now seeing) the thread of connection to all the seemingly disjointed liberal/progressive commentary about what has been happening in America since around 1981. We even are accepting that Clinton et al&#8217;s governing time was part of the thread. It&#8217;s economic. It&#8217;s societal structure, it&#8217;s civil rights, it&#8217;s power (always is since the constitutional convention). </div>
<div></div>
<div>But, where&#8217;s the beef. Show me the money. Where is the materialization most recently that it all came together as to the implementation of the play book that Governor Walker et al are using such that I know this is real&#8230;this is really and honestly currently America&#8230;American?</div>

<blockquote><div>The political deadlock in Baghdad, which has prevented the formation of an Iraqi government more than six months after the parliamentary elections in March, has not prevented the administration of Nuri Kamal al-Maliki from opening the southern oilfields to the world&#8217;s giant corporations. <strong>Nor has it stopped the US Embassy and Commerce Department from reinvigorating the Bush-era program of selling the country&#8217;s public assets to corporate buyers.</strong> And because Iraqi unions have organized opposition to privatization since the start of the occupation, the Maliki administration is enforcing with a vengeance Saddam Hussein&#8217;s prohibition of public sector unions. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The United States may have withdrawn its combat brigades, but it is not leaving Iraq. And while Washington may have scaled back its dreams of nation-building, it has not given <strong>up on a key aspect of the economic agenda behind that project: encouraging corporate investment by sacrificing the rights of Iraqi workers.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>June demonstrations over blackouts, supported by the union &#8212; <strong>the first national union led by a woman, Hashmeya Muhsin &#8212; were put down by police,</strong> who killed one protester and injured several others</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also in June, longshoremen protesting the prohibition of unions in ports south of Basra <strong>were surrounded by troops, and the union&#8217;s leaders were transferred hundreds of miles from their homes. </strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>In January <strong>the government threw the president of Basra&#8217;s Iraqi Teachers Union in jail.</strong> According to Nasser al-Hussain, an executive board member, the government seeks to establish control over an organization it views as far too independent.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After the 2003 invasion, occupation czar Paul Bremer decided to keep on the books Saddam&#8217;s Law 150, which bans public sector unions. Each succeeding Iraqi administration continued the prohibition. </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Wisconsin is not Egypt nor the rest of the protesting that is going on in the middle east other than that there is protesting. Not at all. Wisconsin is Iraq for one big, monstrous, sledge hammer to the head reason: Iraq&#8217;s oppression and thus resistance by the unions is all American. The union busting to the benefit of capital (big, huge money for the rest of you, as in Rockefeller&#8217;s Standard Oil time) in Iraq is purely American. We own it. Yes, we have propped up dictators such as in Egypt. What is singularly different in the protesting of Egypt/Mid East is freedom. They protested for freedom. Now we&#8217;ll see if they get unions. However, Wisconsin and Iraq are free. American style free in that Iraq is American made. <a href="http://upsidedownworld.org/iraqiunions.htm">They also have/had unions</a>. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>At the end of World War I, Iraqi workers wasted no time in forming oil, railway and dockworker unions in the fragmented country that Churchill had carved out of the desert, connecting the oil fields of three Ottoman provinces–Mosul, Baghdad, and Basra. Their hold on the terrain already tenuous, the British occupiers responded with force. Repeated strikes were quashed, often violently. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Under Qasim&#8217;s watch, unions along with civic groups swelled in rank and number. By 1959, 250,000 workers had joined unions in Iraq; peasants had formed 3,000 village associations for 200,000 peasants; the Iraqi Women&#8217;s League boasted 20,000 members and the Democratic Youth Federation 84,000 youngsters. </div>
<div>Qasim&#8217;s &#8220;progressive&#8221; autocracy was fleeting, however, and in February of 1963, <strong>the Baath party, in alliance with a sect of the nationalist armed forces, and with the help of the CIA, overthrew Qasim.</strong></div>
<div></div>
<div>When Saddam Hussein seized control in 1979, he built upon the Baathist tradition of usurping the unions as an instrument of state power. As part of his brutal purge of all leaders and activists refusing to pledge total allegiance to the Baath party, he eradicated all non-Baathist unions. In 1987, the Baathist unions fully backed Saddam&#8217;s Orwellian decree: &#8220;From now on, the title &#8216;worker&#8217; is abolished and all workers shall become official employees by the State&#8230;<strong>As everybody is now a government employee, there is no more need for trade unions.&#8221;</strong> Interestingly, Saddam did tolerate private sector unions, albeit with certain laws circumscribing their powers. The exception appears irrelevant, because, since the 1970&#8217;s through the fall of Saddam, no strikes are known to have occurred in Iraq, according to Political Risk Services, a well-respected corporate consultancy firm.</div>

<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>If you think Obama&#8217;s recent commentary is hopeful for unions, <a href="http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=41829">guess again</a>:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>When questioned by reporters about the union bans, an official at the US Embassy, the world&#8217;s largest, said mildly, &#8220;We&#8217;re looking into it. We hope that everybody resolves their differences in an amicable way.&#8221; The Obama White House has not spoken out, and the latest <strong>State Department report on human rights plays down the oppression of Iraqi unionists, calling their situation a &#8220;limited exercise of labour rights.&#8221;</strong></div>

<p>Business Insider offers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-real-problem-with-labor-unions-2010-9#ixzz0ylUHWb1H">one sort of opinion</a> by Mike Shedlock&#8230; what I can gather from the short article are the implications that outsourcing over the globe is a consequence of unions, that we should be more like Louisiana, and there is no economic literature on labor to offer some alternative explanations.  And serves notice to public employee unions of what is next&#8230;you privileged workers are next after we finish off what is left of the private unions.  Really nice offering.</p>
<p>Now this particular effort might reflect some lack of understanding on the unions part, but absolves any decision by Cessna management for stupid decisions it appears. Be afraid is the message. </p>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s  the deal. The Hises and the union in general appear ready willing and  able to &#8220;hurt the whole Wichita economy&#8221; if they do not get what they  want.</p>
<p>I have to ask &#8220;How stupid is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer is &#8220;tremendously stupid&#8221;.</p>
<p>It  is far better to have a good paying job and no job security than no job  at all and no prospects of a job. That&#8217;s what it boils down to, and  like it or not, that is the economic reality.</p>
<p>I do not know what  salaries are, but a 10 year contract with only a 4.2% pay cut does not  strike me as a bad deal. Those who think otherwise need to compare it to  the alternative: seeing all the jobs go to Louisiana, Mississippi, or  outside the country.</p>
<p>By the way, wouldn&#8217;t residents of Louisiana  and Mississippi be very grateful for those job, regardless of what the  salary was? I think so. So the bottom line is this mess, is the unions  would be to blame and only the unions to blame if Cessna moves  elsewhere. The union will also be <a itxtdid="24403337" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-real-problem-with-labor-unions-2010-9#" classname="iAs">responsible</a> for wrecking the entire local economy if it happens.</p>
<p>Take  the contract and run! It&#8217;s for 10 years! Because &#8230;. You Don&#8217;t Know  What You&#8217;ve Lost Till Its Gone, Then It&#8217;s Too Late. In this case, it  will be gone forever.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Even more than Digby on CalPERS, the one piece everyone should read today is <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/02/international-travel-redux.html">Charlie Stross on International Travel</a>.  Since this is an economics blog, let&#8217;s pull a key section:<br />
<blockquote>Here&#8217;s the rub: security is a state of mind, not a procedure. Procedures can&#8217;t cope with attackers, because they&#8217;re inflexible. If you search passengers for guns, someone will carry a knife. If you search for knives, someone will sew themselves a set of underwear full of PETN. And so on. To deal with a threat — say, someone who wants to attack your air travel infrastructure — you must look for the attacker, not their tools, because they can change their tools at will to exploit weaknesses in your procedure for identifying tools.</p>
<p>JFK is wide open to terrorists intent on causing mass casualties&#8230;.</p>
<p>Schiphol — Amsterdam airport — gets the security screening right, or at least less wrong than JFK and most other airports. Rather than having a hideous bottleneck between check-in and the departure area, security screening is carried out at each depature gate, with a separate metal detector and X-ray belt; no huge crowds form in unsecured areas. On US-bound flights, someone who clearly isn&#8217;t a minimum-wage drone checks ID documents and asks a couple of questions that seem to me to the aimed at flushing out anyone who is disturbed or tense — a crude form of profiling.[italics his; boldfacing mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint preferred to <a href="http://whitehouse.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/01/20/fmr-tsa-nominee-disputes-senators-claim-over-unionization/">let the TSA remain leaderless for the past year</a> in fear of unionization of the workers.  As he explained to CNN:<br />

</p>
<p>Or, as quoted by Mark &#8220;neither Ernest nor earnest&#8221; Hemingway the Washington Examiner, in a piece oh-so-sensibly entitled <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/Napolitano-wants-to-unionize-TSA-employees-despite-safety-concerns-80206432.html">Napolitano wants to unionize TSA employees despite safety concerns</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The administration is intent in on unionizing and submitting our airport security to union bosses [and] collective bargaining, and this is at a time, as Senator Lieberman says, we&#8217;ve got to use our imagination we&#8217;ve got to be constantly flexible. We have to out think the terrorists. When we formed the airport security system we realize we could not use collective bargaining and unionization because of that need to be flexible. Yet that appears to be the top priority of the administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>But DeMint was much clearer on the Senate floor, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBs1OEEakNU&#038;feature=channel">speaking to Fox</a>:<br />
<blockquote>It makes absolutely no sense to submit the security of our airports and the passengers here in this country to collective bargaining with unions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which, of course, is why police and fire departments are all non-union as well.</p>
<p>The people you attract to any job—by your deliberate practices, not &#8220;unintended consequence&#8221;—are those who cannot get a job that they know to be more stable, pays better, has better benefits, or provide a more friendly work atmosphere.  By your policies and procedures, you reveal the type of worker you prefer.  This is as true of the TSA as it is of Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>In the case of the TSA, though, the combination produces the natural hire as the people who couldn&#8217;t get a job at Applebee&#8217;s, The Olive Garden, or Ruby Tuesday&#8217;s.</p>
<p>As Paul Kedrosky recently noted, it&#8217;s more &#8220;<a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2010/02/adventures_in_a_1.html">security theater</a>&#8221; than security.  So when DeMint compares the TSA to the FBI, he&#8217;s neglecting that <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel02/hire012302.htm">the average staring salary at the FBI <em>eight years ago</em> was over $43,000—with an increase of at least $10,000 upon completion of training</a>.  This is $20,000-$30,000 a year more than the $12/hour my neighbor made when he started with the TSA. (He quit quickly, finding restaurant work more profitable.)</p>
<p>If you want security, you pay for people who know how to do security.  If you want theater, you depend on Jim DeMint to ensure that the TSA remains leaderless, and then have no right to be surprised when a British novelist points out that your security isn&#8217;t secure.  Even when he says:<br />
<blockquote>Suppose I wanted to attack the US air travel infrastructure&#8230;.I can kill lots of passengers! All I need to do is to buy a maximum-size carry on bag (US dimensions: 7&#8243; x 13&#8243; x 20&#8243;) and build the biggest, heaviest bomb into it that I can wheel behind me&#8230;.</p>
<p>All I would have to do then is buy a ticket&#8230;and go queue. Then, when I get to the middle of the crowd, detonate the device. (For added horrors: have an accomplice with a similar device hang back, to detonate their bomb amidst the fleeing survivors.)</p>
<p>[S]ecurity checkpoints are a target, too, because they slow down travellers and cause crowds to form, and another term for &#8220;crowd&#8221; is &#8220;convenient target&#8221;. And because the attacker has not been separated from their weapon at the point when they reach such a target, it&#8217;s the logical weak point for causing maximum damage.</p></blockquote>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.sacbee.com/737/story/2086698.html">The Sacremento Bee</a> has forwarded this story (h/t reader Denis)</p>
<blockquote><p>The unionized government work force has roughly 200,000 or so employees represented by 12 labor organizations. It&#8217;s a vast, diverse group ranging from custodians to doctors, clerks to engineers. And don&#8217;t forget non-union managers.</p>
<p>All get different contract deals with varying terms. In a given year, one group might get, say, a 5 percent bump while another gets nothing.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s look at one big group, Service Employees Local 1000, which represents 95,000 state employees.</p>
<p>Last year it took $1.60 to buy what it cost a dollar to purchase in 1991, according to the CPI. Meanwhile, Local 1000 employees&#8217; cumulative salary increases over the same period added about 30 cents to that 1991 dollar.</p>
<p>To be fair, Local 1000 members who are in highly demanded professions, such as nursing, have gained more raises. But those exceptions aside, the union&#8217;s cumulative raises last year trailed inflation by about 50 percent.</p>
<p>Then Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ordered two furlough days for nearly all state workers. In July, he added a third, a roughly 14 percent pay reduction.</p>
<p>Now Local 1000 wages are back down to where they were five years ago, about 15 cents above that 1991 dollar.</p>
<p>Of course, inflation hasn&#8217;t taken any furlough days, so the union&#8217;s wages now trail the CPI by about 77 percent.</p>
<p>From one perspective, this is wonderful news that a bloated bureaucracy is getting serious about cutting back. Pensions next?</p>
<p>But if it&#8217;s your check that&#8217;s shrinking, it&#8217;s a disaster. </p></blockquote>
<p>The California government fiscal patterns deserve severe criticism, but hardly on the backs of average workers who are also unionized.  And wage negotiations have hardly been driven by unrealistic wage demands.  Of course, something keeps people there&#8230;it is worse in other regions, and other regions of the US can hardly accept an exodus of workers at this point either.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I&#8217;ve said before that the &#8220;Buy American&#8221; provisions in the stimulus bill were not exactly a major issue. (I believe the phrase was roughly, &#8220;could drive a broken Mexican truck through the holes, even if dead drunk.&#8221;)  Many economists (hi, <a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2009/02/revoke-krugmans-nobel-prize.html">Barkley</a>) disagreed, even while some acknowledged that the income effect from &#8220;buying American&#8221; would be <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2009/01/buy-domestic-policies-are-individually-irrational-too.html">mitigated by the substitution effect on the FX rate</a>, while others noted that reprisal threats <a target="_blank" href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2009/02/only-idiots-start-wars-they-cant-win.html">just might not be credible</a>.</p>
<p>But time went by, and Barry O. &#8220;yielded,&#8221; adding an explicit provision that &#8220;buy American&#8221; would <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/02/the-senate-and-buy-america.html">follow current trade agreements</a>—which the more aware economists later noted was basically an indication that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/02/ah-the-weaker-version-of-buy-america-is-not-quite-toothless-after-all.html">we will support &#8220;free trade&#8221; only if the other guy does</a>. (Sorry, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0102/p06s02-woap.html">China</a>.)</p>
<p>So now is the time for credit-taking.  And while <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/582767">the usual suspects</a> want to be credited, the reality of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.progressive-economics.ca/2009/02/05/who-saved-canadian-steel/">what they asked for and what they received</a> belies that claim.</p>
<p>Who came to the support of &#8220;free trade for free traders&#8221;?  Why, <a href="http://news.sympatico.msn.cbc.ca/World/ContentPosting?newsitemid=17821019&#038;feedname=CP-WORLD&#038;show=False&#038;number=0&#038;showbyline=True&#038;subtitle=&#038;detect=&#038;abc=abc&#038;date=True">the United Steelworkers Union, of course</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The news came only hours after the United Steelworkers pleaded Canada&#8217;s case to lawmakers from steel-producing states.</p>
<p>A written submission to the congressional steel committee from the Steelworkers&#8217; president, Canadian Leo Gerard, asked that legislators exempt Canada from the provision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we are an international union, and because Canadian and U.S. manufacturing is so integrated, we encourage you and other members of the steel caucus to approach your counterparts in Canada to discuss a co-ordinated approach,&#8221; Gerard&#8217;s submission read&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Steelworkers have said it&#8217;s Chinese steel, not Canadian, that&#8217;s the intended target of &#8220;Buy American.&#8221; American steel-makers have long accused China of employing unjust policies that give its steel manufacturers a competitive advantage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone wonder <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/steel-made-in-america-or-made-in-china.html">why they might believe that</a>?</p>
<p>And, needless to say, <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/op-ed-misplaced-handwringing-on.html">EconomistMom&#8217;s organization</a> is right in the middle of the fooforaw:<br />
<blockquote>The steel company executives who showed up for Wednesday&#8217;s caucus hearing were skeptical of the &#8220;Buy American&#8221; warnings.</p>
<p>Dan DiMicco, chief executive of Nucor Corp., dismissed as &#8220;garbage&#8221; a recent study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics that &#8220;Buy American&#8221; could cost, not save, thousands of U.S. jobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American people are with us and with you on this issue,&#8221; he told the steel caucus members.</p></blockquote>
<p>And they&#8217;re right.  The American people support free trade—with countries that allow us free trade.</p>
<p>It seems that only some economists cannot tell the difference.</p>

<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SUkM-t-3JEI/AAAAAAAAAL4/1LOpVLl2Yvo/s1600-h/CEO+math+cartoon.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SUkM-t-3JEI/AAAAAAAAAL4/1LOpVLl2Yvo/s400/CEO+math+cartoon.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Honda has <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/081217/as_japan_honda.html">done some math</a>,<br />
<blockquote>Honda Motor Co. now expects 185 billion yen ($2.06 billion) in group net profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 &#8212; less than a third of the 600 billion yen it earned last fiscal year.<br />For every yen the dollar declines, Honda loses about 18 billion yen ($200 million) in operating profit. In trading Wednesday, the dollar fell as low as 88.15 yen.</p></blockquote>
<p>And is making some changes based on the results: <br />
<blockquote>Underlining the tough times ahead, Fukui refused to set a vehicles sales target for 2009 &#8212; an unusual move for Honda.<br />To take responsibility for the faltering results, Honda directors will take a 10 percent pay cut and further bonus reductions are likely, he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Honda said it was pulling out of the glamorous but expensive Formula One racing to save costs and focus on its core car business.  (Hey, it&#8217;s not NASCAR so who care?  I do.)</p>
<p>Honda lowered its sales forecast for the fiscal year through March by 13 percent to 10.4 trillion yen ($116.9 billion).</p>
<p>The company also trimmed annual investment spending by 60 billion yen ($674 million) to about 650 billion yen ($7.3 billion) to cut costs during hard times, including scrapping plans to introduce the Acura luxury line in Japan by 2010. Plans to develop a successor to the NSX sportscar were also canceled.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are layoffs: <br />
<blockquote>Honda had already said it was cutting 760 temporary workers in Japan, or nearly 18 percent of its Japan temporary work force of 4,300. On Wednesday, Honda said another 450 temporary workers in Japan will be reduced through February. </p></blockquote>
<p> That&#8217;s all they have to cut?  No regulars getting the axe? Don&#8217;t they know it&#8217;s the workers fault?</p>
<p>Toyota has done some math too.<br />
<blockquote>Toyota is also reducing production. In a key setback, Toyota said earlier this week that it&#8217;s delaying indefinitely the start of production at its plant in Blue Springs, Mississippi. The plant had been scheduled to begin in 2010&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p> Hey Cochran baby, how&#8217;s that work&#8217;n for ya in old Mississippi? </p>
