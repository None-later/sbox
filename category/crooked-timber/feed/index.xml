				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brad DeLong culls the comments <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2011/03/30/with-notably-rare-exceptions/">to this post at Crooked Timber</a> to produce <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/03/the-best-of-with-notably-rare-exceptions.html">a &#8220;with notably rare exceptions&#8221; Greatest Hits package</a>—his second post riffing on the original—in honor of The Maestro continuing to attempt to improve the reputations of Paul Volcker and Ben Bernanke, if not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G._William_Miller">G. William (&#8220;I ran a company, I didn&#8217;t need to know about Finance&#8221;) Miller</a>.*</p>
<p>I point you to Dr. DeLong on the off chance that you didn&#8217;t read any of the other three (one by Henry, two by Brad) posts, while we all wait for <a href="http://www.nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/">Patrick or Jim MacDonald</a> to continue the riff with more variations.</p>
<p>Economics question of the day: whose productivity will be greater: someone who reads all (now four, counting this one) posts, someone who starts with Dr. DeLong&#8217;s second, someone who starts with Dr. DeLong&#8217;s first, or someone who only read Henry Farrell&#8217;s original post but kept clicking back to see the newer comments?</p>
<p>Explain your answer in terms of the value-added of aggregators and/or hedonic pricing. Best answers will be forwarded to Bill Dudley, the current leader of the FRB of New York, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1RNCN_enCA318CA319&#038;aq=0&#038;oq=let+them+eat+iP&#038;sourceid=chrome&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=let+them+eat+ipad">on the off chance he ever agrees to speak in Queens again</a>.<br />

</p>
<p>*I refuse to believe that Alan Greenspan is stupid enough to believe the things he&#8217;s saying now.  Next thing you know, he&#8217;ll be claiming that <a href="http://online.barrons.com/article/SB120917419049046805.html#articleTabs_panel_article%3D1">his Ph.D. thesis</a> was so perfect that <a href="http://online.barrons.com/article/SB120675340444773623.html">no one should ever read it</a>, lest they despair of following in his giant footsteps.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, go read <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2010/06/10/the-international-community/">Henry on the lambasting of, especially, Turkey by U.S. idiots</a>.  Apparently, any U.N. vote is wholly the responsibility of everyone except the people who presented the resolution.</p>
<p>Note also that the editorial page has a <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/22d4914e-73fc-11df-87f5-00144feabdc0.html">much more interesting piece on economics than all those Zogby myths</a>.  Maybe more about that later, but for now, let&#8217;s pull the appropriate (in more ways than one) quote:<br />
<blockquote>In reality, conflicts of interest abound – between buyers and sellers, short and long terms, equity and debt, taxpayers and shareholders. Context is all-important – the idiosyncrasies of age, financial circumstances and geography. How do we provide a &#8220;neutral&#8221; framework for such crooked timber?</p></blockquote>
