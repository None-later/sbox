<blockquote><p>And what did the—finally, the numbers that just came in in the <i>New York Times</i> article very recently that showed that—in the first year of recovery from the recession, which was taking place under President Obama, of the gains in income, 93 percent of those gains went to the top 1 percent in wealth. And we are in the greatest period of inequality measured since the Great Depression. And in terms of wealth, as opposed to income, the top 1 percent now have greater wealth than the bottom 90 percent of us in America. </p></blockquote>
