<p>The poll results are in on whether Jamie Dimon will resign from the board of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. By a 53%-40% majority, with 7% unsure, readers thought that Dimon would not step down in the wake of the huge supervision failure at JP Morgan, which led to its $3 billion and counting loss.    </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the pressure is building for him to resign. <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/05/17/geithner-to-dimon-resign-from-the-board-of-the-new-york-fed/">Simon Johnson</a>, whose article I first cited on this issue, has written new articles <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/05/19/the-need-for-an-independent-investigation-into-jp-morgan-chase/">calling for an investigation</a> into JP Morgan, <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/05/21/jamie-dimon-should-resign-from-the-board-of-the-new-york-fed/">calling for Dimon&#8217;s resignation</a>, and <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/05/24/jamie-dimon-and-the-legitimacy-of-the-federal-reserve-system/">taking on arguments</a> defending Dimon. Johnson has also <a href="http://www.change.org/petitions/jamie-dimon-must-resign-or-be-removed-from-the-new-york-federal-reserve-board-of-directors?utm_campaign=en_usa_ej&#038;utm_content=petition&#038;utm_medium=twitter&#038;utm_source=social_media&#038;utm_term=dimon_">started an online petition</a> calling for Dimon&#8217;s resignation or ouster.<br />    <br />Johnson is hardly alone, however. In recent days, others who have called for Dimon&#8217;s resignation include former Wall Street prosecutor and New York Governor <a href="http://current.com/shows/viewpoint/videos/spitzer-to-jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-resign-from-the-new-york-fed-board/">Eliot Spitzer,</a> Nobel Prize-winning economist <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/5/17/krugman_jamie_dimon_should_resign_over">Paul Krugman</a>, Massachusetts Senatorial candidate <a href="http://www.americablog.com/2012/05/elizabeth-warren-calls-for-jamie-dimons.html">Elizabeth Warren</a>, and today, Kansas City Fed President <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-24/george-says-fed-directors-should-meet-standards-or-resign.html">Esther George</a> said that Fed directors who don&#8217;t meet high standards should resign, which Johnson tweeted was &#8220;huge.&#8221;    </p>
<p>I was one who voted &#8220;no&#8221; on the poll, but the recent activity makes me think the odds must be increasing. And yes, I signed Johnson&#8217;s petition. </p>
