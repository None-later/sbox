				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to look at the <a href="http://graphicsweb.wsj.com/documents/NILF1111/#term=">WSJ job database</a>, suspecting what I might find, but currently lack the bandwidth in a major way.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Noah took some (more) time from his thesis (&#8220;distraction from productive activity&#8221;) and did the dirty work. Apparently, <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/bad-astronomy-does-some-bad-economics.html">being a STEM undergraduate isn&#8217;t the path to Nirvana</a>:*</p>
<blockquote><p>I went through the Wall Street Journal database that Phil cites, and found the following unemployment rates:</p>
<li>Genetics: 7.4% unemployed </li>
<li>Biochemical Sciences: 7.1% unemployed </li>
<li>Neuroscience: 7.2% unemployed </li>
<li>Materials Engineering and Materials Science: 7.5% unemployed </li>
<li>Computer Engineering: 7.0% unemployed </li>
<li>Biomedical Engineering: 5.9% unemployed </li>
<li>General Engineering: 5.9% unemployed </li>
<li>Engineering Mechanics Physics and Science: 6.5% unemployed </li>
<li>Chemistry: 5.1% unemployed </li>
<li>Electrical Engineering: 5.0% unemployed </li>
<li>Molecular Biology: 5.3% unemployed </li>
<li>Mechanical Engineering and Related Technologies: 6.6% unemployed
<p>Compare these with a <a href="http://www.mymoneyblog.com/unemployment-rates-vs-level-of-education.html">5.0% unemployment rate for all bachelor&#8217;s degree holders</a> in 2010.</li>
</blockquote>
<p>And why do those Astronomy and Astrophysics people** have jobs?<br />
<blockquote>Earth to [Phil Plait of] Bad Astronomy: your short-list of fully-employed science majors is totally cherry-picked&#8230;.And all those astronomers who have plenty of jobs? Guess what: they&#8217;re employed because <em>they work for the government</em>. Yep, that&#8217;s right, the same government whose ability to provide employment Phil laughs at.</p></blockquote>
<p>*Raise your hand if you&#8217;re surprised by this. Mine is not up.</p>
<p>**Full disclosure: I speak as someone whose wife&#8217;s cousin, with a Ph.D. in Astronomy &#038; Astrophysics, currently has a Fellowship in the Astronomy department at <a href="http://berkeley.edu/">DeLongville</a>.</p>
