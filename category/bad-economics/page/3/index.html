                                <p>I try not to pay attention—and not provide a direct link—to the NYT&#8217;s Stupidest Conservative. It&#8217;s one of the greatest advantages of having Susan of Texas around: you can go there and see <a href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/2011/01/every-sperm-is-ross-douthat-waiting-to.html">anything I might write, done better, and (in this case) with cute graphics</a>.</p>
<p>But when Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/01/ross-douthat-on-the-shortage-of-white-babies.html">falls down on the job</a>—dealing well with the social, but not at all with the economic, aspect—it is time to go once (and, I hope, only once) into the breach.</p>
<p>Douthat, as <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/01/ross-douthat-on-the-shortage-of-white-babies.html">quoted by DeLong</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Prior to 1973, 20 percent of births to white, unmarried women (and 9 percent of unwed births over all) led to an adoption. Today, just 1 percent of babies born to unwed mothers are adopted, and would-be adoptive parents face a waiting list that has lengthened beyond reason.</p></blockquote>
<p>First thing to note: these are not necessarily comparable sets, for reasons detailed by <a href="http://pandagon.net/index.php/site/comments/why_being_anti_choice_is_misogynist_period/">Amanda Marcotte</a> (op. cit. DeLong as well). Since the babies of today are conceived more voluntarily (in concept; <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/01/rich-stay-healthy-sick-stay-poor.html">my perpetual caveat about access</a> certainly abides here), you would expect those <em>eligible</em> to be adopted to decline as well. That is, the 19% drop (or 95% drop in percentage terms) in white babies being adopted (or maybe it&#8217;s a 8% drop from 9% to 1%, which would be 89% in percentage terms) is the effect you would expect with fewer &#8220;unwanted&#8221; births. People don&#8217;t offer children for adoption unless they can&#8217;t raise them.</p>
<p>So Douthat&#8217;s statistics do, if anything, show that overall life is <em><strong>improved</strong></em> since 1973. We can agree that fewer unwanted babies is a good thing, no?</p>
<p>But if I&#8217;m reading Douthat&#8217;s prose correctly, there&#8217;s a far greater structural problem. Concentrating only on &#8220;white&#8221; babies— that is, conceding that Douthat is considering a bare majority, if that, of the country—we see that the system he fondly remembers <em>produced a 20% surplus of children born out of wedlock for whom the state or its equivalents needed to care</em>.</p>
<p>Even ignoring the conditions under which many of those births occurred, that basically means that for one in every five children born out of wedlock, <em>no more than</em> four were successfully adopted.</p>
<p>The odds are that the ratio is much higher: after all, &#8220;births to white, unmarried women&#8221; is a large set. Some of those were likely by choice. Some of those likely were followed soon thereafter by marriage. Some of them had &#8220;pre-arranged&#8221; adoption within the family (or <em>de facto</em> adoption by the woman&#8217;s extended family; see Palin, Bristol, for a contemporary example).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the numbers, but if you told me that the above accounted for slightly more than half of the category, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised.</p>
<p>But that leaves about 40% of those babies needing to be adopted. And by Douthat&#8217;s own data, only 20% of them were.</p>
<p>So the <strong>best-case scenario</strong> is that, for each one of us who was adopted, there was a minimum of 1/4 of a person who wasn&#8217;t—and probably closer to a 1:1 ratio.</p>
<p>In Douthat&#8217;s world, women are supposed to feel guilty <em>ex post</em> because they made a decision. Does that mean that adoptees in the U.S. are supposed to feel guilty because they were adopted and someone else wasn&#8217;t? Or that our parents should feel guilty because they chose us, and not someone else?</p>
<p>From an economic analysis, the pre-1973 situation was one of significant excess supply, and the current 1% adoption rate is beneficial to the chances of a potential adoptee being adopted, while the &#8220;would-be adoptive parents [who] face a waiting list&#8221; have both an abundant opportunity to provide a relatively better lifestyle for children born in developing economies and to take interim steps such as fostering to ensure that they really want to change their lifestyle enough to raise children.</p>
<p>No economist in his right mind would consider the pre-1973 environment romanced by Douthat to be more optimal than the current one, unless he really loves human suffering and wasting human capital.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Tom Levenson at Balloon Juice <a href="http://www.balloon-juice.com/2011/01/05/further-to-douthat-babies-babies-everywhere/">went out and found some numbers</a> that—to no one&#8217;s surprise, I trust—don&#8217;t support Douthat&#8217;s Delusion either.</p>

                                <p>Update: Brad DeLong looks at the data and suggests that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/12/james-kwak-on-the-obama-renaissance.html">the problem may be that the current President is as innumerate as the previous one</a>.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/12/the-obama-renaissance.html">quotes James Kwak</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So no, I don’t think Obama is abandoning his principles for political advantage; I think these are his principles. And while I’m upset at him, I’m upset at him for being wrong on the policy level, not for abandoning anything or selling out&#8230;I always thought Obama was a moderate who looked like a progressive.</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m with Kwak on that; it&#8217;s one of the reasons I supported the relatively-more-progressive Hillary through the primaries.*</p>
<p>Where I&#8217;m less sanguine is the base from which Mark let him start:<br />
<blockquote>Obama is certainly in a decent position politically, and I would bet on him to be reelected comfortably in 2012.</p></blockquote>
<p>In 1996, Bill Clinton had the advantage of Bob Dole—the 1996 equivalent of Newt Gingrich—being his opponent.  Dole had been a known quantity to voters for over a decade (&#8220;Do you want Grits and Fritz or a Ford Dole?&#8221;) who supported Clarence Thomas, talked about Hideo Nomo of the Brooklyn Dodgers, and fell off the front of a stage—and still <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1996">garnered more than 40% of the vote, losing the popular vote by only slightly more votes than Ross Perot won</a>.  And that was after the advantage of a virtually-uncontested primary, which Mr. Obama may not enjoy.**</p>
<p>Kwak later backtracks a bit:<br />
<blockquote>I think two years would be enough time for labor markets to recover if we could expect policy supporting employment along the way. But we are likely to get just the opposite, deficit cutting measures and other policies that work against employment and hence work against electoral success for the Democrats. <em>Toss in a compromise on Social Security that angers the Democratic base, a possibility that cannot be dismissed as Obama follows up on what appears to be a successful move to the center, and the future does not look as bright.</em> Obama may think he is playing the game well now, but the game is far from over.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is at least far more accurate than the declaration that Obama won when his opening g4 was followed by the Republican&#8217;s e5.  And Thoma follows up with his expectation of Obama&#8217;s next move being f3:<br />
<blockquote>That would put an end to any stimulus due to the tax compromise. <em>Stimulating the economy was never the intent of the GOP when they agreed to the tax compromise, it was all about the estate tax and tax cuts for the wealthy.</em> They will do what they can to decrease government spending over the next two years, starting in January, and if they are successful it will reverse any benefit the economy might have received from the compromise.</p></blockquote>
<p>Given that we all agree on the likely next two years, it would be nice to see an economic model from either Mark or James Kwak that justifies the expectation that Obama is in a position &#8220;to be reelected comfortably in 2012.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the very least, I want to offer to bet with Mr. Kwak, at even odds, with proceeds to go to the charity of the winner&#8217;s choice. Here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.shelterfromthestorm.ca/">my choice</a>.</p>
<p>*The other being that she would know from the start that she was hated, and be ready for bear at the outset. (As an aside: sorry, <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/">Scott</a>, but hiring Mark Penn, while a mistake, is not a revelation of policy preferences. Or, if you want to argue it is, tell us what replacing Howard Dean and the 50-State Strategy with Tim Kaine and Suborning Democrats such as Sibelius and Napolitano into the Administration is.)</p>
<p>**I say this not only because I would like to see him challenged—his doing a Specter in 2011 is about the only hope for my grandchildren—but also because it makes sense to prepare the field for 2016 and beyond.  It would be dumber of the Democrats <em>not</em> to have someone challenge him in the primary, leaving only HRC and Joe Biden as probably 2016 candidates, than it would be to unite behind him in the hope that Republicans nominate someone who is unelectable a la Dole in 1996.</p>

<blockquote>It is not technocratic economists who will win the day and pull us out of our cul-de-sac, but angry Irishmen and Spaniards who challenge, on moral terms, the right of German bankers to impose vast deadweight costs on current activity because they lent greedily into what might easily have been recognized as a property and credit bubble.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>First, there was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Where-Customers-Yachts-Street-Marketplace/dp/0471119784">Fred Schwed&#8217;s <em>Where are the Customer&#8217;s Yachts?</em></a>, which is still the standard bearer for why Money Managers are overpaid.</p>
<p>Now (via <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/27/your-money/27money.html?hp=&#038;pagewanted=print">the NYT</a>) there is <a href="http://www.theinvestmentanswerbook.com/buy.html">The Investment Answer</a> (preface <a href="http://www.theinvestmentanswerbook.com/The_Investment_Answer.pdf">here</a> [PDF]).</p>
<p>The Prologue opens more Matt Taibbi than Jason Zweig:<br />
<blockquote>Wall Street brokers and active money managers use your relative lack of investment expertise to their benefit&#8230;not yours</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, they have a method That Will Work to solve this, which looks suspicuously like what those Active Money Managers <em>say</em> they do.  And what you would think Economic Theory would tell you to do, which may be why they have the endorsement of Eugene (&#8220;the markets are too efficient&#8221;) Fama among many others.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s time for economists to model why economic theory doesn&#8217;t work?</p>
<p>The last time people realized their money managers were taking them for a ride, <a href="http://chinese-school.netfirms.com/Warren-Buffett-interview.html">the market basically sat still for a generation</a>.  Whether this dying text is a leading indicator is left as an exercise, though not an academic one.</p>

                                <p>lifted from <strong>comments by spencer </strong>on <strong>Mike Kimel&#8217;s</strong> post <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/11/very-bad-economic-theory.html">Very bad economic theory (historiography)</a></p>
<p>From <a target="_blank href=" http:>Real Civilian GDP</a> in July this year.</p>
<blockquote><p>From 1933 to 1950 real civilian GDP grew at a 5.6% growth rate even though it fell -18.4% and -14.8% in  <br />1943 and 1944 &#8212; a decline about the same as the drop in 1929-33. </p></blockquote>
<p>The analysis that the economy boomed after WW II by Henderson is really bad analysis, largely because it omits so much information, some of which Mike has pointed out.  But mainly it omits the information on &#8220;forced savings&#8221; during WW II that provided people the means to finance the post war increase in spending.  To say the post war economy happened without government policy playing a significant role is just blatantly misleading and dishonest.  Second, no one brought up the question of what happened to all the women who had been drawn into the labor force during WW II like by mother who was a Rosy the Riveter in the local aluminum plant in eastern Tennessee.  Like most of her fellow female workers she silently went home and started having babies.  In other words they dropped out of the labor force and this created openings for the returning servicemen.  This movement in and out of the labor force of female wartime workers massively distorted the data but of course no is pointing this out in the analysis. That is why the labor force contracted in 1946.  Note Henderson did not say anything about this.  </p>
<p>Moreover, his analysis of Germany is just as blatantly misleading in that it says nothing about the Marshall Plan or the German currency reform.   The German recovery did not really start until after the currency reform of 1948.</p>

                                <p>By Daniel Becker</p>
<p>I just want to lay out the debate going on in our economy right now. There are 4 debaters. President Obama/Geithner et al, President Obama 2008, the rich (or capitalist, those who make their money from money) and the rest of us. </p>
<p>From President Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/07/60minutes/main7032277.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody">60 Minute interview</a>: </p>
<p>
<blockquote>PRESIDENT OBAMA:&#8230;And it turns out that actually the people who are most likely to use that money and spend that money are actually people of more modest means, and if what we&#8217;re concerned about is how we can grow the economy, there are more efficient ways to recirculate dollars out there and get people to spend.</p>
<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA:&#8230;But probably the biggest uncertainty right now for a lotta companies is there gonna be enough demand out there for the products, and we&#8217;ve gotta make sure that we&#8217;re workin&#8217; with them to try to improve that. </p>
<p>KROFT: You&#8217;ve got a situation right now that banks have not significantly loosened up credit in spite of all the money that they&#8217;ve received, in spite of the fact that they&#8217;re quite profitable right now. And you&#8217;ve got manufacturing companies that haven&#8217;t replaced many of the jobs or hired back the people that they&#8217;ve cut. How do you get the banks to loan money, and how do you get businesses to hire people back? </p>
<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, it starts with businesses wanting to hire people back because they see customers out there. And so everything that we can do to expand consumer confidence, everything that we can do to get businesses to invest in plants and equipment through the tax code, through accelerated depreciation, through keeping taxes on middle class families where they are, as opposed to having them spike up &#8212; all that can make a difference. The more companies are doing well, the more likely they are to go to banks and say, &#8220;We need to borrow.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The two Obama&#8217;s are struggling to have it both ways and thus the lack of action on issues such as easing unionization while going to <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/801-economy/127651-ford-slams-south-korea-trade-deal-as-obama-officials-renew-talks">South Korea for a trade deal</a> ala <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/106607-south-korean-trade-deal-pits-obama-against-labor-">NAFTA</a>. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />However, the other 2 parties in this debate have been very clear for years now. I present “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102609/quotes">Other People&#8217;s Money” 1991</a> </p>
<p>The Capitalist represented by Lawrence Garfield:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Ah, but we can&#8217;t,&#8221; goes the prayer. &#8220;We can&#8217;t because we have responsibility, a responsibility to our employees, to our community. What will happen to them?&#8221; I got two words for that: Who cares? Care about them? Why? They didn&#8217;t care about you. They sucked you dry. You have no responsibility to them. For the last ten years this company bled your money. Did this community ever say, &#8220;We know times are tough. We&#8217;ll lower taxes, reduce water and sewer.&#8221; Check it out: You&#8217;re paying twice what you did ten years ago. And our devoted employees, who have taken no increases for the past three years, are still making twice what they made ten years ago; and our stock &#8211; one-sixth what it was ten years ago. Who cares? I&#8217;ll tell you. Me. I&#8217;m not your best friend. I&#8217;m your only friend. I don&#8217;t make anything? I&#8217;m making you money. And lest we forget, that&#8217;s the only reason any of you became stockholders in the first place. You want to make money! You don&#8217;t care if they manufacture wire and cable, fried chicken, or grow tangerines! You want to make money! I&#8217;m the only friend you&#8217;ve got. I&#8217;m making you money. Take the money. Invest it somewhere else. Maybe, maybe you&#8217;ll get lucky and it&#8217;ll be used productively. And if it is, you&#8217;ll create new jobs and provide a service for the economy and, God forbid, even make a few bucks for yourselves. And if anybody asks, tell &#8217;em ya gave at the plant. And by the way, it pleases me that I am called &#8220;Larry the Liquidator.&#8221; You know why, fellow stockholders? Because at my funeral, you&#8217;ll leave with a smile on your face and a few bucks in your pocket. Now that&#8217;s a funeral worth having! </p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of us represented by Andrew Jorgenson:</p>
<blockquote><p>“&#8230;The entrepreneur of post-industrial America, playing God with other people&#8217;s money. The robber barons of old at least left something tangible in their wake- a coal mine, a railroad, banks. This man leaves nothing. He creates nothing. He builds nothing. He runs nothing. And in his wake lies nothing but a blizzard of paper to cover the pain. Oh, if he said, &#8220;I know how to run your business better than you,&#8221; that would be something worth talking about. But he&#8217;s not saying that. He&#8217;s saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna kill you because at this particular moment in time, you&#8217;re worth more dead than alive.&#8221; Well, maybe that&#8217;s true, but it is also true that one day this industry will turn. One day when the yen is weaker, the dollar is stronger, or when we finally begin to rebuild our roads, our bridges, the infrastructure of our country, demand will skyrocket&#8230;.God save us if we vote to take his paltry few dollars and run. God save this country if that is truly the wave of the future. We will then have become a nation that makes nothing but hamburgers, creates nothing but lawyers, and sells nothing but tax shelters. And if we are at that point in this country, where we kill something because at the moment it&#8217;s worth more dead than alive, well, take a look around. Look at your neighbor. Look at your neighbor. You won&#8217;t kill him, will you? No. It&#8217;s called murder, and it&#8217;s illegal. Well, this, too, is murder, on a mass scale. Only on Wall Street, they call it maximizing shareholder value, and they call it legal. And they substitute dollar bills where a conscience should be. Damn it! A business is worth more than the price of its stock. It&#8217;s the place where we earn our living, where we meet our friends, dream our dreams. It is, in every sense, the very fabric that binds our society together. So let us now, at this meeting, say to every Garfield in the land, here, we build things, we don&#8217;t destroy them.

<blockquote>It really makes one understand why the public often dismisses academics as out of touch in their ivory towers. One has to imagine that neither Mulligan nor Mankiw ever held a real summer job. Nor, apparently, have they looked at any other nonseasonally adjusted data. Nor do they appear to have much understanding of the basic ebb and flow of US economic activity over the course of the year&#8230;.</p>
<p>It seems to entirely escape them that aggregate demand has a very predictable season pattern &#8211; a seasonal pattern that exists in a recession or expansion.</p>
<p>These seasonal patterns in demand activity are not new. Indeed, I imagine that if the data existed, we would see the pattern has remained virtually unchanged since the dawn of human existence, as least in parts of the world where seasonal weather patterns govern economic life. Indeed, it is the reason we have an influx of teenage labor in the summer. It is a throwback to the days of America&#8217;s agricultural past, when the DEMAND for additional labor in the summer months necessitated closing schools for the summer.</p>
<p>As sure as the sun rises each day and winter turns to spring, sales spike at the end of the year as the holiday season approaches, collapse at the beginning of the year, rise in the summer, and then decline in the fall&#8230;</p>
<p>You can set your clock to this trend. Every retail analyst knows this trend. Every teenager who has ever held a summer job knows this trend. And a huge swath of data follows similar trends, albeit usually without the pronounced end of year impact. Building activity, waste disposal, tourism, you name it, it has a seasonal demand pattern. I only have to look out my ivory tower to see it &#8211; stuff grows faster in the summer, and the city hires crews of teenagers to cut it back. The pool down the road is open and staffed by teenage lifeguards only in the summer. Not because the lifeguards are available, but because there is no demand for an outdoor pool most of the year in Eugene.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>By Daniel Becker (DOLB)</p>
<p>Following up on <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/05/progressives-views-on-supply.html">Robert&#8217;s post</a> which at it&#8217;s core is discussing the article: <a href="http://econjwatch.org/articles/economic-enlightenment-in-relation-to-college-going-ideology-and-other-variables-a-zogby-survey-of-americans">Economic Enlightenment in Relations to College-going&#8230;.</a></p>
<p>I find it interesting (not alarming at all, at least not regarding the data) that the following combination is the ultimate economically enlightened member of society if you are: </p>
<blockquote><p>very likely to vote next time, voted for McCain, libertarian, white, not Hispanic/Latino, a suburbanite, atheist/realist/humanist, born again, attend church multi times/ week, non union, married, consider America you residence, are military (or family in military), NASCAR fan, think your in the investor class, shop every week at Walmart, earn over $100K/yr, male.</p></blockquote>
<p>One more thing based on their figure 2 chart: high school education or less. That group of educated had the highest economic enlightenment score.  That group of educated had the highest economic enlightenment score. There is a bit of concern with this data piece considering two of their sited points:</p>
<blockquote><p>The caveat that we see as most significant as pertains to the education variable is that the survey procedure likely tended to discourage low-IQ individuals from participation, thus artificially raising the observed economic enlightenment scores of the less educated groups&#8230; </p></blockquote>
<p>And: <br />
<blockquote>Meanwhile, Caplan and Miller (2006)&#8230;find that “the estimated effect of education sharply falls after controlling for IQ. In fact, education is driven down to second place, and IQ replaces it at the top of the list of variables that make people ‘think like economists.’”</p></blockquote>
<p>Do I dare suggest that they are finding that the most economically enlightened are the smartest people who never finished high school? You know, when I asked 2 years ago if we could try a different school of economic&#8217;s I did not realize the one we needed was the non-schooled school. </p>
<p>Interestingly enough, you are most unenlightened if you are </p>
<blockquote><p>progressive and college educated along with being: not likely to vote, voted green party, identify Green, African American, Hispanic/Latino, large city dweller, no religious affiliation, not born again and never attend church, union, civil union/domestic partner, consider your home the planet earth (no other planet offered), not military, not a fan of NASCAR (should have asked about horse racing), not of the investor class, never shop at Walmart (guess the other big boxes don&#8217;t count), $25K or less/yr (and they don&#8217;t shop at Walmart?), female.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an amazing study. It managed to show that there are two groups of people in this nation whose thinking regarding money is totally reflective of the common cliche&#8217;s heard during the political season (which is a season with no ends) and are often applied slanderously. They have proven that the cliche&#8217;s are true!  But, then why would I expect anything else from this considering the following commentary from their “scholarly” piece of work: </p>
<blockquote><p>At least since the days of Frédéric Bastiat, many have said that people of the left often trail behind in incorporating basic economic insight into their aesthetics, morals, and politics. We put much stock in Hayek’s theory (Hayek 1978, 1979, 1988) that the social-democratic ethos is an atavistic reassertion of the ethos and mentality of the primordial paleolithic band, a mentality resistant to ideas of spontaneous order and disjointed knowledge. Our findings support such a claim,</p></blockquote>
<p>Ok, this economic ignoramus needs to go to his flower shop now. God help me if it goes under. I should have never gone to college. It&#8217;s my mom&#8217;s fault too.</p>

                                <p>Even more than Digby on CalPERS, the one piece everyone should read today is <a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/02/international-travel-redux.html">Charlie Stross on International Travel</a>.  Since this is an economics blog, let&#8217;s pull a key section:<br />
<blockquote>Here&#8217;s the rub: security is a state of mind, not a procedure. Procedures can&#8217;t cope with attackers, because they&#8217;re inflexible. If you search passengers for guns, someone will carry a knife. If you search for knives, someone will sew themselves a set of underwear full of PETN. And so on. To deal with a threat — say, someone who wants to attack your air travel infrastructure — you must look for the attacker, not their tools, because they can change their tools at will to exploit weaknesses in your procedure for identifying tools.</p>
<p>JFK is wide open to terrorists intent on causing mass casualties&#8230;.</p>
<p>Schiphol — Amsterdam airport — gets the security screening right, or at least less wrong than JFK and most other airports. Rather than having a hideous bottleneck between check-in and the departure area, security screening is carried out at each depature gate, with a separate metal detector and X-ray belt; no huge crowds form in unsecured areas. On US-bound flights, someone who clearly isn&#8217;t a minimum-wage drone checks ID documents and asks a couple of questions that seem to me to the aimed at flushing out anyone who is disturbed or tense — a crude form of profiling.[italics his; boldfacing mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>South Carolina Senator Jim DeMint preferred to <a href="http://whitehouse.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/01/20/fmr-tsa-nominee-disputes-senators-claim-over-unionization/">let the TSA remain leaderless for the past year</a> in fear of unionization of the workers.  As he explained to CNN:<br />

</p>
<p>Or, as quoted by Mark &#8220;neither Ernest nor earnest&#8221; Hemingway the Washington Examiner, in a piece oh-so-sensibly entitled <a href="http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/blogs/beltway-confidential/Napolitano-wants-to-unionize-TSA-employees-despite-safety-concerns-80206432.html">Napolitano wants to unionize TSA employees despite safety concerns</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The administration is intent in on unionizing and submitting our airport security to union bosses [and] collective bargaining, and this is at a time, as Senator Lieberman says, we&#8217;ve got to use our imagination we&#8217;ve got to be constantly flexible. We have to out think the terrorists. When we formed the airport security system we realize we could not use collective bargaining and unionization because of that need to be flexible. Yet that appears to be the top priority of the administration.</p></blockquote>
<p>But DeMint was much clearer on the Senate floor, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBs1OEEakNU&#038;feature=channel">speaking to Fox</a>:<br />
<blockquote>It makes absolutely no sense to submit the security of our airports and the passengers here in this country to collective bargaining with unions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which, of course, is why police and fire departments are all non-union as well.</p>
<p>The people you attract to any job—by your deliberate practices, not &#8220;unintended consequence&#8221;—are those who cannot get a job that they know to be more stable, pays better, has better benefits, or provide a more friendly work atmosphere.  By your policies and procedures, you reveal the type of worker you prefer.  This is as true of the TSA as it is of Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>In the case of the TSA, though, the combination produces the natural hire as the people who couldn&#8217;t get a job at Applebee&#8217;s, The Olive Garden, or Ruby Tuesday&#8217;s.</p>
<p>As Paul Kedrosky recently noted, it&#8217;s more &#8220;<a href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2010/02/adventures_in_a_1.html">security theater</a>&#8221; than security.  So when DeMint compares the TSA to the FBI, he&#8217;s neglecting that <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel02/hire012302.htm">the average staring salary at the FBI <em>eight years ago</em> was over $43,000—with an increase of at least $10,000 upon completion of training</a>.  This is $20,000-$30,000 a year more than the $12/hour my neighbor made when he started with the TSA. (He quit quickly, finding restaurant work more profitable.)</p>
<p>If you want security, you pay for people who know how to do security.  If you want theater, you depend on Jim DeMint to ensure that the TSA remains leaderless, and then have no right to be surprised when a British novelist points out that your security isn&#8217;t secure.  Even when he says:<br />
<blockquote>Suppose I wanted to attack the US air travel infrastructure&#8230;.I can kill lots of passengers! All I need to do is to buy a maximum-size carry on bag (US dimensions: 7&#8243; x 13&#8243; x 20&#8243;) and build the biggest, heaviest bomb into it that I can wheel behind me&#8230;.</p>
<p>All I would have to do then is buy a ticket&#8230;and go queue. Then, when I get to the middle of the crowd, detonate the device. (For added horrors: have an accomplice with a similar device hang back, to detonate their bomb amidst the fleeing survivors.)</p>
<p>[S]ecurity checkpoints are a target, too, because they slow down travellers and cause crowds to form, and another term for &#8220;crowd&#8221; is &#8220;convenient target&#8221;. And because the attacker has not been separated from their weapon at the point when they reach such a target, it&#8217;s the logical weak point for causing maximum damage.</p></blockquote>
