<p>[edited to correct typos and add link to CTJ and Leonhardt articles 2/19pm]</p>
<p>Kevin Hassett, an economic grunt at the American Enterprise Institute and frequent contributor to the Wall Street Journal op-ed pages, prepared a report for the institute on corporate taxation.  Guess what&#8211;it claims that the US overtaxes its corporations and that is the reason that we are losing jobs.</p>
<p>There are all sorts of things wrong with this report.</p>
<p>1) it disregards the impact of globalization on corporate decisions to move enterprises, and the fungibility of operations if jurisidictions left don&#8217;t make the exit a highly taxing moment.  It also disregards the lack of protection for US workers&#8211;yes, US workers are better paid than workers in undeveloped countries, and if multinational enterprises (MNEs) can merely substitute the one for the other, they will. </p>
<p>2) It first spends a lot of ink on the US statutory rate, complaining that it is higher than that of most other OECD countries.  That is true, but really meaningless in itself.  You can&#8217;t have a decent understanding of a country&#8217;s tax policies without looking at both tax rates and the base against which they are assessed.  Since the corporate tax base in the US has more holes than Swiss cheese, looking at the rate tells you almost nothing about the corporate burden.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>3) It notes that corporate taxes raise much less in revenue as a percent of GDP in the US than in other OECD countries.  Somehow, the report intends this to be an indictment of the US corporate tax system as overtaxing corporations.  I suppose the authors reach that by implying that corporations have fled the system and that&#8217;s why.  But it is really an indication that the thesis in the title of the report&#8211;that the US gets an F for bad taxes that are making US corporations uncompetitive&#8211;is wrong. The US has such a loophole riddled corporate tax system that corporations are easily able to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. IN fact, other countries have more effective tax systems that get more corporate taxes out of their corporations as a percent of GDP, so the US must be a tax haven.  It is rather surprising that we haven&#8217;t had an upsurge of grass-roots, tea party-style protests against all the big MNEs that manage to benefit mightily from the use of tax revenues (from roads to water to workers&#8217; comp to subsidized health care) yet pay next to nothing in taxes in return. </p>
<p>For some examples of these MNEs with low taxes and much use of benefits, see David Leonhardt, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/business/economy/02leonhardt.html">The Paradox of Corporate Taxes in America</a>, New York Times, Feb. 2, 2011 .  Leonhard points out that Carnival Corporation &#8220;wouldn&#8217;t have much of a business without help from various branches of government&#8221; from the Coast Guard to Customs to road building and bridges and port maintenance, but the biggest benefit mayh be the price it pays, since it has only paid total (federal, state, local and foreign) taxes over the last five years equal to 1.1% of its $11.3 billion in profits.&#8221;  Other major US corporations with substantial economic profits pay corporate taxes less than 10%&#8211;Yahoo (7%), Boeing (4.5%), Prudential Financial (7.6%).  Id.  (And wasn&#8217;t Prudential  one of the banks that got to use the Treasury&#8217;s ultra vires notice permitting banks that acquired other banks to use their losses without the strict limitation provided in the tax code section 382?)</p>
<p>4) It claims that the US corporations&#8217; effective tax rate is still way higher than for other countries.  To do this, it uses two formulaic calculations for effective tax rates, neither of which is particularly trustworthy as to actual effective tax rates. It finds that its two hypothetical measures of effective tax rates come out at 29% and 23.6%.  These are probably too high, but are considerably less than the statutory rate. it doesn&#8217;t, for example, look at the amount of actual taxes paid compared to the amount of taxable income reported.  That figure would suggest a higher effective rate than actually experienced, since taxable income is much less than economic income.  It doesn&#8217;t do what makes even more sense, look at actual <em>current taxes </em>paid as noted on financial statements of reporting companies compared to <em>economic income </em>as noted on financial statements of reporting companies.  That number would be fairly accurate, and in fact comes out very low indeed.  See, e.g., CTJ study, Revenue<a href="http://www.ctj.org/pdf/corporatetaxreform.pdf">-Positive Reform of the Corporate Income tax</a>, Jan 25, 2011 (noting that a Bush study in 2007 found only a 13.4% effective tax rate for 2000-2005, compared to a 16.1% rate for other OECD countries). </p>
<p>5)  In comparing US corporations&#8217; statutory taxes to those in other OECD coutnries, it takes into accout state and local corporate taxation (average) rates.  But note that the US has primarily corporate income taxes, while OECD countries may have a host of other taxes, including in most cases a substantial value-added tax system (VAT).  The report doesn&#8217;t bring that tax into the comparison.  As a result, its comparison is again meaningless, because it isn&#8217;t really comparing the overall tax burden to determine whether the US corporations are in fact paying tax haven rates or being stymied in competition. </p>
<p>6) And of course, these corporate excusers provide only the slimmest of rationales for asserting that the US is aided by improving the competitiveness of MNEs in other countries&#8211;usually along the lines that helping them invest more abroad will also have a spillover effect in terms of more investment here.  Actually if we help them succeed there by reducing taxes here, we are cutting off our noses to spite our face, since they will move operations there and do less here. We&#8217;d be much better off using that money to fund education and basic scientific research that can improve our quallity of life and give us new things to manufacture! </p>
<p>As usual with the AEI, the ideological agenda has resulted in a report that primarily serves a propaganda purpose.  I&#8217;d say that it isn&#8217;t US corporate taxes that get an F, but rather this AEI report!</p>

<blockquote><p>This is my last post and I want to thank Jim and Justin [Miller, of the Atlantic web team] for the wonderful opportunity to be a guest blogger.  It has been a fun gig, but quite frankly I am running out of steam.  But life is an interplay of chance and necessity, and serendipity has just offered up a chance for a final blast.<br />For several years now, I have been in a analytical battle with an official in the Department of Defense over the question of whether Republicans or Democrats are better for the economy. <a name="more"></a><br />Newk A. Mineshaftgap is the pseudonym of a senior career official in the Pentagon, with a civilian rank comparable to that of a general in the military. He must remain anonymous for policy reasons &#8212; to borrow from the insightful reasoning used by President Merkin Muffley in Dr. Strangelove,  Minesthaftgap cannot get into a policy fight, because he works in the &#8220;the war room.&#8221;<br />I can tell you this: Newk has a PhD in physics, but he is not a geek.  In fact, he is a bit of polymath, with wide ranging interests, including nuclear weapons, ballistic missile defense, battleship and tank design, global warming and carbon default swaps, economics, and the development of metrics for measuring the quality of medical doctors.   I have known Newk for about 20 years and consider him to be a good and most interesting friend with solid if somewhat eccentric instincts.  Politically, I would categorize Newk as an independent with libertarian biases.<br />So, as my last blast, let me offer the <a href="http://www.chaliventures.com/Links_to_Reports/Links_to_Idisk_files/Are%20Republicans%20or%20Democrats%20Better%20for%20the%20Economy%3F.pdf">following link</a> [PDF]  to Newk&#8217;s latest report on whether Republicans or Democrats are better for the economy.  For a knuckle dragger from the Pentagon, his conclusions might surprise you.<br />___

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/11/tax-cuts-and-deficit-commissions.html"><strong>Tax cuts and deficit commissions</strong></a><br />crossposted with <strong>Ataxingmatter</strong>
<p>The game continues, as Republicans hold out for tax cuts for the wealthy (who are garnering increasing amounts of the total income) and various &#8220;deficit commissions&#8221; put out austerity plans that all call for cutting Social Security benefits and Medicare benefits.</p>
<p>Alice Rivlin, who spoke here at my campus some time ago, seemed clearly to have cutting Social Security and Medicare in mind even then.  See A<a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2010/04/alice-rivlin-on-financial-reform-and-deficits.html">lice Rivlin on Financial Reform and Deficits, ataxingmatter</a>.  She is now &#8220;trying to stir a debate&#8221; about a national sales tax, according to Bloomberg.  Przybyla, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-17/rivlin-proposes-6-5-national-sales-tax-as-part-of-deficit-reduction-plan.html">Rivlin Proposes 6.5% National Sales Tax as Part of Deficit-Reduction Plan</a>, Nov. 17, 2010.  See also Jackie Calmes, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/us/politics/17fiscal.html">New Deficit Reduction Plan from Bipartisan Group</a>, NY Times, Nov. 17, 2010.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now Rivlin is one of those Clintonites who is a right-center Democrat and, like so many of the Clinton and Obama advisers, close to the banking elite as a former Federal Reserve vice chairperson.  She claims her plan would be good for the country, but it isn&#8217;t so clear to me.  Growth for growth&#8217;s sake, we learn, doesn&#8217;t work very well.  Tax cuts for businesses don&#8217;t necessarily translate into US economic growth&#8211;they may just lead to higher executive compensation and bigger buybacks of shares for shareholders.  Tax cuts for the wealthy don&#8217;t lead to more jobs:  the claim that &#8220;small businesses&#8221; are helped when their owners aren&#8217;t forced to pay the piddling (for them) additional taxes that would be due if the Bush cuts for the wealthiest were not renewed is a farce&#8211;there are very few businesses that even fall into the wealthy owner category, and those businesses aren&#8217;t likely to invest a penny more in jobs just because their owners get even wealthier with bigger tax cuts.</p>
<p>The Rivlin plan is a combination of significant tax cuts (lowering corporate rates, even though corporations&#8217; effective tax rates are already at the international norm and perhaps lower if all is taken into account), freezing domestic spending (even though the unemployed, underemployed and vulnerable elderly and poor will need more support, not less, and even though infrastructure projects require additional funding and everything from education to food and drug inspection to disease control are already short-staffed); limit federal spending on health care for the elderly while raising Medicare premiums, eliminate most deductions and credits, cut the Social Security benefits (changing the cost-of-living adjustments and reducing growth in benefits for the top 25% of beneficiaries), give a one-year Social Security payroll tax holiday (aimed, I wager, to make Social Security look like it is insolvent and therefore in need of cuts and privatization), and add a national sales tax of 6.5% (terribly regressive).</p>
<p>The claim is that this combination of tax and spending cuts with the sales tax will increase economic growth and therefore create jobs.  I&#8217;m not convinced. </p>
<p>Even Bloomberg&#8217;s reporter recognizes that the real purpose of these sorts of trial balloons is to &#8220;paint[] an even starker picture of the measures needed to tame the debt&#8221; and thereby &#8220;sell unpopular remedies&#8221;.    Aha.  The real purpose for Rivlin&#8217;s new visibility is as the &#8220;bad cop&#8221; of the bad cop-good cop act that has as its goal to sell Americans on the need to end Social Security as we know it, to cut back on our societal commitment to provide decent medical care to the aged, and to carry out even more tax cuts for the benefit of our growing oligarchic class.  Yet the Social Security funds&#8211;paid in by workers and their employers&#8211;have been used to reduce the federal operating deficit for years, a process that was carred to extremes under Bush to fund the Bush tax cuts and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.</p>
<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341cf2a753ef013489295d69970c-pi"><img title="Federal deficit and Soc Sec Surpluses.OMB. 2010-11-09-Screenshot20101109at5_12_30PM" border="0" alt="Federal deficit and Soc Sec Surpluses.OMB. 2010-11-09-Screenshot20101109at5_12_30PM" src="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/.a/6a00d8341cf2a753ef013489295d69970c-800wi"></a>    <br />Source: OMB via <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-fiderer/the-bush-tax-cuts-and-the_b_781419.html">Huffington Post</a></p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t Rivlin just support changing the current funding mechanism for Social Security so that it will be a tax on 100% of wages and on capital gains, as is Medicare?  Why not support nonrenewal of the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans?  Why not support continued tightening of the corporate tax code, including restrictions on tax-free reorganizations that permit US multinationals to grow bigger and richer and more powerful (and too big to fail)?  Why not recognize that the deficit isn&#8217;t nearly as bad a problem as the increase in inequality in our country and the potential for an oligarchic takeover of our society? </p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t jobs the real need, whether or not we do something now or later to limit the deficit?  Shouldn&#8217;t we spend money to create jobs, if we have to?  Infrastructure and education are two public goods that the government can fund while at the same time creating jobs.  We can worry about the deficit later.  Or we can just decide not to renew any of the Bush tax cuts.  Nobody was clamoring for tax cuts when the Republicans pushed the first through in 2001, so let them go and we&#8217;ll all be back more or less where we were then.  We&#8217;ll manage.   If you don&#8217;t think so, look at this Tax Policy Center (Urban Institute/Brookings Institution) <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/General_Explanation_CL_CP.cfm">analysis of the impact of the expiration of the 2001-2003 Tax Cuts</a>.  Extending the cuts would result in an average effective tax rate reduction for all taxpayers of 2.7 percentage points (&#8220;current policy&#8221;) compared with letting them expire (&#8220;current law&#8221;).  Renewing the cuts gives the biggest cuts, both in dollar and percentage points, to the highest income taxpayers.</p>

<p>If raising taxes on the rich is not possible politically now and raising taxes on the middle class possibly hard on the recovery, then at least do nothing other than extend them for a year or two while the country gets back on its feet.  And then let them go, along with a repeal of the preferential rate for capital gains and the extension of Social Security to full income.  Problem solved, and people put back to work. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Republicans are intent on letting the deficit go wherever so long as they can get the tax cuts they want most&#8211;for the wealthiest taxpayers amongst us. See, e.g., MichaelTomasky&#8217;s Blog, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/michaeltomasky/2010/nov/17/congress-useconomy-tax-battle-lines-drawn">Tax Battle Lines Drawn</a> (Nov. 17, 2010).   Camp, Republican from Michigan, says the GOP would be &#8220;foolish&#8221; to go along with any idea to renew tax cuts for 80% of Americans without giving a tax break to the wealthy at the same time.  Everybody knows that the GOP wants to make those Bush tax cuts that were designed to expire into permanent reductions in tax revenues.  See e.g. (but note my &#8220;caution&#8221; below),  <a href="http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=40011">Will Obama Extend the Bush Tax Cuts?</a>, Human Events (Nov. 16, 2010) (indicating that &#8220;Republicans said they are still determined to make all of the Bush tax cuts permanent, rejecting White House overtures to decouple the top rates for a shorter extension&#8221;).  And the biggest beneficiaries are the GOP&#8217;s primary backers&#8211;the wealthy and big business&#8211;not the jobless.  See, e.g., &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/16/AR2010111607468_pf.html">GOP to Jobless: Drop Dead</a>&#8220;, Washington Post (Nov. 16, 2010).</p>
<p>(<em>CAUTION</em>&#8211;the &#8220;human events&#8221; blog just cited is a right-wing propaganda sheet scattered with contextually faulty or otherwise typically misleading statements , such as claiming that the scheduled expiration of the Bush cuts &#8220;could plunge the economy into another recession&#8221; or quoting Michael Steele in saying that the Republicans are fighting to &#8220;permanently stop the Democrats&#8217; tax hikes&#8221; &#8211;even though, of course, the scheduled expiration of the Bush tax cuts was designed by the Republicans as a way to fool the people about the actual multi-trillion-dollar cost and if the expiration of the Bush cuts according to schedule is a tax hike (which I&#8217;d dispute), it is a Republican one and not a Democratic one). </p>
<p>Polls fairly consistently show that Americans think at least the cuts for the wealthy should expire and possibly the cuts for all of us.   A recent poll shows that about a third of Americans think we shouldn&#8217;t renew any of the tax cuts, and another third think that at least we shouldn&#8217;t renew the tax cuts on the wealthy&#8211;that means that there&#8217;s a 2-1 vote against renewing the tax cuts for the wealthy.   See Steinhauser, <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/09/14/do-americans-want-to-extend-tax-cuts-for-wealthy-2/">Do Americans Want to Extend Tax Cuts for the Wealthy?</a>, CNN Politics, Sept. 14, 2010.  As noted in that article, another poll  (Gallup/USA Today)showed 44% want to roll back the cuts for wealthy Americans and 15% want the cuts to expire for everybody (including wealthy Americans), so also a 2-1 vote against renewing tax cuts for the wealthy. </p>
<p>And rightly so.  Because there is no way that renewing the tax cuts will be a significant stimulus to the economy nor any way that failure to renew them will hurt &#8220;small businesses&#8221;.  See, e.g., Fisher, <a href="http://www.aolnews.com/opinion/article/the-economics-of-extending-bushs-tax-cuts/19577979">The Economics of Extending Bush&#8217;s Tax Cuts</a>.  On the other hand, not renewing the cuts for the wealthy would do wonders for the economy&#8211;it would give us about $800 billion over ten years, &#8220;enough to pay for all veterans&#8217; hospitals, doctors, and the rest of the Veterans Affairs health system, plus the United States Coast Guard, plus the Food and Drug Administration, plus the operation and maintenance of every single national park for the entire 10-year period&#8211;with more than $100 billion left over.&#8221; Id (quoting Michael linden at the Center for American Progress).</p>

                                <p>From the <a target="_blank" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/20/opinion/la-oe-gruener-tax-the-rich-20100920">LA Times</a> op-ed page comes this piece by an entrepreneur:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m a venture capitalist and an entrepreneur. Over the past three decades, I&#8217;ve made both good and bad investments. I&#8217;ve created successful companies and ones that didn&#8217;t do so well. Overall, I&#8217;m proud that my investments have created jobs and led to some interesting innovations. And I&#8217;ve done well financially; I&#8217;m one of the fortunate few who are in the top echelon of American earners.</p>
<p>For nearly the last decade, I&#8217;ve paid income taxes at the lowest rates of my professional career. Before that, I paid at higher rates. And if you want the simple, honest truth, from my perspective as an entrepreneur, the fluctuation didn&#8217;t affect what I did with my money. None of my investments has ever been motivated by the rate at which I would have to pay personal income tax.</p>
<p>As history demonstrates, modest changes in the tax rate for wealthy taxpayers don&#8217;t make much of a difference if the goal is to build new companies, drive technological development and stimulate new industries. Almost a decade ago, President George W. Bush and his Republican colleagues in Congress pushed through a massive reduction in marginal tax rates, a reduction that benefitted the wealthy far more than other taxpayers.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>We were told the cuts would accelerate business growth and create jobs. Instead, we got nearly a decade of anemic job growth, stagnating wages, declining incomes and high inequality.</p>
<p>The supply-side, trickle-down economic policies of the last decade benefitted people like me, but the wealth didn&#8217;t trickle down. So while we did quite well, people who live from paycheck to paycheck didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>When inequality gets too far out of balance, as it did over the course of the last decade, the wealthy end up saving too much while members of the middle class can&#8217;t afford to spend much unless they borrow excessively. Eventually, the economy stalls for lack of demand, and we see the kind of deflationary spiral we find ourselves in now. I believe it is no coincidence that the two highest peaks in American income inequality came in 1929 and 2008, and that the following years were marked by low economic activity and significant unemployment.</p>
<p>What American businesspeople know, and have known since Henry Ford insisted that his employees be able to afford to buy the cars they made, is that a thriving economy doesn&#8217;t just need investors; it needs people who can buy the goods and services businesses create. For the overall economy to do well, everyday Americans have to do well. </p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Corporate Tax Rates and Unemployment, A Correction</strong></p>
<p>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=16">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m embarrassed.  I messed up last week&#8217;s post which appeared at <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/corporate-tax-rates-and-unemployment.html">Angry Bear</a> and on the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=162">Presimetrics blog</a>.  Essentially, I copied in some of the data on tax rates incorrect for three years in the late 1970s; the IRS source I was using was not in spreadsheet form.  The error was spotted by JzB.  To be honest, I kinda shouldn&#8217;t have written that post&#8230; it was evident even from the way I started it:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;ve been kind of swamped, low on sleep, and doing a few book related things in my few waking hours that don&#8217;t work or parenting (buy a copy of Presimetrics!!!!), so posting has been light. But I thought I&#8217;d do a quick and dirty post today about a hot topic</p></blockquote>
<p>OK.  I&#8217;ve gotten a bit more sleep (not enough, mind you, but some), and while the baby is in my care right now, he&#8217;s quiet for the time being, so let&#8217;s get this done.  First off, the topic&#8230;  I want to look a the relationship between corporate tax rates and unemployment.  Links to the data are posted below, but all the information I use, plus the analysis itself, sits in <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0AgeaSJwKy5Y-dC1WWjZPT296ZnBBbjdjUV9HMFFkcHc&#038;hl=en">this google spreadsheet</a>.</p>
<p>So, let&#8217;s begin.  </p>
<p>Figure 1 below shows the data used in this post; the top corporate marginal tax rate (obtained from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histabb.xls">IRS</a>) is on one axis and the unemployment rate for individuals sixteen years and over (from the <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/lf/aat1.txt">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a>) is on the other axis. </p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TJaboCtv3UI/AAAAAAAAAYo/Jqac1b2O-n4/s1600/redo1.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TJaboCtv3UI/AAAAAAAAAYo/Jqac1b2O-n4/s320/redo1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 1</p>
<p>Where we go from here was best explained in the last post:<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Now, consider the correlation between the top corporate marginal tax rate and the unemployment rate. If it is true that lower taxes = lower unemployment, the correlation between the two series should be positive. A positive correlation means the series should move more or less in the same direction; as tax rates rise, unemployment rises, and as tax rates fall, unemployment falls.</p>
<p>If the correlation is, in fact, negative, that means that lower unemployment tends to happen when tax rates are higher. Correlation may not be causation, but it would be very hard to argue that cutting taxes on corporations leads to lower unemployment if we do not see a positive correlation between the two series. </p>
<p>Now, obviously, it may take time for tax rates to do whatever magic they might have. So Figure 2 looks at the correlation between the top corporate marginal tax rate and the unemployment rate in the same year, the unemployment rate the next year, etc., all the way through ten years out. Its really hard to see how the effect of tax rates should last beyond a couple of years, but I figured I&#8217;d be thorough and put up the figures. I&#8217;ll take a pass at interpreting them, but feel free to reach your own conclusions.</p>
<p>Additionally, because whatever effect tax rates might have on unemployment might change over time, each correlation is computed several times: once for the entire 1948 &#8211; 2009 sample, a second time for 1960 &#8211; 2009, a third time for the period since 1970, a fourth for the period from 1980 and a fifth time for the 1990 &#8211; 2009 period. (I didn&#8217;t look at just post-2000 because the top corporate rate has been frozen during that period.)</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TJabo7nH67I/AAAAAAAAAYw/8ZEUb556uG8/s1600/redo2.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TJabo7nH67I/AAAAAAAAAYw/8ZEUb556uG8/s320/redo2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 2</p>
<p>So what do we make of this?  As I stated last week, I don&#8217;t think the outyears are all that relevant; I don&#8217;t think unemployment rates are affected by corporate tax rates ten years earlier, but I included them so no-one accuses me of cherry picking. If you think they matter, explain how in comments.  Here&#8217;s what I&#8217;m seeing in the graph:</p>
<p>1.  For the longer samples (1948 &#8211; 2009 and 1960 &#8211; 2009), the correlation between tax rates and unemployment rates is very close to zero.  <br />2.  For the three shorter time samples, the correlations are very big (positive for 1970 &#8211; 2009 and 1980 &#8211; 2009, negative for 1990 &#8211; 2009).  </p>
<p>That seems to indicate that corporate tax rates did not use to have an effect on unemployment, but in recent years, they may be never used to have an influence on jobs.  That influence may not be in the direction that tax cut proponents keep telling us about, though, as evidenced by the 1990 &#8211; 2009 series; anyone who has read Presimetrics won&#8217;t be at all surprised, as we point out the same thing in a completely different way.   I think its because over time, our economy has become more loop-hole oriented than doing things oriented.  </p>

<p>A quote from Amartya Sen, and my New Year&#8217;s Tax Resolutions (for Congress and the Obama Administration)</p>
<p>The time between December 30 and January 4 seems to be filled with lists.  Along with the ever-present list of &#8220;to dos&#8221; that haven&#8217;t been done and still are hanging around waiting for our attention, there are everyone&#8217;s &#8220;10 best&#8221; lists (e.g., the ten best movies&#8211;regretably, I don&#8217;t think I saw ten new movies in 2009, so can only say I thought Slumdog was a decent showing) or their opposite (e.g., the ten worst celebrities of the year, every one of them with Tiger Woods and Gov. Sanford firmly placed near the top).  And of course there are those New Year&#8217;s resolutions that we are supposed to deliberate over and then deliver on when the New Year rolls around&#8211;mine is to join my hubby in his morning walk and to give up doughnuts completely.</p>
<p>Not being one to gather quotes all year just for this final celebration, here&#8217;s one quote that I believe is worth thinking about as we head into the new year.  Amartya Sen writes, in &#8220;The Idea of Justice&#8221; (Belknap Press 2009), at 32:</p>
<blockquote><p>Being smarter may help the understanding not only of one&#8217;s self-interest, but also how the lives of others can be strongly affected by one&#8217;s own actions.  Proponents of so-called &#8216;Rational Choice Theory&#8217; (first proposed in economics and then enthusiastically adopted by a number of political and legal thinkers) have tried hard to make us accept the peculiar understanding that rational choice consists only in clever promotion of self-interest (which is how, oddly enough, &#8216;rational choice&#8217; is defined by the proponents of brand-named &#8216;rational choice theory&#8217;).  Nevertheless, our heads have not all been colonized by that remarkably alienating belief.  There is considerable resistance to the idea that it must be patently irrational&#8211;and stupid&#8211;to try to do anything for others except to the extent that doing good to others would enhance one&#8217;s own well-being.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />In light of Sen&#8217;s helpful clarity about the ridiculousness of &#8216;rational choice theory&#8217;, I also offer the following as the resolutions that I wish Congress and the Obama administration (and/or various administrative agencies thereof) would make (and follow through on) for this new year of 2010.</p>
<blockquote><p>1) The Treasury should resolve that it will no longer provide special dispensation to the financial institution powers that be, such as its invalid notice indicating that it would not enforce the law on loss corporations for too-big-to-fail banks, thus allowing too-big-to-fail banks to become even bigger by buying loss banks, and then allowing them to use those losses in direct contravention of the law and avoid paying income tax for years (or perhaps decades).  A similar &#8220;notice&#8221; went out recently&#8211;Notice 2010-12&#8211;stating that Treasury will continue to fail to enforce the rules under section 956 regarding what constitutes an obligation and hence relieving US shareholders of controlled foreign corporations ( many of them possibly the same too-big-to-fail banks) of further US taxpaying obligations.  (This notice continued the nonenforcement decision Treasury had made in 2008, in Notice 2008-91.  Too bad decisions do not make a good decision.)</p>
<p>2) The Supreme Court should resolve to deal with the problem of financial institutions claiming patent protection for all kinds of financial software and financial engineering &#8220;solutions&#8221; and for others claiming patent protection for tax planning strategies by releasing a decision in the Bilski case that clarifies the &#8220;abstract idea&#8221; exception.  The Court should say that no patent can be granted for innovations that merely utilize the positive laws to assert that a transaction carried out in a particular way will have a particular legal result, or for other methods of conducting transactions or of organizing human activity that do not involve the technological arts, as understood under European patent law.</p>
<p>3)  Congress should resolve to end the preferential treatment of those few Americans who own most of the financial assets of the country by ending the capital gains preference.</p>
<p>4) Congress should resolve to eliminate the preferential tax treatment of the earned income of hedge fund and equity fund managers (the so-called &#8220;carried interest&#8221;), and any other &#8220;partners&#8221; that manage partnerships and earn a share of the partnership&#8217;s gains as their compensation (such as real estate partnerships).</p>
<p>5) In order to restore some sort of balance between worker and employer, Congress should eliminate the business deduction for any compensation in excess of 20 times the average salary (about $1 million).  The cap on compensation deduction to apply to compensation in any form (stock, assets, cash), whether or not &#8220;performance related&#8221;.  </p>
<p>6) In order to treat the gifts of ordinary Americans to charities of their choice the same as the gifts of multi-millionaires to charities of their choice, Congress should repeal the special rule that permits a charitable contribution deduction for the value of stocks rather than the investment basis in the stocks.  Will that limit contributions that are made?  Perhaps, though it is clear that contributors do so for many reasons and not merely for the contribution deduction.   </p>
<p>7) Congress should resolve to resolve the estate tax situation once and for all, before some do-nothing heir-to-be decides that 2010 is the right time for the wealthy person in his life to go.  Congress should enact a modest exemption of $2 million but should make the estate tax rates progressive (beginning at2009s 45%, but moving up to at least 65% for the largest estates). </p>
<p>8) Congress should resolve to revisit the tax brackets.  We have an economy in which the average income is around $50,000, but there are individuals who make more than $500 million a year.  That spread is so large that it cannot be adequately addressed by brackets that focuse on the first $350,000 or so.  Those who make $200 million a year have incredibly more freedom of choice, and the few dollars they pay in taxes are merely peanuts compared to the precious funds from an average family.  We need to make the income tax more progressive by adding additional rate brackets&#8211;perhaps as many as 3 or 4 more.  That would still be a far cry from the income tax system before Reagan took office, when we had top rates more than double today&#8217;s top rates.  But it would address the dire fiscal need of the country in a way that is doable without creating undue suffering.</p>
<p>9) Congress and Treasury should resolve to clean up the partnership tax rules so that they do not offer such extraordinary flexibility to partners to arrange their affairs to avoid taxation&#8211;for example, by eliminating the electivity permitted to partners in many places in the rules (make the remedial method the only method allowed for taking into account book-tax disparities in contributed property) and by changing the way that partners take account of partnership debt (such as being able to get distributions of nonrecourse debt that monetize partnership property appreciation). </p>
<p>10) Congress should re-visit the rules on mergers and acquisitions, so that a tax-free merger becomes an unusual event.  Part of the problem we are facing today is that multinational corporations have grown so big that they wield enormous power globally and can sometimes appear to be able to order laws to suit them.  Witness the fact that we are well beyond the beginnings of the financial system crisis, and no single piece of legislation imposing new and better regulations on the banks have been enacted.  The size of corporations ensures that they will become as focused on raising rents for their managers as they will on making profits for shareholders, and that they will care not one whit for the ordinary American who is their customer, or their low-wage employee, or the resident of a town that they leave derelict when they move to sunnier shores.  We say that the rationale for tax-free reorganization provisions is to encourage efficient organization of corporations.  But efficiency is not God, and in fact focus on efficiency may leave democracy and fairness far behind.  We should give tax-free treatment only to shareholders who get no boot for any of their stock, and only in transactions where a high percentage of the consideration is stock (perhaps 80% or more). </p></blockquote>
