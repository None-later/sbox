<p>Barry Ritholtz argues that the problem with mortgages was underwriting standards and not securitization.  He appeals to the very great authority of Monty Python.  Click <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/02/how-can-lending-be-made-safer/?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheBigPicture+%28The+Big+Picture%29">the link</a>.</p>
<p>Ritholtz seems not to be familiar with this new idea in economic theory called &#8220;Nash equilibrium&#8221;.  Over -rated yes.  Totally irrelevant not so much.  One can not assume that underwriting standards are exogenous.  If there had been no MBS, no firm would have underwritten those mortgages.  It was exactly because it was possible to blend them, and then sell them to people who didn&#8217;t spin the mortgage tapes before buying, that the mortgages existed in the first place.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Let me work with his analogy.  First, while I have great respect for the Monty Python team, few people have been killed by canned Salmon.   Even blended into mousse, it kills fairly quickly and can be tracked back to the canner.  The way bacteria work is that if you mix some contaminated stuff with other stuff you have trouble for sure.  It doesn&#8217;t work that things seem fine until people notice.  </p>
<p>At a way lower cultural level than Ritholtz I appeal to road runner cartoons.  Wile E. Coyote runs along in mid air until he notices.  Then he falls.  As noted by everyone, this is the way financial markets really work.  The non Monty Python quality  humor is based on the fact  that gravity doesn&#8217;t really work that way.  Neither do bacteria.  Analogies between rotten mortgages and rotten Salmon fail for this reason.</p>
<p>Notably, the ingredients in the Salmon mousse are few enough that the dead diners immediately know what went wrong when death points at the mousse.  That&#8217;s not the way MBS work let alone CDOs of MBSs or CDOS of tranches of CDOS.  </p>
<p>A better analogy would be making hamburger.  Bits from hundreds of steers end up in the same package at the supermarket.  If one bit has E. coli on it, you can get sick.  If they tried to sell you that bit, you wouldn&#8217;t buy it because it would stink.  However, mixed in with hundreds of uncontaminated bits of beef, it doesn&#8217;t stink.</p>
<p>Is there a hamburger problem?  Yes there is.  One is much more likely to get food poisoning from hamburger than from unprocessed meat.  Is the solution special regulation of hamburger?  It sure is.</p>

<blockquote>However, [Dimon] cautioned, until the market meltdown &#8220;you never saw losses in these products, because home prices were going up.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>All that research in 1984 and 1990 was for naught, apparently.</p>
<p>I’m still <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2010/01/taking-short-break.html" target="_blank">away</a> (things are better, but still not completely back to normal), but this is too good not to post:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unfortunately, many default models using original LTV [Loan-to-Value] have underestimated the level of delinquencies in recent years. Measurement of the amount of equity borrowers have in their home is the chief cause. Such mismeasurement is due to two factors: declining home prices and removal of equity via second mortgages or home equity lines of credit.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this from:
<ol>
<li>2008-2010?</li>
<li>2004-2006?</li>
<li>1996?</li>
<li>officially 1996, but other textual evidence indicates it was written between 1989 and 1993?</li>
</ol>
<p>My answer is (4); the official one is (3), since it’s from the Third Edition of Frank J. Fabozzi’s <em>Bond Markets, Analysis and Strategies</em> (now in its <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bond-Markets-Analysis-Strategies-7th/dp/0136078974/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1263400474&#038;sr=1-1" target="_blank">7th edition</a>).  But if anyone out there has the first or second edition and wants to check the chapter on Mortgage Loans, I’ll give odds the paragraph is virtually identical in the Second Edition.</p>

                                <p>The WSJ collects <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/12/29/economists-react-prices-have-further-to-fall/?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed:+wsj/economics/feed+(WSJ.com:+Real+Time+Economics+Blog)&#038;utm_content=Google+Reader">reactions to the release of the latest Case-Shiller index</a>. Let&#8217;s look at two, just for fun:<br />
<blockquote>One in four mortgages are currently underwater. Foreclosure and delinquency rates, which hit a record high at the end of the third quarter of 2009, are therefore likely to continue to rise, perhaps sharply. In addition to this, the inventory of homes for sale remains near record highs. … Despite the recent positive reports on housing prices, we believe that prices have further to fall—about another 5%-10%. — Patrick Newport, IHS Global Insight&#8230;.</p>
<p>When the Case-Shiller index began increasing in the summer, there were concerns that exaggerated seasonal patterns were an important driver, as trends had briefly improved in the summer of 2008 as well. However, while some seasonality does appear to have been present, the fact that the Case-Shiller home price index is continuing to increase is good news. We still believe that home prices could fall a bit over the course of 2010, but the majority of the price adjustment has probably already occurred. — Abiel Reinhart, J.P. Morgan Chase</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not cherry-picking here.  I could make fun of the excluded &#8220;the long-awaited U.S. housing market recovery is well upon us&#8221; all day, but I&#8217;ll leave that one to <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">CR</a> (who, I now see, has already done a <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/2009/12/are-homes-now-cheap.html">Variation on the Theme</a>).</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s look at pieces of the two points, and see why I&#8217;m not sanguine (besides being long housing, that is):
<ol>
<li>One in four mortgages are currently underwater.  One in four = 25%.</li>
<li>&#8220;[W]e believe that prices have further to fall—about another 5%-10%.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;[T]he Case-Shiller home price index is continuing to increase&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Home prices could fall a bit over the course of 2010, but the majority of the price adjustment has probably already occurred.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if you take all of those at face value, you have to combine Bad Economics and Bad Policy to assume the worst is near over.</p>
<p>Details below the fold.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Bad Economics:  If 25% of households are underwater right now, it would be foolish to assume that those people would <em>or should</em> stay in their house. (<a href="http://www.interfluidity.com/v2/364.html">Steve Randy Waldman made this point a while back</a>.)</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean that all 25% of those householders should move.  There are major transaction costs in moving, not the least of which is the cost of moving itself.  Renting will not be <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB126040517376983621.html">a better deal</a> for everyone, but more and more people are going to realize that <strong>not</strong> walking away will be A Bad Idea, damaging the future of their child and themselves long after any credit report impact will have dissipated.</p>
<p>And if prices are still 5-10% above where they will be, the decision will become that much more inevitable, especially in areas where employment is lagging.</p>
<p>Looking at the &#8220;bright spot&#8221;—the counterintuitive rise in the Case-Shiller Index—which looks <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/12/29/a-look-at-case-shiller-by-metro-area-december-update/">less firm</a> than one might gather from the commenters—we see that this is another Second Derivative Problem: the pace of the decline has slowed (7.3% YOY) and the gain (&#8220;a seasonally adjusted 0.4%&#8221;) comes primarily from two areas (Phoenix, which has the largest YOY decline in the Index, and SF), with only five other positive gains over the month, none greater than 0.4% (SD; New York City is flat).</p>
<p>There are green shoots there, but they are on rather fallow ground.</p>
<p>Bad Policy is made clear in the last point: &#8220;the majority of the price adjustment has probably already occurred.&#8221;</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s assume that statement is true.  We are, therefore, slightly away from equilibrium, but probably close enough.</p>
<p>But 25% of householders are underwater.  And probably 80% of those—one in five &#8220;homeowners&#8221;—would have their economic situation improved by walking away and renting.</p>
<p>The term that comes to mind is &#8220;deadweight loss.&#8221;  And let&#8217;s look at that in the next post.</p>

                                <p>Via Greg Mitchell&#8217;s Twitter feed, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/227/story/77841.html">lying isn&#8217;t just for the IB branch any more</a>:<br />
<blockquote> Goldman declined for three years to confirm their suspicions that it had bought their mortgages from a subprime lender, even after they wrote to Goldman&#8217;s then-Chief Executive Henry Paulson — later U.S. Treasury secretary — in 2003.</p>
<p>Unable to identify a lender, the couple could neither capitalize on a mortgage hardship provision that would allow them to defer some payments, nor on a state law enabling them to offset their debt against separate, investment-related claims against Goldman.</p></blockquote>
<p>This one has something of a happy ending:<br />
<blockquote>In July, the Beckers won a David-and-Goliath struggle when Goldman subsidiary MTGLQ Investors dropped its bid to seize their house. By then, the college-educated couple had been reduced to shopping for canned goods at flea markets and selling used ceramic glass.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it required a judge who is more sane than Gretchen Morgenson of the NYT, and therefore knew to ignore false equivalencies:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;In bankruptcy court, they tried to portray us as incompetent or deadbeats,&#8221; said Celia Fabos-Becker, blinking back tears as she sat with her husband in their living room, with boxes of mortgage-related documents surrounding them&#8230;.</p>
<p>As the months dragged on, Fabos-Becker finally found a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission confirming that Goldman had bought the mortgages. Then, when a lawyer for MTGLQ showed up at a June 2007 court hearing on the stock battle, U.S. District Judge William Alsup of the Northern District of California demanded to know the firm&#8217;s relationship to Goldman, telling the attorney that he hates &#8220;spin.&#8221;</p>
<p>The lawyer acknowledged that MTGLQ was a Goldman affiliate.</p>
<p>That was an understatement. MTGLQ, a limited partnership, is a wholly owned subsidiary of Goldman that&#8217;s housed at the company&#8217;s headquarters at 85 Broad Street in New York, public records show.</p>
<p>In July, after U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Roger Efremsky of the Northern District of California threatened to impose &#8220;significant sanctions&#8221; if the firm failed to complete a promised settlement with the Beckers, Goldman dropped its claims for $626,000, far more than the couple&#8217;s original $356,000 in mortgages and $70,000 in missed payments. The firm gave the Beckers a new, 30-year mortgage at 5 percent interest.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>It’s not just reputations that are on the line. Board members, also known as directors, could be held personally liable for a bank’s demise.</p>
<p>Experts are expecting a wave of lawsuits against directors to be filed in Georgia over the next year or two as regulators and shareholders seek someone to blame — and someone to pay — for the state’s bank failures.</p>
<p>Eleven Georgia banks have failed in the past eight months, the most in the country, and experts say many more troubled institutions are in danger of being shut down.</p></blockquote>
<p>But recovery, of course, is just around the corner.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Ken Houghton&#8217;s Loyal Reader directed my attention to <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2009/04/13/what-is-the-difference-between-a-ponzi-scheme-and-an-investment-bank/">this WSJ blog entry</a>, commenting on, and attempting to provide cover for, the management and actions of The Old Firm.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sympathetic to the general argument—Ace Greenberg&#8217;s naming of Jimmy Cayne to succeed him was incredibly bad judgment that had real consequences, but not malice aforethought—but the WSJ&#8217;s attempt to defend upper management rather goes off the rails.*</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some of the analytical parts of the article:<br />
<blockquote>Investment banks were certainly imprudent in leveraging themselves 33 to 1; but they also announced it publicly in their quarterly statements.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;Certainly imprudent&#8221; is having unprotected sex with someone who clearly has open genital and/or oral herpes sores.  33x is larger even than the Cox-allowed 30x leverage (which was imprudent in the first place). &#8220;Thirty times leverage; it&#8217;s not just imprudent, it&#8217;s the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>UPDATE:  My Loyal Reader e-mails:<br />
<blockquote>Cohan writes that only at the end of a quarter was Bear around 40:1 and most of the rest of the time it was at 50 or 55:1&#8230;.JPMorgan Chase at the time of the takeover calculated that out of $300 billion Bear Stearns counted as assets, $220 billion could be considered &#8220;toxic&#8221;.</p></blockquote>
<p>So even Moore&#8217;s 33:1 is known to be optimistic. And having more than 73% of your &#8220;assets&#8221; rated as &#8220;toxic&#8221; isn&#8217;t prudent management: it&#8217;s doubling-down while <a target="blank" href="http://itmightbedangerous.blogspot.com/2008/06/draft-review-about-process.html">hitting on 17</a>.</p>
<p>We all know that the Prudent Investor definition has been redefined beyond reality, but it&#8217;s difficult to believe anyone would consider BSC&#8217;s practices to compile with reasonable Standards and Practices.<br />
<blockquote>Shareholders, in turn, never complained as long as the banks were making money in 2006 and 2007. It was only when the music stopped and the economy turned bad that shareholders started to blame the banks for shifty dealings.</p></blockquote>
<p>And it was only when Madoff admitted there were no more assets that &#8220;shareholders&#8221; complained.  Are we supposed to take some affirmative defense from this, or is Heidi Moore just clueless? (You can chose &#8220;and&#8221; if you want.)<br />
<blockquote>Meanwhile, regulators are said to still be curious about what caused the “bear raids” that took down Bear Stearns and Lehman and threatened Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs.</p></blockquote>
<p>They&#8217;re welcome to be curious, but the minute Alan Schwartz went on CNBC and said, &#8220;We think we&#8217;re solvent&#8221; is the minute anyone with any brains and capital went massively short Bear.  And they were late to the party, since anyone in the market with any brains and knowledge of MBS ramifications—think the guy at Solly who called Michael Lewis and said &#8220;Buy potatoes&#8221; as Chernobyl was happening—knew exactly who was going to be Most Likely to Pay Off if you bought (again, common knowledge) some proverbially-undervalued far OOTM put options.</p>
<p>In fairness, Cohan appears to believe this is a smoking gun.  But we&#8217;ve heard those rumours since before the bankruptcy, and Bear Stearns is not Iceland.  If Cohan&#8217;s correct in his assertion on Stewart&#8217;s show that the people who bought all those OOTM put options were hedge funds that had previously used BSC for their Clearing Agent, then they voted with their feet in the face of reality.</p>
<p>And the rest of the market isn&#8217;t dumb.  They could see who was buying, and what their previous relationship with Bear had been.  And they would see Alan Schwartz and realise this is not the man who is going to make it between the Scylla and Charybdis.  And they would take that—along with things such as Goldman&#8217;s immediate affirmation when the rumours starting about Lehmann and Bear that Lehmann would continue to be a respected competitor and trading partner—and be able to add.</p>
<p>As the Beatles said, &#8220;One and one and one is three/Got to go short Bear cause he&#8217;s so hard to see.&#8221;</p>
<p>But the WSJ wants you to think that going even beyond Christopher &#8220;I never saw a regulation I planned to enforce&#8221; Cox&#8217;s SEC-permitted leverage ratios is not a violation of the law, and that hedge funds who see incompetence and near-bankruptcy do not act on that information.</p>
<p>The coolest thing about the Stewart/Cohan interview was when Cohan said &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; and Stewart immediately came back with Schumpeter by name. Maybe this is why Heidi Moore&#8217;s piece opens by calling Stewart &#8220;our nation’s foremost financial commentator.&#8221; (Take that, Paul Krugman!)  But the attempts to argue that The Old Firm was substantively different from a Ponzi scheme are going to need a better case made than she does.</p>
<p>Capitalism deserves a better defense.</p>
<p>*They specifically miss connecting the dots on where there was clear fraud committed by management—and I suspect Cohan did as well, since no one who talks about the book seems to mention it. <strong>UPDATE</strong>: I&#8217;m now told he did deal with it, but sloughed it off. So expect <a target="blank" href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/">Yves</a> or <a target="blank" href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/">Barry</a> or <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/">Felix</a> (blogroll update candidate, btw) or <a target="blank" href="http://paul.kedrosky.com/">Paul</a> (maybe even <a target="blank" href="http://globaleconomicanalysis.blogspot.com/">Mish</a>, who has the mindset for the job)—someone who pays a lot more day-to-day attention to the market than I can right now—to jump on this one in the near future.</p>

                                <p>All (somewhat***) <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/01/links-for-2009.html">via Mark Thoma</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123069094735544743.html">Thomas Frank in the WSJ</a> tells me why I always disagree with Robert (and the Other Economists) on the role of rating agencies:<br />
<blockquote>And who makes sure that Moody&#8217;s and its competitors downgrade what deserves to be downgraded? In 1999 the obvious answer would have been: the market, with its fantastic self-regulating powers.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you look at the spreads of various debt products, you can see that the market <em>was</em> doing that type of job even in 2007.  For instance, the debt market priced [&#8220;rated&#8221;] Bear Stearns&#8217;s five-year bond issue in August 2007 at 245 over: rather closer to &#8220;junk&#8221; status than its rating would have implied. If you compare the debt and stock markets, it&#8217;s easy to see which is closer to &#8220;rating.&#8221; Unfortunately, the area where information is more valuable* is not the one discussed and understood in the press, where BSC kept trading up for several more months.</p>
<p>If a market &#8220;regulates&#8221; but no one notices, does it make the WSJ?</p>
<p>Brad Setser <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/2008/12/31/relitigating-1998-at-the-end-of-2008/">finishes the destruction</a> of Tyler Cowen&#8217;s LTCM &#8220;argument&#8221; begun by Buce, while revealing its underbelly:<br />
<blockquote>The big banks called to the New York Fed were the creditors of LTCM and they were in some sense “bailed-in.” To avoid taking losses on the credit that they had extended to LTCM, they had to pony up and recapitalize LTCM. [footnoted exception for BSC]</p>
<p>It just so happened that the market recovered and it was possible for LTCM to exit many of its positions without taking large losses, or in some cases any losses. The banks that took control of LTCM when LTCM was on the ropes were able to unwind LTCM’s portfolio in a way that didn’t result in additional losses. But the result Cowen desired — large losses for the banks and broker-dealers who provided credit to LTCM – was quite possible if LTCM’s assets weren’t sufficient to cover all its liabilities. No creditor of LTCM was able to get rid of its exposure as a result of the Fed’s actions. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>It used to be a standard rule that if you wanted to bury something in a newspaper, you published it on a Friday, or the day before a holiday.  This seems to be what the NYT is doing with Casey Mulligan (previously discussed here here), who dropped the other shoe yesterday and was, amazingly, worse than expected.  PGL at Econospeak <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/12/chicago-economist-claims-homeowners.html">does the read and calls out the deed</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Mulligan is essentially saying that those poor saps who have lost their jobs actually quit so they can game the mortgage system. In other words, there is no such thing as involuntary unemployment or being forced to either lose one’s home versus enter into one of these mortgage modification programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>As noted <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/20/AR2008122000076_pf.html">in the WaPo two weeks ago</a> (via Stan Collender at Capital Gains and Games),** qualifying for the &#8220;mortgage modification&#8221; program (i.e., reducing the principal on your loan to not more than 90% of the current market value) <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/696/mortgage-politics-when-will-homeowners-realize-they-do-indeed-have-some-resp">is an onerous task</a>:<br />
<blockquote>He was hoping he could qualify for the federal government&#8217;s Hope for Homeowners program, which allows the Federal Housing Administration to insure a new mortgage if the lender voluntarily writes down the mortgage principal to 90 percent of the new value of the home. But when he asked his bank about that, he was told he would have to be on the brink of foreclosure or have an adjustable-rate mortgage.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Mulligan is basically blaming (1) those whose ability to keep their home depended on keeping their job and (2) those who took Alan Greenspan&#8217;s venal advice to go into ARMs just at the point at which he started raising rates.  Class act.</p>
<p>And, finally, lest you think I&#8217;m always bashing Tyler Cowen, he notes <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/12/chess-is-a-youn.html">a phenomenon in chess</a> and suggests a reasonable conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>I also see a general principle operating: the more exact a &#8220;science&#8221; the game becomes, the smaller is the value of accumulated experience relative to sheer skill.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sheer is dicey, but the identification of the shift in proportionality may be accurate, and probably has applications in economics as well.</p>
<p>*The debt market is less liquid and therefore considers information more valuable. This is effectively the corollary of the <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/12/momentum-trading.html">DeLong, Shliefer, Summers and Waldmann papers</a>: if you can&#8217;t depend on momentum trading, you take more care not to be the &#8220;greater fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>**Yes, I saw the Collender-bashing in my previous post.  I&#8217;ve said before that CG&#038;G became significantly less readable after the election, and am foolishly optimistic enough to believe that they may be returning to rationality. Besides, he happened to be correct: any given from increased military spending is definitionally no better (and likely worse) than spending the same amount on public infrastructure.</p>
<p>***I read PGL&#8217;s piece before seeing it in the links, but they&#8217;re all there.</p>

<blockquote>I know we&#8217;re in crazy economic times here, but it&#8217;s still a bit weird seeing economists suggesting that our government get into the mortgage business at below market rates.</p></blockquote>
<p>I say the economic times are so crazy that I&#8217;ll worry about getting a refi at &#8220;below market&#8221; rates when the market shows some signs of sanity.</p>
<p>The last time I was in the mortgage market, in late-2004, I obtained a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage at an interest rate approximately 1.6 percentage points over the 10-year Treasury bond yield at the time; that&#8217;s exactly what Hubbard and Mayer consider a normally-functioning-market spread in the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122948162452913103.html">W$J op-ed</a> that <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CalculatedRisk/~3/2vv__DFf_JI/bad-housing-policy-proposals-never-die.html">CR takes on today</a>.  The same spread today would imply a rate of 3.8 percent!  Now maybe a lender today would require a &#8220;world going to hell in a handbasket&#8221; premium.  Fair enough.  But as Hubbard and Mayer observe, that could be 70 bp and that would put us at this magical 4.5 percent.  Just how much riskier <i>are</i> full-doc conforming prime mortgages?  </p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m not keen on re-inflating the bubble per se, or creating a right to a 4.5 percent mortgage.  But under the circumstances, there seem to be worse things that Uncle Sam (or Uncle Ben) can do than to lend money at normal-ish spreads on otherwise prudent terms — the &#8220;prudent&#8221; part being a missing element of a lot of bubble-era lending, of course.</p>
