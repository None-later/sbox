<p>Via Steve Benen <br />
<blockquote>the folks <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/01/17/what_are_republicans_learning_at_their_retreat_anyway.html">who&#8217;ll appear</a> on the panel about &#8220;successful communication with minorities and women,&#8221; and the criticism here seems far more reasonable.    <br />
<blockquote>[The session will have] a female moderator (Rachel Campos-Duffy), a female consultant (Ana Navarro), a female congressman (Rep. Jaime Herrera Buetler), and three congressmen who are neither female nor minorities: Rep. Adam Kinzinger, Rep. Scott Rigell, and Rep. Frank Wolf.</p></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I will pass over the gender confusion of &#8220;female congressman&#8221; and note that  the congressperson in question is Rep. Jaime Herrera B<strong>eu</strong>tler ( <a href="http://herrerabeutler.house.gov/s">http://herrerabeutler.house.gov/s</a> who is not named Jaime Herrera B<strong>ue</strong>tler.  Inability to spell Spanish surnames does not contribute to  &#8220;successful communication with minorities &#8230;&#8221; .  Oooooops<br />via <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2013/01/17/1179881/-GOP-retreat-roundup-Lessons-in-what-not-to-say" target=":_blank">Hunter at dailykos</a><br />In the unlikely event that they get hammered again in 2014, they can say &#8220;the &#8216;Buetler&#8217; did it&#8221;.</p>
