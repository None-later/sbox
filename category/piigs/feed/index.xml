				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Guardian <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/feb/07/bond-market-greece-pigs">on the PIIGS</a>:<br />
<blockquote>By the time Black Wednesday was over in September 1992, Soros had reputedly pocketed £1bn and the reputation of the government of John Major for economic competence was in tatters.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, datacharmer at Bluematter <a href="http://bluematter.blogspot.com/2010/02/message-to-all-piigs-shorters-out-there.html">gets to the core of the matter</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I&#8217;m wondering what the shorters&#8217; game is. As I said before, there is no real possibility of default in an EMU country. In fact, the very notion of an EMU country folding with 120% or even 150% debt to GDP ratio is laughable, not only because it&#8217;s very, very easy to fix the situation (the PIIGS governments announce a 5% cut in public sector pay, or a rise of 2% in VAT) but also because healthier EMU countries have a lot to lose by letting the PIIGS go down, both politically and economically. Worst case scenario, Germany says &#8216;enough&#8217;, and the whole thing just blows over.</p></blockquote>
<p>Playing Moral Hazard games when the House has an unlimited bankroll is for fools.</p>
