				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Just a little point of order regarding how bad this economy is.</p>
<p>Lost in Space  120 episodes, 33.2 per season<br />Batman (on twice weekly) 120 episodes, 53.33 per season<br />The Virginian, 249 episodes, 27.67 per season<br />The Beverly Hillbillies, 274 episodes, 30 per season<br />Gilligan&#8217;s Island, 98 episodes, 32.67 per season</p>
<p>New season started this year around September 22.  Last Monday night (10/27/08), CBS sitcom night, my date night with my flower girl&#8230; every one of the shows was a repeat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s bad enough we get 7 minutes of commercials all timed to the other networks, but now they can&#8217;t even get to Halloween before running out of new shows!  </p>
<p>We&#8217;re entering a depression, and we can&#8217;t get new comedy?  Guess I&#8217;ll just have to rely on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3s8sEYzHWQ">real thing</a>.  All 190 of them.</p>
<p>On no!  They&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7txeOlujTc&#038;feature=related">co-oped</a>.</p>
<p>There is only one solution.  We must all immediately call our congress critters and the presidential candidates and demand a bailout for the sitcom industry!  It is our only salvation, our only true hope. It is what worked in the <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/comedy/historicalcontext.html">past regarding</a> our sanity and stopped us from becoming like the bankers we loath.</p>
