				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve been working on White Paper on Liquidity and the idea of a &#8220;market,&#8221; and plan to post some pieces of it here over the next week or so.</p>
<p>But this is too good to pass up, and I&#8217;m late to the game as is.</p>
<p>On 15 September, the CFTC and the SEC held a joint &#8220;public roundtable discussion&#8221; on Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs).  Part 1 is <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/openmeetings/2010/jac091510-panel1.asx">here</a>, Part 2 <a href="http://www.sec.gov/news/openmeetings/2010/jac091510-panel2.asx">here</a>.</p>
<p>What is most amazing, if you didn&#8217;t pay attention to the markets, is how few actual transactions occur in the &#8220;derivatives market&#8221;—at least according to people who work in the Industry and are discussants.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the Credit Swaps Market. According to ISDA, the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?sid=a4AtVMqwawtc&#038;pid=newsarchive">Credit Default Swaps Market in 2009 declined to $38.6 trillion</a>; that&#8217;s $38,600,000,000,000, give or take forty or fifty billion.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Sounds like a lot, no? Strangely, there&#8217;s virtually no liquidity associated with that $38.6T. According to the testimony in Part 1, the most frequently traded CDS—GE, presumably because they bring good things to life (or at least have DoD contracts)—trades around 15 times a day.  That might be impressive for a penny stock, but it&#8217;s not exactly the type of thing that makes you think &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s a market!&#8221;</p>
<p>The implications are clear: the bid-offer will be wide (think FX rates from your local bank, or gold prices from <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/2010/07/glenn-beck-goldline/">Goldline</a>), the loss when one tries to get out of the trade makes &#8220;driving a new car off the lot&#8221; look like a blip, and any dispute will be resolved against your favor.</p>
<p>In short, there is—and should be—very little retail demand for these products, for very good reason.  Paul Volcker&#8217;s description of <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/marketbeat/2009/12/08/volcker-praises-the-atm-blasts-finance-execs-experts/">the ATM as the only financial innovation in the past 25 years that helped people</a> has never seemed so true.</p>
