				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Floyd Norris lists <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/16/winners-and-losers/">the Unlucky 13</a>, a.k.a., my portfolio.*</p>
<p>Ignoring AIG (of which more later, maybe), here are the top Market Cap losers in the S&#038;P 500 YTD, who combined have dropped by more than half a trillion dollars:
<ol>
<li>EXXON MOBIL</li>
<li>GENERAL ELECTRIC</li>
<li>MICROSOFT</li>
<li>AT&#038;T</li>
<li>CITIGROUP</li>
<li>BANK OF AMERICA</li>
</ol>
<p>After reading that list, I fully except to see Declan MacManus, in his guise as <a href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0078766/">The Earl of Manchester</a>, and am starting to wonder when McCain/Palin will adopt &#8220;I am not a schmuck&#8221; as its official campaign slogan.</p>
<p>*Well, not exactly mine.  I&#8217;ve been 85-90% in cash since Q4 2007.  Can you say risk averse?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In honor of <a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/07/just-saw-no-to-crack.html">this post</a> (from another blog whose political posts I&#8217;ve stopped reading; Hilzoy is in good company*), I have decided today to shave off my beard and mustache.**</p>
<p>After all, David (&#8220;Axis of Evil&#8221;) Frum is always right, as John Holbo <a href="http://examinedlife.typepad.com/johnbelle/2003/11/dead_right.html">originally documented</a>:<br />
<blockquote>This sentiment or intuition or feeling (whatever you call it) produces a strangely hypertrophic concern with what seem (to me anyway) like rather ornamental details:</p>
<p>&#8220;If I am bearded, and I notice that my boss and the last four men in my section to win promotion are clean-shaven, I will find myself slowly nudged toward the barbershop.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>which led to:<br />
<blockquote>Frum: Just think about it. Our economy depends on a healthy culture.</p>
<p>BG: But you don&#8217;t even care about the economy. You said you don’&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Frum: I wish you hadn&#8217;t mentioned that.</p>
<p>BG: But I did.</p>
<p>Frum: Look, if you shave the beard, everything will be better.</p>
<p>BG: You&#8217;’re a moonbat.</p>
<p>Frum: It’&#8217;s all related to foreign policy and wheelchair access in public school, in ways that would take a long time to explain.</p></blockquote>
<p>*<a href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2008/07/test.html">Exception noted</a>.</p>
<p>**This, of course, has nothing whatsoever to do with a much higher proportion of white hairs being prominently displayed in those two parts of the hair.</p>
