				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Everyone should read Joe Wilcox&#8217;s update, based on the release of more court docs, on the ongoing saga of Why Vista Sucked on Release.  (Short version: because Intel asked.)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/corporate/intel-microsoft_vistagate_part_3.html?kc=MWRSS02129TX1K0000535">Teaser quote</a>, which would look fine in Mankiw or Krugman&#8217;s next Macro text:</p>
<blockquote><p>Based on the available information, I come to an easy conclusion: One monopoly colluded with another for economic gain—and in this instance causing harm to Microsoft, its partners and customers. Matters were even worse than intended, because Microsoft delayed Vista: </p>
<ol>
<li>Vista-inferior chip sets stayed in market longer than they otherwise should have. </li>
<li>More consumers bought PCs incapable of fully running Aero Glass.</li>
<li>Notebooks were disproportionately affected, because the state of the art was even lower than for desktops.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So if the guys at Compaq wonder why I will never buy one of their products again, they may have a legitimate argument that it wasn&#8217;t <em>all</em> their fault.  But it doesn&#8217;t change the reality—or, if you prefer, the Externality.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Update:  rdan makes big mistake on static news.</p>
<p><a href="http://static-news.com/">Static News</a> by Wm Hallowell is a new site and is aimed at the age 13-30 year old group.  It is my impression this younger group is generally not a part of our regular readership, with a few notable exceptions.</p>
<p>Angry Bear is listed with some of the Big Guys on the leftie side of the bloglists.  The younger group is mostly who I deal with in other parts of my life, so I was glad to see this happening.  How we might respond to a younger group is unclear to me (well, way younger perhaps) but I find it intriguing.</p>
<p>When I hear even the young side of boomers worry about Soc. Sec. not &#8216;being there&#8217; for them, but then start to explain the math and such, they now simply laugh and run away (affectionately, but with no qualms).</p>
<p>I will be hoping to explore the links (and design if changes are made in consequence) at some point with our group of eleven and of course readers.  Maybe for now bedtime reading can be switched to laptops and spencer&#8217;s pictures?</p>
