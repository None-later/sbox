<p>Economist <a href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=31&#038;Itemid=74&#038;jumival=9721" target="_blank">Robert Pollin</a>, Professor of Economics at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst and founding co-Director of the Political Economy Research Institute <a href="http://www.peri.umass.edu/" target="_blank">(PERI)</a>, has a series on wages/employment and the minimum wage via Real News Network (they provide transcripts) <a target="_blank" href="http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&#038;task=view&#038;id=33&#038;Itemid=74&#038;jumival=623">here</a></p>
<p>Professor Richard Burkhauser has commented on President Obama&#8217;s call to raise the minimum wage to $9 an hour. And here&#8217;s what Burkhauser had to say:</p>
<p>President Obama&#8217;s call for an increase in the minimum wage to reduce poverty flies in the face of 30 years of evidence from Card and Krueger to Newmark and Washer that increases in the minimum wage have no effect on poverty rates.<br />Bob, the argument that Burkhauser gives is that most people working at minimum-wage jobs are not heads of families, they&#8217;re younger people in families that already have income earners, and that if you raise the minimum wage, it&#8217;s going to reduce the number of jobs available for young people who are mostly in these minimum-wage jobs and really do nothing about poverty levels, because the main bread-earners are already earning more than the minimum wage, he argues. He says that&#8217;s the evidence for 30 years. What do you make of that?</p>
<p>POLLIN: Well, that&#8217;s not the evidence that I&#8217;m familiar with. The evidence that I&#8217;m familiar with, having studied living-wage proposals, minimum-wage proposals around the country at state levels, at municipal levels, and national levels, the evidence is the overwhelming majority of people who are at or near minimum-wage levels of wages are not teenagers—let&#8217;s put it that way. They&#8217;re—the median age is roughly in the 30s. Most of the people have been at their job or at similar jobs for over a decade. They are on their long-term employment trajectory; they&#8217;re not about to jump up to some middle-income job as soon as they get out of college.<br />That doesn&#8217;t mean that there aren&#8217;t teenagers. The number of teenagers in the labor force are disproportionately at or near minimum-wage jobs. But the majority of people at or near minimum wages are not teenagers.</p>
<p>Now, there is another point. There are many cases in which teenagers or young people who are working at or near minimum-wage jobs are part of families that are above the poverty line, and some of my own research has shown that in fact the contribution of the teenager is what significantly helps to bring the family above the poverty line&#8230;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
<div dir="ltr">Yesterday, both sides drew their battle lines in the coming war over the minimum wage. After Obama called for a minimum wage hike in his State of the Union speech, House Republicans dug in against it, casting their opposition as grounded in concern for the plight of low wage workers. John Boehner <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entry/boehner-shoots-down-obamas-minimum-wage-hike">asked</a>: “Why would we want to make it harder for small employers to hire people?”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/02/14/the-morning-plum-dems-to-use-minimum-wage-against-gop-in-2014/">Dems to use minimum wage against GOP in 2014</a>, Greg Sargent, Washington Post, this morning</div>
<p>To me, one of the great frustrations in Obama’s failure during most of his first term to communicate, effectively or at all, the basic premises of Keynesian and other liberal economics-related arguments (including on healthcare) was his apparent resistance to mentioning&#8211;early, often, or ever&#8211;specific other countries’ successes or failures that illustrate the point. </p>
<p>But there’s no time like the present for him and the congressional Dems to start to do do this, by maybe mentioning these facts: that Australia’s minimum wage is $15 U.S. and that its unemployment rate is 5.4%, and that the United States has (surprise!) the largest gap between the minimum wage and the median wage of any advanced economy in the world.</p>
<p>I learned those facts yesterday when I read Washington Post columnist <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-raise-the-minimum-wage/2013/02/06/34857264-7066-11e2-8b8d-e0b59a1b8e2a_story.html">Matthew Miller’s Feb. 6 column</a>.  He mentioned it and linked to it in <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-obamas-hollow-speech/2013/02/13/d928c944-75a5-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_story.html">his column yesterday</a> about Obama’s State of the Union address.  In yesterday’s column, he suggested seemingly, facetiously, that it was his February 6 column that had persuaded Obama to include a minimum-wage-hike proposal in his address.  But after reading the earlier column, I suspect that it was not only what convinced Obama to make the call but also was what caused Obama to even think of it.  </p>
<p>Both of Miller’s columns say that the $9/hr. figure that Obama proposed in his speech would still leave the minimum wage at $1.68 below what the value of the minimum wage was in 1968.  The first column, Miller also mentions that several CEOs of large corporations support a rise in the minimum wage and that a prominent conservative, the editor of American Conservative magazine, suggests raising the minimum wage to $12/hr.  Of course, the Republicans will showcase their own CEOs, and some small-business owners, to support their own position.</p>
<p>Which is where Australia comes in.  Or at least where invoking it should come in. The special beauty of using Australia as an example&#8211;whether in support of an increase in the minimum wage or in refuting the Obamacare-is-socialism/makers-vs.-takers mantra&#8211;is that few Americans associate Australia with, um, socialism.  They associate it instead with free-enterprise economics and a high standard of living.  And soon, hopefully, also with a higher minimum wage that corresponds to a low unemployment rate.  </p>
<p>Maybe Marco Rubio and John Boehner could get a travel discount <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/02/marco-rubio-needs-to-travel-more.html">if they booked their reservations</a> together. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Black Friday around here in New England begins to night in stores about 8 P.M.  On the internet Black Friday&#8217;s discounts began last week as the competition heats up between companies with stores and internet based sales. Stores have responded with aggressive discounts, especially visible is Walmart.</p>
<p>This post is relevant to the issue of wages at Walmart, and points to deeper economic issues one has to keep in mind when reading about the economics overall versus a company policy.  This becomes especially poignant as some Walmart workers attempt to draw attention to wages, benefits, and hours the company paints as necessary.</p>
<p>Demos has some figures for thought in <a href="http://www.demos.org/publication/retails-hidden-potential-how-raising-wages-would-benefit-workers-industry-and-overall-ec" target="_blank">How Raising Wages Would Benefit Workers, the Industry and the Overall Economy</a>.   Here&#8217;s a summary of the study from <i>Demos</i>:</p>
<blockquote><p>This study assumes a new wage floor for the lowest-paid retail workers equivalent to $25,000 per year for a full-time, year-round retail worker at the nation&#8217;s largest retail companies, those employing at least 1,000 workers.  For the typical worker earning less than this threshold, the new floor would mean a 27 percent pay raise.  Including both the direct effects of the wage raise and spillover effects, the new floor will impact more than 5 million retail workers and their families. This study examines the impact of the new wage floor on economic growth and job creation, on consumers in terms of prices, on companies in terms of profit and sales, and for retail workers in terms of their purchasing power and poverty status.</p>
<p>“There is a flaw in the conventional thinking that profits, low prices and decent wages cannot co-exist,” says Catherine Ruetschlin, study author and Demos Policy Analyst. “The findings in the study prove the country’s largest retailers are in an ideal position to launch a private sector stimulus, leading the way towards a new model for American prosperity.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://robertreich.org/post/36219730368" target="_blank">Robert Reich</a> offers his viewpoint below the fold:</p>
<blockquote><p>Most new jobs in America are in personal services like retail, with low pay and bad hours. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the average full-time retail worker earns between $18,000 and $21,000 per year.</p>
<p>But if retail workers got a raise, would consumers have to pay higher prices to make up for it? A new study by the think tank Demos reports that raising the salary of all full-time workers at large retailers to $25,000 per year would lift more than 700,000 people out of poverty, at a cost of only a 1 percent price increase for customers.</p>
<p>And, in the end, retailers would benefit. According to the study, the cost of the wage increases to major retailers would be $20.8 billion — about one percent of the sector’s $2.17 trillion in total annual sales. But the study also estimates the increased purchasing power of lower-wage workers as a result of the pay raises would generate $4 billion to $5 billion in additional retail sales.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a></p>
<p><strong>Unfounded Obsession With the Greek Minimum Wage</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_07/02/2012_426483">Greek minimum wage</a> is apparently a point of contention between the Troika (ECB/EU/IMF) and the Greek government. T<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/world/europe/papademos-greek-premier-is-tested-in-impasse-with-lenders.html">he NY Times</a> cites competitiveness gains as a rationale for the minimum wage cut:<br />
<blockquote><em><strong>The goal of any pay cuts would be to help make Greek workers, who are generally less productive than workers elsewhere in Europe, </strong>able to compete more effectively inside the euro zone, where countries share a common currency that does not allow devaluations to help even out differences in labor costs.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Huh? See below. The going line seems to be that the Greeks are lazy. They earn minimum government-negotiated wages without actually doing a whole lot because they’re uncompetitive. This is wrong; the data do not support this view.<br />First, the Greek people aren’t lazy at all. <em>In fact, Greek workers spent more hours working 2010 (in annual hours actually worked per worker) than those </em>in Chile, Hungary, Czech Republic, Poland, Estonia, Turkey, Mexico, Slovak Republic, Italy, the US, New Zealand, Japan, Portugal, Canada, Finland, Iceland, Australia, Ireland, Slovenia, Spain, the UK, Sweden, Luxembourg, Austria, Belgium, Germany, Norway, and the Netherlands – <em>and in that order</em>. (You can <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/27/48622469.xls">download and view the data</a> from the OECD 2011 Employment Outlook.) <a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2012/01/greek-german-work-hours-compared.html">Marc Chandler also highlighted </a>this fact back in January.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Sure, one could argue that the Greek workers work a lot of hours, but it’s for less output. Furthermore, labor costs have risen substantially relative to other Euro area countries, so the country’s worse off. That’s the uncompetitiveness route. If you care about productivity and relative wage gains, why not look at the drop in Greece’s relative unit labor costs?<br />The chart below illustrates the average accumulated gain/loss <em>in nominal labor costs (labor costs per hour)</em> across the EA 12 in the run-up to the crisis, 2005-2008, and then since the recession, 2009-Q32011 (Finland data unavailable). By this measure, Greece is certainly doing what the Troika want of it: relative devaluation in nominal labor costs. Since 2009, Greek labor costs have fallen 5.3%.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/ulc_chart3.jpg"><img alt="" height="500" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/ulc_chart3.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p>(<em>Note: <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database#">the data </a>are constructed as the percentage gain/loss of the average 2008 quarterly labor costs over the average of 2005 labor costs versus the average of Q4 2010 to Q3 2011 labor costs over the average 2009 quarterly labor costs, all working-day adjusted.</em>)</p>
<p>French and Austrian labor costs appreciated 12% and 10.7%, respectively, spanning 2005-2008, and another 5.7% and 4.0%, respectively, since 2009. In Ireland, the 1.8% average reduction in labor costs since 2009 pales in comparison to the 2005-2008 14.7% surge. Greece saw a lower accumulated gain in labor costs spanning 2005-2008 than most countries and cut labor costs since 2009. The ‘wage’ cost anger towards Greece seems to be misdirected.</p>
<p>Now I’m really wondering what is this obsession with the Greek minimum wage? True, the Greek minimum wage did rise 0.8% spanning 2010-2011 (you can <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database#">see Eurostat data here</a>). However, as a proportion of average monthly earnings, the 2010 minimum wage in Greece is roughly in line with other program countries, Ireland and Portugal, and lower than that in France, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Only in 2011 do Greece’s policies stick out when monthly minimum wage as a proportion of average monthly earnings surged to 50.1%. However, simple calculations demonstrate that for Greece the higher 2011 ratio of minimum wage to average monthly earnings was largely a function of falling average monthly earnings, -18.7%, rather than the rise in the minimum wage, +0.8%.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/min_wage_chart.jpg"><img alt="" height="500" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/02/min_wage_chart.jpg" width="600"></a></p>
<p>Perhaps I am not understanding things clearly here – I am sure that you all will correct me if I am not – but what’s this obsession with minimum wages? It looks to me like the fiscal austerity driven recession is indeed resulting in a reduction in Greece’s relative labor costs irrespective of minimum wage policy. Isn’t that the point?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Politicians tasked with convincing democratic majorities that they should oppose minimum wage increases generally fall back on the economic argument that such increases simply lead to job losses. Often they go on to point out that these losses fall disproportionately on the young, the unskilled, or minorities. Before examining whether this argument is in fact true at all and whether this effect is sufficient to cause us to vote against our own personal material interest it is worth asking if the argument is being offered in good faith.</p>
<p>A look at the bigger pictures suggests the answer is no. Because these same politicians seem indifferent to these populations in almost all other contexts. For example it is common for these same conservative politicians to claim that we should give tax breaks to companies to get them to relocate no matter that the job effects on the previous factory location might be serious. Now suddenly it is all about the jobs locally. Moreover when given the opportunity to fund education, job training, youth job programs, and community development, programs which might or might not be stimulative in the short run, but certain would create longer term opportunities for these same populations the Republicans in both Houses voted almost unanimously &#8216;No&#8217;. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/02/gop.stimulus.worries/index.html">What GOP Leaders deem wasteful in Senate stimulus bill</a></p>
<p>So when you see arguments framed as follows: &#8220;How can you workers be so cold as to take a wage increase when you know it is going to cause poor Jimmy the Stock Boy to lose his job?&#8221; workers and voters should immediately be smelling a rat. Because what we do know is that if management decided it was more efficient to move from a system of supplies kept on site to an on demand system via some company like Corporate Express that Jimmy would be on his ass on the pavement in an instant. These appeals in economic guise are simply attempts to appeal to liberal guilt and worker solidarity to convince us to vote against our own interest in favor of the corporate bottom line.</p>
<p>Plus it doesn&#8217;t take a lot of complicated analysis to show that the argument can&#8217;t just rest on changes on employment at the margin, just a pencil and a calculator. Take a company with 100 workers including Jimmy  making federal minimum wage currently at $6.55 per hour. This wage is scheduled to increase to $7.25 per hour on July 24th. Let&#8217;s say that management in order to partially compensate for this increased cost decided to lay off Jimmy. Should the other workers care enough that they should forgo the pay increase? For that matter should Jimmy even want them to? I suggest the answer to both questions is no.</p>
<p>We have 99 workers now making an extra 70 cents an hour which multiplies out to an extra $69.30 per hour. When we subtract out Jimmy&#8217;s wage that net drops to $62.75. Which is plenty enough to buy Jimmy a nice lunch on his last day. More to the point it is enough to subsidize Jimmy&#8217;s unemployment until he gets a new job. A job where he too will be getting $7.25.</p>
<p>Meaning that when economists like Bryan Caplan insist that workers who don&#8217;t understand that minimum wages are net negative for workers are irrational to the extent that they shouldn&#8217;t be allowed to vote (as advocated in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Myth-Rational-Voter-Democracies-Policies/dp/0691129428">Myth of the Rational Voter</a>) he can kiss my something or other. The question is just not as easy as saying &#8216;cost increases so demand falls&#8217; as being just self-evident. Because the system and the calculation is more complex than that. As an example I pointed out on Spencer&#8217;s post <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/minimum-wage-disinformation.html">Minimum Wage Disinformation</a> that there is a more or less constant demand for Big Macs and Pizza delivery, meaning that McDonalds and Domino&#8217;s have to staff up or just abandon the market. And that is mostly not going to happen, there is money to be made selling burgers and pizza. There may be price effects (though the chains generally like price uniformity and demand it in response to promotional offers advertised nationally), there might alternately be profit effects. Or maybe the bosses stop letting the employees getting discounts. The idea that this instead simply and always reduces to a cost/demand identity for jobs is nonsense.</p>
<p>What would an honest argument to convince workers they should vote for politicians so as to be protected from the horror of getting paid a little more an hour look like? Follow me below the fold.</p>
<p>Well first it would have to address the question of self-interest. I doubt that any right leaning economist would argue that it is not just a right but almost a duty to maximize your own self-interest in market transactions. Indeed that is kind of the driving principle of markets. Moreover I think most would argue that maximizing your family&#8217;s self-interest is an equally valid goal. Moreover that goal can stay valid even as the circles get wider: co-workers, average town income, average state income, average national income, even average world income. The only question is how much should you give up in exchange for the welfare of others as the circles get bigger</p>
<p>The standard argument against minimum wage is &#8216;Everything&#8217;. Don&#8217;t take a wage increase that is clearly in your own self interest because it might cost Jimmy a job. Or maybe the job of the last kid hired at Luigi&#8217;s Pizza downtown. Or maybe the job of some high-school dropout in Michigan. Sorry capitalists never seem to use this same logic on their own economic decisions, nope instead they want to maximize return and cut taxation levels regardless of its effects on the price of maize in Africa.</p>
<p>Are there circumstances where workers should buy in to this argument? Well I think so. Depending on where you draw your own personal circle if a wage increase causes a net decrease in income then you might consider forgoing it. For example if Jimmy was not just a co-worker but also a son contributing to family income you might pause. On the other hand if job prospects are reasonably good locally and Jimmy can get a new higher wage job in short period of time then I think you grab the increase. Similarly if you are working in a service industry and the wage increase causes the local manufacturing plant to shut down and so devastate the town&#8217;s economy you might think hard. But outside the agricultural processing sector I wouldn&#8217;t think that the general manufacturing wage was that close to minimum wage to start with. And unless there are barriers to mobility you always have the option to move to places that still have job opportunities.</p>
<p>When seems to suggest that the task for economists who claim that opposing minimum wage is such blindingly obvious policy to anyone rational is that they need to show that the net effect of such increases have such devastating income effects on the entire state, region, or nation that workers as a whole are in a structurally negative situation. It is not enough to show some minor correlation between minimum wage increases and teen unemployment. If such an increase helps me pay my rent and still leaves me availability to Big Macs and Pizza why should I rationally care that some resort somewhere has to cut back on housekeeping staff.</p>
<p>On my reading the whole thing reduces to exploiting Liberal Guilt for corporate profit. Bosses are not doing you a favor in keeping your wages suppressed. That argument on examination is threadbare.</p>
