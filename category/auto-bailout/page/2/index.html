                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s time to reread the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html">World Bank report</a> on what creates wealth because it seems that the arguments against the stimulus are from a mind-set of very narrow thinking about what creates wealth.  They all seem focused on what the World Bank report calls “Produced Capital”.   Unfortunately, focusing on just that aspect of capital reduces our nation to growth based on 18% of our economic power.  And, as far as I have understood the arguments for tax cuts, they are based on effecting this small aspect of what produces wealth in a developed economy like ours.  <br />
<blockquote>“The rest of the story is intangible capital. <strong>That encompasses raw labor; human capital, which includes the sum of a population&#8217;s knowledge and skills; and the level of trust in a society and the quality of its formal and informal institutions.</strong> Worldwide, the study finds, &#8220;natural capital accounts for 5 percent of total wealth, produced capital for 18 percent, and intangible capital 77 percent.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>You know what that is?  Democratic traditional spending priorities.  <br />
<blockquote>“Rich countries are largely rich because of the skills of their populations and the quality of the institutions supporting economic activity,&#8221; the study concludes. According to Hamilton&#8217;s figures, the rule of law explains 57 percent of countries&#8217; intangible capital. Education accounts for 36 percent.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Get that?  It means tax cuts are just stupid policy if the goal is to stimulate a developed economy as strongly as possible such that the stimulus creates lasting wealth.  Is that not the complaint by the republicans and blue dogs, the lack of lasting wealth which means jobs as the stimulus is written?  What the World Bank report means is, if you want the biggest bang for your greenback, you have to weigh the heavy side of the stimulus to  invest in <em>“human capital, which includes the sum of a population&#8217;s knowledge and skills; and the level of trust in a society and the quality of its formal and informal institutions.”  </em></p>
<p>You have to load the stimulus to the 77% side and not the 23% side (natural 5% and produced capital 18%).   That is 3.4 human capital to 1 natural/produced capital.   That means education (all forms and subjects), support for the economically disadvantaged (welfare, medicaid), health care (medicare, national health payment reform, system IT), risk prevention and recovery (law, fire/rescue, FEMA), science (greening energy, environment)  and the arts (art districts, museums) to suggest a few. </p>
<p>Beyond that, the intentional campaign to sway public opinion by purposefully lying about the way a stimulus such as is being proposed will function, is to actually predestine our efforts to failure. The reason is because the campaign is producing a lack of trust.<br />
<blockquote>“An economy with a very efficient judicial system, clear and enforceable property rights, and an effective <strong>and uncorrupt government will produce higher total wealth</strong>.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As noted above, the level of trust in a society of its institutions is of issue regarding the level of capital available to produce wealth.   The greatest harm that is coming from the republican&#8217;s drive to instill their minority will on the many out of selfish want, is to further the demise of the people&#8217;s trust.  For the blue dogs it is their ignorance of their economic ideology that creates the mistrust.  The republicans/blue dogs, and those helping them by lending their &#8220;professionalism&#8221;, think they are only effecting a political strategy.  In truth, they are destroying the very basis for the wealth they desire.  Their entire campaign for decades to discredit, to instill mistrust in the primary institution we have, the US (We the People) government, has been the primary cause to our economic decline.  To increase the level of distrust is to decrease the available “intangible capital” which is  77% of our wealth generating power.   </p>
<p>Pushing tax cuts, dear republicans and blue dogs, is actually working against the economic goal you profess to desire for the American people because enacting tax cuts promotes the weakest power of our economy while the promoting of tax cuts is destroying the strongest power of our economy. </p>

<blockquote>Honda Motor Co. now expects 185 billion yen ($2.06 billion) in group net profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 &#8212; less than a third of the 600 billion yen it earned last fiscal year.<br />For every yen the dollar declines, Honda loses about 18 billion yen ($200 million) in operating profit. In trading Wednesday, the dollar fell as low as 88.15 yen.</p></blockquote>
<p>And is making some changes based on the results: <br />
<blockquote>Underlining the tough times ahead, Fukui refused to set a vehicles sales target for 2009 &#8212; an unusual move for Honda.<br />To take responsibility for the faltering results, Honda directors will take a 10 percent pay cut and further bonus reductions are likely, he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Honda said it was pulling out of the glamorous but expensive Formula One racing to save costs and focus on its core car business.  (Hey, it&#8217;s not NASCAR so who care?  I do.)</p>
<p>Honda lowered its sales forecast for the fiscal year through March by 13 percent to 10.4 trillion yen ($116.9 billion).</p>
<p>The company also trimmed annual investment spending by 60 billion yen ($674 million) to about 650 billion yen ($7.3 billion) to cut costs during hard times, including scrapping plans to introduce the Acura luxury line in Japan by 2010. Plans to develop a successor to the NSX sportscar were also canceled.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are layoffs: <br />
<blockquote>Honda had already said it was cutting 760 temporary workers in Japan, or nearly 18 percent of its Japan temporary work force of 4,300. On Wednesday, Honda said another 450 temporary workers in Japan will be reduced through February. </p></blockquote>
<p> That&#8217;s all they have to cut?  No regulars getting the axe? Don&#8217;t they know it&#8217;s the workers fault?</p>
<p>Toyota has done some math too.<br />
<blockquote>Toyota is also reducing production. In a key setback, Toyota said earlier this week that it&#8217;s delaying indefinitely the start of production at its plant in Blue Springs, Mississippi. The plant had been scheduled to begin in 2010&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p> Hey Cochran baby, how&#8217;s that work&#8217;n for ya in old Mississippi? </p>

<p>Pulled from comments (to the Librarian post at Eschaton):<br />
<blockquote>[W]ithout economic knowledge, DFHs don&#8217;t understand why the bailout of banks so that they would keep credit flowing is critical, while the bailout of the auto industry caused by the fact that the banks spent the money on acquisitions and executive pay instead of lending it, is not critical.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which leads us to the reality that the problem is the dealer contracts, since <a href="http://cabdrollery.blogspot.com/2008/12/yes-they-could.html">GM in Brazil is gaining market share</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Nonetheless, GM here in Brazil is faring well among the other three giants, Fiat, Volkswagen and Ford. According to the latest numbers, GM sold 444,000 automobiles in Brazil from January to November. This is a 10.4% increase from the same time period last year. In the light commercial segment, which saw 76,000 units sold, there was an impressive growth of 60% again in the same period. Here, Chevrolet continues to be a respectful brand. Also, like other assembly plants installed in Brazil, flex cars already dominate a substantial part of production at GM.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s easier to rely on Flex Cars when you&#8217;re using a useful source for ethanol, instead of corn. (See Tom&#8217;s multiple postings on the subject, both <a href="http://www.google.com/custom?domains=angrybear.blogspot.com&#038;q=ethanol+Bozzo&#038;sa=Google+Search&#038;sitesearch=angrybear.blogspot.com&#038;client=pub-7495486645615446&#038;forid=1&#038;channel=2832893407&#038;ie=ISO-8859-1&#038;oe=ISO-8859-1&#038;cof=GALT%3A%23008000%3BGL%3A1%3BDIV%3A%23336699%3BVLC%3A663399%3BAH%3Acenter%3BBGC%3AFFFFFF%3BLBGC%3A336699%3BALC%3A0000FF%3BLC%3A0000FF%3BT%3A000000%3BGFNT%3A0000FF%3BGIMP%3A0000FF%3BFORID%3A1&#038;hl=en">here</a> and <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&#038;as_q=&#038;as_epq=&#038;as_oq=ethanol+E85&#038;as_eq=&#038;num=10&#038;lr=&#038;as_filetype=&#038;ft=i&#038;as_sitesearch=atbozzo.blogspot.com&#038;as_qdr=all&#038;as_rights=&#038;as_occt=any&#038;cr=&#038;as_nlo=&#038;as_nhi=&#038;safe=images">at MU</a>.)</p>
<p>And about those workers who (foolishly, per Senators who are paid much more than $73/hour, even if you pretend they work &#8220;full-time&#8221;) accepted the companies promises of a pension and health benefits in place of being paid?  Well, Malcolm Gladwell had the data <strong><em><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/08/28/060828fa_fact?printable=true">over a year ago</a></em></strong>:<br />
<blockquote>Walter Reuther&#8230;believed that risk ought to be broadly collectivized. Charlie Wilson, on the other hand, felt the way the business leaders of Toledo did: that collectivization was a threat to the free market and to the autonomy of business owners. In his view, companies themselves ought to assume the risks of providing insurance.</p>
<p>General Motors, the country’s largest automaker, is between forty and fifty billion dollars behind in the money it needs to fulfill its health-care and pension promises. This crisis is sometimes portrayed as the result of corporate America’s excessive generosity in making promises to its workers. But when it comes to retirement, health, disability, and unemployment benefits there is nothing exceptional about the United States: it is average among industrialized countries—more generous than Australia, Canada, Ireland, and Italy, just behind Finland and the United Kingdom, and on a par with the Netherlands and Denmark. The difference is that in most countries the government, or large groups of companies, provides pensions and health insurance. The United States, by contrast, has over the past fifty years followed the lead of Charlie Wilson and the bosses of Toledo and made individual companies responsible for the care of their retirees. It is this fact, as much as any other, that explains the current crisis. In 1950, Charlie Wilson was wrong, and Walter Reuther was right.</p></blockquote>

<p>I mean it is bad enough that failure of the Big 3 means the loss of maybe 3 million jobs. Why are you trying to put Dale Earnhardt Jr. out of a job? </p>
<p>Seriously what would the economic impact be to red states if not only NASCAR but all the other car and truck racing circuits collapsed? NASCAR made a run at getting Washington State to build a track here at taxpayer expense with the claim that the positive economic impact would dwarf the expenditure. (The Leg didn&#8217;t bite). But you can&#8217;t deny the economic impact of having some hundreds of thousands of fans visiting town for a couple of weekends a year.<br /><a href="http://www.nascar.com/races/cup/2009/data/schedule.html">NASCAR schedule</a> Sure there are some blue states on the list. But this article claims the impact of the Daytona 500 alone is over $1 BILLION <a href="http://www.paddocktalk.com/news/html/modules.php?op=modload&#038;name=News&#038;file=article&#038;sid=73891">Paddocktalk</a> &#8220;Well we stuck it right to the Yankees. Ha Ha! Too bad there won&#8217;t be any races at <a href="http://www.kentuckyspeedway.com/default.aspx">Kentucky Speedway</a> this year. Or ever again.&#8221; Somehow I am not sure Mitch McConnell really thought this one through. How much is he really willing to put on the line to have GM workers take a $3/hr paycut a couple of years earlier?</p>
<p>Plus I hear football is kind of popular in both red and blue states. Who is going to pay for all the truck commercials? I suppose that as long as Americans don&#8217;t give up drinking beer that televised sports will continue. But the economic impact of the Big 3 goes far beyond parts makers and car dealers. The GOP is playing with dynamite here, the political ads practically write themselves.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Skip Sauer of The Sports Economist was also <a href="http://thesportseconomist.com/2008/12/nascar-auto-bailout.htm">all over this one on Tuesday</a>, though somewhat cautious:<br />
<blockquote>My sense is that brand loyalty &#8212; NASCAR is the marketing king of sport &#8212; may be the key factor. It is not uncommon in NASCAR country to see window stickers on a Ford truck that show a punkish-looking boy pissing on the Chevy logo. A strong form of negative brand identity, I submit. If the Ford and Chevy brands are irreparably damaged, will those loyalties transfer to Honda and Toyota?</p></blockquote>
<p>UPDATE TWO: Must have been something in the air. The NYT weighs in: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/14/business/14nascar.html">NASCAR sponsors hit by sticker shock</a></p>

                                <p>Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>reads <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/opinion/10friedman.html">Tom Friedman</a> and wonders why.</p>
<p>I guess Friedman doesn&#8217;t like bailing out the Detroit Three which collectively sell millions of vehicles in the U.S. when we could get in on the ground floor with start-ups with interesting ideas but which otherwise sell none.  Maybe it&#8217;s the <a href="http://emsnews.wordpress.com/2008/11/14/flat-earth-friedmans-wealth-is-vanishing/">CRE bust talking</a>, but Friedman&#8217;s imagery is not exactly spot-on:<br />
<blockquote>[O]ur bailout of Detroit will be remembered as the equivalent of pouring billions of dollars of taxpayer money into the mail-order-catalogue business on the eve of the birth of eBay.</p></blockquote>
<p>So eBay was founded in 1995; meanwhile the <a href="http://www.the-dma.org/donotmail/">Direct Marketing Association</a>, in its effort to forestall (for better or worse*) do-not-mail initiatives, says that there&#8217;s nevertheless about $700 billion per year in U.S. commerce associated with direct mail marketing.  So it&#8217;s not so obviously stupid to spend some billions in a pinch to preserve that output and the hundreds of thousands of associated jobs.</p>
<p>Then to try to show what dinosaurs the Three are, Friedman writes:<br />
<blockquote>Remember, in 1908, the Ford Model-T got better mileage — 25 miles per gallon — than many Ford, G.M. and Chrysler models made in 2008.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now anyone with half a brain can look up the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Model_T">Wikipedia entry</a>, which in turn links to a <a href="http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=858">Ford page</a> that contends that the 20-hp engine in the 1,200-lb. Model T actually turned in 13 to 21 miles per gallon.  (&#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desk_Set#Plot">Desk Set</a>&#8221; truly is ancient history.)  Moreover a 25 MPG vehicle of 2008 offers such amenities as performance, comfort, and safety!  Not only that, but the Ford Focus or Chevy Cobalt of today not only are superior in every automotive way, but even cost less, adjusted for inflation, than the $850 (nominal) 1908 Model T.  While the U.S. industry hasn&#8217;t exactly been ahead of the curve in developing efficient and marketable cars, and the cost of their neglect of the bread-and-butter car market is substantial, to suggest that they&#8217;re necessarily doomed is ridiculous.**</p>
<p>An important point that seems to have been lost in the auto bailout debate, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/11/big-three.html">made here by Save_The_Rustbelt</a> not too long ago, is that Ford and GM pretty much had restructurings in progress as of the start of the tailspin which, while not a sure thing, nevertheless were reasonably calculated to put them on the right course by the tweens.  When hundreds of billions of dollars are thrown around to try to rescue the economy from bets that shouldn&#8217;t have been made in the first place and which appropriate prudential regulation will prevent later suckers from making at some future date, putting a few tens of billions at risk to stop a big chunk of manufacturing from imminent collapse is far from the stupidest thing in the world.</p>
<p>* Advertising mail might not exactly be popular, but it helps keep Netflix and occasional thank-you notes to &#8220;Grandma Millie&#8221; cheap.</p>
<p>** Chrysler LLC possibly excepted.</p>

                                <p>by: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Ok, the auto CEO&#8217;s are all lined up.  They get asked the populist setup question: Are you going to sell your jets?  And they just sat there, as dumb looking as could be.  They didn&#8217;t say a word.  Not a word!  To me, that proved they were the wrong people for the current job because either they did not know to answer or did not know what to answer with.</p>
<p>If the CEO&#8217;s not knowing to answer a basic setup question that should have been anticipated (read they should have gotten coached better if they did at all) is not enough to question their management ability (it also suggests the boards have not been asking any unexpected questions either over the term of their positions) well, consider <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20081205_a_toyota_takeover_could_save_gm/">the following</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Last year General Motors ranked as the fifth-largest company in the world, with sales of $207 billion and a loss of around $2 billion. Toyota, meanwhile, ranked in 2007 as the sixth-largest company in the world, with sales approaching $205 billion and a profit of $14 billion. </p>
<p>Those numbers changed dramatically in 2008, with GM falling from fifth to ninth with sales of $182 billion and a loss of nearly $39 billion, while Toyota moved up to fifth place with sales of $230 billion and a profit of $15 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, here is what really got me as I watched GM&#8217;s CFO, Ray Young (Mr. Young was instrumental in putting together GM&#8217;s long-term restructuring plan after Congress demanded that the Big Three present such plans&#8230;) on <a href="http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&#038;products_id=282718-5">Washington Journal on 12/5/08</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8230;and that&#8217;s the reason why we support the concept yesterday, of this oversight committee to supervise the restructuring of our industry.<br />I think from our perspective, we&#8217;re very open.  There&#8217;s talk about having an automotive Czar designated by the government to look at the entire industry.<br />&#8230;the advantage of having this oversight committee and having an industry czar is the fact that they can look at the American automobile industry on a wholistic basis and determine how we can restructure the industry to be globally competitive.  </p></blockquote>
<p>In all this time of GM&#8217;s existence they have not been able to assess the market as a whole including globally to determine what was needed in order for them to be “globally competitive”?  What the hell have they been looking at?  Isn&#8217;t this suppose to be part of basic business management skill? Now they want government help to figure this out?  Is this not asking for central market control light, as in China and Russia American style? I don&#8217;t know whether to laugh at them or cry for us.</p>
<p>Remind me, what freakin&#8217; side of the fuel mileage standard argument were they on back in the 80&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/political-science/speeches/bush.dir/b48.txtp">and 90&#8217;s</a>?<br />
<blockquote>July 21, 1992<br />                THE CLINTON-GORE CAFE PROPOSALS:<br />                   LOSS OF JOBS, LOSS OF LIVES<br />CLINTON: &#8220;In my administration, we&#8217;ll&#8230;seek to raise the average<br />goal for automakers to 40 mpg by the year 2000, 45 mpg by the<br />year 2020.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And which industry took the positive concept of <a href="http://laramie.willshireltd.com/DynamicObsolescence.html">dynamic obsolescence </a>(continuous improvement to promote sales, excluding the wastefulness issue, that&#8217;s a different post) and turned it into the negative of <a href="http://repairny.com/our-world/86-planned-obsolescence-planned-junk.html">planned obsolescence</a>(early demise of the item to promote accelerated sales)?</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m reading this response by Mr. Young wrong, and it is not that they are admitting that they don&#8217;t know what they have been doing, that they don&#8217;t know how to assess the market local or otherwise, in a way that leads them to be sustainably competitive.  </p>
<p>Maybe they are playing congress.  Sort of a: Hey, sure we&#8217;ll agree to some government oversight (is that all we have to say to get the money?).  But, if that is true, then they are being dishonest in their genuineness.  They are acting as frauds which means we would be fools to give them the money without expecting some management personnel changes.  We will have been played.</p>
<p>Personally I think it is both that they don&#8217;t know how to manage by virtue of the market profitability numbers presented above and by their very own CFO&#8217;s admission to wanting a communism economics inspired concept put in place for their market.  Though Mr. Young mostly noted Japan&#8217;s automotive market approach, so I guess he wants more of a socialistic form of central market control.  Imagine that, GM wants some form of socialism with a dash of communism.  They even use the Russian term for a central planner.  So, what say you of the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/11/20/conservatives-blame-cafe/">republican persuasion</a>?  </p>

<blockquote><p>Chrysler is the smallest of the Big Three automakers, but it stands apart from its peers in another crucial respect. While General Motors and the Ford Motor Company are public corporations, Chrysler is controlled by one of the world’s richest and most secretive private investment companies.</p>
<p>That investment company is Mr. Snow’s employer, Cerberus Capital Management, which has used its wealth and deep connections in Washington to shape the debate over the foundering automakers to its advantage.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Mr. Snow has personally lobbied Mr. Paulson and others for a federal rescue that would salvage Cerberus’s investments in Detroit. Cerberus has also deployed a corps of lobbyists and former government officials to secure a bailout and protect its interests.</p>
<p>Whether its efforts will work is unclear. But if they fail Cerberus and its partners could lose their daring bets on Detroit. Without a bailout Cerberus could lose about $2 billion and suffer a stinging blow to its reputation. With one it might eventually profit from its troubled deals.</p>
<p>Last year, Cerberus and about 100 co-investors bought 80.1 percent of Chrysler for $7.4 billion from the German carmaker Daimler. It also bought a controlling stake in GMAC, the finance arm of General Motors. Since then Chrysler has eliminated more than 30,000 jobs and struggled to keep itself afloat while its sales have plummeted. Cerberus is pressing to have Chrysler merge with G.M., but G.M. has said a tie-up is off the table. Chrysler is asking the government for $7 billion to get through the next few months.</p>
<p>Cerberus, named after the mythical three-headed dog that guards the gates of Hades, has a fierce reputation on Wall Street. Many bankers and investors are reluctant to talk openly about the company, which is renowned, even feared, for its hard-nosed deal-making.</p></blockquote>
