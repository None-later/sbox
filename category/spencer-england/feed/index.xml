<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but when I recently updated this chart I was pleasantly surprised by how much the deficit had improved.  In the third quarter of 2012 &#8211;the last quarter of the previous fiscal year &#8212; the deficit had already fallen to 7.0% of GDP as compared to the peak of 10.5% in the fourth quarter of 2009.  </p>
<p>Moreover, with the ending of the tax break on payroll taxes and higher taxes on the top incomes as well as  prospects for improved growth in 2013 we may be experiencing the best improvement in the deficit picture since the Clinton presidency.  Moreover, the large scale shifting of incomes back to 2012 to avoid higher taxes implies that the last quarter of 2012 could also show a big improvement. This chart clearly shows why all the deficit hawks are keeping quiet on what is actually happening to the deficit</p>

<p>The employment report was better than expected as Sandy apparently did not have the widely expected negative impact.  But the data essentially shows that the recent trend of weak employment continued as payrolls expanded some 146,000 and the household survey showed a -122,00 drop.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WGXTryoy5-M/UMICwHKBcQI/AAAAAAAACWk/CR3E3SxP3xc/s1600/Clipboard01+emp++change.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WGXTryoy5-M/UMICwHKBcQI/AAAAAAAACWk/CR3E3SxP3xc/s320/Clipboard01+emp++change.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>Private payrolls expanded some  147,00 as government employment fell about 1,000.  The expansion of private payrolls  was within the range of recent reports.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1aXHJQX75QM/UMH_l5Mh52I/AAAAAAAACVM/_K7jadLWp_M/s1600/Clipboard01+private+payroll.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1aXHJQX75QM/UMH_l5Mh52I/AAAAAAAACVM/_K7jadLWp_M/s320/Clipboard01+private+payroll.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>The year over year change in both measures &#8212; to smooth out monthly noise &#8212; is still about the same..</p>
<p> <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I_X27IE7bvs/UMICjo7jIcI/AAAAAAAACWQ/V0GnPrIaVww/s1600/Clipboard01+emp+growth.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-I_X27IE7bvs/UMICjo7jIcI/AAAAAAAACWQ/V0GnPrIaVww/s320/Clipboard01+emp+growth.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>The unemployment rate fell to 7.7% , but the drop was due more to -350,000 contraction in the labor  force than higher employment.</p>
<p> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ATBuAS4Mk2Y/UMIDBqhLJ1I/AAAAAAAACW8/A8dW4JN66Vs/s1600/Clipboard01+rate.bmp"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ATBuAS4Mk2Y/UMIDBqhLJ1I/AAAAAAAACW8/A8dW4JN66Vs/s320/Clipboard01+rate.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>The average workweek was stable at 33.4 hours and the index of aggregrate hours worked rose 0.2%.<br />For production or nonsupervisory hours worked expanded 0.4%&#8211; a little better than the total.</p>
<p> <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mmvUZsBLqIg/UMIC3i5sFOI/AAAAAAAACWs/vj2e_X1VPCw/s1600/Clipboard01+hours.bmp"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mmvUZsBLqIg/UMIC3i5sFOI/AAAAAAAACWs/vj2e_X1VPCw/s320/Clipboard01+hours.bmp" width="320"></a><br />  <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_suNmJWKwKc/UMIC7tEtVJI/AAAAAAAACW0/Ziiw-ukt5jQ/s1600/Clipboard01+hours+in+cycle.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_suNmJWKwKc/UMIC7tEtVJI/AAAAAAAACW0/Ziiw-ukt5jQ/s320/Clipboard01+hours+in+cycle.bmp" width="320"></a><br />  <br /> Average hourly earnings  rose from $23.59 to $23.69.  But its growth is still at record lows.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WQGvjPXZ-dQ/UMIDGrzZk-I/AAAAAAAACXE/CGGaE5os8FY/s1600/Clipboard1+xahe.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WQGvjPXZ-dQ/UMIDGrzZk-I/AAAAAAAACXE/CGGaE5os8FY/s320/Clipboard1+xahe.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>Average weekly earnings growth remained very weak at about  1.7%.  This is in sharp contrast to the widespread expectations  that income will spike higher in the 4th quarter as individuals shift income from 2013 back to 2012 to avoid or minimize the expected tax rate increase in 2013.But the hourly wage employees in this report have little or no ability to shift income.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lifted from comments from this post <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/us-to-be-leading-producer-of-oil-what.html" target="_blank">US to be leading producer of oil</a> is Spencer England&#8217;s comment about structural change in the oil markets.  Obvious to some but bears repeating for a lot of us, as we discuss environmental issues or gasoline prices in the media more than structural economic impacts:</p>
<p>Spencer says:</p>
<p>The development of fracking and the tar sands means that the oil industry is undergoing a major structural change.</p>
<p>Use to be that one of the thing that made the oil industry very unique was that virtually all their costs were sunk or fixed costs and variable costs were relatively insignificant. Under this cost structure if prices fall it still pays to produce oil when prices fell as long as revenues covered the variable costs. So falling prices did not lead to falling output.</p>
<p>But now the marginal supply of oil is from tar sands or fracking where variable costs are very high. Moreover, the marginal costs of bringing in new oil from these sources is now in the $80 to $100 range.</p>
<p>So now, when prices fall, at the margin some producers will withdraw from the market and output will fall.</p>
<p>This is creating a fairly solid floor, the price for oil at about $80 &#8212; where oil bottomed last year and again this year.</p>
<p>Very few people are incorporating this structural change in the oil market into their analysis.</p>

<p>This was another mixed employment report.  The headline increase of 171,000 increase in payroll employment and 410,000 rise in employment reported in the household survey appeared strong.  But  other signs of weakness appeared within the report.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wwjqya2WuEQ/UJPE4YJ4CgI/AAAAAAAACTo/UXi2OqvD67s/s1600/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wwjqya2WuEQ/UJPE4YJ4CgI/AAAAAAAACTo/UXi2OqvD67s/s320/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>The 184,000 increase in private payroll employment was the strongest since February.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y8GNc7ghN_w/UJPFAZJ0cgI/AAAAAAAACTw/Up5j8noiHFk/s1600/Clipboard01+private.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-y8GNc7ghN_w/UJPFAZJ0cgI/AAAAAAAACTw/Up5j8noiHFk/s320/Clipboard01+private.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<div></div>
<div>The unemployment rate ticked up from 7.8 to 7.9.  But this may actually be a bullish development because it stemmed from a 578,000 jump in the labor force.  A large increase in the labor force may mean that people are more optimistic about employment prospects and are rejoining the labor force.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Moreover, the number of people working part time for economic reasons fell -304,000.</div>
<p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yyistIN0nok/UJPHoNdLF1I/AAAAAAAACUk/uih_J86t8Cs/s1600/Clipboard01+rate.bmp" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yyistIN0nok/UJPHoNdLF1I/AAAAAAAACUk/uih_J86t8Cs/s320/Clipboard01+rate.bmp" width="320"></a></div>
<p>But the  work week fell from  33.7 to 33.6 and the index of aggregate hours works fell -0.1 from 103.8 to 103.7.  Relative to the trend establish early in this cycle, hours worked has been weak for several months..</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CO8Rj9PYENE/UJPFK6P_7SI/AAAAAAAACT4/84uvcTSS8Yw/s1600/Clipboard01+hours.bmp"><img border="0" height="232" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-CO8Rj9PYENE/UJPFK6P_7SI/AAAAAAAACT4/84uvcTSS8Yw/s320/Clipboard01+hours.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>Moreover average hourly earnings was essentially unchanged as it fell from $19.80 to $19.79..<br />The growth in average hourly earnings plunged to  1.2%, an all time record low.</p>
<p> <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Zx1Zaj_zlE/UJPFihPZhtI/AAAAAAAACUI/e6E2OJ-dkew/s1600/Clipboard01+xahe.bmp"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6Zx1Zaj_zlE/UJPFihPZhtI/AAAAAAAACUI/e6E2OJ-dkew/s320/Clipboard01+xahe.bmp" width="320"></a></p>
<p>Average weekly fell from $667.26 to $664.94 and the year over year growth rate was only 1.2%, the smallest gain in this cycle.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div>I hear so many things about how investors prefer a Republican president I often  wonder if they have ever looked at the data.  Of course from just looking at a chart of the S&#038;;P 500 since WWII  it is hard to see how the market has performed under different presidents.</div>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--eJLmANGOBc/UIWCE86QeyI/AAAAAAAACTI/aFAecVXKHBg/s1600/Clipboard01+s&#038;p.bmp"><img border="0" height="290" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--eJLmANGOBc/UIWCE86QeyI/AAAAAAAACTI/aFAecVXKHBg/s400/Clipboard01+s&#038;p.bmp" width="400"> </a></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Maybe this chart that shows the percent change under each president would make it a little clearer.</div>
<div>It shows that in the modern era the S&#038;P 500 provided miserable returns under two administrations &#8212;</div>
<div>Nixon-Ford and Bush Jr. </div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-200rAh32I_s/UIWCRCbbFoI/AAAAAAAACTQ/YJrHIo1pojs/s1600/Clipboard01+percent+change.bmp"><img border="0" height="290" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-200rAh32I_s/UIWCRCbbFoI/AAAAAAAACTQ/YJrHIo1pojs/s400/Clipboard01+percent+change.bmp" width="400"></a> </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>But maybe the  best way is to look at a table of this data.  The table shows that since WW II the market increased 261.8 % under Republican presidents and 449.1% under Democratic presidents.  But Republicans have held office for 36 years while Democrats have  held the Presidency for 31.6 years &#8212; Truman was president for 7 years and 5 months while Obama still has 3 months to go to fill his first term. Taking the annual average to adjust for this, shows that the average annual returns under Republicans was 7.3%  and under Democrats it was 14.2%, or almost double the rate of return under Republicans.  If your well being depends heavily on stock returns, as most portfolio managers does, you are clearly better off now than you were four years ago.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div> <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-stRgn4gKdME/UIWB-MyO-5I/AAAAAAAACTA/1XtyhGP69dw/s1600/Clipboard01+table.bmp"><img border="0" height="186" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-stRgn4gKdME/UIWB-MyO-5I/AAAAAAAACTA/1XtyhGP69dw/s400/Clipboard01+table.bmp" width="400"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div>To address possible objections to this analysis I could add Hoover and Roosevelt but that would just make the Democrats larger and reduce the Republicans average returns.  The data is for the monthly average from the month they took office until the next president took office.  I do not have daily prices back far enough to use daily prices and my data on total returns, including dividend reinvestment, only goes back to 1970.  Truman took office after V-E Day and just before V-J Day, so his  inauguration  marks a very good way to date the start of the post WW II era.</div>

<p>In the Vice Presidential debate Ryan said that the Kennedy tax cuts generated so much growth that tax receipts increased enough to offset the revenue losses.</p>
<p>When I look at the data it sure looks like this claim is another one of his Any Rand fantasies.  The economy did grow rapidly after the Kennedy tax cuts,  but the deficit remained high. throughout  the  JFK-LBJ administration.  Moreover, like Reagan, LBJ finally had to raise taxes to recover the lost revenues.</p>

<p>The employment situation was mixed with the headline number, payroll employment adding 114,000 and the household report showing a gain of 873,000.
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yc0TslnhGFQ/UG7mpWmWnoI/AAAAAAAACSM/4-2ncO7gOTA/s1600/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="217" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yc0TslnhGFQ/UG7mpWmWnoI/AAAAAAAACSM/4-2ncO7gOTA/s320/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp" width="320"></a></div>
<p>To a great extent the very large increase in the household survey appears to be just a make up for earlier weakness when the payroll report was showing larger gains than the household survey.  On a year over year basis the two reports are showing very similar gains. <br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o-f4NdggulE/UG7eok02W4I/AAAAAAAACRI/Z6XWYH7jSak/s1600/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp"></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o-f4NdggulE/UG7eok02W4I/AAAAAAAACRI/Z6XWYH7jSak/s1600/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp"><br /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o-f4NdggulE/UG7eok02W4I/AAAAAAAACRI/Z6XWYH7jSak/s1600/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp"></a>

<p>With the very large gain in the household survey the unemployment rate fell to 7.8%.  It is now lower than when Obama took office.  In the modern era every democratic administration saw the unemployment rate fall during their term in office while only one Republican saw the unemployment rate lower when they left office than it was when they took office.  That was Reagan.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o-f4NdggulE/UG7eok02W4I/AAAAAAAACRI/Z6XWYH7jSak/s1600/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp"><br /></a><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-o-f4NdggulE/UG7eok02W4I/AAAAAAAACRI/Z6XWYH7jSak/s1600/Clipboard01+CHANGE.bmp"><br /></a>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bill McBride at <a href="http://www.calculatedriskblog.com/">Calculated Risk</a> does his usual excellent job of reporting economic data;</p>
<p>He just reported the state unemployment rates and published a chart comparing the current rate with each state&#8217;s peak rate.</p>
<p>One very significant point that popps up in this chart is that Michigan and Ohio appear to have had the greatest improvement in their unemployment rates since their unemployment rates peaked.  I think this is an important thing to consider when we evaluate the impact of the auto bailout and why Obama appears to be leading in the Presidential polls in those two states. </p>

<p>Average hourly earnings was unchanged and the year over year change remained at last months record<br />low.    Average weekly earnings for nonsupervisory workers only rose 1.6% over the last years while for all private workers the gain was 2%</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Update: <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/31/the-secret-of-our-un-success/" target="_blank">Paul Krugman</a> at <i>Conscience of a Liberal</i> points to Spencer England&#8217;s post in his column 8/1&#8230;Dan</p>
<p>I thought it would be interesting to post this chart of real private GDP in recoveries.</p>
<p>It clearly shows that since the great moderation we have experienced three recoveries that compared to previous recoveries were very weak.  Whether this is the new norm is open to debate.</p>
<p>But interestingly, at this point in the recovery this measure of real private GDP is exactly the same as it was in the last cycle under Bush that Larry Kudlow called the &#8220;Goldilocks&#8221; recovery.</p>
