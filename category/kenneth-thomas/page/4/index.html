<p>New Report Highlights Flaws of North Carolina Mega-Incentives </p>
<p>My <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">new report</a> for the North Carolina Budget and Tax Center, <i>Special Deals, Special Problems&#8211;An Analysis of North Carolina&#8217;s Legislature-Approved Economic Development Incentives</i>, has just been published. It covers a range of issues I&#8217;ve emphasized here before as well as some basic considerations reporters really need to pay more attention to.    </p>
<p>North Carolina has some of the best economic development practices in the country, in terms of <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">online transparency</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">performance requirements</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">use of clawbacks</a> for non-performance by companies, sunset clauses for tax expenditures, hard caps for many tax credit programs (see my report on these points), etc. The state publishes an <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">economic development inventory</a> I consider to be of very high quality and consistent with international definitions of a subsidy. The most recent edition shows that in the 2008-9 fiscal year the state spent about $1.2 billion on economic development, enough to hire 24,000 people at $50,000 a year in wages and benefits.    </p>
<p>At the same time, however, the state has persistently had problems in overvaluing potential investments and consequently offering wildly excessive subsidies for them. The best known case is <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">Dell in 2004</a>, when Virginia offered the company a $37 million incentive package, while the state and local bid from North Carolina came to almost $300 million on a nominal basis ($174 million present value). Other deals discussed in the report are Google ($260 million nominal value, $140 million present value), Apple ($321 million over 30 years nominal value, no present value calculation available), and a provision in a 2011 special incentives bill to allow Alex Lee Inc. to keep $2 million it should have forfeited for not keeping job promises. This last case illustrates how special legislative deals weaken the state&#8217;s performance requirements; this case will make future companies think that there may be no penalty for non-performance.    </p>
<p>Reporters take note! This publication describes useful techniques for comparing the size of incentive packages regardless of project size or payout period of the incentive. From the European Union I borrow the term &#8220;aid intensity,&#8221; which measures the size of the incentive relative to the amount of the investment or the number of jobs created. The idea is that a $1 million incentive would be large for a call center but a rounding error for an automobile assembly plant. As a result, we need a standardized way of comparing incentives.    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>While in this country one can sometimes find cost per job analyzed for some subsidy packages, the EU actually uses the subsidy/investment metric as its primary measure of aid intensity. <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">In my last post</a> I discussed a mall redevelopment which could conceivably have an aid intensity of 96%. For comparison purposes, we should note that the highest aid intensity allowed for large firms anywhere in the European Union, is 50%, and that is only allowed in the poorest regions of the EU, mainly in eastern Europe. (Richer regions have lower allowable maxima.) A region&#8217;s maximum is cut by half for large projects over 50 million euro, and by 66% for spending over 100 million euro.    </p>
<p>The other important concept is present value, a familiar one to accountants and economists, but not widely understood among the general public. The basic idea is simple: receiving a dollar today is worth more than receiving a dollar next year, which is worth more than receiving a dollar in two years, etc. Since incentive packages can pay out immediately (with a cash grant) or over a period of 30 or more years, we need to use present value to properly compare the size of incentives with different payout periods. This requires finding a a &#8220;discount rate&#8221; by which to reduce future payments. We then use the present value as the numerator in calculating aid intensity to be able to compare across different sizes of projects.    </p>
<p>Using Google as an example, this $600 million project will receive $260 million over 30 years and create 210 jobs. As mentioned above, this is its nominal cost, before discounting the future dollars. Following the practice of a 1990s study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to compare subsidies among its then 23 members, I used a discount rate equal to the 10-year Treasury bond yield to come up with a present value of $140.6 million. Then the aid intensity is $140.6 million/$600 million, or 23%, and the cost per job at present value is $669,489.</p>
<p>We can then use these two measures of aid intensity to compare the incentive to that given for other projects and inform our judgment of whether it was a better or worse deal than other states have made, in the current context where states make such deals all the time. Of course, I believe there should be limits placed on state and local governments so we can sharply reduce net incentive spending, which has few national benefits&#8211;but that is a long time in the future.    </p>
<p>North Carolina provides an intriguing case study because it does so much right in economic development, but it makes special deals outside its statutory incentive programs. The result is high costs and weakened bargaining position in the future. It&#8217;s a case we can learn a lot from. </p>

<p>Guest post: Basics: How Overrepresented Are Rural and Low-Population States? </p>
<p>We all kinda sorta know it: rural and small states are overrepresented in the Senate and, to a lesser extent, the Electoral College.This has deep roots in American history, of course: when the United States Constitution was drafted, small states demanded the Senate, with two votes for every state, to guarantee they would not be overwhelmed by the larger states politically. But today, when we have much greater population differences among states than in 1787, this takes on much more anti-democratic significance than it did then. Because each state has two Senators, political changes favoring the middle class are much harder to achieve than if everyone in the country were equally represented, in a mathematical sense, in Congress. Moreover, with the existence of the filibuster (<a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2012/05/15/32437/lawsuit-tries-dump-filibuster/">recently challenged in court</a> by Common Cause), the effect of this overrepresentation is substantially magnified. But how big is the effect after the 2010 Census?</p>
<p>Under the Senate&#8217;s filibuster rules, 41 Senators can block debate on Senate bills and nomination confirmations. So the first question is what percentage of the 50 states&#8217; population do the 21 smallest states have. The 2010 Census showed the states to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population">308.1 million</a> (all quoted figures are subject to slight rounding error) population, with the smallest 21, from Wyoming&#8217;s 564,000 to Iowa&#8217;s 3 million, having a total of 34.8 million, or just 11.3% of the 50-state population. In theory, Senators representing those states could mount a successful filibuster. Of course, this is unrealistic, since some small states are heavily Democratic, such as Vermont, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and Delaware. Even Montana currently has two Democratic Senators.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Another way to look at the filibuster is to ask what percentage of the 50-state population is represented by the 41 Republican Senators from the least populous states. The answer takes the actual population of states with any Republican Senators, except Texas (Cornyn and Hutchison), Florida (Rubio), Illinois (Kirk), Pennsylvania (Toomey), and Ohio (Portman). The population of the states represented by the other 41 Republican Senators is 104.7 million, or 34.0% of the population of the 50 states. Thus, states with just a third of the country&#8217;s population can block legislation or Presidential nominations. With the recent skyrocketing use of the filibuster in the Senate, this is profoundly undemocratic.    </p>
<p>Turning to the Electoral College, we can again see the effect of having a minimum of two Senators regardless of population, which means that each state (and the District of Columbia) has a minimum of three electors in the Electoral College. For example, the Real Clear Politics <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/2012_elections_electoral_college_map.html">Electoral College map</a> lists just 11 states and the District of Columbia as likely Obama, whereas 17 states are likely Romney. Even though the likely Obama states have more electoral votes than the likely Romney states (161 to 131), 6 of the Democratic states have double-digit electoral votes whereas only two of the Republican states do, underlining how Romney benefits from the overrepresentation of rural states.</p>
<p>Finally, remembering the 2000 election, where President Bush was awarded more electoral votes despite losing the popular vote nationally, we can ask what the minimum percentage of population for the 50 states plus DC is needed to win the Electoral College. To answer this question, I tallied from the bottom to see how many states were required to top 270 electoral votes. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electoral_votes_by_US_state">Wikipedia</a> (as I tell my students, only a potentially reliable source for non-controversial information, like this), you have to have New Jersey to top 270, but it actually takes you to 282. So I subtracted three Democratic states (DE, VT, and DC) with 3 electoral votes as well as Montana&#8217;s 3 electoral votes (since it&#8217;s the most competitive of the remaining states with 3 EVs) to get down to 270. The 37 remaining states have only 45% of the nation&#8217;s population eligible to elect the President. Yet theoretically they could do just that.</p>
<p>This post has merely scratched the surface of the deep historical and constitutional questions that have led to Wyoming&#8217;s 564,000 people having as many Senators as California&#8217;s 37.7 million. The rural bias of the Senate and Electoral College make major political changes difficult to achieve, yet it is even more difficult to imagine that they could possibly be fundamentally altered, especially the Senate. Still, it is worth reflecting on these imbalances in order to understand the shortcomings that exist in American democracy.</p>

<p>Romney to Replace Obamacare with&#8230;Essentially Nothing </p>
<p>Tommy Christopher (via @rcooley123) at Mediaite <a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/the-devil-in-the-details-of-mitt-romneys-interview-with-times-mark-halperin/">has a good catch</a> on Mitt Romney&#8217;s health care proposals, from an interview Romney gave to <a href="http://thepage.time.com/2012/05/23/the-complete-romney-interview-transcript/">Mark Halperin</a> of Time magazine. Asked what would happen to people with pre-existing conditions after he were to repeal Obamacare, Romney said:<br />
<blockquote>If people have been continuously insured, and then they decide to change jobs or change locations, they should not be denied coverage if they go to a new place or have to get a new policy. So people continuously insured should be able to get new insurance.</p></blockquote>
<p>As Christopher points out, people who have been continuously insured already have this right, and have since 1996, under Title 1 of HIPAA. As he puts it, Romney &#8220;is selling you something you already owned.&#8221; And lest you think maybe Romney just misspoke, you can see the very same words in <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/issues/health-care">his platform</a>: &#8220;Prevent discrimination against individuals with pre-existing conditions who maintain continuous coverage.&#8221; So, on the critical question of pre-existing conditions, Romney is offering precisely nothing.  </p>
<p>That is hardly the end of Romney&#8217;s useless ideas on health care. His platform says we should return control over health insurance to the states. In principle, this could be workable; after all, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_%28Canada%29">in Canada</a> each province has its own health insurance plan. States are big enough entities to do this: if Prince Edward Island can have its own plan, so could Rhode Island. And there is diversity in the provincial plans: Quebec&#8217;s covers prescription medicine, while Ontario&#8217;s does not. But this only works because the federal government has strong conditions on what level of coverage the provinces can provide. Romney, on the other hand, says we should &#8220;Limit federal standards and requirements on both private insurance and Medicaid coverage.&#8221; This is a sure recipe for bad health insurance regulation at the state level.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Another plank in his health care platform is to &#8220;Empower individuals and small businesses to form purchasing pools.&#8221; This will not enable individuals or small businesses to have anywhere near as much bargaining power as the state insurance exchanges in the Affordable Care Act.  <br />Romney also says we should turn Medicaid into a block grant, giving states more flexibility. As <a href="http://theincidentaleconomist.com/wordpress/if-only-medicaid-had-some-flexibility/">Aaron Carroll</a> points out, states acquired a great deal of flexibility with Medicaid during the GW Bush Administration, but have not introduced any great innovations. Why Romney thinks that would change is anyone&#8217;s guess.<br />  <br />And of course, what would a Republican health care proposal be without the usual references to tort reform, &#8220;innovation grants to explore non-litigation alternatives to dispute resolution&#8221; (tort reform again), allowing insurance to be sold against state lines (which would weaken state&#8217;s ability to regulate; isn&#8217;t that where Romney said authority should be?) and getting rid of the tax deduction for employer-provided health care?  </p>
<p>So, instead of the Affordable Care Act, Romney promises to give us what we already have on pre-existing conditions, plus junk to give insurance companies even more control over the health care market than ever.  </p>

<p>Kabuki Theater Probably Won&#8217;t Shake Up NY Fed</p>
<p>Via @MarkThoma, <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/05/17/geithner-to-dimon-resign-from-the-board-of-the-new-york-fed/">Simon Johnson reports</a> that Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner has called (very diplomatically, of course) for JP Morgan Chase CEO to resign from his position with the New York Federal Reserve Bank in the wake of risk control failures that have already led to <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/05/-3-billion-and-counting-jp-morgans-loss-grows-by-50-in-5-days/257312/">$3 billion in losses</a> for the bank.. Johnson comments:<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Geithner’s call is a major and perhaps unprecedented development which can go in one of two ways.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If Mr. Dimon resigns, that is a major humiliation and recognition – at the highest levels of government – that even the country’s best connected banker has overstepped his limits. This would be a major victory for democracy and a step towards reopening the debate on financial reform, including introducing more restrictions on what global megabanks can do.</p></blockquote>
<p>Alternatively, Johnson says, if Dimon manages to stay on to the end of his term December 31, it will mean a defeat for democracy and a victory for the big banks.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Of course, there would be nothing new about this: one of the striking developments since the 2008 financial meltdown is that not a single major bank executive in the United States has gone to jail for their wrecking of the global economy. Moreover, the five largest banks in the country have <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/post/too-big-to-fail-watch/2012/05/16/gIQAHGI3TU_blog.html">seen their assets increase</a> from $6.1 trillion in 2008 to $8.5 trillion today. By contrast, in <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/02/road-not-taken-for-dealing-with-banks.html">Iceland</a>, 200 bank officials, including the CEOs of the country&#8217;s three largest banks, are all facing criminal charges for their actions leading up to the crisis. To use <a href="http://www.tyillc.blogspot.com/2012/02/policy-of-what-is-good-for-banks-is.html">Richard Fields&#8217; terms</a>, Iceland followed the Swedish model (make the banks take charges against profits immediately: bad for the banks, good for the economy) while the U.S. has followed the Japanese model (good for the banks, bad for the economy).  </p>
<p>While I have no special insight into the kabuki theater of high official pronouncements, I tend to agree with Johnson&#8217;s assessment that Dimon will probably remain on the New York Fed board. I say this for no other reason than the fact that, as the <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/aboutthefed/org_nydirectors.html">NY Fed&#8217;s website</a> points out, commercial banks who are members of the Federal Reserve System appoint 2/3 of the Board members. Three are appointed by the banks to represent themselves; Dimon is one of these. Another three are appointed by the banks ostensibly to represent the public. The banks selected the co-founder of a technology investment company, the CEO of HealthNow New York, and the CEO of Macy&#8217;s to represent &#8220;the public.&#8221; Hmm. The final three members are selected by the Fed&#8217;s Board of Governors to represent the public, but all are presidents of major institutions: Columbia University, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Partnership for New York City. So, 2/3 of the Board is selected to represent the public, but I feel pretty safe in saying that all nine Board members are in the 1%.  </p>
<p>Readers, what do you think? Will Jamie Dimon resign from the New York Fed? Take our poll and let us know.</p>

<p>Another Romney/Bain Firm Got Subsidies (Then Closed a Plant)</p>
<p> The <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/under-romney-bain-received-millions-tax-breaks-dade-behring-it-laid-hundreds">reports</a> (via <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/05/15/1091874/-The-Bain-Way-Take-millions-in-job-creation-tax-subsidies-then-turn-around-and-lay-off-hundreds?showAll=yes">Jed Lewison</a>) that another Bain-owned company, Dade Behring, was a recipient of $7.1 million in subsidies from Puerto Rico and the federal government the year before it laid off 300 workers there. A common problem with many subsidized projects, it took the money and ran without any consequences.<br />    <br />As I have pointed out before, another Bain-owned company, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/01/mitt-romneys-steel-dynamics-took.html">Steel Dynamics</a>, received at least $95 million in incentives from state and local governments in Indiana, for two separate investments. In fact, this exceeds the $85 million Bain made in profit from the firm.    </p>
<p>Now we have a third example of Bain-owned companies getting government subsidies. For a candidate who claims to be about private enterprise, Romney clearly doesn&#8217;t walk the walk. As Jed Lewison has <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/01/13/1054354/-Mitt-Romney-s-favorite-success-story-took-millions-in-government-aid">noted before</a>, it&#8217;s clear that when Romney talks about crony capitalism, he&#8217;s talking about himself.</p>
<p>How many other government subsidies are in Bain&#8217;s past? Inquiring minds want to know. </p>

<p>Leigh McIlvaine at <a href="http://clawback.org/2012/05/10/colorado-governor-doesnt-buy-sales-tax-giveaway/">Clawback</a> reports that Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper has vetoed SB 124, a bill that would have expanded the use of sales tax for tax increment financing of tourist projects under the Regional Tourism Act. While subsidy reformers in the state have so far been able to defeat sales tax TIF at the local level (unlike, for example, Missouri), the Regional Tourism Act allows this at the state level, but only for two projects per year expected to bring in tourists from out of state &#8212; not that interstate sales tax competition is such a great use of subsidy dollars anyway.<br />    <br />The bill would have made it possible to approve six projects in a single year. This would weaken oversight of the program since all the projects would have been approved at one time. As McIlvaine points out, the bill was especially controversial because Gaylord Entertainment in Aurora (near Denver International Airport), already heavily subsidized, had applied to receive a further subsidy through the Regional Tourism Act. Gaylord has already lured a major convention, the Western Stock Show, to relocate from Denver.    </p>

<p><a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/10/update-100-million-incentives-us-25-eu.html">Gaylord</a>, already in the top 25 subsidies in the U.S. since 2000 (a revised version of my paper on this is almost ready to go back to the journal) at $300 million, <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/news/2012/05/03/gaylord-exec-no-go-for-aurora.html?page=all">is demanding</a> that the state provide the full $85.4 million it has requested under the Regional Tourism Act or the $824 million project will not be built at all. This represents a nominal aid intensity of 46.8% of the investment and, according to <i>Denver Business Journal</i>, is more than twice as high a subsidy as Gaylord has ever received. The Colorado Economic Development Commission must make a decision on this and five other applications for the two awards on May 18.<br />     <br />The Governor&#8217;s veto ensures that only two projects can be approved this year and allows him to &#8220;keep limits on the on the new tax-incentive program before the state committed too much money on an annual basis to tourism projects,&#8221; as the <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/denver/blog/capitol_business/2012/05/kerr-harvey-proud-of-their-veto-pens.html"><i>Denver Business Journal</i></a> said Tuesday. The story notes that the bill only passed the House of Representatives by a 37-27 vote. This guarantees that the veto will not be overridden.<br />     <br />Though it was a bad move to approve state sales tax TIF at all, Hickenlooper&#8217;s veto prevents it from becoming a worse problem and slows the likely push to increase total subsidies under the program and weaken the targeting inherent in authorizing only two projects per year. For this, he is to be commended.   crossposted with <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/05/colorado-governor-hickenlooper-vetoes.html" target="_blank">Middle Class Political Economist</a></p>

<p><strong> New York&#8217;s City Council passed a living wage ordinance</strong> </p>
<p>On Monday, New York&#8217;s City Council passed a living wage ordinance, reports Good Jobs New York&#8217;s Bettina Damiani. The 45-5 vote means the Council can easily override a threatened veto by Mayor Michael Bloomberg (New York Post, May 1, via Nexis subscription service).</p>
<p>As I analyzed in Competing for Capital, the Living Wage movement attempts to reform, rather than abolish, economic development subsidies. The basic idea is the same as performance requirements in international investment negotiations, i.e., that a company that receives subsidies has to provide additional benefits to the city providing those incentives. As its name suggest, the most common demand is that subsidized firms have to pay a specified wage that is higher than the usual minimum wage. According to Living Wage NYC, over 140 cities in the U.S. have living wage ordinances, and the idea has spread to the U.K., Canada, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>In New York&#8217;s case, the law specifies that companies receiving at least $1 million in subsidies must pay $10/hour if they provide health benefits, or $11.50/hour otherwise. This is not a lot of money in New York City, yet a study by the Fiscal Policy Institute, Good Jobs New York, and the National Employment Law Project found multiple cases where subsidized projects paid even less, such as the Bronx Gateway Mall, which the study found had starting wages of $8.80 per hour. According to the study, the city spends over $2 billion annually on economic development incentives.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Mayor Bloomberg blasted the measure as a &#8220;jobs killer,&#8221; language reminiscent of minimum wage critics. We should remember that, according to Paul Krugman (Conscience of a Liberal) recent studies of the minimum wage do not uphold the long-claimed negative effects of the minimum wage on jobs. In fact, work beginning with that of David Card and Alan Krueger (now the chair of the Council of Economic Advisers) deftly picked apart previous studies in a process known as meta-analysis.</p>
<p>The biggest drawback to the New York law is that it was narrowly drawn by Council Speaker (and probable mayoral candidate) Christine Quinn in order to appease business interests. In fact, according to the Post story, it would affect &#8220;at least 600 employees a year,&#8221; which is hardly a big number in New York. But we can count on advocates to try to expand its scope in the next few years.</p>

<p>Whiny Apple Pioneered Avoidance Strategies, Books Fictional Tax Rates </p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t yet seen <i>The New York Times</i> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/29/business/apples-tax-strategy-aims-at-low-tax-states-and-nations.html?_r=4&#038;pagewanted=1&#038;hp">article on Apple</a>, go read it. I&#8217;ll wait. It&#8217;s a blockbuster.<br />    <br /><a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/apple-whines-about-having-to-pay-taxes.html">As I wrote last month</a>, Apple whines about the fact that it has to pay taxes. But of course, it does much more than whine. It sets up subsidiaries in tax haven states like Nevada to avoid U.S. state taxes, and establishes foreign tax haven subsidiaries in order to avoid U.S. and other government&#8217;s taxes. Then, through the magic of <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-transfer-pricing-hurts-middle-class.html">transfer pricing</a>, profits made in high-tax jurisdictions becomes taxable only in Nevada, Ireland, Luxembourg, etc. <i>The Times</i> reports estimates by <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/134tn0777.pdf">Martin Sullivan</a> that this saves Apple $2.4 billion a year in U.S. federal taxes alone, not to mention what it save in U.S. states or foreign countries. This is a conservative estimate, based on only 50% of its profits being due to U.S. operations. A more realistic 70% allocation of profits to the U.S. would mean that Apple&#8217;s federal tax bill would be $4.8 billion higher, according to Sullivan.    </p>
<p>Based on extensive interviews with former Apple executives as well as accountants for other firms, Charles Duhigg and David Kocieniewski show that not only does the company practice extensive legal avoidance of its taxes, but that the firm pioneered several of the most important tax avoidance techniques out there:<br />
<blockquote>Apple, for instance, was among the first tech companies to designate overseas salespeople in high-tax countries in a manner that allowed them to sell on behalf of low-tax subsidiaries on other continents, sidestepping income taxes, according to former executives. Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the “Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich,” which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean. Today, that tactic is used by hundreds of other corporations — some of which directly imitated Apple’s methods, say accountants at those companies. </p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Not only that: Apple paid, according to <i>The Times</i> article, $3.3 billion in &#8220;cash taxes&#8221; on its $34.2 billion of worldwide profits, for a 9.8% tax rate, as opposed to the $8.3 billion the company&#8217;s 10-K report said it paid. As the article notes:  <br />
<blockquote>“The information on 10-Ks is fiction for most companies,” said Kimberly Clausing, an economist at Reed College who specializes in multinational taxation. “But for tech companies it goes from fiction to farcical.” </p></blockquote>
<p>Some commenters on my article last month actually cited these 10-K figures as proof that nothing was amiss at Apple. As it turns out, the company&#8217;s reporting has other major gaps. Its<a href="http://investor.apple.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1193125-11-282113&#038;CIK=320193"> 2011 10-K Annual Report</a> states that it has only two &#8220;significant&#8221; foreign subsidiaries, both based in Ireland. Apparently its Luxembourg subsidiary &#8212; with over $1 billion in 2011 sales, according to <i>The Times</i> &#8212; is not significant. Nor are its subsidiaries in the Netherlands and the British Virgin Islands, despite their importance in keeping Apple&#8217;s worldwide taxes low. Because Apple only deems its Irish subsidiaries &#8220;significant&#8221; and does not report on any others&#8217; existence, the <a href="http://www.gao.gov/assets/290/284522.pdf">Government Accountability Office report</a> of 2008 on tax haven subsidiaries was misled into saying that the company had only one such subsidiary. We can only wonder how many other tax haven subsidiaries are omitted from companies&#8217; SEC filings.<br />  <br />Here&#8217;s the kicker: Even &#8220;cash taxes&#8221; is not a figure that accurately represents a given year&#8217;s tax payments, according to <i>The Times</i>.   </p>
<p>As Richard Murphy <a href="http://www.taxresearch.org.uk/Blog/2012/04/29/if-we-had-country-by-country-reporting-wed-know-where-apple-wasnt-paying-tax/?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed:+org/lWWh+%28Tax+Research+UK+2%29">points out</a>, while Apple&#8217;s tax strategy is no doubt all legal (&#8220;perfectly legal,&#8221; as in the title of David Cay Johnston&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Perfectly-Legal-Campaign-Benefit-Everybody/dp/1591840198">great book</a>), &#8220;It&#8217;s also profoundly unethical.&#8221; Apple largely rejects its duty to help pay for living in a civilized society, even as state (like its home of California) and national governments flounder with debt. Its behavior forces one or more of three outcomes, as I have written many times before: shifting the tax burden to others, more government debt, or program cutbacks. Apple&#8217;s behavior shows that it&#8217;s clearly okay with that.  </p>
<p>The solution starts with Murphy&#8217;s innovative &#8220;country-by-country&#8221; reporting, which does not require the tax havens to cooperate because all the information would be supplied by the company. Then, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-to-tackle-tax-havens.html">as I noted in November</a>, we need worldwide unitary taxation to strip out the artificiality of companies&#8217; allocation of assets and profits. We could treat Apple&#8217;s (and Microsoft&#8217;s, and&#8230;) &#8220;ownership&#8221; of patents in Ireland as the fiction it is, and force these companies to pay their fair share of taxes.   </p>

<p><strong>Social Security Hurt by Republican Jobs Obstructionism</strong></p>
<p>The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) published its <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/data-bytes/social-security-bytes/recession-weak-economy-behind-revision-of-social-securitys-projected-shortfall-to-2033">commentary</a> on Monday&#8217;s release of the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2012/index.html">Social Security Trustees Report</a>, which found that the Social Security trust fund would be exhausted in 2033. CEPR rightly blames the recession for the deterioration of Social Security&#8217;s finances. <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/increase-in-uninsured-rate-shows-need.html">As I argued last September</a> with regard to falling health care coverage, the new results from the Trustees show the need for a jobs agenda.</p>
<p>In fact, in just four years, the estimated trust fund exhaustion date (intermediate assumption) has gotten eight years closer. It was 2041 in the <a href="https://www.socialsecurity.gov/pressoffice/pr/trustee08-pr.htm">2008 report</a>, 2037 in the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2009/index.html">2009 report</a>, 2037 in the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2010/index.html">2010 report</a>, and 2036 in the <a href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2011/index.html">2011 report</a>. Jared Bernstein <a href="http://jaredbernsteinblog.com/moving-exhaustion/">charts these trends</a> going back to 1985:</p>

<p>The CEPR analysis highlights just how crucial jobs are to Social Security&#8217;s solvency:<br />
<blockquote>As workers have found themselves without jobs, Social Security has received fewer contributions. The 2007 Trustees&#8217; Report projected 169.0 million workers in 2011 earning $6.5 trillion in taxable earnings. Last year, there were only 157.7 million workers earning $5.5 trillion.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, there was a $1 trillion shortfall of income in 2011 alone compared to the pre-recession baseline. If this doesn&#8217;t highlight the need for much greater action on the jobs front, nothing does.<br />   <br />Yet what is the Republican response to this situation? At the federal level, there has been universal opposition to anything that might create more jobs as long as Obama is President. At the state and local level, as Paul Krugman points out, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/23/opinion/krugman-the-amnesia-candidate.html?_r=1">70% of the decline in public sector jobs</a> has come in Texas and in the states where Republicans took control of government in 2010.    </p>
<p>What we see from the Trustees Report is that as jobs and income decline, Social Security is directly harmed. And I&#8217;m starting to have the feeling that for the Republicans, this is a feature, not a bug.  crossposted with <a href="http://www.blogger.com/middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Middle Class Political Economist</a></p>

<p>Greg Mankiw doesn&#8217;t understand competitio​n for investment</p>
<p>Greg Mankiw&#8217;s <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/business/competition-is-good-for-governments-too-economic-view.html?_r=3&#038;ref=business" target="_blank">column</a> in Sunday&#8217;s New York Times makes the case that competition between governments is a good thing, that it makes them more efficient in the same way that competition among firms does. He paints it as also being about choosing re-distributionist policies or not, with <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/04/i-see-no-way-to-read-this-from-greg-mankiw-other-than-as-the-strongest-possible-endorsement-of-obama-and-the-democrats.html" target="_blank">Brad DeLong</a> and <a href="http://botc.tcf.org/2012/04/greg-mankiw-gives-pretty-good-argument-for-other-side.html" target="_blank">Harold Pollack</a> both ably making the case that of course governments should engage in redistribution.</p>
<p>As author of <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Competing_for_capital.html?id=cEt3Vn3H6sUC" target="_blank">Competing for Capital</a>, however, I am more interested in the question of whether government competition for investment leads to more efficient outcomes. The answer, in short, is that it does not. Indeed, competition for investment leads to economic inefficiency, heightened income inequality, and rent-seeking behavior by firms (a further cause ofinefficiency).</p>
<p>Mankiw claims:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;competition among governments leads to better governance. In choosing where to live, people can compare public services and taxes. They are attracted to towns that use tax dollars wisely&#8230;.The argument applies not only to people but also to capital. Because capital is more mobile than labor, competition among governments significantly constrains how capital is taxed. Corporations benefit from various government services, including infrastructure, the protection of property rights and the enforcement of contracts. But if taxes vastly exceed these benefits, businesses can – and often – move to places offering a better mix of tax and services.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mankiw doesn&#8217;t stop to think about what this competition looks like in the real world. To attract mobile capital, immobile governments offer a dizzying array of fiscal, financial, and regulatory incentives to companies in sums that have been growing over time for U.S. state and local governments, as I document in <i>Competing for Capital and Investment Incentives and the Global Competition for Capital</i>. His discussion centers on the reduction of corporate income tax rates, which is surely a part of the competition, but which is no longer an issue when an individual firm is negotiating with an individual government.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />At that level, the issues then become more concrete: Can we keep our employees&#8217; state withholding tax? Can we get out of paying taxes every other company has to pay? Will you give us a cash grant? The list goes on and on. As governments make varying concessions on these issues, you then begin to see the consequences: discrimination among firms (especially to the detriment of small business); overuse and mis-location of capital as subsidies distort investment decisions; a more unequal post-tax, post-subsidy distribution of income than would have existed in the absence of incentive use (a corollary of the fact noted by Mankiw that &#8220;capital is more mobile than labor&#8221;); and at times the subsidization of environmentally harmful projects. Moreover, many location incentives are actually relocation incentives, paying companies at times over $100 million to move across a state line while staying in the same metropolitan area, with no economic benefit for the region or the country as a whole (Cerner-OnGoal, now in Kansas rather than Kansas City, is a good case in point).</p>
<p>Once upon a time, about 50 years ago in this country, companies made their investment decisions based on their best estimate of the economic case for various locations without requesting subsidies. On the rare occasion when a company did ask for government support, it was at levels that would appear quaint today. For example, when Chrysler built its Belvidere, Illinois, assembly plant in the early 1960s, it asked for the city to run a sewer line out to the facility&#8211;and it even lent the city the money to do it.</p>
<p>Today, companies have learned that the site location decision is a great opportunity to extract rents from immobile governments, and invest considerable resources into doing just that. An entire industry has sprung up to take advantage of businesses&#8217; informational advantages over governments&#8211;and, indeed, intensify that asymmetry&#8211;to make rent extraction as effective (not &#8220;efficient&#8221;!) as possible.</p>
<p>Finally, let&#8217;s reflect on the force that makes this process happen, capital mobility. The fact that capital has far greater ability to move geographically than labor does, and that governments of course are geographically bound to one place, is a source of power for owners of capital. Modern economists, especially conservatives and libertarians, often have great difficulty acknowledging the role of power in market transactions, though their ostensible hero, Adam Smith, did not. To treat this power as a natural phenomenon rather than a social one, as Mankiw does, is dangerously close to saying that might makes right. But that&#8217;s not the way things are supposed to work in a democratic society, or a moral one.</p>
