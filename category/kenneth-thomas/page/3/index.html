<p>It&#8217;s the Middle Class, Stupid! (Review)</p>
<p>When I saw that James Carville and Stan Greenberg had just published <i>It&#8217;s the Middle Class, Stupid!</i> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Middle-Class-Stupid-James-Carville/dp/0399160396">Blue Rider Press</a>), I knew that I would want to read it. I had always liked Carville&#8217;s <i>We&#8217;re Right, They&#8217;re Wrong</i> and wanted to know his take on approaching the declining fortunes of the middle class.<br />    <br />While this book includes some diagnosis of the problems and has a very detailed and very good set of policy proposals, primarily it is a work on political strategy. Based on polling and focus groups the authors have conducted over the last several years (as well as their long experience running campaigns and polling), Carville and Greenberg analyze what they consider some of the political failures of the Obama Administration, particularly with regards to messaging.<br />     <br />For example, they argue that Americans are not persuaded by Team Obama&#8217;s continuing emphasis on the fact that the President inherited a mess from the Bush Administration (Chapter 11). Although voters place much of the blame for the Great Recession on President Bush, Greenberg reports that his focus groups reacted very negatively to President Obama&#8217;s car-in-the-ditch metaphor (&#8220;I&#8217;m still in the ditch!&#8221; many told Greenberg) and the participants expressed strong opinions that we needed to look forward, not backward.    </p>
<p>As one said, &#8220;[Obama] is trying to say things are turning around, but the numbers are still bad.&#8221; The premature declaration of victory by the Administration described here has been strongly criticized by <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/09/was-failure-inevitable/">Paul Krugman</a>, among others. Economically effective policy is the best talking point. Carville and Greenberg also give a compelling litany of sophisticated responses to even &#8220;good&#8221; job creation news on pp. 103-7.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The second big, non-obvious, point is that Americans really are concerned about the deficit and debt (Chapter 8). Again, even though they recognize the role of the Bush tax cuts and unfunded wars in creating that debt, they are still leery about the possibility of spending our way to more economic growth, though not by huge majorities. Too many of them are convinced of the false analogy between households and governments, although Paul Krugman is doing his best to convince them with his new book, <a href="http://books.wwnorton.com/books/978-0-393-08877-9/"><i>End This Depression Now!</i></a> The framing the authors found most persuasive to middle class voters was an emphasis on &#8220;investments that will get our country back on track.&#8221; Tellingly, as Carville and Greenberg note, their respondents did not see the debt as a reason to cut Social Security or Medicare.<br />    <br />Third, but more obvious, middle class voters don&#8217;t see government as the solution because they consider it to be captured by elite interests. The focus groups showed that this view led to some tendency to paralysis and disengagement from politics. It is from this point that Carville and Greenberg pivot to their most important policy recommendation: Amend the Constitution or obtain a Supreme Court that will overturn <i>Citizens United</i> and end corporate personhood. In addition, they call for public financing of elections, disclosure of campaign contributions, requiring broadcasters to cut the price of political ads, and ending the revolving door of office holders and lobbyists. All this is in support of a politics that makes rebuilding the middle class Job 1 for government, and for a consistent framing of all issues (including foreign policy) in terms of their impact on the middle class.<br />    <br />Not everything in the book is persuasive. At one point Greenberg says the popularity of raising taxes on the rich &#8220;is as close to an absolute truth you can have in polling&#8221; (p. 144). I have two problems with this. First, you could say the same thing for other industrialized democracies. <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Taxation_and_Democracy.html?id=gAML_smYeHIC">Sven Steinmo</a>, writing in the early 1990s, has cited polling results for the U.S., U.K., and Sweden, all of which showed publics that thought the rich should pay more taxes, yet in none of these cases has that been the direction of policy over the last 30 years. To me, this suggests there is an international dimension that helped make government capture possible, but the book does not address globalization very much at all.<br />    <br />Second, the book devotes relatively little attention to another issue that also is overwhelmingly supported in <a href="http://nelpaction.wordpress.com/2012/01/12/bloomberg-calls-to-raise-new-yorks-minimum-wage-reaffirming-political-economic-popularity-of-wage-increase/">poll after poll</a>: raising the minimum wage. Yes, making work pay is an important theme in the book and the authors acknowledge that increasing the minimum wage is part of that, but they say nothing about how putting the issue on many state ballots helped increase Democratic turnout in 2006. In Missouri, for example, the minimum wage <a href="http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Missouri_Minimum_Wage_Act,_Proposition_B_%282006%29">Proposition B passed by a 76-24 margin</a>, helping Claire McCaskill squeak out a U.S. Senate win with less than 50% of the vote.<br />    <br />The other weakness of the book is that the authors are too close to President Clinton to give a completely objective view of his Presidency. While they make a single parenthetical reference about how NAFTA may not have been such a great idea for the middle class after all, they say nothing about how &#8220;ending welfare as we know it&#8221; was bad for the middle class. This can best be seen by thinking about income determination as a massive bargaining situation. Anything that takes away one side&#8217;s options reduces its bargaining power, and the 1996 welfare reform did just that. In addition, they seem blind to the fact that income inequality (top 1% vs. the 20th-80th percentiles) took off during the Clinton Administration far in excess of what had been seen under President Reagan, as a glance at their chart on p. 52 shows.<br />    <br />Finally, the book has no index, which is very annoying when you have 296 pages of text and 25 pages of endnotes.<br />    <br />Those caveats aside, this is a very good book that deserves a careful reading by progressive activists. I certainly learned something from it, and I&#8217;m sure you will, too.</p>

<p>New Estimate of Offshore Wealth Shows Big Increase Since 2004</p>
<p>A <a href="http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/upload/pdf/Price_of_Offshore_Revisited_120722.pdf">new report</a> by the <a href="http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/front_content.php?idcat=148">Tax Justice Network</a>, &#8220;The Price of Offshore Revisited,&#8221; shows that the amount of wealth held in tax havens has increased enormously since 2004, and confirms <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/tax-havens-cost-middle-class-untold.html">what I previously wrote</a> about the huge cost to tax coffers of money hidden offshore.    </p>
<p>The report was authored by the former Chief Economist of McKinsey and Company, James Henry. Its findings advance our understanding of tax havens and demonstrate that typical estimates of wealth inequality are significantly understated.    </p>
<p>The major finding is that offshore financial holdings now come to some $21-32 trillion, compared with the estimate in <a href="http://www.richard.murphy.dial.pipex.com/ThePriceofOffshore.pdf">TJN&#8217;s 2005 report</a> of $9.5 trillion (this excludes non-financial wealth, such as real estate). James makes a <i>very</i> conservative estimate of how much governments lose in taxes of $189 billion a year, based on earning just 3% on this $21 trillion, taxed at 30%. How conservative? This is actually less than the $255 billion annually estimated in the first TJN report, but that is based on earning 7.5% annually on offshore wealth. We can get an idea of how conservative this estimate of lost taxes by seeing how sensitive it is to changing the rate of return and wealth estimate used:    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Rate of Return Wealth Estimate Lost Taxes    <br />3% $21 Trillion $189 billion (Henry&#8217;s actual estimate)    <br />4% $21 Trillion $252 billion    <br />5% $21 Trillion $315 billion    <br />6% $21 Trillion $378 billion    <br />3% $32 Trillion $288 billion    <br />4% $32 Trillion $384 billion    <br />5% $32 Trillion $480 billion    <br />6% $32 Trillion $576 billion    </p>
<p>Note that none of these hypothetical estimates use an earnings rate for offshore wealth as high as the original TJN report&#8217;s 7.5%.    </p>
<p>Since these assets are hidden, we of course have no way of knowing how much the money is earning. I think it is fair to say that Henry&#8217;s estimate is more likely low than high.    </p>
<p>On the inequality of financial wealth, Henry says:<br />
<blockquote>By our estimates, at least a third of all private financial wealth, and nearly half of all offshore wealth, is now owned by world&#8217;s richest 91,000 people &#8211; just 0.001% of the world&#8217;s population. The next 51 percent of all wealth is owned by the next 8.4 million, another trivial 0.14% of the world&#8217;s population.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the companion report on inequality by Nicholas Shaxson et al., <a href="http://taxjustice.blogspot.co.uk/">the authors asked</a> a number of well-known experts on inequality if they thought these data showed inequality has been underestimated. The answer from Thomas Piketty (of Piketty and Saez, the most widely quoted set of papers on inequality that I know of) was blunt: &#8220;Yes, definitely.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Despite<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/07/23/how-not-to-report-on-the-poor-and-the-wealthy/"> Felix Salmon&#8217;</a>s characterization of the report as &#8220;long on hyperbole,&#8221; I find no reason to disagree with its conclusion that tax havens are a &#8220;black hole,&#8221; one which costs the middle class (through uncollected taxes on the super-rich) untold billions of dollars and increases inequality around the world.</p>

<p>U.S. Trails at Least 15 OECD Countries in Median Wealth </p>
<p>Via @exiledonline, I learned today (July 18) that Canadians are richer than Americans. This is rather surprising, since GDP per capita is higher in the U.S than in Canada.: $48,100 vs. $40,300 (at purchasing power parity or PPP), according to the <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html">CIA World Factbook</a>. But in fact things are much worse than that, as 15 OECD countries (plus Singapore and Taiwan) have higher median wealth than the U.S. does. There may even be more, as the Credit Suisse report I discuss below does not give median wealth data for several countries with higher mean wealth than the U.S.    </p>
<p>Most reporting has been based on a story that was run in the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/commentary/canadians-are-richer-than-they-think/article4380634/">June 30th <i>Globe and Mail</i></a> claiming that average (mean) Canadian household wealth had reached $363,202 vs. just under $320,000 in the U.S. This is not a particularly informative statistic, however, since wealth is even more unevenly distributed than income, and income in the U.S. is already highly unequally distributed. What we really need is median net worth, i.e. the level at the exact middle of the net worth distribution in a country. G&#038;M commenter &#8220;TJMone&#8221; picks up that point, receiving an answer from &#8220;porkbarrel pundit&#8221;: a <a href="https://infocus.credit-suisse.com/data/_product_documents/_shop/324292/2011_global_wealth_report_databook.pdf">Credit Suisse report</a> from October 2011 (via <a href="http://lsminsurance.ca/life-insurance-canada/2011/12/canadas-net-worth-tops-the-united-states">LSM Insurance</a>), shows that the median net worth per adult in Canada was $89,014, compared to just $52,752 in the U.S. (all figures in U.S. dollars).    </p>
<p>American reporting based on the study in the G&#038;M did not start until 18 days later, when <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2012/07/18/for-the-first-time-canadians-now-richer-than-americans">an article</a> in <i>U.S. News &#038; World Report</i> picked it up (Canadians are right: no one in the U.S. is paying attention to them). Moreover, no one picked up on the much better data in the Credit Suisse report until later in the day, when <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/07/18/are-canadians-richer-than-americans/">Dylan Matthews</a> at Wonkblog wrote a great story on it (there are many high-quality comments, too). It turns out that lots of OECD countries, including economic basket cases Italy, Spain, and Ireland, have higher median wealth than we do. See the chart below:</p>
<p><img alt="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/07/medianwealth.jpg" height="480" src="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/files/2012/07/medianwealth.jpg" width="640"><br />Source: Dylan Matthews, based on data from Credit Suisse    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>It is mind boggling that median Australian net wealth per adult is four times that of the U.S., and Italy is three times as high. Ireland and Spain, meanwhile, are also higher despite having housing busts similar to that in the United States. What is going on here?    </p>
<p>Part of the answer is more equal income distribution. According to the Credit Suisse report, mean wealth per adult is just shy of 5 times median wealth in the U.S., whereas in Canada it&#8217;s a little less than a 3:1 ratio (see Table 7-1). Other countries with higher median but lower mean net worth per adult are Taiwan, Finland, Germany, Ireland, Israel, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Spain. Australia has a higher mean net worth than the U.S., but its ratio of mean to median net worth per adult is less than 2:1.    </p>
<p>Another part of the answer may be that in many other wealthy countries, households have less debt. If you remember <a href="http://sickothemovie.com/">Michael Moore&#8217;s movie</a> <i>Sicko</i>, in one scene he interviews an upper-middle class French family and asks them what debt they have. Their only significant debt is their mortgage, because they didn&#8217;t have to take out loans to go to college. The Credit Suisse report finds this pattern (unfortunately, only mean debt, not median debt). Mean debt per adult (see Table 2-4) is $59,362 in 2011 for the United States, whereas for France it is $40,873, Germany $33,424, and Italy only $24,291. Of course, this isn&#8217;t true of all countries: Ireland and Switzerland both have much higher mean debt per adult, but they also have about twice the median wealth per adult of the U.S.    </p>
<p>This analysis is hardly exhaustive; I bet a good book could be written on the subject.    </p>
<p>One final point: Matthews skewers the claim by <i>Globe and Mail</i> author Michael Adams (whose firm conducted the study discussed in his article) and later commenters on both sides of the border who accepted Adams&#8217; claim that this was a historical first. As he shows with U.S. and Canadian government data, Canada&#8217;s median household net worth was significantly higher in 2004-5, before the crisis, than here in the U.S. Given the huge disparities between the United States and some of the other countries, it is likely that net worth per adult has been higher in a number of these countries for quite some time. These data reflect trends that have been developing for a long time, and are not purely driven by the economic crisis or by any single set of policies. But they make for sobering reading, and deserve more than the superficial analysis most of the U.S. press has given them so far. Bravo to Matthews for a great piece of analysis.</p>

<p>Alabama&#8217;s Airbus Subsidy Eerily Reminiscent of Auto &#8220;Transplants&#8221;</p>
<p>The July 2 announcement that Airbus would begin assembly of its A-320 airliner in Mobile, Alabama, may be good for Alabama, but whether it&#8217;s good for the country as a whole is dubious. Indeed, it most reminds me of the subsidized arrival of foreign auto &#8220;transplants&#8221; that helped undermine Detroit&#8217;s Big 3 as well as the unionization of the auto industry.</p>
<p>The new $600 million facility is projected to create 1000 jobs. Initial reports put subsidies to the company as <a href="http://blog.al.com/live/2012/07/state_local_incentives_of_near.html">$158.5 million</a> from the state and various local governments (thanks to @varnergreg for pointing out this article). Remember, though, that initial reports are more likely to underestimate subsidies than overestimate them, as in the case of <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/wooing-of-electrolux-by-memphis.html">Electrolux in Memphis</a>. However, if this is remotely near accurate, Alabama got a much better deal for Airbus than did Washington state for the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, which was 220% of the investment and $1.65 million per job (according to my calculations for <a href="http://us.macmillan.com/investmentincentivesandtheglobalcompetitionforcapital/KennethPThomas"><i>Investment Incentives and the Global Competition for Capital</i></a>), more than 10 times the per job cost in Alabama.    </p>
<p>Unfortunately, this development could repeat the example of the subsidization of foreign automakers that hastened the decline of Detroit&#8217;s Big Three. According to economic geographer <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/The_Changing_Us_Auto_Industry.html?id=zqpbKPwzm5wC">James Rubenstein</a> (1992, Table 1.1), from 1979 to 1991 there was a 1 to 1 correspondence in the opening and closing of new automobile and truck assembly plants in the U.S. and Canada: 20 new ones were built, 20 old ones were closed. Every one of the new facilities received subsidies from state and local (or federal and provincial, in Canada) governments. Given that the automobile industry was in a position of overcapacity for much of that period, it is no surprise that new production simply displaced older production.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Will the same thing now happen in the aircraft industry? Globally, Airbus has been <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/592001-boeing-vs-airbus-orders-and-profits">putting market share above profits </a>since the early 2000s. With its current move to Alabama, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/03/business/global/eads-to-build-airbus-assembly-line-in-mobile-ala.html">CEO Fabrice Brégier</a> said the company hoped to grow its U.S. market share for single-aisle planes (the A-320 competes mainly with the Boeing 737) from 17% to 50% over the next 20 years. If Airbus is successful, it would be bad for the <a href="http://www.boeing.com/aboutus/employment/employment_table.html">80,000+ employees</a> in Boeing&#8217;s Commercial Airplanes group.</p>
<p>Of course, there is growing global demand for airliners, especially in Asia. <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/592001-boeing-vs-airbus-orders-and-profits">But China has already developed its own competitor in the single-aisle market and Airbus is building A-320s in Tianjin, China</a>, making it unclear how much of the global growth can translate into increased U.S. employment.    </p>
<p>As was the case with foreign automakers, this is a case where a market-seeking investment was clearly coming to the United States, but the competition for the facility allowed Airbus to extract rents through the site selection process. By repeating this process for projects large and small, state and local governments deprive themselves of <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/07/subsidy-cuts-could-reduce-big-part-of.html">as much as $70 billion per year</a> in revenue, enough to hire all state and local employees laid off since the recession began in December 2007. At the same time, over the long haul, the process in the auto industry replaced well-paid unionized workers with less well-paid, non-union workers. The prospect that this evolution could be repeated in the aircraft industry is a pretty depressing one, when all is said and done. </p>

<p>What is Mitt Romney Hiding? </p>
<p>Mitt Romney has so far released <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/01/jon-stewart-delivers-goods-on-mitt.html">only one year</a> of tax returns (2010), plus an estimate for 2011. This stands in stark contrast to his father, Michigan Governor George Romney, who released 12 years of tax returns when he began running for President in 1967. As his father said at the time, &#8220;One year could be a fluke.&#8221; So the questions remain about what is in Romney&#8217;s older returns.<br />    <br />Two stories this week and last have ratcheted up the pressure. One is a recent web exclusive for &#8220;The Last Word with Laurence O&#8217;Donnell&#8221; where <a href="http://thelastword.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/27/12444118-questions-linger-over-romneys-tax-history">David Cay Johnston</a> has five questions for Romney that can only be answered with his tax returns. The other is a <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/08/investigating-mitt-romney-offshore-accounts">blockbuster story</a> by Nicholas Shaxson (h/t <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entries/vanity-fair-looks-into-romneys-offshore-finances">TPM</a>) in the new <i>Vanity Fair</i> on the shadowy world of Romney&#8217;s tax havens. Together, they put a laser-like focus on the finances of the man who could become our 45th President.<br />    <br />Johnston is a well-known former <i>New York Times</i> reporter, Pulitzer Prize winner, and the author of the major books <i>Perfectly Legal</i> and <i>Free Lunch</i>. If you don&#8217;t have time to watch his 3:45 video, here are the five questions:<br />    <br />&#8220;1. Did you buy any illegal or gray area tax shelters?    <br />&#8220;2. Did an IRS audit ever uncover serious problems with any of your tax returns?    <br />&#8220;3. Did you make use of offshore vehicles to defer, or avoid paying, federal income taxes?    <br />&#8220;4. Did you take advantage of any tax strategies that the IRS did not uncover in audits?    <br />&#8220;5. Did you fully tithe to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints every year and take a deduction on your tax return that shows that?&#8221;    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>These are important questions. We know that Governor Romney has had a Swiss bank account, as well as money in <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/05/obama-campaign-maps-romneys-tax-havens.html">other tax havens</a> like the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg, Bermuda, and Ireland. Romney&#8217;s answer to any question about his taxes has basically been, &#8220;Trust me.&#8221; But the guy&#8217;s running for President, <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/10/mitt_romney_im_running_for_office_for_petes_sake_i_cant_have_illegals.php">for Pete&#8217;s sake</a>. He owes us more than that.<br />    <br />Shaxson, a researcher for the <a href="http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/front_content.php?idcatart=2&#038;lang=1">Tax Justice Network</a> and author of the book <a href="http://treasureislands.org/"><i>Treasure Islands</i></a>, asks us to consider the possibility that maybe not everything Romney has done tax-wise has been legal. He opens with a story told by a former Bain employee about how Romney encouraged him to lie to get secret information on competitors. There is, of course, the fact that Romney has funds parked in numerous tax havens and the fact that his supposedly &#8220;blind&#8221; trust invested in a business started by Romney&#8217;s son Tagg, and the fact that he has $102 million in his IRA despite a contribution limit of $2000 per year for the entire 15 years Romney ran Bain. Obviously nothing to see here&#8230;<br />    <br />The standard answer of the Romney campaign to all this is that he always followed the law. As <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/01/jon-stewart-delivers-goods-on-mitt.html">Jon Stewart</a> had to point out since the major media did not, Romney did plenty to affect the law he was supposedly &#8220;just following,&#8221; including his defense of the &#8220;covered interest&#8221; tax loophole that let him treat his fees at Bain as if they were capital gains (15% tax) rather than wages (35% tax). All perfectly legal and as Johnston points out in his book by that name, that is the real scandal.<br />    <br />Further, Shaxson reveals that an early filing of the original Bain Capital fund in 1984 showed that many of its foreign investors were routed through tax havens and that at least one was a notorious financial criminal, Robert Maxwell. Thus, Bain helped foreigners take advantage of the fact that the United States has set itself up as a tax haven for non-citizens (see also <a href="http://www.relooney.info/0_New_8887.pdf">Jason Sharman&#8217;s paper</a> on setting up anonymous companies in the U.S. and elsewhere; h/t <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/67ti0069.pdf">Robert Kudrle</a>). Shaxson quotes Rebecca Wilkins of Citizens for Tax Justice, “It is shocking that a presidential candidate should think that is O.K.” for Bain to service the likes of Robert Maxwell.<br />    <br />The bottom line is that there is a lot of unsettling information in what investigators have so far been able to piece together about Romney&#8217;s finances. The easiest way for Governor Romney to put to rest what his campaign described to Shaxson as &#8220;unfounded allegations and insinuations&#8221; would be to release his tax returns. Yet he has not done so and shows no sign of changing his mind. <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/07/ill_just_say_it_i.php?ref=fpblg">Josh Marshall</a> calls the questions &#8220;kryptonite&#8221; and thinks Romney will come under a lot of pressure to release more tax returns. Let&#8217;s hope so. The guy&#8217;s running for President, for Pete&#8217;s sake. </p>

                                <p>There is and will be a lot of conversation about the efficacy of the ACA (Affordable Care Act), whether it is a step to deal with the health care cost juggernaut or mostly a boon to private insurers.  What is true is that &#8216;medical inflation&#8217; has resumed to previous levels of year to year increase after a lull during the last two years, except for Medicare, which comes in at about 3% and not the 9% for the commercial market.

<p>Thursday&#8217;s health care ruling was a surprising victory for the middle class. I went to bed Wednesday dreading waking up, only to be awakened by a phone call that the law had been upheld. Most of the story is well-known, and summarized in <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2012/06/28/remarks-president-supreme-court-ruling-affordable-care-act">the President&#8217;s speech</a>: six million young adults under 26 who have gained insurance, children now (and adults starting in 2014) can no longer be denied insurance due to pre-existing conditions, an end to terminating people&#8217;s insurance when they get ill, closing the Medicare donut hole, etc. I want to focus on one provision the President mentioned in passing, the $1.1 billion in insurance rebates that 12.8 million Americans will be receiving August 1.    </p>
<p>The rebates are due to the medical loss ratio or &#8220;80/20&#8221; rule that insurance companies cannot spend more than 20% of premium dollars on &#8220;administration, CEO pay, and profits,&#8221; as <a href="http://healthcareforamericanow.org/2012/06/21/1-1-billion-mlr-rebates-to-consumers/">Health Care for America Now</a> (HCAN) summarizes it. The requirement is 85% spent on actual medical care for firms in the large group market, according to <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/resources/reports/mlr-rebates06212012a.html">healthcare.gov</a>.(via HCAN). Of the $1.1 billion in rebates, $393.9 million will be in the individual market, $386.4 million in the large group market, and $321.1 million in the small group market.    <br />Although $1.1 billion in rebates is not a lot of money in the multi-trillion U.S. health care system, it <i>is</i> enough to provide noticeable rebates to millions of consumer before the November election. <a href="http://yourhealthsecurity.org/health-insurance-refund-list-2011">Consumers Union</a> has a state-by-state breakdown of which insurance companies owe rebates in each state, and how much. Three patterns emerge from these data: First, some companies routinely failed to meet the 80/20 rule in state after state after state. Second, Blue Cross/Blue Shield companies, which were once largely non-profit but were converted to for-profit corporations mostly in the 1990s, are now frequent violators of the medical loss ratio rule. Third, some states, most notably Texas, have such lax insurance company regulations that violations of the rule are rampant. The data below come from the Consumers Union link above.    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>1) Multiple violations by individual companies: The poster child for gouging consumers and spending premium dollars on things other than health care is Golden Rule Insurance Company (since 2003 a subsidiary of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule_Insurance_Company">UnitedHealthcare</a>), which operates solely in the individual market, and not in either the small group or large group health care markets. According to the Consumers Union data, Golden Rule owes rebates in 23 states where it operates. Comparing the CU data with <a href="http://www.goldenrule.com/plans-by-state/">Golden Rule&#8217;s website</a> on where it operates, we find that in only nine states where it operates does it not owe rebates. We also learn that two Golden Rule subsidiaries also owe rebates, American Medical Security Life Insurance Company in Utah in the individual market, and Oxford Health Plans of New Jersey Inc. in the large employer market, bringing Golden Rule&#8217;s total to fully 25 states where it owes rebates under the medical loss ratio rule. In a number of states (Alabama, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Mississippi, and West Virginia) , Golden Rule owes more money than any other insurer in the individual market.    </p>
<p>Furthermore, UnitedHealthcare subsidiaries carrying the UHC name owe rebates in 28 states in the small business market, large business market, or both.    </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to single out UnitedHealthcare for overcharging: depending on the state and the market, Aetna, Connecticut General, and Time Insurance Company, among others, owe substantial rebates to their customers as well. But Golden Rule and UnitedHealthcare failed to meet their 80/20 tests in so many states that they really stand out.    </p>
<p>2) In many states in which Golden Rule does not owe the highest rebates in the individual market, Blue Cross/Blue Shield does. This includes states like Arizona, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Tennessee, and most notably, Texas. This represents a complete repudiation of the historical BC/BS ethos, which included non-profit incorporation and community rating (i.e., not penalizing people for getting sick). But that&#8217;s what happens when you turn non-profits into for-profits in health care.    </p>
<p>3) This brings us to lax insurance regulation, as in Texas. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Texas owes $89.9 million in refunds, all of it in the individual market, which by itself exceeds all the refunds in the much bigger California economy, where total refunds only <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/resources/reports/mlr-rebates06212012a.html">amount to $73.9 million</a>. Total rebates in Texas will total $167.0 million. The only other state with rebates exceeding $100 million this year is Florida, at $123.6 million. However, a number of states have higher average rebates, led by Vermont at $807. I believe both the total and average rebates should be examined for evidence of weak insurance regulation.    </p>
<p>To summarize, the Supreme Court&#8217;s decision was a great one for the middle class. On top of all the provisions that expand coverage and economic security, 12.8 million consumers will see refunds from their insurers to pay back for their price gouging.    </p>
<p>This is not to say that we don&#8217;t have a long way to go to complete health reform. As <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/28/opinion/carroll-health-supreme-court/index.html">Aaron Carroll</a> points out, there is a great deal more that needs to be done to our $2.7 trillion health system, including making coverage universal and getting cost increase under control. But upholding the Affordable Care Act is a step in the right direction. </p>

<p>Lost Output Over $3 Trillion And Rising </p>
<p>Still traveling, so just a quick post, but this really can&#8217;t be emphasized enough. Andrew Fieldhouse at the Economic Policy Institute <a href="http://www.epi.org/blog/failure-stimulate-recovery-costing-trillions/">reports</a> that the Congressional Budget Office now has cumulatively reduced its estimate of 2017 gross domestic product by 6.6% since the beginning of the recession in December 2007. As Fieldhouse points out, that doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but when it&#8217;s 6.6% of a $15 trillion economy, we are looking at about $1 trillion (with a &#8220;T&#8221;) of lost income in 2017. To put it another way, that is well over $3000 of income per person that year. That is on top of $3 trillion in potential GDP already lost since the recession began, according to Fieldhouse.    </p>
<p>The culprit, of course, is the lack of further stimulus to the economy. After the <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/05/on-the-inadequacy-of-the-stimulus/">totally inadequate</a> $800 billion stimulus package in 2009, we have had essentially nothing. At the end of 2011, Republicans <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-30/congress-passes-two-month-u-s-payroll-tax-cut-extension.html">had to be shamed</a> into approving a payroll tax cut they previously favored. Indeed, as Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institute and the Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute have pointed out, it is not the case that both parties are getting more partisan. As they put it, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just say it. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-30/congress-passes-two-month-u-s-payroll-tax-cut-extension.html">The Republicans are the problem</a>.&#8221; It is the Republicans in Congress who are blocking further stimulus measures. Electing a new Congress that will not pass a stimulus bill will cost Americans thousands of dollars out of their pockets.    </p>
<p>We are a long way away from <strike>George Wallace </strike>Will Roger&#8217;s famous claim that there was not &#8220;a dimes&#8217; worth of difference&#8221; between the two parties. </p>

<p>Guest post: Why the World Should Care About America&#8217;s Middle Class </p>
<p><a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/timworstall/2012/06/14/does-the-american-middle-class-benefit-from-globalisation-who-cares/?ss=strategies-solutions">Tim Worstall</a>, in his <i>Forbes</i> blog, attacks my series (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/06/is-globalization-good-for-america.html">here</a> and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/06/guest-post-is-globalization-good-for.html">here</a>) on whether globalization is good for America&#8217;s middle class. Not on the basis that he disagrees with my conclusion (though he does), but because, he argues, there are much more important facts about globalization than a decline in the economic well-being of the middle class in America and Europe. In particular, he points to the great decline in poverty among developing nations that have embraced globalization:<br />
<blockquote>This growth in incomes, in wealth, has been uneven, this is true. Largely speaking those places which have been taking part in globalisation, Indonesia, China, India, have been getting richer. Those that have not been, Somalia perhaps as an example, have not been.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s leave aside the fact that these successful countries are hardly poster children for the kinds of so-called &#8220;free-market&#8221; policies that Worstall espouses, a point made particularly well by <a href="http://dev.wcfia.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/Rodrick_HowToSave.pdf">Dani Rodrik</a>. And in the spirit in which Worstall granted my claims for the sake of argument, let&#8217;s grant his as well. (But if you want to get down into the weeds on the extent to which poverty reduction claims may be overstated, take a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&#038;rct=j&#038;q=&#038;esrc=s&#038;source=web&#038;cd=1&#038;ved=0CFQQFjAA&#038;url=http%3A%2F%2Fciteseerx.ist.psu.edu%2Fviewdoc%2Fdownload%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.131.1901%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf&#038;ei=JvvaT8f5FeKL2AXex-y1CA&#038;usg=AFQjCNHzCZL7pMbS21SuVfstm5bba2rNVg&#038;sig2=T1lGkVMos_JBJEjdoOnPGg">Robert Wade&#8217;s work</a>.)  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Here is the crux of Worstall&#8217;s argument:  <br />
<blockquote>So I would actually posit that whether the American, or European, or rich world, middle class benefits from globalisation is actually an incomplete question. Incomplete enough to be the wrong question. Almost to the point that the answer is “who cares?”.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>The correct question is what is the distribution of all of the costs and all of the benefits of globalisation? To which my answer would be that a generation, perhaps even two generations, of stagnating lifestyles for the already rich, those middle classes, looks like a reasonable enough cost to pay for the other thing that is happening: the abolition of absolute human poverty in the rest of the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>First, I think we should certainly care when hundreds of millions of people are suffering unnecessarily. Yes, unnecessarily, because contrary to Worstall&#8217;s claim, we are not trading off reduced economic well-being for hundreds of millions of middle class people for the lessened poverty of billions of other people. Indeed, the two are happening simultaneously, but as <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/4510.html">Ronald Rogowki</a> pointed out in <i>Commerce and Coalitions</i>, it is perfectly feasible to have rich country winners compensate rich-country losers and still have all of them be better off from trade.</p>
<p>Politically, it is a hard row to how, as Rogowki pointed out: the winners from expanding trade increase their political power as a result of their increased income, making compensatory policies less likely. But ending globalization&#8217;s harm to the middle class in rich nations does not <i>require</i> us to take anything away from poorer people, not if you accept the theory of comparative advantage and the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem. It <i>does</i> require us to figure out a political solution to the problems faced by the losers, which as we can see in the United States is made more difficult by the decline of unions and by the <i>Citizens United</i> Supreme Court decision.  </p>
<p>And second, we should care about the U.S. middle class (and Europe&#8217;s, for that matter) because how they react to their situation politically will have enormous consequences for the world economy and world politics. If the U.S. comes up with a &#8220;Smoot-Hawley&#8221; response to its economic problems, that would undo a lot of the gains Worstall sees as flowing from globalization, a point made recently by <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it">Dani Rodrik</a> (via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/06/links-for-06-14-2012.html">Mark Thoma</a>). Even more ominously, in both the U.S. and Europe, we see increasing political polarization and the rise of nationalist political parties and movements, as noted by <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/14/historical-echoes/">Paul Krugman</a>. Economic decline is a scary thing, and people&#8217;s reactions to it can get downright ugly, to put it mildly.  </p>
<p>For both of these reasons, then, what happens to the middle class in the U.S. and Europe will have repercussions far beyond those acknowledged by Worstall.   </p>

<p>Guest Post:   Is globalization good for America&#8217;s middle class? Part 2</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/">Part 1</a>, I examined what economic theory has to say about the winners and losers from trade. The main conclusion is based on the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem: Because the United States is labor scarce in a global perspective, an expansion of trade will reduce the real wages of labor. As we have seen, this theoretical prediction has been borne out as <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/basics-real-wages-remain-below-their.html">real wages remain below their peak</a> level for the 39th year running.<br />    <br />In this post, I analyze what I consider to be the other main element of globalization, the expansion of the mobility of capital. Just as transportation innovation and cost declines made trade easier, they also make it easier for owners of capital to locate it in a broader range of places than 30 or 40 years ago. Similarly, the decline in communication costs make it easier for owners of capital to coordinate production on a global scale as well as offering additional ways of moving financial capital (think <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/tax-havens-cost-middle-class-untold.html">tax havens</a>).<br />    <br />Note that I have said nothing about actual movements of capital. Simply the <i>ability</i> to move capital strengthens capital owners in their negotiations with business and labor, because it makes the threat of moving credible and thereby gives companies greater bargaining power. <a href="http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1018&#038;context=cbpubs">Kate Bronfenbrenner</a> showed clearly that after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1993, companies more frequently resorted to threats in their bargaining with workers, even to the point of violating the National Labor Relations Act by threatening to move during union organizing drives. In this blog, I have previously discussed the case of Boeing&#8217;s establishment of a <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/09/boeing-in-south-carolina-huge-subsidies.html">Dreamliner plant in South Carolina</a> and admitting it was due to workers in Washington state exercising their right to strike, a form of retaliation that was a prima facie violation of the Act.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Similarly, we have seen how companies have used the threat of relocation to extract subsidies from state and local governments. <a href="http://clawback.org/2012/01/05/sears-tax-breaks-and-job-loss-like-we-said/">Sears</a>, with its $275 million (nominal) retention package from Illinois, is just the most egregious in recent years. That package alone could support 550 state jobs at $50,000 a year for 10 years (assuming no raises, something pretty common for state workers lately though unlikely to last 10 years). And remember, Sears did this in 1989 as well, when it got $178 million not to move out of state.<br />    <br />More generally, who should win and who should lose from the growth of capital mobility? One possibility is that it would simply speed up the effects of trade. If Mexico had needed to wait for the growth of domestic entrepreneurs, it could not have expanded its exports to the U.S. nearly as rapidly as in the actual situation where U.S. companies could provide the money. In that case, we would simply expect the effect of heightened capital mobility to be the same as the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem.<br />    <br />But this would not explain why European labor appears as opposed to globalization as U.S. unions. Western Europe is labor abundant, so we would expect western European worker to benefit from the expansion of trade. Yet one does not have to look hard at all to see that European unions are not in love with globalization. The right answer now might be that those who are mobile win in the global economy, while those who are immobile lose. While capital is mobile geographically, governments are bound to their location. Workers, even where they have significant legal opportunities to move, as in the European Union, are still restricted in their mobility by their language abilities or lack thereof, and by the common desire to live near their families (another way in which corporations are not people, by the way). And it is not as if European capital can only be invested in the EU.<br />     <br />This is consistent with studies of the effect on home country labor of foreign investment (see <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Multinational-Enterprise-Economic-Cambridge-Literature/dp/0521478588">Richard Caves</a>&#8216; <i>Multinational Enterprise and Economic Analysis</i>): reduced employment because exports are replaced with foreign production, some possible increased employment due to supplying goods and services to foreign subsidiaries, but at best the result is a wash and more likely the net effect is negative.<br />    <br />If this is right, U.S. workers may have the worst of both worlds: they are harmed by expanding trade, and they are harmed by being less mobile than capital. While this does not explain the political changes that have happened in the U.S. since 1970 (though it is certainly relevant), it gives us a pretty good handle on the economic market pressures that the middle class needs to address politically. I will have more to say about these issues in future posts. </p>

<p>Is Globalization Good for America&#8217;s Middle Class? Part 1</p>
<p>In this blog, I have frequently documented economic trends that have been bad for the middle class: <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/03/basics-real-wages-remain-below-their.html">Declining real wages</a>, steadily <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/07/us-health-care-bang-for-buck-declining.html">falling bang for the healthcare buck</a>, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/04/america-shows-no-increase-in-college.html">stagnant educational attainment</a>, the gigantic <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/tax-havens-cost-middle-class-untold.html">cost of tax havens</a>, etc. With this post, I want to begin exploring one possible reason for the economic insecurity of the middle class, namely globalization. Today, we will look at who wins and who loses from international trade, one of the key elements of globalization.<br />    <br />In <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2010/04/29/everyone-prospers-with-free-tr">some circles</a>, one is likely to see a variant of the claim that &#8220;everybody&#8221; is better off because of freer trade. Even according to the most mainstream economic theory, this is simply false. The workhorse theory for determining the distributional effects of trade (i.e., who wins and who loses) is called the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem, first enunciated in an article by Wolfgang Stolper and Paul Samuelson in 1941.</p>
<p>To understand this theory, you need to know that economists think about national economies in terms of the amount of land, labor, and capital they have <u>compared to all other countries in the world</u>. These &#8220;factors of production&#8221; can be in relatively high supply compared to the rest of the world, in which case they are referred to as &#8220;abundant,&#8221; or in relatively low supply compared to the rest of the world, in which case we call them &#8220;scarce.&#8221;</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The theorem can be stated in quite simple terms, but its consequences are not at all simple: As trade expands, owners of abundant factors of production benefit, and owners of scarce factors of production are harmed. Here, &#8220;benefit&#8221; means their real income increases, while &#8220;harmed&#8221; means their real income decreases.</p>
<p>Remember, trade can expand for two main reasons. First technological innovations can reduce the cost of transportation, making it first possible, then cheaper, to send goods long distances. For example, political scientist <a href="http://press.princeton.edu/titles/4510.html">Ronald Rogowski</a>, in his great book <i>Commerce and Coalitions</i> shows how the introduction of the steamboat made it possible to export North American wheat to Western Europe, displacing wheat from Eastern Europe. Second, policy changes like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) or the trade agreements embodying the World Trade Organization (WTO) reduce or eliminate costly barriers to trade and lead to its expansion.<br />    <br />The grain example helps show why trade creates winners and losers. The Midwest U.S. and Canadian Prairie provinces are a gigantic breadbasket made possible by low population density, which implies abundant land and scarce labor. Expanding trade gave these farmers new markets and higher incomes. In much more densely populated Europe, the reverse is true: labor is abundant and land is scarce. As a result, expanding trade in grains meant more import competition and lower income for European farmers..    <br />Fast forward to today and we can ask what U.S. factor endowments are currently. As a rich country internationally, the United States is necessarily a capital abundant country. As a comparatively low population density country, it is land abundant but labor scarce. The answer is to our initial question is then quite clear: expanding trade is harmful to U.S. workers because imports of labor-intensive products and services from abroad create competition for American workers, reducing their real wages. As I have discussed before, U.S. real wages have remained below their peak for 39 straight years, just as the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem would predict.<br />     <br />What about <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/05/free-trade-benefits-everyone-canard.html">all the cheap goods we now buy at Wal-Mart</a>? It doesn&#8217;t change this story at all, because the lower price of imported goods is already reflected in the inflation rate we use to calculate real wages.    <br />Rogowski&#8217;s book also argues that we can expect certain pattens of political coalitions to form, with the winners from trade on one side and the losers on the other. NAFTA illustrated this well, with capital and agriculture generally in favor of the agreement (minus a few small specialty agricultural products like oranges), while labor was strongly opposed. And of course, this only helps us understand economic reasons for support or opposition to trade agreements; for non-economic reasons such as the environment, we have to look elsewhere. Although beyond the scope of this post, Rogowski&#8217;s analysis of the entire world through phases of rising and falling trade (i.e., the Great Depression) lends strong credence to his claims. You should definitely read his book sometime.<br />    <br />Economists are divided over how big this effect is. In the 1990s, when I first started teaching, the most common view of economists was that technological change was the driver increasing the premium for high skilled labor while reducing wages for low-skilled labor. Adrian Wood&#8217;s 1994 book, <i>North-South Trade, Employment, and Inequality</i>, argued that trade was in fact the main culprit, (a good, ungated analysis is Richard Freeman&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/scspi/_media/pdf/Classic_Media/Freeman_1995_Globalization.pdf">Are Your Wages Set in Beijing</a>?&#8221;). Although this met with a lot of resistance at the time, Wood&#8217;s view has gained a lot of traction among economists based on developments over the last 15 or so years. Paul Krugman, a particularly noteworthy example due to his Nobel prize, has gone from being <a href="http://web.mit.edu/krugman/www/ricardo.html">a fanatic adherent of free trade</a> to someone who sees trade as a big problem, though even today <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/protectionism-and-stimulus-wonkish/">he is not quite willing to pull the plug on free trade</a>.<br />    <br />One important point Rogowski makes (and Stolper and Samuelson did before him) is that the theory of comparative advantage tells us that the winners from trade gain more than the losers lose, which makes it possible in principle to compensate the losers and have everyone be better off. But he also argued that those who benefit economically from trade will see their political power increase, something that has certainly been borne out in the United States in the more than 20 years since his book was published. This makes it less likely that such compensation will occur, and we certainly haven&#8217;t seen any policy in the U.S. that comes close to making everyone better off as a result of trade.<br />    <br />One small bit of comfort comes from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Conscience-Liberal-Paul-Krugman/dp/0393060691">Paul Krugman&#8217;s book</a> <i>The Conscience of a Liberal</i> (pp. 262-3). He provides us some reason to think that the Stolper-Samuelson Theorem isn&#8217;t necessarily destiny, as he shows that the United State and Canada, two countries with the same factor endowments as each other, have distinctive differences in political outcomes, particularly with regard to unionization rates.    <br />Overall, unfortunately, it looks like the answer to today&#8217;s question is clear: freer trade has harmed, and is harming, the American middle class. But globalization is more than trade, and I will continue to analyze other elements of globalization in my next few posts. </p>
