<p>Tax cuts aren&#8217;t the only thing that work great in every situation.  Hoarding gold <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601072&#038;sid=a2sUvQ.vbcWY&#038;refer=energy">works too</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Gold is now regarded as a hedge against both inflation and deflation, says Alan Ruskin, the chief international strategist at Greenwich, Connecticut-based RBS Greenwich Capital Markets Inc. The first is reflected in the high dollar price of bullion, the second by the surge in goldâ€™s price in euros. </p></blockquote>
<p>Having been in the presence of gold at different times, I can attest that it also flies, improves mental health, and eliminates odors from cat poop boxes at twenty paces.   But seriously, what the heck does that second sentence even mean?  </p>
<p>FYI, the &#8220;RBS&#8221; in &#8220;RBS Greenwich Capital Markets Inc.&#8221; stands for Royal Bank of Scotland.  Yes, <a target="_blank" href="http://cbs4denver.com/businesswire/22.0.html?type=national&#038;serviceLevel=f&#038;category=f&#038;filename=EU--Britain-Earns-Roy.xml">that</a> Royal Bank of Scotland.  Now I didn&#8217;t know anything about Alan Ruskin, so I googled him.  It turns out he penned <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gata.org/node/5609">this piece</a> [link fixed- klh] on moral hazard in the Financial Times back in 2007.  </p>
<p>Anyway, there are a lot of places this post could go, and most of &#8217;em all but write themselves.   Have a go at it in comments.  <br />__________________________________<br />by cactus</p>
