<h4><a href="http://www.komonews.com/news/local/78088192.html">&#8216;Horror scene&#8217; as 4 Lakewood police officers shot, killed</a></h4>
<blockquote><p>LAKEWOOD, Wash. &#8211; Four uniformed police officers were shot and killed in a bloody Sunday morning attack at a Lakewood-area coffee shop, and investigators are seeking a person of interest in the killings, officials said.Pierce County Sheriff&#8217;s Office spokesman Ed Troyer said the person they are seeking is Maurice Clemmons, who is a fugitive from Arkansas with a lengthy criminal record.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not to be flip but is there a more hardened target in America than a fricking DONUT SHOP known as a pre-shift COP SHOP? Are we to imagine that everything would have been fine if four kindergarten and first grade teachers/armed monitors from the nearest elementary school had been having some pre-school coffee and going over their paperwork just as the cops were? Or maybe if the girl behind the counter had been packing?</p>
<p>And if we didn&#8217;t need more irony we have this:</p>
<h4><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/29/multiple-police-officers-_n_373119.html">Huckabee Granted Clemency To Maurice Clemmons, Person Of Interest, In Ambush That Killed 4 Cops</a></h4>
<blockquote><p>A man with an extensive criminal past &#8212; whose 95-year prison sentence was commuted in Arkansas nearly a decade ago by then-Gov. Mike Huckabee&#8211; was being sought Sunday as a &#8220;person of interest&#8221; in a deadly ambush on four police officers who were gunned down inside a coffee shop.</p></blockquote>
<p>Snip<br />
<blockquote>In 1989, Clemmons, then 17, was convicted in Little Rock for aggravated robbery. He was paroled in 2000 after then-Gov. Mike Huckabee commuted Clemmons&#8217; 95-year prison sentence. Huckabee, who was criticized during his run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 for the number of clemencies and commutations he granted, cited Clemmons&#8217; age at the time of the sentence.<br />After his release from prison, Clemmons violated his parole and was returned to prison in July 2001. He was released March 18, 2004, according to the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette newspaperÂ .</p></blockquote>
<p>But even without the sickening hypocrisy of Huckabee blaming the Sandy Hook shooting on the failure of first graders to engage in state sponsored prayer, we have a case of four trained, armed police officers just minutes from going on patrol being caught mostly unaware by a shooter determined to kill. In light of that the suggestion that all would have been well if only that principal had a M-4 locked in a cabinet in her office ring pretty hollow.</p>
