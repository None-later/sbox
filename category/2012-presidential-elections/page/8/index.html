<blockquote>&#8230;What if, rather than presenting a long and tedious speech that would constantly be interrupted by senators and congressmen mugging for the cameras, the President sat in the Oval Office, or anywhere, actually, and tapped out what he had to say in a hundred and forty characters?</p></blockquote>
<p> Obviously tongue in cheek because twitter doesn&#8217;t include pictures and facial expressions&#8230;like watching John Boehner&#8217;s face behind the President.</p>

<p>Obama&#8217;s State of the Union vs Romney&#8217;s Tax Returns</p>
<p>  Obama took the high ground in his state of the union address, where he pointedly noted the importance of applying fair tax rules to ensure that millionaires pay taxes at rates more similar to those paid by secretaries and firefighters. He wants a 30% rate on those with incomes of a million or more. <br />
<blockquote>We can either settle for a country where a shrinking number of people do really well, while a growing number of Americans barely get by,” Obama said in his address to a joint session of Congress. “Or we can restore an economy where everyone gets a fair shot, everyone does their fair share and everyone plays by the same set of rules.” STeven Sloan, Obama Says High-Earners Should Pay at least 30% of Income as Tax, Bloomberg.com, Jan 24, 2011.</p></blockquote>
<p>That would mean that Romney wouldn&#8217;t enjoy the exceptionally low rate of tax he had in 2010 after Congress enacted Obama&#8217;s suggested reforms. Romney released his tax returns on Tuesday. See this handy <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/01/24/us/politics/2011-romney-tax-returns.html">link on the New York Times</a> at which the 2010 and 2011 returns and accompanying documents are available, including links showing where Romney earned his $528,871 in speaking fees, etc.. Romney paid only 13.9% on $21.6 million of income, benefitting enormously from the low preferential capital gains rate of 15% that he paid on his returns from his investment of capital. Romney benefitted, too, from investments in the Cayman Islands, a well-known tax haven. And he is still earning &#8220;carried interest&#8221; from Bain Capital to the tune of multiple millions a year&#8211;that&#8217;s a share of the profits of a partnership he managed, treated as though it were a return on an investment of capital though it is paid for services. Romney is most definitely one of the 1%&#8211;actually in an even more rarefied class cluster of the top 0.006% of multimillionaires with lots of very low taxed income. See Kevin McCoy, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-01-24/mitt-romney-tax-return/52780230/1">Romney tax returns show he&#8217;s no average multipmillionaire</a>, USA Today (Jan. 24, 2011) (noting that only 8274 returns out of 140 million filed had income of $10 million or more in 2009); Lori Montgomery et al, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2012/01/23/gIQAj5bUMQ_story.html">Mitt Romney&#8217;s Tax Returns shed some light on his investment wealth</a>, Washington Post (Jan. 24, 2012); Nicholas Confessore, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/us/politics/romneys-tax-returns-show-21-6-million-income-in-10.html">Romney&#8217;s Tax Returns Show $21.6 Million Income in &#8217;10</a>, New York Times (Jan. 24, 2012).</p>
<p>As the Times story puts it:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>What Mr. Romney’s returns illustrated, instead, was the array of perfectly ordinary ways in which the United States tax code confers advantages on the rich, allowing Mr. Romney to amass wealth under rules very different from those faced by most Americans who take home a paycheck.</p></blockquote>
<p>Obama&#8217;s proposals sound reasonable. But I&#8217;d extend the basic concepts to the corporate tax. Every corporation that is making book profits of more than some amount ($5 million? $10 million) ought to be held to a similar minimum tax rate on those book profits. </p>
<p>Funny, that is what the original Alternative Minimum Tax (for individuals, and one for corporations) was supposed to achieve&#8211;to ensure that everybody paid at least a reasonable rate on their income, even if they could cumulate lots of preferences like mortgage interest deductions, state income taxes, property taxes, and similar deductions. Over time, the AMT has eroded&#8211;too many exceptions made, too many taxpayer friendly amendments, and then the Bush tax cut bills that lowered rates so that the AMT rates aren&#8217;t really working well as a &#8220;broader base but lower rate&#8221; tax that ensures that even high-flying income recipients pay a more reasonable tax rate on their income. <br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/01/obamas-state-of-the-union-vs-romneys-tax-returns.htm" title="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/01/obamas-state-of-the-union-vs-romneys-tax-returns.htm">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/01/obamas-state-of-the-union-vs-romneys-tax-returns.htm</a></p>

<p>In last Thursday&#8217;s debate, Newt Gingrich <a href="http://www.newt.org/news/speaker-newt-gingrich-and-mrs-gingrich-release-2010-income-tax-return-and-gingrich-foundation-t">released</a> his <a href="http://www.newt.org/sites/newt.org/files/2010FoundationReturn.pdf">2010 Gingrich Foundation tax return</a> and the <a href="http://www.newt.org/sites/newt.org/files/GingrichIncomeTaxReturn.pdf">Gingrich Joint Tax return</a>. See Kim Dixon &#038; Marcus Stern, <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/20/us-usa-taxes-gingrich-idUSTRE80J23W20120120">Gingrich tax return out, but much remains unseen</a>, Reuters (Jan. 20, 2012); Paul West, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/19/news/la-pn-gingrich-releases-tax-returns-20120119">Gingrich tax return details sources of income, alimony payment</a>, L.A. Times (Jan. 19, 2012); Jon Ward, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/19/newt-gingrich-releases-tax-returns_n_1217655.html">Newt Gingrich Releases His Tax Returns</a>, Huffington Post (Jan. 19, 2012; updated Jan. 20, 2012) (the Gingrich press release, with links to both returns, is also accessible from a link at bottom of this brief article).</p>
<p>The private foundation&#8217;s return lists Callista Gingrich (presumably in her role as President) as having custody of the books at the Foundation&#8217;s address in Washington. It lists Newt Gingrich as the only manager who contributed more than 2% of the contributions received during the year, and another form (Schedule B) lists Gingrich Holdings as the contributor of $152,609. Callista Gingrich is listed as the president (with zero compensation) and Newt Gingrich as a board member (with no compensation). A treasurer is listed with $1800 of compensation, a secretary with no compensation, and two other uncompensated board memberes.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br /> The Foundation supported the following organizations with a total of $120,000: Mount Vernon Association, Basilica of the National Shrine, Shiloh Point Elementary in Cumming GA, Amerivan Museum of Natural History in New York, The Washington Opera, The Atlanta Ballet, A Learning Foundation inAtlanta, the Arthritis Foundation, Mount Paran Christian School in Kennesaw GA, the Walker School in Marietta GA, Luther College in Decorah IA, Susan Chambers Dance in Sugar Hill GA, Breast Cancer Research in New York, and Alzheimer&#8217;s Association in Washington.<br />The joint tax return shows income in 2010 of more than $3 million, with about $450,000 in compensation income and about $2.5 million of Schedule E income through his S corporations Gingrich Holdings inc and Lubbers Agency Inc. and partnerships Draper Fisher Jurvetson Fund VIII and FLC XXXII Partnership LP. (He apparently restructured these businesses before entering into the Republican nomination contest, perhaps foreseeing better than Mitt Romney did that voters might react to the very idea of a giant holding company through which one receives one wealth.) The Salaries and Wages report shows that $450,000 in compensation income arising as follows: 252,500 in wages to Newt from Gingrich Holdings, Inc., and to Callista 5918 from National Shrine and 191,827 from Gingrich Productions, Inc. According to the Reuters story, Gingrich&#8217;s earlier disclosure said the Gingrich Holding income was mostly a distributive share (the tax term for a pass-through payment from an entity taxed as a partnership) from Gingrich Productions. His Schedule SE shows only 847 of self-employment taxes in connection with the various schedule C, K-1 etc. income, while Callista&#8217;s shows 268.</p>
<p>Also revealed on the tax return are the following: $41,625 in speaking and board of director fees (showed as business income on line 12), $6,853 in rental income, $26,655 in taxable interest, $11,892 in ordinary dividends (not eligible for the 15% net capital gain rate), $5,990 in qualified dividends (eligible for the 15% net capital gain rate), $4,184 in net short-term capital gains and $32,133 net long term capital losses and $33,124 of taxable refunds, credits or offsets for state and local income taxes The couple claimed a total itemized deduction of $215,095. They made $81,133 in contributions to various charities and paid $122,844 in state and local income taxes, $11,656 in real property taxes, and $2,422 in personal property taxes, as well as 8505 in tax preparation fees. They also enjoyed $10,754 of tax-exempt interest (not part of their taxable income). The Gingrich couple paid almost a million in taxes, giving them an effective tax rate on the 3.1 million of income of around 31%. 
<ul>
<li>Re those net short term capital gains: Gingrich bought and sold shares in Campbell Soup in 2010 (losing 74), bought shares in Celgene Corp in 2009 and sold them in 2010 (making 2591), sold in 2010 shares in American Funds Capital bought at various times, for a 346 gain, and similarly sold shares in Nuveen High Yield fo a 1225 gain. </li>
<li>Re those net long term capital losses: Gingrich sold shares bought at various times of Martek Bioscience, American Funds capital, Ishares Trust s&#038;P smallcap 600 and Ishares Trust Russell 1000 Value, which combined with the long-term totals from Schedule D-1 of 1.023 million (from sales of various funds and closing out of $600,000 worth of CDs) yielded an aggregate of 1.257 million with a claimed loss of $35,636. Using his capital gain distribution from Schedule D-1 of 1018, that left a net LTCL of 32,541.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are several things worth noting about Gingrich&#8217;s release of the couple&#8217;s tax information.<br />1) this is only a single year&#8217;s return&#8211;2010. George Romney, Mitt&#8217;s father, famously began the more transparent information sharing about presidential candidates by releasing 12 years&#8217; of his own tax returns. Gingrich should follow that example, even if Mitt isn&#8217;t sure he will. Multi-year returns are necessary for tax experts to even begin to pierce the veil of tax secrecy by seeing trends and patterns in types of income. One year of returns tells you very little. Gingrich should release returns back to his volatile period in Congress and his scuffle with the ethics inquiry, and should release returns relating to the period when he earned what he calls &#8220;consulting&#8221; fees based on his being a &#8220;historian&#8221; for Freddie Mac (see item 3). </p>
<p>2) we don&#8217;t have tax returns for Gingrich Holdings or Gingrich Productions, or even the informative financial statements that publicly traded companies are required to provide. Those privately held corporations are therefore able to function as &#8220;blockers&#8221; to maintain a good deal of secrecy about Gingrich&#8217;s own income even with the release of his return. <strong>Back before Nixon, corporate tax returns were public information and were not kept secret by the Service. We should go back to that,</strong> because corporations, whether publicly traded or held privately, are benefitting from the public trust and the state&#8217;s willingness to allow them to form. There seems to be little justification for maintaining any business entity returns as confidential documents, with some redaction allowed to maintain trade secrets. But until we do, we won&#8217;t know anything more than what Gingrich tells us (or reporters can get &#8220;deep throat&#8221; sources to divulge).</p>
<p>3) Gingrich&#8217;s return labels him a &#8220;consultant&#8221; but we know very little about his client list or his activities for his clients. We know he worked for Freddie Mac: he claims he wasn&#8217;t a lobbyist but that is a hard one to swallow whole. It is difficult to imagine Freddie Mac paying the consummate politician as though he were a mere historian doing historical research but it is very easy to imagine Freddie Mac paying a well-connected lobbyist, shoes that Gingrich&#8217;s role as House Speaker ensures that he would have fit into easily. We know that he worked as a &#8220;consultant&#8221; during the passage of the Medicare Part D prescription drug provision. Again, that sounds more like lobbying than &#8220;consulting&#8221;. The problem is that Washington has written weasel rules for lawmakers who &#8220;consult&#8221; so that they can claim they are not &#8220;technically&#8221; a lobbyist, as Gingrich is doing. But voters should want to see what kinds of reports he provided on the Medicare and Freddie Mac issues, as Romney is insisting. Otherwise, he is just hiding behind the very thin curtain of the fuzzy line between obvious lobbying and &#8220;not required to register-wink/wink lobbying&#8221;.</p>
<p>4) Congressmen pay themselves nice little pensions even while the GOP is making an ideology out of its desire to cut private pension benefits for unionized workers (in the name of &#8216;saving&#8217; business but really in the name of passing along even higher profits to managers and owners) and its intention of &#8220;reforming&#8221; Social Security (meaning leaving beneficiaries who depend on this system that they&#8217;ve paid into all their lives with less money than they should be able to have). Gingrich&#8217;s return reports more than $76,000 in 2010 from his Congressional pension.</p>

<p>Romney to release tax returns Tuesday (finally)</p>
<p>  Romney&#8217;s bitter loss to Newt Gingrich in the Republican primary in South Carolina demonstrated that playing the patrician elite above the fray has its limits as a campaign strategy. Romney&#8217;s strategists had apparently thought that they could get away with not releasing tax returns&#8211;at least not any except his 2011 ones (maybe) when filed&#8211;but they hadn&#8217;t counted on vicious attacks from the GOP right that questions his vulture capital millions and his top1% effective tax rate. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s what happens when there is a campaigner who thinks that earning $370,000 from speeches given to meaningless conventions of some trade or another is &#8220;just a little money&#8221;, while admitting that the money he still earns from the vulture fund where he oversaw takeovers of companies (and layoffs of employees and offshoring of work) manages to be taxed at a preferential rate of merely 15%.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />So after the loss to Gingrich (an odd man to try to claim a populist mantle when he had a $500,000 line of credit at Tiffany&#8217;s and disposes of old wives the way most people dispose of old socks), Romney has now announced that he will release returns plus an estimate of his 2011 taxes due. See Michael Shear, <a href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/romney-to-release-tax-returns-on-tuesday/">Romney to Release Tax Returns on Tuesday</a>, The Caucus, New York Times (Jan. 22, 2012).</p>
<p>One does wonder why it will be Tuesday when they are released. Why not today? or six months ago? Will they be redacted? Will the accompanying schedules that show his income coming through tax haven &#8220;companies&#8221; located in the law offices that house 18,000 others in the Caymans be there? Questions that we will have fun examining on Tuesday, anyway.</p>
<p>Oh, and Mitch Daniels, current governor of Indiana and Bush assistant who helped preside over the real growth of the federal deficit as Bush pushed through huge tax cuts while increasing federal spending (especially on preemptive wars), will give the GOP response to the State of the Union message. The Tea Party has picked Herman CAin&#8211;the author of the infamous 9-9-9 plan who wanted to shift the tax burden brutally onto the backs of the working poor. The GOP seems to have tax cuts for the rich accompanied by increasing burdens for the poor in its blood, doesn&#8217;t it<br />.<br /> originally published at <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/">ataxingmatter</a></p>

Here is her response, and in addition in a later e-mail Beverly makes this key point (intro amended for readability):   <br />
<blockquote>&#8230;that no constitutional amendment is necessary in order to nullify Citizens United, because Citizens United actually was decided on the basis of a purported issue of fact that was unsupported by any evidence and that can be refuted by actual clear evidence&#8211;and that that&#8217;s really the point that the Montana Supreme Court justices were making. </p></blockquote>
<p>and actually much more&#8230;.</p>
<p>by <strong>Beverly Mann</strong></p>
<p>The Beginning of the End of <i>Citizens United</i></p>
<p>The article makes the important point that <i>Citizens United</i> and <i>Bellotti</i>, the 1978 opinion that <i>Citizens United</i> uses as its justification, focus mainly on the listeners’ right to hear political speech rather than on the speaker’s right to speak, and so it is not corporate personhood but instead the money-is-speech Supreme Court tenet that is the operative precept in <i>Citizens United</i>. But then the authors claim that, because no listener was a plaintiff challenging the constitutionality of the statute, the Court had no authority to decide the issue on the basis of the supposed interests of listener members of the public. That’s ridiculous, and they themselves effectively refute it. They say:</p>
<blockquote><p>For their <a href="http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2727&#038;context=faculty_scholarship">traditional First Amendment balancing</a>, on one side of the scale, courts have categorized the speech as either a kind that communicates an idea, opinion, demand, information relevant to democratic debate, etcetera, or a kind that better fits the category of being merely an instrumentality of transactional conduct. (The speech can also fall in the middle between these two categories). The more communicative and the less transactional, the more weight the courts have recognized on this side of the scale. On the other side of the scale is weighed the amount of harm done by allowing the speech. Speech that merely facilitates the conduct of transactions, such as fraud, conspiracy, insider trading tips, pimping and so forth may properly be criminalized and regulated without much regard for the fact that the means for carrying out the transactions may be entirely speech. Money in politics falls within the category of transactional speech, and it also causes severe harm to the democratic form of government. It may, therefore, be regulated and criminalized.</p></blockquote>
<p>One reason why speech that communicates political argument, ideas, opinions, information relevant to democratic debate, is more protected under the First Amendment than commercial or transactional speech is that the public has a stronger interest in hearing, and therefore a stronger right to hear, political argument, ideas, information, etc., than it does transactional speech. A big part of the balancing in First Amendment speech cases concerns the interest of the listener.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Also, their statement that “[m]oney in politics falls within the category of transactional speech” is clearly wrong. It seems to me that money in politics isn’t speech at all. But it’s certainly not transactional speech. Transactional speech is the speech intended to induce the payment of money—speech intended to induce the purchase, or whatever. It’s not the payment of the money. </p>
<p>It’s also wrong to conclude that corporate personhood played no role at all in the outcome of <i>Citizens</i> <i>United</i>. The majority talked about the First Amendment right of corporations, unions, nonprofits, to have their message heard through mass media—and that therefore they themselves (the corporations, unions , nonprofits), like listeners of speech, have a First Amendment right to have their message heard only because they are deemed “persons.” The First Amendment gives rights only to persons or “persons”. So in this case, it was both the supposed rights of the human listeners and, separately, the supposed rights of the speaker “persons” that the Court found that the statute violated. But either one alone would have been enough, in the opinion of the Court’s bare majority, in this case.</p>
<p>Then there’s this paragraph, which makes no sense at all:</p>
<blockquote><p>First, the Roberts 5 stepped outside the court&#8217;s constitutional authority by taking up and deciding cases concerning election integrity. Maintaining the integrity of elections was a political question of such importance to the founding fathers who wrote the Constitution that in Article I, Sections 4 and 5, they specifically consigned to the elected Congress both regulation and judging of the manner of holding elections. The founders rightly understood that Congress would be far more subject to popular pressure to maintain election integrity than would the appointed-for-life members of the court. Taking up a case and overturning a law that provides for election integrity infringes a power specifically assigned to Congress, thereby undermining the separation of powers. This also violates the court&#8217;s own well-established precedent of refusing jurisdiction concerning political questions. The court followed this traditional rule defining the boundary between judicial and legislative issues from the 1803 decision in <em>Marbury v. Madison</em> until the <em>Buckley</em> decision in 1976.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huh? <i>Of course</i> the Court has the constitutional authority to take up and decide cases concerning election integrity. Yes, Article I, Sections 4 and 5, specifically consign to the elected Congress both regulation and judging of the manner of holding elections. Other sections of Article I, and other parts of the Constitution, consign to Congress the writing of other types of statutes. And under <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>, the Court has the authority to decide the constitutionality of those statutes.<br />They are right that the court improperly “overruled a fully supported legislative finding that private money in elections causes sufficient harm to justify its regulation.” In the Montana case discussed in the article, in which the Montana Supreme Court on Dec. 31 issued an opinion upholding the constitutionality of a longtime Montana statute limiting campaign contributions and (I believe) campaign expenditures supposedly independent of specific candidates’ campaigns, despite Citizens United, there was specific, strong evidence both of actual corruption before the enactment of the legislation, and of a strong public belief that unlimited contributions and independent expenditures by corporate interests (or by very wealthy individuals) undermines the integrity of the legislative process. </p>
<p>The Montana Supreme Court opinion details this. In <i>Citizens</i> <i>United</i>, the majority said they concluded that neither of these existed. But in light of the detailed examples of that type of corruption, and the statement of six of the seven Montana Supreme Court justices that they themselves believe that unlimited contributions and independent expenditures directly corrupts the legislative process, it will be a lot of fun to watch the Supreme Court majority reiterate that they “find” that there is no such corruption and no public perception that that kind of money undermines the integrity of the legislative process.</p>
<p>The <i>Citizens United</i> majority’s purported finding was intended as a finding of fact, not a statement of law—a very big difference, and the reason that, as you know, Dan, I disagree with the legal pundits who have said they expect that the Supreme Court will overrule the Montana Supreme Court. <br />In <i>Citizens United</i>, the Supreme Court simply decided on its own to address this issue and the constitutionality of the part of the McCain-Feingold law that this supposed finding of fact concerned. There was no evidentiary hearing in the trial court concerning either actual corruption or the public perception of it, related to unlimited campaign contributions and unlimited independent campaign expenditures by corporations. The Court’s majority simply pronounced their finding of fact based upon nothing more than their personal views, their own ideology, as if ideology and the personal opinions of five justices is evidence.</p>
<p>In my opinion, under the ruling in <i>Citizens United</i>, which actually is a fact-based ruling rather than a categorical statement of constitutional law, Congress could re-enact a statute similar to that part of McCain-Feingold, and as the law stands now, under Citizens United, defend its constitutionality in court. When the statute’s constitutionality is challenged, the government, in defending in the lawsuit, could parade huge numbers of people—some of them very high-profile. NY Times columnist, Thomas Friedman, for example, has called the system of campaign contributions legalized bribery authorized by the Supreme Court), some of them just ordinary folks from, say, Montana—to refute the unsupported , out-of-the-blue, findings of fact in <i>Citizens United</i>.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, the Supreme Court, in, say, the Montana case suddenly changes the stated justification for its Citizens United ruling, from a supposedly fact-based one to a categorical ruling of law that the First Amendment bars any such statutory restrictions irrespective of facts, and therefore overtly removes this area of First Amendment law from the usual balancing-of-interests analysis. Most people think that’s what they did in <i>Citizens United</i>. But it’s not. The Montana Supreme Court justices recognized this, and it was the basis for their ruling.</p>
<p>And once the Montana case gets to the Supreme Court, and gets the national publicity it will get if (almost certainly, when) the Supreme Court agrees to hear it, the public will learn this. I think the Court will be treading quite close to losing the confidence of a vast majority of the public if it reiterates its own claimed finding of fact from <i>Citizens United</i>, in the face of the extensive evidence in that case (again, including the view of six of the seven Montana Supreme Court justices) that vast majorities of the public do, as a matter of fact, perceive that unlimited campaign contributions and veneer-thinly-independent electioneering expenditures compromise the integrity of the legislative system. And I think the justices will recognize that.</p>
<p>Which will leave them with the choice between categorically rewriting a significant part of First Amendment law, which they superficially nodded to in <i>Citizens United</i> and circumvented there via their spontaneous finding of fact, or instead once again overtly supersede clear fact with their own Mad Hatter view of it. Sit tight.</p>

<div>Political Opportunity (Not)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The link at the end of Steve Roth’s post yesterday, “<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/american-exceptionalism-238-opportunity.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">American Exceptionalism #238: Opportunity (Not)</a>,” is to a post on Sunday by Paul Krugman on his NYT blog, in which he discusses Alan Krueger’s speech last week.  Krugman’s blog entry says:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Alan Krueger, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers … gave a <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/events/2012/01/krueger.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">very informative speech</a> on inequality last week that should have received more press than it did. Much of it was stuff that inequality mavens already know, but he had one striking result that was what I suspected but hadn’t seen demonstrated: a clear negative relationship between inequality at a point in time and intergenerational social mobility.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Below is what he dubs the Great Gatsby Curve…. As he shows [using graphs], America is both especially unequal and has especially low mobility. But he also argues that because we are even more unequal now than we were a generation ago, we should expect even less social mobility going forward.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As everyone who discusses politics with me knows,  huge pet peeves of mine are Obama’s refusal to discuss specific facts, including statistics, in speeches to the public—and his failure even to speak to the public at all on substantive issues.  Exceptions are ridiculously rare.  But the campaign is about to start, and—who knows?—he might actually deign to occasionally speak in specifics and cite facts (including statistics) in order to refute the Republican mantras of anti-Keynesianism and anti-progressive tax codes.  Assuming, of course, that he agrees with his own Council of Economic Advisers chairman about the importance of the statistics, and recognizes the salience of those statistics with the public.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another pet peeve of mine is the silly meme of political pundits, such as Maureen Dowd, in which they repeatedly describe Obama as professorial—as if professors teach their classes by speaking in clichés and generics.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But even if Obama continues his personal policy of refusing to argue Democratic economics and tax policy and to use statistics to support the arguments, Democratic congressional candidates hopefully will be smart enough to mention the important statistics and discuss them.  I expect that Elizabeth Warren will be a model for them in this.  Hopefully they’ll take note and follow her lead.</div>
<div> </div>

<p>Romney Reveals His Tax Rate Is &#8216;Probably Closer to 15 Percent</p>
<p>Source for this article:  Emily Friedman, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/01/romney-reveals-his-tax-rate-is-probably-closer-to-15-percent/" target="_blank">Romney Reveals His Tax Rate Is &#8216;Probably Closer to 15 Percent'&#8221;</a>, ABC News, Jan. 17, 2012. 
<div>At a press conference following the GOP debate last night, GOP presumed favored candidate Mitt Romney acknowledged for the first time that his effective tax rate is around 15%.  That&#8217;s a lot lower rate than middle class taxpayers typically pay. </div>
<div>Romney isn&#8217;t releasing his full return&#8211;at least not yet.  He says maybe he&#8217;ll release just the 2011 return in April.  But not any back returns. (That&#8217;d tell us more about his gains at Bain Capital than he probably wants us to know.)</div>
<div>What are his sources of income?  Romney acknowledges that during the last 10 years, his income comes &#8220;overwhelmingly&#8221; from some investments made in the past.  Other sources include a &#8220;little bit&#8221; from his book and &#8220;not very much&#8221; from speaker fees.  (&#8220;Not very much&#8221; is obviously a relative term.  Romney&#8217;s financial disclosure report released in August indicated that he was paid more than $370,000 in speaker fees for that filing period.  That&#8217;s considerably more than any middle class taxpayer makes&#8212;but doesn&#8217;t amount to &#8220;very much&#8221; for Romney, who is worth somewhere around $250 million or so.)</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>So for 10 years, Romney admits, he hasn&#8217;t labored much, but has nonetheless made considerable investment income that gets preferentially taxed.  That of course is a core problem with the preferential rate for capital income&#8211;it merely makes the festering wound of hugely unequal distribution of income (and wealth) worse.  The preferential rate is, essentially, a tax policy favoring redistribution upwards.  The rich get to pay a lower tax rate on their income than their secretaries, and their income is especially protected by other policies as well (like the weakening of unions from Reagan on, privatization of public activities from Reagan on, lax enforcement of anti-trust rules, lax enforcement of banking regulations, etc.).</div>
<div>At least Romney recognizes that the rich don&#8217;t need (and the economy wouldn&#8217;t benefit from) even more favorable tax breaks for rich people&#8217;s favored kind of income.  He noted that &#8220;the speaker&#8217;s plan to eliminate the capital gains tax for high income individuals&#8211;capital gains, interest and dividdnds&#8211;would not only be a very expensive provision in terms of having to fill an even larger budget hold but that would provide for people of very high income a possibility of no tax at all. &#8230; I just don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the right course.&#8221;  (But he does want to lower corporate tax rates, which&#8211;under the theory that corporate taxes are borne by corporate owners&#8211;would be just another form of preferential taxation for rich people who own most of the corporate stock.)</div>
<div></div>

<p>Romney&#8217;s Tax Plan Helps the 1%, Hurts the Bottom 40%</p>
<p>In spite of having to suffer some closer view of his Bain Capital time&#8211;during which the self-proclaimed &#8220;job creator&#8221; businessman did a lot of job cutting and destruction of going concerns so that his investors could make more money, Romney continues on his well-financed cruise to the GOP nomination.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s perhaps an appropriate time to bring out the Urban Institute/Tax Policy Center&#8217;s analysis of the Romney 59-point tax plan.  They have produced a <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3257" target="_blank">table</a> (T12-0004) showing &#8220;Mitt Romney&#8217;s Tax Plan Baseline: Current Policy Distribution of Federal Tax Change by Cash Income Percentile, 2015.&#8221;  The table looks at individual and corporate income, payroll (Medicare and Social Security) and estate taxes to determine the change in the total federal taxes for the various quintiles under Romney.</p>
<p>Who would have federal tax increases under Romney? Not the rich who have captured more and more of the income over the last decades.  Treating corporate shareholders as the payers of the corporate income tax, the table shows that the top one percent would get an average federal tax cut of $86,535 under Romney&#8217;s plan, while the top one-tenth of one percent would get an average tax cut of $432,940.   </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>But guess what, the bottom two quintiles&#8211;made up of the poorest Americans who are struggling to make ends meet and who can be pushed off kilter by a single illness or other unexpected expenditure&#8211;will be the ONLY ones in the distribution who will pay more federal taxes under Romney&#8217;s plan than under the current policy baseline.  About 18% in that lowest quintile will pay almost a thousand more in taxes.  About 13% in the lowest quintile will pay about $125 less in taxes.  Similarly, in the second lowest quintile, about 18% will pay almost a thousand more; however, at least for this quintile about a third will pay almost $500 less, so that the overall increase averaged across these groups is less.</p>
<p>This is an unacceptable result.  The New York Times recently reported on various studies on inequality and a survey that shows that more and more people, across the spectrum of ideologies, ages, gender and other lines, now consider the conflict between rich and non-rich as important.  Survey Finds Rising Perception of Class Tension, New York Times, Jan. 11, 2012. </p>
<p>The demographics were surprising, experts said. While blacks were still more likely than whites to see serious conflicts between rich and poor, the share of whites who held that view increased by 22 percentage points, more than triple the increase among blacks. The share of blacks and Hispanics who held the view grew by single digits.</p>
<p>What is more, people at the upper middle of the income ladder were most likely to see conflict. Seventy-one percent of those who earned from $40,000 to $75,000 said there were strong conflicts between rich and poor, up from 47 percent in 2009. The lowest income bracket, less than $20,000, changed the least.</p>
<p>The reason the rich are getting richer is because the country has followed policies, essentially since Reagan, that favor the rich&#8211;from deregulation to relaxation of anti-trust to reduction in tax burdens to privatization to deunionization.  To add further rich-friendly policies to our tax code at this point should not be countenanced.</p>

                                <p>Romney’s Tax Proposal
<p>The <a href="http://taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/romney-plan.cfm">Tax Policy Center</a> provides its review of which taxpayers will pay more and which ones will pay less under the tax proposal introduced by Mitt Romney. A really short summary goes as follows:</p>
<p>(a) The well to do will pay less in taxes;   <br />(b) The working poor will pay more in taxes; and   <br />(c) Overall tax revenue will be significantly reduced. </p>
<p>But wasn’t that also the case for the Herman Cain tax proposal as well as any other tax proposal from the Republican candidates for President? And the Republicans claim they are for fiscal responsibility! </p>

                                <p>Sort of lifted from Robert&#8217;s Stochastic Thoughts:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rick Santorum has no use for the Ivy League, or the economists produced therein. (He also expressed doubts about the Republican reliance on economists from the &#8220;Australian school.&#8221;(Johannas von Quiggin take note) Likely he meant the &#8220;Austrian school&#8221;.</p></blockquote>

<p>Uh.</p>
<p>&#8230; this isn&#8217;t one of the three Republican hopefuls who are notoriously ignorant and gaffe prone.   <br />I don&#8217;t want to hear any whining about Howard or gloating over &#8220;Howard&#8217;s End.&#8221; He would look like a love child of Albert Einstein and Rosa Luxemburg in this crowd.</p>
