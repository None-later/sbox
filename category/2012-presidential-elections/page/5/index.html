<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/romney-is-still-hiding.html">Romney is still hiding his tax history (Part IV)</a></p>
<p>As I noted in several prior posts about the reasons that multiple years of the Romneys&#8217; tax returns are essential to evaluating <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-ii.html">Romney</a> as a presidential candidate, the fact that Romney has adamantly refused to release returns other than the 2010 actual return (and the 2011 estimated return) is a cause for concern.  Since the established norm is that presidential candidates release 8-12 years of returns, Romney&#8217;s insistence on not disclosing other returns appears arrogant and disrespectful of voters and suggests that there may be one or more items in those returns that he doesn&#8217;t want voters to know about.  The prior posts included some information about items that could be better assessed with more returns and related information to review, including among others: passive activity losses, questions of whether certain items are hobbies or can legitimately be classed as business expenses, foreign bank accounts, tax shelters, offshore companies, income from <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-iii.html">Bain Capital</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rate">effective tax rate</a>.  Much speculation has centered on the fact that Romney has accounts in various tax haven jurisdictions (Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Singapore) as well as bank accounts in jurisdictions that have been noted for banking secrecy and the accompanying tax evasion possibilities. </p>
<p>Since the US began cracking down on <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-ii.html">Swiss bank account</a> holders who had avoided their reporting responsibilities, this latter issue has gained considerable visibility.  It turns out that many Americans had multi-million dollar accounts abroad that weren&#8217;t reported and on which they weren&#8217;t paying taxes.  With the breakthroughs facilitated by whistleblowers that threatened an avalanche of information about other bankers, other accounts and other accountholders, many of those lawbreakers came forward to participate in voluntary disclosure programs through which most could pay a penalty and a settled amount for taxes and avoid criminal prosecution.  So US taxpayers (and voters) want to know&#8211;did the Romneys participate in that disclosure program.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Ed Kleinbard (former chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation and currently at University of Southern California) and Peter Canellos (former chair of the New York State Bar Association Tax Section and current private practitioner) have raised another important issue that would be revealed more clearly with additional tax returns&#8211;Romney&#8217;s participation in abusive tax shelter activity.  See Kleinbard &#038; Canellos, <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/08/opinion/canellos-kleinbard-romney-taxes">Romney&#8217;s Role in Tax Shelter Raises Questions</a>, CNN op-ed (Aug. 8, 2012).   The authors note that Romney&#8217;s limited release of tax returns doesn&#8217;t &#8220;dispel the legitimate concerns that arises from hints buried in his scant disclosure to wealth.&#8221;  But they note that a &#8220;relevant line of inquiry&#8221; is &#8220;what exists in the public record regarding his attitude toward tax compliance and tax avoidance.&#8221;  So they decide to see what that might be.</p>
<p>They find something troubling&#8211;his acceptance of abusive tax shelter activity by large multinational corporations when he headed Marriott International&#8217;s audit committee and approved the company&#8217;s involvement in a Son of Boss deal, a transaction undertaken purely for tax purposes to create artificial losses that would then be used to offset real gains from business activities and thereby substantially reduce the company&#8217;s tax bills.<br />
<blockquote>A key troubling public manifestation of Romney&#8217;s apparent insensitivity to tax obligations is his <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-22/romney-as-auditing-chairman-saw-marriott-son-of-boss-tax-shelter-defy-irs.html">role in Marriott International&#8217;s abusive tax shelter activity</a>.<br />*** From 1993 to 1998, Romney was the head of the audit committee of the Marriott board.<br />During that period, Marriott engaged in a series of complex and high-profile maneuvers, including &#8220;Son of Boss,&#8221; a notoriously abusive prepackaged tax shelter that investment banks and accounting firms marketed to corporations such as Marriott. In this respect, Marriott was in the vanguard of a then-emerging corporate tax shelter bubble that substantially undermined the entire corporate tax system.<br />*** [T]he government initiated legal challenges that resulted in complete disallowance of the losses claimed by Marriott and other corporations. *** [T]he government brought successful criminal prosecutions against a number of individuals involved in Son of Boss. ***<br /><strong>In his key role as chairman of the Marriott board&#8217;s audit committee, Romney approved the firm&#8217;s reporting of fictional tax losses exceeding $70 million generated by its Son of Boss transaction. His endorsement of this stratagem provides insight into Romney&#8217;s professional ethics and attitude toward tax compliance obligations</strong>. (emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p>So Romney as &#8220;businessman&#8221; (his claimed primary qualification for serving as President) was happy to sign off on tax scam transactions intended to benefit his corporation at the cost of ordinary taxpayers who are called upon to make up the difference in higher rates of borrowing by the federal government or higher taxes.  Can Romney hide behind the excuse of&#8211;Oops, I was just an unsophisticated board member who relied on tax advisers and couldn&#8217;t be expected to understand such complex transactions and tax issues?  No way.  As Kleinbard and Canellos note in their op-ed:<br />
<blockquote>In his key position as head of the board&#8217;s audit committee, Romney was required under the securities laws and his fiduciary duties to review the transaction. In fact, it has been publicly reported that<strong>Romney was the Marriott Board member most acquainted with the transaction and to whom the other board members turned for advice.</strong> This makes sense because <strong>aggressive tax-driven financial engineering was a large part of what Romney (and Bain) did for a living</strong>. For these reasons, it is fair to hold him accountable for Marriott&#8217;s spurious tax reporting. <br />*** [Romney] had an insider&#8217;s perspective on the motivation and lack of substance in the transaction, as well as the financial sophistication to understand the tax avoidance involved. <strong>Romney failed in his duties to Marriott and its shareholders and acted to undermine the fairness of the tax system</strong>. (emphasis added).</p></blockquote>
<p>These issues are critically important to Romney&#8217;s purported qualifications to serve as president.  A man who is willing to bend/break the rules in order to make more money for himself and his elite buddies doesn&#8217;t belong in the White House.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/08/its-time-stop-celebrating-harry-reid#disqus_thread">Kevin Drum</a> has an opinion on election tactics:</p>
<blockquote><p>Come on, folks. Reid didn&#8217;t say <em>I&#8217;ll bet Romney didn&#8217;t pay any taxes</em>. He didn&#8217;t say he talked to someone familiar with high earners who told him <em>Maybe Romney won&#8217;t release his returns because he didn&#8217;t pay any taxes</em>. He made a flat statement of fact. He said he has an &#8220;extremely credible source,&#8221; which in this context means someone with direct knowledge of Romney&#8217;s taxes who decided to pick up the phone and dish about it to Harry Reid. Does anyone really believe this? Really? Then, as if that weren&#8217;t enough, Reid made his little bluff even less plausible by deciding that Romney didn&#8217;t just avoid all taxes for one year, he avoided them for <em>ten years</em>. Yeah, baby, that&#8217;s the ticket! Put these two things together with the fact that Reid hasn&#8217;t even tried to make his fairy tale sound believable (it&#8217;s just some guy he talked to) and this is not a story that a five-year-old would credit. It&#8217;s just Reid making stuff up in order to put pressure on Romney, and I think we all know it.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Can I prove this? Of course not. Given the epistemological limits of proof, I can&#8217;t prove Barack Obama was born in the United States either. Nevertheless, I feel safe saying that anyone who claims to have an &#8220;extremely credible source&#8221; that Obama was born elsewhere is either crazy or lying. The same is true for Reid, and Reid isn&#8217;t crazy. It&#8217;s simply vanishingly unlikely that he&#8217;s telling the truth, and no one — not liberal or conservative — would spend even ten seconds on a story so patently far-fetched if it were anybody but Reid and the background were anything but the frenzy of a presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Politically, of course, Reid&#8217;s ploy has worked like a charm. Romney&#8217;s taxes are back in the news and Romney&#8217;s ham-handed handling of the whole affair has kept it there. And that gives everyone a fifth reason to cheer on Reid: the end justifies the means.</p>
<p>Take a deep breath, folks. This is contemptible stuff and it&#8217;s not just business as usual. We&#8217;ve spent too many years berating the tea partiers for getting on bandwagons like this to get sucked into it ourselves the first time it&#8217;s convenient. It&#8217;s time to quit cheering on Reid and get off this particular bus.</p></blockquote>

<p>What&#8217;s Romney Got to Hide? (Part III)</p>
<p>In the last two posts, I explored a number of fairly simple questions that might be raised about Romney&#8217;s activities that would be clarified by seeing multiple returns (hobby versus investment/business losses; business versus passive activity losses; amounts of preferentially taxed income; income reported from Bain Capital and/or from foreign accounts) and some of the &#8220;squirrelier&#8221; possibilities that tax experts have raised (potential that Romney participated in the IRS voluntary disclosure &#8220;amnesty&#8221; program for reports on offshore accounts after the initiation of unraveling of Swiss banking secrecy as a result of the UBS scandal, in order to avoid weightier penalties, including potential criminal charges; contributions to IRAs that were undervalued, possibly by claiming zero value for partnership interests; use of aggressive tax sheltering transactions to &#8216;create&#8217; capital losses to offset substantial capital gains, resulting in the net capital loss carryforward on the 2010 tax return).</p>
<p>Ed Kleinbard, a former partner at Cleary Gottlieb who served as chief of staff for the JCT and is now a law professor at Southern California, has joined with Peter Canellos, a prominent tax practitioner and former chair of the prestigious New York State Bar Association Tax Section, to address these issues regarding the importance of seeing multiple past years of Romney&#8217;s tax returns.  See Kleinbard &#038; Canellos,<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/07/18/opinion/kleinbard-canellos-romney-tax/index.html?hpt=hp_c1">Why won&#8217;t Romney release more tax returns?, </a>CNN (July 18, 2012).  Hat tip Calvin Johnson.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So what do Kleinbard and Canellos add to this debate?  Perhaps most importantly, they note the importance of transparency in the vetting of presidential candidates :  as they say, &#8220;[t]he U.S. presidency is a position of immense magnitude and requires a thorough vetting.&#8221; (emphasis added)  Accordingly, they point out the advantage to the American public of the disclosure practice initiated by Romney&#8217;s father George Romney four decades ago and .<br />
<blockquote>Since George Romney inaugurated the practice more than 40 years ago by releasing 12 years of tax returns in his bid for the Republican Party nomination, presidential nominees have been transparent with voters about their personal finances. For this reason, we have not suffered a significant tax scandal involving a nominee or sitting president since President Richard Nixon&#8217;s abuse of the tax code.<br />***<br />Disclosure goes to the heart of the truthfulness with which a nominee engages the American people, and it assures us that he in fact has comported himself before the election with the high moral character we associate with a future president.<br />***<br />What the American people deserve is a complete and honest presentation by Romney of how his wealth was accumulated, where it is now invested, what purpose is served by all the various offshore vehicles in which he has an interest and what his financial relationship with Bain Capital has been since his retirement from the company. These are all factors that go to the heart of his character and values.</p></blockquote>
<p>Like the rest of us who have discussed this issue, Kleinbard and Canellos note that it is Romney&#8217;s abject refusal to follow his father&#8217;s example and disclose a decade&#8217;s worth of returns that &#8220;undermines the assumption&#8221; that would otherwise apply &#8220;that there cannot be any tax skeletons in his closet.&#8221;  Our only tool is to &#8220;reconstruct his financial record&#8221; from what he has released.  And that leads us to &#8220;red flags that raise serious tax compliance questions with respect to his possible tax minimization strategies in earlier years.&#8221;  Disclosure, they note, could &#8220;replace speculation with truth-telling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kleinbard and Canellos go on to discuss some key issues (some already addressed in prior posts)
<ul>
<li><strong>the Swiss bank account:</strong> Why would a presidential nominee be betting against the US dollar by speculating in Swiss Francs?  The account was closed in 2010, but was its income reported on earlier returns and were the FBAR reports timely filed as required? Did the Romneys participate in the 2009 partial tax amnesty for unreported offshore accounts? </li>
<li><strong>the $100 million IRA</strong>: How could an account restricted to annual contributions of $30,000 grow to $100 million? Does it represent &#8220;unprecedented prescience in &#8230; Romney&#8217;s investment choices&#8221; or does it mean that &#8220;Romney stuffed far more into his retirement plans each year than the maximum allowed by law by claiming that the stock of the Bain company deals that the reitrement plan acquired had only a nominal value&#8221; (relying on a safe harbor rule about taxation of service partner&#8217;s receipt of such interests that is, however, inapplicable to contributions of those interests to a retirement plan)? </li>
<li><strong>the Romney family trusts</strong>:  &#8220;Did Romney report and pay gift tax &#8230; or did he claim similarly unreasonable valuations, which likewise would have exposed him to serious penalties if all the facts were known? </li>
<li><strong>the complexity of Romney&#8217;s assets</strong>:  even multiple years of returns won&#8217;t answer all these questions given the &#8220;complexity&#8221; and &#8220;arcane&#8221; and &#8220;opaque&#8221; nature of Romney&#8217;s financial affairs, so disclosure about specific issues, such as the $100 million IRA, will be needed </li>
<li><strong>the low Romney tax rate</strong>:  a tax rate of 13.9% on $22 million is exceedingly low&#8211;lower than the rate paid by ordinary American wage-earners making 40-50 thousand a year.  How can we trust Romney to enact wise policy&#8211;which the vast majority of tax experts concur is to remove the super-preferential rate on the compensation income of private equity fund managers?  &#8220;Romney has not explained how, as president, he can bring objectivity to bear on this tax loophole that is estimated as costing all of us billions of dollars every year.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Will Romney respond to these continuing calls for full disclosure about how his wealth has been built, where it is invested, and just what purpose the various offshore entities serve?  If he does not, we can only think the worst. <br />crossposted with <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-iii.html">ataxingmatter</a></p>

<p>What&#8217;s Romney Got to Hide? It&#8217;s past time for financial and tax transparency</p>
<p>As everybody who has followed anything about this election cycle knows, Mitt Romney&#8211;likely the wealthiest man to run for president, the only bankster/private equity fund founder (sole shareholder, CEO and manager) to run for president, and probably the only person with multiple multi-million dollar accounts stashed away in tax havens like Bermuda, Cayman Islands and Swiss banks to run for president&#8211;still thinks the kinds of information that one can glean from full disclosure of tax returns isn&#8217;t relevant to his attempt to gain the presidency.  He has reiterated his refusal to release more than the 2010 and (estimated, at this point) 2011 returns.</p>
<p>Yet there are many questions voters can legitimately ask about Romney&#8217;s finances and tax returns, questions that cannot be answered with certainty without seeing multiple years of returns.  Let&#8217;s consider the most obvious ones.</p>
<p>1. Offshoring of assets:   It is clear from the paucity of return information we do have that the Romneys hold a considerable portion of their assets offshore.  It is not unreasonable to wonder why someone who desires to be President of the US would find it necessary or even reasonable to put so much of his (or their) assets offshore, taking them out of the US.  Clearly, offshore assets are harder to trace, harder to account for, and possibly easier to hide from tax administrators but one would certainly hope that wouldn&#8217;t be the reason behind a very wealthy candidate&#8217;s use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offshore_bank">offshore accounts</a>.  Just as clearly, the fact of offshore multimillion dollar accounts does not establish tax avoidance, since Romney could be appropriately reporting and paying taxes on all of his foreign holdings.  Yet the fact that it is not illegal per se to hold assets offshore begs the question that does count&#8211; why is he holding so much in offshore accounts?  What&#8217;s the benefit to him?  If he is as patriotic as he claims, why doesn&#8217;t he show that by putting his assets in the US, in essence &#8220;putting his money where his mouth is&#8221;?  If he can&#8217;t clearly explain to voters what the reasonable benefit to him is of having assets stashed offshore, then voters may draw the conclusion that he has something to hide.</p>
<p>2. Hobby horses?:  Like many of the ultra wealthy, the Romneys have enough money to engage in whatever pastimes and pleasures they like&#8211;they can own an expensive horse, arrange for it to be pastured and cared for near one of their many multimillion-dollar residences, and even ship it overseas (costing tens of thousands of dollars) for participation in sporting events.  The question this raises for ordinary Americans is how do the Romneys treat this activity on their tax returns, and is that treatment justifiable under the rules? </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>There are rules for activities that are &#8220;not engaged in for profit&#8221; under section 183 (generally called the hobby loss provision), that allow participants to deduct hobby expenses only to the extent of income from the hobby activity.  Activities engaged in for profit include active conduct of businesses and investment activities.  Everything else falls under this hobby provision, which amounts to a truly generous provision for mostly wealthy households who can afford to buy expensive toys that allow them to sometimes earn related income&#8211;Ie, this provision covers consumption that one engages in for personal enjoyment rather than for the potential profits.  There is a test requiring profits in 3 out of 5 years  (4 out of 7 for activities involving horses) to escape the hobby provision.  So voters can rightly wonder whether the Romney&#8217;s treat their costs for their horseshow competitions as a business.  (This is the same question tax experts had about <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/05/hobby-losses-section-183-benefits-the-wealthy.html">Todd Palin</a>&#8216;s claim that his snowmobile racing was a business even though there appeared to be a good deal of circumstancial evidence that it was instead merely a pleasurable sports activity/hobby.)   To know whether not treating such activities as hobbies under section 183 is correct, one needs to see at least 5 consecutive years of tax returns:  there simply is insufficient information without that. </p>
<p>3.  Passive activities?  The same type of activities that raise questions about the categorization as hobby or business/investment also potentially raise questions about the passive activity rules. Section 469 limits the ability of taxpayers to use &#8220;passive activity losses&#8221; against other income, such as that from businesses actively conducted by the taxpayer (including salaries from the business of being an employee).  Generally, losses from passive investments are &#8220;schedularized&#8221;, meaning that they are generally allowed only against passive income (there are exceptions).  It would be useful, again, to see multiple years of returns in order to reach a comfortable conclusion about the way the Romneys&#8217; various activities fall within these rules (or not).  </p>
<p>4. Retirement accounts?  One question making waves is how a retirement account for which strict contribution limitations apply could possibly have a value of more than $100 million today if only about $30,000 of assets was put in just a decade ago.  See, e.g., Felix Salmon, Opinion: Did Romney put Bain Capital shares in his IRA? Reuters, July 16, 2012 (noting comments by Bill Cohan, Nicholas Shaxson).  We all know that our retirement accounts (generally created with cash contributions from our salaries) have tended to lose money, not gain&#8211;and certainly most Americans&#8217; retirement accounts haven&#8217;t gained at those astronomical levels.  So voters could reasonably ask what assets were added to that account that could have increased in worth so significantly in such a short period of time.  Without the release and more disclosure of such information, voters might reasonably be suspicious that assets were knowingly undervalued upon being added, with the knowledge that their actual fair market value would show significant amounts attributable to earnings within the account. </p>
<p>The Salmon article cited above mentions a theory that the retirement accounts were &#8220;pumped with risky A shares in Bain, that &#8220;often had aggressively low valuations when they were first issued&#8221; and could &#8220;create issues at an IRS audit.&#8221;   Salmon proposes instead that Romney loaded his IRAs  with his own shares in Bain, of which he remained sole owner and CEO until 2002.  Salmon seems to be suggesting it was not just at the beginning, when he could likely reasonably claim a zero value, but annually thereafter:  he notes that &#8220;Romney would have had every incentive to keep the official valuation of Bain Capital low for many years, since the lower Bain Capital was wroth, the more of it he could put into his retirement accounts every year.  Again, the IRS might well be interested in the valuation techniques Romney used for  the purposes of his retirement account contributions.  And then &#8230; when Romney left Bain, he would have switched from minimizing Bain Capital&#8217;s official value to maximizing it.&#8221;  Id. </p>
<p>Another theory mentioned in the article is the tendency of investors in partnerships to undervalue interests when first putting them into an IRA, under the argument [labelled as &#8220;dubious&#8221; by Salmon, since all securities represent future income] that partnership interests merely represent future income, not current value.  Salmon notes that an &#8220;aggressive tax lawyer&#8221; might make such an approach &#8220;possible.&#8221;<br />It is likely that the retirement accounts were funded early on with Romney&#8217;s shares in Bain, before it was obvious for tax purposes that it would be a hugely profitable enterprise.  Thus, it would seem that Romney would benefit measurably from transparency here, since there is otherwise reasonable cause for continuing speculation about potential intentional undervaluations of contributed assets.</p>
<p>There are many other questions voters could reasonable explore about the way such an ultra wealthy presidential candidate shares the burden of taxation with ordinary voters, such as how much of Romney&#8217;s income is consistently earned in carried interest, dividends, and capital gains, all of which enjoy an extraordinarily favorable preferential tax rate under the Bush tax cuts, or how much of Romney&#8217;s income is outright excluded under generous tax expenditure provisions governing certain financial products purchased primarily (or exclusively) by the rich, such as muni bonds.  A voter might also like to see how the 1999 through 2002 tax returns show income from <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/tax-policy-center-on-cutting-tax-preferences-to-lower-tax-rates-aka-romneys-plan.html">Bain Capital</a>, during the period that Romney remained CEO and signed off on important SEC and tax documents but now claims he was retroactively retired and therefore completely out of the loop on the very deals and decisions he was signing off on.  (Would you want to invest in that business if you knew that about it at the time?) </p>
<p>Romney says he won&#8217;t release any more tax returns.  His adviser says no matter how many he released, it wouldn&#8217;t be enough.  See David Muir, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/romney-adviser-no-matter-how-many-tax-returns-romney-releases-it-wont-be-enough/">Romney Adviser: No Matter How Many Tax Returns</a>, ABC News.com (July 16, 2012).  That excuse for nonrelease is clearly just that&#8211;an excuse.  Nobody demands a lifetime of returns.  Romney&#8217;s father set a good precedent with 12 years, which would be especially reasonable here since it would show Romney&#8217;s returns for those disputed turn of the century years.  <br />Romney seems to be saying just &#8220;trust me&#8221; that everything is above board and everything filed correctly and that voters have no reason to be interested in any of the details of how he holds his assets or how he manages them or what he claims about his various activities on his tax returns. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s a little like his assertion that voters don&#8217;t have any reason to have questions about his &#8220;retroactive retirement&#8221; from Bain Capital, for which he signed federally required SEC and tax forms as sole shareholder and CEO for years after he now claims he had quit paying any attention to company decisions.  Clearly, voters should have an interest in assessing for themselves the extent of Romney&#8217;s offshoring, the way he has filed on his expensive hobbies, and whether those filings&#8211;even if they are entirely accurate, as hopefully they are&#8211; give him tax advantages that ordinary people have no access to.  </p>
<p>It is telling that even staunch right-winger George Will &#8220;slammed&#8221; Romney on this issue, saying &#8220;Romney &#8216;must have calculated that there are higher costs in releasing them.'&#8221; George Stephanopoulos, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/george-will-matthew-dowd-blast-romney-for-not-releasing-tax-returns/">George Will, Matthew Dowd Blast Romney for not Releasing Tax Returns</a>, ABC News.com (July 15, 2012).<br />After all, <strong>in 2008 McCain apparently requested&#8211;and received&#8211;two decades&#8217; worth of Romney tax returns as part of the Veep vetting process</strong>.  George Stephanopoulos, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/07/george-will-matthew-dowd-blast-romney-for-not-releasing-tax-returns/">George Will, Matthew Dowd Blast Romney for not Releasing Tax Returns</a>, ABC News.com, July 15, 2012 (noting that Romney reportedly provided 23 years of tax returns to the McCain campaign in 2008). </p>
<p>The fact that McCain commented today that his choice of Sarah Palin over Romney had nothing to do with anything on the returns but rather with Palin&#8217;s superior candidacy is irrelevant, since we cannot know whether the campaign could or did make a thorough analysis of those returns or how they weighed any issues they saw (or didn&#8217;t see).  See  <a href="http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/17/mccain-palin-was-better-vp-choice-than-romney-in-2008/">McCain: Palin was better VP choice than Romney in 2008</a>, CNN, July 17, 2012.   <strong>What any voter can reasonably say is this:  If it was reasonable for McCain to view more than a couple of years of tax returns to reach an assessment of potential issues that might affect the electibility of the man (presumably issues relating to character, honesty, business and investment skills, philosophy, and patriotism), then it is also reasonable for American voters to do the same.</strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-its-past-time-for-financial-and-tax-transparency.html">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-its-past-time-for-financial-and-tax-transparency.html</a></p>

                                <p><i>by Run 75441</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />“Second Verse, the Same as The First&#8221;<br /><i><br /></i><br /><i>The story never seems to change . . .</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />
<blockquote>When you say that the high income earners, the top 20 percent, pay 90 percent of the taxes, what should they pay, 99 percent? These are the people who have enough money to invest in businesses and to create jobs.” The tax increase that Obama is proposing “falls directly on those job creators,” Senator Kyl said.&#8221; <i><a href="http://nbcpolitics.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/07/15/12753063-can-us-economy-tolerate-a-tax-increase-in-2013?lite">Can U.S. economy tolerate a tax increase in 2013?</a></i></p></blockquote>
<p>The vast majority of the upper quintile in Household Taxable Income does not make >$250,000 in AGI. Yet since 2001, the Republicans would have us believe that 3% of the taxpayers are the same as 20% of the taxpayers and that quintile makes > than $250,000. It is a lie and Senator Kyl needs to retract his blathering. </p>
<p>What is laughable about Senator Kyl statement is the Speaker of the House repudiates his statement here:<br />BOB SCHIEFFER: Do you quarrel with that figure? Is that a right figure or a wrong figure? </p>
<p>BOEHNER: Well, it may be three percent, but it&#8217;s half of small business income. Because, obviously, the top three percent have half of the gross income for those companies that we would term small businesses. And this is why you don&#8217;t want to punish these people at a time when you have a weak economy. <i></i><a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/09/boehner_concedes_only_three_pe.html"><i>Boehner concedes only three percent of small businesses affected by extending tax cuts.</i></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>3% = 20%? Not likely and this is another example of the Republicans attempting to confuse the taxpayers. Even &#8220;<i>Joe- The-Plumber</i>&#8221; got it wrong; but then, why would a plumber have any greater knowledge then a Senator? At least there is an excuse for Joe.</p>
<p>So would taxing the upper 3% of the Taxable Household Incomes more hurt the economy? Not likely and it would correct the 2001/2003 skewing of taxes to this income group by President George Bush. What Bush did is without precedent in political history and is something not even Hoover attempted.</p>

                                <p>I noticed that the notion of income inequality and consequences was described outside the box in this article in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/us/two-classes-in-america-divided-by-i-do.html?emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y">NYT</a>.  Several ideas struck me about the article.  How people can work side by side with such little connection in their lives is instructive.  The sense of &#8216;commons&#8217; is missing from the article could be instructive in high lighting how the two women see their obligations and options, but another follow up could help instruct  us.  We tend to act on our own perceived stories&#8217; to determine these choices. :</p>
<blockquote><p>But a friendship that evokes parity by day becomes a study of inequality at night and a testament to the way family structure deepens class divides. Ms. Faulkner is married and living on two paychecks, while Ms. Schairer is raising her children by herself. That gives the Faulkner family a profound advantage in income and nurturing time, and makes their children statistically more likely to finish college, find good jobs and form stable marriages. </p>
<p>The economic storms of recent years have raised concerns about growing inequality and questions about a core national faith, that even Americans of humble backgrounds have a good chance of getting ahead. Most of the discussion has focused on labor market forces like falling blue-collar wages and lavish Wall Street pay. </p>
<p>But striking changes in family structure have also broadened income gaps and posed new barriers to upward mobility.</p></blockquote>
<p>The advantage of comparing is to personalize and give life to &#8216;trends&#8217; in our social fabric. The disadvantage of using real examples  is that readers may trivialize the significance of a trend by making pronouncements on individual morality and choices and not look at real trends.  Often little is offered for the psychological reasons for choices other than &#8220;shoulda known better&#8221;.  Individual choices are of course tremendously important, but fail to explain the much larger trends. </p>
<p>The significant growing necessity of having two paychecks to raise a family is mentioned, and also the type of jobs women tend to get at lower pay compounding the difficulty of making enough money. Also mentioned is Ronald Reagan&#8217;s earned income credit to help alleviate what could have been much more severe poverty. There was no mention of medicaid, and no mention of what state the two women lived in. Not mentioned is the profound decrease in the labor participation rate for male &#8216;blue collar&#8217; workers and subsequent dislocations  (lower wages for men were given slight mention).</p>
<p>One important  thought is that a significant number of people have dropped out of the &#8216;middle class&#8217;.  </p>

                                <p>by Mike Kimel</p>
<p> A Partial Review of <i>Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box</i><br />by Bob Deitrick and Lew Goldfarb</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, Michael Kanell of the Atlanta Journal Constitution and I wrote <ital>Presimetrics.</ital>  In it, we looked at how Presidents did on a wide range of issues &#8211; everything from abortions to the national debt.  We measured performance the same way for every issue &#8211; looking at how things changed from right before an<br />administration took office to right before it left office, and in each case, we got the data from the most objective source available.  Our approach was imperfect, but by maintaining consistency in how we approached each issue, we tried to be as unbiased as possible.  And on many issues, we found that Presidents did well tended to follow similar policies to other Presidents that did well on the same issues,<br />and likewise, the Presidents who did poorly on the issues also tended to have similar policies to other Presidents who did poorly on the issues.</p>
<p>The book got virtually no press so almost nobody ever heard of it, and it didn&#8217;t sell all that well, which is obviously too bad for both me and Michael Kanell.  But what I think is too bad for most Americans is<br />that the notion of trying to put an objective measure on the performance of our politicians hasn&#8217;t caught on.  Sure, there are the various &#8220;think tanks&#8221; purporting to do just that, but they seem to start with a conclusion and work their way backward to justify that conclusion.  I find that sort of thing less than useful.</p>
<p>As a result, I was pleased to hear from reader Susan M. about a new book entitled <i><ital>Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box: How the </ital><ital>Performance of OUR Presidents Has Impacted YOUR Wallet</ital></i> by Bob<br />Deitrick and Lew Goldfarb.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p> I didn&#8217;t find a copy at my local bookstore, so I ordered a copy online and it just came in the mail. I&#8217;ve read through the first two chapters already, its an easy, interesting and informative read.  It ranks Presidents on their economic performance (from the perspective of the national economy, individuals&#8217; wealth, and business prosperity), and then comes up with an overall ranking.</p>
<p>The rankings produced by Deitrick and Goldfarb in <ital>Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box</ital> come out a bit different from those Michael Kanell and I produced in <ital>Presimetrics</ital> as they don&#8217;t use all of the same measures we employ (and vice versa), but the conclusions they reach aren&#8217;t that different.  Provided you aren&#8217;t<br />deliberately torturing it, on average the data says what the data says.  Whether or not you read <ital>Presimetrics</ital>, I heartily recommend <ital>Bulls Bears and the Ballot Box</ital>.  The world will be very different if we start following the spirit of books like this and making an effort to measure the performance of our leaders as objectively as possible&#8230;  and then holding our leaders accountable for their performance or lack thereof.</p>

<p>What is Mitt Romney Hiding? </p>
<p>Mitt Romney has so far released <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/01/jon-stewart-delivers-goods-on-mitt.html">only one year</a> of tax returns (2010), plus an estimate for 2011. This stands in stark contrast to his father, Michigan Governor George Romney, who released 12 years of tax returns when he began running for President in 1967. As his father said at the time, &#8220;One year could be a fluke.&#8221; So the questions remain about what is in Romney&#8217;s older returns.<br />    <br />Two stories this week and last have ratcheted up the pressure. One is a recent web exclusive for &#8220;The Last Word with Laurence O&#8217;Donnell&#8221; where <a href="http://thelastword.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/27/12444118-questions-linger-over-romneys-tax-history">David Cay Johnston</a> has five questions for Romney that can only be answered with his tax returns. The other is a <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/08/investigating-mitt-romney-offshore-accounts">blockbuster story</a> by Nicholas Shaxson (h/t <a href="http://livewire.talkingpointsmemo.com/entries/vanity-fair-looks-into-romneys-offshore-finances">TPM</a>) in the new <i>Vanity Fair</i> on the shadowy world of Romney&#8217;s tax havens. Together, they put a laser-like focus on the finances of the man who could become our 45th President.<br />    <br />Johnston is a well-known former <i>New York Times</i> reporter, Pulitzer Prize winner, and the author of the major books <i>Perfectly Legal</i> and <i>Free Lunch</i>. If you don&#8217;t have time to watch his 3:45 video, here are the five questions:<br />    <br />&#8220;1. Did you buy any illegal or gray area tax shelters?    <br />&#8220;2. Did an IRS audit ever uncover serious problems with any of your tax returns?    <br />&#8220;3. Did you make use of offshore vehicles to defer, or avoid paying, federal income taxes?    <br />&#8220;4. Did you take advantage of any tax strategies that the IRS did not uncover in audits?    <br />&#8220;5. Did you fully tithe to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints every year and take a deduction on your tax return that shows that?&#8221;    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>These are important questions. We know that Governor Romney has had a Swiss bank account, as well as money in <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/05/obama-campaign-maps-romneys-tax-havens.html">other tax havens</a> like the Cayman Islands, Luxembourg, Bermuda, and Ireland. Romney&#8217;s answer to any question about his taxes has basically been, &#8220;Trust me.&#8221; But the guy&#8217;s running for President, <a href="http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/10/mitt_romney_im_running_for_office_for_petes_sake_i_cant_have_illegals.php">for Pete&#8217;s sake</a>. He owes us more than that.<br />    <br />Shaxson, a researcher for the <a href="http://www.taxjustice.net/cms/front_content.php?idcatart=2&#038;lang=1">Tax Justice Network</a> and author of the book <a href="http://treasureislands.org/"><i>Treasure Islands</i></a>, asks us to consider the possibility that maybe not everything Romney has done tax-wise has been legal. He opens with a story told by a former Bain employee about how Romney encouraged him to lie to get secret information on competitors. There is, of course, the fact that Romney has funds parked in numerous tax havens and the fact that his supposedly &#8220;blind&#8221; trust invested in a business started by Romney&#8217;s son Tagg, and the fact that he has $102 million in his IRA despite a contribution limit of $2000 per year for the entire 15 years Romney ran Bain. Obviously nothing to see here&#8230;<br />    <br />The standard answer of the Romney campaign to all this is that he always followed the law. As <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/01/jon-stewart-delivers-goods-on-mitt.html">Jon Stewart</a> had to point out since the major media did not, Romney did plenty to affect the law he was supposedly &#8220;just following,&#8221; including his defense of the &#8220;covered interest&#8221; tax loophole that let him treat his fees at Bain as if they were capital gains (15% tax) rather than wages (35% tax). All perfectly legal and as Johnston points out in his book by that name, that is the real scandal.<br />    <br />Further, Shaxson reveals that an early filing of the original Bain Capital fund in 1984 showed that many of its foreign investors were routed through tax havens and that at least one was a notorious financial criminal, Robert Maxwell. Thus, Bain helped foreigners take advantage of the fact that the United States has set itself up as a tax haven for non-citizens (see also <a href="http://www.relooney.info/0_New_8887.pdf">Jason Sharman&#8217;s paper</a> on setting up anonymous companies in the U.S. and elsewhere; h/t <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/files/67ti0069.pdf">Robert Kudrle</a>). Shaxson quotes Rebecca Wilkins of Citizens for Tax Justice, “It is shocking that a presidential candidate should think that is O.K.” for Bain to service the likes of Robert Maxwell.<br />    <br />The bottom line is that there is a lot of unsettling information in what investigators have so far been able to piece together about Romney&#8217;s finances. The easiest way for Governor Romney to put to rest what his campaign described to Shaxson as &#8220;unfounded allegations and insinuations&#8221; would be to release his tax returns. Yet he has not done so and shows no sign of changing his mind. <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/07/ill_just_say_it_i.php?ref=fpblg">Josh Marshall</a> calls the questions &#8220;kryptonite&#8221; and thinks Romney will come under a lot of pressure to release more tax returns. Let&#8217;s hope so. The guy&#8217;s running for President, for Pete&#8217;s sake. </p>

<p>Lost Output Over $3 Trillion And Rising </p>
<p>Still traveling, so just a quick post, but this really can&#8217;t be emphasized enough. Andrew Fieldhouse at the Economic Policy Institute <a href="http://www.epi.org/blog/failure-stimulate-recovery-costing-trillions/">reports</a> that the Congressional Budget Office now has cumulatively reduced its estimate of 2017 gross domestic product by 6.6% since the beginning of the recession in December 2007. As Fieldhouse points out, that doesn&#8217;t sound like much, but when it&#8217;s 6.6% of a $15 trillion economy, we are looking at about $1 trillion (with a &#8220;T&#8221;) of lost income in 2017. To put it another way, that is well over $3000 of income per person that year. That is on top of $3 trillion in potential GDP already lost since the recession began, according to Fieldhouse.    </p>
<p>The culprit, of course, is the lack of further stimulus to the economy. After the <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/09/05/on-the-inadequacy-of-the-stimulus/">totally inadequate</a> $800 billion stimulus package in 2009, we have had essentially nothing. At the end of 2011, Republicans <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-30/congress-passes-two-month-u-s-payroll-tax-cut-extension.html">had to be shamed</a> into approving a payroll tax cut they previously favored. Indeed, as Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institute and the Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute have pointed out, it is not the case that both parties are getting more partisan. As they put it, &#8220;Let&#8217;s just say it. <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-30/congress-passes-two-month-u-s-payroll-tax-cut-extension.html">The Republicans are the problem</a>.&#8221; It is the Republicans in Congress who are blocking further stimulus measures. Electing a new Congress that will not pass a stimulus bill will cost Americans thousands of dollars out of their pockets.    </p>
<p>We are a long way away from <strike>George Wallace </strike>Will Roger&#8217;s famous claim that there was not &#8220;a dimes&#8217; worth of difference&#8221; between the two parties. </p>

Because of the inability to agree, healthcare reform is aflame with controversy and in SCOTUS waiting for a decision on its constitutionality. Stimulating the economy languishes between cutting taxes for the rich in income to create jobs and another Federal Stimulus Package to do the same. Reducing the deficit cannot be done without raising taxes on the rich in income or cutting programs for the poor and the middle class. Do we spend to increase defense beyond economic growth or do we cut programs providing for people when the economy is struggling? Actions in Congress about what to do on anything have boiled down to roadblocks tossed up with every suggestion and criticism with no alternatives. Hence, action is delayed or never taken. </p>
<p>Where there are more deals occurring in the formerly smoky back rooms needing conclusion in the openness of Congressional halls, the Democrats and the Republicans can openly agree upon one thing to fix and take swift action to resolve. Two political heavyweights of Congress who cannot get it right or agree on anything when it comes to the economy and the welfare of the people are capable of agreeing on one thing . . . establishing a federal commission to fix the sport of Boxing and strip the states of the ability to oversee it. So much for state rights when it comes to sports and entertainment.</p>
<p><i>&#8220;Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who boxed while at the U.S. Naval Academy, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., a former middleweight boxer, are pushing the measure establishing the U.S. Boxing Commission, an entity that would carry out federal boxing law, work with the industry and local commissions and license boxers, promoters, managers and sanctioning organizations.&#8221; http://msn.foxsports.com/boxing/story/US-Senators-John-McCain-Harry-Reid-introduce-US-Boxing-Commission-legislation-after-Manny-Pacquiao-Timothy-Bradley-061812</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />As former VP Cheney once said; &#8220;<i>Finally, something for us!</i>&#8221; We can all feel good about this one.</p>
