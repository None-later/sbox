<p>The two luckiest people in American politics today are Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.  Each is running against a politician whose accomplishments while an elected head of the executive branch are a disappointment even to most of his own supporters.  If they were running against anyone else, they&#8217;d probably both go down in defeat, but considering who each of them is running against, it&#8217;s hard to imagine how either of them could lose.</p>

<p>Variations on &#8220;Only Nixon Can Go to China&#8221;</p>
<p>This is not a short post. Be forewarned. </p>
<p>A few years ago, I co-authored a book called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Facts-Presidents-Measure-Issues/dp/B005HKSK8M/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1337806400&#038;sr=1-1">Presimetrics</a> with Michael E. Kanell, a reporter for the Atlanta Journal Constitution. In the book, we tried to take an objective look at how Presidents performed on a wide range of issues &#8211; everything from abortion to the national debt. To achieve that objectivity, we did two things. The first was to always get data from the most objective source we could find. Thus, when looking at the murder rate, we obtained our data from the FBI. The second thing we did to try to maintain objectivity was to treat each series exactly the same way &#8211; looking at how the series changed from right before a President took office to right before he left office. </p>
<p>We got almost no press and the book didn&#8217;t do well &#8211; perhaps in part because we tried so hard to keep our opinions and biases in check. Additionally, the book had plenty in it to anger everyone, regardless of their political persuasion. (Yes, more often than not, the facts have a liberal bias&#8230; but on a few issues near and dear to liberal hearts, they don&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>Still, I learned a lot from working on the book. And while Presimetrics is about facts, I want to talk about something subjective. As the old saw goes, only Nixon can go to China. But there&#8217;s a corollary &#8211; once Nixon goes to China, everyone else can.</p>
<p>And there have been plenty of visits to China in the past few decades. Depending on your political views, you might like some and not others but whatever you might think of them, each of them has created a precedent.</p>
<p>Once the country got used to top marginal rates in the 90 percent range, only an economically liberal President could cut tax rates, particularly since the previous time the country had undergone significant tax cuts (from 75% in 1920 down to 24% in 1929) we had the mother of economic disasters. But once LBJ did cut the top tax rate from 90% to 70%, the door was opened and it took only a few decades for us to reach a point where top rates of 39% are described as socialism.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The next Democrat in the Oval Office, Jimmy Carter, set other precedents that affect us today &#8211; perhaps the biggest of which was deregulation. Nixon himself visited at least one other China &#8211; there may have been politics behind it, but he created the EPA and made the environment a legitimate issue. The air is cleaner, and rivers aren&#8217;t on fire in Ohio any more as a result of that particular visit to China. </p>
<p>Sometimes going to China only applies to one party. The Republican Party used to be somewhat pacifist, or at least non-interventionist. The leading candidates for the Republican nomination for President in January1940 &#8211; Taft, Vandenberg &#038; Dewey &#8211; were all isolationists. Wilkie, the eventual nominee, was all over the map, but a big part of his campaign was accusing FDR of having a secret plan to get the US into WW2. </p>
<p>The first post-WW2 Republican President, Ike, sent advisers to Vietnam but little more. His military policy seemed to be maintaining the &#8220;status quo&#8221; to the point where he slapped down the British, French, and Israelis over the Suez. Ike also famously warned America of the threat posed by the military-industrial complex. The next Republican President, Nixon, pulled out of the Vietnam War. It wasn&#8217;t until Reagan invaded Grenada that it became kosher for Republicans to militarily intervene in other countries, but since then, Republican Presidents have given us Panama, Gulf War 1, Afghanistan, and Iraq. If the last two had been successful, you could bet American troops would be sitting in military bases in Iran today. <br />Here&#8217;s another single Party visit to China&#8230; after WW2, every single President until Gerald Ford presided over a decrease in the national debt as a share of GDP.</p>
<p>That changed with Ford&#8230; and every single Republican President beginning with Ford increased the national debt as a percentage of GDP. Each and every single one: Ford, Reagan, Bush 1 and Bush 2. A look at Romney&#8217;s economic plan makes it obvious he would fit right in. (If you have any doubts on that point, note that he&#8217;s already signed up both Greg Mankiw and Glenn Hubbard as &#8220;economic advisers&#8221; and then go back and check on their record.)</p>
<p>For a few reasons, increasing the debt wasn&#8217;t a precedent for Democrats &#8211; and both Carter and Clinton paid down debt, but now, with Obama laying a new course (it&#8217;s one thing to increase the debt, it&#8217;s a whole other story when that debt is expanded mostly by bailing out industries that have behaved irresponsibly), perhaps we can expect both parties to act like drunken sailors going forward. </p>
<p>Obama has been visiting other Chinas too. Despite LBJ&#8217;s tax cuts, in recent decades Democrats have concluded that tax cuts might not be good for the economy when tax rates are &#8220;too low.&#8221; (Not an unreasonable assumption &#8211; the top marginal tax rates fell from 75% to 24% between 1920 and 1929, and we all know how that turned out. Most of us also remember the last time top marginal rates dipped below 30%.) Obama has made it clear that he believes that low taxes are good for the economy, and the only reason he might consider raising the top marginal rate is because &#8220;we can&#8217;t afford it.&#8221; </p>
<p>Obama has also perfected a new political technique for Democrats &#8211; the pre-emptive surrender from a position of strength. The fact that he faces an argumentative Congress is not an excuse &#8211; he was doing it even when his own party controlled both houses of Congress! Besides, Clinton had an obstreperous Congress to deal with too, and he generally triangulated his way toward whatever he wanted. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a China that Obama can go to that Bush 2 wanted to visit but couldn&#8217;t&#8230; &#8220;fixing&#8221; Social Security. Obama has already laid some of the ground work, what with the payroll tax cut as stimulus, the Social Security commission, and some other odd noises coming out of his mouth. Expect more reluctant progress &#8220;fixing&#8221; Social Security from a second Obama term than Romney would manage, despite Romney&#8217;s enthusiasm for that sort thing.</p>
<p>Which leads us to one more extension of the Nixon going to China rule&#8230; a visit to China doesn&#8217;t count if it gets immediately repudiated. The Bush 1 tax hikes were immediately repudiated by Republicans. Reagan almost did just that with the Department of Education (created by Jimmy Carter), but then he appointed the wrong flunky to oversee its destruction. </p>
<p>Obama, on the other hand, seems to have not refuted, but rather continued the new precedents set by GW Bush. Homeland Security, spying on Americans, security theater in airports, economic stimulus geared toward rescuing the worst offenders at whatever cost, refusal to hold anyone accountable for what would normally be considered criminal behavior during the financial meltdown, keeping tax rates low, etc., etc., etc., etc. Other than the low taxes, many of these policies would have been a stretch for Republicans pre-GW, but it is pretty clear that Romney wouldn&#8217;t reverse course on any of them. The Republican Party&#8217;s precedent has been established and confirmed. It won&#8217;t be changing. </p>
<p>On the other hand, in theory, Democrats can still go back to being in favor of balanced budgets, higher taxes, more spending on social issues, and accountability for white collar crime. The Democrats can still go back to favoring policies intended to benefit the little guy. (I note, as per Presimetrics, I note that intention doesn&#8217;t always make something true in reality and some of the recipes Democrats traditionally follow don&#8217;t work, just as some of the recipes Republicans traditionally follow don&#8217;t work.)<br />But these are all approaches that run counter to what Obama has been doing. If Obama&#8217;s policies aren&#8217;t repudiated quickly, they become precedent, carved in stone. From a practical perspective, the trip to China has to be untaken now, or not at all. </p>
<p>My conclusion from all of this is a very contrarian one: if you voted for Obama in 2008, you will be best-served voting against him in 2012. On the other hand, if you voted against Obama in 2008, you will be best-served voting for him 2012. And yes, I&#8217;m serious, though I don&#8217;t expect too many people to believe me. <br />&#8212;<br />This post was written in response to <a href = "./<a href=/index.html">this</a>.</p>

<p>Guest post: Basics: How Overrepresented Are Rural and Low-Population States? </p>
<p>We all kinda sorta know it: rural and small states are overrepresented in the Senate and, to a lesser extent, the Electoral College.This has deep roots in American history, of course: when the United States Constitution was drafted, small states demanded the Senate, with two votes for every state, to guarantee they would not be overwhelmed by the larger states politically. But today, when we have much greater population differences among states than in 1787, this takes on much more anti-democratic significance than it did then. Because each state has two Senators, political changes favoring the middle class are much harder to achieve than if everyone in the country were equally represented, in a mathematical sense, in Congress. Moreover, with the existence of the filibuster (<a href="http://www.scpr.org/news/2012/05/15/32437/lawsuit-tries-dump-filibuster/">recently challenged in court</a> by Common Cause), the effect of this overrepresentation is substantially magnified. But how big is the effect after the 2010 Census?</p>
<p>Under the Senate&#8217;s filibuster rules, 41 Senators can block debate on Senate bills and nomination confirmations. So the first question is what percentage of the 50 states&#8217; population do the 21 smallest states have. The 2010 Census showed the states to have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._states_and_territories_by_population">308.1 million</a> (all quoted figures are subject to slight rounding error) population, with the smallest 21, from Wyoming&#8217;s 564,000 to Iowa&#8217;s 3 million, having a total of 34.8 million, or just 11.3% of the 50-state population. In theory, Senators representing those states could mount a successful filibuster. Of course, this is unrealistic, since some small states are heavily Democratic, such as Vermont, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and Delaware. Even Montana currently has two Democratic Senators.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Another way to look at the filibuster is to ask what percentage of the 50-state population is represented by the 41 Republican Senators from the least populous states. The answer takes the actual population of states with any Republican Senators, except Texas (Cornyn and Hutchison), Florida (Rubio), Illinois (Kirk), Pennsylvania (Toomey), and Ohio (Portman). The population of the states represented by the other 41 Republican Senators is 104.7 million, or 34.0% of the population of the 50 states. Thus, states with just a third of the country&#8217;s population can block legislation or Presidential nominations. With the recent skyrocketing use of the filibuster in the Senate, this is profoundly undemocratic.    </p>
<p>Turning to the Electoral College, we can again see the effect of having a minimum of two Senators regardless of population, which means that each state (and the District of Columbia) has a minimum of three electors in the Electoral College. For example, the Real Clear Politics <a href="http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/2012_elections_electoral_college_map.html">Electoral College map</a> lists just 11 states and the District of Columbia as likely Obama, whereas 17 states are likely Romney. Even though the likely Obama states have more electoral votes than the likely Romney states (161 to 131), 6 of the Democratic states have double-digit electoral votes whereas only two of the Republican states do, underlining how Romney benefits from the overrepresentation of rural states.</p>
<p>Finally, remembering the 2000 election, where President Bush was awarded more electoral votes despite losing the popular vote nationally, we can ask what the minimum percentage of population for the 50 states plus DC is needed to win the Electoral College. To answer this question, I tallied from the bottom to see how many states were required to top 270 electoral votes. According to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_electoral_votes_by_US_state">Wikipedia</a> (as I tell my students, only a potentially reliable source for non-controversial information, like this), you have to have New Jersey to top 270, but it actually takes you to 282. So I subtracted three Democratic states (DE, VT, and DC) with 3 electoral votes as well as Montana&#8217;s 3 electoral votes (since it&#8217;s the most competitive of the remaining states with 3 EVs) to get down to 270. The 37 remaining states have only 45% of the nation&#8217;s population eligible to elect the President. Yet theoretically they could do just that.</p>
<p>This post has merely scratched the surface of the deep historical and constitutional questions that have led to Wyoming&#8217;s 564,000 people having as many Senators as California&#8217;s 37.7 million. The rural bias of the Senate and Electoral College make major political changes difficult to achieve, yet it is even more difficult to imagine that they could possibly be fundamentally altered, especially the Senate. Still, it is worth reflecting on these imbalances in order to understand the shortcomings that exist in American democracy.</p>

<p>Another Romney/Bain Firm Got Subsidies (Then Closed a Plant)</p>
<p> The <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/content/under-romney-bain-received-millions-tax-breaks-dade-behring-it-laid-hundreds">reports</a> (via <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/05/15/1091874/-The-Bain-Way-Take-millions-in-job-creation-tax-subsidies-then-turn-around-and-lay-off-hundreds?showAll=yes">Jed Lewison</a>) that another Bain-owned company, Dade Behring, was a recipient of $7.1 million in subsidies from Puerto Rico and the federal government the year before it laid off 300 workers there. A common problem with many subsidized projects, it took the money and ran without any consequences.<br />    <br />As I have pointed out before, another Bain-owned company, <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/01/mitt-romneys-steel-dynamics-took.html">Steel Dynamics</a>, received at least $95 million in incentives from state and local governments in Indiana, for two separate investments. In fact, this exceeds the $85 million Bain made in profit from the firm.    </p>
<p>Now we have a third example of Bain-owned companies getting government subsidies. For a candidate who claims to be about private enterprise, Romney clearly doesn&#8217;t walk the walk. As Jed Lewison has <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/01/13/1054354/-Mitt-Romney-s-favorite-success-story-took-millions-in-government-aid">noted before</a>, it&#8217;s clear that when Romney talks about crony capitalism, he&#8217;s talking about himself.</p>
<p>How many other government subsidies are in Bain&#8217;s past? Inquiring minds want to know. </p>

<blockquote><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/10/news/economy/romney-defense-spending/index.htm">Charles Riley</a> of CNNMoney has a must see graph showing how defense spending under Mitt Romney would compare to the current DOD baseline budget over the next decade. His title notes the spending over the next decade will exceed the baseline budget by more than $2 trillion. I like this: <br />
<blockquote>Romney has proposed a slew of tax cuts, and plans to cap federal spending at 20% of GDP. But in both cases, the Romney campaign hasn&#8217;t fully explained how those provisions will be paid for. The lack of detail means that Romney&#8217;s claim of moving toward a balanced budget requires a great deal of trust.</p></blockquote>
<p>But no one should trust Mitt Romney on fiscal matters. No one.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>On spending for the November Presidential elections comes this <a href="http://www2.nationalmemo.com/obama-spends-millions-more-than-gop-campaigns/">Associated Press</a> article regarding President Obama campaign:<br />
<blockquote>WASHINGTON (AP) — The costly Republican primary has been draining Mitt Romney’s wallet and giving President Barack Obama time to build an expansive campaign architecture with offices in 45 states and hundreds of employees.<br />The bad news for Obama is he’s had to start paying for all this now.<br />Obama has spent more than $135 million — more than GOP challengers Romney and Rick Santorum combined — on his re-election apparatus, according to an Associated Press analysis of Federal Election Commission records. That sets up his campaign to be larger and geographically more diverse than any of his opponents’ organizations.<br />Through the first two months of the year, Obama spent approximately $1.1 million on computer equipment, $435,000 on rent and utilities, $305,000 on telephones and $19,000 on office supplies, according to federal reports.<br />Republican contenders Romney and Santorum have been watching their expenses during the GOP primaries, relying on a fraction of the amount Obama can spend on essentials like ad spending, travel fees and utility bills. But Obama’s campaign has its eye on spending by Republican-leaning “super” political action committees, which can accept unlimited and effectively anonymous contributions from billionaires, corporations and others.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>As long as the news media devotes massive amounts of space to a <a href="http://news.firedoglake.com/2012/03/21/the-last-word-on-the-ryan-budget-a-massively-dishonest-document/">fantasy budget</a>, why can’t they turn their attention for just a minute to a more legitimate one? Sure, the Congressional Progressive Caucus’ Budget for All isn’t likely to get much more than the 100 or so votes of its members, short of what would be needed to pass the House. But the Paul Ryan budget has about as much of a chance as the Budget for All from becoming law.</p></blockquote>

<p>Rick Santorum&#8217;s tax policies and more&#8211;imposing his moralizing choices on all</p>
<p>  Rick Santorum is a man who seems to hold sincerely held religious beliefs. The problem is that he thinks everybody that matters holds (or should hold) the same beliefs that he does, or at least should be forced to live in a country that operates by the principles that follow from those beliefs.<br />Santorum has accused Obama of operating from a &#8220;phony theology&#8221; (one not based on the Bible). That suggests that Santorum thinks a president is supposed to impose a biblical theology on all presidential work&#8211;and that Santorum intends to impose his own &#8220;correct&#8221; theology if he were to be elected president. See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/us/politics/santorum-criticizes-education-system-and-obama.html">Santorum Questions Education System and Criticizes Obama</a>, New York Times (Feb. 18, 2012). That approach fits with Santorum&#8217;s idiosyncratic views on how religion is supposed to influence public life: Santorum has made a point of claiming that he does not hold with the founding principle of separation of church and state&#8211;a principle enunciated by Thomas Jefferson, ascribed to by Abraham Lincoln, and articulated splendidly by John F. Kennedy. See Joan Walsh, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/02/26/santorums_jfk_story_makes_me_want_to_throw_up/singleton/#comments">Santorum&#8217;s JFK Story Makes Me Want to Throw Up</a>, Salon.com (Feb. 26, 2012). </p>
<p>This issue is worth pointing out clearly. Here&#8217;s what Santorum said<br />
<blockquote>I don’t believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute. <strong><em>The idea that the church can have</em> no influence or no involvement in the operation of the state is absolutely antithetical to the objectives and vision of our country</strong>. (emphasis added)</p></blockquote>
<p>And here&#8217;s what the statesman Kennedy said when confronting the concerns of the Southern Baptist Convention that a Catholic in office would implement the laws under the dictate of the Pontiff in Rome rather than the U.S. Constitution.<br />
<blockquote>I believe in an America that is officially neither Catholic, Protestant nor Jewish; where no public official either requests or accepts instructions on public policy from the Pope, the National Council of Churches or any other ecclesiastical source; where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials; and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />What does Santorum&#8217;s theology look like and how will it influence public policy under a Santorum presidency? Santorum apparently thinks public schools are a bad idea (he&#8217;s likened them to &#8220;factories&#8221;) and that all children should be able to be home schooled (and indoctrinated in a parent&#8217;s religious preferences) at taxpayer cost. See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/us/politics/santorum-criticizes-education-system-and-obama.html">Santorum Questions Education System and Criticizes Obama</a>, New York Times (Feb. 18, 2012); <a href="http://santorumexposed.com/pages/issues/issues-tax.php">Santorum Exposed: why is Santorum spending your tax dollars on his family </a>(noting that Santorum took $100,000 from Pennsylvania for an online program for his home-schooled kids, even though he resided in Virginia at the time). He thinks kids get &#8220;weird socialization&#8221; in public schools. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/22/rick-santorum-kids-get-weird-socialization-in-public-schools_n_1294390.html">Rick Santorum, Kids Get Weird Socialization in Schools</a>, Huffington Post (Feb. 22, 2012). </p>
<p>We already have weakened public schools by permitting taxpayer funds to pay for &#8220;nonreligious&#8221; items at religious private schools, such as text books and transportation. Since money is fungible, that payment merely subsidizes more religious expenditure on religious education and deprives children in public schools of much needed resources to deal with the huge lingering infrastructure problems of our public school systems. We don&#8217;t need to go even further in that direction by moving religion into public schools wholesale, or moving even more children into ideological indoctrination through taxpayer-funded schooling. </p>
<p>Santorum&#8217;s theology is backward on women as well, seeming to think more women should be anchored in the kitchen with numerous progeny pulling on apron strings that signify the most satisfying role for women (in his book). One worries how that would play out in a Santorum presidency that could cut off funding for disfavored activities through executive orders, and his public statements bode ill for how it would pan out. Santorum apparently thinks the feminist revolution is bad, because it has made it harder for women to choose to stay at home. See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/us/politics/santorum-faces-questions-on-women-in-work-force.html">Santorum faces questions on women in the work force</a>, New York Times (Feb. 12, 2012).</p>
<p> In contradistinction to the importance of individuals&#8217; rights under the First Amendment, he seems to think that every religious institution should be able to impose its beliefs on its workers (no matter what <em><strong>their</strong></em> beliefs are): under Santorum, a woman working in any capacity for the Catholic Church could not be covered in her health care plan provided by her employer for contraception. See Social Issues Rule Day in Candidates Race, AP (Febl 12, 2012) (noting Santorum&#8217;s comment that the contraception rule forces churches to do something against their basic (institutional) tenets). He thinks voters should be aware of his religious faith and should consider that in determining whether to vote for him. And his religious faith doesn&#8217;t believe in birth control, so he wants to be sure that the tax code provides a huge tax exemption for each child in multi-child families&#8211;but not a refundable tax credit that would be of real use to a poor working mother with one child to care for. See Santorum letter, Raise the exemption for children, not the child tax credit, Wall St. J (Feb. 25, 2012) (claiming that he wants an $11,100 personal exemption per child for working families but is against a child tax credit that would be refundable, so is &#8220;innocent&#8221; of &#8220;expanding welfare&#8221;).</p>
<p>Santorum&#8217;s theology doesn&#8217;t seem to find it problematic when a government system systematically redistributes resources upwards to the benefit of the wealthy. His tax plan would result in zero taxation on unearned income, the primary type of income of the wealthy. Welfare for the rich is apparently fine and dandy under Rick Santorum&#8217;s version of morality.</p>

<p>Obama proposes to exempt some IRS spending on enforcement from budget cap</p>
<p>  The 2011 debt ceiling compromise, known as the Budget Control Act, establishes automatic cuts in spending for various categories if no further deal is reached to overturn them. <br />In many ways, it might be ideal to allow the Budget Control Act to come into play. It would force significant reductions in the overall amount allocated to Defense, an area that has fed incessantly on revenues since Reagan&#8217;s priority on militarization, coupled with Bush II&#8217;s preemptive wars of choice in Afghanistan and Iraq. We need to cut military spending significantly, and it will not hurt the country&#8217;s defense to do so. (It may, however, crimp the high-flying styles of some military contractors. About time, I&#8217;d say.) </p>
<p>Further, the Budget Control Act explicitly protects Social Security and Medicare, so those programs won&#8217;t be curtailed in the process. A good thing, again, since it is important for the nation to see that the fearmongering about Social Security as &#8220;insolvent&#8221; is just that. <br />But there&#8217;s at least one category of spending that an across-the-board cut makes little sense for&#8211;the spending necessary to collect tax from deadbeat/scofflaw or criminal taxpayers. The IRS enforcement budget essentially is an investment in better tax compliance, and returns more dollars to the federal fisc than it takes out. </p>
<p>Obama has recognized that, and seeks to exempt $277 million of the IRS enforcement spending from the Budget Control Act&#8217;s cuts. See the discussion <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/node/11986/">here</a> at OMB Watch (Vol. 13, No. 4, Feb. 22, 2012).<br />
<blockquote>One of the main objectives of President Obama’s fiscal year (FY) 2013 budget request for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is to reduce the &#8220;tax gap,&#8221; the difference between what taxpayers owe each year and what they actually pay. The <a href="http://community.ombwatch.org/site/R?i=AlaqEcDW7F6qTAOk_XJm_w">president’s IRS budget request</a> seeks funding increases for both taxpayer services and enforcement programs. Recognizing that a dollar spent on collecting revenue more than pays for itself, the Obama administration has proposed to exclude some IRS enforcement spending from the budget caps imposed by 2011&#8217;s debt ceiling deal (known as the <a href="http://community.ombwatch.org/site/R?i=haw2QOAnqOZ491FSd5aYWA">Budget Control Act</a>). <br />***<br />Among the enforcement programs the White House is recommending be increased to raise revenues <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/newsroom/budget-in-brief-fy2013.pdf">are</a>:
<ul>
<li>An additional $111 million to fight <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/node/10324">offshore tax evasion</a>, which the IRS estimates will bring in $6.40 for every dollar invested by FY 2015 </li>
<li>An increase of $39 million to improve international businesses’ compliance with the tax code &#8230;. The IRS estimates a return on investment of $8.80 per dollar invested </li>
<li>An additional $129 million to implement recent legislative tax changes, including new reporting requirements and certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which the IRS estimates will bring in $3.50 for every dollar invested </li>
<li>An increase of $88 million to implement the “Revenue Protection Strategy,” which allows the IRS to adjust a taxpayer&#8217;s refund if examiners catch errors. The IRS estimates this initiative will return $1.90 per dollar invested as soon as new hires reach their full potential in FY 2015 </li>
<li>An additional $35 million to <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/node/10677">continue certifying tax preparers</a>, which the IRS estimates will bring in $2.30 for every dollar invested by FY 2015 </li>
</ul>
<p>The IRS estimates that combined, these funding increases will bring in an additional $673 billion in FY 2013 alone, and, by FY 2015, an estimated $1.5 trillion in additional annual revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Sounds reasonable. The Bush effort to cut back on IRS funding was a naked gambit for a weakened watchdog that would allow more corporate tax evasion. Enforcement has paid off considerably over the past two years, as the IRS&#8217;s effort to unveil offshore bank accounts of US taxpayers has led to significant numbers of taxpayers brining those assets back onto the tax rolls. Congress should recognize the reasonableness of this request, unless it is so besotted with campaign fever that it is willing to sacrifice sound legislation to ideological obstructionism.</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/02/gop-candidates-increase-debt-across-the-board.html">GOP candidates&#8217; policies would raise federal debt by whopping trillions</a> </p>
<p>The GOP likes to pretend to take the high road, proclaiming itself to be against increasing the federal debt, running big deficits, or otherwise not running our government like a person runs their household. Pundits on the right tend to look at Greece and warn&#8211;watch out, America, you&#8217;re gonna be there next.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s a big difference in a family on a limited budget and the federal government. The government can print money to pay its bills; when people do that, it&#8217;s called counterfeiting. The amount of quantitative easing is limited, though where the limits are difficult to establish with any certainty&#8211;at some point. And there&#8217;s a big difference between the US and Greece. Unlike Greece, we have a sovereign money supply (Greece is tied to the European Union, unless it decides to break away and suffer the consequences). And unlike Greece, though our debt is high, it is still only about 70% of GDP. And lucky for us, the foreign nations who buy our debt need somewhere to put all those dollars that they&#8217;ve acquired through their cheap exports to us.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another big difference between the US and Greece. We have a long history of a stable and workable tax system&#8211;in spite of the frequent tinkering that Congress has done over the years. We have at times had politicians in office who recognize their responsibilities to the system and enact new tax laws, in spite of the intense lobbying by Big Business and wealthy interests to try to derail all tax increases. We can and should increase taxes now, especially on those most able to pay.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />So is that what the GOP candidates are proposing, after all their whining about how Democrats are fiscally irresponsible and blaming Obama for increasing our debt load? Nope, not at all. Except for Ron Paul, who wants to harshly cut every government activity, the rest of the GOP candidates have enormous tax cuts and middling spending cuts (mostly to programs that benefit ordinary Americans) and would add to the deficit by trillions of dollars, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. See <a href="http://crfb.org/document/primary-numbers-gop-candidates-and-national-debt">Primary Numbers: The GOP Canddiates and the National Debt </a>(Feb. 24, 2012). Gingrich would have the biggest increase&#8211;about $7 trillion in new debt over a two-term presidency. Santorum would increase the debt by about $4.5 trillion, and Romney would increase it by about $2.6 trillion (unless he really comes up with some offsets as promised). All three of them are likely depending on the laughable Laffer Curve idea to help them achieve their promises&#8211;the assumption that their tax cuts for the wealthy would result in more growth and therefore more tax revenues.</p>
