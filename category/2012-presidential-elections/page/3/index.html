<p>Mitt Romney&#8217;s Unintentionally Hilarious Tax Return FAQ</p>
<p> Unless you&#8217;ve been in a coma, you have certainly heard about Mitt Romney&#8217;s release of his 2011 tax returns last Friday. You no doubt know that he and his wife did <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/09/21/890451/by-romneys-own-standard-his-tax-returns-would-disqualify-him-from-the-presidency/">not claim all the charitable tax deductions</a> they were due, so their tax rate would not go below 13% of adjusted gross income. If you read <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/mitt-romney-paid-14-1-federal-tax-rate-in-2011-campaign-says.html">Bloomberg</a> or a newspaper that picked up the Bloomberg story, you know that Rafalca, the Romneys&#8217; dressage horse, has disappeared from their 2011 tax deductions. This, of course, raises the question of whether it was a legitimate deduction in 2010 (or earlier?). After all, being in the Olympics probably raised <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2012/07/19/both-left-and-right-got-the-taxes-on-the-romneys-olympic-horse-wrong/">the mare&#8217;s</a> value, making the profit motive necessary for an allowable business deduction more plausible. So why would Rafalca not be eligible to deduct in 2011 if she were eligible in 2010 and probably gained value?    </p>
<p>But have you read the <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page the Romney campaign put up about the 2011 returns and the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) summary of the Romneys&#8217; 1990-2009 taxes? You should, for the humor value, if nothing else.</p>
<p>In question 9, we learn how PwC calculated the average effective tax rate: they added the tax rate for each year, then divided by 20. This tells us almost nothing, as many observers (here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/expert-romney-may-have-paid-less-in-taxes-over-20-years-than-it-appears/2012/09/21/41b27e00-041e-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_blog.html">one</a>, h/t Think Progress) have pointed out: $50 million taxed at 10% (though <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/mitt-romney-paid-14-1-federal-tax-rate-in-2011-campaign-says.html">the campaign claims</a> it was never less than 13.7%) and $5 million taxed at 30% would yield an average tax rate of 20%, using the PwC method, when the true tax rate would be 11.8% ($6.5/$55) in this example.    </p>
<p>In the very next question, however, we learn that for the total of federal taxes, state taxes, and charitable contributions (38.49%), PwC used the proper averaging methodology! In other words, adding up all the payment dollars and dividing by the total adjusted gross income (though we don&#8217;t know what tricks he used before adjusted gross income). Why didn&#8217;t they do that for tax alone?    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In 2011, the Romneys&#8217; charitable contributions came to just over twice their federal income tax ($4 million vs. $1.9 million). If that ratio applied for the entire 1990-2009 period, that would make the federal tax portion less than 13% (even lower because I have ignored state taxes). Of course, we have no way of knowing the real rate for federal or state taxes, or charitable deductions, without seeing the actual tax returns.    <br />But wait, there&#8217;s more! Don&#8217;t forget all the offshore accounts! To do this question and answer justice, I&#8217;ll have to quote it in full:    </p>
<p>12. There are some investments that seem to be established in offshore accounts, like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. Are these investments evading taxes?    <br />Note the misdirection in the question, &#8220;evading&#8221; rather than &#8220;avoiding&#8221; taxes, which describe illegal and legal maneuvers respectively. Few people think Romney has broken the law, though <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/08/investigating-mitt-romney-offshore-accounts">Nicholas Shaxson</a> considers it to be a possibility.    </p>
<p>No, the investments by the blind trusts in funds established in the Cayman Islands or other jurisdictions are taxed in the very same way they would be if the shares were held in the US rather than through a Cayman fund. No taxes are evaded or reduced. These funds are all registered with the IRS and report all income to investors and the IRS, just like domestic funds. Whether in Bermuda or Boston or elsewhere, there is no difference in how they are taxed.</p>
<p> If this were true, why would the funds need to be organized in the Cayman Islands? Boston would be a lot more convenient. No, as <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/01/romneys-cayman-explanations-dont-tell.html">Richard Murphy</a> of Tax Research UK told me, these funds are set up to allow round tripping by U.S. investors to avoid U.S. taxes, though some foreigners may also take advantage of them. Moreover, if foreigners are exempt from U.S. taxes like the Unrelated Business Income Tax, what need do they have to invest through the Caymans except to avoid taxes at home? Finally, we know from the <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/08/lid-blowing-off-romney-tax-secrecy.html">Gawker revelations</a> that at least two Cayman funds the Romneys invested in created five blocker corporations, which are set up precisely to allow round-tripping by Americans. How can these funds be established in the Cayman Islands, etc., for any reason other than tax avoidance?</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to note that there are no offshore accounts. These are investments in funds that are organized outside the US.</p>
<p> A fund organized in a secrecy jurisdiction like the Caymans, Bermuda, or Luxembourg is offshore by definition. </p>
<p>Further, it is important to note that Governor Romney did not make these investments. Governor and Mrs. Romney&#8217;s assets are managed on a blind basis. They do not control the investment of these assets. The assets are under the control and overall management of an independent trustee.</p>
<p> We&#8217;ve known since 1994 <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-presidential-campaign/romney-criticized-kennedy-for-blind-trust-in-1994-senate-debate-video-20120127">what Romney thinks of blind trusts</a>, calling Senator Ted Kennedy&#8217;s &#8220;a ruse.&#8221; </p>
<p>Finally, the trustee did not choose where the investments were located any more than a stockholder in a Fortune 500 company chooses where that company is organized. Only the sponsor of the fund decides where it is organized. That responsibility is totally outside the control of a passive investor like Gov. Romney or the trustee of his blind trust.</p>
<p> And a stockholder can sell his shares. Has trustee Brad Malt never heard of &#8220;divestment&#8221;? I was one of thousands of people active in the late 1970s to get our universities to sell stock in companies doing business in South Africa, the &#8220;divestment movement.&#8221; While we weren&#8217;t very successful at Princeton, students and faculty at many other universities were, and some major local government funds divested from such firms, too, leading companies like Citicorp to end their South African operations. Malt could sell if he wanted to.<br />The bottom line is the &#8220;same as it ever was,&#8221; one tax system for the 1% and another one for the rest of us.</p>

<p> Romney&#8217;s Tax Views Lead to Blooper Comments Denigrating America&#8217;s Elderly and Poor</p>
<p> Most of us who follow tax issues in the news and in political campaigns are aware that GOP candidate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/08/romneys-tax-returns-what-we-do-know.html">Mitt Romney</a> has been very secretive about various items.</p>
<p>First and foremost, he has been secretive about his own extraordinary wealth:  he has refused to follow his father&#8217;s example in releasing more than a decade of tax returns and he has maintained numerous accounts offshore, including in jurisdictions that are known for banking secrecy.  This secrecy is problematic for many voters, because without those returns it is difficult to evaluate his aggressiveness in using shelters or taking controversial positions on returns to save himself tax dollars &#8211;a topic that is surely relevant to his qualification to hold the highest executive office in the land.</p>
<p>Second, he has been secretive about his plans for achieving across-the-board tax cuts of enormous benefit to the uber-rich and multinational corporations while claiming to maintain revenue neutrality.  Respected non-partisan tax analysts have concluded that his plans simply don&#8217;t add up&#8211;the &#8220;arithmetic&#8221;, as Democratic speeches noted, is against him.  When he refuses to specify just what programs he would cut while cutting taxes and increasing military expenditures, many voters are naturally suspicious that the cuts will all be taken out of the safety net&#8211;voucherization of Medicare, privatization of education funding, and even more of the deregulation that cost us so much in the 2007-8 financial crisis&#8211;while continuing the over-spending on military and various lucrative loopholes for the wealthy like the &#8220;carried interest&#8221; provision for private equity managers.</p>
<p>Third, he has been secretive about his lack of commitment to the disadvantaged in our society.  His failure to describe how he will create jobs (other than through his claim that managing vulture capital &#8220;leveraged buy-out&#8221; funds is good preparation for the presidency) suggests that he has no ideas other than the long disproven ones being pushed by the Chamber of Commerce and other business lobbying organizations&#8211;less regulation, more privatization, more reductions to earned benefits like Medicare and Social Security, and more tax provisions that favor the rich that the GOP labels&#8211;without empirical support&#8211; as the &#8220;job creators&#8221;.  But he has nonetheless tried to foster an image of caring about American people who weren&#8217;t born to the life of wealth and luxury that he&#8217;s enjoyed.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>That third point of secrecy was shattered by the revelation of a taped video of Romney comments to major donors (delivered at a May 17 fundraiser at an investment banker&#8217;s home in Boca Raton, Florida), in which Romney showed utter disdain for the large segment of the US population who ultimately do not pay any federal income taxes.  Romney called those who pay no federal income tax &#8220;dependent on government&#8221; and indicated that they see themselves as &#8220;victims&#8221;.  He concluded he&#8217;d &#8220;never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Romney&#8217;s 47% comment fairly drips with disdain and scorn for ordinary Americans, casting them, as the Mother Jones article cited above notes, as &#8220;a mass of shiftless moochers who don&#8217;t contribute much, if anything, to society.&#8221; David Corn, <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser">Secret Video: Romney Tells Millionaire Donors What He REALLY Thinks of Obama Voters</a>, Mother Jones (Sept. 17, 2012).</p>
<p>It is of a par with comments by a woman that I met at a reception in Boston over the weekend, who spewed scorn as she claimed that anybody that is on welfare or getting unemployment is just a lazy bum that wants the rest of us to hand them a living on a silver platter.  Romney&#8217;s and the woman&#8217;s comments both show absolute insularity from the real world of povery and near-poverty in America in the aftermath of Bush&#8217;s Great Recession, when able-bodied men despair of their situation in being unable to find a job, any job, and young folks grow hopeless as they fill in application after application.  Without government programs to fill in the gaps for these groups, their lives would be truly desperate.  Their non-taxpayer situation has nothing to do with lack of personal responsibility and everything to do with a society in which the economy for too long has favored the uberrich at the cost of ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>Remember that the federal income tax is specifically designed to protect taxpayers in the lower income distributions from paying federal income tax through the use of the standard deduction and personal exemptions.   That&#8217;s because Congress has always assumed that there should be a minimum below which the federal income tax does not reach.  And Congress has enacted a number of other exclusions and credits designed to ensure that the federal income tax doesn&#8217;t fall too heavily on the more vulnerable amongst us.  <br />
<blockquote>About half of those [46% of households] did&#8217;t pay [federal income taxes] because of standard deductions and personal exemptions designed to exclude subsistence levels of income from taxation.  The rest received tax breaks, including the earned income tax credit, the child tax credit and tax benefits for older Americans such as the exclusion of Social Security benefits from income.&#8221;  Richard Rubin,<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-18/romney-s-47-percent-with-no-taxes-include-elderly-poor-workers">Romney&#8217;s 47% With Not Taxes Combines Elderly with Poor Workers</a>, Bloomberg Businessweek (Sept. 18, 2012). </p></blockquote>
<p>Furthermore, most taxpayers who pay no federal income tax do pay other taxes:  state and local income, property and sales taxes eat up a substantial amount of income, as do federal payroll taxes, which often amount to the most significant tax bite for these lower-income taxpayers.  And as the Rubin article also notes, people who don&#8217;t pay income tax one year&#8211;because of returning for education, job losses, extraordinary medical expenses and other causes&#8211;come back on the tax rolls in later years when they finish studies or find work.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Romney&#8217;s remarks at the fundraiser mainly reveal an eager player in the class warfare game that the right has engaged in for the last few decades&#8211;it reflects a firm support for tax policies that redistribute upwards to the elite, at whatever cost to ordinary Americans who are disdained and even despised as irresponsible and lazy.  With CEOs making 200-400 times what their average workers make and the productivity gains contributed most especially by the workers being siphoned off for increasingly higher pay for the executives, ordinary Americans already are hurting.  Tax policies that continue the rip-off by continuing preferential rates for capital gains, providing even more preferential marginal rates for the uberrich, and eliminating worldwide taxation on multinationals will do even greater harm to ordinary Americans and the sustainability of our economy.</p>

<p>Romney <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2012/09/secret-video-romney-private-fundraiser">claims</a> that that the 47% of the people that don’t pay federal income tax are a lost cause. They are simply moochers and looters that “are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you-name-it.” They’re part of the problem, in his mind, and there is nothing he can do to help them because they refuse to help themselves. </p>
<p>But as <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/09/nontaxpayers-are-overwhelmingly-the-eldery-and-students.html">Mark Thoma shows</a>, the vast majority of people that don’t pay federal income tax (which is only just a part of federal taxes) are either students or the elderly. The elderly, in particular, do not pay income or payroll taxes on the meager payout of Social Security. </p>
<p>This from <a href="http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/the_truth_about_taxes_just_about_everyone_pays_them/">the Hamilton Project</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-j3ZC-zCWtDk/UFjA-aXt2iI/AAAAAAAABDI/DIRLukStMYk/s1600-h/clip_image001%25255B3%25255D.gif"><img alt="clip_image001" border="0" height="186" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-Hk1-pCuIa4g/UFjA-3xiZxI/AAAAAAAABDQ/XNiNAYJy5n4/clip_image001_thumb.gif?imgmax=800" title="clip_image001" width="244"></a></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The irony of this, though, is that older Americans are the group most likely to vote for Republicans! Here are <a href="http://sailerfraud.blogspot.com/2010/11/2010-election-analysis-race-sex-age.html">exit poll data</a> from the 2010 election cycle:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-T7H8lZR-Xoo/UFjA_UyK7RI/AAAAAAAABDY/fgR73scM2n4/s1600-h/clip_image003%25255B3%25255D.jpg"><img alt="clip_image003" border="0" height="149" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-uFu_BRZf_J0/UFjA_vKVZEI/AAAAAAAABDg/Hvvke-PTzH4/clip_image003_thumb.jpg?imgmax=800" title="clip_image003" width="244"></a></p>
<p>Will Romney’s attempt to characterize older folks as parasites turn them off of the GOP? I doubt it, but it’s a funny way to do outreach.</p>

<p>Bartlett: <em>Mitt Romney, Carried Interest and Capital Gains</em><br />New York Times:  <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/11/mitt-romney-carried-interest-and-capital-gains/">Mitt Romney, Carried Interest and Capital Gains</a>, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Bartlett">Bruce Bartlett</a>:<br />
<blockquote>A key reason for Mr. Romney’s low tax rate is that a very substantial amount of his income comes from capital gains – 51% in 2011 and 58% in 2010. Capital gains, no matter how large, are taxed at a maximum rate of 15%, whereas wage income can be taxed as much as 35% by the income tax plus taxes for Medicare and Social Security. The latter two are not assessed on capital gains.<br />The New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/06/opinion/more-tax-tricks-private-equity-style.html">recently commented</a> in an editorial that while the carried interest loophole is unjustified, the core problem is lower tax rates on capital gains generally. Said The Times, “As long as income from investments is taxed at a lower rate than income from work, there will be no stopping the search for ways, legal or otherwise, to pay the lower rate.”<br />The view that capital gains should be treated as ordinary income for tax purposes is one that is widely shared by liberal tax reformers. They got their wish, briefly, from 1987 to 1990 because Ronald Reagan agreed to raise the tax rate on capital gains to 28% from 20% in return for a reduction in the top rate on ordinary income to 28% from 50%, as part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986.<br />There are three big problems, however, with taxing capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>First, even if that were the case, capital gains would still be treated more beneficially, because the taxes only apply to realized gains. &#8230;<br />Second, there is a problem with inflation insofar as capital gains are concerned. Many <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2143878">academic studies</a> have shown that a considerable portion of realized capital gains simply represent inflation, rather than real increases in purchasing power. &#8230;<br />Third, it is a fact of life that those with great wealth are the principal beneficiaries of the capital gains tax preference, and they exercise influence in our political system far out of proportion to their numbers. &#8230;<br />[I]t is a pipe dream to believe that eliminating the capital gains preference is the key to fixing the carried interest loophole. It can and should be addressed by treating carried interest as ordinary income, without requiring that all capital gains be taxed as ordinary income.</p></blockquote>

<p>Whistleblower gets millions: good for compliance improvement (and makes us ask again&#8211;did Romney get amnesty?)</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Birkenfeld">Bradley Birkenfeld</a>, the UBS whistleblower who helped jumpstart the IRS&#8217;s enforcement of foreign bank account reporting and helped catch criminal tax evaders, ended up serving a relatively short prison term (for failure to be entirely forthcoming, in the case of one of UBS&#8217;s private banking customers) but also go a significant $104 million whistleblower award.  See David Kocieniewski, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/business/whistle-blower-awarded-104-million-by-irs.html">Whistle-Blower awarded $104 Million by I.R.S</a>., New York Times (Sept. 11, 2012); <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/9/12/whistleblower_brad_birkenfeld_rewarded_record_104m">Whistleblower Brad Birkenfeld Rewarded Record $104M for Exposing How UBS Helped Rich Evade Taxes</a>, DemocracyNow.org (video available); <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/2012/7/31/exhaustive_study_finds_global_elite_hiding">Exhaustive Study Finds Global Elite Hiding Up to $32 Trillion in Offshore Accounts</a>, DemocracyNow.org (July 12, 2012) (video or transcript available); <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/09/whistleblowing">Birkenfeld&#8217;s bonanza</a>, The Economist (Sept. 11, 2012).</p>
<p>As Birkenfeld&#8217;s attorney put it:<br />
<blockquote>“Today is a great day for all the honest Americans out there who work their job and pay their taxes. Today is a great day for tax fairness. Today is a terrible day for big-time tax cheats.”  <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/schumpeter/2012/09/whistleblowing">Birkenfeld&#8217;s bonanza</a>, The Economist (Sept. 11, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>The very public and very large whistleblower award should do two things:</p>
<p>1) encourage other insiders who are aware of egregious company or individual tax-evading behavior to blow the whistle and</p>
<p>2) discourage other insiders and companies from egregious company or individual tax evading behavior.<br />There have always been anonymous brown-envelope tips to the IRS from those who know what is going on but don&#8217;t want to participate in it and don&#8217;t want their competitors to gain a competitive advantage because they do.  But whistleblowers generally have access to inside information that can break the dam on enforcement.  That certainly was the case with Birkenfeld, whose information&#8211; about smuggling diamonds for UBS&#8217;s private banking clients and other means taken to help such clients avoid reporting their assets to the US government&#8211;was instrumental in increasing awareness about tax crimes and increasing the fear of God (or rather, the fear of the &#8220;revenuer&#8221;) in sophisticated, wealthy taxpayers who had been able to hide some of their assets and wealth relatively easily before.</p>
<p><em>By the way&#8211;we still do not know whether GOP presidential candidate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/whats-romney-got-to-hide-part-ii.html">Mitt Romney</a> participated in the amnesty program that was introduced in the wake of the UBS exposure of banking secrecy&#8217;s connection to tax evasion by wealthy Americans.  As most Americans know by now, Romney refuses to release his tax returns for the relevant years when he might have participated in the amnesty program to avoid criminal prosecution. </em><br /><em></em><br /><a name="more"></a><em><br /></em><br /><em> Until he does release his returns back to 2003 o4 so, there will continue to be questions regarding his taxes, as the wealthiest nominee ever with offshore holdings galore and his sole business experience being a hedge fund with numerous offshore entities and blocker corporations.  Specifically, Americans will wonder how his self-proclaimed patriotism and love of nation plays out in his ordinary decisions.  His hedge fund, Bain Capital, has also made the news as a participant in a claimed conspiracy of hedge funds to deflate the prices they pay for companies they acquire.  See Lichtblau &#038; Lattman, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/12/business/documents-depict-equity-firms-like-bain-as-colluding.html?pagewanted=all">Equity Firms Like Bain Are Depicted as Colluding</a>, New York Times (Sept. 11, 2012).   </em><br /><em><br /></em><em>Both tax evasion and price-rigging are criminal activities, so it behooves Romney to release his returns and ancillary information so Americans can assess how he practices what he preaches in terms of love of country and rule of law.  Did he report his foreign assets as required all along?  Did he invest abroad (so that any purported &#8220;job creation&#8221; activity didn&#8217;t benefit us)?  Was he still influential in Bain during the period that it began, or carried on, price-fixing agreements with other powerful hedge funds?  Americans deserve to know.</em><br /><em><br /></em>Will this lead to better compliance in the future?  One suspects that there will always be those who enjoy the game of avoiding taxes so much that they will be willing to pay to play the tax evasion games even on the harder-to-manipulate playing field created by the crackdown on banking secrecy and offshoring of funds.  But hopefully they will be fewer, and less successful! </p>

                                <p>John Quiggin writes at  <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2012/09/10/the-white-working-class/">Crooked Timber</a> on a not new discussion on what constitutes &#8220;white working class&#8221; or &#8220;whiteworkingclass&#8221; used in media descriptions.  In comments there are several who tackle the question well&#8230;.Bruce Wilder for one.  I am not sure there is a clear answer without considering geographical issues and histories, rural/city/suburb issues, and such, but has implications for who we notice as important.</p>
<blockquote><p>All became clear(or, at least, clearer) when I discovered that US political discussion uses two very different (though correlated) concepts of “working class”. The first is the more or less standard one – people who depend on wage labor (normally in manual or low-status service occupations) for their income. The second, specific to the US, and standard in most political polling, is “people without a 4-year college degree”, a class which includes such horny-handed sons and daughters of toil as Bill Gates and Paris Hilton. More prosaically, it includes lots of small business owners, and (since college graduation rates were rising until relative recently), over-represents the old.</p>
<p>Data on US voting patterns is surprisingly scarce, but Andrew Gelman has a big data set confirming the point that <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/03/23/voting-patterns-of-americas-whites-from-the-masses-to-the-elites/">Republican voting rises with income</a>&#8230;<br />&#8230;<br />As the pie chart below illustrates, the biggest group in the Republican voting base, and the group with which they do best is that of middle/high income whites without college degrees (the percentage after the group name gives the Republican share of the vote for that group). There’s nothing surprising in this, since all three variables are correlated with Republican voting. It’s the practice of calling this group “working class” that causes the confusion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Omigod Sept 4 2012 really is opposites day.  Ezra Klein made an incorrect claim of fact about health care financing.  He wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p>But I’m not going to make that argument. I’m on-record saying that trust-fund accounting is by and large a ridiculous way to look at the federal government’s finances, but both parties do it, and so Ryan isn’t committing any foul here. And within the trust-fund accounting rules, Obama is using his Medicare cuts to pay for the Affordable Care Act and Ryan is using his Medicare cuts to finance the Medicare program in the future.</p></blockquote>
<p>My amazed comment follows.    </p>
<p>I agree that trust fund accounting is absurd, but your trust fund accounting is totally wrong.  The balance of the Medicare plan A trust fund would be identical under the ACA and the Ryan budget.  There is just no difference at all.  The ACA did not take any money out of the Medicare trust fund to pay for anything.  That&#8217;s why it extended the forecast time till the fund is empty by 8 years.   </p>

<p>The ACA spending increases are, by trust fund accounting (which I agree is nonsense) separate from the Medicare spending cuts (and the Medicare tax increases).  The effect on the deficit is the sum.  The Medicaid expansion and the subsidies for insurance bought on exchanges are not at all funded by any money which would otherwise be in the Medicare plan A trust fund.   </p>
<p>Amazingly uber wonk Ezra Klein is just wrong on a health care financing fact (a meaningless one I agree but you are just wrong).</p>

<p>As the Republicans Take Tampa, Consider What a GOP Victory Would Mean for Women’s Health</p>
<p>For decades, Republicans have opposed abortion. This, we know, and so it comes as no surprise that <a href="http://crooksandliars.com/nicole-belle/mitt-romney-calls-roe-v-wade-one-dark">Mitt Romney, the Party’s presidential candidate, has called “Roe vs. Wade“ one of the darkest moments in Supreme Court history.” <strong></strong></a></p>
<p>But what some call the “war against women” is escalating. This year, the Republican platform calls for a constitutional amendment that would make abortion illegal.</p>
<p>In 1976, the GOP blueprint acknowledged that “the question of abortion is one of the most difficult and controversial of our time,” and the Party called for “a continuance of the public dialogue on abortion,” which it called a “moral and personal issue.” Just eight years ago, the preamble to the Republican platform declared: “we respect and accept that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes differing views.” But today, there is no such language in a platform that calls for “a human life amendment to the Constitution,” and declares that “abortion is detrimental to women’s health and well-being.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile Alabama, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Carolina, Oklahoma, and Ohio all have passed legislation outlawing abortion after 20 weeks, even though, as the Center for American Progress’ Emillie Openchowski points out “<a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/women/news/2012/08/23/33841/abortion-is-the-battle-but-womens-health-is-the-war">complications are sometimes discovered after this point in a pregnancy that could cause serious harm to the woman</a>. In those states, a woman would be forced to continue the pregnancy, no matter the risk to her health.” This is frightening.</p>
<p>While Republicans parade women across their Tampa stage– and avoid talking about what they have quietly embedded in the Party platform–it seems a good time to consider what a Republican victory would mean for women’s health.</p>

<h4><strong>Turning Back the Clock: Contraception</strong></h4>
<h4>Susan Faludi’s Pulitzer-prize winning 1991 book, <em>Backlash,</em> is subtitled: “The Undeclared War Against American Women.” Twenty-one years later, it seems the war is out in the open . As a recent <em>New York Times</em> editorial observes: “Having won on abortion, social conservatives are turning to birth control.”</h4>
<p>The Affordable Care Act (ACA) promises women <a href="http://mediamatters.org/research/2012/07/19/conservative-media-cover-up-support-for-contrac/187250">access to contraception without co-pays, an idea which enjoys widespread popular support–at least among women. Nationwide 80% of women voters support the idea, according to a June survey by Hart Research Associates</a>. An earlier Hart poll revealed that 77% of Catholic women and 72% Republican women approved of free birth control. By contrast, just <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">sixty percent of all men embrace the proposal</a>. Still, that’s a majority.</p>
<p>Who, then, actually <em>opposes</em> making birth control available to all women, regardless of income?<br />The extreme conservatives who now run the Republican Party have made their feelings clear. In February, House Speaker John Boehner, stood on the House floor, and promised to overturn any rule requiring employers to pay for birth control for their workers:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/domesticpolicy/as-contraception-rule-goes-into-effect-unusual-silence-from-republicans-20120801">“It must not stand and it will not stand,” delcared Boehner,</a> who believes that bosses who object to birth control should not be forced to cover contraception. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, along with Senators Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; Roy Blunt, R-Mo.; Marco Rubio;, R-Fla.; and John Thune,quickly joined in, arguing that this provision is a threat to religious freedom.</p>
<p>The right-wingers who now control the GOP seem to view contraception as a “women’s issue” that should be decided by men. Thus, at <a href="http://www.dccc.org/pages/wherearethewomen">a House Oversight Committee hearing, House Republicans convened a panel on denying access to birth control coverage with five men– and <em>no</em> women.</a></p>
<p>As for Republican presidential candidate <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/08/26/745521/romney-touts-romneycare-im-the-guy-that-got-healthcare-for-all-the-women-and-men-in-my-state">Mitt Romney, in a <em>Fox </em>interview just last Sunday, he said: “of course women have a right to use contraception”– if they can afford it. </a></p>
<p>In March Romney told a Town Hall meeting that <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/03/20/1075916/-Romney-to-Women-You-Want-Birth-Control-Vote-for-the-Other-Guy">if “a woman wants access to free birth control” she “should vote for the other guy,” </a>adding, “there are a lot of things that we have in our society that we may like,” but that government should not be paying for.” This suggests that “the Pill” is a luxury, like a $75 blouse.<br />Romney also has endorsed the “<a href="costhttp://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/03/01/435290/romney-says-he-would-oppose-blunt-bill-if-it-prevented-people-from-getting-contraception/">Blunt amendment” that would let any employer drop health insurance coverage for contraception </a>and other health services on religious or moral grounds.</p>
<p>Here we are not just talking about Catholic colleges and hospitals. President Obama is making special provisions to accommodate their concerns. But the Republican “<a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jul/31/obama-administration-sen-dems-tout-health-benefits">Blunt amendment” would go further, to include private companies such as Hercules Industries, a Denver-based heating and air conditioning company</a>.</p>
<p>Co-owner Andy Newland objects to birth control, and in July, the company obtained an injunction from a federal court, allowing it to delay complying with the law until three months after the case is decided.<br /><strong><br /></strong><strong>The Cost of Contraception</strong><br /><a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/02/08/1062855/--Anybody-can-afford-birth-control-says-clueless-Greg-Gutfield-of-Fox-News">According to Fox News’ Greg Gutfield, “Anybody can afford birth control.” </a>In July, he asked his audience, “How much more affordable can you make it? . . I mean, do we–should we start up like a ‘buy the pill’ campaign? Like ‘feed the children’ where we make sure we all adopt one woman and pay for her pills?”<br />Gutfield is, of course, wrong about the cost. In recent years, <a href="http://ww.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">birth control has become extremely expensive for low-income women</a>, even if they are insured. Co-payments for pills typically range between $15 and $50 per month, and for other contraceptive devices, such as IUDs, co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses can reach into the hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>“Since the average American woman wants to have two children,” Planned Parenthood points out, “she‘ll spend approximately five years pregnant, postpartum, or trying to have children, but 30 years trying to prevent pregnancy. <a href="http://ww.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">That can add up to thousands of dollars spent on prescription birth control.” </a><br />Little wonder that, according to a recent survey, more than one-third of American women voters have struggled with the cost of prescription birth control at some point in their lives, and, as a result, have used birth control inconsistently. Planned Parenthood reports that “this number rises dramatically among younger women, with more than half (55 percent) mentioning a time when they could not afford to use birth control consistently.”</p>
<p>Thus, “<a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/ppgnw/birth-control-matters-32835.htm">In the U.S., half of all pregnancies are unintended</a>.” Inevitably, a great many uniplanned pregnancies end in abortion. “If we are serious about reducing the unacceptably high rate of unintended pregnancies in this country, we need to get at the root cause and take practical steps to increase access to affordable birth control,” Planned Parenthood observes. <strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Without the Affordable Care Act– What Women Would Lose</strong><br />The <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/28/platform-abortion_n_1837571.html">GOP platform states that a Republican President would use his waiver authority “on his first day in office” to halt progress in carrying out the Affordable Care Act</a>. Romney has pledged to repeal health reform during his first 100 days in the White House.</p>
<p>This means that <a href="http://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2012/04/28/health-reform-a-huge-victory-for-women/">insurers selling policies in the individual market would be able to continue charging a women at least 30 percent more than they would charge a man for exactly the same policy–</a>even if the coverage did not include maternity benefits.</p>
<p>Women also would lose free access to a list of preventive services that the ACA requires that insurers offer without co-pays, and without applying deductibles.</p>
<p>For women, the essential preventive services include: free screening for cervical and breast cancer; breastfeeding support, supplies, and counseling; well-women visits, prenatal care, screening and counseling for sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV; screening for gestational diabetes; and screening and counseling for domestic partner violence.</p>
<p><strong>Planned Parenthood and Title X </strong><br />Mitt Romney has pledged that he will “get rid of” Planned Parenthood, an organization that operates nearly 800 health centers throughout the United States, offering sexual and reproductive health care for the nearly three million women and men who visit these centers each years. While helping women avoid unintended pregnancies, <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/about-us/who-we-are/planned-parenthood-glance-5552.htm">Planned Parenthood also provides roughly 770,000 Pap tests and nearly 750,000 breast exams annually</a>, along with more than four million tests and treatments for sexually transmitted infections. At sometime in their lives, one in five American women have found help at Planned Parenthood.<br />During his Sunday interview on Fox, Mitt Romney reiterated his desire to defund the organization, arguing that taxpayer dollars should not fund abortion.</p>
<p>Here is <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2011/04/08/157196/jon-kyl-90-percent-planned-parenthood-abortion">the truth: abortion constitutes only 3 percent of Planned Parenthood’s services </a>and abortion is covered by private funds. Federal dollars are not used.</p>
<p>Mitt Romney’s fiscal plan also proposes eliminating Title X—the main federal family-planning program supported by President Nixon and then-Congressman George Bush Sr. at its creation in 1970. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/us/texas-womens-clinics-retreat-as-finances-are-cut.html">Title X does not pay for abortions, but it prevents abortions and unintended pregnancies by the hundreds of thousands each year</a>. It also pays for cancer screening and some abstinence counseling for teenagers.<br />In Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry already has rejected Title X money, assuring that countless poor women in his state will be denied access to all reproductive health care, from birth-control pills to Pap smears.</p>
<p><strong>Misogyny: The Elephant in the Room </strong><br />That both Bush and Nixon supported Title X serves as a reminder of how much the Republican party has changed. As <em>New York Magazine’s</em> Frank Rich points out in a marvelous piece titled “Stag Party”: <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">“For much of its history, misogyny was not the style of the party of Lincoln</a>. For most of the twentieth century, the GOP was ahead of the curve in bestowing women’s rights</p>
<p>Today, many Americans under 40 have no idea how different the GOP (not the mention the country as a whole) was 25 or 30 years ago.</p>
<p>Rich takes us back, reminding us that Republican presidential candidate Barry Goldwater (who in 1964 was considered ultra-conservative) was married to a woman who had been “inspired by birth control pioneer Margaret Sanger.” Thus, Peggy Goldwater “would help build one of the nation’s largest Planned Parenthood affiliates.”</p>
<p><a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">Barry Goldwater favored abortion rights</a>. “‘I think the average woman feels, My God, that’s my business,’ and that’s the way we should keep it,” he said late in his career.<br />Rich goes on to reveal that “Prescott Bush, the Connecticut senator who sired a presidential dynasty, was another Sanger enthusiast and treasurer for the first national Planned Parenthood fund-raising campaign. His son, <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">George when a congressman in the sixties, was an ardent birth-control advocate and the principal Republican author of the trailblazing Family Planning Act of 1970. </a>”</p>
<p>“Capitol Hill colleagues jokingly nicknamed him ‘Rubbers.’”</p>
<p>Even Richard Nixon, that much misunderstood liberal Republican, favored the Equal Rights Amendment and in 1972 signed the Equal Employment Opportunity Act to strengthen the policing of workplace discrimination.”</p>
<p>But Nixon was nothing if not a study in anguished contradictions<a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">. “At the tail end of the Nixon presidency,” Rich notes, “the GOP started backing away from its traditional beneficence on women’s issues</a>.” In a telling shift, “Nixon vetoed a bipartisan bill enabling child care for the millions of mothers then rapidly joining the workforce.”</p>
<p>Looking back, the timing makes sense. Both Watergate and Nixon’s “enemies’ list” foreshadowed the deepening parenoia that would lead to a purge with the Republican party itself.<br />Granted, it would be two decades before the GOP’s “Big Tent” collapsed. The liberal and moderate Republicans who I had admired in the 1970s and 1980s (Nelson Rockefeller, Lowell Weicker, and Charles Mathias, to name a few) would disappear. But it was not until the 1990 that the long knives came out, and moderates began to be sliced out of the party. Some gave up and retired.</p>
<p>Why did Nixon kill the childcare bill? Rich explains: “His veto was accompanied by a jarring statement that child care would threaten American families by encouraging women to work,” <a href="http://www.healthbeatblog.com/2012/08/as-the-republicans-take-tampa-consider-what-a-gop-victory-would-mean-for-womens-health/.http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/gop-women-problem-2012-4/">The inspiration for this unexpected reactionary broadside came . . . from political strategists eager to exploit the growing backlash against the sixties feminist movement.”</a></p>
<p><strong>Backlash–As Male “Influence and Power” Declines </strong><br /><strong><br /></strong>What we are seeing in the GOP today is a continuation of the pay-back that Susan Faludi described in her 1991 book, <em>Backlash</em><strong><em>.</em> </strong><br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong>Conservatives like to claim that “The War Against Women” is a metaphor manufactured by Democrats as they prepared for the 2012 election. This simply is not true. Long ago, women such as Faludi saw that herd of elephants coming our way.</p>
<p>In fact, as Rich points out, in 1996 “Tanya Melich, the daughter of a state senator in ultraconservative Utah” who grew up “to be a stalwart New York Republican and a 1992 Bush convention delegate, wrote a book titled <em>The Republican War Against Women</em>. “These days,” he writes, “her eyewitness account of her party’s transformation seems more pertinent and prescient than ever.”</p>
<p>The anger that Republicans direct toward women that can be traced to the “women’s movement” of the 1960s. Men feared that women would take their jobs. Husbands were threatened; once their wives had some financial independence, they might decide to strike out on their own. Fathers realized that the “Pill” would give their daughters sexual freedom: marriage could become a choice, not a necessity.</p>
<p>Worst of all, as women gained power, both in the workplace and in government, this could mean that men would find themselves having to answer to the likes of Elizabeth Warren. (In 2009, when Warren, who is now running to recapture Ted Kennedy’s Senate seat for the Democrats, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pz7ruJw6byQ">questioned Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner about 13 billion dollars Goldman Sachs got out the back door of AIG –“Do you know where the money went?”</a> — her tough, probing questions made jaws drop– including Geithner’s. Geithner would later express opposition to her possible nomination to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.)</p>
<p>In <em>Backlash</em>, Faludi quotes Seymour Martin Lipset and Earl Raab, two political scientists who have explored the “politics of backlash”: “The reaction” is driven by “groups which are declining in a felt sense of importance, influence and power,” they explain, “Unlike classic conservatives” Faludi adds, “these ‘pseudo conservatives,’ as Theodore Adorno dubbed them…are not so much defending a prevailing order as resurrecting an outmoded or imagined one.”</p>
<p>She also quotes the historian Richard Hofstadter: “‘America has largely been taken away from them and their kind, though they are determined to try to repossess it and to prevent the final destructive act of subversion.’”</p>
<p>In other words, they are afraid, and when people are “on the run,” some turn mean.<br />Conservative white men know that the demographics are against them. Before long, they will be outnumbered, and in future years, more and more African Americans, Latinos, Asians and women of all races will be in positions of power.</p>
<p>Let me be clear: I am not talking about majority of white men. My husband, his brother, my son, his father (my ex-husband), and a great many men who I know either personally or professionally do not fit this mold.<br />But, without question, some white conservative men saw Barack Obama’s election in 2008 as a sign that the country “was being taken away from them.” To Mitch McConnell, Obama’s re-election would constitute what Hofstadter terms “the final destructive act of subversion.”</p>
<p>In a sense, those who feared the rise of feminism in the 1960s were right. The women’s movement would never be snuffed out. Instead, it became part of our culture. Today many fewer women call themselves “feminists.” The vast majority of younger women simply assume that they have a right to work, to assume positions of power in the larger world, to control what happens to their bodies. This is the legacy of the Sixties.<br />
<h4><strong>The Violence against Women Act </strong></h4>
<p>Women also take it for granted that they have a right to protection against the rage that sometimes threatens them–and their children– in their own homes.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this year, House Republicans felt free to block renewal and expansion of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), a 20 -year-old law that offers shelter and counseling to women who have been beaten or sexually assaulted by spouses or partners.</p>
<p>In the past, renewal was not even in question. But today, “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/27/us/politics/senate-votes-to-renew-violence-against-women-act.html">Some conservative groups view the Violence Against Women Act as “a slush fund for feminist causes that harms men unfairly and encourages the dissolution of marriages</a>,” the <em>New York Times</em> reported .</p>
<p>Last week, I wrote about <a href="http://www.healthinsurance.org/blog/2012/08/26/what-would-a-gop-victory-mean-for-womens-health/">how and why Republicans were able to block the VAWA on HealthInsurance.Org</a>. Conseratives claim that Democrats “politicized” the issue by turning it into a fight over illegal immigrants, Gays and Lesbians. I do not buy that argument. Nor did all seven Republican women in the Senate. They voted to renew the bill.</p>
<p>That post also explains why it is so important that, in November, women–and men who like women–come out to vote. The turnout, not just in the Presidential contest, but in many Congressional races, will determine who takes over Washington.</p>

<p>Payroll Employment by Presidential Administrations</p>
<p>Ryan is saying that Obama&#8217;s record is like Jimmy Carter&#8217;s record.</p>
<p>When it comes to employment we should hope so.</p>
<p>During Carter&#8217;s four years in office payroll employment expanded some 10 million,<br />or 12.5%.  or at an average annual rate of 3.1%   This is the second best employment record of<br />any post WW II Presidential administration.  It is almost a full percentage point stronger than<br />Reagan&#8217;s average gain of 2.2%.</p>

<p>I would think the better comparison would be against Bush  where over eight years payroll employment only expanded some 308,000.   Interestingly, in three and a half years under Obama payroll employment  has expanded more that it did over eight years under Bush.</p>

<p>You would think that someone in the press would call the Republicans on their claims.</p>
<p>In modern times every Democratic presidential administration left office with a lower unemployment rate than when they took office.  But only one Republican Administration has managed this accomplishment.</p>
