<blockquote><p>After the Akin brouhaha, Paul Ryan was asked his opinion on rape and abortion. He said that “the method of conception doesn’t change the definition of life.”</p>

<blockquote>So rape is just, you know, another way to conceive. There’s consensual sex, sex out of wedlock, and then there’s forcing a woman to do something against her will (rape), traumatizing her for life. All are equal, all are simply “methods of conception” and if a woman gets pregnant by any “method,” men like these, lawmakers like these, will tell her what she can do or can’t do with her own body. </p></blockquote>

What, are we tired of stupid remarks about rape now, so Ryan gets a free pass?” he asks. </p></blockquote>

                                <p>A book review by Dale Coberly </p>
<p><strong>ONE NATION UNDER AARP  </strong><strong>The Fight Over Medicare, Social Security, and America’s Future</strong><br />by Frederick R. Lynch</p>
<p>I was asked to write a review of this book, perhaps because I sometimes write about Social Security. But I had to completely rearrange my perspective in order to even understand what the book is about. I believe that I know that the “Social Security crisis” is essentially a lie. Lynch assumes that the crisis is real and writes about AARP’s efforts to make itself the spokesperson for the Boomers in the “generational war” that will follow from this “fact.”</p>
<p>Given that politics has nothing to do with facts, Lynch and AARP may be on the right track.<br />Lynch introduces his book by describing a conference hosted by AARP&#8230; “to demonstrate to&#8230;boomers that AARP&#8230; is no longer their parents’ AARP&#8230; A rebranded AARP is actively recruiting seventy eight million graying baby boomers. The mating dance of these organizational and generational giants has enormous implications for the nations’ political future. &#8230; half of the voters in the 2008 and 2010 elections were over fifty&#8230; and half of them were members of AARP&#8230; the nation’s fourth highest spending lobby&#8230;”</p>
<p>Okay, that’s why. But then Lynch just assumes “&#8230;an epic fight over&#8230;Medicare and Social Security is being forced by the ballooning national debt.”</p>
<p>In fact Social Security has nothing to do with the “ballooning national debt.” And Medicare so far has had nothing to do with that debt and need not do so in the future. The ballooning national debt has been caused by tax cuts, military spending, and a deep recession caused by unregulated banks “too big to fail” indulging in reckless if not criminal activity.</p>
<p>Social Security is paid for by the workers who will get the benefits. Medicare can and should be organized so workers pay directly and transparently for their own health insurance. The huge cost increases predicted for Medicare are driven by the huge cost increases predicted for medical care. Only a fool would decide that if we are expecting huge medical costs we need to cut our insurance. Even if we can&#8217;t control costs&#8230; and we can&#8230; we are still going to have to pay for them. The easiest way is to pay a little at a time each month while we are young and working. It doesn&#8217;t make much sense to &#8220;save&#8221; the cost of insurance now and be faced with unpayable costs when you are old and no longer working. Only Medicare allows people to pay in advance this way AND to finesse the problem of &#8220;medical inflation&#8221; with pay-as-you-go financing. But &#8220;only a fool&#8221; is what we have in Washington these days.</p>
<p>But IF Social Security is being blamed for the deficit, however falsely, THEN boomers will need leaders to defend it. The most likely candidate is AARP.</p>
<p>Lynch says his book examines three key issues:<br />1.) Are the boomers a sleeping political giant? Can they be organized to determine the policy that will shape the future of Social Security?<br />2.) Is AARP going to lead the boomers&#8230; or “stimulate boomers’ age awareness to entice them into becoming members and purchasing AARP products and services&#8230;?”<br />3) Will boomers and AARP “negotiate an increasingly competitive global super-capitalism&#8230; in which “working class Americans feel threatened” but “the nation’s elite &#8212; highly educated professional and managerial classes &#8212; embrace the new Post American Order?&#8221;</p>
<p>I may be the wrong person to be reviewing this book because I cannot get past the premise. Lynch ASSUMES “generational war,” ASSUMES that “Younger Americans will be asked to subsidize aging baby boomers’ entitlements.”</p>
<p>And this is simply not true. The boomers will have already paid for their Social Security and Medicare. “Younger workers” will be asked to pay, in advance, for their own Social Security and Medicare. That’s how insurance works. It is only the success of the Big LIe that has convinced them&#8230; and the Washington “elite”&#8230; that “pay as you go” means you are paying for someone else’s greedy grannies.<br />Apparently these people think that when you “invest” in a stock, or just put your money in the bank, it lies there breeding interest like bugs in a drawer. The fact is that ALL “saved” money has to be used&#8230; spent&#8230; by someone else to earn interest. What is important is that you get the money back when you need it. Social Security provides the best guarantee in the world that you will get your money back&#8230; and more, if you need it. That’s what makes it insurance.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that even the Big Liars are always promising that “if you are over fifty five, your Social Security will not be affected.” That pretty much eliminates “paying for the boomers.&#8221; It is the “young people’s” Social Security that they are trying to kill.</p>
<p>Perhaps the boomers, and the young people who may someday grow old in spite of themselves, will need AARP to represent them. But it is by no means clear that AARP understands Social Security or cares about the interests of old people. Instead, perhaps, it just wants a seat at the table, the power that that represents, and of course the business that comes their way as a result of being seen as the retirees representative in Washington.</p>
<p>I don’t know. </p>
<p>But if Lynch is right and AARP is the best hope we have in the game the “elite” are playing with our retirement security, then others more attuned to real politics than I am may want to start by reading his book.<br />And maybe they can see if there is a way to influence AARP’s influence on the phony “generational war.”</p>
<p>They would have this much going for them: Lynch quotes AARP CEO Bill Novelli,</p>
<blockquote><p>“But when you get down to the level of needs, everyone needs health and healthcare and they need long-term financial security. Then, when you get down to the level of values, all generations are the same: they want a better world for their children and grandchildren; they want to leave the world a better place and to leave a legacy.

<p>And what they would have going against them is that unfortunately these values are not shared by the “elite” leaders of both parties and their sponsors, who want only what’s in it for them, here and now. And know how to lie to get it.</p>

                                <h3>The Federal Bailout That Saved Bain Capital &#038; Mitt Romney</h3>
<blockquote><p>Government documents prove the candidate&#8217;s mythology is just that</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>by: <strong>Tim Dickinson</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><strong></strong>Mitt Romney likes to say he won&#8217;t &#8220;apologize&#8221; for his success in business. But what he never says is &#8220;thank you&#8221; – to the American people – for the federal bailout of Bain &#038; Company that made so much of his outsize wealth possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>In fact, government documents on the bailout obtained by <em>Rolling Stone</em> show that the legend crafted by Romney is basically a lie. The federal records, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, reveal that Romney&#8217;s initial rescue attempt at Bain &#038; Company was actually a disaster – leaving the firm so financially strapped that it had &#8220;no value as a going concern.&#8221; Even worse, the federal bailout ultimately engineered by Romney screwed the FDIC – the bank insurance system backed by taxpayers – out of at least $10 million. And in an added insult, Romney rewarded top executives at Bain with hefty bonuses at the very moment that he was demanding his handout from the feds.<br />…<br />Under normal circumstances, such ample reserves would have made liquidating Bain an attractive option: Creditors could simply divvy up the stockpiled cash and be done with the troubled firm.<br />…<br />What&#8217;s more, the bonus loophole gave Romney a perverse form of leverage: If the banks and the FDIC didn&#8217;t give in to his demands and forgive much of Bain&#8217;s debts, Romney would raid the firm&#8217;s coffers, pushing it into the very bankruptcy that the loan agreement had been intended to avert. The losers in this game would not only be Bain&#8217;s creditors – including the federal government – but the firm&#8217;s nearly 1,000 employees worldwide.<br />…<br />The FDIC considered finding a buyer to take over its loans to Bain, but analysts concluded that &#8220;Bain has no value as a going concern.&#8221; And the government wasn&#8217;t likely to get much out of Bain if it allowed the firm to go bankrupt:<br />…<br />How had Romney scored such a favorable deal at the FDIC&#8217;s expense? It didn&#8217;t hurt that he had close ties to the agency – the kind of &#8220;crony capitalism&#8221; he now decries. A month before he closed the 1991 loan agreement, Romney promoted a former FDIC bank examiner to become a senior executive at Bain. He also had pull at the top: FDIC chairman Bill Seidman, who had served as finance chair for Romney&#8217;s father when he ran for president in 1968.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The federal documents also reveal that, contrary to Romney&#8217;s claim that he returned full time to Bain Capital in 1992, he remained involved in bailout negotiations to the very end….</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The platform the party adopted yesterday at its national convention in Tampa, Florida, calls for a commission to investigate a possible “metallic basis for U.S. currency.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The move is driven by supporters of Representative Ron Paul of Texas, the libertarian presidential candidate who has long criticized the Fed’s control of the money supply and wants to revive the gold-dollar link to preserve the currency’s value.<br />….<br />I’m not particularly worried,” said economist John Makin of the American Enterprise Institute in Washington. “It’s not as if we’re about to rocket higher<br />…..<br />Such vigilance on inflation could affect the Fed if Romney wins in November. The former private equity executive has vowed to replace Bernanke, whose term expires in 2014. He’d likely fill any unexpected vacancies on the Fed board with inflation hardliners, who might favor raising interest rates before the end of 2014, as Fed policy makers currently plan, says Mark Thoma, an economics professor at the University of Oregon.<br />“If Romney is elected, he will put people on the board of governors who are very credibly hawkish,” Thoma said.<br />…<br />Romney’s running mate, Representative Paul Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman, called in March 2009 for the Fed to base the dollar’s value on market measures “such as a basket of commodities.” Ryan also has assailed the Fed’s asset purchases.<br />“There is nothing more insidious that a government can do to its countrymen than to debase its currency,” he said in December 2010.<br />…<br />Critics such as Meltzer worry that the Fed will wait too long to begin withdrawing its extraordinary financial support.“We have a long history of producing money too fast, faster than the growth of the economy, and it always ends up in inflation.” </p></blockquote>

<p> Romryanomics&#8211;prosperity for the well-off fueled by austerity for the rest</p>
<p> I&#8217;ve put off writing about stilted robo-Romney&#8217;s choice of the perpetual-smily-Ryan as veep about as long as I can, I suppose.  So let me talk about it in broad terms in this post.  In the next posts, I&#8217;ll discuss more methodically the vacuous &#8220;Romney program&#8221; and the toxic &#8220;Ryan path to prosperity&#8221; with particular attention to what they have said specifically (or not, in Romney&#8217;s case) about what they want to do with the tax system. </p>
<p>Both Romney and Ryan come from well-to-do families with the privileges of financial support, status and connections that adhere thereto (see <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/20/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-he-didnt-inherit-money-his-parent/">this story</a> on Romney&#8211;by the way, a donated inheritance is still an inheritance and donations of that magnitude earn other privileges for the elite; and <a href="http://blogs.detroitnews.com/politics/2012/08/14/ryans-family-fortune-built-on-taxpayer-money/">this story </a>on Ryan&#8211;whose wife also inherited millions including oil and gas interests), yet support the neoconservative economic mythology that wealth is wholly based on merit and that the way to have a good economy is to make sure the wealthy, who are deemed to be the (mythic) &#8220;job creators&#8221; are happy.  This leads them to support austerity for the middle class and seniors coupled with deregulation, privatization, militarization and tax cuts&#8211;Romryanomics 101. </p>
<p>Key to the Romney program (or what can be derived from a description of generalities-without-specifics that can&#8217;t be scored by economists plus Romney&#8217;s statement earlier that he would sign Ryan&#8217;s budget proposal into law if passed by Congress plus his Monday statement that &#8220;his own plan for Medicare is &#8216;very similar&#8217; to Ryan&#8217;s&#8221;, per this <a href="http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/14/13282003-romney-draws-on-2010-playbook-in-medicare-offensive?lite">NBCnews.com story </a>) and the Ryan so-called &#8220;path to prosperity&#8221; (see, e.g., the <a href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-hiltzik-20120815,0,1949780.column">LA Times story</a>) is privatization of, and spending cuts to, Social Security and Medicare, along with spending cuts to everything else that serves the public good (environmental programs, parks, etc.) and vulnerable minorities in this country and isn&#8217;t part of the military-industrial-financial complex.  That is, social welfare programs that have made the difference between poverty and dignity for American seniors will be undone by some level of privatization and benefit cuts, to accomodate unmerited tax cuts for the wealthy and increased spending on the military (notice the echos of Bush&#8217;s Iraq-war buildup in the talk about being tough on Iran and extraordinarily friendly to Israel coming from the campaign). </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Of course, this program of tax cuts, militarization, and deregulation has already been tried&#8211;those are the ideas that failed to deliver a robust economy under George W. Bush, who had an anemic recovery from 2001-2004 in spite of the $1.3 trillion in tax cuts over ten years enacted in 2001 and the continuing tax cuts carried out in 2003 and 2004.  Nor did Bush&#8217;s imperialistic militarization through two preemptive wars deliver a robust economy.  Instead, the rash of financial speculation and finanialization of the economy pushed us into a deep financial crisis and the Great Recession.  Those ideas will upend the recovery from that recession that has been underway under Obama.</p>
<p>Both Romney and Ryan have personally benefited from the kind of government that recognizes the importance of public-private cooperation in institution and infrastructure building, yet pontificate that government is always less efficient than private enterprise.  That rhetoric is used to justify stifling innovative programs like supporting experiments in environmentally sound energy development, but it doesn&#8217;t come into play as far as continuing to ladle out tax-code largesse to the profitable oil and gas extractive industry or coddling financial institutions through deregulation (Romney, for example, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-14/romney-vowing-dodd-frank-repeal-hits-jpmorgan-inconvenient-truth.html">supports dismantling Dodd-Frank</a>, an already timid effort to rein in financial speculation; Ryan <a href="http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/paul-ryan-really-doesnt-dodd-frank">voted for TARP and against Dodd-Frank</a>, positions that garnered Republicans a haul of financial industry contributions).  That approach will continue the George W. Bush trend of the financialization of the economy and likely land us in another, even worse, systemic financial crisis. </p>
<p>Both had ancestors that benefited greatly (in terms of prestige and in terms of economics) from their involvement in and with government.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_W._Romney">Romney&#8217;s father George</a>, of course, was a well-known governor of Michigan &#8211;and  a wealthy corporate CEO in the auto industry that benefited hugely from the government shift from investment in railroads to investment in roads.  Ryan&#8217;s family reaped its riches at the public trough&#8211;involved in the kind of public-private partnerships that made the transcontinental railroads possible (and built enormous wealth for the railroad builders) and the interstate highway system possible (and built enormous wealth for the highway builders).  See Libby Spencer, Ryan <a href="http://blogs.detroitnews.com/politics/2012/08/14/ryans-family-fortune-built-on-taxpayer-money/">family fortune built on taxpayer money</a>, DetroitNews.com (Aug. 14, 2012);  Sally Kohn, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/08/14/paul_ryan_didnt_build_that/">Paul Ryan didn&#8217;t build that!</a>Salon.com (Aug. 14, 2012) (noting that  the Ryan family, starting with his great-grandfather building railroads, has profited from government contracts over more than a century, including &#8220;at least 22 defense contracts &#8230; since 1996&#8221;).<br />Romney likes to think of himself as a successful businessman who can lead the country by supporting business.</p>
<p>But Romney is mainly a vulture capitalist.  His private equity firm bought companies that were doing well and providing good US jobs, loaded them up with debt so that outsize profits could be made for the Bain &#8220;investors&#8221; (himself included), and &#8211;if it helped them make even more outsize profits&#8211;enjoyed firing the &#8220;excess&#8221; workers. Private equity firms don&#8217;t produce anything.  While the right applauds the so-called &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; that tears existing companies apart to sell off the pieces for more or to enable firing the workers and breaking a union contract, those activities don&#8217;t add to a sustainable economy.  They  mostly look for companies they can take over, with no regard for the workers&#8217; lives or the communities in which the companies exist, in order to capture what economists refer to as &#8220;rent&#8221; profits, usually through loading the companies up with debt.  Some of the companies thrive or just survive, but many of the workers don&#8217;t, since cutting workers is a favored cost-cutting measure.  Some of the companies go bankrupt, leaving all the workers in the lurch and usually without promised pensions.  Some of the companies turn to outsourcing workers in order to make enough to pay off the debt.  There&#8217;s not much in vulture capitalism that bodes well for a vulture capitalist as president.</p>
<p>Ryan likes to think of himself as a principled thinker who will push for what he considers appropriate policies (no matter, apparently, their impact on vulnerable seniors or middle-class Americans).  As Ryan&#8217;s 2005 speech to <a href="http://www.atlassociety.org/outline-john-galts-speech">the Atlas Society</a>made clear, he has been an avid follower of Ayn Rand, the alpha-male praising, privileged-innovator(&#8220;producers&#8221;)-elite loving, anti-societal cooperation, anti-altruism,  radical libertarian, free-trade &#8220;objectivist&#8221; author that has been called the &#8220;Goddess of the Market&#8221; (see Jennifer Burns, Goddess of the Market: Ayn Rand and the American Right).  Ryan even told the Weekly Standard in 2003 that  “I give out ‘<em>Atlas Shrugged’</em> as Christmas presents, and I make all my interns read it,” he said. “Well&#8230; I try to make my interns read it.” Rachel Weiner, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/what-ayn-rand-says-about-paul-ryan/2012/08/13/fd40d574-e56d-11e1-8741-940e3f6dbf48_blog.html">What Ayn Rand says about Paul Ryan</a>, Washington Post (Aug. 13, 2012).  Lately, though, he&#8217;s been trying to distance himself from Rand, perhaps because he finally learned that her brand of radical libertarianism derived from atheism rather than theism.  Kate Sullivan, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/pageviews/2012/08/veep-nominee-paul-ryan-renounces-former-fascination-with-ayn-rand">Veep nominee Paul Ryan renounces former fascination with Ayn Rand</a>, NY Daily News (Aug. 14, 2012).</p>

<blockquote>I don&#8217;t understand why someone with such a clownish views is lauded as a policy wonk:</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/08/13/what-did-ayn-rand-teach-paul-ryan-about-monetary-policy/">What did Ayn Rand teach Paul Ryan about monetary policy?, by Brad Plumer</a>: In 2005, Paul Ryan explained that he often looks to Ayn Rand’s novel “Atlas Shrugged” as inspiration for his views on monetary policy. </p></blockquote>
<p><strong>…</strong></p>
<p>[See Brad DeLong too: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/08/reflections-on-paul-ryans-transactions-in-individual-bank-stocks-in-2008.html">Reflections on Paul Ryan&#8217;s Transactions in Individual Bank Stocks in 2008</a>.]</p>
<p>Romney and Ryan don&#8217;t approve of fiscal policy stimulus (unless it&#8217;s tax cuts for the wealthy), and Ryan would take away the ability of the Fed to respond to unemployment as well. Basically, they are telling us that if a recession hits and they have their way, nothing will be done. Not a thing. No fiscal policy response (except perhaps austerity to make it worse), and no monetary response (except, if Ryan has his way, interest rate increases based upon a <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/zero-bounds-and-butter-mountains-wonkish/">misunderstanding of how the economy works</a> &#8212; that would also make things worse). So it wouldn&#8217;t just be the &#8220;you&#8217;re on your ownership society&#8221; of Randian dreams, Ryan would have monetary and fiscal authorities making things even worse than they already are.</p>
<p>Ryan is not a well-informed policy wonk with new, exciting ideas. He&#8217;s a policy idiot. Don&#8217;t let this guy anywhere near the policy levers.</p></blockquote>

<p> The fallacy of privatization: anti-government screeds and the Romney agenda</p>
<p> As a prominent tax professor points out, Mitt Romney accumulated most of his additional wealth in a business that generally doesn&#8217;t do anything to increase national wealth.<br />
<blockquote>Mitt Romney accumulated his wealth as managing director of Bain Capital, a leveraged buyout fund (LBO).  LBOs are driven by tax savings.  Tax savings are transfers from other people to LOBs without any increase in GDP or national wealth.  An LOB replaces the stock of established companies with debt.  Johnson argues that because interest is deductible, the replacement can increase the value of the surviving stock by two to six times without any improvement in operating income.  The increase in debt harms the private economy because the companies become very fragile and the leverage encourages the owner to bet the company.  Calvin Johnson, <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2125210">The Tax Explanation for the Romney Leveraged Buyouts</a>, Tax Notes (July 30, 2012), at 579</p></blockquote>
<p>Romney&#8217;s activities at Bain Capital are just one example of how the private economy can generate wealth for a few people at the top without doing anything to help the overall economy, GDP, or national wealth&#8211;or ordinary workers.  With that in mind, we should then be rightly skeptical about the typical claims from the right that the private economy can always do a better job of any given task than government (the public economy).  Yet if you asked that as a question of Romney, you&#8217;d get a canned &#8220;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>For Romney, efficiency and competition are gods that only the private marketplace can worship and therefore all government functions would be better handled by private rather than public forces.  That seems to be the gist of his statement in a recent interview, highlighted by Mark Thoma&#8217;s post on <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2012/08/outsourcing-government-what-is-mitt-romney-talking-about.html">Outsourcing Government: What is Mitt Romney Talking About</a>, at Economist&#8217;s View, that builds on Brad Delong&#8217;s post.  Here&#8217;s the most relevant language from Romney on the idea that private is always better than public:<br />
<blockquote>MITT ROMNEY: Well, clearly you don’t like to hear [about] anyone losing a job. At the same time, government is the least productive—the federal government is the least productive of our economic sectors. The most productive is the private sector. The next most productive is the not-for-profit sector, then comes state and local governments, and finally the federal government. And so moving responsibilities from the federal government to the states or to the private sector will increase productivity.</p></blockquote>
<p>But that&#8217;s simply wrong.  It is empirically wrong.  It is theoretically wrong.  And it is wrong-headed policy for America.</p>
<p>Mark Thoma also pointed out Paul Krugman&#8217;s earlier post, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/11/opinion/11krugman.html?_r=1">Outsourcer in Chief</a>, New York Times (Dec. 11, 2006), providing a range of examples where privatization of public functions results in terribly incompetent performance.<br />
<blockquote>[O]utsourcing of the government’s responsibilities — not to panels of supposed wise men, but to private companies with the right connections — has been one of the hallmarks of [George W. Bush&#8217;s] administration. And privatization through outsourcing is one reason the administration has failed on so many fronts.</p></blockquote>
<p>Krugman lists, among others, the Coast Guard&#8217;s overrun for its privatized modernization program; the generalized outsourcing of Iraqi reconstruction to private contractors &#8220;with hardly any oversight,&#8221; with the unsurprising poor results;  and Bush&#8217;s buddy at FEMA&#8217;s outsourcing of disaster evacuations to Landstar Express, which &#8220;didn&#8217;t even know where to get buses&#8221; when Katrina hit.  As Krugman notes, outsourcing is an &#8220;antigovernment ideology&#8221; of today&#8217;s neocons, and it is one that leads to poor results in many cases.<br />
<blockquote>Conservatives look at the virtues of market competition and leap to the conclusion that private ownership, in itself, is some kind of magic elixir. But there’s no reason to assume that a private company hired to perform a public service will do better than people employed directly by the government.  In fact, the private company will almost surely do a worse job if its political connections insulate it from accountability.  Id. (formatting changed)</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, mix privatization = poor performance because of crony capitalism/lack of oversight with the tendency these days of businesses to exploit workers in order to harness all productivity gains they do achieve for the big bosses at the top.</p>
<p>(If you need information on the latter, look at the way workers&#8217; wages have stagnated or plummeted while managers have skyrocketed.  Or just Google Caterpillar to see how it is negotiating with its unions for cuts for ordinary workers&#8217; wages and benefits, when it is nonetheless already making an enormous profit.)</p>
<p>What you get from this naive, jaundiced view of private versus public is a formula for a disastrous economy.  Obama&#8217;s stimulus was somewhat less than it should have been, but it saved the U.S. economy from the worst we might well have expected from Bush&#8217;s disastrous reaganomics policies.  Bush&#8217;s preemptive war costs combined with deregulation and tax cuts for the rich and for corporations resulted in huge deficits and ultimately caused the financial crisis,  necessitating unprecedented borrowing that left an economy spiralling in free fall when Obama took office.</p>
<p>What Romney promises, then, is a return to the winner-take-all, failed economic ideas of the neocon right. </p>
