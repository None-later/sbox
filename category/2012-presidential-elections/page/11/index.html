<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/10/perrys-flat-tax-and-other-bold-reform-ideas-in-context.html">Perry&#8217;s Flat Tax and other &#8220;bold reform&#8221; ideas in context of the richer 1%</a>  </p>
<p>The hard right candidates of the GOP are competing to set forth plans that demonstrate their utter and complete loyalty to the right&#8217;s  &#8220;make the rich richer and make businesses less accountable&#8221; economic program. <br />This program involves the tired and failed policies of Reaganomics, just magnified: 
<ul>
<li><strong>more tax cuts for the wealthy </strong>(zero direct taxation of their primary source of income&#8211;making money off money, and &#8211;to the extent that the incidence of corporate taxes says that corporate taxation should be attributed to shareholders&#8211;reducing those taxes as well); </li>
<li><strong>elimination of earned benefits for the rest of us </strong>(assuring huge revenue shortfalls to the federal government and no dedicated funding of programs, along with dedicated axing of benefits through the &#8216;deficit/debt&#8217; scare tactic); </li>
<li><strong>deregulation of everything to do with business or capital</strong> (gutting EPA, Dodd-Frank, Sarbanes-Oxley, and every other regulatory agency no matter the impact on the economy or on ordinary Americans, thus encouraging a return to  speculative frenzy that allows socialization of losses/privatization of gains); </li>
<li><strong>privatization</strong> wherever possible (Perry&#8217;s plan for privatization of whatever Social Security remains after the afore-mentioned gutting; privatization of schools, firefighters, bridges, highways, etc.); and </li>
<li><strong>continued militarization</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Michael Kingsley noted that the &#8220;economic growth&#8221; rationalization of the various flat tax plans that shift the tax burden to the middle class while granting enormous tax cuts to the wealthy is merely &#8220;hope masquerading as theory.&#8221;   See Kingsley et al,<a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-24/flat-tax-proposals-are-perpetual-fount-of-false-promises-view.html">Flat Tax Proposals are Perpetual Fount of False Promises: View</a>, Bloomberg.com (Oct. 24, 2011) (&#8220;This hope masquerading as a theory has dominated conservative economic thinking for three decades, despite all evidence to the contrary&#8221;).<br />Perry&#8217;s flat tax proposal is right on track with the right&#8217;s apparent goal of enriching the rich and shrinking Social Security and Medicare and other federal government&#8217;s programs for the well-being of its citizens.   He offers the so-called &#8220;Flat Tax&#8221; as an option, part of his &#8220;cut, balance, and grow&#8221; economic &#8216;plan&#8217;.   He says it&#8217;s a &#8220;bold reform.&#8221; Opel, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/us/politics/perry-plan-would-grant-big-tax-break-to-wealthiest.html">Perry Calls His Flat Tax Proposal &#8216;Bold Reform&#8217;,</a> New York Times (Oct. 25, 2011).<br />Perry&#8217;s plan involves devastating federal program cuts including cuts to Social Security and Medicare for current and future recipients, as well as a &#8216;cart before the horse&#8217; constitutional amendment &#8211;a &#8216;balanced budget amendment&#8217; that would, for example, prevent us from borrowing cheaply even if it were to pay for a temporary surge in costs for Veterans&#8217; medical care due to the cohort of soldiers returned from Iraq and Afghanistan.  The proposal entails an unfounded assumption that reducing federal spending from about 24% of GDP today to around 18% of GDP within a decade would be reasonable, given the lingering costs of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars,  expenditures to make up for the drain on our military, the ongoing costs of the financial crisis sparked by deregulation and the &#8216;too big to fail&#8217; phenomenon, etc.   Perry has argued against &#8220;arbitrary cuts&#8221; to defense spending while at the same time calling for enormous tax cuts for the wealthy.<br />Perry says his system is &#8220;fair, simple, and flat&#8221;.  In fact, it is none of the above.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />So perhaps it is time to discuss two questions about Perry&#8217;s tax plan: (1) just what is this &#8220;Flat Tax&#8221;? and (2) what would be the distributional, administrative, government and other impacts of this new system of taxation (option to choose between the current income tax and the &#8216;Flat Tax)?<br />Regarding the nature of the Flat Tax, it is probably helpful to point out what it is not, since most Americans do not understand how it would work.
<ul>
<li>The &#8220;Flat Tax&#8221; is not flat, since it has two rates: it will have an exemption amount of some sort for the poorest taxpayers, just as our income tax provides a standard deduction and personal exemptions (and other provisions, like the Earned Income Tax Credit) to ensure that the poorest Americans do not have to pay the income tax.  </li>
<li>The &#8220;Flat Tax&#8221; does not eliminate all deductions: it will leave deductions for charitable contributions (highly favorable to the rich who are the ones that make the most such contributions) and mortgage interest (also favorable to the rich, who have the most expensive homes and get the full amount of the interest deduction even with a flat tax), and some health and child care expenditures.  </li>
<li>The Flat Tax is not just a &#8220;single rate&#8221; income tax since it is not tax on all types of income:  it will be a tax on wages that are not saved (so for the majority of Americans, a payroll tax or a tax on consumption).  The primary source of income for the rich &#8211;money earned by money&#8211;would not be counted.  </li>
<li>The Flat Tax is not a &#8216;postcard filing&#8217; tax, Perry&#8217;s assertions aside (that &#8220;taxes will be cut on all income groups in America&#8221; and that taxes can be filed on a post-card size form).  The rich will pay much less, some in the middle class may pay less but only after fiddling with both forms, and the rest will not likely pay less.  The form still will require figuring out what counts as income and when it counts and what type of income it is for anybody in the middle class that might be in either one (lots of filler pages behind that &#8220;flat rate&#8221; times &#8220;taxable income&#8221; calculation). </li>
</ul>
<p>Regarding the feasibility of the &#8220;Taxpayer Choice&#8221; system of income taxation and Flat Tax:
<ul>
<li>The system would lower taxes for the rich (and some others), with no benefit for the poor and lower middle class, so neither simple nor distributionally fair.
<ul>
<li>About 50% of American families pay no federal income tax anyway or pay less than the 20% rate of the &#8220;Flat Tax&#8221;.  Those families would have no benefit from the Flat Tax so for half of Americans, no benefit from the option.  But Perry &#8211;who says he is &#8220;dismayed at the injustice&#8221; of Americans who don&#8217;t pay any income tax (but do pay payroll and excise taxes) won&#8217;t achieve his goal of changing the fact that poorer Americans don&#8217;t pay the income tax.  They don&#8217;t under our current system because we have designed the stnadard deduction, personal exemptions and earned income tax credit to provide a minimal standard of living.  They won&#8217;t under Perry&#8217;s system because they can still file under the current system. </li>
<li>The wealthy would pay substantially less under the Flat Tax, since their main source of income&#8211;income from capital&#8211;won&#8217;t be taxed at all.  They&#8217;ll choose the Flat Tax for a substantial tax cut. </li>
<li>Assuming that the system provides an annual choice for taxpayers, it creates a nightmare.  There will be some in the upper middle class  who will have to calculate their taxes both ways and choose the most beneficial.  For some, there may be some tax benefit to the Flat Tax, but their taxes will be that much more complicated and their benefit will be minimal compared to the tax cut received by the wealthy. </li>
<li>If it doesn&#8217;t permit an annual choice, taxpayers may inadvertently find themselves locked into the clearly wrong system for them&#8211;leading to distrust of government, and a sense of lack of fairness in a system that provides a trap for the unaware. </li>
<li>The differential treatment of income  depending on its character under the Flat Tax option (zero taxed income from capital and fully taxed income from wages) will be yet a further impetus to tax evasion  and unfair taxation of workers compared to owners&#8211;i.e., it is both untenable and unfair.  (This was the reason that the 1986 TRA under Reagan eliminated the category distinction.) </li>
<li>Len Burman describes it as &#8220;political pandering at its worst.&#8221;  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-26/perry-offers-tax-cut-choice-to-minimize-harm-of-simple-system.html">Perry Offers Tax-Cut Choice</a>, BusinessWeek (Oct. 26, 2011).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The system will result in huge decreases in revenues.
<ul>
<li>The upper middle class and wealthy will choose the most beneficial tax (zero taxation of capital income, still get the mortgage interest and charitable deductions which are the biggest tax subsidies against their taxable income) </li>
<li>This will result in substantial decrease in tax revenues, leaving the government wither with huge deficits funded by further borrowing, or the necessity of making huge cuts in long-respected government programs like consumer protection, mine safety, worker safety, food safety, environmental protection and basic research funding for the humanities and sciences </li>
<li>The revenue shortfalls will inevitably call for shrinking the parts of government that the right that passes the bill doesn&#8217;t like&#8211;i.e., New Deal social welfare programs, EPA, etc.  It will make it well nigh impossible for the government to uphold its promise to pay for earned benefit programs like Social Security and Medicare. </li>
<li>That impact is an intended result of the revenue shrinkage built into the Flat Tax plans.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The choice of tax systems will require duplicate tax administration as well (adding costs).
<ul>
<li>Advocates of Flat Taxes/ VATS/ FAIR Taxes (national sales taxes) claim that their plans will all be &#8220;simpler&#8221; because of the single rate.  They disregard the facts </li>
<li>All of the complexities of the income tax remain for both the income tax and the Flat Tax&#8211;what is income, what character is the income, when is it income, is an item deductible or not (charitable contributions can really be quid pro quos, etc.). </li>
<li>Having an option means generating an entirely new set of forms, guidance, regulations that underpin the statute, audits, administrative determinations&#8211;essentially a new division of the IRS to cover the new option </li>
<li>Couple that with the right&#8217;s antagonism to the IRS generally and one can expect an underfunded IRS that has trouble enforcing either the income tax or the Flat Tax. </li>
<li>Underfunding of enforcement (exaggerated by the right&#8217;s demonization of government generally and the IRS specifically) will incentivize tax avoidance behavior&#8211;sophisticated, wealthy taxpayers will game the flat tax system in particular by recharacterizing ordinary expenditures as deductible savings or taxable compensation as excludible capital income. </li>
<li>Federal revenues will likely decrease even further because of the enforcement problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The compensatory benefit&#8211;the claim that the Flat Tax (and accompanying deregulation of financial institutions and major corporations through the repeal of Dodd-Frank and Sarbanes-Oxley) will unleash pent up investment and create a burst of economic growth that creates jobs is simply unfounded in fact.
<ul>
<li>We&#8217;ve tried this philosophy for four decades (since Reagan) and it hasn&#8217;t worked&#8211;it is not the wealthy elite who create jobs; it is the consumers, whose demand creates the potential for business expansion, that create jobs.  See, e.g., James Livingston, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/opinion/its-consumer-spending-stupid.html">It&#8217;s Consumer Spending, Stupid</a>, New York Times (Oct. 26, 2011); Steven Strauss, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/steven-strauss/tax-cuts-economic-growth-_b_1031376.html">Actually Tax Cuts Don&#8217;t Seem to Have Much Impact on Economic Growth</a>, Huffington Post (Oct. 25, 2011) (noting that &#8220;ideology is a poor substitute for pragmatic approaches to complicated problems. In fact the evidence that tax rates influence economic growth in any way is equivocal at best. A myriad of other factors are involved. Simply reducing tax rates, and primarily for the wealthy, may hinder &#8212; rather than enhance our economic recovery&#8221;). </li>
<li>And most of the countries held up as models for how wonderful the &#8220;flat tax&#8221; is in boosting their economy do not actually provide solid evidence for that.  Many flat taxes are in fact flat INCOME taxes, not just wage or consumption taxes.  Countries like Hong Kong, which had a flat tax and managed quite well for a while, benefited from the extraordinary circumstance of acting as the intermediary between communist China and the capitalist world&#8211;so that any tax would have raised sufficient revenues on the kinds of deals going through the city-state.  (And, as my colleague Mike McIntyre just reminded me, Hong Kong also benefited from an early real estate bubble like the one that gave this country a spurt of growth that looked like it was connected to the Clinton and Bush tax cuts but was actually connected to rampant speculation with easy money.) </li>
<li>There is no investment need in businesses that can&#8217;t be met currently by the vast resources of unspent cash held domestically (as well as offshore).  Corporations are not cash strapped&#8211;they are hoarding cash because they don&#8217;t have customers for their products. </li>
<li>The &#8220;Econ 101&#8221; Chicago School theory on which the idea of an economic boom from putting more money in the hands of the monied rests is incomplete and just plain wrong. It is based on unrealistic assumptions about human decisionmaking, &#8220;efficiency&#8221; and &#8220;welfare&#8221;.  Under that theory of efficiency, the marginal utility of the dollar is essentially disregarded.  Under that theory of welfare, if the rich gain all the benefits of the economy as they have for the last decade, that&#8217;s an aggregate increase in welfare so all is fine.  Again, this type of economic analysis is just &#8220;hope [for booming economic growth] masquerading as theory.&#8221; </li>
<li>The facts are different.  Empirical studies show decisively that increasing inequality is extraordinarily harmful to economic growth.  When the top 1% are better off and the 99% are suffering, the society suffers.  See The Spirit Level, Wilkinson &#038; Pickett, or the work of Saenz &#038; Piketty on inequality.  See also Benjamin Friedman&#8217;s book on the importance of broad-based economic growth to a sustainable economy. </li>
<li>In fact, the shortfalls in government revenues will lead to cuts to social welfare programs and to government spending on everything from infrastructure to disease control and food safety.  As to Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, Perry himself suggests raising the retirement age, changing age eligibility for Medicaid, and introducing an income factor in determinating eligibility for these earned benefits.  These kinds of changes and governmental program cuts will have a ricocheting bad effect on the entire economy that is likely to throw the economy back into recession.  Indirect impacts including firing of government workers will add to the detrimental impact on the vast majority of Americans in the middle and lower classes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Perry&#8217;s system also gets rid of the Estate tax.  All told, the right&#8217;s slogan here might as well be:  Make the Rich Richer! (no matter who else is hurt).<br />Note that this is all happening in a context where the rich are getting much richer, and everybody else is barely hanging on.  See, e.g., <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/us/politics/top-earners-doubled-share-of-nations-income-cbo-says.html">Pear, Top Earners Doubled Share of Nation&#8217;s Income, Study Finds</a>, New York Times (Oct. 26, 2011).  The article reports on the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=12485">CBO&#8217;s Oct. 25 report </a>that the top 1 percent more than doubled their share of the nation&#8217;s income over the last three decades of the ascendancy of hard right economic ideas.  Their income increased an astounding 275% between 1979 and 2007.  Meanwhile, the bottom 20% had only an 18% gain in all those years&#8211;and in fact their share of the national income dropped from 7% to a measly 5%.  This is because government policies that can counter the upwards redistribution of income from everybody to the rich have been weaker since Reagan&#8211;&#8220;the equalizing effect of federal taxes was smaller&#8221; as the progressive income tax has become less progressive in nature and more federal revenues have been raised by the regressive payroll tax.  See also <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/26/income-inequality_n_1032632.html">One Percenters&#8217; Income Nearly Tripled in Last Three Decades: CBO</a>, Huffington Post (Oct. 26, 2011) (noting that the US ranks alongside Uganda and Rwanda in terms of the gap between rich and poor, and adding that inequality at that level is &#8220;likely holding back the economic recovery&#8221;). The Perry and Cain plans would exacerbate this trend.  If we are almost at plutocracy (rule of the wealthy) now, we will surely be there if any of the hard right tax plans are put into effect.<br />Perry&#8217;s system dramatically changes the corporate income tax to favor multinationals&#8211;20% rate, removal of various deductions, almost tax-free repatriation of foreign earnings, and a territorial tax system.  Incredible breaks for the multinationals who are moving jobs offshore as fast as they can.  The right&#8217;s slogan here might as well be:  Give It Away to the Multinationals! (so they can move everything offshore).<br />Makes one think that Charles Pierce is correct when he says that these Flat Tax (Perry), FairTax (Cain) and VAT (Cain) plans are just an &#8220;unwieldy parade of hackneyed talking points (Kill the Estate Tax and Save the Family Farm!) and tired applause lines (The Job Creators Are Uncertain!).&#8221;  See Ken Houghton&#8217;s link on Angry Bear, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/rick-perrys-20-20-vision.html?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FHzoh+%28Angry+Bear%29">here</a>.  I only wish I were as certain about the chances of the right&#8217;s not being successful at enacting some form of flat/&#8221;fair&#8221;/VAT tax as Pierce is.<br /><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/">http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/</a></p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/10/perrys-flat-tax-proposal.html">Perry&#8217;s Flat Tax Proposal</a></p>
<p>The Atlantic has a good summary article contrasting Perry&#8217;s Flat Tax proposal (an alternative choice to the income tax, that is modeled after Steve Forbe&#8217;s flat tax, which will result in much lower taxes for the wealthy because of the deductions it retains along with the zero taxation of capital income) and Cain&#8217;s 9-9-9 intermediary proposal as well as Cain&#8217;s ultimate goal of the so-called &#8220;FAIR tax&#8221; &#8211;a national sales tax at a tax-inclusive rate of 23%&#8211;both of which will result in much lower taes for the wealthy because of zero taxation of capital income.  Of course, along the way to his purported &#8220;FairTax&#8221;, Cain will put us through his wacky 9-9-9 plan that includes a VAT (but one that has solely a wage base), an individual Flat Tax (but one whose provisions to benefit the poor are uncertain&#8211;some kind of poverty exemption and impoverished district exemption, without much information about how it works or how much it helps), and a FairTax (without any relief from the lumpiness of the tax that causes it to be particularly unfair to the poorest of the poor).  See Derek Thompson, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/10/perry-tax-flat-tax-fair-tax-vat-tax-whats-the-difference/247333/">Perry Tax, Flat Tax, Fair Tax, VAT (Tax): What&#8217;s the Difference?, </a>The Atlantic (Oct. 25, 2011).</p>
<p><strong>None of these proposals are revenue neutral </strong>(they will raise less revenues than raised under the current tax system).  Either the rates would have to be increased or the government would be forced to operate in deficits (as it was pushed into doing with the Bush tax cuts where the $1.2 trillion cost over ten years of the 2001 bill moved the nation from surplus to deficit in one fell swoop).</p>
<p><strong>None of them are distributionally fair</strong>&#8211;they shift the tax burden (to whatever extent the federal government is allowed to exist) down to the middle class and maybe the poor, while giving the rich extraordinary tax reductions through complete exemption of their main type of income.</p>
<p><strong>None of these proposals are &#8220;simple&#8221; in any meaningful way</strong>.  <a name="more"></a>  They all require similar tax administrative apparatus to the current system (or, in Perry&#8217;s case, duplicative administration to take care of the choice of Flat or Income tax), involve the same calculations about timing, amount and character of income necessary under the income tax (but now fraught with more potential for abuse through mischaracterization, since one type is entirely tax free), and require the same procedural due process and penalty mechanisms, as well as forms, instructions, guidance and audits that are required under teh current system.  The only sense in which the Flat or FAir tax or VAT is simpler is when you mean by simpler that the wealthy pay less in taxes.</p>
<p>So if we are to judge the proposals by their results, it would seem that these two right-wing contenders for the GOP presidential nod think that two things are immensely important:</p>
<p>1) reducing taxes on the uberrich, and</p>
<p>2) reducing revenues available to the government to fund important programs. </p>
<p>That fits, since the right wants to &#8220;drown&#8221; government (and get rid of the New Deal earned benefit programs of Social Security and Medicare that aren&#8217;t needed by the elite who fund the right) and wants to cut taxes on the rich/big corporations as close to zero as it can get away with.</p>
<p>Let me repeat.  The arguments used to support all of these consumption-type taxes are fundamentally flawed.  <strong>They are not simple</strong>&#8211;they will involve the same hair-splitting on categorization of income as the current income tax, the same forms, timing issues, accounting issues, tax procedures for due process, and tax administration as the income tax.  <strong>They are not fair</strong>&#8211;they push the tax burden off on the middle class (and the poor, especially under some of the variants) and give the wealthy inordinate tax breaks by not taxing at all their most common type of income from capital.  They <strong>will not bolster growth </strong>and result in superb &#8220;trickle down&#8221; effects for the poor&#8211;tax cutting measures simply cannot do this because the theory that says they can is based on flawed assumptions about real life and flawed judgments about what matters.  <strong>They will hurt government programs </strong>that are vitally important to quality of life.  <strong>They will exacerbate the inordinate inequality </strong>already hurting the US society by making the wealthy even wealthier, and push us even further towards outright plutarchy (plutocracy and oligarchy at the same time, where a wealthy and prestigious elite holds all the reins of power). <strong>They will result in the dismantling of the New Deal </strong>from Social Security to Medicare, accompanied by gleeful sounds of delight from the radical right that supports the corporatist state and moans of pain from the vulnerable, the poor, and the elderly who are thrust back into neofeudal serfdom under the corporate masters of the universe.</p>
<p>Michael Kingsley and Francis Wilkerson agree with me on the latter issues.  I just found their Bloomberg opinion piece on flat taxes:  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-10-24/flat-tax-proposals-are-perpetual-fount-of-false-promises-view.html">Flat Tax Proposals are Perpetual Font of False Promises</a>, Bloomberg.com (Oct. 24, 2011).</p>

<p>A very interesting video from <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/10/03/333912/reagan-tax-loopholes-crazy/">Think Progress</a> juxtaposes a speech by Barack Obama with a speech by Reagan.  In it, Reagan says:<br />
<blockquote>We’re going to close the unproductive tax loopholes that allow some of the truly wealthy to avoid paying their fair share. In theory, some of those loopholes were understandable, but in practice they sometimes made it possible for millionaires to pay nothing, while a bus driver was paying ten percent of his salary, and that’s crazy. [&#8230;] Do you think the millionaire ought to pay more in taxes than the bus driver or less?</p></blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s the video.</p>
<p>Its been said that Reagan couldn&#8217;t win the Republican nomination for President today.  Its probably true.</p>

                                <p>If your question—correctly—is &#8220;<a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/10/why-has-obama-been-talking-about-the-the-long-run-deficit-for-the-past-two-years.html">why Axelrod and Plouffe were satisfied</a>,&#8221; then you have to think like people whose vote support came, in some significant numbers, from people who were just entering the workforce in 2008 (and who did not show up in 2010 because, having entered, they found they were unwelcome).</p>
<p>Which means, if you&#8217;re any good at your <em>political</em> job at all, you&#8217;re looking at that graph <em>this way</em>:
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zBMF6ForTx0/To4NV6Sh99I/AAAAAAAAAlw/RKHS7MiZ8aU/s1600/PAYEMS%2BNPPTTL.PNG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zBMF6ForTx0/To4NV6Sh99I/AAAAAAAAAlw/RKHS7MiZ8aU/s320/PAYEMS%2BNPPTTL.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>To see if your &#8220;maybe going to be lifetime supporters&#8221; are getting into the workforce or about to have a very short lifetime.</p>
<p>(Note that I have been very generous—that is, in the Administration&#8217;s favor—with the assumption of a 120K/month &#8220;assimilation rate.&#8221; YMMV, but is unlikely to put that bar lower.)</p>
<p>You know I disagree with BarryO&#8217;s idiotic acceptance of (1)-(7), most especially (2)and (4). I&#8217;ve been using the phrase &#8220;cursive-Z recession&#8221; <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/12/quote-of-decade-if-it-goes-way-i-expect.html">since at least December of 2009</a>; the only person outside of the Administration who expected a &#8220;V-shaped&#8221; employment recovery was Bryan Caplan, and he was only willing to bet $100 on it, with a much longer time frame. The Administration has produced a result where the only way Obama makes it to the November 2012 election as the odds-on favorite—even against the current array of Luddites and doofuses—is if he has Timmeh gutted and flayed very publicly, and then walks through Zuccotti Park with his head on a pike,* and even then I&#8217;m not certain that&#8217;s the way to bet. (In fact, I&#8217;ve bet <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/">Lance Mannion</a> the other way.)</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re talking political calculations, we&#8217;ve been hearing for three years how great Alexrod and Plouffe are at their jobs, mainly because they could beat an old man and The Quitter who wanted to continue the policies of the previous eight years, only moreso. (Oh, and that they weren&#8217;t Mark Penn, which seems to be the motivating factor for Scott &#8220;play the manager, not the player or the ball&#8221; Lemieux.) And for three years, they have gotten their arses handed to them, in large part because they are stupider than the Cheney team, and thought that kicking their base would be &#8220;motivational&#8221; for someone other than Mitch McConnell.</p>
<p>Maybe they can&#8217;t read the above graphic; maybe they&#8217;re thinking of it the same way you drew it. But I&#8217;ll give you odds the voters aren&#8217;t. They&#8217;re thinking more about the graphic in the upper-right corner of your website. You know, this one:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZSDuoxEceuM/To4UcvPRx-I/AAAAAAAAAl4/8miwll0K6_k/s1600/delong.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZSDuoxEceuM/To4UcvPRx-I/AAAAAAAAAl4/8miwll0K6_k/s320/delong.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And they&#8217;ve been hearing &#8220;prosperity is just around the corner&#8221; from that crack political team for so long that, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112346/quotes?qt=qt0341862">as Michael J. Fox&#8217;s character once mouthed Aaron Sorkin&#8217;s words said</a>, &#8220;in the absence of genuine leadership, they&#8217;ll listen to anyone who steps up to the microphone&#8230;.They&#8217;re so thirsty for it they&#8217;ll crawl through the desert toward a mirage, and when they discover there&#8217;s no water, they&#8217;ll drink the sand.&#8221;</p>
<p>Welcome to the Sands of Romney-Rubio-Perry-Christie, Brad. Because the people you talk with read the graph you drew, not the one I&#8217;m showing. And may your G-d have mercy on their souls for it.</p>
<p>*Yes, I mean this literally, and, no, I am not advocating it. As I said on Twitter, describing Tim Geithner as a &#8220;<a href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/geithner-dodges-on-sympathy-for-occupy-wall-st-expresses-shock-at-wall-street-antipathy-to-obama.php">career regulator</a>&#8221; is like describing Willie Sutton as a &#8220;career bank manager.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once again, Republicans intent on obstructing the normal operation of the federal government unless they can extract cuts to programs they don&#8217;t like (in the name of deficit reduction) applied the combination of House recalcitrance and Senate anti-majoritarian filibuster to threaten a government shutdown and siderail needed funding for emergency assistance to ordinary Americans until they could get at least some of their objectives. A compromise that will get money to FEMA and keep the government funded for a spell has been reached.</p>

<p><strong>Jobs as the Measure of Economic Success, and Rick Perry&#8217;s Texas  </strong>
<p>We have had a warped sense of how to measure economic success in this country at least since George W. Bush started talking about the &#8220;ownership&#8221; society.  Of course, we should have guessed that moniker was problematic from the start, since it was &#8216;invented&#8217; by a guy who bragged about representing the &#8216;have-mores&#8217; while the economy was rapidly becoming a bi-polar, class-based society of have-mores and have-nots.</p>
<p>Most of the media looks at the gyrations of the Dow Jones Industrial, the S&#038;P 500 and similar indexes of stock pricess and then says our economy is good (if they&#8217;re up) or bad (if they&#8217;re down).</p>
<p>Folks, that&#8217;s only true for those who own most of the financial assets&#8211;the rich folks at the top of the scale.  It&#8217;s not true for the companies. As Ali Velshi noted in the Daily Show clip on the earlier blog post, companies intrinsic values don&#8217;t change by dropping 5% overnight, gaining 3% overnight and then dropping 4% overnight.  The companies are still plodding along doing what they&#8217;re doing.  What changes is the attitudes of those secondary investors&#8211;more and more of them just quick traders out to arbitrage a temporary price difference who don&#8217;t give a damn about the company&#8217;s fundamentals.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Now, if you happen to own a few shares of a company that tanks, you clearly care about that stock price plunge.  And if your retirement account is large and heavily invested in stocks, then you care as well.  But fact is, the way we really should measure the economy is by how much and what kind of work it offers to ordinary Americans.  What&#8217;s the jobs count?  And what do those jobs pay?</p>
<p>And those numbers are important only relative to other numbers.  You don&#8217;t know whether you have a mice or an elephant in terms of job creation unless you know how much your population has grown alongside the growth of those jobs.  This is why the same record on job creation can be made to look good to the naive hearer  (&#8220;more than 5 million jobs in 8 years&#8221;) or terrible (&#8220;only 3 jobs per 1000 new citizens in 8 years&#8221;), depending on whether the hearer gets information on the number of new job seekers as well as the number of new jobs available for those seekers.</p>
<p>So Rick Perry brags about his Texas record.  I&#8217;ve already posted on the many problems in Texas, some of which Perry is responsible for and most of which he is responsible for not addressing.</p>
<p>What about jobs?  Yes, there is still an oil and gas &#8216;one-note&#8217; economy that creates directly and indirectly new jobs as the oil and gas industry grows (for now).  Many of those jobs are minimum wage and lots of them are not very secure.   But our question is what about the new jobs to new job seekers ratio&#8211;are jobs growing, so that unemployment is going down?  or are jobs growing but not at the same rate that the population is growing?    The fact that the unemployment rate has increased to just below the national average at 8.2% suggests that jobs aren&#8217;t growing as fast as the population and maybe that jobs are even shrinking.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s take on this question.  The staff at ThinkProgress and the Center for American Progress Action Fund produced a report that delved a little deeper into the Texas jobs numbers and concluded: <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/texas-ranks-dead-last-total-job-creation-accounting-labor-force-growth/1313595007">Texas Ranks Dead Last in Total Job Creation, [when] Accounting for Labor Force Growth</a>, Aug. 17, 2011.</p>
<p>Here are a few facts from the report:</p>
<p>1) Between 2008 and 2010, jobs actually <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-16/massachusetts-beats-texas-as-unemployment-rises-less-rankings.html">grew at a faster pace in Massachusetts</a> than in Texas.</p>
<p>2) “Texas has done <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2011/06/13/rick-perry%E2%80%99s-jobs-problem-part-ii/">worse than the rest of the country</a> since the peak of national unemployment in October 2009.”</p>
<p>3) The unemployment rate in Texas has been steadily increasing throughout the recession.</p>
<p>4) While over 126,000 net jobs were created in Texas over the last two and a half years, the labor force expanded by over 437,000, meaning that overall Texas has added unemployed workers at a rate much faster than it has created jobs.</p>
<p>5) if there is a real “miracle” here, it is North Dakota, which has seen over 27,000 new jobs and a labor force expansion of only 3,700, resulting in about 24,000 new jobs for workers who previously had none.</p>
<p>The resulting picture comparing Texas to other states in terms of job creation considering labor force increase or decline is the following (note that Michigan&#8217;s &#8216;top&#8217; rating is due to some job creation but primarily to loss of labor force as people without jobs leave the state;  neither Michigan nor Texas has the &#8216;right stuff&#8217;)</p>

<p><a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/blog/2007/07/16/the-rich-pay-too-little-in-taxes-unless-they-pay-too-much">Stephen Dubner </a>says Mr. Romney does and points to a NYTimes oped written by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/business/yourmoney/15view.html?ex=1342152000&#038;en=26407d2d93c122b8&#038;ei=5090&#038;partner=rssuserland&#038;emc=rss">Greg Mankiw</a> as that position paper:</p>
<blockquote><p>But perhaps the very most interesting thing about the Mankiw piece is the lead: “Do the rich pay their fair share in taxes? This is likely to become a defining question during the presidential campaign.” This is a classic in winking understatement, for Mankiw was not only an advisor to Bush, but is also (as duly noted in the bio on his piece) an advisor to Mitt Romney on Romney’s current campaign. I applaud Mankiw, the Times, and Romney for having the courage to produce what is essentially a position paper on taxation in the pages of the Times. As long as everyone’s cards are on the table, which they are here, I see no harm. But I sure would have liked to see the e-mails back and forth between the Mankiw and the Romney camp as the Times piece was being edited; and it sure will be interesting to see how this trenchant piece of tax commentary plays out in Romney’s campaign. I can just imagine one of his opponents whipping out the Mankiw article a few weeks or months from now and waving it in his face &#8211; “So the rich pay too much tax, huh?”</p></blockquote>
<p>Doesn’t the suggestion that the rich pay too much in taxes imply that the middle class and the working poor pay too little? It does unless one thinks we ought to slash the budgets of things like the Defense Department – which is not going to happen if Mitt Romney has his way. The claim that Mr. Romney was courageous in producing a position paper on taxation is absurd on so many levels. <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2007/07/on-political-advising-ii.html">Greg</a> noted one:<br />
<blockquote>No emails. No phone calls. No smoke signals. I am not an employee of the campaign. I am a Harvard professor, expressing my own views, sometimes publicly, sometimes privately to a candidate for President. After listening to a variety of advisers with various perspectives, Romney decides on his own what positions to take.</p></blockquote>
<p>The other levels on which this statement about Romney’s courage is absurd goes to a couple of critiques of Greg’s “super-compelling” oped both noted by <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2007/07/pgl-and-mark-th.html">Brad DeLong</a>. While I think <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2007/07/principles-of-t.html#more">Mark Thoma</a> had a more compelling discussion of the fairness issue, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/07/fair-taxation.html">my contribution</a>, which Brad was so kind to highlight, goes to the simple arithmetic of the long-run budget constraint that Mr. Romney has yet to address:<br />
<blockquote>And by looking at 2004, he is forgetting that the budget is not exactly in balance. Yes, the General Fund deficit was rather large so current tax obligations do not capture the cost of government as in all those deferred tax bills thanks to the Bush tax “cuts”. But one might try Greg did that the unified deficit is not that large … Greg leaves out the fact that we have a large Social Security surplus, which is the reason why he can argue that the “deficit” is not that large. Implicit in the use of this figure is the proposition that those payroll “contributions” we are making are NOT to become our retirement benefits down the road. As long as we are posing questions for political candidates, let’s pose this one for Mitt Romney (as Greg is one of his advisors): do you intend to slash Social Security benefits in the future as you continue to impose these employment taxes? After all, you want to maintain the Bush tax “cuts” and still have a large defense department.</p></blockquote>
<p>In case Mr. Romney hasn’t seen my question – let me restate it. How will you address the long-run fiscal problem, that is, will you raise income taxes or will you impose that backdoor employment tax increase known as “entitlement reform”, which really means cutting Social Security benefits? Until Mr. Romney answer this question clearly – let’s not pretend he has a serious position paper on taxes.</p>

<p>Some thoughts on the next presidential election.</p>
<p>1.  It seems to be a political truism that only Nixon could go to China.<br />
<br />2.  Once a precedent is set, even taboo activities become OK.  Clinton could go to China because Nixon had already gone.<br />
<br />3.  Obama seems willing to, er, &#8220;fix&#8221; a number of programs that folks on the left hold dear like Social Security and Medicare.<br />
<br />4.  GW was unable to tackle Social Security and Medicare, though he did express the desire to do so.<br />
<br />5.  Under the Nixon-has-gone-to-China precedent, Social Security and Medicare will not be off limits to Obama&#8217;s successors of either party.<br />
<br />6.  If Obama wins in 2012, what other Chinas will he visit?<br /></p>
