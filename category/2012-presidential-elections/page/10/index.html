                                <p>Yves Smith spells out her strong opinion of our dilemma nationally for the elections of 2012. This particular arena of regulating banks and non banks and and accountability also takes on a wider symbolic meaning in this election cycle.  How this plays out in determining national budget spending priorities through the lens of an explosion of money spent on national and state elections makes for a need for voters to pay close attention to actual issues and to gain some knowledge underlying economic understanding&#8230;a complicated task for a potentially interested public.  We in Mass. have another election to follow closely through Elizabeth Warren, who has a different take on the issues.

<blockquote><p>&#8230;So let’s return to the rebranding of Obama. From the <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/64fd5abc-2042-11e1-8462-00144feabdc0.html#ixzz1fqUwRF2A">Financial Times</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Barack Obama outlined a plan to toughen penalties against banks that commit fraud in a speech on Tuesday that hardened his attacks on Republicans for “collective amnesia” in backing policies that caused the financial crisis and economic downturn.</p>
<p>Speaking in Osawatomie, Kansas, Mr Obama summoned the spirit of another president, Teddy Roosevelt, who spoke in the same city a century ago about his “new nationalism” and the need for a fairer system that supported the middle class..</p>
<p>Mr Obama was scathing about the banks’ opposition to new financial regulations, saying they were only feared by “financial institutions whose business model is built on breaking the law, cheating consumers or making risky bets that could damage the entire economy”.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>“I’ll be calling for legislation that makes [anti-fraud] penalties count – so that firms don’t see punishment for breaking the law as just the price of doing business.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The misdirection is blindingly obvious. The claim is that the Administration needs new tools to get tough on banks. No, it has plenty of tools, starting with Sarbanes Oxley. As <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2011/03/a-straightforward-criminal-case-against-wall-street-ceos-and-senior-executives.html">we’ve discussed at length in earlier posts</a>, Sarbox was designed to eliminate the CEO and top brass “know nothing” excuse. And the language for civil and criminal charges is parallel, so a prosecutor could file civil charges, and if successful, could then open up a related criminal case. Sarbox required that top executives (which means at least the CEO and CFO) certify the adequacy of internal controls, and for a big financial firm, that has to include risk controls and position valuation. The fact that the Administration didn’t attempt to go after, for instance, AIG on Sarbox is inexcusable. The “investigation” done by Andrew Ross Sorkin in his Too Big To Fail (Willumstad not having a good handle on the cash bleed, the sudden discovery of a $20 billion hole in the securities lending portfolio, the mysterious “unofficial vault” with billions of dollars of securities in file cabinets) all are proof of an organization with seriously deficient controls.</p>
<p>But more broadly, it’s blindingly obvious this Administration has never had the slightest interest in doing anything more serious than posture. <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2010/03/the-empire-continues-to-strike-back-team-obama-propaganda-campaign-reaches-fever-pitch.html">As we wrote in early 2010</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Recall how we got here. Early in 2009, the banking industry was on the ropes. Both the stock and the credit default swaps markets said that many of the big players were at serious risk of failure. Commentators debated whether to nationalize Citibank, Bank of America, and other large, floundering institutions..</p>

<p>The Numbers Behind Newt&#8217;s Plan to Balance the Budget</p>
<p>Newt Gingrich&#8217;s website provides information on <a href="http://www.newt.org/solutions/jobs-economy">The Gingrich Jobs and Prosperity Plan</a>.  It starts with this:  </p>
<blockquote><p>America only works when Americans are working. Newt has a pro-growth strategy similar to the proven policies used when he was Speaker to balance the budget, pay down the debt, and create jobs. </p></blockquote>
<p>Excellent.  That statement should be enough to get an idea of what the program will look like.  I want to focus on the first piece:  balancing the budget. (You can&#8217;t pay down the debt unless you run a surplus, so balancing the budget also deals with that issue.)</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the surplus / GDP looks like for the years from 1988 to 2004.  The gray bar covers the years from 1995 (the Republican Revolution took office, and Newt Gingrich became speaker in 1995) to 1998 (Gingrich resigned as speaker in November 1998.)</p>
<p>(Incidentally &#8211; the surplus is simply Total Federal Receipts less Total Federal Expenditures, which come from lines 37 and 40 of the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&#038;step=1">National Income and Product Accounts Table 3.2</a>.  GDP comes also comes from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">BEA</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nVPk_K2elno/Ttwok_cI9LI/AAAAAAAAAxw/F18FsfQFySY/s1600/Newt_Figure_1.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nVPk_K2elno/Ttwok_cI9LI/AAAAAAAAAxw/F18FsfQFySY/s320/Newt_Figure_1.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As you can see, the deficit did indeed turn into a surplus when Gingrich was in office.  However, the chart makes it clear the trend began before Newt took office and continued after Newt left office.  In fact, it seems that the deficit started falling in 1993.  The surplus, on the other hand, peaked in the year 2000, fell, and the budget returned to a deficit.  So what defined the years from 1993-2000?  Oh yeah, they were the years Clinton was President.  So Newt is basically saying he would support the policies that produced success in the Clinton years.  </p>
<p>That is wonderful&#8230; those were years of great prosperity.  You have to go back to the JFK &#038; LBJ years to find presidents who oversaw faster growth rates in real GDP.  But let&#8217;s stay focused on the deficit and surplus issue.  In fact, let&#8217;s deconstruct the number into its constituent parts.   Figure 2 shows Total Federal Receipts / GDP and Total Federal Expenditures / GDP.  </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_c3tYqZvztE/Ttwok0P3RZI/AAAAAAAAAx8/dd7clNlTomc/s1600/Newt_Figure_2.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_c3tYqZvztE/Ttwok0P3RZI/AAAAAAAAAx8/dd7clNlTomc/s320/Newt_Figure_2.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>As is evident from Figure 2, Total Federal Receipts / GDP hit a low point in 1992 and started to rise in 1993, eventually peaking in the year 2000 and then falling.  Total Federal Expenditures / GDP hit a high point in 1992, then began falling in 1993, eventually hitting a local nadir in 2000 and then starting to rise again.  The trend during the Newt Gingrich years looks like the rest of Clinton years&#8230; well, except for a slight slowing in the rate at which expenditures were dropping.  </p>
<p>Now, you might be thinking that Newt&#8217;s comments about deficit reduction speak more to his views on expenditures than on taxes.  After all, few Republicans talk about increasing the tax burden these days and it would take a lot of guts for Newt to break with his party on this one.  But looking once more at the numbers its obvious Newt really does want Americans to pay more.  </p>
<p>Consider&#8230;  in 1995, Gingrich&#8217;s first year as speaker, federal expenditures were 22% of GDP.In 1998, they were 20% of GDP.  But&#8230;  revenues in 1995 were 19.2% of GDP.  That is to say, had revenues remained at the 1995 level, they would have been less than expenditures and the budget would have still been deficit Newt&#8217;s last year in office (and in fact, in 1999 as well).  But Newt takes credit for balancing the budget.  </p>
<p>Thus&#8230;  by necessity he is taking credit for raising the tax burden on the American people.   Granted, there were no hikes in the marginal rate while he was speaker, but the increase in the tax burden came about with increased enforcement and regulation.  This is a  man with political courage!  This is a man who puts doing the right thing above any thoughts of personal gain! </p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;d like to put the tax hikes that Newt seems to be advocating in context.  For this, I&#8217;m going to steal a graph from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Presimetrics-Facts-Presidents-Measure-Issues/dp/B005HKSK8M/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0">Presimetrics</a>, the book I coauthored with Michael Kanell.  In it, we used a slightly different version of the tax burden:  instead of Federal Revenues / GDP, we looked at the percentage of people&#8217;s income that went to taxes.   We looked at the annualized rate of change of this version of the tax burden for each Congressional administration from 1952 to 2008.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what we found:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E20x9DhypGc/TtwollW_ImI/AAAAAAAAAyI/U7x0mQ5Y-HA/s1600/Newt_Figure_3.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-E20x9DhypGc/TtwollW_ImI/AAAAAAAAAyI/U7x0mQ5Y-HA/s320/Newt_Figure_3.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.</p>
<p>As Figure 3 shows, the Republican Revolution (which granted, extended a few years beyond Newt) oversaw the largest (by far!!!) annualized increase in the tax burden of any Congress in several decades!  Because taxes aren&#8217;t that popular with Republicans these days, Newt is downplaying the issue, but he seems to be dogwhistling it for those of with some familiarity with the numbers.  The only alternatives are that he is ignorant of the numbers, or that he is will to obfuscate the facts, but hopefully we can expect more than that from someone running for the highest office in the land.</p>

<blockquote><p>What caused the housing bubble?</p>
<p>This is a different, though related, question from what caused the collapse of the financial sector or why unemployment is sky-high right now. Why did housing value skyrocket and then collapse? More broadly, why did all kinds of consumer debt expand so greatly over the past decade?<br />&#8230;<br />there’s another argument, which looks at the explosion of international lending and the indebtedness of the United States by foreign investors. Normally capital runs from rich countries to poor countries, but something changed where it reversed as capital went rushing to the United States. This exposed the United States to the same kind of risks developing nations usually face. And the new book Lost Decades by Menzie D. Chinn and Jeffry A. Frieden, economists at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and Harvard, is the best book-length treatment of this argument.</p></blockquote>
<p>(italics mine)<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2011/11/solving_america_1.html">Menzie Chin</a> writes about Lost Decades at Econbrowser:</p>
<p>&#8230;Jeffry Frieden and I conclude in our book, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ssc.wisc.edu/~mchinn/lostdecades.html">Lost Decades</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>America’s prosperity requires fiscal responsibility. The phrase “fiscal responsibility” has been used so much that it is something between an obligatory buzzword and a code word for cutting government spending. In our view, true fiscal responsibility involves a willingness to raise sufficient tax revenue, over the longer term, to pay for the programs the government implements. Fiscal responsibility should not be equated with a small government, but rather with a commitment to pay for the government services provided. If the nation affirms that enhancing national defense and improving health care for the poor are legitimate goals, fiscal responsibility entails raising the revenue to fund these programs, rather than borrowing for them.</p></blockquote>

I might make a list of naughty and nice sayings for another post.<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Tyler Cowen <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/10/assorted-links-267.html">pointed</a> to <a href="http://www.city-journal.org/2011/21_4_meritocracy.html">an article</a> by business-school professor Luigi Zingales about meritocracy. I’d expect a b-school prof to support the idea of meritocracy, and Zingales does not disappoint.</p>
<p>But he says a bunch of other things that to me represent a confused conflation of ideas. Here’s Zingales:</p>
<blockquote><p>America became known as a land of opportunity—a place whose capitalist system benefited <em>the hardworking and the virtuous</em> [emphasis added]. In a word, it was a meritocracy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That’s interesting—and revealing. Here’s what I get when I look up “meritocracy” in the <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meritocracy">dictionary</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>1 : a system in which the talented are chosen and moved ahead on the basis of their achievement     <br />2 : leadership selected on the basis of intellectual criteria</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nothing here about “hardworking” or “virtuous.” In a meritocracy, you can be as hardworking as John Kruk or as virtuous as Kobe Bryant and you’ll still get ahead—if you have the talent and achievement. Throwing in “hardworking” and “virtuous” seems to me to an attempt (unconscious, I expect) to retroactively assign <em>moral</em> standing to the winners in an economic race.    <br />Later, Zingales writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The fundamental role of an economic system, even an extremely primitive one, is to assign responsibility and reward.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a> </p></blockquote>
<p>Huh? Again he seems to be conflating economics with morality, in a similar way as when economists Mankiw and Weinzierl implied that the state only has a right to tax things that are “unjustly wrestled from someone else.” Zingales in the above quote is taking the economic functions of prices, wages, supply, and demand and transmuting them into to the morally-loaded terms “responsibility” and “reward.”</p>
<p>Finally, in his praise of meritocracy, Zingales doesn’t seem to be aware of the concept’s self-contradicting nature. As James “Effect” Flynn has <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2007/12/meritocracy_won/">pointed out</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p>The case against meritocracy can be put psychologically: (a) The abolition of materialist-elitist values is a prerequisite for the abolition of inequality and privilege; (b) the persistence of materialist-elitist values is a prerequisite for class stratification based on wealth and status; (c) therefore, a class-stratified meritocracy is impossible.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To put it another way, Zingales talks a lot about the threat to meritocracy from business capturing government regulation or from pitchfork-wielding hordes raising the marginal tax rate, but he doesn’t consider some much more direct effects of meritocracy such as <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2011/06/how_to_party_yo/">this</a>.</p>

<p>Herman Cain and the Defense of Marriage</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t my usual beat, but I was fascinated to read <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57332384-503544/woman-claims-13-year-affair-with-herman-cain/">this statement</a> by Herman Cain&#8217;s attorney:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rather, this appears to be an accusation of private, alleged consensual conduct between adults &#8211; a subject matter which is not a proper subject of inquiry by the media or the public. No individual, whether a private citizen, a candidate for public office or a public official, should be questioned about his or her private sexual life. The public&#8217;s right to know and the media&#8217;s right to report has boundaries and most certainly those boundaries end outside of one&#8217;s bedroom door.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is an odd position given that Cain <a href="http://theweek.com/article/index/220679/herman-cains-lastest-flip-flop-a-federal-gay-marriage-ban">supports a ban on gay marriage</a>.  After all, supporters of gay marriage have long argued that what two consenting adults do in their bedroom should be nobody else&#8217;s business.  I wonder if Cain or his supporters will change their position on gay marriage.</p>

                                <p>NYT Robert Reich calls our attention to post election 2012 life and political realities:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.robertreich.org/">Looking Beyond Election Day</a>
<p>By Robert Reich, Robert Reich&#8217;s Blog</p>
<blockquote><p>Most political analysis of America’s awful economy focuses on whether it will doom President Obama’s reelection or cause Congress to turn toward one party or the other. These are important questions, but we should really be looking at the deeper problems with which whoever wins in 2012 will have to deal.
</p>
<p>Not to depress you, but our economic troubles are likely to continue for many years &#8211; a decade or more. At the current rate of job growth (averaging 90,000 new jobs per month over the last six months), 14 million Americans will remain permanently unemployed. The consensus estimate is that <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/rate-job-growth-unemployment-rate-stay-disastrously/">at least 90,000 new jobs are needed just to keep up with the growth of the labor force</a>. Even if we get back to a normal rate of 200,000 new jobs per month, unemployment will stay high for at least ten years. Years of high unemployment will likely result in a vicious cycle, as relatively lower spending by the middle-class further slows job growth.</p>

<p>In response to <a target="_blank" href="http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/19/from-gingrich-an-unconventional-view-of-education/?hp">Newt Gingrich&#8217;s</a> comments on failing schools, work, and rising bootstraps, </p>
<p>Peter Dorman at Econospeak replies in: <a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2011/11/education-with-twistan-oliver%20twist.html?"><i>Education with a Twist—An Oliver Twist&#8221;</i></a>  </p>
<p><i>&#8220;why take it out on the janitors? If the school was failing it wasn’t their fault. According to Gingrich, it’s the teachers who can’t make the grade. So why not put the kids to work following lesson plans, going over last year’s standardized tests, etc.? There would be as much pride in this as in cleaning toilets.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Usually when we focus on schools, the focus is on the failing city school model, teachers, and then the students themselves. One commenter draws the following conclusion: </p>
<p><i>&#8220;I spent weekend pass time as an English conversation resource person at a high school in Taejon. I was able to have a first-hand look at how education was done in what was at that time a very poor country with big ambitions. Most villages at that time were without running water or electricity and people still wore the traditional clothing, both men and women. There was no doubt that we were in a foreign country.   <br />Because there was not enough money to provide free public education to everyone, students had to pass examinations starting with what we would call middle school if they were to be allowed to continue. Same for high school and, of course, post-secondary education. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Those who could not pass the tests were not accepted. But some children of families with enough money were able to continue their education through private schools. The system was exactly opposite what I had seen in America where private schools were generally the place where many of the most accomplished students were sent.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>and another:</p>
<p><i>&#8220;The idea seems to be to give the kids some kind of work other than school work; and to build up a work ethic, which could well be more valuable to them than academics if they are in such a dire situation. I know that a friend of mine who runs a small business says he finds it very hard to hire for low end jobs: too many of his new employees don&#8217;t really &#8220;get&#8221; the whole work concept</i></p>
<p><i>I expect anybody who comments here is probably at least middle class. The work ethic is something our parents drilled into us by example and through discipline. That&#8217;s unfortunately not true for a lot of the poor, and it is one reason they have so much trouble improving their lot.&#8221;</i></p>
<p>Is it really the student&#8217;s fault or have we just taken our own fifties, sixties, and seventies values and applied them to a dysfunctional economy and educational system believing there is still a ray of hope if one works hard enough they can still pull themselves up by their boot straps?</p>
<p>Maybe it is true that Korea has been able to lift the boat of equality for all of it students; but then too when all are at the same level of, efforts to lift the outcome are equally divided and not skewed toward the suburbs over the inner cities. Review the difference in tax revenues for Detroit as compared to Rochester Hills, Farmington Hills, etc. if you wish to see inequality. One way to fix the problem is for Detroit to annex the suburbs to provide a better tax base. It is no longer a society which provides an equal chance to all people and the chance for upward mobility we used to experience in the sixties, seventies and eighties is long gone. Tom Hertz does a nice study defining upward mobility in a short study: &#8220;Understanding Upward Mobility in America.&#8221;<br />The days when a good work ethic and a high school diploma being the ticket to the middle class have also disappeared. I am sure you would not solely blame the high unemployment percentage rates on those with just a high school education on a lack of work ethic? And what of college with the high costs of student loans to finance college which has certainly contributed to closing the door on many. I suspect the Korean Vet went to college on the GI Bill the same as I and when it paid for tuition. Loyola of Chicago used to be ~$300 a course in the Masters Program. I am sure it is more now. Dr. Elizabeth Warren reviews what has happened to the chances to enter the middle class; &#8220;<i>The Coming Collapse of the Middle Class.&#8221;</i> <br />Why is it we are willing to finance prisons at an average $24,000 per prisoner and keep captive ~1% of the total adult population, heavily skewed towards minorities, with ~50% being nonviolent, and yet we quibble over financing public schools? Is that expenditure for prisoners reaping a better result? Maybe we should teach high school students to be prison guards as it is a growing business both private and public. Another good and not a terribly long read is Dr. James Gillian &#8220;<i>Violence: Reflections on A National Epidemic.</i>&#8221; A lack of chance in upward mobility with this generation and the previous ones will result in other economic consequences. <br />&#8220;Are there No Prisons??? Are there No Union Workhouses???</p>

<p>Think Progress offers a look at relevant parts of the &#8216;jobs bill&#8217;. In the US, the winds of Washington Politics don&#8217;t blow, they suck.
<p>Gerrymandering the Jobs Bill:</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>The piece of the jobs bill Republicans will pass would end a requirement that the government withhold three percent of the cost of projects contracted out to private companies, to assure tax compliance. It’s a rule that Congress adopted during the Bush administration to cut down on tax cheating by government contractors.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>
<p><i></i>
</p>
<p>The proposals would incorporate a permanent repeal of the withholding which today saves $10 billion in lost taxes. To counter the revenue loss the Republicans have a solution (as paid for by Medicaid/SS recipients):</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;all legislation other than permanent tax cuts for wealthy people must be paid for — typically with cuts to federal programs. So Republicans have selected a provision from Obama’s deficit reduction recommendations that would limit Medicaid eligibility for people who also receive Social Security benefits.</i></p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p><i>A concept called Modified Adjusted Gross Income is used to determine Medicaid eligibility. Currently, it only incorporates the taxable portion of Social Security income in that calculation. Under t a new proposal, it would factor in all Social Security benefits. That means some seniors who currently qualify for Medicaid would no longer be eligible. Doing this would save about $14.6 billion over 10 years — more than the cost of repealing the 3 percent withholding compliance measure.&#8221; <a target="_blank" href="http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2011/10/house-gop-undercuts-obama-jobs-attack-on-congressional-gop.php">GOP Lays Trap for Obama on Jobs Bill&#8221;</a></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i></i></p>
<p>Finance the tax cheats and sacrifice Medicaid and SS recipients.</p>
<p>Watching Your Back???</p>
<p>In Order to open negotiations with the Repubs, the Dems on the Super Committee<i> </i></p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;are offering to cut Medicare and Medicaid benefits as part of a roughly $3 trillion grand bargain, which would well exceed the $1.2 trillion minimum goal the committee is tasked with meeting.</i></p>
<p><i>The Democratic plan proposes cutting the deficit by $2.5 trillion to $3 trillion and calls for between $200 billion and $300 billion in new stimulus spending to boost an ailing U.S. economy. It would be paid for with lower interest payments from reducing deficits.</i></p>
<p><i>It also seeks around $400 billion in Medicare savings, with half coming in benefit cuts and the other half in cuts to healthcare providers. Details of that proposal were scant but tackling the popular Medicare program is always politically risky for politicians in Washington, especially Democrats.</i></p>
<p><i>The Democratic proposal also identifies $100 billion in cuts to the Medicaid healthcare program for the poor, according to a lobbyist in contact with the committee.&#8221;</i></p>

</p>
<p>Fortunately, The Repubs would not accept a tax increase on the income rich even with throwing Grandmother under the bus to finance it . . .
<p>The Party of &#8220;No&#8221;rquist</p>
<p>It appears that many of the signers of the pledge representing &#8220;No&#8221;rquist beliefs and the Repub party over the constituency which elected them have feet made of sand as the currents of public anger are over whelming the views proffered.</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;<i>ATR currently has signatures from 238 House representatives, 41 Senators, 13 governors, and all of the GOP presidential candidates except former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman.&#8221;</i></p></blockquote>

</p>
<p>Who elected these turkeys??? Hmmm, that&#8217;s right, we did and the views they are espousing? Even that ever lovable former Senator from that wilderness state west of the Hudson Wyoming is calling for a resistance to outside influence (ATR) which has no impact on getting elected again. And Senator Coburn challenged Norquist on Ethanol subsidies? Such bravado . . .</p>
<p><i></i></p>
<blockquote><p><i>“Have we really reached a point where one person’s demand for ideological purity is paralyzing Congress to the point that even a discussion of tax reform is viewed as breaking a no-tax pledge?</i>” Senator Wolf asked.</p></blockquote>
<p>And the man with the perpetual sun tan Boehner asked of Norquist&#8217;s relevance. </p>
<p><i></i></p>
<blockquote><p><i>&#8220;some random guy, </i></p>
<p><i>Grover told me that he saw himself as the Lenin of the conservative revolution and that Ralph Reed was his Trotsky and Jack Abramoff was his Stalin.”</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p><i> </i></p>
<p>As  Oliver Wight used to say &#8220;Cement heads!&#8221; Someone has sounded the &#8220;abandon ship&#8221;  alert as the Repub-titanic has struck the iceberg of public dissent. Maybe  Occupy America has struck a nerve? It doesn&#8217;t take a weatherman . . . We will  make the same mistake again and re-elect these turkeys.</p>

<p>The right&#8217;s nutty claims about job creation&#8211;Gingrich and the estate tax
<p>The right is busy selling its program for enriching the rich to the working class.  As usual, the sales pitches are full of false and nutty claims pitched to fool hard workers who are uninformed about the facts.</p>
<p>Newt Gingrich, for example, pitched the claim that eliminating the estate tax that applies only to the biggest multimillion dollar estates&#8211;a large tax cut applicable only to the uberrich silver-spoon kids who do nothing to earn the largesse&#8211;will cause all kinds of wondrous economic changes.   See &#8220;To create Jobs, abolish the death tax now&#8221; (The Newt Gingrich Letter).</p>
<p>These claims are based on a  so-called &#8220;study&#8221; by the American Family Business Foundation (put in quotes, since this is a paid &#8220;study&#8221; by  a propaganda tank that asks family businesses of the kind that might have to pay the tax whether they would create more jobs if they didn&#8217;t have to pay the tax, and gets the not at all unsurprising self-serving answer that &#8220;oh yes, we&#8217;d have more jobs with fewer taxes&#8221;.)   So the study and Gingrich make pie-in-the-sky claims that</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<ul>
<li>the US government would actually take in more tax revenues by getting rid of the millionaires &#038; billionaires&#8217; estate tax&#8211;even claiming a specific number of $362 billion more in taxes.  (It helps if the persons answering the self-serving survey give numbers that can be used to make these specific type of claims.) </li>
<li>Gross Domestic Product would increase by 2.26% just by eliminating the tax </li>
<li>New revenues from the &#8220;economic activity that would result from the elimination of the [estate] tax&#8221; would be twice as much as the revenue gained from the current estate tax; </li>
<li>the economic growth from eliminating the estate tax would &#8220;create thousands of new jobs as families kept more small businesses running through mutliple generations and shifted their efforts from avoiding estate taxes to investing in America&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Balderdash</p>
<p>Eliminating the estate tax won&#8217;t create new economic growth, new investment in jobs, save family businesses or divert monies now spent on tax evasion to worthwhile domestic investments.  Most of the claims in articles like Gingrich&#8217;s or in &#8220;studies&#8221; like the self-serving American Family Business Foundation are unfounded, based on absurd assumptions or simply made up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Estate tax reduction or repeal doesn&#8217;t lead to growth</strong>.  We have cut taxes on estates enormously in the last decade and growth has stagnated, with none of the benefits going to the vast middle and lower classes.  There&#8217;s no empirical evidence supporting the self-serving claims that such a tax cut helps growth.  In fact, evidence on inequality in societies supports exactly the opposite conclusion&#8211;the more we allow spendthrift heirs to take over family fortunes tax free and accumulate even more wealth, the worse it is for economic growth and societal wellbeing. </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax reduction or repeal doesn&#8217;t create jobs</strong>.  Money saved from taxes doesn&#8217;t automatically get plowed back into businesses in a way that creates jobs.  It&#8217;s more likely to get plowed into private equity funds (that strip companies of their employees and load them up with debt in order to resell them at great gain for the equity investors and great loss of jobs) or invested in emerging market economies to diversify portfolios.  Most use of excess funds by the wealthy, that is, benefits the wealthy at little or no good to society and in fact often with considerable harm to society in terms of job loss </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax repeal doesn&#8217;t &#8220;save&#8221; family businesses, because they aren&#8217;t at risk from the estate tax in the first place.</strong>  Very Very few (if any) family businesses are lost to the estate tax.  There is a provision in the Code allowing installment payments over 14 years to ensure that family farms can stay in business by paying the estate tax out of annual incomes.  The argument about loss of family businesses is invented to appeal to those who do not understand the very limited number of estates subject to the tax in the first place (fewer than 2%). </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax repeal doesn&#8217;t prevent sales of family businesses upon death of the founder&#8211;and those sales are often a good thing!</strong>  Many times, family businesses are sold upon the death of the founder because nobody in the family wants to run it anymore&#8211;they want to take their cash and go live their own lives.   That&#8217;s probably not a bad result for the economy&#8211;new management will tend to see opportunities that the old business had ignored.  All repeal of the estate tax would do would be to put more money in the hands of heirs who do nothing to deserve it. </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax repeal isn&#8217;t needed to avoid &#8220;double taxation.&#8221;</strong>  Gingrich tries to make the case, quoting Petter Ferrara as follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The [estate] tax taxes yet again a lifetime of savings and investment that has already been taxed multiple times.  It is double taxation on top of double taxation, which often forces loved ones left behind to sell the family farm, ranch or business to pay the taxes just when they are suffering from their loss the most.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not so.  Many estates have as their primary assets investment securities that represent considerable appreciation that has NEVER been taxed.  Elimination of the estate tax means that even this &#8220;last chance&#8221; for getting a single tax bite would be eliminated.  Many of the biggest estates represent passage of stock from one generation to another with almost no taxation along the way.  Whereas workers pay tax on every single dollar earned and have little ability to use their salaries as collateral for big investment plays, wealthy heirs of financial assets can use their assets as collateral for loans to &#8220;monetize&#8221; their wealth without taxation.  Most substantial family farms and ranches are now incorporated, with use of various schemes to zero out corporate income and pay no taxes (especially, e.g., depreciation of equipment and &#8220;salaries&#8221; for family members and corporate ownership of personal residences resulting in widespread ability to deduct personal expenses not possible to ordinary wage workers).  Double taxation is a fabricated myth for most of these estates.  As Leona Helmsley famously stated&#8211;only little people pay taxes.</p>
<p>And of course, as already noted, the sales are usually because they WANT to sell, since family farms have 14 years in which to use the income from the business to pay off any (usually small) estate tax due.  Remember that the effective estate tax rate is usually very very low, given the very large current exemption amount.  Only the estate above the multi-million dollar exemption amount is subject to tax, and the rate right now is inordinately low and there are numerous accepted and simple mechanisms, such as family limited partnerships and other devices, which result in much lower evaluations than fair market value under current warped rules.</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, it is important to note the many beneficial effects of the estate tax:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the estate tax provides revenues to help combat significant budget deficits.  Those deficits have</strong> been substantially created by two problems&#8211;wars being fought without the normal tax increases to fund them, and tax cuts even when those cuts created hundreds of billions of dollars in annual deficits. </li>
<li><strong>the estate tax is a slightly redistributive mechanism to counter the upwards redistribution that is the norm in our current economic system.  </strong>CEOs get golden parachutes for ruining companies, and bankers and managers take all the benefits of worker productivity gains.  Ordinary employees are denied the right to form a union by every employer trick imaginable and by the right&#8217;s unwillingness to let card check become law.  Workers therefore end up scraping by on a combination of devalued wages and debt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping the estate tax, and making it more progressive so that the estates of the uberrich are appropriately taxed under &#8220;ability to pay&#8221; concepts regarding the marginal utility of the dollar, is the fair thing to do. And it would have a stimulative effect on the economy by providing revenues for governmental infrastructure and other projects.  Counter to Gingrich&#8217;s claim, repealing the estate tax would be a further step backward  to the robber barons&#8217; gilded age.  Let&#8217;s not take that step.</p>

<p>the right&#8217;s smoke &#038; mirrors scams about corporate tax &#8220;reform&#8221;
<p>One could get a pretty gloomy picture of the state of Social Security, and the need to &#8220;reduce entitlements&#8221; while at the same time hearing about the (faked) urgency of cutting corporate taxes in order to give our US multinationals an edge in global competition, if you pay much attention to the GOP presidential candidates talk and listen to their echo chambers in the right-dominated GOP factions in the House and Senate and their marketers in the Koch etc. funded propaganda tanks like the misnamed &#8220;Americans for Prosperity&#8221; (should be &#8220;Americans for prosperity for the have-mores&#8221;). </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>These same right-wing politicians and funders were gung-ho for two budget-busting manuveurs under George W. Bush&#8211;outrageous tax cuts of primary benefit to the rich (such as the gradual reduction of the estate tax to its one-year repeal in 2010 and its rebirth in 2011 at an absurdly low rate with an equally absurdly high exemption amount) and outrageous spending for more and more militarization of the US society (wars of choice in Iraq and Afghanistan, where hundreds of thousands have died but little in the way of lasting peace has been gained, and a gigantic &#8220;homeland security&#8221; apparatus that has eroded the civil rights of US citizens, including allowing one to be targeted and assassinated on solely the say-so of the executive branch without any of the due process protections supposedly guaranteed by our pre-Bush constitution).  Cheney of course famously quipped that deficits don&#8217;t matter any more, when he was helping to push the $1.3 trillion 2001 tax cut that would give him and George W. huge tax cuts in the tens of thousands for 2001 alone.  Then there was the 2003 tax cuts aimed especially at relieving the have-mores of taxes on the money their money earned (cutting dividend rates on corporate stock to the same low rates as net capital gains) and the 2004 tax cuts aimed especially at giving multinational corporations the many tax breaks they&#8217;d been lobbying for avidly for the last two decades, along with a &#8220;repatriation holiday&#8221; that allowed the ones who&#8217;d worked most assiduously to avoid paying US taxes on their profits from intangible intellectual property rights to spend the money on outsize managerial compensation and shareholder stock buybacks while firing regular employees with very little or even no tax consequences.</p>
<p>Now, the right wants to repeat all of that.</p>
<p>Dave Camp, minion of multinational corporations, is crafting a give-it-all-away package of so-called corporate tax reform that may cut back on loopholes but in the process will lower rates and allow multinationals to offshore money-making enterprises, with the results that even fewer multinationals will actually pay any federal corporate income taxes. (The text of Camp&#8217;s release about his corporate tax &#8220;reform&#8221; proposal is appended at the end of this posting).  Camp calls for a 25% rate and a territorial tax system that would cut corporate tax revenues even further.  The Joint Tax Committee has noted that cutting all the loopholes in a base-broadening attempt would allow lowering the corporate tax rate only to 28%.  See <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20111102-714429.html">Wall Street Journal report on the JTC report</a>.</p>
<p> All of this is rationalized by the right as necessary to help US multinationals &#8220;compete&#8221; on the global stage. </p>
<p>You&#8217;d think that US corporations were slaving away under incredibly heavy US federal income tax burdens, but there&#8217;s no truth to that at all.  Most of the griping about the corporate tax talks solely about federal statutory rates and not about either the effective tax rates (what corporations actually pay) or about the lack of most of the other kinds of corporate taxes paid by corporations housed in other developed nations (much higher Value-Added Taxes and excise and transfer taxes). </p>
<p> In fact, most US multinational corporations are not heavily taxed at all, and most of the smaller US corporations zero out their profits with shareholder &#8220;salaries&#8221; (deductible) and other often easily manipulated expenses (personal expenses of &#8216;family farmers&#8217; whose homes and cars and everything else are &#8220;owned&#8221; by the family farm corporation, etc.).  Citizens for Tax Justice has for several years looked at publicly reporting US corporations&#8217; fiscal statements on taxes and profits to tell the real story about profitabilty and taxes.  It&#8217;s not the story the Chamber, the National Association of Manufacturers, or the anti-tax, anti-government funded groups or the Koch brothers want known.  But it&#8217;s the facts.  CTJ&#8217;s most recent study makes clear that US multinationals have no trouble competing due to taxes.  See the report: <a href="http://ctj.org/ctjreports/2011/11/corporate_taxpayers_corporate_tax_dodgers_2008-2010.php">Corporate Taxpayers and Corporate Tax Dodgers, 2008-2010</a>. </p>
<p>As Andrew Leonard reports today, the study shows that 37 of the country&#8217;s largest corporations paid zero taxes in 2010.</p>
<blockquote><p>In 2010, Verizon reported an annual profit of nearly $12 billion. The statutory federal corporate income tax rate is 35 percent, so theoretically, Verizon should have owed the IRS around $4.2 billlion. Instead, according to figures compiled by the Center for Tax Justice, the company actually boasted a <em>negative tax liability</em> of $703 million. Verizon ended up making even more money <em>after</em> it calculated its taxes.</p>
<p>Verizon is hardly alone, and isn’t even close to being the worst offender. Perhaps most famously, General Electric raked in $10.5 billion in profit in 2010, yet ended up reporting $4.7 <em>billion</em> worth of negative taxes. The worst offender in 2010, as measured by its overall negative tax rate, was Pepco, the electricity utility that serves Washington, D.C. Pepco reported profits of $882 million in 2010, and negative taxes of $508 million — a negative tax rate of 57.6 percent.</p>

<p>Andrew Leonard, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/11/03/the_great_corporate_tax_scam/?source=newsletter">America&#8217;s Corporate Tax Obscenity</a>, Salon (Nov. 3, 2011).  Four industries&#8211;finance, utilities, oil/gas/natural resources and IT&#8211; reap huge windfalls from the current corporate tax code.  Those windfalls that aren&#8217;t likely to be eliminated in any &#8220;reform&#8221; that passes the right-wing Congress&#8211;just look at the current lobbying for maintaining the &#8220;active financing&#8221; exception for banks&#8217; passive income, an exception that allows banks to defer taxation on their passive earnings, unlike most other industries. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no way that a territorial tax system (that allows US corporations to continue moving active businesses offshore tax free and moving patents and other rights off shore to ensure that the income from the rights aren&#8217;t taxed in the US) combined with incredibly low rates will raise an appropriate amount of income from corporations.  It is a giveaway to the corporations that think they have now bought Congress. At the same time, as the CTJ report authors note, most of these reform schemes actually will allow corporations to move even more jobs and businesses offshore.  If we really wanted to enact good corporate tax reform, we&#8217;d remove the loopholes favoring big industries like Big Oil, get rid of the accelerated depreciation allowances that let companies expense long-term investments, require an &#8220;exit tax&#8221; of ordinary income on all appreciated assets and untaxed earnings whenever a corporation restructures itself into a foreign company or moves its active business assets abroad, and otherwise tighten up the corporate tax rules to ensure that corporations pay a fair share in taxes.</p>
<p> It is up to the people to show that they haven&#8217;t loss the power to take control in our democracy, but given the lack of understanding of tax and fiscal issues in this country, and the deep pockets of corporations to fund the Chamber and other group&#8217;s misleading information and distortion of facts on these issues, it is questionable whether US democracy can save itself.</p>
<p>Appendix:  Camp release about proposal for corporate tax &#8220;reform&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp (R-MI) unveiled an international tax reform discussion draft as part of the Committee&#8217;s broader effort on comprehensive tax reform that would lower top tax rates for both individuals and employers to 25 percent. In addition to rate cuts, the plan would transition the United States from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial system &#8211; a move virtually every one of America&#8217;s global competitors has already made.</p>
<p>Camp unveiled the draft legislative language with a specific request &#8211; that employers, academics, practitioners and workers provide comment and add their voices to the legislative process.</p>
<p>Commenting on the release of the proposal as a part of his overall approach to comprehensive tax reform, Camp stated, &#8220;Instead of having laws on the books that encourage hiring U.S. workers, our outdated international tax system encourages employers to keep profits and jobs outside of America. If we are serious about creating a climate for job creation, now is the time to adopt tax policies that empower American companies to become more competitive and make the United States a more attractive place to invest and create the jobs this country needs.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Ways and Means discussion draft would:</p>
<p>&#8211; Reduce the corporate tax rate to 25 percent &#8211; bringing it in line with the average of countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Committee continues to examine base broadening measures that will replace the revenue foregone by reducing the corporate tax rate, so these measures are reserved in the discussion draft for future release.</p>
<p>&#8211; Shift from a worldwide system of taxation to a territorial-based system. The new plan:</p>
<p>* Exempts 95 percent of overseas earnings from U.S. taxation when profits are brought back to the United States from a foreign subsidiary.</p>
<p>* Includes anti-abuse rules to ensure companies do not avoid paying their fair share of U.S. taxes.</p>
<p>* Frees up existing overseas earnings to be reinvested in America after they are taxed at a low rate in line with current repatriation proposals.</p>
<p>* Makes American companies more competitive on the global stage with little or no impact on the federal deficit.</p>
<p>In advocating the need for international tax reform, Camp cited several reasons why current U.S. tax policies are putting American employers and workers at a competitive disadvantage:</p>
<p>&#8211; America will soon have the highest corporate tax rates in the industrialized world: Only Japan has a higher corporate tax rate than America, which has a combined federal-state rate of 39.2 percent &#8211; and Japan has already indicated its intent to lower its rate.</p>
<p>&#8211; Our &#8220;worldwide&#8221; system of taxation is a remnant from the Cold War: While it has been 25 years since Congress reformed the tax code, it has been almost 50 years since it undertook a bottom-up review of our international tax laws. In other words, our international tax rules were written when the United States accounted for 50 percent of the global economy and had no serious competition from others.</p>
<p>&#8211; American employers face double taxation compared to their foreign competitors: As a result of our &#8220;worldwide&#8221; system of taxation, when U.S.-based companies try to bring profits back home, they must pay U.S. taxes on top of the tax they already pay in the foreign market U.S. tax laws encourage investing in a foreign country instead of bringing profits back home: Because U.S.-based employers face additional taxes if they bring their overseas earnings back to invest in the United States, it is cheaper for these companies to reinvest profits overseas instead of creating jobs here.</p>
<p>&#8211; America is losing ground: In 1960, U.S.-headquartered companies comprised 17 of the world&#8217;s largest 20 companies &#8211; that&#8217;s 85 percent. By 2010, just six &#8211; or a mere 30 percent &#8211; U.S.-headquartered companies ranked among the top 20.</p>
<p>&#8211; Our foreign competitors are actively reforming their tax laws: Other countries are actively reforming their international tax codes &#8211; giving employers lower rates and moving towards a territorial tax system. Countries like the United Kingdom, Canada, and Germany, have recently lowered their tax rates to spur job creation and economic growth. Yet, America is sitting on the sidelines doing nothing. The United States cannot sit back and watch jobs go overseas because the tax code provides such perverse incentives.</p>
