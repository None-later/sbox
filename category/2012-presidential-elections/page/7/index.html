<p>Bloomberg&#8217;s Jesse Drucker has been doing some research into presidential candidate Mitt Romney and come up with some interesting information&#8211;at least for those of us who find corporate involvement in aggressive tax shelter phantom loss generating schemes a worrisome problem. See Drucker, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-22/romney-as-auditing-chairman-saw-marriott-son-of-boss-tax-shelter-defy-irs.html">Romney as Audit Chair Saw Marriott Son of Boss Shelter Defy IRS</a>, Bloomberg.com (Feb. 22, 2012).</p>
<p>Mitt Romney has been on the board of Marriott INternational Inc. on and off since 1993, and has served as chair of the audit committee for 6 years. During that period, the company has used aggressive tax avoidance deals, including (i) the &#8220;Son of BOSS&#8221; tax shelter structure for generating artificial losses that could be used to offset gains from other sources, thus reducing taxable income and tax liabilities and (ii) shifting profits to a Luxembourg shell company. Marriott&#8217;s effective tax rate has been as low as 6.8%, even though the federal statutory rate for corporations is 35%.<br />These factoids demonstrate two things.</p>
<p><strong>First</strong>,<strong> as the Bloomberg.com article points out, Romney claims that his business experience is the primary reason that Americans should want to see him in the White House. Contrary to his claim, it seems to me that the more we hear about his business experience the less I think he is suited to the White House. </strong></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>At Bain Capital, as at most private equity firms, Romney was willing to reap millions from taking a stable, operating company and turning it into a bankrupt by leveraging it up, firing employees, and otherwise destroying the stable business. Yeah, sometimes the &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; worked and the company exited making profits. But often it didn&#8217;t, and the company wasn&#8217;t a loser until Bain Capital got hold of it. Further, Romney doesn&#8217;t appear to have developed much of a sense of corporate social responsibility through his &#8220;earning&#8221; of multi-millions taxed at low rate through Bain Capital. So he didn&#8217;t see anything amiss in the very aggressive tax planning engaged in by Marriott when he served as a Marriott director with oversight responsibility&#8211;of which he certainly knew, as head of the audit committee. Even John McCain was aghast at Marriott&#8217;s wanton use of tax shelters, when he complained about the federal tax credits Marriott claimed in an accidental loophole in the law on synthetic fuels. As the piece notes, McCain called Marriott&#8217;s use of this loophole to claim the credits an &#8220;expensive hoax&#8221; or &#8220;scam.&#8221; </p>
<p>Do we want as president a man who thinks it is okay for taxpayers to gin up artificial losses to reduce their tax liability or use provisions of the Code in ways that clearly go against their underlying purpose to get an unintended subsidy from the Federal government? I don&#8217;t think so. Such a person would likely be quite willing to see further cuts to the corporate taxes and taxes on the wealthy, no matter what that does to the federal fisc. And Romney has certainly demonstrated his willingness to cut taxes even in the face of deficit claims that are being used to demand privatization of Social Security and cuts to Medicare. (See his plan for a 25% corporate rate, a zero percent estate tax, a lower top rate on earned income for the wealthy, and other items.) </p>
<p>I want a president who considers that every taxpayer has an obligation to the integrity of the system, and who would not look kindly on businesses that engage in aggressive tax minimization transactions that don&#8217;t hold up to the laugh test.</p>
<p><strong>Second, major corporations aren&#8217;t paying enough&#8211;much less too much &#8211;in taxes these days. </strong>We have a statutory rate of 35%, but most very profitable corporations end up paying very little in taxes, through a combination of excessive loopholes built into the Code by their accommodating buddies in Congress (quid pro quo for campaign contributions or, after Citizens United, &#8220;independent&#8221; super-PAC donations?) and outright tax sheltering through aggressive customized transactions intended to generate tax benefits. </p>
<p>Why in the world would anybody in his/her right mind propose cutting the corporate tax rate in this context of minimal tax payments by corporations? Makes no sense at all. Get rid of the loopholes. Bear down with enforcement clout on the phony tax-loss shelters. But don&#8217;t cut the corporate tax rate. There&#8217;s absolutely no substance to the constant whine we hear from corporate lobbyists that the corporate tax code is &#8220;too complex&#8221; (my JD students in corporate tax are quite capable of understanding it, so I am sure Corporate Tax Counsel are, too); or that the corporate tax code is &#8220;anticompetitive&#8221; (Marriott is making a fine rate of return); or that the corporate tax code is &#8220;preventing investments&#8221; (corporations have lots of cash floating around&#8211;if they want to make expansion investments, they can do so already).</p>
<p>Tax policy should be based on reasonable considerations of efficiency and simplicity, not exorbitant and unfounded claims of how the tax code is wrecking business. But even more importantly, tax policy should be based on fairness considerations. And Romney hasn&#8217;t shown much understanding of what fairness is, or how to make the tax code fairer rather than even more of a government program for redistribution upwards.</p>

                                <p>Peter Beinart in <i>The Daily Beast</i> points us to the crazy nature of our current attitude regarding attacking Iran in <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/02/21/experts-say-iraq-attack-is-irrational-yet-hawks-are-winning-the-debate.html" target="_blank">The Crazy Rush to Attack Iran</a>.  He lists and quotes an impressive series of experts familiar with the the last decades wars, and finally asks:  </p>
<blockquote><p>Can you find former military and intelligence officials who are more sympathetic to a strike? Sure. But in my lifetime, I&#8217;ve never seen a more lopsided debate among the experts paid to make these judgments. Yet it barely matters. So far, the Iran debate has been a rout, with the Republican presidential candidates loudly declaring their openness to war and President Obama unwilling to even echo the skepticism of his own security chiefs.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>And who are the hawks who have so far marginalized the defense and intelligence establishments in both Israel and the U.S.? They&#8217;re a collection of think-tankers and politicians, most absolutely sincere, in my experience. But from Rick Santorum to John McCain to Elliott Abrams to John Bolton, their defining characteristic is that they were equally apocalyptic about the threat from Iraq, and equally nonchalant about the difficulties of successfully attacking it. The story of the Iraq debate was, in large measure, the story of their triumph over the career military and intelligence officials &#8211; folks like Eric Shinseki and Joseph Wilson &#8211; whose successors are now warning against attacking Iran.   </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>How can it be, less than a decade after the U.S. invaded Iraq, that the Iran debate is breaking down along largely the same lines, and the people who were manifestly, painfully wrong about that war are driving the debate this time as well? Culturally, it&#8217;s a fascinating question &#8211; and too depressing for words.</p></blockquote>

                                <div>According to an article in today’s New York Times, Bain Capital was asked to do so, but declined.  Well, actually it was asked to help GM out, and declined.</p>
<p>The article recounts much of the controversy concerning Romney’s actual position on a government bailout for the companies back in 2008-09 and his current statements about it, and how these are playing out now politically here in Michigan and possibly in other states in which there is a heavy auto-industry presence.  About two-thirds down, the article says:</p></div>
<div></div>
<div>To go through the bankruptcy process, both companies needed billions of dollars in financing, money that auto executives and government officials who were involved with Mr. Obama’s auto task force say was not available at a time when the credit markets had dried up. The only entity that could provide the $80 billion needed, they say, was the federal government. No private companies would come to the industry’s aid, and the only path through bankruptcy would have been Chapter 7 liquidation, not the more orderly Chapter 11 reorganization, these people said.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In fact, the task force asked Bain Capital, the private equity company that Mr. Romney helped found, if it was interested in investing in General Motors’ European operations, according to one person with direct knowledge of the discussions.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Bain declined, this person said, speaking anonymously to discuss private negotiations.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is an especially serious matter because the very foundation of Romney’s candidacy is his vaunted business acumen.  If he really believed that private funding existed for managed bankruptcies of these two companies, then he based that belief on something other than fact, something other than evidence.  And if, as is likely, he well knew that no private funding would be available, and that without government funding these companies’ bankruptcies would be liquidations, then why was he claiming otherwise?

                                <p>This article in the New York Times (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/us/even-critics-of-safety-net-increasingly-depend-on-it.html?pagewanted=1" target="_blank">Even critics of the Safety Net</a>) presents a gentle desription of some voter feelings about the political and economic &#8216;issues&#8217; of this economy and election. I have a lot of different feelings about the description of people interviewed.  The current media surrounding the election campaigning does not allow for voter foibles and confusions, and appears to demand stark responses so far.  I do wish the author could have pressed for more thinking on the part of the people interviewed to illustrate how such ambivalence plays out in real life.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:  I will have a post taking a look at the author&#8217;s writing, which is actually a piece of propaganda if you follow the statements of &#8216;fact&#8217; and lack of easily added context for the figures and stated problems.  Hence the author chose (or the editors, perhaps) instead  to promote the confusions without educating readers or those interviewed.</p>

                                <p>by Linda Beale<br />Santorum&#8217;s Tax Returns Out</p>
<p>News Sources report Santorum has released tax returns. I&#8217;m on my way to San Diego for the ABA Tax Section meeting, so haven&#8217;t had a chance to peruse. But a tax rate of around 25-27% for 2007-2010 on income ranging from $659,000 in 2007 to more than a million in 2009 shows Santorum paid a considerably higher share of his income in taxes than did Romney (at not quite 14%).</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>**This appears to be incorrect.  It was based on <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/45979278">a story that CNBC has now updated</a>.  It was &#8220;Bain Consulting,&#8221; not Bain &#038; Co., that advised the government on re-financing the automobile companies. &#8212; klh </p>
<p>Ah!  Mystery Solved! Yesterday,in my post, &#8220;<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/02/crony-capitalism-on-grand-scale.html">Crony Capitalism On A Grand Scale</a>&#8220;—the title of the post borrowed from an op-ed piece by Romney in yesterday&#8217;s Detroit News characterizing the auto bailouts that way—I noted that Romney seems unaware that both companies filed for bankruptcy.  Romney says, as apparently he says often when forced at gunpoint to explain his opposition to those bailouts, that he was for the idea of &#8220;managed bankruptcy&#8221; for both companies, and never actually acknowledges that that is what happened.  Much less that these bankruptcies were &#8220;managed,&#8221; and therefore were able to emerge from bankruptcy as ongoing enterprises rather than as pieces of physical assets, machinery and the like, for a Bain Capital-owned company in the process of being restructured, to scavenge and resell.</p>
<p>This was a mystery to me. Sure, Romney regularly makes up facts to match Tea Party of Club for Growth ideology.  But in Michigan,everyone—<i>everyone</i>—knows that GM and Chrysler went through formal bankruptcy proceedings.  In court. How, I wondered, did he expect to get away with pretending that these companies didn&#8217;t go through managed bankruptcies?</p>
<p>Ah! Mystery solved! In an ABC News report last night by Chris Bury (a genuine news reporter,not a pundit disguised as one, and a long-ago favorite of mine from back when he was reporting for Nightline), illustrates the impact of the bailouts on Michigan’s economy, which is suddenly resurgent.  And in the report, which is today’s Yahoo News highlighted ABC NEWS video, explains what Romney means by “managed bankruptcy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Turns out, he means, best as I can tell anyway, that private equity firms lend the corporation the money to get through bankruptcy, in exchange for ownership of the company after its emergence from bankruptcy.  In the case of GM and Chrysler, many tens of billions of dollars.  In an op[ed in the New York Times back then, he described the managed bankruptcy he had in mind as one in which the government would guarantee private loans, but it would not itself provide the financing.  Which raises the question of how, exactly, this would have saved the government money, since the companies are repaying the government the loans to the extent possible.</p>
<p>But it also raises the question of Romney’s recommendation that the government play Russian Roulette with the auto industry.  Bury’s report points out that Bush Administration officials who put together the initial bailout legislation recognized, as did the Obama administration officials who took over, that the chance was nil that private equity money in such large sums would be forthcoming.  And why he conflates ideology with fact, even when the stated fact is baldly nonsensical. &#8220;If(automakers) get the bailout … you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye,&#8221; Bury’s report quotes Romney as saying in that New York Times op-ed.  Destroying the industry by saving it?</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an editorial in today&#8217;s Washington Post* says,in complaining about Obama&#8217;s proposal to raise taxes on bailed-out banks in order (the editorial says) to cover the auto bailouts:</p>
<blockquote><p>TARP was the price the country paid for a public good — financial stability — that the country needed. It&#8217;s inconsistent for the president to hail the bailout of one private industry —autos — while playing politics with the bailout of another — banking — that was and is no less necessary to a modern economy. It compounds the inconsistency to demand that the latter pay for the former.</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently the [Post]&#8217;s editorial board thinks GM and Chrysler caused the housing bubble and sold subprime mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;<br />*The sentence has been corrected to say that the editorial is in today&#8217;s Washington Post. Originally, the sentence said incorrectly that the editorial is in today&#8217;s Wall Street Journal.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<div>***Yup.  Definitely incorrect.  See my above post on the subject. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As I just wrote in response to a comment, I&#8217;m still sorta dismayed that the title of my post was treated, even by a PR firm representing (I guess) Bain, as a representation of fact rather than as the sarcasm that it pretty clearly was.

<div></div>
<div>Oh, well.

<p>Lifted from comments at <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2845094/posts" target="_blank">Free Republic</a> website regarding Newt&#8217;s speech at CPAC earlier this week (and a spirited debate of advocates for Santorum and Romney) comes this note from a Newt admirer regarding Newt&#8217;s downsizing the &#8216;federal government&#8217; in the 1990&#8217;s (and to his credit linked appropriately).  He uses one of Mike&#8217;s early charts on executive branch civilian employment measures of compararing Presidents:  <br />
<blockquote>To: American Constitutionalist  </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>Chart of federal civilian employees&#8230;big decline under the Newtster, even while the economy was booming. The decline leveled off post-Newtster. We can see the Carter/Bush eras saw declines in their recessions but Newt kept it going in good economic times.  </div>

<p>Another commenter not linked to here chased the link (to his/her credit) to the OMB tables and but then came to the conclusion Mike made up the numbers.</p>
<p>I am not proposing cosmic signigicance here, but a scratch of the head and a &#8216;WTF&#8217;.   As a leftie I suppose the conclusion could be that President Clinton found Newt&#8217;s tenure as Speaker so less than challenging he decided that he didn&#8217;t need the staff.  Aside from all the other business.  Thanks Ken for the idea.   🙂</p>

<blockquote>These days, I probably spend more time speaking to reporters (from as far away as Brazil and Italy) about Super PACs than about any other election law subject.  There is a lot of misinformation floating out there about what Super PACs are, where they came from, the relationship to Citizens United, and the ability of super PACs to coordinate with candidates without running afoul of the FEC disclosure rules.  For those looking for basic information from what I’ve written, I point reporters to my <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/01/09/opinion/hasen-super-pacs/index.html?eref=rss_topstories&#038;utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed%3A%20rss%2Fcnn_topstories%20%28RSS%3A%20Top%20Stories%29">recent CNN oped</a>, <a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=28207">this blog post</a> on whether <em>Citizens United</em> created Super PACs, and t<a href="http://electionlawblog.org/?p=28617">his blog post</a> which highlights the kinds of coordination which are currently permissible under FEC rules.<br /><strong>&#8230;</strong><br /><strong>. The Secret Money is Shifting to 501c4s, and It Demands a Legislative Response. </strong>Last night ace election lawyer Rob Kelner <a href="https://twitter.com/#">tweeted</a>: “Biggest story today: Crossroads’ c4 raised more than its Super PAC. Confirming that media is missing the boat by focusing on Super PACs.”</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote> My big concern before yesterday was that we would see a lot of transfers of money from 501c4s to affiliated Super PACs to shield the identity of donors to Super PACs. I’m still trying to get a handle on how much of this took place (apparently less than I thought). But the reason these transfers are not taking place is that it appears the 501c4s are engaging in much more <em>direct </em>election-related activity than they have in the past. That is, we are seeing some 501c4s becoming pure election vehicles. The relation of 501c4s to super pacs is now like the past relation between 527s and pacs—these are now the vehicles of questionable legality to influence elections. While <a href="http://www.mediteerenian.salon.com/2012/01/31/congress_can_fix_the_super_pac_problem/singleton/">Adam Skaggs</a> is rightly focused on fixing the coordination rules for Super PACs, this seems to be fighting yesterday’s war already. The key is to stop 501c4s from becoming shadow super PACs. Yes, campaign finance reform community, it has become this bad: I want <em>more</em> super PACs, because the 501c4 alternative is worse&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Guest post:  The Obama Record after 3 years &#8211; Jobs and GDP</strong></p>
<p>The performance of the economy over President Obama’s tenure to date has been much discussed in light of the severe contraction that began in December 2007 .. and the policies implemented to correct course and restore growth. As of early 2012, the economic recovery shows signs of gathering momentum. Since the enactment of the Recovery Act .. and especially now with the presidential campaign season heating up .. misrepresentations have been piling up. Despite the fact that the economy has been creating jobs for 22 consecutive months, his opponents continue to attack his record … a recent example: <em>“This president has been on the attack and has been a job killer,”</em> GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney told a town hall meeting in Salem, N.H. Another example: <em>“Either the president’s economic policies are killing this economy, or his lack of leadership,”</em> Rick Santorum said in September. <em>“Either way, President Obama is to blame.”</em></p>
<p>Here’s the<strong> factual record</strong> on economic growth and private sector job growth. In both cases, the graph displays the data points from the beginning of January 2007, showing the run-up to the Recession, followed by the enactment of the Recovery Act and the subsequent recovery through December 2011.</p>
<p>The two graphs below display:<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Quarterly Real GDP, Q1 2007 though Q3 2011, sourced from BEA NIPA table 1.1.6 <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=6&#038;FirstYear=2010&#038;LastYear=2011&#038;Freq=Qtr">here:</a><br />Private Sector Jobs, monthly net change January 2007 through December 2011, sourced from the BLS data series CES0500000001<a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ce"> here:</a></p>
<p><strong>Quarterly Real GDP Q1 2007 – Q3 2011, billions 2005 dollars:</strong><br /><strong><img alt="" src="http://i823.photobucket.com/albums/zz151/hagagatan/image001-29.png"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Net Private Sector Jobs January 2007 – December 2011, month-over-month change (000s):</strong><br /><strong><img alt="" src="http://i823.photobucket.com/albums/zz151/hagagatan/image001-27.png"></strong></p>
<p>As the historical record clearly shows, the economy has rebounded to pre-recession levels in both economic output and private sector job growth. Since NBER declared an end to the Recession (June 2009), the economy restored almost 700 billion in real GDP and has added a net 1,992,000 private sector jobs. Moreover, from January 2010 through December 2011, the business sector has generated net job growth of over 3,000,000 jobs. The partisan rhetoric simply doesn’t match the record.</p>

<blockquote>But Gingrich seems to have noticed that the key to his South Carolina landslide last weekend was <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/01/23/rich_republicans_sure_love_mitt/">overwhelming support</a> from blue-collar and middle-class Republican voters. With those making between $30,000 and $50,000 a year, Gingrich crushed Romney by 20 points. With those making between $50,000 and $70,000, the margin was 16. But at the top end of the scale, it was a completely different story: Romney won by 15 points with voters making more than $200,000.<br />As <a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/01/23/rich_republicans_sure_love_mitt/">I noted the other day</a>, this same basic dynamic was evident in New Hampshire and Iowa, where exit polls found a direct relationship between enthusiasm for Romney and income level.<br /><a href="http://www.salon.com/2012/01/25/the_trouble_with_being_the_swiss_bank_account_guy/?source=newsletter">via Salon</a>.</p></blockquote>
