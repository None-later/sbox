<p><strong>Stop Acting Surprised</strong></p>
<p>It seems a lot of Democrats seem surprised that Obama is willing to give up on what they view as core principles.  On the Republican side, there seems to be an implicit understanding that pretending the economic mess and spending began under Obama&#8217;s watch, and thus the policies that they favor (most of which Obama has continued, whether they admit it or not) bear no responsibility for where we are today.  As a reminder that reality is what it is, even if memory is weak and feeble, I&#8217;d like to repost something <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/11/role-of-president-elect-before-jan-20.html">I wrote a few days after Obama was elected</a> in its entirety below:  </p>
<p><strong>Is Obama Starting Poorly?</strong></p>
<p>One of the things that worried me about Obama was that he (like McCain) supported the ridiculous bail-out bill. As <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/welfare-queen.html">I noted</a> when it passed, it wasn&#8217;t going to work, and the net effect would be this:<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p>&#8230;shady, undeserving characters will be enriched, young versions of the idiots who got us into the mess will launch successful careers (can you say &#8220;Kashkari&#8221;?), and the promised benefits to the American public, the schmucks footing the bill, will never materialize.</p></blockquote>
<p>We now know the banks are not loaning out money which was the thing this whole bail-out was supposed to accomplish, but Goldman, Welfare, Queen, &#038; Sachs (to borrow a term from Lambert Strether left at the previous post) has made out like the proverbial bandit, Kashkari&#8217;s career is made, and the American public would be better off being beaten with a stick than having to pay for this garbage. </p>
<p>Sure, the idea for this was rammed down everyone&#8217;s throat by the administration and Bernanke, but the Dem leadership guided it through, and Obama voted for the bail-out. To me, it was the financial equivalent of invading Iraq because Osama hit us on 9/11. I can understand that at the time, many people thought something absolutely positively had to be done. Even many smart people who aren&#8217;t crooks &#8211; just folks who are too decent to be cynical enough to anticipate what this administration will do when you let them, felt the gubmint had to act, and act fast. So I can understand Obama voting for this piece of $%^&#038;.</p>
<p>But, now that we know the thing not working, and Paulson isn&#8217;t even pretending it was intended to work as advertised, isn&#8217;t it time to pull the plug? Shouldn&#8217;t the President-elect be out there, demanding an end to this waste of money? Shouldn&#8217;t he be calling on Congress to pull back the money that hasn&#8217;t already been thrown away? Shouldn&#8217;t he be proposing some other alternative? (If the problem, as we were told a while back, is that banks aren&#8217;t loaning money, and they&#8217;re still not loaning money, why is it worse for gubmint to loan money directly to people and corporations that need it than it is for the gubmint to find all sorts of ways to help Paulson&#8217;s former employer?) Instead, there&#8217;s all this talk about spending even more money on even more undeserving people and companies in a wider variety of industries, and Obama is not saying anything to discourage any of this. </p>
<p>I understand that the man hasn&#8217;t even been inaugurated yet, and I stand by what I wrote not long ago &#8211; I&#8217;m willing to give him a chance. (Heck, I voted for him.) But this bodes ill. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Now, its been a few years, and we still have a problem.  There&#8217;s no demand.  Consumers are sitting on their hands.  Companies are sitting on their hands.  Banks are sitting on their hands.  Which leads to a second post I wrote <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/11/how-to-bail-out-economy-less-wrong-way.html">a few days later</a>, which I&#8217;m also reproducing in its entirety:</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p><strong>How To Bail Out the Economy &#8211; A Less Wrong Way</strong></p>
<p>Regular readers know I&#8217;ve had post after post explaining why a bail-out would be a bad idea and would not work, dating to long before the bail-out began. I predicted that the end result would be the further enrichment of some of the very folks who brought us this mess and junior versions of the same folks who were too young to get in on the original crime spree, but otherwise, we&#8217;d have nothing to show for the trillions that would get spent.</p>
<p>The supposed &#8220;rationale&#8221; for this bail-out is to make sure that companies that are willing and able to produce goods and services that consumers wish to purchase are able to do so, and that in turn consumers are willing and able to purchase goods and services that companies want to bring to market. The story line is that this can be accomplished by giving money to the financial sector, that sector of the economy that for the past few years has specialized in selling squirrel meat as fillet mignon. Give those talented folks some money to make up the massive losses pulled off in the past years and they will happily loan money to producers and consumers, we are told. </p>
<p>Its becoming obvious even to the likes of Henry Paulson that no matter how much money gets paid to Goldman, Welfare, Queen &#038; Sachs and Citi and Countrywide and the rest of &#8217;em, the &#8220;financial system&#8221; of old is gone forever. Compensating buyers of squirrel meat is more than enough burden on the taxpayer, but it seems we&#8217;re expected to make Goldman, Welfare, Queen &#038; Sachs whole for paying the exorbitant salaries of folks like Henry Paulson in the past, and the current and future generations of Henry Paulson to boot. Clearly this is not only a very, very, indirect way to keep companies producing and consumers buying, its also adding a bunch of layers of unnecessary expenses.</p>
<p>So&#8230; if the goal is to stimulate production and/or consumption, why not cut out the unnecessary layers of exorbitant expense? I&#8217;m not sure I see the reason for bailing out car companies, but say that was the goal for some reason. In that case, the government could simply buy a $20K car for every single American, every single one, and spend less than the $7 trillion that&#8217;s been committed so far. That&#8217;s well over 30 times as many cars as GM made last year. Worldwide. You could bet the car companies would tool up for this, and it would employ a lot of people, and it would stimulate the economy. Additionally, we&#8217;d all have another car thrown in. Sure, it might be a GM vehicle, but its still something, which is more than the nothing we&#8217;re gonna get from pumping it into the Goldman, Welfare, Queen &#038; Sachs black hole. Heck, it doesn&#8217;t have to be cars &#8211; the gubmint could simply commit to spending $20,000 on something, anything each of us picks. You could take your 20 G and spend it on a menu of American made options.</p>
<p> Preposterous, you say? Inflationary, you say? Jingoistic, you say? Sure, I say. Its a stupid idea and I don&#8217;t like it all. But I think its a much better idea than the current bail-out approach, which I think is worse than taking (for now) $7 trillion and setting it on fire. Giving the money to the likes of Henry Paulson&#8217;s former employer is simply rewarding bad behavior and sending the wrong message, not to mention preposterous, inflationary, and jingoistic.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>So&#8230;  <strong>to summarize a few things that seemed obvious to me a few years ago and yet which I&#8217;m finding today aren&#8217;t part of the narrative any more:</strong></p>
<p>1.  The government response to the problem began long before Obama took office.<br />2.  The government response to the problem wasn&#8217;t going to have any positive effect since it addressed a non-existent problem (i.e., poor decision making on on Wall Street) and didn&#8217;t address the actual problem (i.e., weak aggregate demand on Main Street).  <br />3.  The government response to the problem was going to have a negative effect since it was extremely costly.<br />4.  By the time of the 2008 election, the sitting administration had abandoned the rationale for the government response, but maintained that response regardless.<br />5.  By the time of the 2008 election, Republican and Democratic leaders, including Barack Obama, knew the sitting administration had abandoned the rationale for the government response and yet were continuing that response regardless, and nobody complained.</p>
<p>In a sane world, the folks who let things get where they are, including pretty much all our esteemed members of Congress and our esteemed President, would not be allowed to be involved in &#8220;solving the problem&#8221; now.  Most economists who had some input into the previous &#8220;solutions&#8221; or who cheerleaded for them would also be shown the door.  But that&#8217;s not where we are.  </p>
<p>The solution to our current mess is obvious, and was obvious a few years ago.  Equally obvious is that we won&#8217;t be going anywhere near that solution.  But if you&#8217;re wondering what the world would look like if we did follow the obvious solution, just remember&#8230;  the last time the economy took a tumble like this, and was further exacerbated by bad policy response was 1929-1932.  In 1933, four years after the proverbial doo doo first hit the fan, the correct policy response was finally implemented.  Real economic growth rates for ten of the next 11 years exceeded 5% a year.  Real economic growth rates for nine of the next 11 years exceeded 8% a year.  Real economic growth rates for five of the next 11 years exceeded 10% a year.  (Data <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls">here</a>.)</p>
<p>It has now been almost four years since the doo doo hit the fan this time around.  Does anyone expect we&#8217;re going to see that kind of performance  this time around?</p>

<p>Assume that Michelle Bachmann wins the Republican nomination next year and Obama wins re-election.  Given Obama&#8217;s governing style (i.e., fold early, fold often), in what way will the outcome of Obama&#8217;s final five years in office (i.e., next year plus the second term) differ from the outcome GW would produce were he President?  And how would the outcome be different if Michelle Bachmann wins the Presidential election? </p>
<p>Assume that Mitt Romney wins the Republican nomination next year and Obama wins re-election.  Given Obama&#8217;s governing style (i.e., fold early, fold often), in what way will the outcome of Obama&#8217;s final five years in office (i.e., next year plus the second term) differ from the outcome GW would produce were he President?  And how would the outcome be different if Mitt Romney wins the Presidential election? </p>
<p>Assume that Mitt Romney of the year 2000 wins the Republican nomination next year and Obama wins re-election.

                                <p>Guest post by <strong>Nancy Ortiz</strong> </p>
<p>(Rdan here&#8230;Nancy is a long time reader of Angry Bear and has worked within the Social Security system professionally)</p>
<p>One of the many fixes now being considered as a remedy for Social Security and Medicare&#8217;s projected shortfalls is means testing benefits. The rationale is that rich people shouldn&#8217;t get SS because &#8220;they don&#8217;t need it.&#8221; Many people who ought to know better believe this would save a great deal of money and help fix the 2037 benefit gap. Sorry, people. This idea isn&#8217;t worth the paper it&#8217;s rotten on (as Dorothy Parker once said about someone else&#8217;s screen play). The short and long of it is that it costs more to means test benefits than to pay SS benefits without regard to the beneficiary&#8217;s income and assets. <a name="more"></a>   <br />How do I know this is true? The Social Security Administration (SSA) administers two programs: the basic SS program and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), a means-tested federal public assistance program for poor aged, blind and disabled people. You have to have worked 40 quarters to receive SS, but no work is required for SSI. It is a &#8220;welfare&#8221; program, not a social insurance program. SSI began on Jan. 1, 1974. In the intervening years, SSA has had plenty of experience trying to run this complex and challenging program. It has learned that SSI costs at least 7 times more dollar for dollar to administer than its regular SS program.  <br />There are many reasons. The federal government establishes overall SSI eligibility and payment levels, but each state can pay optional amounts over and above those required by federal law. In effect, there are 50 different SSI programs across the country. Earlier this week, CBS ran an article online with an account of a House Ways and Means Committee hearing about SSA&#8217;s improper benefit payments. Here&#8217;s the link. <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/14/in_depth_us/main20071107.shtml">http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/14/in_depth_us/main20071107.shtml</a>    <br />SSA was third in the list of federal agencies making improper payments to its beneficiaries and recipients. The first two in order were DHHS (Medicare, Medicaid, and TANF with $71.4 billion ) and DOL (Unemployment benefits $17.5 billion). DOD is not mentioned in this article presumably because the amount of DOD&#8217;s improper payments cannot be determined. SSA&#8217;s total was $8 billion, including $4 billion in improper SSI  payments, out of a total of $650 billion in benefits paid for all programs.     <br />Congress has underfunded SSA since the 1980&#8217;s, sometimes more&#8211; sometimes less, but consistently for at least 30 years. The agency is  understaffed as a result. This has produced a 10% error rate in SSI payments as compared to a .05% error rate in SS benefits. This is because SSI is very labor intensive. The recipients are poor, often functionally or completely illiterate, and don&#8217;t speak English well or at all. Interviews are longer, the topics covered more complex, the documentation requirements much more extensive than in the SS program. Furthermore, you have to reinterview recipients frequently to be sure they&#8217;re still eligible. So, not only is it harder to process the claims to begin with but also you have to do the work all over again every year. If you don&#8217;t have the staff, you can&#8217;t do the work fast enough or accurately enough to produce a low error rate.     <br />SSA&#8217;s Inspector General summed up the state of SSA&#8217;s efforts to improve payment accuracy in his statement for the record at Ways and Means&#8217; hearing. See <a href="http://waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/ocarrol222.pdf">http://waysandmeans.house.gov/UploadedFiles/ocarrol222.pdf</a>  SSA plans to spend $796M on quality control in 2011 and at least as much in 2012, budget permitting. This includes local office and end-of-line quality reviews, studies to determine causes of error, costs for computer matches in-house and out-of-house, Continuing Disability Reviews, redeterminations of eligibility, and the like. There are many more ways to reduce payment errors. But they cost more money than the ones listed above.     <br />In SSI or any other means-tested program today, all income and any assets, no matter how small in dollar or market value, have to be reported. Any change in stated income and assets must be reported, recorded and verified. If the parents of a disabled child work, for example, they have to report all changes in their income whenever they occur. People who enter or leave the household cause a change in the payment level. Gifts of money or determinable value can reduce payments. Ownership of real estate other than a principle residence also count against the asset limit of $2000.00 for an individual ($3000.00 for a couple). So, if the recipient is a tenant in common in real estate having a value over the limit, s/he is ineligible. This is common in intestate estates in which numerous relatives may have a share in unmarketable rural property. I could go on, but your eyes are already glazing over.   <br />The obvious response is to say that means testing SS could be designed in such a way as to get around these problems.  But, the fact is that the limits set on income and assets are absolute dollar limits not subject to waiver or tolerances. So, means testing means one thing and one thing only. You have to check and recheck everything that affects eligibility every year for every eligible person. And, that takes staff which costs money. About 50 million people receive SS and SSI benefits. I cannot even guess what it would cost to handle that many new eligibility determinations. We must look elsewhere to find a fix for the coming SS benefit gap. </p>

<p>Alex Knapp asks his readers to <a href="http://www.outsidethebeltway.com/newt-campaign-slogan-open-thread/">suggest a campaign slogan for Newt Gingrich</a>.  He suggests:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Gingrich 2012: He will always love America. Unless it gets cancer.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I suggest this:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Cheating out of <a href="http://www.aolnews.com/2011/03/09/newt-gingrich-my-love-of-america-made-me-love-a-lot-of-other-th/">love for America</a>”</p></blockquote>
<p>But speaking seriously &#8211; how strong of a contender do you think Newt is for the Republican nomination?</p>

<p>Why I will not be Voting for Obama in 2012</p>
<p>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=417">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>The presidential elections are a year and a half away, but I am pretty certain of one thing:  I will not be voting to re-elect Barack Obama.  That does not mean that I will be voting for the Republican nominee, or for any of the third party candidates, but rather that I do not see any likely circumstances under which Barack Obama will do anything I think is necessary to earn my vote.  That may seem unusual because I voted for Obama, and my economic views are probably best described as slightly left center.  <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m nobody special, and my endorsement or lack of it isn&#8217;t going to make a whit of difference, but I suspect there are other people who are also somewhere close to slightly left of center (i.e., who are either what Obama considers to be his &#8220;natural constituency&#8221; or close enough that they can be convinced to vote for him rather than his likely eventual opponent) who are starting to think the same thing I am.  So perhaps its worth trying to explain why I feel the way I do.  I think its easiest to do that by discussing the issues I think I important and what Obama has done (or not) about them.</p>
<p>1.  Economic growth/unemployment/taxes.  These three topics, as Senator Ryan and all economists know, are closely inter-related.  Sadly, the relationship between these three topics is very, very different than Senator Ryan and most economists believe.  Getting the economy moving is vital after <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/06/economic-growth-rates-presidents-party.html">eight years of mediocre growth</a> under GW Bush, culminating in the Great Recession.  But when you go back as far as the data allows, you find <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=278">a quadratic relationship between the top marginal tax rate in one year and growth in the subsequent year </a>, and that we are at a point on the curve where it is an increase, not a decrease in tax rates, that is likely to lead to faster economic growth.  Even sticking to the period of relatively low taxes we’ve been in since Reagan started his tax cuts, <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=253">growth rates should go up and unemployment rates should go down </a> if tax rates go up.</p>
<p>There are two reasons this is true.  One is that taxes pay for the existence of the government.  The government provides services the government provides that are conducive to growth and which the private sector simply has not historically provided at non-negligible levels.  These services include national defense, monitoring and controlling epidemics, and building infrastructure.  </p>
<p>The government also provides some leadership that can make it possible for the private sector to adopt new technologies.  As an example – in this day and age, having a vehicle that could run on any mix of gasoline, ethanol or natural gas (depending on which is cheapest per mile) would be a nice thing to have.  You can buy one of those vehicles today… in Brazil.  Never heard of such a thing?  Well, there are millions of bi-flex and tri-flex vehicles on the road in Brazil today, made by such exotic companies as GM, Ford, Volkswagen, and Mercedes.  Why are there so many flex-fuel cars and motorcycles on the road in Brazil?  Because the Brazilian government realized you can’t get from 1970s fuel shortages to where they are now without someone forcing both auto makers and fuel stations to make changes simultaneously.  Without government action, auto makers wouldn’t have been willing to mass produce flex-fuel vehicles out of fear there would be no filling stations for those vehicles, and fueling stations would have been reluctant to make investments out of fear that there would be no vehicles to take advantage of them.  In other words, the situation we see in the U.S.</p>
<p>But there is another, perhaps more important reason, why higher tax rates often lead to faster economic growth and lower unemployment.  As I keep pointing out, any good business owner (and any lousy one, for that matter) will tell you, if you tax something more, you get less of it.  And income taxes can be seen as penalties on withdrawing money from one’s business for the purpose of consumption, which means they discourage business owners from taking profits out of their business.  The alternative to taking profits and consuming is re-investing in the business.  Thus, higher tax rates on income lead to more investment on business.  And this result is borne out empirically; when the top marginal rate is below 50%, a tax increase is correlated with more private investment and less private consumption. </p>
<p>2.  Deficits and the national debt.  This is another tax related issue.  Historically, during and following tax hikes <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=241">tax  collections /GDP rise</a>.  During and following tax cuts, tax collections fall.   (How a fact so basic that even a child could observe it in the data became a surprise to many people is a testament to, ahem, economists like Art Laffer and Thomas Sowell.  <br />But there are many ways to cut taxes people pay, and changing the marginal rate is only one such way.  Enforcement of tax law is another.  Since 1929 (that’s as far back as data is available) – every single Republican President decreased the tax burden, the percentage of people’s income paid in taxes, and thus far, <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=92">all Democrats but Truman and Obama have increased that percentage.</a>  Click on the link and you’ll also see that growth rates were much faster for Presidents who increased the tax burden than for Presidents who decreased it.  Though there are many ways of being fiscally responsible or irresponsible, it is, of course, easier to balance the budget if tax revenues are higher.  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/republican-party-and-national-debt.html">The last four Republican Presidents – Ford, Reagan, and the two Bushes all increased the national debt.</a>  Conversely, before Obama you had to go back to 1944, when the nation was fighting World War 2, to find a Democrat in the Oval Office who increased the national debt.  </p>
<p>And yes, I know, there was a bad recession going on when Obama took office, and the economy still sucks.  And yes, I agree with Keynes  &#8211; the data shows that expansions following recessions during which the government increased its spending <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=15">are longer and stronger than</a> when expansions following recessions during which the government cut spending.  But that spending should have been paid for  with tax hikes.  Historically, when the government raises taxes during or shortly after a recession, the resulting expansion is longer and stronger than when the government cuts taxes.  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=3">That’s what the data shows</a>.  The reasons are the same as given above in the discussion about economic growth, plus one:  during periods of economic weakness those in the private sector tend to sit on money.  </p>
<p>As an aside – it is worth noting that both this Great Recession and the Great Depression came <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=192">about half a decade after big reductions in both marginal tax rates and regulation.</a>  Coincidence?</p>
<p>3.  Obama’s performance might resemble that of other Democratic administrations more closely had he chosen economic advisors who paid more attention to data and were less enamored of the policies GW Bush was employing.  When you pick an advisor who <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">jumps through hoops to be like one of GW’s economic advisors</a>, you will get GW’s outcomes.  Its even worse <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/11/christy-romer-to-cea.html">when you’ve been warned</a> and you do it anyway.   Frankly, if I say so myself, it isn’t that difficult to find <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=174">people who actually can spot business cycles at both ends</a>.</p>
<p>4.  The bail-outs.  Of course, one of the big contributors to the Obama deficits are how Obama reacted to the poor state of the economy.  (In fairness, some of the bail-out spending was pre-committed by the previous administration, but then Obama voted in favor of that spending as a Senator and didn’t try to walk it back once he became President.)  But where are the prosecutions?  Was there not wrongdoing?  And then you have stories <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/the-real-housewives-of-wall-street-look-whos-cashing-in-on-the-bailout-20110411?print=true">like Matt Taibbi’s latest</a>.  Like GW’s policies before him, Obama’s approach seems almost designed create another mess.  </p>
<p>5.  Health care.  Obama care = Romney care.  This is a policy that Republicans were pushing a decade ago, and would still be pushing if a Democrat hadn’t proposed it.  Where is the public option?</p>
<p>6.  The wars.  I don’t have a solution, but then I didn’t spend a few hundred million bucks running for President, nor am I about to spend a billion dollars running for re-election.  It is the height of immorality to seek out the presidency or re-election in a time of war and yet have no clue how to bring the war to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p>I always thought it was the height of insanity for anyone to vote to re-elect GW in 2004, after screwing up the economy and two wars.  Yes, I know some <a href="http://www.hoover.org/publications/hoover-digest/article/7505">worthies were still talking “Mount Rushmore” a year or two later</a>, but one should be better than that.  And yes, there are a handful of things Obama did that GW might not do, but let’s be realistic – this has looked from the very beginning like GW’s third term.</p>
<p>Which leaves just one question – if the policies of the Republicans are even worse than Obama&#8217;s – and they tend to support anti-growth tax policies (calling them pro-growth doesn’t change the data), what should a rational person do?  I don’t know.  But I think if I’m going to see Republican policies enacted, I’d prefer to see them run under a Republican label.  See, Democratic policies may not be very good, but historically they have tended to produce  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=92">better results</a> than Republican policies.  (BTW &#8211; Michael Kanell and I have an entire book called Presimetrics looking at how Presidents performed on a wide range of topics.)  Another four years spent bringing the feeble Democratic brand down to the levels of the even more feeble Republican brand will cause lasting damage.</p>
