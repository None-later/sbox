<div>On Wednesday I posted here about Bella, my friend’s daughter’s three-year-old German shepherd/collie mix who suddenly started experiencing severe pain near the back of her spine last weekend and a day later became paraplegic.  A wonderful lady who’s active in animal shelter work took Bella this morning to see a highly-regarded vet who works closely with one of the shelters this lady is involved with.  The lady planned to keep Bella at her home indefinitely, until a permanent home could be found for her.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But the injury to Bella’s spine caused damage to her kidneys.  I don’t fully understand it; my friend was crying when she was telling me about it.  But the vet said Bella would die within a few days.  So, at the vet’s recommendation, the lady (my friend’s daughter had signed papers this morning relinquishing the doggie) agreed to have Bella put to sleep.
</p>

<div></div>
<div>But all dogs go to heaven.  All dog lovers know that.

<div>Thank you to everyone who responded to my earlier post.  It was much appreciated.
