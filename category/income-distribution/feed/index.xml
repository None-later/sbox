				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Via <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-03-14/why-grandpa-hasn-t-retired.html#disqus_thread">Bloomberg</a> comes this note on demographics and the work force, and continues a conversation about how that impacts all of us.  Probably not in the way most often provided in punditry&#8230;such as taking jobs away from the millenium generation, wealthy old geezers stereotypes, or alarms sounded about who is to pay for services we want, etc.  </p>
<p>It&#8217;s well known that the U.S. is turning gray. It&#8217;s less well known that the workforce is turning gray as well. The percentage of Americans who are 65 and older will rise from <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/05/why-does-us-health-care-cost-so-much-part-iii-an-aging-population-isnt-the-reason/">13 percent in 2010 to 20 percent by 2030</a> &#8212; and, if the recent trend continues, a growing share of those elderly Americans will carry on working past the normal retirement age.</p>
<p><img alt="Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics" src="http://www.bloomberg.com/image/iZomGtINy47A.jpg"><br />Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics</p>
<p>In 1990, 11.8 percent of those 65 and older worked. In 2010 the figure was 17.4 percent. By 2020, the <a href="http://www.bls.gov/emp/ep_table_303.htm">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> expects it to be 22.6 percent. The numbers are even more surprising for Americans older than 75. Less than 5 percent of them worked in 1990. In 2010, it was 7.4 percent. By 2020, according to the BLS, 10 percent of them will still be toiling away.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>David Zetland passes along some income figures via <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/10/oh-canada.html">Aguanomics</a> (re posted).  (Dan here&#8230;There are more American billionaires and millionaires, so not to worry) :</p>
<p>Cornelia and I were discussing household income and living standards, and I mentioned that median wages in the US were around $35,000.* She was shocked, saying that they were much higher in Canada.    <br />Wait. Canadians make more money than Americans? Yep. </p>
<p>[1] USD** Median household income   <br /><a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/income/data/historical/household/2011/H08_2011.xls">50,050 </a> USA<br /><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/famil108a-eng.htm">71,300</a> Canada<br />Household size   <br /><a href="http://2010.census.gov/mediacenter/awareness/us-house-stats.php">2.6 </a> USA<br /><a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/tables-tableaux/sum-som/l01/cst01/famil53a-eng.htm">2.5</a> Canada<br />[2] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28nominal%29_per_capita">USD GDP per capita</a> (2011 nominal)    <br />48,400 USA<br />50,400 Canada<br /><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_%28PPP%29_per_capita">USD GDP per capita</a> (2011 Purchasing-power-parity)    <br />48,400 USA<br />40,500 Canada<br />[3] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_income_equality">Gini Coefficient</a> (CIA, 100 = most unequal)    <br />45 USA<br />32 Canada<br />So here&#8217;s how I reconcile these numbers:
<ol>
<li>Median household income is nearly 40 percent higher in Canada, even after adjusting for the number of people in the household. </li>
<li>PPP GDP per capita is higher in the US by nearly 25 percent. This number, mind you, refers to total economic activity and cost of living, not income to individuals. </li>
<li>These numbers are reconciled via inequality: Canada is more egalitarian (similar to Spain and Italy) than the US (similar to Bulgaria and Iran), circa 2005-2007. <a href="http://www.aguanomics.com/2012/09/where-occupy-and-tea-party-failed.html">I reckon</a> that inequality has recently worsened in the US.</li>
</ol>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>So it seems that the income derived from economic activities in the US is skewed in distribution &#8212; with more going to rich people than the average person &#8212; compared to Canada.**   </p>
<p>Bottom Line: Canadians are well known for their higher levels of social harmony. This harmony may be due to a fairer distribution of income, but it&#8217;s also accompanied by a higher average incomes.*** Americans are both poorer AND less equal than their neighbors.  <br />
<hr>* <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_average_wage">Average wages in 2011</a> are $42,000 in the US and $32,600 in Canada, but those numbers do not account for employment (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_employment_rate">66.7% and 71.5%</a>, respectively) or the distribution of wages/capital gains. Right, Mitt?  <br />** Gross income is not the same as income net of taxes, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP">total taxes</a> are 27% of GDP in the US and 32% of GDP in Canada, but those rates ALSO do not take the distribution of the tax burden into account.   <br />*** My definition of the American Dream &#8212; &#8220;being able to do what you want&#8221; &#8212; does not match <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream">common definitions</a> that include upward mobility. That dream is &#8212; relative to the past and relative to other countries &#8212; <a href="http://www.ontheside.org/count/LSEreport.pdf">more dream than reality</a> [pdf].</p>
