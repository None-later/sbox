				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, without whose FRED database and Excel Add-in Economics Bloggers (and Matt Yglesias) would be Even More Boring, has been running a series of Discussions explaining why the Fed is incompetent—er, Why They Don&#8217;t Follow Their Dual Mandate—er, well, something about how They&#8217;re Doing The Best They Can.*</p>
<p>The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis will offer a live webcast of the finale of its fall evening discussion series for the general public, &#8220;Dialogue with the Fed: Beyond Today’s Financial Headlines,&#8221; on Monday, Nov. 21, 2011.</p>
<p>The dialogue will be streamed live from the St. Louis Fed&#8217;s Gateway Conference Center beginning at 7 p.m. CT/8 p.m. ET. It can be viewed at <a href="http://www.stlouisfed.org/live">www.stlouisfed.org/live</a>. No registration is necessary. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Christopher Waller, the St. Louis Fed’s senior vice president and director of research, will discuss &#8220;Understanding the Unemployment Picture.&#8221; After his presentation, Waller, along with St. Louis Fed economists David Andolfatto and Natalia Kolesnikova, will take questions from the on-site audience at the Bank.</p>
<p>If you cannot catch the live webcast, it will be archived and available on the St. Louis Fed web site within a few days of the event, along with videos of the first two dialogues. </p>

<p>Attend, enjoy, ask them about the Beige Book.  <a href="http://andolfatto.blogspot.com/">David Andolfatto</a> tries to be One of the Good Guys (well, for a Simon Fraser guy**, at least). Give him some love, attention, and Questions He Will Love to Answer.</p>
<p>*Whether you find this idea even more disappointing than the others is left as an exercise, unless you&#8217;re looking for work, in which case:
