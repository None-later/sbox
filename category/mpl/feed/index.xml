				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Peter Dorman at Econospeak, who is smarter and nicer than I am,* <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2011/02/are-bosses-always-right.html">boils down the question</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[D]o you believe that managers normally make the right decisions over how to run organizations?</p></blockquote>
<p>If you believe that premise, please explain:
<ol>
<li>Why all those great managers of the late 1940s through the mid-1970s ran defined benefit contribution plans, but their successors—who supposedly are more capable—are only capable of offering defined contribution?</li>
<li>That &#8220;underfunded pension benefits&#8221; are evil, but &#8220;overunded&#8221; pensions led to the LBO (now &#8220;Private Equity&#8221;) movement of the 1980s.</li>
<li>That, in the 1980s, GM being $1B underfunded caused Congress to pass a bill allowing pensions to become fully funded over 20 years—and that most of those targets were missed?</li>
</ol>
<p>If bosses are so good at managing &#8220;ongoing concerns,&#8221; why do they take their payments upfront?  What does—and should—this tell us about discount rates?</p>
<p>*This is a fairly low standard, outside of people who work in finance.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As a rule, the Shiller Index uses the CPI as reported for All Urban Consumers (CPIAUCNS on Fred(r)).</p>
<p>But the Index is only updated Quarterly, so monthly data is estimated.  Which produces a very interesting difference over August, not to mention September expectations:
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Ss_xZLlJlsI/AAAAAAAAASw/nbriKNDQJ6w/s1600-h/shillercpi.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Ss_xZLlJlsI/AAAAAAAAASw/nbriKNDQJ6w/s400/shillercpi.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The annualised inflation rate between June and August is 0.39%, which just shows that the trend is volatile.  But if there really is another round or two of 2.5% annual inflation, the projected 3% growth for Q3 is either going to look a lot more anemic than we think, or there is going to be a <strong>major</strong> producvtivity increase.</p>
<p>The odds of being paid the Marginal Product of Labor just dropped a bit more.</p>

<p>Via <a href="http://www.salon.com/opinion/greenwald/2008/09/23/brooks/index.html">Glenn Greenwald</a>, a riff that is going around (see <a href="http://orchidgrrlnyc.blogspot.com/">orchidgrrl nyc</a> for <a href="http://orchidgrrlnyc.blogspot.com/2008/09/channeling-fafblog.html">the faux-Fafblog version</a>), has become reality—<a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article4810644.ece">in India</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Corporate India is in shock after a mob of sacked workers bludgeoned to death the chief executive who had dismissed them from a factory in a suburb of Delhi.</p></blockquote>
<p>The punchline, as it were:<br />
<blockquote>It is understood that Mr Choudhary&#8230;had called a meeting with more than 100 former employees &#8211; who had been dismissed following an earlier outbreak of violence at the plant &#8211; to discuss a possible reinstatement deal.</p></blockquote>
<p>Any similarity to the mayor in The Dark Knight Returns is coincident.</p>
<p>AngryBear urges others <em>not</em> to follow this example. Surely there are better ways.</p>
