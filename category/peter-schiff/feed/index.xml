<p><a href="http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/peter-schiff-was-right">Crooks and Liar&#8217;s</a> posted this video, but their presentation seems more from a position of how correct Peter Shiff was.  I think what is more important, and a better lesson to learn is how much crap was being presented by Fox as real, reliable, truthful information that &#8220;you can use&#8221;.  Listen to the other &#8220;panelists&#8221;.  </p>
<p>If we do not learn to understand &#8220;crap&#8221; reporting, if we do not learn to understand story telling for selfish purpose, if we do not learn to understand that propagandizing is not solely a political tool, but more importantly an economic tool, we will not solve our&#8217;s and the worlds current economic condition.</p>
<p>What this video is, is the unvailing of one of the real life experiences of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/plotsummary">Truman show</a> we have been living in since Reagan, only this interpretation of the story used the constructed world of finance on the stage known as the economy.</p>
