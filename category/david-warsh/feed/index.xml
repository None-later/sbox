				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.economicprincipals.com/issues/2012.12.02/1442.html" target="_blank">David Warsh</a>, a journalistist covering economics issues, takes a look at Warren Buffet&#8217;s op ed at <i>Economic Principals.</i></p>
<blockquote><div>The fiscal cliff negotiation is no better than a skirmish in what promises to be an epic ten-year struggle to achieve a new fiscal compact. For evidence of that, consider Warren Buffett’s entry into the debate last week, with a suggestion that negotiators seek to bring in revenues at 18.5 percent and cap spending at about 21 percent of GDP.
</p>
</div>
<div>Those were levels that had been sustained over long periods of time in the past, Buffett wrote in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/26/opinion/buffett-a-minimum-tax-for-the-wealthy.html">op-ed column</a> in <em>The New York Times</em>; they could be reached again relatively quickly.</div>
<div>(Revenues were 15.5 percent of GDP in the fiscal year just ended, while spending was 22.4 percent.) His targets wouldn’t reduce the deficit, he wrote, but they would maintain a stable ratio of debt to output.</div>
<div>
<p>It was the right argument, but Buffett had the wrong numbers. He apparently borrowed them from the <a href="http://www.fiscalcommission.gov/">National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform</a>, led by Erskine Bowes and Alan Simpson, now more than two years old&#8230;</p>
