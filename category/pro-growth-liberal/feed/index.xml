<p>GDP Gap Stuck at 6%</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/data-bytes/gdp-bytes/government-spending-and-inventories-push-graowth-negative">Dean Baker</a> gets it right with respect to the latest news on GDP: <br />
<blockquote>A sharp drop in government spending, heavily concentrated in defense, coupled with a decline in inventories caused GDP to shrink at a 0.1 percent rate in the 4th quarter. Government spending fell at a 6.6 percent annual rate, driven by a 22.2 percent decline in defense spending, subtracting 1.33 percentage points from the growth rate in the quarter. A 40.3 drop in the rate of inventory accumulation reduced growth by another 1.27 percentage points. Without these factors, GDP would have grown at a 2.5 percent annual rate in the quarter. Pulling out these extraordinary factors, the GDP data were largely in line with prior quarters.</p></blockquote>

<p>
<blockquote><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2013/01/joe-scarborough-on-deficit.html">Joe Scarborough on the Deficit</a></p>
<p>After his interview with Paul Krugman this morning <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/paul-krugman-vs-the-world-86822.html?hp=l9">Joe Scarborough</a> wrote:</p>
<p>Mr. Krugman&#8217;s view is that Americans would be better off if its government ran deeper deficits and ignored its longterm debt.<br />To suggest that Keynesians like Paul Krugman ignore the long-term government budget constraint is either dishonest or shows that Mr. Scarborough does not understand what we are saying. Which is why Mr. Scarborough should check out <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/10-people-who-disagree-with-joe-scarborough-2013-1">this list</a> of commentary on the current economics and fiscal situation compiled by Joe Weisenthal.  </p></blockquote>
