                            <div class="content">
                                <p>About two weeks ago, Dan emailed me with a link to a New York Times article titled “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/health/religious-groups-and-employers-battle-contraception-mandate.html?emc=tnt&#038;tntemail1=y&#038;_r=1&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;">A Flood of Suits Fights Coverage of Birth Control</a>,” by Times reporter Ethan Bronner, published that day. The article began:</p>
<div dir="ltr">In a flood of lawsuits, Roman Catholics, evangelicals and Mennonites are challenging a provision in the new health care law that requires employers to cover birth control in employee health plans — a high-stakes clash between religious freedom and health care access that appears headed to the Supreme Court. </div>
<div dir="ltr">In recent months, federal courts have seen dozens of lawsuits brought not only by religious institutions like Catholic dioceses but also by private employers ranging from a pizza mogul to produce transporters who say the government is forcing them to violate core tenets of their faith. Some have been turned away by judges convinced that access to contraception is a vital health need and a compelling state interest. Others have been told that their beliefs appear to outweigh any state interest and that they may hold off complying with the law until their cases have been judged. New suits are filed nearly weekly.</div>
<p>Dan asked me if I could put the article’s contents into perspective.  I could, and I did.  I responded:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Yeah, this is part and parcel of the Liberty U.-type ACA litigation <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/11/religious-freedom-contraception-and-law.html">that we exchanged emails about back in late Nov.</a> &#8230;</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The new NYT article discusses the Hobby Lobby case, which is different than the Liberty U. case in an important respect: Hobby Lobby is a for-profit corporation, albeit a closely-held one.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The bottom line is that I expect that for-profit corporations, even small, closely-held ones like Hobby Lobby, will not be allowed an exemption from compliance with parts of the ACA on religious grounds.  The purpose of for-profit corporations is, well, profit, not the advancement of a religious cause or the practice of religion.  And corporations are people only for monetary purposes&#8211;accepting money and spending money.  At least as of now. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The two stated grounds for the corporations-are-people-too-my-friend right to First Amendment free-speech rights in Citizens United were (1) that the members of a corporation or union are united by a common political, ideological or monetary goal that is central to the existence of the nonprofit or for-profit corporation or union, and which the money&#8211;er, speech&#8211;addresses; and (2) that the general public has an interest in hearing more political speech, not less.  (At least as long as the speech is what the CEO, if not necessarily a majority of the shareholders, wants to say, and the spending balance&#8211;corporate vs. union&#8211;favors the Republican Party.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Unless Justice Kennedy &#038; Co. think more religion on the part of for-profit corporations that sell housewares and crafts is in the public interest, <a href="http://shop.hobbylobby.com/home-decor-and-framing/lamps-and-accessories/">because lamps</a>, picture frames and art supplies are people too, my friend, and because more religion by lamps, picture frames and art supplies is in the public, then Hobby Lobby probably will end up having to comply with the parts of the ACA that violate the lamps&#8217;, picture frames&#8217;, and art supplies&#8217; religious beliefs.  But, who knows? </div>
<p>I thought of that email exchange this morning after reading Bill Keller’s opinion piece about Hobby Lobby case in today’s NYT.  The title: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/opinion/keller-the-conscience-of-a-corporation.html?pagewanted=all">The Conscience of a Corporation</a>.</p>
<p>Kudos to the Times’ headline writer. </p>
<p>Hobby Lobby&#8217;s lobbyists, referenced in the title of <i>this</i> post, are, of course, the company&#8217;s lawyers.</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE: Reader J.Goodwin wrote in the Comments thread:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Hobby Lobby is relatively well-known (at least in Oklahoma) for their religious persuasion. They are closed on religious holidays and Sundays, etc.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">I don&#8217;t think that matters, but it&#8217;s not like this is a company that has never held itself off as having religious owners or religious anything.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">It&#8217;s not a straight up cash grab, it&#8217;s at least based on a history of some sort of religious values.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Obama never should have offered any exemption on this stuff. It&#8217;s time for religions to be treated like the corporations they are.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">I responded:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">One of the articles I read about the lawsuit said that Hobby Lobby reportedly treats its employees well, paying the lowest-level ones twice the minimum wage.  I had never heard of Hobby Lobby until the fall of 2011, when I was shopping in a strip mall where one was located and decided to stop in.  I didn’t even know it was a chain until last month when I read about the lawsuit, and I knew nothing at all about its owners before that.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But I do know now that it’s a closely-held corporation, the shareholders all members of one family, and that the family is genuinely religious and also apparently generous.  There’s really no question but that their position on the contraceptives insurance matter is entirely and genuinely based on their deep and longstanding religious beliefs; they are not using their beliefs as a pretext. </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But running a business is not practicing religion. And the law at issue concerns running a business, not practicing religion.  </div>
<p>That said, I didn’t intend by the title of this post to be snide or nasty, but instead to make a point. </p>

<div>Lost in the shuffle here is the question of what it is Romney is denying he&#8217;s responsible for. Stipulate that Romney somehow had nothing to do with running a company of which he was the CEO and sole shareholder. Does he think, in retrospect, that his subordinates did something wrong by offshoring jobs? Clearly he didn&#8217;t, which highlights the absurdity of his claims not to have been responsible. It&#8217;s true that he wasn&#8217;t running the country [<i>sic</i>] on a day-to-day basis, but he really was titular CEO and had Bain been doing something he deemed outrageous he could and should have stepped in to stop them. But he doesn&#8217;t believe that. And what&#8217;s more,<i> </i><em>all indications are that Barack Obama also doesn&#8217;t think Bain was doing anything wrong</em>. [Emphasis in original.] As president he&#8217;s made no moves to make it illegal for companies to shift production work abroad and has publicly associated himself with a wide range of American firms—from GE to Apple and beyond—who&#8217;ve done just that to varying extents. And we all remember what happened to Obama&#8217;s promise to renegotiate NAFTA after taking office, right?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In my view both Obama and Romney are quite right about this. I&#8217;ll say more on this during the workweek, but one quick test is do you think there&#8217;s something immoral about the fact that Toyota and BMW have manufacturing facilities located in the United States? Should the Japanese and German governments be stopping Japan- and Germany-based firms from locating production offshore?

</p>

<div></div>
<div>I posted a comment to it, saying:

<div>Well, when Obama starts claiming that one of his key qualifications for reelection is that he’s helped create jobs in China—or when Romney starts saying that Bain invested in companies that specialized in moving jobs overseas in exchange for promises by German and Japanese companies to open, or keep, factories in this country—Yglesias’s equivalency argument might be less ridiculous. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>One of Obama’s spot-on arguments against Romney’s claim that his Bain experience was a successful jobs-creation experience rather than merely a successful wealth-creation-for-investors experience is that there’s a huge difference between experience in creating wealth for private investors, by any means available and at whatever expense to others, and creating good for the country’s overall economy and general welfare.  This offshoring issue is a classic case in point. Setting aside whether the federal government has the legal authority to prohibit private companies from offshoring—and I don’t think the government has any such legal authority, except in certain limited national security or foreign policy circumstances—there’s an obvious critical difference between not trying to stop this country’s companies from offshoring, for fear of retribution by other countries’ companies, similar to trying to avoid a tariff war, and aggressively aiding offshoring by American companies irrespective of any up-side for the general American economy.

<div>Add to that that, as several other commenters have pointed out, the German and Japanese companies that offshore in this country do so mainly in manufacturing products or parts for products that will be sold in North America, mostly in this country.  GM, Ford, Chrysler and some U.S. auto-components manufacturing companies have factories in Europe, but the products and components made there are sold in Europe.  Like the German and Japanese auto companies that Yglesias equates with Bain’s offshoring-specialist companies, the American auto-industry companies continue to make the parts and cars sold in their home country in factories in their home country. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which, of course, would not be the case any longer had the Bush and Obama administrations taken Romney’s advice and let Detroit fail.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That said—and for the same reasons—Yglesias is wrong in saying that unless Romney thinks there’s something wrong with offshoring, it’s absurd for him to deny responsibility for Bain’s investments in offshoring-specialist companies during the three-year period beginning in early 1999.  If in fact Romney was no longer associated with Bain during that period, he would have every right to correct the record, whether or not he thinks there was anything wrong with what Bain did during that time.  But the question of whether Bain did anything wrong in investing in offshoring-specialist companies—during the period between 1993 and 1999, when (at least as I understand it) it apparently was doing so at Romney’s clear behest, or during the following three years—depends on what is meant by “wrong.” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It was not illegal.  But many voters think that, while it clearly was helpful to Bain’s investors and to Romney (who has continued since then to receive large payments from Bain), it was not helpful to the larger American economy and to the middle class.  It did not create jobs in this country; instead, it eliminated them.  And Romney is running for president virtually entirely on his claimed credential of being a jobs creator and of knowing how to create jobs—in America.

<div>I’m <a href="http://www.destinyland.org/when_she_was_good.htm">hesitant to be too critical of Yglesias</a> for his rather obvious conflations here.  He was, after all, not just the first pundit but also one of the very few even yet to point out a stunning, absolutely <i>jaw-dropping</i>proposition of law stated by <i>four of the nine</i> Supreme Court justices in their joint dissent late last month in the Affordable Care Act case, the part of the dissent concerning the issue of the severability of the part of the Medicaid provision in the Act that the Court’s majority struck down, in which the dissenters, while claiming that the majority was rewriting the Medicaid provision in order to save much of it, wanted to rewrite, rather dramatically, the Constitution’s separation of powers between Congress and the Court. Only four hours after the release of the opinion, when almost no one except the journalists covering the Court had yet read the dissent, Yglesias <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/06/28/why_the_dissenters_thought_dentist_deregulation_was_unconstitutional.html">wrote</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As I&#8217;ve noticed previously, there&#8217;s lots of other stuff in the Affordable Care Act besides the new regulation of insurance companies, including a move to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/06/26/the_affordable_care_act_vs_the_dentists_cartel.html">deregulate dental services</a>. So I was curious to see why the dissenters in the Supreme Court thought that not only was the individual mandate and the provisions related to the individual mandate unconstitutional, but also all this other stuff.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The answer is that they appear to have made up a new Christmas Tree Doctrine under which legitimate acts of Congress are held null and void if Antonin Scalia thinks they were part of some kind of unseemly horse-trading:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Some provisions, such as requiring chain restaurants to display nutritional content, appear likely to operate as Congress intended, but they fail the second test for severability. There is no reason to believe that Congress would have enacted them independently. The Court has not previously had occasion to consider severability in the context of an omnibus enactment like the ACA, which includes not only many provisions that are ancillary to its central provisions but also many that are entirely unrelated—hitched on because it was a quick way to get them passed despite opposition, or because their proponents could exact their enactment as the quid pro quo for their needed support. When we are confronted with such a so called “Christmas tree,” a law to which many nongermane ornaments have been attached, we think the proper rule must be that when the tree no longer exists the ornaments are superfluous. We have no reliable basis for knowing which pieces of the Act would have passed on their own. It is certain that many of them would not have, and it is not a proper function of this Court to guess which.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That all seems fine except I would have thought it was the prelude to the <i>opposite</i> ruling. It&#8217;s not the proper function of the court to guess why different provisions were enacted, just to rule on the constitutionality of laws. Since there&#8217;s plainly no constitutional problem with regulating interstate chain restaurants, the law is the law until Congress repeals the law. Instead, Justices Scalia, Alito, Kennedy, and Thomas have decided that rather than pick and choose it would be better to strike everything.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>This is far, far more newsworthy than the teensy bit of attention it has received suggests.  Four Supreme Court justices think legislative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling">logrolling</a> is improper and that therefore the Court can strike down full pieces of legislation that a majority of justices don’t like whenever they decide that some provision, however small, in the full piece of legislation is unconstitutional.  After all, y’know, maybe the rest of the legislation would not have been enacted without the <i>quid pro quo</i> votes.  Presumably, this also would apply to state laws as well as to federal laws—but, of course, as with federal laws, only to laws that the conservatives don’t like.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<p>I’d been meaning to write about this truly radical part of the dissent in the ACA case, but hadn’t gotten around to it.  Now I have.</p>

<div>The second biggest surprise of the day, after the survival of the Affordable Care Act, is that we’ve never really gotten over our collective crush on John Roberts. How else to explain today’s outpouring of praise, not merely for the decision but for the man himself, for his statesmanship and judicial modesty? All these years, it now appears, we’ve held it in our hearts; we’ve written it in our diaries, remembering every one of those sweet nothings he once whispered about “common ground” and “humility.” No, we never really gave up on Roberts. Not during that long judicial bender he took with the boys—Nino, Clarence, Tony, and Sam; not during the <em>Citizens United</em> argument, when he called the government “big brother”; not when he swept away a century’s worth of campaign finance regulations. So complete is our swoon, in the afterglow of the ACA ruling, that <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/28/obamacare-supreme-court-ruling-john-roberts-changes-his-legacy.html" target="_blank">Bob Shrum has written</a> that if Roberts had been Chief Justice in 2000, <em>Bush v. Gore</em> might have gone the other way.

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>To which I posted the following comment:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I write on legal and political issue issues for a left-of-center blog and have indicated there that I detest and really fear John Roberts because of his deeply diabolical nature and his checklist of ‘80s-era Federalist Society things-to-do.   Linda Greenhouse has written several columns, two or three of them within the last few months, highlighting those two quintessential John Roberts traits.  But Greenhouse, and I, predicted that Roberts would save the ACA because the case is so high-profile and the grounds for striking down the statute so utterly artificial that it would place more public scrutiny on the types of things he and his cadre normally get away with with virtually no public awareness.  I don’t think he did what he did out of a sense of statesmanship, nor in order to gut the Commerce Clause; I think the Commerce Clause ruling will have almost no practical effect, and he could have done the same thing with it simply by joining the other four conservatives in a 5-4 ruling striking down the ACA. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I think he’s, in a way, the mirror image of Elena Kagan, who in high-profile cases usually votes liberal but who, best as I can tell, almost never goes out on a limb for the “nobody” “cert” petitioner and actually fights to get a “cert grant,” as Sotomayor does, and who I’d bet doesn’t even vote very often to hear such cases.  Her priorities seem to be her own public image and being buddies with the “in” crowd on the Court, whereas Roberts’ priority is making as many dramatic changes to the law as he can, but doing so as much under the public’s radar as possible.  (I also think Kagan is a bit naïve on some issues because of her unfamiliarity with them—see, e.g.: federal habeas review of state-court convictions—and fairly easily snowed.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So I agree with Ken Houghton in his post below that John Roberts is not the friend of progressives.  I disagree with Ken, though, that Roberts has set up some trap through which he will later orchestrate the striking down of the ACA as a violation of equal protection because of the way in which the Medicaid expansion is administered (if I understand Ken correctly) is nil.  Roberts ended his opinion with a statement saying that the proper manner in which to determine the ultimate fate of the ACA is through the political process, not the judicial process—and I think he means it.  There are two parts of Roberts’ opinion—the part concerning Congress’s regulatory powers under the Commerce Clause and the part concerning Congress’s power to enact federal-state partnership legislation <i>a la </i>Medicaid—that raise serious concerns about the impact on <i>other</i>legislation.  I wrote separate posts yesterday about each of these, and I’ll be writing another one on Medicaid issue later today. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But any lawsuits concerning some aspect of how the law is working in practice, once it gets underway, would result in the possible tweaking of an HHS regulation or in the manner in which a particular state is implementing the Act, but I just don’t foresee a successful attack on the constitutionality of some provision in the Act itself.

<div>The chief justice, echoing Justice Scalia&#8217;s &#8220;broccoli&#8221; comment at the oral argument, rejected (as did the four dissenters, and so that is now the view of a majority of the justices) the Commerce Clause ground for the mandate, saying that to accept that ground would mean that &#8220;Congress could address the diet problem by ordering everyone to buy vegetables.&#8221; This argument, reassuring though it is to our obese population, confuses separate constitutional provisions. The Commerce Clause would empower Congress to order everyone to buy vegetables, because the market for most vegetables is interstate, but the &#8220;liberty&#8221; protected against the federal government by the Fifth Amendment would doubtless be interpreted to forbid such an imposition, just as it would be interpreted to forbid a federal law requiring everyone to be in bed with the lights out by 10 p.m. in order to economize on the use of electricity and, by doing so, reduce carbon emissions from electrical generating plants.

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’m with the others.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I think that as a practical matter, this will have almost no limiting effect at all on Congress’s regulatory powers.  I can’t think of any circumstance in which this limitation would apply and in which there would be no other enumerated power under which Congress could enact the law.  In this case, the other enumerated power is the taxing power.  In the case of, say, the Selective Service Act, the enumerated power is the power to provide for the national defense.  Etc.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The reason that this limitation is insignificant is that the Commerce Clause argument was really a disguised Fifth Amendment due process (liberty! broccoli!) argument, and Roberts flatly rejected that.  He said, no, the Commerce power doesn’t allow this but the taxing power does—and, no, it doesn’t violate fundamental constitutional concepts of freedom, of liberty!  There may be other things that could be compelled under the taxing power—broccoli purchases, maybe—that would violate Fifth Amendment due process concepts (freedom! liberty!) and thus be unconstitutional on that basis, just as there are things that could be compelled under the Commerce power that would violate that concept of due process and thus be unconstitutional on that basis.  But this does not violate that concept of due process (freedom! liberty!). 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>No, Roberts didn’t specifically separate the two concepts—Commerce Clause limitations and Fifth Amendment due process—and, yes, he does almost seem to conflate them the language Scocca quotes.  But the bottom line is that he found no due process (freedom! liberty!) problem with the mandate and penalty, and therefore no slippery slope to broccoli in this instance, even though he says the Commerce power isn’t broad enough to authorize the statute.  
</p>

                                <p>
<div>I think there was a clue to Roberts’ thinking during the first day of argument—during the argument on the applicability of the Anti-Injunction Act, an obscure “jurisdictional” statute, which precludes courts from ruling on the constitutionality of a federal tax until after the statute becomes effective and the tax actually is due.  Roberts really indicated during that argument that he was interested in finding a way to rule that the penalty was a tax for purposes of Congress’s taxing power but not a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.  That would remove the issue of whether the mandate was within Congress’s Commerce power, since if it is a tax, the mandate and penalty/tax are within Congress’s taxing power.  And then the only issue would be whether this violated the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause (liberty! broccoli!).
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Late in the argument on the mandate issue the next day, under questioning by Sotomayor, the challengers’ lawyer, Paul Clement, conceded that under its taxing power, Congress could do pretty much the same thing as it did under what Congress thought its Commerce power allowed it to do.  That effectively killed the due process (liberty! broccoli!) argument, since for purposes of that argument, it made no difference which Congress’s powers authorized it to enact the mandate and the related penalty.

<div>While the Court’s upholding the mandate is deservedly taking front stage in the media coverage, the Court’s decision to strike down a part of the Medicaid expansion may ultimately have broader jurisdprudential consequence.  That, at least, will be a subject of debate among lawyers and academics in the days and weeks to come.  This is the first time (as far as I know) that the Court has actually found a Spending Clause condition unconstitutionally coercive.  Whether it establishes principles that make many other programs vulnerable is a question that will require further analysis and debate.  Lyle Dennisten will start that analysis in an post later today or tomorrow morning.

<div>I one of the many updates to my initial post this morning, mentioned this exchange between Lyle Denniston and Tom Goldstein (SCOTUSblog’s publisher:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lyle: The rejection of the Commerce Clause and Nec. and Proper Clause should be understood as a major blow to Congress&#8217;s authority to pass social welfare laws. Using the tax code &#8212; especially in the current political environment &#8212; to promote social welfare is going to be a very chancy proposition.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tom: I dissent from Lyle&#8217;s view that the Commerce Clause ruling is a major blow to social welfare legislation. I think that piece of the decision will be read pretty narrowly.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div> I wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div>I’m almost always in agreement with Lyle’s analyses (as is, I’m sure, Tom Goldstein, who is the blog’s publisher and also a major Supreme Court litigator; Amy Howe, also a lawyer, is Goldstein’s wife).  But, like Goldstein, I disagree with Lyle on this one.  In order for the Court to interpret this opinion as limiting Congress’s authority to enact social welfare legislation, the Court would have to place in question a slew of current, longstanding social welfare programs.  I don’t think that was Roberts’ intent—really, I don’t—and I don’t think the opinion will be viewed that way.  Unless, of course, Romney wins and appoints a wingnut to replace, say, Ginsburg if her health does not hold out.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<div>Here’s what I think will happen: </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>But first, I need to point out that Medicaid, unlike Social Security and Medicare, are programs structured as partnerships between the respective states and the federal government, each paying some portion of the cost, and that Medicaid has always contained a provision that makes state participation voluntary and that allows states to remove themselves from the program if they want to.  Social Security and Medicare, by contrast, are solely federally-funded and federally-run programs. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The 26 states that challenged the ACA’s Medicaid provision argued that a provision in the Medicaid section of the ACA allows the federal government to withdraw all federal funds for a state’s entire Medicaid program—that is, the money it already is receiving—if a state opts out of the Medicaid-expansion part of the ACA.  The states argued that this was too coercive and therefore violates principles of state sovereignty.  Seven justices—the four dissenters, Roberts, Breyer and Kagan—agreed with that claim, and so they ruled that, while the federal government can put conditions on its funding of the new expansion, and can withdraw the money for that expansion if a state doesn’t comply with the conditions, the federal government <i>can’t</i>withdraw funding also for the earlier parts of Medicaid that the state already was receiving.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sooo …. this ruling certainly (in my opinion) appears to have no effect whatsoever on any program funded entirely through, and administered by, the federal government.  And i tappears to have no effect on any social welfare program that is a partnership between states and the federal government as long as there is no threat by the federal government to withdraw funds already being given to the state for something else, in order to get the state to agree to participate in the new partnership, or in the new part of the part of the partnership.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I just don’t see how this restricts in any significant way Congress’s ability to enact social welfare programs.  I think that ruling is really very narrow.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As an aside, I want to mention the four dissents who wanted to strike down the entire ACA tried to at least persuade Roberts that the entire Medicaid-expansion part of the statute simply because that one provision in that part of the Act was ruled unconstitutional—even though, as Roberts points out, the Act includes what’s known as a “severability” provision providing that if any particular section of the Act is ruled unconstitutional, the section should be severed from the remainder of the statute, and the remainder should remain in force.  This let’s-see-if-we-can-get-the-tail-to-wag-the-dog-and-win-on-this-part-at-least tack of the minority was so transparently inappropriate that Roberts, in responding to it in his opinion, seems downright offended by it.  Good for him.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>UPDATE: From SCOTUSblog: &#8220;The bottom line: the entire ACA is upheld, with the exception that the federal government&#8217;s power to terminate states&#8217; Medicaid funds is narrowly read.&#8221;</p>
<p>TOTAL, TOTAL VICTORY   !!!!
<div></div>
<div>SECOND UPDATE: The opinion is 5-4, with Roberts voting with the Dem appointees and writing the opinion, and Kennedy writing the main dissent.
</p>
</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>Here’s more from SCOTUSblog:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The money quote from the section on the mandate: Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in Section 5000A under the taxing power, and that Section 5000A need not be read to do more than impose a tax. This is sufficient to sustain it.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The court reinforces that individuals can simply refuse to pay the tax and not comply with the mandate.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the ACA to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that states accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use. What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.&#8221; (p. 55)</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>And (added after second update was posted):
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Another way to think about Medicaid: the Constitution requires that states have a choice about whether to participate in the expansion of eligibility; if they decide not to, they can continue to receive funds for the rest of the program.</div>
<p>The most talked-about part surely will be “individuals can simply refuse to pay the tax and not comply with the mandate” part.  Is it really a mandate at all if there’s no penalty for refusal to comply?  So maybe it&#8217;s not a total victory, after all.  But it&#8217;s still a big, big victory.  
</p>
<p>(The Medicaid part of the ruling has no effect on the breadth or implementation of the law at all.)</p>
<div>THIRD UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Correction from SCOTUSblog (and HT to buffpilot in the comment to my post):
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apologies &#8211; you can&#8217;t refuse to pay the tax; typo. The only effect of not complying with the mandate is that you pay the tax.  </p>
<p>Looks like everything revolves on it being a tax.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ah-hah!! It IS a TOTAL, TOTAL victory.  !!!</p>
<div>FOURTH UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Again from SCOTUSblog:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In Plain English: The Affordable Care Act, including its individual mandate that virtually all Americans buy health insurance, is constitutional. There were not five votes to uphold it on the ground that Congress could use its power to regulate commerce between the states to require everyone to buy health insurance. However, five Justices agreed that the penalty that someone must pay if he refuses to buy insurance is a kind of tax that Congress can impose using its taxing power. That is all that matters. Because the mandate survives, the Court did not need to decide what other parts of the statute were constitutional, except for a provision that required states to comply with new eligibility requirements for Medicaid or risk losing their funding. On that question, the Court held that the provision is constitutional as long as states would only lose new funds if they didn&#8217;t comply with the new requirements, rather than all of their funding.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>Yup. Total, total victory.  </p>
</p>
<p>
<div>FIFTH UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>From SCOTUSblog:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Court holds that the mandate violates the Commerce Clause, but that doesn&#8217;t matter b/c there are five votes for the mandate to be constitutional under the taxing power.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, kudos, to … um … me.  I called it pretty nearly spot-on.  I began to sort of wonder in the last few days whether in fact I really was onto something, because my post from June 15 laying that out (again) kept getting more and more “hits” as the days went by.  Usually my posts stop getting “hits” a few days after I post them.  I actually began (almost) thinking it was possible that a few people from within the Court itself—i.e., law clerks to the justices—were clicking the post after possibly being told of it by someone who reads, maybe, Business Insider.  If so, that would seem to indicate that I actually had called it right.  But I dared not <i>really</i> think that Supreme Court law clerks were reading my post.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Btw, in a comment to a blog conversation on Slate on Monday, I wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hmm.  Well, having gone out on a limb 10 days ago on a blog I write for, posting an article that discusses as one of the more likely possible healthcare-case results the tax-law outcome that Savage suggests in his LA Times article today, I’m feeling ever-so-slightly less lonely out on that tree branch.  At least now I’ll have someone to cling to on Thursday as the limb falls to the ground. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The blog conversation is ongoing there.  The current latest entry (from last night) is <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2012/_supreme_court_year_in_review/supreme_court_year_in_review_who_lost_obamacare_the_leading_suspects_are_the_solicitor_general_the_white_house_liberal_law_professors_and_five_supreme_court_justices_.html">here</a>, should any AB readers be interested. </div>
</div>
<div>SIXTH UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div>Salvaging the idea that Congress did have the power to try to expand health care to virtually all Americans, the Supreme Court on Monday upheld the constitutionality of the crucial – and most controversial — feature of the Affordable Care Act.   By a vote of 5-4, however, the Court did not sustain it as a command for Americans to buy insurance, but as a tax if they don’t.  That is the way Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., was willing to vote for it, and his view prevailed.  The other Justices split 4-4, with four wanting to uphold it as a mandate, and four opposed to it in any form.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Since President Obama signed the new law, it has been understood by almost everyone that the expansion of health care coverage to tens of millions of Americans without it could work — economically — only if the health insurance companies were guaranteed a large pool of customers.   The mandate to buy health insurance by 2014 was the method Congress chose to supply that pool.   It is not immediately clear whether the Court’s approach will produce as large a pool of new customers.   The ACA’s key provision now amounts to an invitation to buy insurance, rather than an order to do so, with a not-very-big tax penalty for going without.
</p>

</div>
<div></div>
<div>Those are the first two paragraphs of Lyle’s (I love him, and can refer to him by his first name if I want to) three-paragraph initial article on the regular blog (as opposed to the live blog).  He’s sure to post updates to the article later today.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Earlier, on the live blog, Amy Howe wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Take a quick look at Footnote 11, which is on page 44 of the slip opinion: Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully forgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance and pay lower taxes. The only thing that they may not lawfully do is not buy health insurance and not pay the resulting tax.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And for those of you who remember my writing about an obscure court-jurisdiction statute called the Anti-Injunction Act, which was a subject of controversy in the case, Lyle, writing earlier on the live blog, wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Interesting, at least to scholars, that while the mandate and its attached penalty are a tax for purposes of its constitutionality, but not for the Anti-Injunction Act. If it were a tax for AIA purposes, this case would not have been decided re the mandate.

<div></div>
<div>I’m almost always in agreement with Lyle’s analyses (as is, I’m sure, Tom Goldstein, who is the blog’s publisher and also a major Supreme Court litigator; Amy Howe, also a lawyer, is Goldstein’s wife).  But, like Goldstein, I disagree with Lyle on this one.  In order for the Court to interpret this opinion as limiting Congress’s authority to enact social welfare legislation, the Court would have to place in question a slew of current, longstanding social welfare programs.  I don’t think that was Roberts’ intent—really, I don’t—and I don’t think the opinion will be viewed that way.  Unless, of course, Romney wins and appoints a wingnut to replace, say, Ginsburg if her health does not hold out.  
</p>
</div>
<div>SEVENTH (Yikes!) UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This one’s not from SCOTUSblog.  It’s from Ginsburg’s concurrence, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>At bottom, THE  CHIEF  JUSTICE’s and the joint dissenters’ “view that an individual cannot be subject to Commerce Clause regulation absent voluntary, affirmative acts that enter him or her into, or affect, the interstate market expresses a concern for individual liberty that [is] more redolent of Due Process Clause arguments.”  SevenSky, 661 F. 3d, at 19.  See also  Troxel v.  Granville, 530 U. S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality opinion) (“The [Due Process] Clause also includes a substantive component that provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Plaintiffs have abandoned any argument pinned to substantive due process, however, see 648 F. 3d 1235, 1291, n. 93 (CA11 2011), and now concede that the provisions here at issue do not offend the Due Process Clause.8
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Footnote 8 says:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>8. Some adherents to the joint dissent have questioned the existence of substantive due process rights.  See McDonald v.  Chicago, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 7) (The notion that the Due Process Clause “could define the substance of th[e] righ[t to liberty] strains credulity.”); Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 275 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“I reject the proposition that the Due Process Clause guarantees certain (unspecified) liberties[.]”).  Given these Justices’ reluctance to interpret the Due Process Clause as guaranteeing liberty interests, their willingness to plant such protections in the Commerce Clause is striking.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The <i>SevenSky</i> opinion, <i>SevenSky v. Holder</i>, that Ginsburg quotes from was written last November by Lawrence Silberman, a Reagan appointee to the federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and one of the most respected (in conservative legal circles) federal appellate judges, in one of the ACA cases. As for Ginsburg’s footnote 8, she says something I’ve wondered about all along: Substantive due process is legal doctrine under which <i>Roe v. Wade</i>and, before that, the opinion striking down  a Connecticut law that prohibited the sale and use of contraceptives, were based.  <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i>, the 2003 Kennedy opinion invalidating Texas’s sodomy statute also was based on that doctrine.  Thomas and Scalia routinely lambaste the doctrine, as do many other tea partier folks. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So the question is: Do these people now concede the appropriateness of the legal doctrine underlying those cases they hate so much?
</p>

<div>The Court will announce its healthcare ruling on Thursday.  Tom Goldstein, founder of Scotusblog, said after this morning’s opinions were issued that, in light of the Court’s informal division-of-labor routine, and based on which justice wrote which of today’s majority opinions, it looks pretty clear that (as everyone has been predicting all along) Roberts will write the majority opinion in the healthcare case, possibly (Goldstein said) with assistance from Kennedy.  In other words, it’s likely that Roberts will write the part of the majority opinion that addresses the individual mandate and related penalty and that Kennedy may write the majority opinion on at least one of the other three issues in the case. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Interestingly, at least to me, veteran LA Times Supreme Court correspondent David Savage has <a href="http://www.latimes.com/health/la-na-court-final-20120625,0,1925650.story">an article</a> today in which he offers the possibility that—er—<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/06/linda-greenhouses-aca-litigation.html">I’m right</a>.  Here’s the relevant excerpt from Savage&#8217;s article:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The healthcare case has been fiercely debated as a test of whether Congress can require individuals to buy health insurance under its power to regulate commerce. Opponents have likened it to forcing Americans to buy <a href="http://www.latimes.com/topic/health/diets-dieting/healthy-diet-HEDI000014.topic" title="Healthy Diet">healthy food</a>, such as vegetables.</p>
<p>Lurking in the background is a way to decide the case on tax law grounds. No one can be prosecuted, punished or fined for violating the mandate. In fact, the word &#8220;mandate&#8221; does not appear in the law. In &#8220;practical operation,&#8221; the administration argued, it&#8217;s just a tax law.</p>
<p>If the mandate is really just a tax, that would be supported by the Constitution, which says Congress &#8220;shall have the power to lay and collect taxes … to provide for the common defense and general welfare.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, in the end, the justices could agree the law&#8217;s required tax payments are constitutional, while also making clear the government does not have broad power to mandate purchases.</p>
<p>Late last year, Judge Brett Kavanaugh of the U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington, an influential appointee of President <a href="http://www.latimes.com/topic/politics/government/presidents-of-the-united-states/george-bush-PEPLT000857.topic" title="George Bush">George W. Bush</a> and a friend of the chief justice, wrote an opinion arguing for treating the mandate as a tax law, not a regulation of commerce.</p>
<p>During oral arguments in March, the conservative justices sounded highly skeptical of giving the government the power to mandate purchases. But at one point, liberal Justice <a href="http://www.latimes.com/topic/crime-law-justice/justice-system/sonia-sotomayor-PEPLT0000016163.topic" title="Sonia Sotomayor">Sonia Sotomayor</a>asked whether it would be constitutional for Congress to assess a tax for health insurance and include an exemption for everyone who had insurance.</p>
<p>&#8220;The government might be able to do that,&#8221; said Paul D. Clement, the lawyer for the Republican states suing to overturn the healthcare law. If so, the liberals asked, why can&#8217;t Congress require people to have private insurance or pay a tax penalty?</p>
<p>Having the law upheld on tax grounds would be a big win for the president.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>(In my June 15 post, I paraphrased Sotomayor’s question and erroneously attributed it to either Roberts or Kennedy.  I said I couldn’t remember which of the two had asked the question, which is no surprise since neither of them did.  Ah; I should have known.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now on to today’s big rulings.  The most significant—<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/25/politics/scotus-arizona-law/index.html?eref=igoogledmn_topstories">and it is huge</a>—is a <i>big</i> surprise.  In a 5-3 opinion (Kagan did not participate) written by Kennedy and joined by Roberts in <i>Arizona v.</i> <i>United States</i>, the Court struck down on “federal preemption” grounds almost all of the major provisions in Arizona’s stop/demand-citizenship-papers/detain-upon-suspicion-of-being-an-illegal-alien all Hispanic-looking-or-sounding-folks law.  “Federal preemption” is a legal doctrine, based on the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause, that bars states from enacting laws that conflict with a federal statute or that intrude into a policy area in which the Constitution grants the federal government sole control (e.g., national defense and foreign policy) or in which a federal statute indicates Congress’s intent to make federal statute the sole arbiter in that area of policy. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>On the only remaining major provision—which appears to allow the detention by state prison officials of anyone arrested on other grounds, in order to allow the officials to verify the person’s citizenship—the Court rule that it is too early to know whether or not federal law preempts that provision, because the state courts have not yet “interpreted” it.  The opinion makes clear, though, that if the state court interprets the provision to permit a detention or an extension of a detention in order to enable the citizenship check, this provision, too, likely would be preempted.  And the opinion says explicitly that even if the state court interprets the provision narrowly enough to survive preemption on the grounds argued in this case, the provision may be preempted on other grounds or it may violate another provision of the Constitution.  In a separate lawsuit, the law is being challenged on Fourteenth Amendment equal protection (racial profiling) and due process grounds.</p>
<p>UPDATE: <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/06/online-symposium-s-b-1070-rides-off-into-the-sunset/">Here&#8217;s</a> an outstanding discussion of the Arizona-statute opinion at Scotusblog.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>The other major ruling today in a fully briefed and argued case—two cases, actually; one from Alabama, the other from Arkansas—extended the Eight Amendment’s bar to cruel and unusual punishment to strike down as unconstitutional state statutes that mandate life imprisonment without possibility of parole when the statute is applied to minors.  This was a 5-4 opinion written by Kagan and joined by Kennedy.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the final ruling of broad significance, the Fab Five summarily reversed (i.e., without full briefing and oral argument) the Montana Supreme Court in the case in which that court had upheld the constitutionality of a longstanding Montana campaign-finance statute despite <i>Citizens United</i>.  I had called this one wrong in postings on AB, saying that I thought the Court would agree to hear the case, but a week ago I realized that I probably was wrong.  The Court had initially scheduled its decision for last Monday on whether or not it would hear the case next term.  When it put off its announcement until today, I knew what that meant.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The dissent, written by Breyer and joined by the other Dem appointees, says that while they had the minimum number of votes (four) to force full briefing and oral argument, the four decided not to do so because they recognized that there was no chance that any of the other five would vote differently if the case were argued.  I think the four should have forced full argument next term, not because there was a chance that one of the five would switch sides—there was not—but because this case would have educated the public about a critical fact that most of the public probably does not know: that in <i>Citizens United</i>, the 5-4 majority didn’t hold that the First Amendment speech grounds are absolute—a ruling that would have required them to expressly overrule the Court’s longstanding election-law precedents—but instead based its ruling on a “finding” of utterly fabricated and baseless <i>fact</i>.  The 5-4 majority simply declared, based on nothing at all, that they “find” that unlimited campaign “expenditures” by outside individuals, groups and corporations does not “give rise” to corruption or to the appearance of corruption.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Had the Court been forced to have a full hearing on the Montana case, complete with oral argument, the public would have learned that in election-law cases, this 5-4 majority simply fabricates facts and casually varies the standard under which the Court can strike down a statute as unconstitutional, depending on what is required for the majority rule in a way that (significantly) helps Republican candidates.  In <i>Citizens</i><i>United</i>, for example, the majority not only decided on its own to raise the issue of the constitutionality of the campaign-expenditure limitations in the McCain-Feingold law, a tactic that violates the Court&#8217;s own procedural norms and, in that instance, its own Article III &#8220;jurisdictional&#8221; precedents;* they also required that Congress have vast, specific evidence that unlimited expenditures cause corruption or the appearance of corruption, and then denied the government the opportunity to gather and present that evidence, instead simply coopting for themselves the writing of the “facts.”  Yet, in a case a few years ago that challenged the constitutionality of a state law that required a government-issued photo ID in order to prevent voter fraud, the 5-4 majority required no evidence whatsoever by the state that widespread voter fraud existed—and ignored the evidence that such voter fraud is almost nonexistent. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In my opinion, it is this aggressive but quiet altering of procedural and standard-of-review law in cases that could affect election outcomes, in a manner that baldly favors Republican candidates either directly or indirectly, that makes this 5-4 majority so dangerous.  But for the moment, I’ll rejoice in the outcome of the two opinions in argued cases that I discussed above.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And on Thursday, we&#8217;ll learn whether Savage and I are right or whether instead almost everyone else is.</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*The part of that sentence that reads &#8220;a tactic that violates the Court&#8217;s own procedural norms and, in that instance, its own Article III &#8220;jurisdictional&#8221; precedents&#8221; was added for clarity on 6/26.</p>
