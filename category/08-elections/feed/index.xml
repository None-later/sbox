				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I check out Robert Reich&#8217;s blog on occasion being that he is a person who was involved in the past.  <a href="http://robertreich.blogspot.com/">Yesterdays:</a>
<div align="left">
<blockquote>
<div align="left">Over a decade ago when, as Secretary of Labor, I hollered about the scandal of widening inequality in America, I’d get phone calls from Democratic officials who politely asked me to shut up. After all, I was part of the administration, and my complaints made it seem as if the administration wasn’t doing nearly enough. It wasn’t. <strong>We hadn’t delivered on Bill Clinton’s 1992 election promises</strong>. An expanded Earned Income Tax Credit helped the poorest but the old working class was going nowhere.</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
<p>Well, what&#8217;d yah know? Clinton&#8217;s progressive first run rhetoric was fluff.</p>
<p>He says there are 2 thoughts in this country; trickle down and bottom up.</p>
<blockquote><p>In a global economy, investments don’t trickle down; they trickles out to wherever on the planet the rich can get the highest return. If trickle down worked as advertised inequality wouldn’t be widening so fast.</p>
<p>Bottom up means giving all Americans what they need to be productive – universal and affordable health coverage, good schools, a chance to attend college, job retraining, affordable child care, and good public transportation to and from the job, for starters. But as we learned a decade ago, this requires money – even more, now. So the question is how the nation can afford it&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Solution:<br />
<blockquote>The only way is to stop obsessing about balancing the budget and start pushing for a serious tax hike on the rich. Yet all Democratic presidential candidates are styling themselves &#8220;fiscal conservatives&#8221; and none has suggested raising the marginal tax rate on the richest beyond the 38 percent rate it was under Bill Clinton. They may talk bottom-up economics but they&#8217;re still wedded to trickle down.</p></blockquote>
<p>I think someone is feeling betrayed. So, what are the candidates talking?<br />I give you an interview by Charlie Rose of <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2007/08/06/1/economic-advisors-of-three-leading-democratic-presidential-campaigns">3 economic advisors </a>to 3 democratic candidates.<br />And, just for good measure here is an interview with<a href="http://www.frugalmarketing.com/dtb/leo-hindery.shtml"> Leo Hindrey, Mr. Edwards </a>econ adviser.</p>
<p>A teaser from the interview:<br />
<blockquote>In 1981 the Business Roundtable noted that CEOs have multiple constituencies, but in 2004 &#8211; after Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, the NYSE, etc. &#8211; that very same Business Roundtable narrowed CEO responsibility back to &#8220;shareholders only&#8221;. How wrong they are! Unless and until CEOs acknowledge obligations as well to employees, customers, communities and the nation, misbehaviours will continue &#8211; and, by the way, management is not a constituency unto itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>My favorite line from the interview (cause I&#8217;ve noted here, and implied here the same question although Walmart is just his example):<br />
<blockquote>The question Wal-Mart simply needs to ask itself is &#8220;when is enough, enough?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>What was that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/money-from-money-not-good.html">Mr Bogle </a>was saying about enough?</p>
