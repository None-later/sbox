				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/magazine/22wwln-idealab-t.html?ref=magazine">Dalton Conley</a>.</p>
<p>1. Conley actually wrote this for publication in the New York Times:<br />
<blockquote>The truth is that the triumph of conservative ideas may present a political problem for the ailing Republicans, but the party that&#8217;s truly lacking in ideas is my own, the resurgent Democrats.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, that <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2008/06/housing_and_the.html">triumph</a> <a href="http://thepoorman.net/2008/06/18/shrill-3/">of</a> <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/apr/06/3trillionmaybetoolow">conservative</a> <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/campaign_2008_/2008/06/it_would_be_a_big_advantage_to_him.php">ideas</a> is why the Republicans are in trouble.</p>
<p>2. In making the case for #1, Conley has trouble distinguishing the (vanishing) postwar corporatist &#8220;social compact&#8221; from the New Deal and Great Society programs, and figuring out that what&#8217;s &#8220;trouble&#8221; for the former is not obviously problematic for the government social insurance programs that are the hallmarks of the latter.</p>
<p>3. Conley mentions possible policy directions like government intervention to form health insurance pools and absorb other economic risks, and the &#8220;soft paternalism&#8221; movement, without noting that such things are hallmarks of Democratic policy, not Republican policy.  For instance, making the government the reinsurer of last resort was the centerpiece of John Kerry&#8217;s health care plan, and arguably the prominent advocate of &#8220;soft paternalism&#8221; is Cass Sunstein â€” a friend and informal advisor to last-time-I-checked-not-Republican Barack Obama.</p>
<p>4. Conley concludes that Democrats should &#8220;stop talking F.D.R., J.F.K. and L.B.J. and start thinking eBay, Google, and Wiki.&#8221; So the road to prosperity is paved with collaboratively advertising sales of used stuff to each other?!  <em>Great</em> program.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>NWA has <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/business/18air.html">joined the crowd</a> of domestic airlines announcing (even more) capacity reductions, and their <a href="http://www.nwa.com/corpinfo/newsc/2008/pr061720082015.html">announcement</a> contains this head-scratcher:<br />
<blockquote>As a result of the reduced capacity, Northwest is removing a combination of 14 B757s and Airbus narrowbody aircraft from the fleet.</p>
<p>In addition, the DC-9 fleet will be reduced from 94 aircraft at the start of 2008 to 61 aircraft (20 DC9-30s and 41 DC9-40s/50s) by year-end.  [Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>The DC-9s have been overdue for retirement for some time, so that part of the reduction makes sense enough.  Parking the Airbuses, not so much when there are DC-9s still to retire.  While they are a bit big compared to the DC-9-50 (to the tune of around 25 seats; the A319 is the direct substitute in terms of seating capacity), the <a href="http://www.transtats.bts.gov/Fields.asp?Table_ID=297">cost statistics</a> via NWA&#8217;s latest filings with the DOT indicate that the A320 is cheaper to fly than any DC-9 in flying operations expenses.  Significantly, fuel issuance is considerably less for the bigger and heavier A320 even versus the 105-seat DC-9-30 (937 gallons/hour vs. 1039-1215 [*]).  Plus, you know, there are more seats to sell (or offer someone an empty middle seat, remember those?).</p>
<p>Maybe there&#8217;s something about the particular planes they want to park (that isn&#8217;t also something about the ancient DC-9s)?  Otherwise, it looks like someone has their head up a fleet planning model.</p>
<p>[*] Note the decarbonization potential from replacing the relatively aged domestic airline fleet.</p>
