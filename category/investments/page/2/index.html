<ol>
<li>Mark Thoma proves he&#8217;s an economist (not just an econometrician) by <a target="_blank" href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/10/skewed-rewards-for-bankers.html">reminding everyone of the Opportunity Cost of the Oughts</a> from a long-term perspective*:<br />((Rdan&#8230;Attribution of the quote is in error due to a format error at Mark&#8217;s&#8230;the original is from Joseph Stiglitz at <a href="http://www.koreaherald.co.kr/NEWKHSITE/data/html_dir/2009/10/10/200910100026.asp">Korean Herald</a>)<br />
<blockquote>[T]he worst effects were on our human capital, our most precious resource. Absurdly generous compensation in the financial sector induced some of our best minds to go into banking. Who knows how many Borlaugs there might have been among those enticed by the riches of Wall Street and the City of London? If we lost even one, our world was made immeasurably poorer. </p></blockquote>
<p></li>
<li>Mark Cuban summarizes <a target="_blank" href="http://blogmaverick.com/2009/10/10/the-cause-of-bubbles-financial-engineering-vs-investing/">the effect of that skew in the short term</a>**:<br />
<blockquote>The beautiful thing about this country is that we like to work hard, and we like to take chances. Unfortunately, over the last 15 years, the incentives have been to take chances as a financial engineer rather than as an entrepreneur. We give far more money to people who play games with financial instruments than we give to people who come up with ideas for the next big thing.  That needs to change if we want to remain a leader in this world. [emphasis his]</p></blockquote>
<p></li>
</ol>
<p>I have quibbles, but the direction and magnitude of the two above is correct: a massive reallocation of incentives that diverted talent from potential paradigm-shifting development to incremental risk re-allocation and obfuscation.  The rest of us were just, well, marks.  *Maybe more on this one later, from another angle.  **Though he has a rather generous, imnvho, definition of an &#8220;investor.&#8221;  But even by that weak definition, his point stands.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Back in the old days of derivatives (the mid-1980s), there was an international commercial bank that was famous for declaring how much good derivatives had done for it.</p>
<p>It was famous because it was common knowledge in the marketplace that the bank would have its swap counterparties &#8220;buy out&#8221; the positions where it was due money, while those on which it had a debit debit were kept on its books.</p>
<p>So I wasn&#8217;t exactly either surprised or believing when the NYT announced, to much fanfare, that there was a &#8220;profit&#8221; being made on the bailout funds.  As <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/08/nyt-as-big-banks-repay-bailout-money-us.html">Bruce Webb noted here at the time</a>:<br />
<blockquote>These early returns are by no means a full accounting of the huge financial rescue undertaken by the federal government last year to stabilize teetering banks and other companies.</p>
<p>The government still faces potentially huge long-term losses from its bailouts of the insurance giant American International Group, the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the automakers General Motors and Chrysler. The Treasury Department could also take a hit from its guarantees on billions of dollars of toxic mortgages.</p></blockquote>
<p>But it got nice headlines at the end of August, when talk of &#8220;green shoots&#8221; and &#8220;inflation fears&#8221;needed to get momentum.</p>
<p>Featured less prominently is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-tarp25-2009sep25,0,5403668.story">a now-week-old LAT article with a more realistic perspective</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Treasury is unlikely to get back the full amount of money lent under the Troubled Asset Relief Program despite a recent spate of repayments from large banks, warned the program&#8217;s watchdog.</p>
<p>The program &#8220;played a significant role&#8221; in rescuing the financial system from a meltdown, Neil Barofsky, special inspector general for TARP, testified before the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday. But it was &#8220;extremely unlikely that the taxpayer will see a full return on its TARP investment,&#8221; according to his prepared testimony.</p></blockquote>
<p>The official story remains that the large banks will be paying everything back.  If that&#8217;s true, then the answer to Rebecca&#8217;s question of <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/10/draining-liquidity-from-banking-system.html">how to drain liquidity from the financial system</a> is clear: take the paybacks and disappear the monies.  It&#8217;s only if there is an excess shortfall on the securities that excess money will be in the system.</p>
<p>So, if the NYT was correct at the end of August, or the cheerleaders are correct now, there will not be an inflation issue, or an excess bubble, just a little &#8220;extra lubricant&#8221; making certain that valuable securities attain their full value that will naturally be removed from the system (both as cash and as Lines of Credit) as the value is realized.</p>
<p>Indeed, the only reason to fear inflation from TARP/TAF sources is if you expect a significant shortfall in the actual values, something for which you can only compensate by leaving a large quantity of excess lendings in the market.  Which, by definition, will not and cannot happen if all the major players repay their allocations in full (let alone with interest).</p>
<p>Second derivatives don&#8217;t make inflation.  And money loaned by the Fed that is fully repaid doesn&#8217;t make inflation unless it is loaned out (&#8220;multiplier effect&#8221;), which hasn&#8217;t been and still isn&#8217;t happening.</p>
<p>What there is is &#8220;excess&#8221; cash sitting on bank balance sheets in lieu of full repayments.  But it&#8217;s not being used for other things—no multiplier effect—and it can be disappeared by the Fed as it is paid back.</p>
<p>So where is the inflation, unless money has been added to the system without there being value behind it?</p>
<p>Somewhere, an old derivatives manager is watching. Maybe he recognizes his strategy in the story unfolding.  Maybe, just maybe, he also kept underlying deals that didn&#8217;t have losses as big as the gains he took.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible.  But it was never the way to bet.</p>

<p>A proposed reform (already shelved) is to require banks to offer &#8220;plain vanilla&#8221; products. I am very confused about this proposal, so this is a semi bleg. I can&#8217;t see any possible benefit from the regulation (probably because I haven&#8217;t read the fine print of the draft bill). </p>
<p><s>My thoughts after the jump.</s></p>
<p>Bottom line &#8212; a vanilla option must include the rule that at least x% of a bank&#8217;s business must be vanilla or they pay a fine to work.</p>
<p>Also, I propose calling non vanilla products &#8220;fudge swirl&#8221; products unless anyone has ever scene &#8220;fudge twist&#8221; or &#8220;fudge spin&#8221; ice cream.</p>
<p>update:  Jump corrected so most of my post is after it. <br />Also see Waldman vs Waldmann after the jump.</p>
<p>I will criticize a proposal which might exist only in my imagination. A very silly vanilla rule that just says banks must offer a plain vanilla product &#8212; say a 30 year fixed rate mortgage. [Here is an] explanation by [Steve Waldman at] Interfluidity via <a target="_blank" href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2009/09/29/vanilla-option-extra-scoop/">rortybomb</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Vanilla products would turn basic financial services into a commodity business, and force providers to compete on price…. Since vanilla financial products would be commodities, banks would have to universally collude to offer them at inflated prices in order to bilk consumers. Competing vanilla project offerings would (at least they should) vary only on a single dimension (e.g. an interest rate). Points, fees, penalties, etc. would be homogeneous or uniformly pegged to the core price.</p></blockquote>
<p>This argument does not apply to a simple requirement that banks offer vanilla products. Forcing them to offer the product does not force them to compete to sell the product. </p>
<p>Consider the case in which all banks offer fixed interest 30 year mortgages at 100% interest per year. Technically they have fulfilled the silly vanilla requirement. There is no improvement in anything as offering a fixed rate mortgage at 100% is just like not offering a fixed rate mortgage.</p>
<p>So, in the absense of collusion, is this alleged equilibrium vulnerable to deviation by a firm which offers a reasonably priced fixed rate mortgage ? It might or might not be. If it isn&#8217;t then the silly vanilla rule will not be effective. If it is, then the silly vanilla rule is not needed and will make no difference.</p>
<p>Since offering fixed rate mortgages at 100% is just like not offering them, the equilibrium profits and profits to deviators are just the same as in the case in which there are no vanilla products and one bank can deviate by introducing one.</p>
<p>If compliance with the regulation implies no real change at all, then a bad equilibrium with technical compliance will be identical to a bad equilibrium with no regulation, one is a Nash equilibrium if and only if the other is and payoffs to all agents are just the same.</p>
<p>So &#8220;forced to compete&#8221; only makes sense if the vanilla rule is not the silly vanilla rule. It makes sense if there is a requirement that say at least 10% of a bank&#8217;s mortgage lending must be fixed rate 30 year. Then banks will compete to issue fixed rate mortgages even if they are not as profitable as option ARMs etc , because by loaning a dollar at a fixed rate for 30 years they win the valuable right to loan 9 dollars as option arms. </p>
<p>I have no idea if the proposed now shelved rule was the silly vanilla rule (hence the bleg)</p>

<p>Robert,</p>
<p>I tried to add this as a comment to your Angry Bear post, but alas, I am too logorrheic. The post was rejected, and I am too lazy to edit.</p>
<p>So I offer it to you, fwiw&#8230;</p>
<p>  smiles,<br />     Steve</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Robert &#8212; I hesitate to disagree with you, because you have that extra &#8216;n&#8217; that gives you superpowers of which I can only dream.</p>
<p>But you are wrong, right here:</p>
<p>&#8220;Since offering fixed rate mortgages at 100% is just like not offering them, the equilibrium profits and profits to deviators are just the same as in the case in which there are no vanilla products and one bank can deviate by introducing one.&#8221;</p>
<p>This would be true if consumers had perfect information and could distinguish safe from unsafe products, vanilla from fudge swirl. But in a world where all financial products that banks offer are opaque to most consumers, and where therefore consumers attach an uncertainty cost based primarily on offering institution, no bank has an incentive to deviate with a less profitable vanilla product. Suppose a 30-year &#8220;fudge swirl&#8221; mortgage creates higher revenues in expectation (and higher costs to consumers) than a 30-year vanilla. But consumers cannot distinguish fudge swirl from vanilla. Then offering only fudge swirl is the dominant strategy for banks. Offering vanilla involves fixed costs of product development, and consumers that choose vanilla are just an opportunity cost viz fudge swirl.</p>
<p>Now suppose a trusted external party, call it &#8220;the government&#8221; certifies some products as vanilla. (There is no other party that could credible on this given the incentives to game certifications, and even the government might be too compromised.) Now consumers can distinguish between vanilla and fudge swirl, and deviating involves benefits as well as costs. Offering a non-100% 30 yr vanilla will capture some extra consumers, who know it is that good clean flavor they like, leading to extra revenues, while it will also cannibalize some existing, more profitable nonvanilla prospects. Under this circumstance, there should be deviation, as the sole provider of vanilla (under reasonable assumptions) would gain much more by taking other firms&#8217; prospects than they&#8217;d lose downselling their own client base.</p>
<p>This argument suggests that there&#8217;s no reason to require any bank to offer vanilla, just a requirement to have the government certify some products as vanilla. And I think that&#8217;s mostly right, although I support a requirement for the sake of timing, because it can take a while for existing well-policed cartels to collapse despite a favorable Nash equilibrium. That is, if CFPA simply defined a schedule of vanilla financial products and offered to certify compliant offerings, the larger banks would &#8220;as a matter of principle&#8221; refuse to participate, and many smaller banks as well by virtue of industry/ABA pressure. The industry would also lobby for very elaborate certification requirements for vanilla products, and that banks should pay their own certification costs, to create a barriers that would help to discourage smaller deviators. Still, if the certification barriers aren&#8217;t too outlandish, some small and midsize banks would deviate. Since financial product markets are segmented (there are many customers who for arguably misguidedly perceive larger providers as safer or more reliable), big banks wouldn&#8217;t be under very much pressure to follow suit and compete. Eventually, again if certifiation costs aren&#8217;t outlandish, the cartel would break, and fundamentally, mere credible certification of vanillahood would be sufficient over the long run. But over the long run we&#8217;re dead. I support vanilla as a requirement because I want to see informationally-protected financial services rents collapse quickly, not &#8220;at equilibrium&#8221;.</p>
<p>Note that the market that would be least affected by vanilla products is mortgages, because a de-facto vanilla standard already exists &#8212; GSE requirements for prime mortgages. Here we can see that&#8230;</p>
<p>1) vanilla is not a panacea &#8212; there has long existed a widely known vanilla product, yet banks often persuaded prime-eligible consumers to accept products with much higher expected costs by offering attractive features like teaser rates and negative amortizations. People can still choose belly-ache when vanilla is on offer, and they will.</p>
<p>2) vanilla is not useless. Many homebuyers, understanding that mortgages are a complex game they are ill-equipped to play, forgo lower down- and monthly payments to stick with &#8220;traditional prime&#8221; mortgages. Vanilla has worked exactly as it is supposed to for this population: homebuyers can shop around for a prime mortgage based on fees, perceived service, convenience, etc, and the market is competitive. Not all providers are the same, of course, but people are rarely screwed by surprising characteristics of the product. Lots of primes are defaulting of course, but they are doing so for reasons they would have understood well ex ante: they can&#8217;t make the monthly payment, even though it is the same payment they signed up to and paid their first month. They are not being screwed by prepayment penalties, resets, recasts, interest-rate spikes, etc. That primes are suffering in the quantity that they are is arguably a function of the popularity of nonprime products, which permitted higher effective leverage and therefore helped inflate a housing market primes had to compete in. (If all homebuyers had to put 20% down per supervanilla prime, there would have been no housing bubble.)</p>
<p>Anyway, my understand is that the vanilla rule would have been what you are calling the &#8220;silly vanilla rule&#8221;. But you are wrong to do so. Such a rule would not be silly at all.</p>

I see you John Lemprière, hissed from each mouth. Erichthonius. Curling and unfurling like snakes. Like flames.  Just flames. Flames in a stove in a room. A room between Minerva’s shrine and Vulcan’s forge.</p>

                                <p>Ken Houghton notes that the first thing anyone learns from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Travels-T-Shirt-Global-Economy-Economist/dp/0470287160/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1251736322&#038;sr=1-1">Pietra Rivoli&#8217;s <em>The Travels of a T-Shirt in the Global Economy: An Economist Examines the Markets, Power, and Politics of World Trade</em></a> is how pernicious the U.S. subsidy of its cotton industry is.*  Now the WTO has <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/01/business/global/01cotton.html?src=linkedin&#038;pagewanted=print">discovered the obvious</a>:<br />
<blockquote>American goods will face [$294.7] million in annual sanctions as a result of the United States’ failure to eliminate illegal subsidies to domestic cotton growers, the World Trade Organization ruled Monday.</p></blockquote>
<p>The NYT attempts to spin this as a loss for the complainants:<br />
<blockquote>The result was disappointing for Brazil, which has won a series of rulings against the United States over the last seven years. The Latin American country had sought to target American goods and drug patents for $2.5 billion worth of economic retaliation.</p></blockquote>
<p>But gets to the order-of-magnitude-other-way-part a few paragraphs later:<br />
<blockquote>Washington had argued that the award should not exceed $30 million. </p></blockquote>
<p>So no one is happy, but it&#8217;s a start:<br />
<blockquote>“The subsidies paid by the United States to its 25,000 cotton farmers exceed the entire gross national income of virtually every cotton-exporting country in West and Central Africa,” Mr. McGivern said. “Despite several rounds of litigation and ministerial-level negotiations, this issue remains unresolved.”</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The cotton case was the first agricultural case started by a developing country in the group’s history.</p></blockquote>
<p>The issue of generic drugs and trade is dealt with in <a target="_blank" href="http://healthaffairs.org/blog/2009/08/28/trade-rules-limit-availability-of-generics/">this <em>Health Affairs</em> piece</a> (of which maybe more later).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, those interested in a certain absurd claim previous dealt with by Susan of Texas (see <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/08/innovation.html">here</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/2009/08/mcardle-admits-her-anti-health-care.html">here</a>, for instance) and <a target="_blank" href="http://firemeganmcardle.blogspot.com/2009/08/about-wapo-chat.html">others</a>, check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.healthaffairs.org/press/julaug0912.htm">this press release from <em>Health Affairs</em> from last week</a>.  Good thing those countries don&#8217;t have a system that supports pharmaceutical innovation and investment better than the U.S. one.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Ken Houghton remembers that Warren Buffett famously groused that he pays a lower percentage of his income in taxes than his secretary.  Or the person who will come up with an actual cure for a cancer.</p>
<p>Mark Cuban takes this one step further, <a target="_blank" href="http://blogmaverick.com/2009/08/18/some-thoughts-on-the-economy/">pointing out the obvious</a>: if we want to promote investment, &#8220;we should tax the trader/speculator more heavily than the investor.[emphasis his]&#8221;</p>
<p>When you make the tax rate the same for short-term investment as long-term—and lower than that on income—you create the perverse incentive to taking profits in the short-term, making the &#8220;capital&#8221; investment equivalent to a Demand Deposit account.  If you want to reward capital investment, it needs to be truly treated as capital. Cuban notes:<br />
<blockquote>The government should raises taxes significantly on profits from short term capital gains on the sale of public stocks, indexes, commodities, futures held for 24 hours or less and extend the length of time required to qualify for Long Term capital gains and reduce the tax rate on Long Term gains.</p></blockquote>
<p>It might be difficult to reduce the already-less-than-minimal tax rate on long-term gains. (Last time I checked, the capital gain on a five-year investment is taxed at 8%.) But it would be no problem at all raising the rate on short-term trades back to where it should be—above that of ordinary income tax rates.  And even a budget-balancing approach would leave plenty of room to lower the rate for legitimately long-term holdings.</p>
<p>Cuban makes the connection: one of the reasons the tax incentives need to be moved is the perversion they have made of Corporate Governance:<br />
<blockquote>[Raising taxes on short-term trades and lowering them on long-term investments] will also reward companies that act in the financial interests of long term holders and their employers. I think the impact on the economy would be far fewer layoffs as CEOs find themselves with more shareholders who think long term rather than short term. Believe it or not, there are shareholders who are fine with companies not beating their numbers if the company is making progress towards a clearly defined goal&#8230;.Taxation can change the focus on public companies and stock trading. That would be a great thing for the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cuban notes that there is still the major problem of misaligned incentives in Executive Compensation (economist&#8217;s version <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w15165">here</a> [PDF, subscription required]):<br />
<blockquote>CEOs&#8230;are so focused on marking to market their own personal stock portfolios, they emphasize stock performance over doing the right thing for the company.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazingly, this is exactly the problem that standard economic theory claims &#8220;professional&#8221; management solved.  I hope this one makes it into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;as_q=&#038;as_epq=Refuted+economic+doctrines&#038;as_oq=&#038;as_eq=&#038;num=10&#038;lr=&#038;as_filetype=&#038;ft=i&#038;as_sitesearch=crookedtimber.org&#038;as_qdr=all&#038;as_rights=&#038;as_occt=any&#038;cr=&#038;as_nlo=&#038;as_nhi=&#038;safe=images">John Quiggin&#8217;s book</a>.</p>

                                <p>From Lenny Dyksytra&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inq-phillydeals/Dykstras_letter_to_fans_.html">letter to friends about his bankruptcy filing yesterday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>William McKinley filed for protection while serving as Ohio&#8217;s governor in 1893. He was in debt to the tune of $130,000 (an insurmountable sum in those days!) before some friends eventually helped to bail him out. Three years later, he occupied a desk in the Oval Office. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>That seems much clearer than declaring you&#8217;re &#8220;not a quitter&#8221; while wearing hip-waders while your lawyer claims your multimillion dollar book deal (and private fortune) aren&#8217;t enough to deal with the cost of ethics charges against you.</p>
<p>Also, Jim Cramer may want to avoid Lenny for a while:<br />
<blockquote>Ulysses S. Grant went bankrupt after leaving office when a partner in an investment-banking venture swindled him. (I can certainly identify with this one.) [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Good thing Dykstra <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thestreet.com/story/10247787/dykstra-the-pinnacle-and-the-dream.html">doesn&#8217;t pretend to be an investment advisor</a>.<br />

</p>
<p>Oh. Well, at least no one ever sang his praises in the mass media, right?</p>
</p>
<p>Oops.</p>

<p>Seems as likely to work as anything else.</p>

                                <p>There is a reason I never believe people who judge the health of a company by its credit rating: the evidence isn&#8217;t there, and everyone in the market knows it isn&#8217;t there.</p>
<p>Here is a prime example: General Electric (GE; the company that Jack eviscerated) has a AAA credit rating.  It is also paying a 31 cent per share <em>quarterly</em> dividend.</p>
<p>The stock is <a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/quotes/ge">trading at $12/share</a> as I type.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a yield of 10.31%, per MarketWatch.</p>
<p>The 30-year Treasury, as I write (presumably the Friday close) is <a target="blank" href="http://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates/index.html">yielding 3.32%</a>.</p>
<p>Rounding off—I doubt anyone would seriously quibble the basis point—we have an allegedly-AAA company whose <em>stock</em> is trading 7.00% above Treasuries.  At a time when <a target="blank" href="http://bloomberg.com/markets/rates/corpbonds.html">the average &#8220;redemption yield&#8221; for investment-grade bonds is 6.47%</a>.</p>
<p>Now, in sane circumstances, people would be saying, &#8220;Oh, but that&#8217;s because GE will, certainly, cut its dividend.  And investors know that.&#8221;  However, CEO Jeffrey Immelt (the man charged with cleaning up Jack&#8217;s mess, who instead compounded his predecessor&#8217;s actions) assured investors that the dividend will not be cut, <a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=fc406610968e45feb7fb93bbec7dce50&#038;siteid=nwtpm&#038;sguid=pOcNmUHx20O0R5GhFlfw6A">even as he noted that GE expects an &#8220;extremely difficult&#8221; 2009</a>.</p>
<p>Moody&#8217;s has GE on credit watch with &#8220;outlook negative,&#8221; but <a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/general-electric-sees-more-credit/story.aspx?guid=%7BB65B0C9B-3426-422A-8480-EB752C91AAD8%7D">they&#8217;ve only been there since 13 January 2009</a>.  This is a company that is paying about <a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/quotes/ge">15% of its net earnings</a> out in dividends.  Calling GE &#8220;<a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=fc406610968e45feb7fb93bbec7dce50&#038;siteid=nwtpm&#038;sguid=pOcNmUHx20O0R5GhFlfw6A">not a growth stock</a>&#8221; is like calling Sears anything other than a real-estate play: so bloody obvious that it shouldn&#8217;t need to be said.</p>
<p>Yet, for some reason, it needed to be said.  And Moody&#8217;s is hanging there, ten days into &#8220;outlook negative&#8221; while the bleeding stock market is screaming &#8220;junk bond yield&#8221; on the equity.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong; GE is probably still investment grade.  Their <s>store credit card business</s> <s>ownership of NBC and affiliates</s> <s>consumer products division</s> defense contracts alone should keep them there.  But that&#8217;s what we said about GM too.</p>
<p>GM stock, which is <a target="blank" href="http://www.marketwatch.com/News/Story/Story.aspx?guid=fc406610968e45feb7fb93bbec7dce50&#038;siteid=nwtpm&#038;sguid=pOcNmUHx20O0R5GhFlfw6A">the downside risk cited by MarketWatch</a>, is currently yielding 28.5%.  If General Electric (GE) were yielding that level with the current dividend, it would be priced around $4.35—about another 64% decline.  [<i>As noted in the comments, GM has suspended its dividend and actually yields nothing; the MarketWatch site for some reason reports the yield based on the suspended dividend anyway.  -ATB</i>] </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re asking me, this points the way to a good piece of the other part of the &#8220;<a target="blank" href="http://www.academicwebpages.com/preview/mehra/pdf/The%20Equity%20Premium%20A%20Puzzle.pdf">equity premium puzzle</a>.&#8221;  But more on that in a later post.</p>

                                <p>All (somewhat***) <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/01/links-for-2009.html">via Mark Thoma</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123069094735544743.html">Thomas Frank in the WSJ</a> tells me why I always disagree with Robert (and the Other Economists) on the role of rating agencies:<br />
<blockquote>And who makes sure that Moody&#8217;s and its competitors downgrade what deserves to be downgraded? In 1999 the obvious answer would have been: the market, with its fantastic self-regulating powers.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you look at the spreads of various debt products, you can see that the market <em>was</em> doing that type of job even in 2007.  For instance, the debt market priced [&#8220;rated&#8221;] Bear Stearns&#8217;s five-year bond issue in August 2007 at 245 over: rather closer to &#8220;junk&#8221; status than its rating would have implied. If you compare the debt and stock markets, it&#8217;s easy to see which is closer to &#8220;rating.&#8221; Unfortunately, the area where information is more valuable* is not the one discussed and understood in the press, where BSC kept trading up for several more months.</p>
<p>If a market &#8220;regulates&#8221; but no one notices, does it make the WSJ?</p>
<p>Brad Setser <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/2008/12/31/relitigating-1998-at-the-end-of-2008/">finishes the destruction</a> of Tyler Cowen&#8217;s LTCM &#8220;argument&#8221; begun by Buce, while revealing its underbelly:<br />
<blockquote>The big banks called to the New York Fed were the creditors of LTCM and they were in some sense “bailed-in.” To avoid taking losses on the credit that they had extended to LTCM, they had to pony up and recapitalize LTCM. [footnoted exception for BSC]</p>
<p>It just so happened that the market recovered and it was possible for LTCM to exit many of its positions without taking large losses, or in some cases any losses. The banks that took control of LTCM when LTCM was on the ropes were able to unwind LTCM’s portfolio in a way that didn’t result in additional losses. But the result Cowen desired — large losses for the banks and broker-dealers who provided credit to LTCM – was quite possible if LTCM’s assets weren’t sufficient to cover all its liabilities. No creditor of LTCM was able to get rid of its exposure as a result of the Fed’s actions. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>It used to be a standard rule that if you wanted to bury something in a newspaper, you published it on a Friday, or the day before a holiday.  This seems to be what the NYT is doing with Casey Mulligan (previously discussed here here), who dropped the other shoe yesterday and was, amazingly, worse than expected.  PGL at Econospeak <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/12/chicago-economist-claims-homeowners.html">does the read and calls out the deed</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Mulligan is essentially saying that those poor saps who have lost their jobs actually quit so they can game the mortgage system. In other words, there is no such thing as involuntary unemployment or being forced to either lose one’s home versus enter into one of these mortgage modification programs.</p></blockquote>
<p>As noted <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/20/AR2008122000076_pf.html">in the WaPo two weeks ago</a> (via Stan Collender at Capital Gains and Games),** qualifying for the &#8220;mortgage modification&#8221; program (i.e., reducing the principal on your loan to not more than 90% of the current market value) <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/696/mortgage-politics-when-will-homeowners-realize-they-do-indeed-have-some-resp">is an onerous task</a>:<br />
<blockquote>He was hoping he could qualify for the federal government&#8217;s Hope for Homeowners program, which allows the Federal Housing Administration to insure a new mortgage if the lender voluntarily writes down the mortgage principal to 90 percent of the new value of the home. But when he asked his bank about that, he was told he would have to be on the brink of foreclosure or have an adjustable-rate mortgage.</p></blockquote>
<p>So Mulligan is basically blaming (1) those whose ability to keep their home depended on keeping their job and (2) those who took Alan Greenspan&#8217;s venal advice to go into ARMs just at the point at which he started raising rates.  Class act.</p>
<p>And, finally, lest you think I&#8217;m always bashing Tyler Cowen, he notes <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/12/chess-is-a-youn.html">a phenomenon in chess</a> and suggests a reasonable conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>I also see a general principle operating: the more exact a &#8220;science&#8221; the game becomes, the smaller is the value of accumulated experience relative to sheer skill.</p></blockquote>
<p>The sheer is dicey, but the identification of the shift in proportionality may be accurate, and probably has applications in economics as well.</p>
<p>*The debt market is less liquid and therefore considers information more valuable. This is effectively the corollary of the <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/12/momentum-trading.html">DeLong, Shliefer, Summers and Waldmann papers</a>: if you can&#8217;t depend on momentum trading, you take more care not to be the &#8220;greater fool.&#8221;</p>
<p>**Yes, I saw the Collender-bashing in my previous post.  I&#8217;ve said before that CG&#038;G became significantly less readable after the election, and am foolishly optimistic enough to believe that they may be returning to rationality. Besides, he happened to be correct: any given from increased military spending is definitionally no better (and likely worse) than spending the same amount on public infrastructure.</p>
<p>***I read PGL&#8217;s piece before seeing it in the links, but they&#8217;re all there.</p>

                                <p>Shira, the kids, and the m-i-l went to see <em>Mary Poppins</em> on Broadway for the former&#8217;s birthday.</p>
<p>In this version, the father still works for the bank and is given a choice early on: he can loan money to someone who promises to invest the money in business ventures in Foreign Lands and make marvelous returns, or he can loan money to a man who comes in with a local business plan to build a factory, employ local people, and make money. The gentleman even gives sixpence to each of the father&#8217;s children, somewhat strengthening the mirroring of the tuppence scene in the original:<br />

</p>
<p>But, of course, the other bankers all loan to the man who wants investors, and the father is suspended for not doing so.</p>
<p>Until, of course, the investment turns out to be a Ponzi scheme, and the factory turns out to be the loan that &#8220;saves the bank.&#8221;</p>
