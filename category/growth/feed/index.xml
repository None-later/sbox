				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are reasons to expect the second half of the year to be be stronger than the first. Here are two: (1) the rebound in industrial activity following supply chain disruptions, and (2) possible impetus to investment spending coming from the depreciation allowance that <em>expires</em> this year. These factors, though, are just dressing up what may be weak underlying demand. Why? Because without significant jobs growth, it&#8217;s unclear that we&#8217;ll see the wage, salary, and income generation needed for <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/reducing-household-financial-leverage.html">a healthy continuation of the deleveraging cycle</a>.</p>
<p>On the bright side, the Q1 2011 Gross Domestic Income, GDI, report does show a smart rebound in wage and salary accruals. The problem is, that corporate profit growth, which generally leads wage and salary accruals growth, is slowing. (GDI is the income side of the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm">GDP release</a> and you can download the <a href="http://bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=51&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2009&#038;LastYear=2011">data here</a>.)</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1jDPBJ-Bkkw/Td_0Pp2MctI/AAAAAAAADqU/27zoydzH0Gc/s1600/income_profit_chart.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1jDPBJ-Bkkw/Td_0Pp2MctI/AAAAAAAADqU/27zoydzH0Gc/s400/income_profit_chart.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />READ MORE AFTER THE JUMP!<br /><a name="more"></a>The chart illustrates annual domestic profit and wage/salary growth spanning 1981 Q1 to 2011 Q1. The series are deflated by the GDP price index. Real domestic profit growth has been robust, peaking at 65% Yr/Yr in Q4 2009 and decelerating to 7% in Q1 2011. The surge in corporate profits brought real wage and salary accruals growth to a 2.1% annual pace in Q1 2011.</p>
<p>With higher input costs and slowing <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/prod2.t01.htm">productivity gains</a>, domestic profit margins are likely to be squeezed unless demand re-emerges smartly. The implication is that real wage and salary accruals growth may be nearing &#8216;as good as it gets&#8217; territory during the aftermath of a <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/01/balance-sheet-recessions.html">balance sheet recession</a>.</p>
<p>And labor&#8217;s losing it&#8217;s share of the pie. The chart below illustrates the various component contributions to annual gross domestic income growth. (the best that I could do on size vs. clarity &#8211; <em>click to enlarge</em>)</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lTo2Bp0nqfk/Td_18wB97VI/AAAAAAAADqc/9VJFy_z4eck/s1600/gdi_contribution.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lTo2Bp0nqfk/Td_18wB97VI/AAAAAAAADqc/9VJFy_z4eck/s400/gdi_contribution.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a>The data are quarterly data spanning 1981 Q1 to 2011 Q1 and deflated by the GDP price index. Wage and salary accruals have become a smaller part of income growth in the last decade. Spanning 1981-2000, the average contribution to income growth from wage and salary accruals was 1.5% (simple average), where that spanning the years 2001-current was just 0.3%. The average corporate profit contribution held firm over the same two periods, roughly 0.3%.</p>
<p>Growth momentum has slowed over the period, however, the deceleration in wage and salary contribution is quite striking. I can&#8217;t explain it even with the &#8216;demographic shift&#8217;; but this trend is likewise reflected in the <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EMRATIO?cid=12">employment to population ratio</a>.</p>
<p>Wages, income, spending power, consumption, saving &#8211; they&#8217;re all different ways to say the same thing: earned income can be spent in one of three ways, on taxes, consumption, or saving. And in this recovery, saving via income gains is important as households <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/reducing-household-financial-leverage.html">further deleverage</a>. We can&#8217;t <em>afford</em> <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/08/compensationless-recovery.html">compensationless expansion</a>.</p>
<p>The key to growth in 2011 and 2012 is wages, salaries, and income &#8211; here&#8217;s to hoping.</p>
<p><em><strong>Rebecca Wilder</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/search/label/Spencer%20England">Spencer</a> has a foreboding point <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/gdp-another-disappointing-report.html#jsid-1306438255-349">in comments from my earlier post on GDP</a>. He notes that inflation measured by the GDP deflator probably understates the impetus to domestic prices &#8211; domestic purchases is more appropriate at a 3.8% annual rate. The implication, according to Spencer via Email is, &#8220;If the inflation rate is really 3.8%, not 1.9 %, it strongly implies that the dominant cause of the economic weakness is higher inflation, not supply chain disruptions.&#8221;</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week further evidence has emerged of Germany&#8217;s slowing growth trajectory. At 4.9% annual growth (calendar-adjusted) and a tightening bias from the ECB, this was, of course, to be expected.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HpJiI2pQ-cw/Tdvv8muO0iI/AAAAAAAADok/1K6vXhhEvsg/s1600/ifo_pmi_chart.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HpJiI2pQ-cw/Tdvv8muO0iI/AAAAAAAADok/1K6vXhhEvsg/s400/ifo_pmi_chart.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a> READ MORE AFTER THE JUMP!<a name="more"></a><br />Yesterday the Manufacturing May &#8216;Flash&#8217; <a href="http://www.markiteconomics.com/MarkitFiles/Pages/PressCenter.aspx">PMI by Markit Research </a>highlighted, in my view, that sentiment is unlikely to remain at these absurdly elevated levels indefinitely, as the index dropped to 58.2 from 62 in April. Notably, the index remained above 60 for five consecutive months.</p>
<p>Today the Ifo Institute released its <a href="http://www.cesifo-group.de/portal/page/portal/ifoHome/a-winfo/d1index/10indexgsk">business survey for May</a>, revealing that industry and trade remained stable in May. This index hovers at record highs compared to a post-unification time series.</p>
<p>Overall, while the two sentiment indicators diverged this month (the PMI waning, while the Ifo holding firm), the story remains that Germany is slowing down. Furthermore, the Ifo survey portends a deceleration in industrial production growth (IP), perhaps over the next quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 1</strong> The ratio of the components of Ifo &#8211; expectations and current conditions &#8211; suggest a sharp reversal in the industrial production growth trend.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4m8BcDtJBHg/Tdu84WSg92I/AAAAAAAADoU/6WUox0d8WxM/s1600/ifo_ip.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4m8BcDtJBHg/Tdu84WSg92I/AAAAAAAADoU/6WUox0d8WxM/s400/ifo_ip.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a>The chart correlates annual industrial production growth with the % differential between the expectations and current conditions components of the Ifo index at a 6-month lead. I don&#8217;t expect IP growth to turn negative, but a slowdown is certainly due.</p>
<p><strong>Exhibit 2</strong> Take the Ifo sentiment with a grain of salt!</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Enk27EWMwn8/Tdu84EtMh_I/AAAAAAAADoM/frh7VuaL1DE/s1600/ifo_gdp.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Enk27EWMwn8/Tdu84EtMh_I/AAAAAAAADoM/frh7VuaL1DE/s400/ifo_gdp.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a>Ifo really is more of a coincident indicator of economic growth than anything else. For example, the Ifo composite has a 77% correlation coefficient with annual real GDP growth. Previous to the current recovery/expansion, the Ifo index hit a peak of 108.7 in March 2008 only to see growth decelerate sharply the next quarter, 2.7% Y/Y to 1.6% Y/Y. My point is, while it&#8217;s a decent indicator of economic strength during expansions, it&#8217;s a terrible predictor of turning points.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re not at a turning point now &#8211; Ifo plus PMI demonstrate that the German economy continues to expand, albeit at a slower pace.</p>
<p>The real question is, what does this mean for the rest of Europe, specifically the Periphery? It&#8217;s not totally clear, but certainly with Germany <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/euro-area-gdp-report-unbalanced.html">contributing more than 50% to the quarterly growth rate in Q1</a>, downside risks are emerging. <a href="http://www.investmentpostcards.com/2011/05/24/eurozone-pmi-further-slide-on-the-cards/">Prieur du Plessis argues </a>that this is related to the global slowdown in manufacturing.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by cactus</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://meganmcardle.theatlantic.com/archives/2009/07/question_answered.php">Megan McArdle</a> responds to <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/07/megan-mcardle-has-question.html">a post I wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So Obama doesn&#8217;t count because he&#8217;s not really a Democrat.  But Bill Clinton was.  But Richard Nixon&#8211;the chap who implemented price controls and massively expanded Social Security and Medicare&#8211;was definitely a Republican.  Jimmy Carter, who deregulated like mad:  definitely a Democrat.</p>
<p>What are these policies that neatly define Democrats to exclude only the ones who happen to have crappy growth?  On what metric does Barack Obama register as farther to the right than Bill Clinton?  Because from what I remember of the 1990s, I spent most of the decade listening to my genuinely left-wing friends weep that he&#8217;d betrayed them.  Remember Edelman&#8217;s resigning in protest of welfare reform?</p></blockquote>
<p>I thought it was unnecessary at this point to explain the one thing I&#8217;ve pointed out time and again differentiates Republicans from Democrats.  I think the first time was <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/taxes-and-growth-rates-two-graphs.html">here</a>.  (I tend not to break out JFK from LBJ, or Nixon from Ford because JFK and Ford only served a short time, but the post that is attached is illustrative of behavior, not performance.)  </p>
<p>The difference is the tax burden &#8211; that is, the percentage of people&#8217;s income that gets collected in taxes.  Not the marginal rate &#8211; the amount people actually pay divided by the amount they make.  And there is a difference, a big difference.  As an example:  George Herbert Walker Bush famously raised marginal rates.  It might have cost him an election.  But GHW Bush also quietly lowered the tax burden.  He did it through the people he appointed to the IRS,  through the degree of compliance he sought, through the way his IRS interpreted existing rules and regulations and through how the body of tax rules and regulations changed while he was in office. </p>
<p>Going back to 1952 at least, every Democrat, every single one, has increased the tax burden.  Every single Republican <s>raised</s> lowered [h/t Bruce Webb] them.  The data in the attached post is from the IRS and goes back only to 1952, but one can wander over to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=58&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2009&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaBox=no#Mid">BEA&#8217;s NIPA Table 2.1</a> and compute the tax burden ourselves with National Income data going back to 1929, and whaddaya know, the rule also works for Hoover, FDR, and Truman.  Just barely for Truman&#8230; but then he is the exception on performance too, right?  </p>
<p>Now, I doubt you could find a single person on the right of the political spectrum who would tell you that taxes don&#8217;t affect economic growth.   They all believe taxes affect growth.  Of course, the story they tell is that cutting taxes produces faster economic growth.  The fact is, however, the Presidents who cut tax burdens tended to produce slower economic growth than those who raised taxes.  (I&#8217;ve discussed why in a number of other posts, and I don&#8217;t feel like rehashing or looking for those posts now.  I also note this isn&#8217;t just true of Presidents.  My fellow Angry Bear, Spencer, once pointed out that there are a lot of people out there who seem to think we&#8217;d all be better off if the country was Alabama than if it was Massachussetts.)  </p>
<p>Unfortunately, tax burden data, like any other bit of real world data, fluctuates somewhat from year to year, so its really going to be a while before we know what direction they&#8217;re really headed over O&#8217;s administration.  As in, several years.  And most of us are impatient.  So we&#8217;d like to have some leading indicators, so to speak, of what Obama is going to do, of where he&#8217;s going to fall on the one R v. D divide that really matters.  And right now, he&#8217;s behaving like the folks who have cut tax burdens in the past.  He&#8217;s also talking like them.  His bail-out is identical to GW&#8217;s, and when he talks about taxes, it doesn&#8217;t sound like Clinton, it sounds like GW.  So its reasonable to wonder whether he&#8217;s going to stick to the R v. D rule.  And the next test coming up is healthcare; a D would be putting his political capital on the public option right now.  An R wouldn&#8217;t.   What&#8217;s it gonna be, we&#8217;ll soon see.</p>
<p>More below the fold.</p>
<p>Now, in Megan&#8217;s post, she refers to &#8220;Cactus and his merry band of madmen.&#8221;  I&#8217;m not sure the merry band of madmen over here truly have a leader, much less that I&#8217;m the one (Dan is the official grand poobah in charge of the blog, after all!!) but I&#8217;m guessing you aren&#8217;t a part of that merry band of madmen if any of the following apply to you:</p>
<ol>
<li>You do not believe that since 1929 at least, every single D has increased the tax burden and every single R has decreased the tax burden, despite the fact that the data shows precisely this, and despite the fact that it fits the caricature of Ds and Rs to a T, so to speak.</li>
<li>You do not believe that since 1929, Ds have generally outperformed Rs when it comes to real economic growth, despite the fact that the data shows precisely this.</li>
<li>You do not believe that administrations that cut the tax burden have also generally been the administrations that grew more rapidly, despite 1. and 2.</li>
<li>You do not believe that the tax burden could possibly have anything to do with growth.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do believe these things, if you believe what the data shows , I&#8217;m sorry to say but you&#8217;re one of us, one of the merry band of madmen.   On the other hand, if you fit these rules, there are a whole lot of folks out there, Megan McArdle included, who would  consider you sane.  </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We have been discussing a lot of economics through the political viewer lately. And I certainly have laid my point of view out there, but I also like the theory discussion. I like to think and know how stuff works or how someone interprets what they see. I believe discussing theories leads to better political discussion. With that, I hope this might inspire some tangent topics into the political here at AB.</p>
<p>This is a paper out of France by <a href="http://www.iea.org/Textbase/work/2004/eewp/Ayres-paper1.pdf">Robert U Ayres &#038; Benjamin Warr </a>titled: Accounting for Growth: The role of physical work</p>
<p>They suggest the increasing extraction of work from energy do to the increasing development of energy use is the missing factor that explains our growth.<br />
<blockquote>“However the major result of the paper is that it is not `raw’ energy (exergy) as an input, but exergy converted to useful (physical) work that – along with capital and(human)labor – really explains output and drives long-term economic growth.” “However, if we replace raw energy as an input by `useful work’ (the sum total of all types of physical work by animals, prime movers and heat transfer systems) as a factor of production, the historical growth path of the US is reproduced with high accuracy from 1900 until the mid 1970s, without any residual except during brief periods of economic dislocation, and with fairly high accuracy since then.”</p></blockquote>
<p>There key concept is the definition of exergy.</p>
<blockquote><p>“The formal definition of exergy is the maximum work that could theoretically be done by a system as it approaches thermodynamic equilibrium with its surroundings, reversibly. Thus exergy is effectively equivalent to potential work. There is an important distinction between potential work and actual work done by animals or machines. The conversion efficiency between exergy (potential work), as an input, and actual work done, as an output, is also an important concept in thermodynamics. The notion of thermodynamic efficiency plays a key role in this paper.<br />To summarize: the technical definition of exergy is the maximum work that a subsystem can do as it approaches thermodynamic equilibrium (reversibly) with its surroundings.” </p></blockquote>
<p>This summarizes their theories development:</p>
<blockquote><p>The supposed link between factor payments and factor productivities gives the national accounts a direct and fundamental (but spurious) role in production theory. In reality, however, (as noted in the introduction) the economy produces final products from a chain of intermediates, not directly from raw materials or, still less, from labor and capital without material inputs. In the simple single sector model used to `prove’ the relationship between factor productivity and factor payments, this crucial fact is neglected. Allowing for the omission of intermediates (by introducing even a two-sector or three-sector production process) the picture changes completely. In effect, downstream value-added stages act as productivity multipliers. This enables a factor receiving a very small share of the national income directly, to contribute a much larger effective share of the value of aggregate production, i.e. to be much more productive than its share of overall labor and capital would seem to imply if the simple theory of income allocation were applicable [Ayres 2001a].</p></blockquote>
<p>If this is true, then we have a bigger problem concerning how to keep this boat floating than subprime lending and fed rates. We have a policy problem. And that speaks to all the work Cactus has done about presidents.</p>
<p>Related to Cactus&#8217; work, this chart from the this paper is interesting. It is the unexplained portion of growth by their theory.</p>

<div>Note that this phenomenon begins right about where we see the lowest point of the top 1% share of income, just after we see the split of productivity from wages and the beginnings of the supplyside policies and a change to a net debtor nation. The authors suggest some of this is do to conservation.</div>
<p>
<blockquote>“We conjecture that a kind of phase-change or structural shift took place at that time, triggered perhaps by the so-called energy crisis, precipitated by the OPEC blockade. Higher energy prices induced significant investments in energy conservation and systems optimization.”</p></blockquote>
<p>
<div>They further refine the explanation with:</div>
<p>
<blockquote>“The marginal productivity of capital has started to increase whereas the marginal productivity of physical work – resulting from increases in the efficiency of energy conversion – has declined slightly.”</p></blockquote>
<div>Could this marginal capital productivity increase be a result of our policy focus on capital as the driver of growth? Money from money? Are we seeing in their explanation that part of our growth that is borrowed from our future, thus artificially created? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I read this paper it made me think about the European economies who have been focusing on alternative energy development, wind in Denmark, solar in Germany, (Japan), wave generation in England and northern parts, geothermal in Iceland/Greenland. This paper to me suggests that this coming election has at the core of all our topical issues (health care, war, inflation) energy. As the authors conclude keeping in mind peak production issues and the declining output of Saudi&#8217;s fields: </div>
<div>
<blockquote>“From a long-term sustainability viewpoint, this conclusion carries a powerful implication. If economic growth is to continue without proportional increases in fossil fuel consumption, it is vitally important to exploit new ways of generating value added without doing more work. But it is also essential to develop ways of reducing fossil fuel exergy inputs per unit of physical work output (i.e. increasing conversion efficiency). In other words, energy (exergy) conservation is probably the main key to long term environmental sustainability.”</p></blockquote>
