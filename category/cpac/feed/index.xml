				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I found this link in Sitemeter and am in a quixotic mood. I couldn&#8217;t resist chasing it down as I wondered what Free Republic was and how Mike&#8217;s material could be used in a debate there.  </p>
<p>Lifted from comments at <a href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2845094/posts" target="_blank">Free Republic</a> website regarding Newt&#8217;s speech at CPAC earlier this week (and a spirited debate of advocates for Santorum and Romney) comes this note from a Newt admirerÂ regardingÂ Newt&#8217;s downsizing the &#8216;federal government&#8217; in the 1990&#8217;s (and to his credit linked appropriately).  He uses one of Mike&#8217;s early charts on executive branch civilian employment measures of compararing Presidents:  <br />
<blockquote>To: American Constitutionalist Â </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><div>Chart of federal civilian employees&#8230;big decline under the Newtster, even while the economy was booming. The decline leveled off post-Newtster. We can see the Carter/Bush eras saw declines in their recessions but Newt kept it going in good economic times.  </div>
<div></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Another commenter not linked to here chased the link (to his/her credit) to the OMB tables and but then came to the conclusion Mike made up the numbers.</p>
<p>I am not proposing cosmic signigicance here, but a scratch of the head and a &#8216;WTF&#8217;. Â  As a leftie I suppose the conclusion could be that President Clinton found Newt&#8217;s tenure as Speaker so less than challenging he decided that he didn&#8217;t need the staff.  Aside from all the other business.  Thanks Ken for the idea.
