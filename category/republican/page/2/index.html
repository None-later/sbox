<p>McCain <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122315505846605217.html?mod=googlenews_wsj">is going after Medicare and Medicaid</a>.<br />
<blockquote>But Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Sen. McCain&#8217;s senior policy adviser, said Sunday that the campaign has always planned to fund the tax credits, in part, with savings from Medicare and Medicaid. Those government health-care programs serve seniors, poor families and the disabled. Medicare spending for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 is estimated at $457.5 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>At least he made it official.</p>

<p>UPDATE:  PGL beat me to this one by about half an hour and is much nicer about the proposal than I <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/10/mccains-health-care-for-well-to-do-but.html">over at Econospeak</a>.

                                <p>Let&#8217;s see.  There are a bunch of people ready to riot on the streets—or at least do the White Person version of rioting and vote Republican, mainly because of the lies of several House Republicans.</p>
<p>And there are a precious few people who believe action needs to be taken and—while they might prefer, say, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/10/dean-baker-on-t.html">The Swedish Model</a> as both more efficient and more likely to succeed—are willing to give Paulson/Bernanke a chance to be immortalized, even knowing that the odds are rather higher than Brad DeLong hopes that the immortality will be of the James Buchanan/Herbert Hoover variety more than General George Marshall. (Daniel Davies Three Laws have not been repealed, but the wolf really is at the door.)</p>
<p>So what do we see from the Democrats who, one way or the other, are going to be <s>credited</s> blamed with anything that passes?  Besides <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/no-bailout-plan.html">arch-idiocy from the &#8220;progressives&#8221;</a>, there was the rumor that they might actually <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_09_28_archive.html#4958501322080983185">produce a bill that Democrats can vote for</a>?</p>
<p>You know how this story ends.</p>
<p>Kathryn notes that the Senate bill is <a href="http://www.kathryncramer.com/kathryn_cramer/2008/10/my-note-to-sena.html">even more of a giveaway</a> than the House version was.<br />
<blockquote>[N]ews reports suggest that the plan to be voted on by the Senate involves tax cuts. Tax cuts have no place in a bailout plan of this magnitude. Instead, the repealing of Bush&#8217;s tax breaks to the wealthy and large corporation should possibly be part of such a plan. Somehow this has to get paid for.</p></blockquote>
<p>She means reports <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/02/business/02bailout.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;oref=slogin&#038;pagewanted=print">such as this one</a>:<br />
<blockquote>“I’m optimistic that we’re going to have a significant bipartisan victory on the rescue plan here in the Senate tonight,” said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who Tuesday reached an agreement with Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, to add $100 billion in tax breaks&#8230;.</p>
<p> “This bill has been packaged with a lot of very popular things to give it even more momentum,” said Senator Jeff Sessions, Repubican of Alabama, an opponent of the measure that is expected to easily clear the 60-vote threshold in the Senate, providing some momentum for the House vote now set for Friday.</p>
<p>But the new items also increase the burden on future taxpayers. The $100 billion in tax breaks, which offer incentives for the use of renewable energy and relieve 24 million households from an estimated $65 billion alternative-minimum tax scheduled to take effect this year, will not be offset by spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere.</p></blockquote>
<p>and while Kathryn was optimistic about one part of the bill:<br />
<blockquote>I do support some of the smaller scale proposals, such as raising the FDIC insurance level to 250,000.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Devil in the details makes even this a c.f. of major proportion:<br />
<blockquote>Moreover, the increase in federal deposit insurance will not be financed, as the insurance program now is, by assessing a higher fee on the banks that benefit. Instead, banks will get an open-ended line of credit directly to the Treasury Department — meaning, taxpayers.</p></blockquote>
<p>and when a chance of sanity appears, the power of the Republican Party is, as usual, never to be underestimated:<br />
<blockquote>House officials spent much of Tuesday considering their own changes, including an extension of unemployment pay and a $1,000 tax credit for less affluent homeowners.</p>
<p>But those plans are not likely to advance, given the Senate decision. While the Senate left the door open slightly to other additions to the bill, such revisions would need the agreement of the full Senate, and the House proposals were likely to be blocked by Senate Republicans.</p></blockquote>
<p>Right.  Because the unemployed and &#8220;less affluent&#8221; homeowners would actually <em>spend</em> that money and stimulate the economy, and, in turn, the financial services industry.</p>
<p>As it currently stands, the &#8220;bailout&#8221; makes no sense, especially given the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/630-billion-pumped-into-economy-before.html">other</a> <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/no-need-for-bailout-any-more.html">actions</a> that largely made it unnecessary. (The Financial Services industry will be running no better, but at least they get to gull some investors for a while longer. And those that fail in such an environment have enough cash flow problems that propping them up is a waste of resources.)</p>
<p>Call your Senators; tell them to vote &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/bring-congress.html">lays out the breakdown</a>.</p>
<p>When 2/3 of your party believes that taking the Dow down <s>600</s> 750+ points is a Good Idea, claims such as &#8220;the party of fiscal responsibility&#8221;—or even the &#8220;party of Wall Street&#8221;—fail the free market test Big Time.</p>
<p>If I weren&#8217;t worried about the coming harvest, I would fully endorse the DeLong proposal.</p>
<p>UPDATE:  John Boehner <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080929/financial_meltdown.html">lies with impunity</a> though Julie Hirschfield Davis of the AP wakes up later:<br />
<blockquote>Republican leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, said he and other Republicans were pained to vote for such measure, but he agreed that in light of the potential consequences for the economy and all Americans, &#8220;I think that we need to renew our efforts to find a solution that Congress can support.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Why is this a lie?  As a correspondent who would probably prefer me not to link to his blog said, &#8220;Pelosi delivered about 60% of her caucus for the bill;  Boehner<br />delivered about 30%.  Is the House [Republican leadership] incompetent[?]&#8221;</p>
<p>Davis returns to reporting a moment later, identifying the party that deflected first:<br />
<blockquote>In the House, &#8220;no&#8221; votes came from both the Democratic and Republican sides of the aisle. More than two-thirds of Republicans and 40 percent of Democrats opposed the bill. Several Democrats in close election fights waited until the last moment, then went against the bill as it became clear the vast majority of Republicans were opposing it.</p></blockquote>
<p>So instead of maybe overpaying about $700 billion for assets over the next year, in the hope that banks will loan again now, the Republicans in the House—with John &#8220;we need to renew our efforts to find a solution&#8221; Boehner pretending to be the Voice of Reason—decided <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/29/making-700-billion-look-small/">to knock $1,200,000,000,000 out of the stock market in a single day</a>.</p>
<p>Talk about your multiplier effect.</p>
<p>Davis continues by quoting the Minority Leader and the Minority Whip both whining about how evil Nancy Pelosi is—and reporting the truth of the matter:<br />
<blockquote>Republicans blamed Pelosi&#8217;s scathing speech near the close of the debate&#8230;for the defeat. It was not much different from her usual tough words against the president and his party.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could have gotten there today had it not been for the partisan speech that the speaker gave on the floor of the House,&#8221; Boehner said.</p>
<p>Rep. Roy Blunt, R-Mo., the whip, estimated that Pelosi&#8217;s speech changed the minds of a dozen Republicans who might otherwise have supported the plan.</p></blockquote>
<p>So the Minority Whip might have been able to deliver almost 40% (78-120) of his party for this bipartisan effort—assuming we believe him—if not for the fact that Nancy Pelosi has a sense of history.  Gosh, I&#8217;m really impressed now.  As is Barney Frank, who notes that &#8220;country first&#8221; does not appear to be the motto of the Republican House members:<br />
<blockquote>That amounted to an appalling accusation by Republicans against Republicans, said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., chairman of the Financial Services Committee: &#8220;Because somebody hurt their feelings, they decide to punish the country.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Presumably, because that worked so well for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_government_shutdown_of_1995">Newt Gingrich in 1995</a>.</p>

                                <p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: Not even <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122230374700773663.html?mod=djemEditorialPage">the Wall Street Journal editorial page</a> fell for McCain&#8217;s &#8220;reasoning&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>So count us as mystified by Senator John McCain&#8217;s decision yesterday to suspend his campaign and call for a postponement in Friday&#8217;s first Presidential debate so that he and Barack Obama can work out a consensus bill to stabilize the financial system. This is supposed to be evidence of leadership?</p></blockquote>
<p>I was muddling through some papers this afternoon, so I missed everything after John &#8220;Coming to the Wry&#8221; McCain&#8217;s decision that, after he got schooled by a comedienne, he needed a excuse to skip tomorrow night&#8217;s scheduled debate. Fortunately, Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/john-mccain-a-s.html">covered that part</a>, including <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/senator-durbin.html">the sane reaction to McCain&#8217;s &#8220;I will bring my superpowers to bear&#8221; statement</a>:<br />
<blockquote>It&#8217;s not economic leadership that Senator McCain would bring to these negotiations; it&#8217;s presidential politics – which is the last thing we need if we really want to solve the serious problems our nation faces.</p></blockquote>
<p>But the Word of the Day goes to <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/09/24/dont-panic">Felix Salmon</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I have a feeling I know what President Bush is going to say in his address to the nation tonight, but the single biggest message has already been sent, thanks to his decision to schedule the last-minute broadcast coming on the same day as John McCain announced he was suspending his presidential campaign to try to wrestle the bailout to the ground. The message is the same as the one sent by Hank Paulson over the weekend, when he asked for unprecedented power and unaccountability in structuring the bailout fund. And the message is not one that politicians should be sending:</p>
<p>Panic!</p></blockquote>
<p>After saying nice things about Chris Dodd and Barack Obama, who have stayed focussed, Salmon returned to McCain, and used a form of That Word again:<br />
<blockquote>McCain&#8217;s statement, in this context, was truly unhelpful. This is panicky, not constructive:<br />
<blockquote>It has become clear that no consensus has developed to support the Administration&#8217;s proposal. I do not believe that the plan on the table will pass as it currently stands, and we are running out of time.</p></blockquote>
<p>This strikes me as a profound misreading of the public&#8217;s mood, a bit like Rudy Giuliani&#8217;s decision to try to extend his second and final term as mayor on the grounds that only he was qualified to do the job. America does not want to elect a politician who can&#8217;t help construct a bailout package without abandoning a foreign-policy debate. Nor should it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, I played volleyball while Bush fiddled.  Fortunately, <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/bush-on-bailouts/">Floyd Norris</a> got paid to watch tonight&#8217;s performance:<br />
<blockquote>President Bush tonight gave a reasonably good explanation of how we got into this “financial crisis,” even if his list of causes was a little selective. His first cause was the willingness of foreigners to lend us money, a problem that we must hope will continue as the Treasury tries to borrow $700 billion to finance this bailout&#8230;.</p>
<p>If there are any decisions his administration made that helped to worsen the situation, he did not mention them&#8230;.</p>
<p>In boosting his plan, he took credit for the idea that there should be limits on executive pay, which his administration had opposed until today. It would have been nice if he had conceded that was a change, but you can’t have everything.</p></blockquote>
<p>Situation Normal, down to the &#8220;his lips are moving&#8221; moment:<br />
<blockquote>The most jarring part of the speech was his statement that his plan called for the government to buy troubled mortgage assets “at current low prices” and hold them until the value rises. In fact, the basis of the proposal is to buy assets at well above current market value — called fire-sale prices by Ben Bernanke — and thus recapitalize the financial system. They hope the market value will rise above what they pay, but that is not the same as buying at current low prices. Does he not understand that, or does he not want to acknowledge it?</p></blockquote>
<p>I love questions for which there is no wrong answer.</p>

                                <p>Take a page from Douglas North et al., I will simply note that if the institutions charged with managing the process are corrupt, the chance of success approaches zero.</p>
<p>Case in point, <a href="http://norris.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/are-regulators-supposed-to-set-prices/">Christopher Cox (R-BoughtAndPaid) and the SEC</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The interesting thing here is that we have already heard that the S.E.C. staff almost immediately demanded such changes. Christopher Cox, the chairman, emphasized Tuesday that the commission imposed its new rules after conferring with the Fed and the Treasury. If he consulted with anyone, inside or outside the S.E.C., who actually understood how markets work, I have not heard about it. [emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>So the two institutions that are battling to be able to say fu with $700,000,000,000 in taxpayer money could not provide Cox with reasonable guidance.</p>
<p>I feel so much better.</p>

                                <p>Via <a href="http://rogerailes.blogspot.com/2008/09/trip-to-nowhere-shorter-sharia-palin.html">The Good Roger Ailes</a>, ABC News reports that rape kits aren&#8217;t the only thing Sarah Palin tried to leave <a href="http://www.abcnews.go.com/print?id=5844710">the responsibility of the victim</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Fighting back against allegations she may have fired her then-Public Safety Commissioner, Walt Monegan, for refusing to go along with a personal vendetta, Palin on Monday argued in a legal filing that she fired Monegan because he had a &#8220;rogue mentality&#8221; and was bucking her administration&#8217;s directives.</p>
<p>&#8220;The last straw,&#8221; her lawyer argued, came when he planned a trip to Washington, D.C., to seek federal funds for an aggressive anti-sexual-violence program. The project, expected to cost from $10 million to $20 million a year for five years, would have been the first of its kind in Alaska, which leads the nation in reported forcible rape.[emphases mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>The catch:<br />
<blockquote>But the governor&#8217;s staff authorized the trip, according to an internal travel document from the Department of Public Safety, released Friday in response to an open records request.</p>
<p>The document, a state travel authorization form, shows that Palin&#8217;s chief of staff, Mike Nizich, approved Monegan&#8217;s trip to Washington, D.C., &#8220;to attend meeting with Senator Murkowski.&#8221; The date next to Nizich&#8217;s signature reads June 18. </p></blockquote>
<p>and the excuse:<br />
<blockquote>According to Ruaro, Monegan asked for—and received—approval for the travel without telling Palin&#8217;s staff his reason for going. &#8220;As a matter of routine, the travel was approved by Mike Nizich &#8230; weeks before the actual purpose was made clear by former Commissioner Monegan,&#8221; Ruaro wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>Millions for a Bridge to Nowhere, Nothing for Rape Prevention.  Glad to see she has her priorities—and Family Values—straight.</p>

                                <p>Steve Waldman graduated Columbia the year after Barack Obama. His brother Mike was Bill Clinton&#8217;s chief speechwriter.

<blockquote>When Isaac was in Jerusalem he was there to witness some of that judgment, some of that conflict, when a Palestinian from East Jerusalem took a bulldozer and went plowing through a score of cars, killing numbers of people. Judgment&#8211;you can&#8217;t miss it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or who refer to your most Orthodox members as &#8220;butchers.&#8221;***<br />
<blockquote>Then I noticed, right out of the corner of my eye, five yeshiva bu[t]chers. Now, that&#8217;s the ultra-orthodox young seminary students. Maybe you&#8217;ve seen the pictures, you know, with the black hats and the black coats, and the side curls, you know. And they were walking towards us with a look of grim determination on their faces, and I knew we were in trouble&#8230;.And I&#8217;m thinkin&#8217;, &#8220;That&#8217;s it. We&#8217;re gonna get martyred right here on the streets of Jerusalem.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And who then reiterate that you are not the Chosen People until you are Christian:<br />
<blockquote>Our Father in heaven,</p>
<p>We stand before You as a people who&#8217;ve experienced Your grace, and we acknowledge that that grace was first extended to our people through Your people, the Jews; that there is not a one here in this room who would know Jesus and serve Him if there had not been a Jew, generations ago, that spoke Jesus&#8217; name to our people. Father, that comes full circle and we wish to extend Your grace back to Your people. And we pray and we ask that as a result of this time here, and as a result of this offering, there will be people among the Jews today who come to say the name &#8220;Jesus&#8221; with faith.</p>
<p>In His glorious name we pray, amen.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now Steve Waldman may be—probably is—correct when he says &#8220;the <em>standard</em> preaching of many evangelical churches will be frightening to some Jews, just as the standard preaching of many African American churches were scary to whites.&#8221; And when he quotes Sarah Palin&#8217;s pastor saying, &#8220;You either receive the King that God has appointed for all mankind or you reject Him. There&#8217;s no neutral ground on that—none,&#8221; he clearly takes that as scary rhetoric.</p>
<p>But there is a difference between scary, &#8220;yeah us!&#8221; rhetoric, and being openly declared second-class citizens, or outright described as &#8220;butchers.&#8221;  Or, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/i-am-confused.html">as Brad DeLong so aptly put it</a>:<br />
<blockquote>John McCain wants to nominate his friend Joe Lieberman for vice president, is told that he cannot, and so he backs down and instead nominates somebody who takes their children to a church where they teach that suicide bombers in Tel Aviv are righteously executing God&#8217;s vengeance on Israel for rejecting Jesus Christ.</p></blockquote>
<p>*That several people in private conversation have suggested doubts about Obama from a Jewish perspective supports the premise.</p>
<p>**Among other things.  She&#8217;s also a long-time friend of my wife&#8217;s.</p>
<p>***Waldman posts the transcript as &#8220;buchers,&#8221; but <em>bucher</em> is Hebrew for &#8220;bookstores,&#8221; and it seems more probable, in the context, that this is a typo.</p>

<p>I gave up on the Party long ago; I gave up hope when a (very) distant relative wrote an op-ed for the NYT on why he would not support impeachment in 1998, and was attacked by the party for the next few years, before he chose not to run for re-election in 2004. But if this is really the platform of a Republican Presidential candidate:<br />
<blockquote>1.  Energy Independence. <br />   2. Tax Reform. <br />   3. Border Security.<br />   4. Life. <br />   5. Defending Marriage.</p></blockquote>
<p>then I&#8217;m around to agreeing with Brad DeLong: <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/08/impeach-george.html">Shut it down</a>.  See if you can build something sane.</p>

                                <p>From a <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119144942897748150.html">poll by the WSJ/NBC </a>reported in October, 2007 comes:</p>
<p><em>While 60% of respondents said they want the next president and Congress to continue cutting taxes, 32% said it&#8217;s time for some tax increases on the wealthiest Americans to reduce the budget deficit and pay for health care.<br /></em><br />Can you imagine? They have started to figure out that their pocketbooks matter.</p>
<p><em>In a December 1999 Wall Street Journal-NBC poll, 37% of Republicans said trade deals had helped the U.S. and 31% said they had hurt, while 26% said they made no difference.<br />The new poll asked a broader but similar question. It posed two statements to voters. The first was, &#8220;Foreign trade has been good for the U.S. economy, because demand for U.S. products abroad has resulted in economic growth and jobs for Americans here at home and provided more choices for consumers.&#8221;<br />The second was, &#8220;Foreign trade has been bad for the U.S. economy, because imports from abroad have reduced demand for American-made goods, cost jobs here at home, and produced potentially unsafe products.&#8221;<br />Asked which statement came closer to their own view, 59% of Republicans named the second statement, while 32% pointed to the first.<br /></em><br />I don&#8217;t think these questions are the best framed.  They seem kind of load in that it states “foreign trade” instead of Free Trade, or NAFTA.  But, the qualifications I&#8217;m sure are what the people responded to.<br /><em></em><br />From <a href="http://www.timeinc.net/fortune/information/presscenter/fortune/press_releases/20080118_economysurvey.html">Fortune Magazine</a>, January, 2008:<br />This is a poll of the general public.</p>
<p><em>With much of the country worried about the state of the economy, many (67%) Americans say they now closely follow news about US trade policy with foreign countries. Americans see the current trade policy as a reason for the economic woes the US is currently facing.<br />Almost 7 in 10 (68%) Americans believe international trade benefits other countries more than it benefits the United States.<br />International trade is seen as having a largely negative impact on American workers (78% negative) and the Untied States as a whole (63%).<br />Eight in ten Americans (79%) feel the US Government has not done enough to help workers who have lost their jobs to increased foreign competition. A majority of Americans would support the following proposed policies aimed at helping workers who have lost their jobs to foreign competition and outsourcing:</em><br /><em>Policies with the greatest amount of support include: providing special training programs (90% support), providing tax incentives for companies to relocate to areas where workers have lost their jobs because of foreign imports (84%), allowing imports only from countries that ban child labor (82% support), and allowing imports from countries that meet certain clean air and water standards (78% support).<br />About two-thirds (64%) of Americans are willing to pay more to keep down foreign competition.</em></p>
<p>There is a disconnect in the above responses. 90% want training, but in another question about boosting the economy, 41% opposed extending unemployment benefits. Though 67% support public works projects. This shows me that the public has not made the connections between our current trade environment and the economy. But, how about that 64% would pay more to keep down foreign competition. Can you get a more patriotic response? I don&#8217;t think the Republican&#8217;s had this kind of patriotism in mind.</p>
<p>When it comes to China:<br /><em>Where a product is manufactured does not impact Americans&#8217; purchasing decisions except when that product is made in China.<br />Nearly three-in-five (57%) Americans are less likely to buy a product if it is made in China.<br />When products are manufactured in other areas, such as Eastern Europe (57%), Western Europe (55%), Canada (53%), India (52%), Africa (51%), Mexico (48%), Japan (47%), and South Korea (46%) nearly a majority say it doesn&#8217;t matter.<br /></em><br />I can &#8216;t imagine that people are specifically boycotting Chinese made goods. Walmart et al would be in trouble. I think this is more of a gut response.</p>
<p>Over all, the public is waking up and seems more sophisticated in their understanding than I believe the Beltway crowd is willing to accept.  But, I believe some work needs to be done so that they connect the dots of the US economy as a function of trade policy.  I would like to see a de-emphasis of the fear and a disconnecting of foreign trade equals free trade policy. I really don&#8217;t believe anyone is against trading, they just have a major problem with the current rules and the referees.</p>
