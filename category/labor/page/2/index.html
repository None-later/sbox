                                <p>By Daniel Becker</p>
<p>I just want to lay out the debate going on in our economy right now. There are 4 debaters. President Obama/Geithner et al, President Obama 2008, the rich (or capitalist, those who make their money from money) and the rest of us. </p>
<p>From President Obama&#8217;s <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/07/60minutes/main7032277.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody">60 Minute interview</a>: </p>
<p>
<blockquote>PRESIDENT OBAMA:&#8230;And it turns out that actually the people who are most likely to use that money and spend that money are actually people of more modest means, and if what we&#8217;re concerned about is how we can grow the economy, there are more efficient ways to recirculate dollars out there and get people to spend.</p>
<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA:&#8230;But probably the biggest uncertainty right now for a lotta companies is there gonna be enough demand out there for the products, and we&#8217;ve gotta make sure that we&#8217;re workin&#8217; with them to try to improve that. </p>
<p>KROFT: You&#8217;ve got a situation right now that banks have not significantly loosened up credit in spite of all the money that they&#8217;ve received, in spite of the fact that they&#8217;re quite profitable right now. And you&#8217;ve got manufacturing companies that haven&#8217;t replaced many of the jobs or hired back the people that they&#8217;ve cut. How do you get the banks to loan money, and how do you get businesses to hire people back? </p>
<p>PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, it starts with businesses wanting to hire people back because they see customers out there. And so everything that we can do to expand consumer confidence, everything that we can do to get businesses to invest in plants and equipment through the tax code, through accelerated depreciation, through keeping taxes on middle class families where they are, as opposed to having them spike up &#8212; all that can make a difference. The more companies are doing well, the more likely they are to go to banks and say, &#8220;We need to borrow.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The two Obama&#8217;s are struggling to have it both ways and thus the lack of action on issues such as easing unionization while going to <a href="http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/801-economy/127651-ford-slams-south-korea-trade-deal-as-obama-officials-renew-talks">South Korea for a trade deal</a> ala <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/106607-south-korean-trade-deal-pits-obama-against-labor-">NAFTA</a>. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />However, the other 2 parties in this debate have been very clear for years now. I present “<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102609/quotes">Other People&#8217;s Money” 1991</a> </p>
<p>The Capitalist represented by Lawrence Garfield:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>&#8220;Ah, but we can&#8217;t,&#8221; goes the prayer. &#8220;We can&#8217;t because we have responsibility, a responsibility to our employees, to our community. What will happen to them?&#8221; I got two words for that: Who cares? Care about them? Why? They didn&#8217;t care about you. They sucked you dry. You have no responsibility to them. For the last ten years this company bled your money. Did this community ever say, &#8220;We know times are tough. We&#8217;ll lower taxes, reduce water and sewer.&#8221; Check it out: You&#8217;re paying twice what you did ten years ago. And our devoted employees, who have taken no increases for the past three years, are still making twice what they made ten years ago; and our stock &#8211; one-sixth what it was ten years ago. Who cares? I&#8217;ll tell you. Me. I&#8217;m not your best friend. I&#8217;m your only friend. I don&#8217;t make anything? I&#8217;m making you money. And lest we forget, that&#8217;s the only reason any of you became stockholders in the first place. You want to make money! You don&#8217;t care if they manufacture wire and cable, fried chicken, or grow tangerines! You want to make money! I&#8217;m the only friend you&#8217;ve got. I&#8217;m making you money. Take the money. Invest it somewhere else. Maybe, maybe you&#8217;ll get lucky and it&#8217;ll be used productively. And if it is, you&#8217;ll create new jobs and provide a service for the economy and, God forbid, even make a few bucks for yourselves. And if anybody asks, tell &#8217;em ya gave at the plant. And by the way, it pleases me that I am called &#8220;Larry the Liquidator.&#8221; You know why, fellow stockholders? Because at my funeral, you&#8217;ll leave with a smile on your face and a few bucks in your pocket. Now that&#8217;s a funeral worth having! </p></blockquote>
<p>The rest of us represented by Andrew Jorgenson:</p>
<blockquote><p>“&#8230;The entrepreneur of post-industrial America, playing God with other people&#8217;s money. The robber barons of old at least left something tangible in their wake- a coal mine, a railroad, banks. This man leaves nothing. He creates nothing. He builds nothing. He runs nothing. And in his wake lies nothing but a blizzard of paper to cover the pain. Oh, if he said, &#8220;I know how to run your business better than you,&#8221; that would be something worth talking about. But he&#8217;s not saying that. He&#8217;s saying, &#8220;I&#8217;m gonna kill you because at this particular moment in time, you&#8217;re worth more dead than alive.&#8221; Well, maybe that&#8217;s true, but it is also true that one day this industry will turn. One day when the yen is weaker, the dollar is stronger, or when we finally begin to rebuild our roads, our bridges, the infrastructure of our country, demand will skyrocket&#8230;.God save us if we vote to take his paltry few dollars and run. God save this country if that is truly the wave of the future. We will then have become a nation that makes nothing but hamburgers, creates nothing but lawyers, and sells nothing but tax shelters. And if we are at that point in this country, where we kill something because at the moment it&#8217;s worth more dead than alive, well, take a look around. Look at your neighbor. Look at your neighbor. You won&#8217;t kill him, will you? No. It&#8217;s called murder, and it&#8217;s illegal. Well, this, too, is murder, on a mass scale. Only on Wall Street, they call it maximizing shareholder value, and they call it legal. And they substitute dollar bills where a conscience should be. Damn it! A business is worth more than the price of its stock. It&#8217;s the place where we earn our living, where we meet our friends, dream our dreams. It is, in every sense, the very fabric that binds our society together. So let us now, at this meeting, say to every Garfield in the land, here, we build things, we don&#8217;t destroy them. Here, we care about more than the price of our stock. Here, we care about people. Thank you.”</p></blockquote>

                                <p>I present an update on aggregate demand using the highest frequency of economic data available, US Treasury tax receipts. Tax receipts serve as a proxy for nominal aggregate demand via a nominal indicator of private payroll growth.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fms.treas.gov/dts/index.html">US daily Treasury tax receipts </a>are improving. (This chart has been modified since its original posting to enable reader to click to enlarge).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TMRIScXWCMI/AAAAAAAADTk/9hhAOvtI2aU/s1600/US_Treasury_Receipt_chart.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TMRIScXWCMI/AAAAAAAADTk/9hhAOvtI2aU/s400/US_Treasury_Receipt_chart.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><a name="more"></a>The chart illustrates the federal deposits of income and employment taxes that are recorded on a daily basis and presented here as the annual pace of the 30-day rolling sum. The red line illustrates the average annual growth rate spanning the period 2005-current.</p>
<p>Since roughly April of 2010, the annual pace of income and employment tax receipts has been above the average, 2.8%. In the third quarter, the annual pace of income and employment tax receipts remained around 4%, consistent with the second quarter pace. Hours and employment are improving, supporting wage gains and higher tax receipts. But more importantly, the pace of tax receipt growth has not faltered, demonstrating ongoing recovery in the labor market and consumer demand.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s not enough. The gains in tax receipts are likely a function of firms adding back hours instead of pumping up the work force. (see my previous post with links on the &#8220;<a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/06/hourless-recovery.html">hourless recovery</a>&#8220;).</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TMNHed_SEHI/AAAAAAAADTU/0GMBq9jW0oU/s1600/hours_payroll_chart.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TMNHed_SEHI/AAAAAAAADTU/0GMBq9jW0oU/s400/hours_payroll_chart.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart above illustrates the cyclical loss from recession and gains during the recovery of private net-jobs (payroll) and aggregate weekly hours (you can see the summary data from the September payroll report <a href="http://bls.gov/news.release/empsit.a.htm">here</a>).</p>
<p>Both series found a trough in the third quarter of 2009, which is consistent with the bottom in tax receipt growth (chart above). However, the hours index has recovered quicker than has its payroll counterpart (of course it fell farther, too). To date, both private hours and payroll are 7% short of their values at the peak of the economic cycle.</p>
<p>Receipts are growing, but not vigorously enough to indicate any shift in the current trajectory of payroll growth. Therefore, nominal aggregate demand remains weak. Furthermore, the still-nascent household deleveraging cycle is very likely moving at snail-speed (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/04/reducing-household-financial-leverage.html">see this article for a discussion of the link between consumption growth, income growth, and deleveraging</a> for today&#8217;s commentary).</p>

                                <p>The kids in the next town over don’t.  Indeed, the place where my Eldest Daughter’s swim team practices is closed because it’s a holiday, and their schools are.  But not here: the banks are closed, the government offices are closed, the local libraries are closed. (Heck, the New York Public Library is closed.)  But the schools are open.
<p>For more than three years, the teachers worked without a contract.  While the Administration grew—and paid itself <em>very </em>well, taking an ever-increasing share of the budget—the teacher showed good faith.  They continued to negotiate, continued not to strike.  It wasn’t until the third year that they started cutting back on the extra effort they put in—things such as displaying children’s art projects in the hallways&#8211;.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Finally, two years ago, a contract agreement was reached.  One of the things no one bothered to specify—since the schools are public, and therefore a government institution—was that Federal and State holidays would not be school days.  The teachers might work some of them—teachers, as with most academics, do more work outside of the classroom (in preparation, in training, in research) than in it, so there might be a training day on some of the minor ones—but there would not be classes.  No Administration would be crazy enough to schedule classes on a Federal holiday, when many of the parents would have planned three-day weekends.</p>
<p>Except ours, to punish the teachers for having the temerity to negotiate for a contract, would do exactly that.  And it has for the past few years.</p>
<p>While taking my usual walk from Penn Station to Times Square, I saw more than the usual amount of tourists: a marginal effect of the holiday, as economists would note.  And that marginal effect is marginally reduced by the families whose children had to go to school today, even though their parents have the day off.  By the Law of Large Numbers, economists won’t even notice the difference—though individual stores and businesses might.</p>
<p>Columbus Day may be a minor Federal holiday. An NCIS “Undercover Marathon” on the USA network does not a unique celebration make.  And explaining why it is a holiday may become problematic. (“Well, <a href="http://open.salon.com/blog/keka/2010/10/10/white_men_with_guns" target="_blank">white men with guns</a> came here because like most men they were really lousy at asking for directions. And unlike the previous white men, they stayed, more or less.” is so much less doggerel or open to misinterpretation than “In 1493, Columbus sailed the Deep Blue Sea.”)  But explaining that the kids have to go to school, not the beach, because the superintendent wants to punish the teachers and the kids are collateral damage, well, that’s an economics lesson that will abide.</p>
<p>Especially when you tell them the punch line: Despite more than containing teacher expenses, the school budget has exploded for the past several years as more and more Administrators have been paid more and more money. And the result of this is that the Superintendent who is responsible for that got a five-year contract extension, bloating the budget even more, with even less of it allocated to children’s education (since the Superintendent is a Fixed Cost).</p>
<p>From there, explaining the growth of income inequality is at worst a lay-up.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TJthUF499LI/AAAAAAAABW4/-twYgIWUwJ0/s1600/Clipboard01+profits.bmp"><br /></a><br />Labor cost as a share of business output is now at a post WW &#8211; II low. and has fallen about eight percentage points since 2000.  This would suggest that the weak demand for labor does not stem from high labor cost.  Actually since the third quarter of 2000 while labor cost as a share of total business cost has plunged, private payroll employment has also  fallen from 111.2 million to 107.6 million in the second quarter of 2010.  Yes, this data contradicts the theory taught in introductory economics.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TJTjN0LVOxI/AAAAAAAABWY/WamrwE0ycHk/s1600/Clipboard01+labor+share.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TJTjN0LVOxI/AAAAAAAABWY/WamrwE0ycHk/s320/Clipboard01+labor+share.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />But, if as this data series implies that weak employment is not because of high labor cost why should further cuts in labor cost via a cut in the payroll tax lead firms to hire more employees?   I strongly suspect that those advocating cutting the payroll tax simply remember the  theory they learned in their introductory economics class and have never actually looked at the data.  If they had they would know that changes in the demand for labor and changes in labor compensation have a strong positive correlation.  Of course this directly contradicts the theory they learned in introductory economics that labor demand is a downward sloping function of labor compensation.  But remember, that theory is simply a massive over-simplification used to explain  basic  economic concepts to some  teenagers.  The theory assumes that all other things are constant and in reality that never really happens.  In reality, the demand for labor is a function of many things of which labor compensation is only one factor and generally a relatively minor factor at that.  In the real world the demand curve for labor is not a downward sloping function of compensation. Remember, when Alfred Marshall the great economist who did more to develop graphical analysis than anyone else was asked why he developed this approach his answer was,&#8221;so the gentlemen in the back row can understand what I&#8217;m talking about&#8221;.</p>
<p>Labor demand is a derived demand.  Firms hire labor because they think they can profitably sell the goods and/or services the labor produces not because they derive some utility from hiring labor.  Consequently, the dominant factor in the demand for labor is the firms perception of the demand for that firms output.  Even if the cost of labor falls, firms still will not hire more labor to produce more output if the firms does not expect to sell the expanded output. Consequently, those claiming that cutting labor cost will induce firms to hire more labor are just spouting some ideological fantasy that has no basis in reality or even in advanced economic theory.</p>
<p>So what drives the demand for labor.  If I want to forecast employment I make it a simple estimate of GDP less productivity.  In this estimate labor cost does not play a enter the equation at all.  In my experience labor costs is only important in the labor supply equation where higher labor payments induce individuals to enter the labor force.</p>
<p>In response to questions in the comments that if labor&#8217;s share fell, what rose, I&#8217;ve added this chart.<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TJthUF499LI/AAAAAAAABW4/-twYgIWUwJ0/s1600/Clipboard01+profits.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TJthUF499LI/AAAAAAAABW4/-twYgIWUwJ0/s320/Clipboard01+profits.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />PS.  The last time I published this chart it was of an index number that was derived by dividing one index number by another.  So anyone could download the  data from the BLS and reproduce it.  But this chart is of the actual raw data that shows labor cost as an actual share of business output. BLS does not publish this raw data.  Haver Analytics made special arrangements to get the raw data from the  BLS so they could generate this data series.  Consequently you will not be able to reproduce this data series from publicly available data.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>

<p>Business Insider offers <a target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-real-problem-with-labor-unions-2010-9#ixzz0ylUHWb1H">one sort of opinion</a> by Mike Shedlock&#8230; what I can gather from the short article are the implications that outsourcing over the globe is a consequence of unions, that we should be more like Louisiana, and there is no economic literature on labor to offer some alternative explanations.  And serves notice to public employee unions of what is next&#8230;you privileged workers are next after we finish off what is left of the private unions.  Really nice offering.</p>
<p>Now this particular effort might reflect some lack of understanding on the unions part, but absolves any decision by Cessna management for stupid decisions it appears. Be afraid is the message. </p>
<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s  the deal. The Hises and the union in general appear ready willing and  able to &#8220;hurt the whole Wichita economy&#8221; if they do not get what they  want.</p>
<p>I have to ask &#8220;How stupid is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>The answer is &#8220;tremendously stupid&#8221;.</p>
<p>It  is far better to have a good paying job and no job security than no job  at all and no prospects of a job. That&#8217;s what it boils down to, and  like it or not, that is the economic reality.</p>
<p>I do not know what  salaries are, but a 10 year contract with only a 4.2% pay cut does not  strike me as a bad deal. Those who think otherwise need to compare it to  the alternative: seeing all the jobs go to Louisiana, Mississippi, or  outside the country.</p>
<p>By the way, wouldn&#8217;t residents of Louisiana  and Mississippi be very grateful for those job, regardless of what the  salary was? I think so. So the bottom line is this mess, is the unions  would be to blame and only the unions to blame if Cessna moves  elsewhere. The union will also be <a itxtdid="24403337" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/heres-the-real-problem-with-labor-unions-2010-9#" classname="iAs">responsible</a> for wrecking the entire local economy if it happens.</p>
<p>Take  the contract and run! It&#8217;s for 10 years! Because &#8230;. You Don&#8217;t Know  What You&#8217;ve Lost Till Its Gone, Then It&#8217;s Too Late. In this case, it  will be gone forever.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>GIIPS labour costs not moving in the &#8220;competitive&#8221; direction</strong><br />The GIIPS (Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain) hope: exports. Fiscal austerity crimps the saving of the private sector. And <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/10162176.stm">provided the governments make good their plans</a> to put on the fiscal straight-jacket, there’s no other impetus for growth except foreign demand. Financial crises are often accompanied by currency crises, i.e., <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2008/wp08224.pdf">Sweden 1991</a>, which drives export growth if there is sufficient external demand. For Sweden, there was.</p>
<p>For the GIIPS, there is not. But worse yet, there&#8217;s not a possibility of a currency crisis deep enough to drive sufficient external demand growth in Greece, Italy, Ireland, Portugal, and Spain. Therefore, it’s generally understood that the GIIPS will get the economic boost if internal competitiveness is restored. Put another way, in lieu of a domestic impetus to economic growth, &#8220;internal devaluation” (Marshall Auerback calls it <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/2010/05/19/latvias-infernal-devaluation-11026/">“infernal devaluation”</a>), i.e, dropping hourly labor costs and final goods prices through productivity gains and reform, is the only economic means to attract a sufficient boost of external income to grow the economy.</p>
<p>Well, internal labour cost devaluation has yet to materialize in the GIIPS or the Eurozone as a whole. According to last week’s Eurostat release of Q1 2010 <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/3-16062010-AP/EN/3-16062010-AP-EN.PDF">quarterly labour costs for the European Union</a>, labour costs are still very much rising:<br />
<blockquote>The two main components of labour costs are wages &#038; salaries and non-wage costs. In the euro area, wages &#038; salaries per hour worked grew by 2.0% in the year up to the first quarter of 2010, and the non-wage component by 2.1%, compared with 1.6% and 2.0% respectively for the fourth quarter of 2009. In the EU27, hourly wages &#038; salaries rose by 2.3% and the non-wage component by 1.9% in the year up to the first quarter of 2010, compared with 1.9% and 2.5% respectively for the previous quarter.</p></blockquote>
<p>There is a lag associated with labor cost growth, especially in Europe. But over the last two years, the Eurozone 16 saw labour costs rise a cumulative 5.3%, which is on par with the previous two-year horizon, 5.7%; labour cost growth isn&#8217;t even slowing.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TCJpt2agtCI/AAAAAAAADIg/apbyFkk72EQ/s1600/Eurozone_LC_Newsneconomics.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TCJpt2agtCI/AAAAAAAADIg/apbyFkk72EQ/s400/Eurozone_LC_Newsneconomics.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>(this chart was updated at 4:00pm on June 23)</p>
<p>The chart illustrates the two-year cumulative labour cost gains across the Eurozone 16 (seasonally and working-day adjusted) alongside the annual gains over the last year (working-day adjusted only). Note: country-level data for Ireland, Finland are not available. Furthermore, country-level data through Q1 2010 are not available for Belgium, Italy, and Greece, so Q4 2009 is used instead.</p>
<p>According to the measure of &#8220;labour costs&#8221;, it appears that “competitiveness” is not improving markedly in any country across the Eurozone, especially in the GIIPS that need it. In contrast, US nonfarm business unit labor costs <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/ULCNFB/downloaddata?cid=2">dropped 4.2% over the last two years</a>.</p>
<p>To be sure, there are other measures of “infernal devaluation”, like final goods prices. But strictly speaking labour costs remain too sticky in the Eurozone to attract external demand sufficient enough to offset the drag that would stem from the announced <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/10162176.stm">fiscal tightening across Europe</a>.</p>

                                <p>It took me many years to understand the phrase &#8220;moral hazard.&#8221;  It&#8217;s a fundamental tenet of economics, usually used to explain that, since consumers are untrustworthy, businesses need to charge them more.*</p>
<p>It was finally cleared up for me in the midst of a presentation last year about how it&#8217;s a &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; issue that divorce rates go up as more women work outside of the house/family business. So I asked the presenter, &#8220;You mean it&#8217;s a moral hazard issue that women who have an independent income can now get out of an abusive relationship?&#8221;</p>
<p>Fortunately, one of the best Labor Economists in the world was in the room.  He just looked up and said, &#8220;Or guys start leaving their wives because the wife can go to work now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aha!  The light dawns: moral hazard is, indeed, about power relationships: it allows arseholes to be even greater arseholes.  (One step further, and you start spouting Ayn Rand.)</p>
<p>Preceding is preamble to correcting <a target="_blank" href="http://www.philly.com/dailynews/local/20091104_Pension___seen_as_ticket_to_end_SEPTA_picket.html">an error made by a worker in today&#8217;s <em>Phialdelphia Daily News</em></a> (h/t Dr. Black, of course):<br />
<blockquote>Yesterday, Local 234 President Willie Brown said that the wage package was acceptable but that he was worried about the underfunded pension fund, funded only 52 percent. He said he believed that SEPTA had not contributed to it for 10 to 12 years&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could wake up and our pension could be completely gone,&#8221; [Brown] said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want to end up like AIG,&#8221; referring to the international insurance giant who got $173 billion since last fall in a U.S. government bailout.</p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Brown should not worry about that.  AIG&#8217;s creditors (e.g., The Great Vampire Squid) were paid in full, because Tim Geithner and Larry Summers want a veto-proof Republican majority by 2012, if not 2010.**</p>
<p>Pensioners, otoh, are subject to &#8220;moral hazard.&#8221;  Believing their contracts were viable, reasonable, and negotiated by people who were working in the best interest of the firm—that is, people who were not writing a check with their mouth that their pockets couldn&#8217;t cash—clearly causes them not to do enough to save.  Because they don&#8217;t understand that mismanagement of their pension is <em>their fault</em>, and that the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation will only ensure that their pensions will be paid &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.pbgc.gov/workers-retirees/auto-sector.html">up to certain limits</a>,&#8221; no matter how much extra Roger Smith or Michael Eisner or Jack Welch took from the company for <a target="_blank" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/jack-welch-and-the-lone-ranger-theory/?apage=2">performing almost as well as the rest of the stock market</a>.</p>
<p>So, let us say to Mr. Brown and the rest of the workers who depend on their pensions being funded: Don&#8217;t worry about being treated the way AIG was.  You&#8217;re going to be dealt with as a &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; problem for believing that the contract you negotiated will be enforced.</p>
<p>Why, if those workers were at all sensible, they would have taken the money upfront the way those Captains of Industry did, instead of gotten a false sense of security (&#8220;moral hazard&#8221;) from contractual negotiations about future payments.</p>
<p>As noted by Dr. Black, while management claims that they are fulfilling their legal obligations, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/20091106_How_the_pension_fund_figures_in_SEPTA_strike.html">management&#8217;s pension fund is almost 25% better funded than the workers fund</a> (53% v 65%).</p>
<p>This is, of course, A Good Thing.  After all, we wouldn&#8217;t want workers to believe that what they think of as Contractual Obligations is anything other than a case of &#8220;moral hazard.&#8221;</p>
<p>UPDATE: I see, via David Wessel&#8217;s Twitter feed, that <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/11/05/economy-had-a-heart-attack-and-defibrillators-are-scarce/#">Ricardo Caballero puts forth standard Economics Reasoning</a>:<br />
<blockquote>His idea is likely to give heartburn to many economists and policy makers, who worry about “moral hazard” — the idea that if financial institutions know they’ll be saved in an emergency, they’ll take even greater risks that will inevitably lead to greater disasters.</p>
<p>Don’t fret, says Mr. Caballero: “this moral hazard perspective is the equivalent of discouraging the placement of defibrillators in public places because of the concern that, upon seeing them, people would have a sudden urge to consume cheeseburgers.”</p></blockquote>
<p>After all, we just have to acknowledge that &#8220;moral hazard&#8221; exemptions are the rule, not the exception, for mismanaged businesses.  After all, paying out more in bonuses than you make in a year is a <a target="_blank" href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/02/banker-bonus-rain/?scp=1&#038;sq=bonus&#038;st=cse">Perfectly Reasonable Business Strategy</a>.</p>
<p>*Seriously. The standard example is that people &#8220;don&#8217;t tell the whole truth&#8221; on health insurance applications, so companies <strong>need</strong> to charge them more.  The logical extension of this is that people who tell the whole truth are leaving money on the table, since no insurance company would <em>ever</em> take an <em>ex poste</em> action against people who omit or forget that sprained ankle from thirty years ago.  For an alternate view, see <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/08/29/050829fa_fact">Malcolm Gladwell</a>.</p>
<p>**There <em>may</em> be an alternate explanation, but this one requires the fewest outlandish assumptions.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuiGsMYdZ7I/AAAAAAAAA7s/F6jjMdO3YY8/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg">=</a><br />By Spencer,</p>
<p>The issue of a jobless recovery is getting a lot of attention recently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found the best way to look at the issue is to compare the change in real growth and productivity over the long run. There have been three periods of different productivity trends in modern US economic history.</p>
<p>Prior to about 1973 productivity growth averaged 2.8%. In the second or low productivity era, running from 1974 to 1995, productivity growth slowed to 1.5% before rebounding to 2.4% since 1995.</p>
<p>But real GDP growth also slowed over this period. As a consequence, the ratio of real GDP growth to productivity growth fell from 68% in the early strong productivity  to 50% in the weak productivity era before rebounding to over 80% in the most recent era.  Basically, real GDP growth equals productivity growth plus hours worked or employment growth.  A consequence of stronger productivity in an era of weaker GDP growth this suggests that each percentage point increase in real GDP growth generates a much weaker increase in hours worked or employment. Currently, a percentage point increase in real GDP growth now generates under a 0.2 percentage point increase in hours worked versus 0.3 in the pre-1974 era and 0.5 percentage points in the low productivity era.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuhO_5PuwAI/AAAAAAAAA7k/8V_qlBkAdd4/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuhO_5PuwAI/AAAAAAAAA7k/8V_qlBkAdd4/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>But to a certain extent comparing productivity and real GDP is comparing apples to oranges. To be accurate one should look at productivity versus output in the nonfarm sector.  GDP includes the farm sector of course, but also the nonprofit and government sectors where productivity is assumed to be zero.</p>
<p>If you look at what happened in the 1990s and early 2000s recoveries in the nonfarm business sector, you see that productivity growth significantly outpaced output growth in the early recovery phase of the cycle.  As a consequence hours worked or employment fell, generating the jobless recoveries.  It looks like the problem in these two cycles was much weaker growth rather than strong productivity.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuddkSTaLJI/AAAAAAAAA7c/LadRuyeV83Q/s1600-h/Clipboard03.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuddkSTaLJI/AAAAAAAAA7c/LadRuyeV83Q/s320/Clipboard03.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />This shift to an environment of stronger productivity and weaker real growth generated an interesting development that has received little attention among economists or in the business press.</p>
<p>This development was a secular decline in labor&#8217;s share of the pie.  Prior to the 1982 recession there was a strong cyclical pattern of labor&#8217;s  but it was around a long term or secular  flat trend.  But since the early 1980s labor&#8217;s share of the pie has fallen sharply by about ten percentage points.  Note that the chart is of labor compensation divided by nominal output indexed to 1992 = 100. That is because the data for each series is reported as an index number at 1992=100 rather than in dollar terms. So the scale is set to 1992 =100 rather than in percentage points.  But it still shows that labor payments as a share of nonfarm business total ouput has declined sharply over the last 20 years and prior to the latest cycle we did not even see the normal late cycle uptick in labor&#8217;s share.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuddUhLWUaI/AAAAAAAAA7M/iU2gefk317M/s1600-h/Clipboard01.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/SuddUhLWUaI/AAAAAAAAA7M/iU2gefk317M/s320/Clipboard01.jpg" alt="" border="0"></a><br />If this chart gets a lot of attention it will be interesting to see how the libertarian and/or conservative analysts who keep coming up with all types of excuses to explain away the weakness in real labor compensation in recent years  explain this away.  If you really want to raise a stink you could look at this as a great example of the Marxist immiseration of labor that Marx believed was one of the internal contradictions of capitalism that would eventually lead to its self destruction.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure whether (more likely wherE) this has been noted in the literature, but wage differentials not due to differences in workers&#8217; skill are enough to generate a business cycle.  A verbal &#8220;model&#8221; after the jump.</p>
<p>update: additional model with fixed capital added.</p>
<p>The key reference from which this is not quite obvious is <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1831884">Kevin Murphy Andrei Shleifer and Robert Vishny (1989) &#8220;Industrialization and the Big Push&#8221; Journal of Political Economy vol 97 pp 1003-</a> which contains three models only one of which is The Big Push.  Another discusses wage differentials not due to worker characteristics.  Since Murphy is one of the authors, they are assumed to be compensating differentials not labor market rents but it doesn&#8217;t matter (except for welfare analysis).</p>
<p>OK the problem:  Assume that workers all have the same skill yet different wages are paid in different industries.  Can this imply multiple Pareto ranked steady states ? Can this imply that there are sunspot equilibria in which GNP changes just because people expect it to change ?   </p>
<p>To make the problem hard, assume that everyone is rational, that there is perfect competition (except for the wage differentials) and that all goods are non durable so consumption must equal production and the real interest rate just makes aggregate demand equal aggregate supply.</p>
<p>The last assumption is needed, because a model with two sectors can have a sunspot equilibrium due to the effect of (spontaneous just because people expect it) sectoral shifts on the real interest rate (Boldrin and Rusticchini in Econometrica).  I find models which rely on the effect of changes in the real interest rate on the rate of growth of aggregate consumption or labor supply to be unconvincing as there is almost exactly no sign of such effects in the data (that criticism applies to 3 published papers with my name on them).</p>
<p>OK the &#8220;model.&#8221;    Time is continuous.  People are free to borrow and save at interest rate r.  They have a rate of time preference rho</p>
<p>There is no capital.  There are two non-durable goods produced with labor alone.  There is nothing odd about good 1.  One unit of it is produced with 1 unit of labor. </p>
<p>1) C_1 = L_1</p>
<p>where C_1 is consumption of good 1 and L_1 is employment in the sector which produces good 1.</p>
<p>The price of good 1 is normalized to 1.  There is perfect competition so w_1 (the wage paid in sector 1) is equal to 1.</p>
<p>One unit of labor is needed to produce good 2</p>
<p>2) C_2 = L_2</p>
<p>total labor supply is fixed L_1+L_2 = L</p>
<p>However for some reason (it&#8217;s ok except for the welfare analysis if its a comepensating differential, that is it is more unpleasant to work in sector 2) </p>
<p>3) w_2= a > 1</p>
<p>there is perfect competition so the price of good 2 P_2 = a.</p>
<p>update 5: I am assuming that each individual worker moonlights working in both sectors and that they all spend the same fraction of their time in each sector.  In other words I am making assumptions so that all individuals have exactly the same income.  This is silly but makes things simpler.</p>
<p>Now a knife edge very special case for clarity.  The goods are perfect substitutes</p>
<p>U = aC_2+C_1</p>
<p>This means that any C_2+C_1 = L can be a steady state equilibrium.  </p>
<p>Welfare equals (L + (a-1)C_2)/rho = (aL-(a-1)C_1).</p>
<p>For this knife edge special case, there are a continuum of Pareto ranked steady state equilibria.  People are better off if they work in sector 2.  Any number can work in sector 2.</p>
<p>Well that&#8217;s an extreme example.  Now how about this one Good_1 is an inferior good.  This means that for fixed relative prices (and relative prices must be fixed) there is an interval of total consumption over which consumption of good 1 declines.   </p>
<p>update 3:  I think I was totally confused here <strike><br />update:  Assumption immediately below is a correction of the assumption in an earlier version.  Sad to say the new assumption is the assumption which I hate.</p>
<p>Consumption/permanent income decreases as the interest rate increases </strike></p>
<p>permanent income is the expected discounted value of the flow of income.  Call it pY.</p>
<p>Oh no now I need a graph.</p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/?action=view&#038;current=YC_1.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/YC_1.jpg" border="0" alt="figure 1"></a></p>
<p>Consider possible steady states.  Consider income and consumption of good 1.  The line shows income as a function of consumption (and production) of good 1 . The curve shows consumption of good 1 as a function of pY.</p>
<p>Note there are two steady states and one is Pareto better than the other (C_2 is higher).</p>
<p>OK now figure 2 shows Y as a function of pY.  </p>
<p><a href="http://smg.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/?action=view&#038;current=YpY.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v296/rjw88/YpY.jpg" border="0" alt="figure 2"></a></p>
<p>Define total consumption as C = C_1+aC_2</p>
<p>So there are two steady states one with high output Yg and the other with low output which I will call Yb.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s more the economy can jump from one to the other.  let&#8217;s say it switches according to a poisson alarm clock with the sunspot causing a switch arriving at rate p.  Or hell let&#8217;s say time is discrete and they switch each period with probability p.</p>
<p>In each steady state consumption equals to income so that the identity C=Y and the equations which give C_1 and C_2 as a function of y (for P_2 fixed and equal to a from the supply side) and Y as a function of C_1 and C_2 both hold.</p>
<p>Furthermore the economy can jump stochastically from one to the other.  How ?  Well lets say we are in the good state.  The national income identity means C=Y.  However individuals are free to borrow and save at interest rate r.  They decide consumption given permanent income.  This means that r can&#8217;t equal rho.  They know that their income might fall so if y=Yg all agents will try to save if r=rho.  They can&#8217;t.  we must have C=Y because there is no way to invest.  </p>
<p>So r must be lower than rho.  This means that they are satisfied if the expected marginal utility of consumption increases.  It does it jumps up to the higher marginal utility of consumption in the bad steady state with rate p.  For any p r can be calculated so that people neither want to borrow nor save if they are currently at the good steady state.</p>
<p>Similarly at the bad steady state.  Here r must be greater than rho since income and consumption might jump up.  </p>
<p>update 4:  Now I add capital to the model.  The model above is very strange as there is no fixed capital or trade so consumption must always be equal to production.  Also one of the stylized facts about wages, and, in particular, wages which are surprisingly high given worker characteristics is that they are high in industries with a high capital labor ratio.  In the model above, both industries have a capital labor ratio of 0.</p>
<p>So now there is a third good K in addition to C_1 and C_2.  At any given time total capital equals K = K_1+K_2 where K_i is capital used in sector i. Y_1 and Y_2 are production of each type of good no longer equal to C_1 and C_2.  Y = Y_1+Y_2 and C=C_1+C_2</p>
<p>The assumption about wages becomes</p>
<p>5) w_2 = (w_1)a</p>
<p>since now wages depend on the capital labor ratio.</p>
<p>I will assume that the share of capital is constant and the same in each industry.  This means that the relative prices of the goods will be constant.  For further simplicity I am going to make assumptions so that constant is 1 so P_2 = P_1.  This is all for tractability and is not realistic.  In fact not only is K/L high in high wage industries but so is the share of capital (capital income)/wL which will be just rK/wL here.  But I assume that rK/wL = alpha in both sectors cause it makes things easier.  I equations I assume</p>
<p>5) y_1 = A(L_1)^(1-alpha)(K_1)^alpha</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>6) Y_2 = A(aL_2)^(1-alpha)(K_2)^alpha</p>
<p>So both sectors have similar Cobb-Douglas production functions.  For the same amount spent on labor and capital (which means fewer physical hours of work in industry 2 since each gets a higher wage) the sectors have the same output so the two goods are sold for the same price which I set to 1.   This makes everything relatively simple and means that the crude definitions like Y = Y_1+Y_2 make sense.</p>
<p>I want to keep things simple so I will assume that you can create 2 units of K from 1 unit of good 1 and one unit of good 2.  This is an absolutely rigid no substitution allowed leontief type function.  capital depreciates at rate delta.     so </p>
<p>5) dK/dt = -deltaK + 2min(Y_1-C_1,Y_2-C_2)</p>
<p>This means that </p>
<p>6) dK/dt = -deltaK + (Y-C)</p>
<p>and the price of one unit of capital is 1, that is equal to the price of one unit of consumption good 1 which is equal to the price of one unit of consumption good 2.</p>
<p>I assume that delta is high enough that no one ever wants to convert K back to consumption goods (or that they can do that which is silly but standard).  Also I assume either that delta is high enough that no one ever wants to take capital from sector 1 and add it to sector 2 or that this is possible.  Again silly but standard.</p>
<p>Note that a shift of labor from sector 1 to sector 2 will increase demand for capital and will give a higher marginal product of capital r for the same total amount of capital K.</p>
<p>Finally I will make an assumption about tastes.  For p_1/p_2 = 1 (which it must be given the supply side) C_1 and C_2 as a function of total consumption are given by figure 3.  As C goes up from zero the ratio C_2/C_1 is constant for a while, then C_2/C_1 increases then it is constant with a higher C_2/C_1.  </p>
<p>In the regions where C_2/C_1 doesn&#8217;t change with total consumption C, this model behaves just like a standard Solow model.  However, when C_2/C_1 is higher it is as if there has been labor augmenting technological progress since labor is more productive in sector 2. </p>
<p>Recall I am assuming all workers divide their time and work in both sectors and have equal identical income.  I also they are the saver/ investors and all have equal wealth so everyone always has the same income. Silly but standard in macro.</p>
<p>This means that, for the right a and assumptions about tastes, there can be two steady states again.  In each steady state the real interest rate is equal to the rate of time preference r=rho, but in the good steady state C_2/C_1 is higher than in the bad steady state so the K/L needed to make r=rho is higher and output is higher and consumption is higher so, given tastes the ratio C_2/C_1 is higher.<br />Define the two steady state levels of capital as Kg and Kb with Kg>Kb and may use the subscripts the same way for other variables.</p>
<p>It is no longer possible to jump from one steady state to another.  K is a state variable and changes slowly.  C can jump.</p>
<p>There is a sunspot equilibrium where the economy spends much of it&#8217;s time near one of the steady states.</p>
<p>If K is just above the good steady state K (Kg) then r<rho so the expected change in consumption must be negative. this happens equilibrium way. it is constant unless poisson alarm clock rings. if rings then jumps down that c region with a low c_2 means value of marginal utility rises as required r>rho.</p>
<p>If it jumps the economy finds itself on the path of dC/dt and dK/dt which leads to a point with K just below bad steady state K.  Once it gets real close to this point, the sunspot begins giving a jump up signal which arrives at rate p again.  This makes consumption remain constant if the jump up signal doesn&#8217;t arrive at a point where r>rho so K below Kb.</p>
<p>If the jump up signal arrives then C jumps up to the region with high constant C_2/C_1 to exactly the point where the dC/dt and dK/dt equations lead it to the original point with K a little bit greater than Kb.</p>
<p>Also now the economy can have much more complicated dynamics.  It is possible to make an equilibrium in which it can jump at any time and not just when close to a steady state.</p>
<p>update 3: I think everything below is totally confused</p>
<p><strike></p>
<p>Note again two steady states.  Also note that for the Pareto better steady state (with higher Y) dY/dpY >1.  This means that this steady state is a stable steady state with Y = Yg (for good).  if Y starts slightly above steady Yg then it will converge to steady Yg.  This means that there is a sunspot equilibrium in which Y bounces around Yg just because people expect it too (rational animal spirits).</p>
<p>update 2:  The assumption which I hate that, given permanent income, consumption decreases in the interest rate is not needed for there to be a stable steady state and sunspot equilibria.  It is just needed so that the good steady state is stable.  If, in contrast, consumption increases in the interest rate for given permanent income, then the bad steady state is stable.  There is a very general result that when you pass from zero steady states to two (as in the figure) then one of the steady states is stable and one is unstable.</p>
<p>I will attempt to discuss the dynamics of Y near a steady state.  I will use linear approximations (I have to do this to have any hope of writing out the explanation with plain ascii.  That approximation is not necessary for the result.</p>
<p>There are two steady states Yg defined above and the one with lower Y which I now name Yb.  </p>
<p>I will try to find the time derivative of Y, dY/dt for Y near a steady state.  If d(dY/dt)/dY is negative then when Y is above the steady state Y falls down to the steady state. This means that the steady state is a sink, it is stable.  It means that there are sunspot equilibria where the economy bounces around the steady state.</p>
<p>I will make an assumption about the utility function.  First define total consumption</p>
<p>C = C_1+aC_2</p>
<p>note that C=Y.</p>
<p>Given the relative price P_2 = 2P_1, C_1 and C_2 are functions of C.  </p>
<p>I assume that<br />the marginal utility of consumption of good 1 is equal to </p>
<p>4) U_1(C_1,C_2) = C^(-sigma) </p>
<p>This must be equal to (1/a) times the marginal utility of consumption of good 2.</p>
<p>Now consider the real interest rate r.  Even though there is no saving and investment, there is a market clearing r such that no one wants to save or borrow.<br />Equation 4 implies that </p>
<p>5) (dC/dt)/C = (r-rho)/sigma  = (dY/dt)/Y</p>
<p>(recall the national accounts identity is just C=Y).</p>
<p>now consider constant r (just for now)</p>
<p>permanent income at t (pY_t) is the integral as s goes from zero to infinity of exp(-rs)Y_(t+s)ds</p>
<p>Given 5 that equals the integral as s goes from zero to infinity of</p>
<p>exp(s(r(1-sigma)-rho)/sigma)Y_t so  </p>
<p>6) pY_t = Y_t(-sigma/(r(1-sigma)-rho))= Y_t(sigma/(rho+(sigma-1)r)</p>
<p>if r = rho then pY_t = Y_t(sigma/sigma) = Y_t</p>
<p>if sigma is greater than 1, then pY_t/Y_t decreases in r.  If sigma is less than one then pY_t/Y_t increases in r.  Let&#8217;s assume that sigma>1 (the assumption I like).  This means that Yb is a stable steady state.</p>
<p>OK so that wasn&#8217;t very hard, but the problem is that r_t changes as Y_t changes. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m working on it (update 3.1 not any more.  I realize I was assuming that there was some way to save.  <br /></strike></p>

<p>The BLS establishment survey (<a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t14.htm">nonfarm payroll</a>) reports that the accumulated job loss since December 2007 is 5.02% (almost 7 million jobs), blowing the total job loss of the previous &#8220;biggie&#8221; recessions, the 73-75 and 81-82 recessions, out of the water by 2.5% and 2%, respectively. There&#8217;s no question that it has been bad, with almost every industry slashing payroll.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqQOUg10LWI/AAAAAAAACfo/m-AySv6LmtU/s1600-h/accumulated_jobloss_chart.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqQOUg10LWI/AAAAAAAACfo/m-AySv6LmtU/s320/accumulated_jobloss_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart illustrates the total accumulated job loss across the major industries spanning December 2007 to August 2009 (nonfarm payroll listed <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t14.htm">here</a>). Assuming that the recession is over (the consensus and key indicators seem to indicate that a <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601068&#038;sid=aUPIThl8CVVQ">business cycle trough has been found</a>), then there are just two men left standing (adding jobs over the cycle), education and health services and government (barely). Even the historical job anchors , other services, professional and business services, and financial activities, are down between 1.8 and 8%! The job loss is broad and deep.</p>
<p>However, the industry contributions to total job loss show that the job destruction is heavily weighted in manufacturing and construction, which account for roughly half of the total drop in nonfarm payroll (-2.5% of the total -5%). But manufacturing and construction hold just a 16% share of the entire payroll.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqQGd9Hn_yI/AAAAAAAACfg/H7uvrxz7tf4/s1600-h/contributions_chart.png"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/SqQGd9Hn_yI/AAAAAAAACfg/H7uvrxz7tf4/s320/contributions_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>Productivity numbers, i.e., growing amid record output loss, would suggest (even <a href="http://www.bls.gov/news.release/prod2.nr0.htm">manufacturing productivity</a> saw growth in Q2 2009) that factories are running on skeleton crews, which is efficient given the drop in demand. And a resumption of aggregate demand may be partially satisfied by <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2009/08/can-firms-simply-add-hours-to-recover.html">adding hours</a>, but that will only go so far. Firms will need to hire, and hire soon after demand starts to grow again.</p>
