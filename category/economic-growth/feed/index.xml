				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I promise, there are numbers here, but lets have some fun first and write a screen play to set up the point.  It is long, but&#8230; 
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Dear, I&#8217;m getting nervous.  We seem to keep adding to how much money we owe and our income hasn&#8217;t changed for the better.  What can we do?&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>At this point of the conversation, the conservative ideology (Republican and Democratic Parties) suggests and encourages you to believe that the answer is something like: &#8220;Well Honey, as I look over the horizon I see no possibility for improving our current position.  The only thing we can do is cut back on our spending.  We have to stop spending on anything we don&#8217;t need to live.  If we are willing to sacrifice then eventually we&#8217;ll have savings that we can then use to invest such that we have more income.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, for most Americans at this moment in the euphemistically labeled &#8220;business cycle&#8221; Honey&#8217;s response would be: &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know where else we can cut!&#8221; Of course to the conservative there is always something that money is being spent on that is in actuality an indulgence for which one should repent and thus cut from their spending if said spending is greater than one&#8217;s income.  This is true because no righteous individual would ever let the devil of consumption tempt them from the path to wealth heaven.  Redeem one&#8217;s self through the power of restraint of consumption urges.</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>There are multiple things wrong with such a screenplay.  For instance, I&#8217;ve noted in the past that we really do not need banks.  You and I could do everything we want without a bank.  I could build a business even, without a bank.  Granted I could not build it as big and as fast as with working with a bank, but I could build one.  What the bank does is allow one to borrow against the future.  Lending allows the acceleration of the experience and results of the  movement of money.  Certainly that acceleration can result in a loss just as easily as a win, but then that is why we have all sorts of experts in money that can help one make the better odds beating decision such that the acceleration produces a win.  Dear is corrected in that they could do cuts and save and then take the next step.  It was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093936/" target="_blank">Howard Prescott&#8217;s</a> approach.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We&#8217;re talking about lending here.  Borrowing money.  It is accepted within that part of the conservative ideology which focuses on the concept of money that lending and borrowing are a given.  It is an indisputable fact that such activity exists, is righteous and good.  It is as much a part of the reality of life as oxygen is.  It is a fact of nature.  Nothing could ever be fully realized without lending and borrowing.  Nothing!  Thus banks are a necessity for life it&#8217;s self.  So I hear.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lending and borrowing is so much a part of nature that nature is currently ill and struggling because lending is not happening.  Business can&#8217;t get loans and thus expand resulting in job creation.  At least that is what I have been told.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Businesses can&#8217;t get loans and expand and hire.  Think about that statement and let&#8217;s change the screenplay.  &#8220;Dear, I&#8217;m worried we are missing an opportunity here.  You know our income is not changing and we are adding debt.  If you would just let me borrow some money I could hire someone to help me around the house and buy the tickets to that &#8216;How to make money in real estate&#8217; seminar.  We could apply that knowledge and within a few years be making more money.&#8221;     </div>
<div></div>
<div>Maybe you don&#8217;t think spending money on “How to make money in real estate” is the smart move, but is the proper natural answer to say: &#8220;Honey, you know we have to cut back on our spending and wait until we have saved enough to implement your plan.&#8221; ?  Is the proper natural answer to tell someone to wait until they have saved their money before they decide to get an education?  If your business is auto repair, is the proper answer to tell someone to wait until they have saved their money before they buy the tools needed for fixing cars?  Would RI have been able to implement their emissions testing which required the purchase of dynos by the garages if the answer was: Wait until you have saved the money to buy the dyno?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course not.  So this gets to one reason why the conservative concept, government borrowing is the wrong course of action, is it&#8217;s self so wrong never mind completely blasphemous according to their ideology. It is also why, when conservatives are in charge they do not cut and save.  They spend and borrow.  It is natural.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s take Honey&#8217;s and Dear&#8217;s screenplay a little further.  &#8220;But Dear, right now the rates are very low, lower than our mortgage.  Also, the equity we have in the house is about 86%.  I&#8217;ve consulted with the accountant, your friend the business consultant, listened to CNBC, Fox Business and interviewed others regarding &#8216;How to make money in real estate&#8217;.  They all agree, my plan is doable and appears sound.  If we just take about 15% of the equity, invest it in our knowledge and then apply the knowledge we will be doing better.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>We are now at the stickler of our dear conservative&#8217;s answer.  &#8220;&#8230; I see no possibility for improving our current position&#8230;&#8221;.   This is the part of the answer one has to believe in if you are to accept that the solution is only to cut and save.  This is the part of the answer that completely will not fit, will make you choke, will make you stumble when considering any other scenario related to the dear conservative&#8217;s understanding of nature.  Lending and borrowing is natural, righteous and good.   Do you want to make the banks extinct in nature?  If the answer is to &#8220;cut and save&#8221; then that is the implied desired results if we are to believe &#8220;I see no possibility for improving our current position&#8221;.   Go ahead, try to gel the two concepts.  Try to make your brain hold &#8220;I see no possibility, we must cut and save&#8221; and &#8220;lending and borrowing are natural, righteous and good&#8221; at the same time.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I ask you, be honest.  Which screenplay seems the more likely for Honey and Dear as they sit around the table.  Is it the one where they only cut spending or the one where a plan is laid out and they go to the bank so that they can accelerate the implementation and thus achieve the benefits sooner?    Which plan has the greater potential gain?  And, which one would be considered adding to the nations GDP?  Are the vast majority of the 99% really just sitting back and accepting their lot or are they actually trying to plan and implement the plan?  The simple fact that GDP is growing confirms the latter.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is the next thing wrong with the first screenplay but correct about the rewritten screenplay: equity.</div>
<div>At no time is the conservative (Republican or Democratic Party) using that word.  Have your heard anyone talk about the nations equity?  Its assets worth&#8230; net worth?  Even by those who know we need to spend (the freshwater Keynes minded economists) I have not seen it mentioned as part of why we could borrow without fear.  Borrowing is always justified with the rates are low, it would create jobs and grow the economy.  Of course with the subscript caution note of maybe inflation in the future.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>OK, everyone gets that part. Honey got that part.  But, Honey understood it further: equity.  Hell, the reason we had the real estate bubble is because the masses understood equity.  The righteous and good and natural banks pulled a Monsanto genetic manipulation and turned it into a retail product removing it from it&#8217;s natural environment and contaminated everything but, that&#8217;s another story.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Assets.  Tangible or otherwise.  Currently the entire discussion regarding our debt and deficit are all done based on income.  The numbers look huge.   $16.5 trillion in debt.   Deficits to add to the debt in the trillions and only $14 trillion per year to try to pay for it all. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>First, lets get Honey and Dear&#8217;s situation straight.   There is a very large chance as with you and I that  their annual income did not and was in fact much less than the value of the house they purchased.  Second, there are a vast majority of people who have, over 20 plus or minus years have paid off that house or are getting close to doing so with an annual income that is still multiples less than the value of the house.  Get it?  At the same time, that less than the value of the house annual income probably purchased some home improvements adding to the value of the assets?  The income probably purchased some education, adding to the value of the assets?  The income probably purchased some happy time, assuring the value of the knowledge assets?  That less than the value of the house annual income has created assets over time worth more than the annual income.  Multiples more.  But, and lastly there is one major difference between Honey and Dear and We the People nation.  The nation never will retire.  Think about it for a moment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I have been thinking about the problem with the use of the dinner table discussion as a vehicle for explaining the drive toward deficit reduction.  I know the government is the counter force to all that the private sector does in an economy.  I know about the World Banks report on intangible assets and our wealth creation.  I have noted the 1% income was rising faster than our GDP.  How long do you think that could/can go on, talk about dinner table discussion!   However, the public is in tune with the idea of dinner table discussions and the idea of cutting back to make ends meet at this moment in the “business cycle”.  So what was missing?</div>
<div></div>
<div>The public knows you can&#8217;t spend more than you have at ever greater rates.  I venture that the small business person knows you can&#8217;t take money out of the business faster than you can make it too.  So, to try to convince them that deficit spending is the correct approach becomes the metaphor of spitting into the wind.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>What was missing from the dinner table discussion was the word “equity”. Honey mentioned equity and the entire conversation took on an entirely different perspective.  So, US equity?  What is the value of our assets?  What is our equity?  Have we mortgaged so much of the equity that we can&#8217;t take advantage of nature and borrow?  Of course, if this were the pre-recession period for sure the answer would be no.  In fact, we would be able to borrow over 100% with no money down and no income check.   But, We the People have learned even if banking has not.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I went looking for equity numbers and found <a href="http://rutledgecapital.com/2009/05/24/total-assets-of-the-us-economy-188-trillion-134xgdp/" target="_blank">this article</a>: Total Assets of the U.S. Economy $188 Trillion  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>The best source of asset market, or balance sheet, information we have today is the document Z1: Flow of Funds of the United States produced after the end of each quarter by the army of economists working at the Federal Reserve Board.</div>
<div>One way to do it is to add up the numbers that we do know. I have done so in line 13. We know there are $141,512 billion in financial assets. We know that just three of those sectors own $46,301 billion in tangible assets. Adding those two numbers together produces a (reported) total asset number of $187,813 billion&#8230;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m not going to argue with or for this persons approach to the calculation.  There are some very good comments there regarding how to calculate the number.  <a href="http://rutledgecapital.com/2009/05/24/total-assets-of-the-us-economy-188-trillion-134xgdp/comment-page-1/#comment-654" target="_blank">One person</a> suggested this method:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>A reasonable tack to estimate the networth of the nation is to use our traditional financial technique of discounting the future predictable cash flows, using a ‘elected’ rate for discounting the cash flows&#8230;.So using this DCF discipline, we can posit that our net worth is about $234T.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>My first house in 1988 was purchased based on this method.  I had $60K in the bank but, based on my income, presto&#8230;I was now worth $250K.  I was smart and only bought the house I knew I could afford, not what my new found wealth suggested.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">Wikipedia </a>I learned that in 2008 the UN put our value at $118 trillion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is quit the range.  $118 to $234 trillion.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s rewrite the screenplay now. Honey convinced Dear that they should borrow the money so now they are talking to the bank. </div>
<div>Natural Bank: “Hello Dear and Honey, how may I help you?”   </div>
<div>Honey responds “Well, we need some money.  Currently our income is $14 trillion dollars and our debt is about $16.5 trillion and we are getting a little behind.  However, we have a plan to borrow some money and use it to improver our income flow.  Here is our business plan”.   </div>
<div>Natural Bank: “Well my quick read of your cover page looks promising, but I will need to let the department study it further.  In the meantime, what are your assets worth, do you have any equity?”</div>
<div>Honey responds: “Yes, based on the latest evaluations for property tax purposes our equity conservatively measured is $118 trillion but based on income flows as high as $234 trillion.  We like to use our own data tables from our accounting software and thus come up with $188 trillion”.</div>
<div>Natural Banker: “My, if this is true then certainly there is room to work with you.  How much were you considering to borrow?  We don&#8217;t get many potential clients such as yourself.  I think we can give you a special rate too!”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Kind of changes the ending of the dinner table discussion doesn&#8217;t it?  Honey and Dear have a debt that is between 7% of equity and 14% of equity.  Natural Bank is normally willing to go 75% of equity.    That gives us somewhere between $88.5 trillion and $175.5 trillion to invest in ourself.  That is money right now we could put to work that, as every Honey and Dear including Honey and Dear Small Business knows, if they invest it with an eye on improving their life, their income from the increased value of the assets will more than pay for the loan.  Also, the investment can only further improve the equity thus reducing the debt to equity ratio.  We&#8217;ll ignore inflation&#8217;s effect on debt.   This also ignores the fact that Dear and Honey are collecting rents from some of their assets that are well below historical market rates.  They were doing some of their friends a favor, unfortunately at their personal expense.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is one more thing. As noted the nation will never retire.  There is no time in the life of the nation, unlike Honey and Dear where it will not work to produce income.  Never.  That means there is no time in the life of the nation where it will need to rely on savings to pay it&#8217;s bills.   In fact, if the nation decided to do this, it would die.  Kind of like parts of Europe currently.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What do you think?  Are you going to be the Dear that tells Honey &#8220;forget it&#8221;,  just cut your spending until you can save the money?  I think if you do, Honey is going to tell you where to go.  In fact, I believe Honey has been telling Dear where to go for a while based on the polls.  “If only you would just listen to me for once!”</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Linda Beale</p>
<p>Red state tax &#8220;reform&#8221; and &#8220;economic growth&#8221;</p>
<p>As most tax practitioners and academics know, Professor Paul Caron maintains a &#8220;tax prof blog&#8221; that provides timely links to most things tax in major papers, blogs, journals, conferences and the like, as well as announcements and releases from the<a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">IRS</a>, Treasury and Congress related to tax.  Paul does not usually provide much analysis or opinion, but rather an excerpt or two and a title.</p>
<p>So a recent blog post was titled  &#8220;<a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2013/01/states-turn-.html">WSJ: States Embrace Tax Reform to Drive Economic Growth</a>&#8220;.</p>
<p>This is not an atypical way of titling items on tax prof blog.  The observant reader will notice a slight bias in the title.  The Wall Street Journal article is actually titled &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323968304578245720280333676.html?mod=djemEditorialPage_h">The State Tax Reformers: more governors look to repeal their income taxes</a>&#8221; (Jan 29 2013 updated).  The article summarizes states that are lowering or eliminating their income tax (sometimes including their corporate <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">income taxes</a>) and sometimes replacing it with a broad sales tax&#8211;for example, in the Republican strongholds of Nebraska and Louisiana.  The Journal article then goes on to opine (and it is indeed opinion) that &#8220;this swap makes sense&#8221; because &#8220;income taxes generally do more economic harm because they are a direct penalty on saving, investment and labor that create new wealth&#8221; whereas &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_tax">sales taxes</a> &#8230; hit consumption, which is the result of that wealth creation.&#8221;  This is the typical &#8220;free market&#8221; pitch favoring capital income (and the rich) over labor income (and everybody else). </p>
<p>Of course, the Journal then proceeds to quote <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Laffer">Art Laffer</a> for the right-wing corporatist ALEC in an article claiming that a majority of new jobs are created in states without an <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">income tax</a> because of their lack of an income tax.<br />[Aside:  Laffer is (in)famous as the &#8216;free market&#8217; economist who described his view of the maximum tax rate by drawing a bell curve on a napkin.  The Laffer Curve is more ideology than theory, as I explain in an earlier post:  <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2008/02/cfps-laffer-cur.html">CFP&#8217;s Laffer Curve Video</a>, ataxingmatter (Feb. 2008). ]</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Caron&#8217;s title suggests that the &#8220;real&#8221; policy reason for the shift is a &#8220;real&#8221; desire to create jobs. </p>
<p>I have significant doubts.  Most of the anti-income tax proponents are pro-Big Business and pro-wealth.  A shift from an income tax to a consumption/sales tax is a move from a somewhat (often minimally) progressive tax system to an explicitly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regressive_tax">regressive tax</a> system.  Such a move favors those with capital assets and mainly capital income.  Claims (like that made by the Civitas Institute cited in the Journal article) that shifting from income tax to sales tax will result in &#8220;average annual personal income growth&#8221; mean almost nothing since averaging income growth across a population doesn&#8217;t really tell you whether almost all of it goes to the wealthy or not&#8211;if that growth goes to those already in the wealthy distribution, then inequality increases and in fact most everybody else is worse off, in spite of the &#8220;average&#8221; growth.</p>
<p>The Journal acknowledges the regressive nature of a sales tax swap, but suggests that exemptions of necessities (e.g., food, medicine, utilities) and rebates for low-income families will suffice.  I also find that doubtful&#8211;the very low absolute benefit to the poor of the exemptions and/or rebates, while important, is substantially less than the very real high absolute benefit to the wealthy of the switch to a consumption rather than income tax.  Accordingly, the so-called &#8220;reform&#8221; will inevitably increase an already devastingly problematic inequality that has resulted in lower quality of life for most Americans on many different areas from literacy to access to <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2013/01/state-tax-reform-and-economic-growth.html#">health care</a> to teenage pregnancy to death rates and all the many other factors in which Americans enjoy a lower level of quality of life than most other OECD nations. </p>
<p>Not, in other words, a good idea.  As noted in Nick Carnes (who teaches at Duke University), <a href="http://www.newsobserver.com/2013/01/24/2630904/a-tax-reform-plan-that-rewards.html">A Tax-Reform Plan that Rewards the Wealthy and Stalls the State</a>, NewsObserver.com (Jan 24, 2013, modified Jan. 25, 2013), these proposals are being pushed by right-wing propaganda tanks, including a &#8220;<i>wealthy conservative foundation [that] has paid [Arthur] Laffer to write another report and to fly to our state to  promote it.</i>&#8221;  Id. </p>
<p>The goups behind these proposals have their one-size-fits-all state-level strategy down to a science, but they don’t have a handle on the actual science of state tax reform. It’s easy to see why their ideas are appealing. Who wouldn’t like to grow our economy and lower taxes without cutting vital services like schools and public safety?</p>
<p>However, independent economists in every state where the Laffer plan has been introduced – including North Carolina – have found serious problems with the evidence its proponents have used to back it up. No matter how low the tax rate is, businesses and wealthy people won’t relocate to a state where the schools are bad, the streets are unsafe and the infrastructure is crumbling – things that all tend to happen when taxes are cut to the levels that the Laffer plan outlines.  Id.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Carnes article goes on to note that &#8220;Kansas, which earlier passed the Laffer bill, is now projecting $800 million annual budget deficits and has extended an emergency sales tax that should have expired years ago&#8221; while state agencies are facing a 10% across the board cut, with education expected to lose a billion dollars in state funding over the next five years.  Yet no businesses have flocked to Kansas because of the legislation.  Id.</p></blockquote>
<p>And guess what.  It is the wealthy who would benefit if North Carolina were to carry through with enacting its own form of the &#8220;Laffer bill&#8221;.  Carnes notes that families earning $24,000 a year would pay $500 MORE in taxes under the Laffer plan, whereas wealthy families with incomes of more than $900,000 a year would pay $42,000 LESS in taxes.  Id. Shifting the tax burden from the wealthy who can easily bear it to the low-income who cannot, while at the same time cutting government support for essential public services that build a shared community is a disaster in the making.</p>
<p>The Wall Street Journal isn&#8217;t flummoxed by such facts (which it doesn&#8217;t even acknowledge).  The Journal article suggests that the idea (set forth in some Big Oil/Fracking states) of replacing income taxes with revenues from oil and gas extraction would be good (and maybe better than regressive sales taxes) because &#8220;it would make everyone a stakeholder&#8221; in increased drilling and fracking, thus &#8220;help[ing] to build a politicial constituency for more mining and drilling.&#8221;  Note the presupposition that supporting &#8220;more mining and more drilling&#8221; is inherently a public good! (One assumes that the Journal staff think this because Big Oil/Big Gas is Big Business, and the Journal is ALWAYS in favor of whatever Big Business wants.) </p>
<p>That idea strikes me as truly worrisome&#8211;we have a climate-change problem, and trying to &#8220;buy&#8221; votes to support environmental degradation at whatever cost through the swap of income taxes for some (probably minimal) increased royalties (probably also accompanied by less in the way of services, especially for the poor or for public goods like public education) is not a good idea.  Yes, probably those very people who are the poorest and most harmed by environmental degradation would tend to be able to be bought off by that swap&#8211;they would not realize that the wealthy are again getting the mountain of the share of the benefit, and they are bearing most of the burden in terms of the long-term costs of the environmental degradation as well as the long-term costs of lower public revenues spent on programs especially important to them because of their lack of a cushion of wealth (schools, public parks, fire/police, health care, etc.).</p>
<p>Interestingly, the Journal article notes that Alaska got rid of its income tax in the 1980s and suggests that&#8217;s been a good deal.  Of course, Alaska also gets more back from the Federal government than it gives in Federal taxes&#8211;ie, Alaskans have replaced their income tax revenues with federal handouts.</p>
<p>The Journal calls these plans for revamping state laws to provide substantial benefits to wealthy individuals and corporations a &#8220;rare bright spot in the current high-tax era.&#8221;  That is garbage from both sides.  We do not live in a &#8220;high-tax era.&#8221;  IN fact, we live in a low-tax era and we are already paying for that with the significant drop in state support for higher education, state support for parks and other public amenities (police and fire protection, protections for workers, fair and easy access to voting, etc.), and state support for K-12 education as well as the failure of the federal government to fund the kinds of infrastructure and education and basic research projects that could make the difference between a continuing great economy and the continuing muddle we are in after the Bush recession. </p>
<p>All of those costs are borne more substantially by those in the lower-income brackets.  With the proposed &#8220;reforms&#8221;, the wealthy will be sailing through with even more wealth, able to shut out even more effectively any association with the &#8220;lower class&#8221; elements and giving even less to support schools, colleges, unemployment benefits, etc.  Meanwhile, the poor and near-poor will get much, much less (when they didn&#8217;t owe much in taxes anyway).  Not a bright spot at all.  More like class warfare.</p>
<p>The real reason behind these shifts is to benefit the major members of the Republican base&#8211;i.e., Big Business and the wealthy.  It has little to do with jobs&#8230;  That&#8217;s just a handy obfuscating claim to make about policy moves that substantially shift the benefits of the economic system to the rich and the burdens of the economic system to everyone else.  This is just another element of the class warfare that has been waged for the last few decades to allocate gains to the wealthy.</p>

<p>In the Vice Presidential debate Ryan said that the Kennedy tax cuts generated so much growth that tax receipts increased enough to offset the revenue losses.</p>
<p>When I look at the data it sure looks like this claim is another one of his Any Rand fantasies.  The economy did grow rapidly after the Kennedy tax cuts,  but the deficit remained high. throughout  the  JFK-LBJ administration.  Moreover, like Reagan, LBJ finally had to raise taxes to recover the lost revenues.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Art at <a href="http://newarthurianeconomics.blogspot.com/">The New Arthurian Economics</a> and I are looking at the relationship between debt and economic  growth.  Art started with an observation of two FRED series, total  credit market debt owed (TCMDO) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP,   nominal or GDPC1, inflation adjusted &#8211; take your pick.)</p>
<p>Graph 1, from FRED, shows these data series.  I&#8217;ve chosen nominal GDP and, for reference, also included the total Federal Debt.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=bIb"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=bIb" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 1 TCMDO, GDP and Total Federal Debt</div>
<p>In  1950, TCMDO was about 1.3 times GDP, but growing a bit more quickly.   By 1980, the ratio was 1.6, and by 1987 it was greater than 2.  Now that  ratio is approaching 4.  Note that TCMDO is also close to 4 times  greater than total public debt.  This is why Art and I agree that  private, not public debt is the problem that needs to be addressed, but  is largely ignored.</p>
<p>Linked here are Art&#8217;s posts with graphs of YoY growth in both factors, <a href="http://newarthurianeconomics.blogspot.com/2012/10/three-decades-2.html">pre 1980</a> and <a href="http://newarthurianeconomics.blogspot.com/2012/10/three-decades.html">post-1980</a>.   Pre 1980, their moves are similar in magnitude, and pretty well  coordinated. Post 1980 there is still some occasional similarity of  motion, but the coordination breaks down and debt growth is generally  quite a bit higher than GDP growth.  The 80&#8217;s in particular stand out as  being starkly different from the previous period.</p>
<p>Graph 2 shows the entire data set, since 1952.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=bId"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=bId" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 2 YoY % Growth in TCMDO and GDP </div>
<p>These observations led Art to the reasonable hypothesis that, &#8220;Output growth slowed  when debt became excessive.&#8221;  This, in fact, might explain the great stagnation.</p>
<p>I suggested, and Art accepted two corollaries to his hypothesis.</p>
<p>1) There is a non-excessive amount of debt.  Let&#8217;s call it &#8220;just right.&#8221;<br />2) Below the &#8220;just right&#8221; amount, there might also be &#8220;not enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually,  there is a lower level hypothesis, to which Art&#8217;s is corollary:  That  there is a functional relationship between debt and growth, in which  growth is the dependent variable.</p>
<p>This is what I will explore in this post. </p>
<p>Graph  3 is a scatter plot of GDP vs TCMDO YoY % change for each, FRED  quarterly data from Q4, 1952 through Q2, 2012, with a best fit straight  line included.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ltbCeg6PZGc/UHY4w91szJI/AAAAAAAACAM/VbLR0ePCKS4/s1600/GDP+vs+TCMDO.jpg"><img border="0" height="272" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ltbCeg6PZGc/UHY4w91szJI/AAAAAAAACAM/VbLR0ePCKS4/s400/GDP+vs+TCMDO.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 3 GDP vs TCMDO, YoY % Change</div>
<p>The  relationship is quite clearly positive.  The R^2 value at .39 is rather  low, but not terrible.  There is quite a bit of scatter in the data.   Note the circle of data points around the left end of the line.  More on  that later.</p>
<p>Next, I divided the data by decades, frex,  1961-1970.  This admittedly simplistic data parsing reveals that the  slope and R^2 values are strongly variable over time.  Graph 4 shows the  scatter plot along with the slope and R^2 values for each decade.   These data values are arranged in the chart in chronological order and  color matched with the corresponding data points.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gZ9PGJtwBss/UHbTvxUjDZI/AAAAAAAACAg/mMeq9Tfd_RQ/s1600/GDP+vs+TCMDO+2.jpg"><img border="0" height="262" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gZ9PGJtwBss/UHbTvxUjDZI/AAAAAAAACAg/mMeq9Tfd_RQ/s400/GDP+vs+TCMDO+2.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 4 GDP vs TCMDO, YoY % Change by Decade</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve  added a brown line connecting the dots for the first decade of this  century.  The chronology proceeds from a cluster near the center of the  graph into a clockwise circular spiral.</p>
<p>Graph 5 shows how the slope and R^2 vary over time.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c90pTkiBAJs/UHbwlp5aIlI/AAAAAAAACA0/jfF0132hGl0/s1600/GDP+vs+TCMDO+Slope+Over+Time.jpg"><img border="0" height="250" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c90pTkiBAJs/UHbwlp5aIlI/AAAAAAAACA0/jfF0132hGl0/s400/GDP+vs+TCMDO+Slope+Over+Time.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 5 Slope and R^2 Over Time for GDP vs TCMDO</div>
<p>After  the 60&#8217;s, the slope plummets, and by the 80&#8217;s R^2 is a laughable  0.035.  Though the slope has remained low, R^2 has since recovered to  0.38, which is near the whole data set value of 0.39, and only slightly  less than the 0.40 to 0.44 of the first three decades.</p>
<p>The  slope changes can be interpreted as generally less GDP bang for the  TCMDO buck, as the TCMDO/GDP ratio increases.  This is totally  consistent with Art&#8217;s hypothesis.</p>
<p>I have more to say about the GDP -TCMDO relationship, but this post is getting long, so I&#8217;ll save it for a follow-up.</p>
<p>For now, I&#8217;ll close with a few questions.</p>
<p>1) Do you think we&#8217;re on to something?<br />2) What do you think of the methodology?<br />3) &#8220;Excessive debt&#8221; is suggestive, but non-specific.  How should this concept be quantized?<br />4) How should I go at exploring corollaries 1 and 2 mentioned after Graph 2?<br />5) Any thoughts on what was there about the 80&#8217;s that blew up the prior debt &#8211; GDP relationship?<br />6) Is there such a thing as productive vs non-productive debt, and how would they be characterized?</p>
<p>I look forward to your constructive comments.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In comments to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/09/the-effect-of-capital-gains-tax-on.html">my previous post</a>, Robert requested the unsmoothed data from Graph 3.  Here it is.   GPDI is plotted against the Capital Gains Tax Rate.</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4gw7zuZc7EA/UGMOA7Lno0I/AAAAAAAAB-M/0gBigw94kP4/s1600/Cap+Gain+and+GDPI+3-1.jpg"><img border="0" height="236" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4gw7zuZc7EA/UGMOA7Lno0I/AAAAAAAAB-M/0gBigw94kP4/s400/Cap+Gain+and+GDPI+3-1.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Since  the Capital Gains Tax Rate (X-axis) is quantized, the result is columns  of data.  Compared to the smoothed version, there is little change in  either the slope or intercept of the best fit straight line.  R^2 is, of  course, much lower.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Matt Yglesias, servitor to our corporate overlords, suggests that the  reduced capital gains tax rate paid by rentiers like Willard Romney is  really a very, very good thing.  <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/09/21/mitt_romney_s_effective_tax_rate_is_very_low_most_economists_think_it_should_be_.html">To wit</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The  main reason Romney&#8217;s effective rate is so low is that the American tax  code contains a lot of preferences for investment income over labor  income. <br />.   .   .   <br />But  this is definitely an issue where the conservative position is in line  with what most experts think is the right course, and Democrats are  outside the mainstream. <br />.  .  . <br />That&#8217;s  the theory, at any rate. It&#8217;s a pretty solid theory, it&#8217;s in most of  the textbooks I&#8217;ve seen, and it shapes public policy in basically every  country I&#8217;m familiar with. Even researchers like Thomas Piketty and  Emmanuel Saez (see &#8220;A Theory of Optimal Capital Taxation&#8221;) who dissent  from the standard no taxation of investment income position think  capital income should be taxed more lightly than labor income.  Empirically, it&#8217;s a bit difficult to verify that variations in capital  gains tax rates and the like really are making a material difference to  investment levels. But then again the data is noisy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Scott Lemieux at LGM <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2012/09/the-unpersuasive-case-for-not-taxing-capital-income">demurs</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sure,  if you 1)accept the premise that reducing or eliminating capital gains  taxes will result in productive infrastructure investments rather than  worthless accounting tricks, 2)ignore the economic benefits created by  consumption, 3)assume that significant numbers of people will forgo  money for doing nothing just because the profits will be taxed , and  4)ignore the fact that in most jurisdictions consumption is also “double  taxed,” then reducing capital gains taxes looks good.   But since all  of these assumptions are (to put it mildly) highly contestable, it’s  just question-begging.</p></blockquote>
<p>My  response to Matt is that in my jaundiced opinion, you might as well  consult The Necronomicon of Abdul Alhazred as an economics textbook for  an issue like this; and that in a world that has on the one hand  Krugman, Thoma and Delong, and on the other Fama, Cochran and Cowan, a  consensus among experts is about as likely as lions lying down with  lambs for some purpose other than a quick snack.</p>
<p>To Scott I say, why assume or ignore anything when that oh-so-noisy data is readily available?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Graph  1 shows the capital gains tax rate and year-over-year growth in gross  domestic private investment (GPDI,) each presented as a percent.  If  Matt and what he calls &#8220;the mainstream&#8221; are right, then there should be a  negative correlation between the tax rate and investment growth, since  higher taxes would be a disincentive to investment.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JB_yCh3JZ9Y/UGHWsgMqtNI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/7b4AHgcSjyA/s1600/Cap+Gain+and+GDPI.jpg"><img border="0" height="287" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JB_yCh3JZ9Y/UGHWsgMqtNI/AAAAAAAAB9Q/7b4AHgcSjyA/s400/Cap+Gain+and+GDPI.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 1  C G Tax Rate and GPDI, 1954 &#8211; 2011</div>
<p>Instead,  what we find is that over time, as the capital gains top rate has gone  down, so has GPDI.  This is indicated by the downward slope of the best  fit straight lines through each data set.  The best fit lines are based  on the data through 2008, so the huge 2009 negative in GPDI is not  represented.</p>
<p>One way to handle noisy data is to  superimpose a moving average.  The dark heavy line that snakes up to a  top in 1978 is an 8-Yr moving average.  This top corresponds exactly  with the last year of the 40% Cap Gains Tax rate.  The purple horizontal  line is the period average of GPDI YoY growth from 1954 through 2011.    Note that until 1986, the 8 Yr line is mostly above the long average  line, and since 1986 it is mostly below.</p>
<p>This is not  because the bottoms in the GPDI data set are lower since 1986.  A quick  look shows that, except for the 2009 plunge, they are not.  It is  because the peaks are lower.  The table gives a count of extreme data  points for GPDI growth, before and after 1982, the year the Cap Gains  rate was reduced to 20%.</p>

<p>Even  at a detail level, it appears that a higher tax rate corresponds with a  higher rate of investment growth, as both curves peak in 1978.</p>
<p>Graph 2 provides a close-up view of 1985 through 2005.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8KT7mIf1Klo/UGHi4wvWP0I/AAAAAAAAB9k/GHnzKhEs8PY/s1600/Cap+Gains+and+GDPI+2.jpg"><img border="0" height="287" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-8KT7mIf1Klo/UGHi4wvWP0I/AAAAAAAAB9k/GHnzKhEs8PY/s400/Cap+Gains+and+GDPI+2.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 2  C G Tax Rate and GPDI, 1985 &#8211; 2005</div>
<p>When  the Cap Gains tax rate was increased from 20 to 28% in 1987, the rate  of investment growth increased from 1.4 to 5.2%, and stayed at about  that level until it was derailed by the 1990-91 recession.  Then from  1992 through 2000, 8 of 9 years had GPDI growth above the long average  (purple line,) an unprecedented occurrence.  Granted, the last three of  these years were at the lower C G Tax rate of 21.19%, instituted in  1998.  But also note that this decrease did absolutely nothing to spur  increased investment.</p>
<p>Cutting across the data in a  different way, Graph 3 presents a scatter plot of the C G Tax Rate and  YoY GPDI growth, each presented as an 8 Yr average.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_MmgjO9HFoU/UGHp1nzNlSI/AAAAAAAAB94/OXqbBGbXzg0/s1600/Cap+Gains+and+GDPI++3.jpg"><img border="0" height="286" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_MmgjO9HFoU/UGHp1nzNlSI/AAAAAAAAB94/OXqbBGbXzg0/s400/Cap+Gains+and+GDPI++3.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 3 Scatter Plot of GPDI Growth vs C G Tax Rate, Smoothed</div>
<p>Even  with smoothing, there&#8217;s a lot of scatter.  No surprise, since many  other factors can affect investment: business cycle, commodity price  shocks, wars, etc.  I&#8217;m tempted to say the obvious relationship is that a  higher C G Tax rate leads to higher investment, but I don&#8217;t want to get  into a correlation-is-not-causation brouhaha.  So I&#8217;ll simply say that  the idea that lowering C G taxes leads to increased investment &#8211; and  therefore increased economic growth &#8211; is not only unsupported by the  data, it is refuted by the data, and therefore contrary to fact. </p>
<p>So, once again, we find a mainstream economic idea that is only valid in some imagined alternate reality.</p>
<p>Capital Gains Rate data can be found <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=161">here</a> (Returns With Positive Net Capital Gains Table, 1954-2008) and <a href="http://www.ctj.org/pdf/regcg.pdf">here</a>.   There are a few slight discrepancies between these sources, mostly in  transition years.  I have used the maximum tax rate, column farthest to  the right in either table.<br />Gross Domestic Private Investment is FRED series <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=b2e">GPDI</a>.</p>

<div>This follows the work of Mokyr (1993) and is the final construct of Bishai and Kung. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Basically, H_t is the current health stock of the population, E is a decreasing function of health stock as an environmental contagion, G is the quality of health production technology, B is the best available health technology in the area, and φ represents the gap between the best health technology and the actual health technology and is a decreasing function of capital. </div>
<div></div>
<div>What does this mean? Why should anyone care? </div>
<div></div>
<div>Simple&#8230;..</div>
<div></div>
<div>Any economy is dependent on the equation Y = f(K,L,H) with Y representing GDP, K equaling capital, L-labor, and H-health of the labor force.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What it means for the average reader? Well, investment in healthcare improvement by the government creates a positive feedback cycle where better health= better economic performance, which then becomes:</div>
<div></div>
<div>more health = more income= more health, etc. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Certainly there are also exogenous factors as demonstrated by the Preston Curve, and McKeown has documented these well, although not without criticism. But that is the subject of an entirely different post. </div>

<p>by <a href="http://www.economonitor.com/blog/author/rwilder3">Rebecca Wilder</a></p>
<p>Today <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/4-03082012-AP/EN/4-03082012-AP-EN.PDF">Eurostat released </a>its June estimate of real retail sales for the Euro area. On a month/month basis, real retail sales increased at a rate of 0.1%. However, on a trended basis, the 3-month/3-month average growth rate was down 0.7% in the three months ending in June. Given that the 3-month trended pace of contraction quickened compared to Q1, real consumption is likely to detract from Q2 GDP growth (spending components released on August 23).</p>
<p>On a Y/Y growth basis, there’s a 96% correlation between real retail sales and real private consumption by households and non-profit institutions. Using a simple linear regression, the annual growth rate of consumption should stabilize somewhat in Q2 compared to Q1.<br />\<br /><img alt="" height="362" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/EA_retail_sales_chart.jpg" width="489"></p>
<p>Across the region, real retail sales in Ireland, Estonia, and Germany are the only reported countries to see growth through Q2.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><em>Note: the chart below illustrates the 3-Month/3-Month growth rate through June 2012 (Q2/Q1).</em><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/retail_sales_country.jpg"><img alt="" height="375" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/08/retail_sales_country.jpg" width="492"></a></p>
<p>On balance, Q2 domestic consumption spending in the Euro area is expected to be buoyed by Germany through June. The problem is, German retail sales growth have just a 38% correlation with real consumption growth, so the bump in retail sales won’t necessarily feed through to consumption at the aggregate level.<br />Euro area real consumption is still contracting. The question then becomes: will the pace of consumption contraction increase or decrease in coming quarters? We’ll have to watch leading indicators such as retail and consumer confidence, <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/db_indicators/surveys/documents/2012/bcs_2012_07_en.pdf">both of which deteriorated in July</a>.<br /><strong><em><br /></em></strong><br /><strong><em>Rebecca Wilder</em></strong></p>

<p>Is Ireland the Poster Child of Growth?</p>
<p>I wanted to familiarize myself with the economic statistics in Ireland, so I thought that I’d share my findings with you all. Many politicians refer to Ireland as the poster child of austerity – according to the contentious thesis of expansionary austerity (a review from the IMF .pdf <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp11158.pdf">here</a>), is it therefore the poster child of growth? In this post, I review the cyclical data and find that the Irish economy is quite divergent with optimism only evident in the industrial and export sectors. In aggregate, there’s really been no momentum at all.<br />On the one hand, the industrial sector seems to be holding in okay, with the manufacturing PMIs remaining above 50 since March 2012. Furthermore, international saving, or the current account, moved from a 6% of GDP deficit in Q3 2008 to a small surplus in the fourth quarter of 2011 (4-qtr moving average). However, the current account has been deteriorating slightly at the margin, beginning in the second half of 2011.</p>
<p><em>Note: Except where noted in the legend, all charts below relate to the Irish economy.</em><br /><em><br /></em><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/pmi.jpg"><img alt="" height="325" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/pmi.jpg" width="422"></a><br /><img alt="" height="319" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/ca.jpg" width="423"></p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In contrast, the consumer sector is suffering quite explicitly. After yesterday’s revisions to previous months, we now see the harmonized unemployment hovering near its peak rate, 14.6% in May vs. 14.8% peak (in the chart below, the red line maps the pre-revised unemployment rates). Consumer confidence is very low, which implies that retail sales could tumble a bit in coming months. Furthermore, price inflation lost some steam, although it remains above the deflationary period that ended in 2010 by the headline measure. Core inflation dropped off in the last couple of months to just 0.4% Y/Y in May. Finally, for all of the optimism on Ireland, Q4 2011 GNP and GDP are just 1% and 0.7%, respectively, higher than their 2010 lows.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/unemployment_rate1.jpg"><img alt="" height="321" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/urate.jpg" width="424"></a><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/consumer_chart.jpg"><img alt="" height="324" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/consumer_chart.jpg" width="415"></a><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/inflation.jpg"><img alt="" height="324" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/inflation.jpg" width="415"></a><br /><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/agg_income.jpg"><img alt="" height="324" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2012/07/agg_income.jpg" width="415"></a></p>
<p>It’s probably too early to fully discount the orthodox expansionary austerity thesis – but at the minimum, it does appear as if any economic momentum has been gained primarily through global trade, and that sector is struggling. In all, I’d say that Ireland looks more economically depressed than ambitious and not the poster child of growth.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Mike Kimel</p>
<p>American Enterprise Institute Economists Redux</p>
<p>The other day I wrote a post about economists at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a prominent conservative think-tank.  The post began with <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/magazine/whats-the-easiest-way-to-cheat-on-your-taxes.html?_r=1&#038;ref=todayspaper&#038;pagewanted=all">this paragraph from a story in the NY Times</a>    <br />
<blockquote>Politicians sometimes say that lower tax rates lead to higher economic growth, which in turn leads to higher overall tax revenue. This may have been true in the early 1960s, when the top tax rate was 91 percent, but the top tax rate today is 35 percent. For decades, lower tax rates have led to lower government revenues, says Alan Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group. &#8220;The Reagan tax cuts, on the whole, reduced revenue,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;The Bush tax cuts clearly reduced revenue. There is no dispute among economists about that.&#8221; </p></blockquote>
<p>I noted that while Viard is right about tax cuts reducing federal revenue, he is wrong about &#8220;There is no dispute among economists about that.&#8221;  As evidence, I pointed to a piece by his sometime co-author, Kevin Hassett and another by Glenn Hubbard, the first Chair of the Council of Economic Advisors under GW Bush.  Both, I might add, are with the AEI (Hubbard as a visiting scholar).  It wouldn&#8217;t take long to point to other quotes by other AEI economists disputing what Viard said is not disputable (and which, not incidentally, shouldn&#8217;t be disputable given the data.)      At the AEI&#8217;s blog, James Pethokoukis <a href="http://blog.american.com/2012/04/angry-bear-bloggers-and-the-ugly-memory-hole/">responded</a> to my post.  There is no polite way to say this, so I&#8217;ll just state it as it is:  his post is riddled with errors.  Let me cover several of them.   Of my post, Pethokoukis says this:   <br />
<blockquote>I have read it several times but I am not exactly sure of its Big Point other than to say nasty things about economists who either work at AEI or are affiliated with AEI.  What I think author Ken Houghton is trying to say, maybe, is that supply-side economics doesn’t work. </p></blockquote>
<p>There are three errors here, all of them concentrated in the last sentence:   </p>
<p>1.  The author of the piece is not Ken Houghton.  It is Mike Kimel.  As it says, &#8220;Posted by Ken Houghton&#8221; but &#8220;by Mike Kimel.&#8221; </p>
<p>2.  The piece is not trying to say that supply-side economics doesn&#8217;t work.  Alan Viard of the AEI is quoted as saying something which translates as follows:  at least since Reagan took office, the tax cuts we have seen have led to lower revenues.  I don&#8217;t know if Viard is willing to go further and endorse the implication of his statement about taxes and revenues, which is this:   since the top marginal tax rate was at 70% before Reagan took office, and tax cuts from that 70% level and below have led to reduced revenues, if the Laffer curve is more than just a theoretical construct, unless we have a reason to believe that the last thirty two years of US history are an aberration, it turns out that we will not get an increase from revenue from a tax cut unless the top marginal tax rate is somewhere in excess of 70%.  Like I said, that&#8217;s an implication of Viard&#8217;s statement.  </p>
<p>That is not a point of the post, although in the post I did note that it seems Viard had seen data and was being honest about what the data stated.  But that is only a point of the post in the sense that stating &#8220;the New York Times quoted AEI Economist Alan Viard&#8221; is a point of the post, which is to say, it isn&#8217;t a point of the post at all. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />3.  The point of the post is that while one AEI economist is willing to state the obvious about tax cuts, and though he may state that no economist disputes the obvious, his more prominent colleagues at the AEI do dispute what the data so obviously shows.  I went further, and noted that Viard had to know that his own institute is a big part of the problem.     Pethokoukis&#8217; next sentence:</p>
<p> &#8220;Supply-side economics is simply a school of economic thought that believes a) incentives matter, b) high tax rates are bad for growth, and b) inflation is fundamentally a monetary phenomenon.&#8221;   </p>
<p>4.  I&#8217;ll ignore the grammatical error toward the end of the sentence &#8211; there are enough substantive issues in the post &#8211; and merely point out:  &#8220;incentives matter&#8221; is not something that defines supply-side economics any more than having two arms and two legs is a defining property of people of Swedish extraction.  </p>
<p>I have yet to meet an economist of any stripe who doesn&#8217;t believe incentives matter, just as I cannot think of any country whose citizens don&#8217;t typically come equipped with four limbs.  Its just that typically different schools of thought think incentives matter in different ways.  </p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take Marxism as an example.  I&#8217;m no Marxist, nor do I personally know any Marxists, but Marx can be summarized as: &#8220;those with capital have an incentive to exploit the workers to increase their profits, and the workers have an incentive to throw off their shackles, leading to a revolution.  As long as there as a division of people due to ownership, those incentives persist.  Peace, happiness, and prosperity can only exist by getting rid of those incentives, but only a revolution followed by a dictatorship of the proletariat can achieve that.&#8221;  Now, whether Pethokoukis or I agree with this story (for the record, I don&#8217;t, and I&#8217;m pretty sure Pethokoukis doesn&#8217;t either), there is no question that incentives are part of the story.  And I think I can show very clearly that supply siders treat certain incentives as egregiously as the Marxists do, but that&#8217;s for another post.</p>
<p> &#8220;Back in the 1970s, Keynesian economists really didn’t believe any of that stuff and they dominated the economics profession.&#8221;   </p>
<p>4a.  This is kind of a continuation of the previous error, and it indicates Pethokoukis doesn&#8217;t understand the basic point that Keynes was trying to get across.  I would assume that it isn&#8217;t controversy to say that Keynes General Theory, which is the basis for everything one can call &#8220;Keynesianism&#8221; can be summarized as follows:  &#8220;When the economy slows, people buy less stuff, so manufacturers hire fewer people, pushing up unemployment and decreasing wages.  This in turn slows the economy even more, leading to even more even pressure on employment and wages.  But if the government were to start buying stuff, counteracting the reduction in demand from the private sector, it will decrease the pain companies feel, and thus decrease the layoffs and the downward pressure on wages, preventing the economy from getting worse and ending the recession sooner.&#8221;  </p>
<p>If someone can tell that story in a way that doesn&#8217;t require both companies and workers to have incentives, I&#8217;d love to hear it.  Alternatively, if someone can define Keynesian philosophy of any stripe in a way that doesn&#8217;t involve some variation of the story I just told, I&#8217;d love to hear that.    FWIW, here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pkarchive.org/economy/GeneralTheoryKeynesIntro.html">Paul Krugman&#8217;s summary of the General Theory</a>:   <br />
<blockquote>Stripped down, the conclusions of The General Theory might be expressed as four bullet points: • Economies can and often do suffer from an overall lack of demand, which leads to involuntary unemployment  • The economy’s automatic tendency to correct shortfalls in demand, if it exists at all, operates slowly and painfully  • Government policies to increase demand, by contrast, can reduce unemployment quickly  • Sometimes increasing the money supply won’t be enough to persuade the private sector to spend more, and government spending must step into the breach</p></blockquote>
<p>Even if you prefer this formulation, its hard to say there aren&#8217;t incentives in the General Theory.     </p>
<p>5.  Most Keynesians do think higher tax rates slow economic growth.  In fact, back to Keyenes&#8230;. the flip side of having the government step in and spend money when the economy is slow is that, according to Keynes, when the economy is running full speed, the government should cut back on spending raise taxes.  One reason for raising taxes is to pay down the debt resulting from the deficit spending when the economy was in recession, but the other is to slow the economy to prevent it from overheating, thus prolonging the expansion.  For what its worth, I personally don&#8217;t think slowing the economy to prevent overheating fits what data we have, but Pethokoukis wasn&#8217; talking about me, he was talking about Keynesian economists in the 1970s.</p>
<p> &#8220;Today, pretty much everybody believes incentives matter, high taxes rates hurt growth and inflation is a monetary phenomenon. &#8221;   </p>
<p>6.  As I noted before, you could find that incentives matter in Marx and you could find it in Keynes&#8217; General Theory, the sources of two schools of thought to which most supply-siders will agree they are in opposition, both of which predate supply-side economics.  So the fact that pretty much everyone believes it today is a meaningless statement unless you can show that  Marx and Keynes were exceptions &#8211; they just happened to believe something that the supply-siders would later believe, but virtually nobody else other than Marx and Keynes held that supply-sider belief prior to the supply-siders.  Otherwise, we&#8217;re once again oohing and aahing over the fact that the overwhelming majority of Swedes have two arms and two legs.     </p>
<p>7. I&#8217;m not sure what Pethokoukis is saying when he says that everyone agrees that inflation is a monetary phenomenon, or that it is a big deal that everyone believes it now, except that he is slightly misquoting Milton Friedman.  That&#8217;s all very nice, but the belief that money affects inflation goes back a very long way.  Lenin, for instance, talked about debauching the currency.  Here&#8217;s Keynes, straight from the General Theory:   <br />
<blockquote>The view that any  increase in the quantity of money is inflationary (unless we mean by inflationary merely that prices are rising) is bound up with the underlying assumption of the classical theory that  we are always in a condition where a reduction in the real rewards of the factors of production will lead to a curtailment in their supply.</p></blockquote>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t sound like someone who doesn&#8217;t believe that the quantity of money is unrelated to inflation.  Its merely someone who believes that the quantity of money alone isn&#8217;t the only determinant of whether there is inflation &#8211; you aren&#8217;t going to have to fear inflation as much if there&#8217;s slack in the system.  To provide an obvious example of what Keynes was talking about almost eighty years ago:  I&#8217;m sure Pethokoukis knows how much the money supply has increased in this country since December 2007 and how little inflation we have had in that time.</p>
<p> &#8220;Supply-side economics is just economics, really. We’re all supply-siders now.&#8221;   </p>
<p>8.  Oh, really?  Well, as I noted above, Keynes agreed with the three beliefs that Pethokoukis ascribes to supply siders (incentives matter, higher tax rates slow growth, and inflation is a monetary phenomenon).  Yes, he had a different view of incentives than Pethokoukis, and he had some caveats on when money doesn&#8217;t affect inflation as much, but for the most part, by Pethokoukis&#8217; definition, Keynes was a supply sider, as are most of the folks he influenced.  (I note that I personally would not qualify as a supply sider by Pethokoukis&#8217; definition, which is to say, I don&#8217;t agree with Keynes on a key piece of that definition but that&#8217;s not the subject of this post.)</p>
<p> &#8220;Oh, and the Laffer Curve? Just common sense.&#8221;   </p>
<p>9.  True.  But common sense is often wrong.  See, the dirty little secret of modern economics as practiced in the US these days is that if you apply the Laffer curve to US data, and by that, I mean, no cherry picking.  Use the entire series of US government data going back to 1929, the first year for which official data exists, estimate revenues = f(top marginal tax rate, top marginal tax rate squared) you get a quadratic function as Laffer said.  The only problem is &#8211; <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">its upside down.</a>  Results are not different from what Laffer claimed, they are absolutely and precisely the opposite.     Don&#8217;t take my word for it.  Do it yourself.  Anyone who took an intermediate level undergraduate econometrics course and has access to a spreadsheet can do it.   &#8220;</p>
<p>Economic historian Bruce Bartlett calls the Laffer Curve “a generally accepted analytical device … [that is] a widely discussed subject in respected academic journals.” &#8221;   </p>
<p>10.  Show me a group of physicists discussing phlogiston and I&#8217;ll show you a group of physicists who should be extremely embarrassed.  As I said above, anyone who took an intermediate level undergraduate econometrics course and has access to a spreadsheet can fit a Laffer curve.   It takes a bit more effort than that to check into whether phlogiston theory has anything to it.</p>
<p> &#8220;In 1980, the top U.S. marginal income tax rate was 70 percent; today it is 35 percent. Yet the share of total income taxes paid by wealthier taxpayers has risen sharply. That is powerful evidence that the United States was on the wrong side of the Laffer Curve back in 1980. &#8221;   </p>
<p>11.  What do the first two sentences have to do with the last sentence?  The Laffer curve is not about the share of taxes paid by the wealthier taxpayers. As Pethokoukis himself wrote a few paragraphs earlier:   <br />
<blockquote>There are two tax rates that generate zero tax revenue, 0 percent and 100 percent. And in between, there is some tax rate which generates a maximum, non-zero amount of tax revenue. As tax rates rise from 0 percent toward that level, tax revenues increase both through higher economic growth and greater tax compliance. Once beyond that inflection point, higher tax rates generate less tax revenue.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, powerful evidence against the Laffer curve is, in fact, is provided by Pethokoukis&#8217; colleague Alan Viard of the AEI:   <br />
<blockquote>For decades, lower tax rates have led to lower government revenues, says Alan Viard, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative policy group. &#8220;The Reagan tax cuts, on the whole, reduced revenue,&#8221; he explains. &#8220;The Bush tax cuts clearly reduced revenue. There is no dispute among economists about that.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, for me this is just a hobby &#8211; I don&#8217;t get paid for this.  I&#8217;ve already spent too much time at this and I have to get to work.</p>
