<p><strong>The Tax Rate that Maximizes Economic Growth, Part 2&#8230; With Tax Burdens Too!</strong>Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=282">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>This post continues my look at the relationship between taxes and growth (what I modestly called the “Kimel curve”), which I will continue expanding on over a series of posts. Today I want to look at marginal rates, effective tax burdens, and how each or both affect growth rates. As an added bonus for non-economists and folks who don’t deal with statistics on a daily basis, I will also expand a bit on regression analysis and the process of building a rigorous “econometric model.” (Some basic material appeared at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=268">Presimetrics</a> and <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/top-marginal-income-tax-rate-should-be.html">Angry Bear</a> blogs).</p>
<p>To begin… its no secret that marginal tax rates don’t always have all that much to do with the amount that taxpayers actually pay. This is especially true for folks with extremely high incomes, particularly if a big chunk of their income doesn’t come with a W-2 attached. (Don’t take my word for it – I’ll give you a number later in the post.)</p>
<p>So, while the Kimel curve equation I provided last week dealt with the effect of the top individual federal marginal tax rate on economic growth, this week I want to throw the federal “tax burden” into the mix. The tax burden is simply the percentage of income that actually gets paid in taxes, which we can calculate as the personal current federal taxes divided by personal income. The former comes from line 2 of <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=87&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;Java">NIPA Table 3.2</a>. The latter came from line 1 of <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=58&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;Java">NIPA Table 2.1</a>.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />(If you&#8217;re new to my posts, the NIPA tables, or National Income and Product Accounts tables, are computed by the the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the Commerce Department, the agency responsible for computing GDP. They also keep track of a lot of other interesting data about the US economy.)</p>
<p>Real GDP comes from any number of tables on the BEA website – let’s just pull ‘em from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">here</a> this time around. And of course, we need top individual marginal tax rates <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175910,00.html">IRS&#8217; Statistics of Income Historical Table 23</a>.</p>
<p>Before we go on, let’s just note that the correlation between the tax burden and the top marginal rate from 1929 to 2008 is 4.5%, which is to say, pretty close to zero.</p>
<p>Now, I’m setting up a simple model of growth as follows:</p>
<p>Growth in Real GDP, t to t+1 = B0 + B1*Top Marginal Tax Rate, t</p>
<p>+ B2*Top Marginal Tax Rate Squared, t</p>
<p>+ B3*Tax Burden, t</p>
<p>+ B4*Tax Burden Squared, t</p>
<p>As I mentioned in the previous post, I’m throwing in the X and X squared terms to account for the fact that the effect of variable X on growth rates can change as X rises or falls. For example, maybe when tax rates are low, increasing taxes has only a small effect on growth, but as tax rates rise, further increases in those tax rates can have a very big effect on growth. I’m also fitting the model using a regression. If none of this makes sense, or you don’t remember how to interpret a regression, please take a look <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=268">here</a> again.</p>
<p>OK. So we let it rip, and get this ouput:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSHOt4btVLI/AAAAAAAAAf0/ZP05BE8M5gk/s1600/mike1.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSHOt4btVLI/AAAAAAAAAf0/ZP05BE8M5gk/s400/mike1.bmp"></a>Figure 1, Regression 1 Output</p>
<p>So now we can just go ahead and compute the optimal tax rate and optimal tax burden, right? Well, not so fast. Just because we ran a regression doesn’t mean its any good. Last week we discussed some of the diagnostics you can find in the output above, but what I didn’t mention is that you really should look at the error terms of the regression as well. The errors, or residuals, in a “good” regression look like they came out of a shotgun – they don’t have any obvious patterns. Patterns in the residuals from a regression mean something is systematically wrong with the way the model being estimated fits the data, and if something is systematically wrong, it can (and should be) fixed. Worse still, one of the mathematical assumptions of regression analysis is that you didn’t specify a model that has something systematically wrong with it, which means that the output of a regression is misleading in various ways if you there is something systematically wrong with the model. (In practice, you will never see a perfect shotgun pattern, but you want to shoot for something close.)</p>
<p>But, errors in this regression do show a pattern:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSHOuDBPUsI/AAAAAAAAAf8/lNU3MztfAUI/s1600/mike2.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSHOuDBPUsI/AAAAAAAAAf8/lNU3MztfAUI/s400/mike2.bmp"></a>Figure 2, Residuals Diagram 1</p>
<p>As the graph above shows, the errors tend to be pretty big in the beginning, and they tend to shrink over time. Since OLS regressions maximize the sum of squared errors, big errors early on mean the model is putting an overemphasis on the early years. Additionally, the correlation between the errors in one period and the errors in the next are about 50%; big errors tend to be followed by big errors, small errors by small errors, positive errors by positive errors, and negative errors by negative errors. Now, if you’re in a Ph.D. program where showing you have chops is a big deal, you’ll deal with this using any number of cool sounding techniques, each of which is built on a number of assumptions that are truly horrifying if you stop and think about it. But if you’re long gone from academia, and spent a decade post grad school working with these cool sounding techniques, you might have gotten smart and comfortable enough to have rediscovered the KISS rule. If that’s the case, you’ll take a look a second look at the residual graph, and conclude a few things:</p>
<p>1. The 1929 – 1932 recession was a major outlier early on</p>
<p>2. The early part of the US’ involvement in WW2 (starting in 1940- think lend lease, and other gov’t expenditure) is a major outlier</p>
<p>So you might, as a first pass, create a couple of dummies – one for the 1929 – 1932 recession, and another for “major US involvement in WW2” aka 1940 – 1944. A dummy variable takes a value of 1 or 0, which amounts to “yes the condition is met” or “no the condition is not met.”</p>
<p>Rerun the regression with those dummies and you get a regression with these residuals:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSHOuBkGeYI/AAAAAAAAAgE/pbZRORs6AIY/s1600/mike3.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSHOuBkGeYI/AAAAAAAAAgE/pbZRORs6AIY/s400/mike3.bmp"></a>Figure 3, Residuals Diagram 2</p>
<p>I’ve kept the scale in this graph the same as on the other. Notice… most of the big errors have dropped away, much of the “heavy early on” pattern is gone, and the correlation between errors in one period and errors the next has dropped quite a bit. A simple fix, and we’re good enough to move on for now. Here’s the output:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSHOuVABKLI/AAAAAAAAAgM/Bzw6z4S1Wnk/s1600/mike4.bmp"><img border="0" alt="" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSHOuVABKLI/AAAAAAAAAgM/Bzw6z4S1Wnk/s400/mike4.bmp"></a>Figure 4, Regression 2 Output</p>
<p>Notice… the new model (using tax data and a couple dummies alone) explains about 57% of the variation in the growth in real GDP. Also… the tax burden is not significant. (The P-values are too far above a “significant” value such as 0.01, 0.05, or 0.1 depending on how strict you want to be, or how many asterisks you want to put in your paper.) The two dummies, not surprisingly, are significant; growth was slower than the model would otherwise predict during the 1929-1932 recession/depression, and faster than the model would otherwise predict during the 1940-1944 period when the US gov’t ramped up its involvement in the War. (BTW… anyone thinking that war is a way to promote economic growth should consider we’ve had a number of other wars during this period. What was unique about 1940-1944 was the degree to which the government decided to run the economy.)</p>
<p>The top marginal tax rate and top marginal rate squared are both significant, and we can use them to compute a top marginal rate that maximizes growth (at least in this model). That figure is (drumroll): 62%. Pretty close to the 67% we computed using last week’s model. And nothing like what Congressman Ryan is likely to glean from reading Atlas Shrugs…</p>
<p>By the way, the list of things I want to look at in future posts, in no particular order, includes:</p>
<p>1. Is the post-WW2 (or post 1963, or post 1981, or post 1986) era different?</p>
<p>2. What is the effect of different demographic groups?</p>
<p>3. Does this work for other forms of growth?</p>
<p>4. Does this type of model always provide an “optimal” result? Does this apply to states? What about other countries?</p>
<p>5. What about other types of taxes, such as corporate taxes? Should we focus on the tax rates paid by middle income earners rather than (or in addition to) tax rates paid by folks at the top?</p>
<p>6. What about the national debt? Or government spending? Or other variables?</p>
<p>7. Does the political party of the President or the Congress matter?</p>
<p>8. What is the effect of the Fed on all of this?</p>
<p>9. How do we know whether this is all merely correlation or is there any sign of causality going on here?</p>
<p>10. Given that this isn’t rocket science, why aren’t “real economists” doing stuff like this? (I would be derelict in not mentioning this paper by <a href="http://econ.duke.edu/~peretto/CorporateTaxesGrowthAndWelfareFinal.pdf">Pietro Peretto at Duke</a>, which provides a model showing that “the endogenous increase in the tax on dividends necessary to balance the budget has a positive effect on growth.”)</p>
<p>This seems to have the potential to become the Mike Kimel full-employment act, though sadly, it isn’t my job and it doesn’t pay. Running regressions is quick and easy, and interpreting them (and spotting pitfalls) is second nature to someone who works with them on a daily basis, but pulling data, sorting it and organizing, and even just thinking about that data is very, very time consuming. So please have some patience as its going to take a while to get somewhere. Also… I will probably have occasional posts on other topics in the meanwhile as well.</p>
<p>All that said, one of my goals with these posts is to give non-economists a view of the way this sort thing is (or should be) done in the profession. If I’m not explaining enough, or not keeping it intuitive enough, let me know.</p>
<p>Finally, as always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants ‘em. This one has some cool info that I didn’t get a chance to use in this post, including corporate income, corporate taxes, and some demographic information. If you want to play along at home, or even move ahead of my posts, drop me a line and I’ll send you what I have. Até à próxima, pessoal.</p>

                                <p>&#8230;Corporations. Since earnings season is now well underway, I decided to look at the breakdown of aggregate domestic income (gross domestic income). Corporate profits are up 44.7% since the <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/main.html">outset of the US recovery</a>, while wages and salary accruals are up just 0.9%.</p>
<p><img border="0" alt="" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TLcmy_NMcoI/AAAAAAAADSk/Y3ri0cXBUYQ/s400/GDI_components.PNG">The chart above illustrates the peak-trough losses (total loss), trough-Q2 2010 gains (total gain), and peak-Q2 (relative to peak) deviations of <a href="http://bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=51&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">nominal gross domestic income</a>, disaggregated by income type.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>First up, wages and salaries (employer contributions for employee pension and insurance funds and of employer contributions for government social insurance) and private enterprises net of corporate profit incomes grew in sum spanning the recession (private enterprises net of corporate profits includes proprietor&#8217;s income, which did fall). Furthermore, the drop in wage and salary accruals, -3.6%, was small compared to the drop in corporate profits, -18.1%.</p>
<p>Second, the corporate profit gains during the recovery massively outweigh the wage and salary gains over the same period, 44.7% versus 0.9%. Corporate profits are now 18.5% above the peak in 2007 IV, while wages and salaries hover 2.8% below.</p>
<p>The problem here is, that the deleveraging cycle is heavily weighted on the household sector (the workers at the corporations) &#8211; if corporate profit gains do not translate into hiring and wage gains, or even to further capital spending, economic growth will suffer going forward.</p>
<p>Better put, at the very minimum, the recent surge in corporate profits is not sustainable if firms do not distribute the gains to the real economy. Also, meager wage gains does make <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/reducing-household-financial-leverage.html">healthy deleveraging </a>difficult for household sector. Therefore, the recent surge in gross domestic income (hence, it&#8217;s spending counterpart, GDP) is not sustainable if corporate profits are not recycled.</p>

                                <p>What&#8217;s your answer? &#8220;Thinking about the past few decades… to the best of your knowledge, which ONE of the following U.S. Presidents do you think did the best job of managing the economy?&#8221;
<ul>
<li>Bill Clinton</li>
<li>Ronald Reagan</li>
<li>Barack Obama</li>
<li>Lyndon B. Johnson</li>
<li>George W. Bush</li>
<li>Richard Nixon</li>

<p>I wonder why near half of those polled think that Clinton did the best job of “managing the economy”. Using one simple metric, private-sector financial leverage (accumulated dissaving), Clinton ranks among the top three worst economic managers, behind George Bush (Jr.) and Ronald Reagan.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TIzcEfwsS6I/AAAAAAAADOw/F6gH6RFZvRc/s1600/leverage_chart.png"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TIzcEfwsS6I/AAAAAAAADOw/F6gH6RFZvRc/s400/leverage_chart.png" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart illustrates private-sector leverage as a stock of debt to GDP indexed to the start of each Presidential term. Therefore, the numbers are not the debt ratios, rather the appreciation of the debt ratios since the onset of each President&#8217;s term. The data are from the Fed&#8217;s <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/Z1/Current/">Flow of Funds Accounts</a>.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The sector financial balances model of aggregate demand posits that fiscal policy must shift in order to normalize GDP amid deviations of the private-sector surplus (desire to save) and the current account (see <a href="http://wallstreetpit.com/8568-the-sector-financial-balances-model-of-aggregate-demand">Scott Fullwiler’s article</a> on the sector financial balances model of aggregate demand, which references similar work by Bill Mitchell and Rob Parenteau; or you can see last week’s answers and discussion to <a href="http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=11424">Bill Mitchell’s quiz</a> for a simple outline).</p>
<p>When the private sector is levering up, the public sector is not doing its job. Since the 1990’s, the private sector loaded up on debt (ran private-sector deficits) in order to maintain GDP closer to full employment in the face of shrinking government deficits relative to those of the current account (since 1991 the current account trended down as a % of GDP). Deregulation, of course, contributed as well.</p>
<p>According to this metric, Barack Obama ranks highest to date, thanks to the automatic stabilizers and the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2010/07/14/cea-releases-fourth-quarterly-report-economic-impact-recovery-act">ARRA</a>. But we’ll see what happens when 2011 rolls around: the waning stimulus will drag economic growth; the Congressional tides may turn; and the immediacy of the crisis continues to fade. Unless firms start to “dissave” and pass on profits to households via hiring and wage growth, we may be in for a rocky ride, since the household desire to save will hover at very high levels for years to come (see <a href="http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/2010/09/what-mess.html">David Beckworth’s post</a> on the growing mismatch between mortgage debt load and real estate valuations).</p>

<p><strong>Tax Burdens and Economic Growth – Answering the Objections</strong></p>
<p>This piece is cross-posted with <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=92">the Presimetrics Blog</a>.</p>
<p>Consistent with findings in Presimetrics, the book I wrote with Michael Kanell which will be released in August, I’ve had some posts whose results contradict standard economic theory.  In some cases, readers have insisted that the results must be some sort of anomaly.    Perhaps the biggest offender is a graph which appeared in <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=50">this post</a>.  The graph shows growth rates in real GDP per capita by Presidency, where each President is color coded by whether he increased the tax burden (in this case defined as federal government revenues as a share of GDP) or decreased it:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1axWNOnI/AAAAAAAAATQ/xhSkh-vMz9w/s1600/growth1.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1axWNOnI/AAAAAAAAATQ/xhSkh-vMz9w/s320/growth1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a> Figure 1</p>
<p>The graph shows that Presidents who cut the tax burden produced slower growth, on average, than Presidents who increased the tax burden.  For many people, this doesn’t make sense at all.  (An explanation for why these results show up is provided <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=86">here</a>.  Now, I’ve already some of the objections that have been raised to this, mostly in private or in comments at the Angry Bear blog.   In fact, the graph above by itself answers one of the objections – I was told many times that FDR only produced faster growth because the economy accelerated during World War 2.  Thus, the graph only shows FDR’s results through 1938, which avoids the war, the build-up to the war, and even Lend Lease.   </p>
<p>Another criticism is that somehow the fact that I’m assuming that Presidents have an effect on the economy is the problem, and that a better way to do this is to look at the business cycle.  But I’ve had posts looking at the business cycle, and increasing tax burdens doesn’t look all that much better as an economic strategy across the business cycle either.  For instance, consider the following graph, one of several fairly damning graphs I posted <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=3">here</a> and  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/%EF%BB%BF%EF%BB%BFhttp://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/05/effect-of-tax-cuts-and-tax-hikes-on.html">here</a>:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1bZaEnnI/AAAAAAAAATY/kpF73XGTgEw/s1600/growth2.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1bZaEnnI/AAAAAAAAATY/kpF73XGTgEw/s320/growth2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a> Figure 2<br /><a name="more"></a><br />If cutting the tax burdens is the right prescription during a recession, it isn’t evident from the above graph.  </p>
<p>I’ve also been accused of cherry-picking, though I’ve gone as far back as the data allows, and on most posts on this subject, I’ve actually chucked the WW2 years.  In addition, I’ve noted that throwing out outliers doesn’t change results materially.  But what if the last eight decades have all been an anomaly?  After all, shouldn’t we consider the “Roaring ‘20s,” a period which every textbook tells you was a period of rapid growth.  After all, such intellectuals as Glenn Beck, Thomas Woods, and Amity Shlaes are quick to assure that the prosperity of the 1920s was due to tax cuts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the NIPA tables don’t go that far back, so we don’t have actual data on real GDP per capita (or the tax burden).  But I’ve done my best to examine that claim; the following graph, which first appeared <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/04/1920s-depression-glenn-beck-thomas.html">here</a>, shows the top marginal tax rates and the periods (shown in gray) when the economy was in recession.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1b1038EI/AAAAAAAAATg/eAv_UNhbx9A/s1600/growth3.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ1b1038EI/AAAAAAAAATg/eAv_UNhbx9A/s320/growth3.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3</p>
<p>While the 1920s was, indeed, a period when marginal tax rates were reduced, it was a period of recession followed by recession followed by recession followed by the Great Depression.   The longest consecutive months spent outside of recession during the 1920s was 27 months!  Two years and a quarter.   In fact, the economy was in recession (if not outright Depression) a full 44% of the time during the 1920s.  If these were roaring years, those roars were extremely short-lived.   </p>
<p>Which moves us to the next issue – I’ve been criticized for focusing on the tax burden rather than the marginal tax rate, the exception being in periods where the tax burden is not available.   Frankly, of all the criticisms, that one seems especially weak.  For those with enough income, the marginal tax rate is as much a fiction as the MSRP on a car; Warren Buffett’s offer of $1 million dollars to anyone on the Forbes 400 list who could prove they pay a higher share of their income in taxes than their secretary remains untaken.  </p>
<p>Moving on to the next criticism…   I’ve been told my interpretation of the above graph is wrong – it is not so much that higher tax burdens are correlated with faster economic growth, but rather that administrations that produced rapid economic growth tended to feel they could raise tax burdens, and that administrations suffering from poor growth kept tax burdens low to try to remedy a bad situation.</p>
<p>I dealt with that issue in recent posts by grouping the periods from 1929 to the present into eight year administrations, where possible.  Those administrations were made up of the eight year terms of Presidents who served two terms (or in FDR’s case, the first two terms only).  Added to those were eight year periods in which a Vice Presidents took over for a President who died or otherwise left office.  For each of those eight year terms, I created <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=60">the following graph </a>.  It shows the change in the tax burden in the first two years of each administration along one axis, and economic growth on the other axis:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2MxHT8UI/AAAAAAAAATo/k03X9X7UJJ8/s1600/growth4.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2MxHT8UI/AAAAAAAAATo/k03X9X7UJJ8/s320/growth4.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 4</p>
<p>Clearly, economic growth in years 3 through 8 cannot explain changes in the tax burden in earlier years unless one assumes time travel, clairvoyance, or one heck of a coincidence.</p>
<p>And speaking of coincidence, we arrive at another common complaint:  there simply are not enough observations to reach a conclusion of any sort.  Left unstated, of course, is that though the tax cutting Presidents had the lousiest economies, and that (as per graph 4) tax cutting led the economic growth, somehow a supposed lack observations validates the idea that lower taxes does produce faster economic growth.</p>
<p>Now, those who complain about the lack of observations generally insist that a) I don’t know the first thing about statistics and b) you need 30 or more observations to reach a conclusion.     Now that critique dates back at least three years, having been made by an anonymous blogger for the Economist who I understand is now known as Megan McArdle, and my answer (to point b.) back then is as good of an answer as any:</p>
<blockquote><p>Which is what degrees of freedom are for… Maybe there&#8217;s something wrong with the textbooks on my shelf, but the t distribution tables in the back of those textbooks have as few as 1 (one) degree of freedom. When the degrees of freedom are low, the t-statistics has to be really high in order in to reject H0. Or something like that – what do I know? </p></blockquote>
<p>Allow me to explain.  If there are a large enough number of observations to work with, it is possible to find a statistically significant difference between two things (events, peoples, outcomes, whatever) that at first glance or from a distance look very similar to the unaided eye.  However, if there are a very small number of observations, then differences have to be larger and more obvious for them to be statistically significant.   Consider three medications to extend the lives of patients with a specific type of cancer, where two have obtained FDA certification and the third was cooked up by the creepy guy who lives two houses down and uses cat puke as an active ingredient.  It might take hundreds of observations to tell which of the first two medications is more effective, but it shouldn’t take very many to tell how well the third one compares.  </p>
<p>And while in the past I sometimes decided to answer this question by running a t-test or some non-parametric test, it always seems to lead to questions about the assumptions by people who clearly never ran a hypothesis test in their lives but have one or another political point to defend to the death.  So let me try something else – an argument by analogy.  Consider the graph below.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NM-TzLI/AAAAAAAAATw/W7PBSs8LLcM/s1600/growth5.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NM-TzLI/AAAAAAAAATw/W7PBSs8LLcM/s320/growth5.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 5</p>
<p>If such a graph came from a study comparing outcomes of medications, where patients were assigned a medication but otherwise told to go about their daily business, there’d be no argument that, at least as a first approximation, there’s no reason whatsoever to assume that Medication 2 was more efficacious than Medication 1.  And if the disease in question was a particularly rare one, and the graph above represented the testing performed on every known sufferer since 1929, most of us would be appalled if a doctor decided to treat the next sufferer with Medication 2.  At the very least, we would assume that the burden of proof going forward should lie not with the proponents of Medication 1 but rather with the supporters of Medication 2, whether we understood the mechanisms by which either of these pharmaceuticals worked (or purported to work) or not.</p>
<p>And yet, this graph is identical to Figure 1, except that I changed the title and some labeling.  </p>
<p>But there is another problem with the small sample objection.  See, there are many ways to test whether there has been a negative correlation between tax burdens and economic growth, and looking at the national economy is only one of those ways.  I’ve also had a number of posts at the Angry Bear blog looking at how states have fared over the years, and there are 50 of those.  In fact, that was the topic of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2006/08/state-tax-burdens-and-growth-rates.html">the first post I ever wrote</a> four years ago next month.  In that post, a comparison of the states, using data from 1990 to 2005 yielded the following conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>Thus, the data doesn’t seem to support the idea that lower taxes are associated with faster growth rates. In fact, the opposite is true, especially for the fastest growing states. One way to interpret this is to conclude that taxes are actually below their optimal rates, and therefore, at the margin, the government is actually more efficient than individuals at converting its spending into growth. Society needs a certain amount of public goods (infrastructure, public health, confronting the Canadian menace, etc.) for businesses to thrive, and perhaps we currently have too little provision of public goods rather than too much. </p></blockquote>
<p>And the other posts I’ve had using similar state level data have all led to the same findings.</p>
<p>Another problem frequently brought up is that growth is too complicated to be explained by a single variable.  We agree, and in the book, we actually provide a model that uses several variables.  But be that as it may, it isn’t reasonable to state that while cutting tax burdens produces faster economic growth, that effect gets swamped by opposing forces when you look at the data systematically, whether you’re looking at the performance of Presidents, at the growth during business cycles, or the performance of states.  Clearly, if reducing the amount that people pay in taxes is so beneficial to the economy, somewhere that effect would show up.  It shouldn’t be overwhelmed by other variables pushing in the opposite direction every time one tried to test it systematically and consistently.</p>
<p>Moving on, we have another little gem – that the performance of the two regimes (tax cutters and tax hikers) is not independent.  The argument is this:  tax hikers do well because they follow tax cutters who laid the foundation for growth.  Tax cutters do poorly because they have the misfortune of following tax hikers who set up the economy for a fall.  </p>
<p>This one is particularly easy to hit out of the park.  First, note that there is only one tax hiker that is followed by another tax hiker:  LBJ followed JFK.  And LBJ produced the second fastest growth in our sample, which is to say that simply following a tax hiker is no guarantee of poor performance. </p>
<p>Now, look what happens when you consider only Presidents that followed their tax burden cutting peers:</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NiTfaBI/AAAAAAAAAT4/v3rI9doNIdE/s1600/growth6.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TDJ2NiTfaBI/AAAAAAAAAT4/v3rI9doNIdE/s320/growth6.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 6</p>
<p>Notice that following a tax cutting President doesn’t mean one will turn in a poor performance… unless one is also a tax cutting President.  In fact, tax cutting Presidents that followed other tax cutting Presidents did worse than tax cutting Presidents who followed tax hikers.  Imagine that.  It’s almost as if the longer tax burdens are cut, the worse the outcome.  </p>
<p>And yes, I included Hoover in the above graph though we don’t have the data to know with certainty that his predecessor, Calvin Coolidge cut the burden since Coolidge is renown as a small government guy.  But leave out Hoover, and leave out Obama’s first year, and you still aren’t left with anything other than:  In fact, tax cutting Presidents that followed other tax cutting Presidents did worse than tax cutting Presidents who followed tax hikers.</p>
<p>Which leads to the sorriest objection I’ve heard, namely that the American public, the constantly gulled American public, has the ability to reason out the outcome of economic policies on the macroeconomy to near-perfection, at least in 4 year increments.  And the way it manifests itself here is this:  when the economy is about to sour, we elect tax cutters, who, in turn, manage to limit the scale of the impending disaster.  </p>
<p>This, ahem, theory (gurgle, choke) is the efficient market hypothesis on LSD.  But it has the advantage of being able to explain pretty much anything.  The problem is that it does so by breaking everything down to utter nonsense.  For instance, it would indicate that the recent housing bubble and economic meltdown, rather than being a surprise, was actually anticipated on some unconscious level by the American public, and selected for as being much better than the alternative.  Ditto the Great Depression.  So what was this worse thing that was avoided?  Locusts?  Famine and pestilence?  Billions of furious yetis descending on us from their Himalayan stronghold?  </p>
<p>And yet, despite the fact that this story makes a virtue out of nonsense, it still isn’t internally consistent.  For instance, if the American public understood that only a series of tax cuts were going to save us from something worse than the Great Recession, then wouldn’t GW have managed to have won the popular vote in 2000 and achieved a landslide in 2004.  Conversely, does the fact GW received fewer votes than Al Gore indicate that perhaps the American public did not perceive that really big threat a few years in the future?  It’s easy to knock down a story that is built on nonsense.</p>
<p>All of which brings us back to the point of this post.  Michael Kanell and I have noted that lower tax burdens are not correlated with more rapid economic growth.  In fact, from 1929 to the present (and in the book, we focus on the period from 1952 to the present) administrations that have cut the tax burden have performed worse than administrations that raised the tax burden.</p>
<p>And I think we, together and separately, have answered every reasonable objection that has come up, and even quite a few unreasonable objections to boot.  And we’ve done so in a consistent and open manner.  In our book and in my posts, we’ve been open and clear about our methods and data sources, and we’ve made an effort to treat the data as consistently and systematically as we were able.  At some point, the burden of proof should no longer lie with us, but rather on those who cling to a story that simply is not consistent with the data we have observed in the U.S. over the past few decades.  Frankly, I think we’re well past that point.</p>

<p><strong>Presidents, the Tax Burden, and Economic Growth</strong></p>
<p>This post also appears at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=50">Presimetrics Blog</a>.  It contains some information that has appeared in a few different Angry Bear posts, but I think I’m starting to manage to put it into a more coherent narrative.  And as I’m able to do that, I’m able to move slowly to the next part of the story. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago I had a post <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=34">on the Presimetrics blog</a>, also on the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/06/economic-growth-rates-presidents-party.html">Angry Bear blog</a> looking at economic growth rates and political parties.  The post shows that from 1929 (that’s as far back as GDP goes) to 2009, growth in real GDP per capita was faster when the president was a Democrat than when the President was a Republican.  Furthermore, growth was faster for Democratic Presidents who faced a Democrat-majority Congress during their entire term than for those who did not face a Democrat-majority Congress for at least part of their administration.  Similarly, Republican Presidents facing Democratic majority in Congress during their time in office tended to better than Republican Presidents facing Republican majorities for most or all of their term.  It isn’t a message you’ll hear very often, but it is the only one that is compatible with the data, as you can easily check yourself.</p>
<p>In this post, I want to look at one of the major distinctions between Democrats and Republicans, and that is tax policy.  Let’s start by looking at the Federal tax burden (total Federal government current receipts / GDP) by President.  The data comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables.  Federal government current receipts were pulled from  <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=87&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;Java">line 1 of NIPA Table 3.2</a>, and GDP comes from <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/Federal%20government%20current%20receipts%20come%20from%20the">NIPA Table 1.1.5, line 1</a>.  (Note – this is slightly different than the way we do it in <ital>Presimetrics</ital> but it is nice to change things up now and make sure that results don’t change.) <br /><a name="more"></a><br />The graph below ranks the Presidents by the annualized change in the tax burden.  The change is measured from the year before a President took office (the “baseline” level) to his last year in office.  </p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TBVxknqoWuI/AAAAAAAAALU/hZlTNB_ME4Y/s1600/change1.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TBVxknqoWuI/AAAAAAAAALU/hZlTNB_ME4Y/s320/change1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 1.</p>
<p>(As is my practice in these posts I tend not to include the years <strike>through</strike> after 1938 for FDR because otherwise someone is going to claim that whatever happened while FDR was in office was due entirely to World War 2.)</p>
<p>The graph shows that there is some correlation between the parties and changes in the tax burden.  Every single Republican president for whom there is data reduced the tax burden.  Conversely, every Democrat except Truman has raised the tax burden.  Obama, at least during his first year, is on track to follow Truman and lower the tax burden. </p>
<p>The next graph shows growth rates in real GDP per capita (obtained from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2009&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;Jav">line 10 of NIPA Table 7.1</a>)</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TBVxkVNS9qI/AAAAAAAAALM/UDehyBKeUNs/s1600/change2.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TBVxkVNS9qI/AAAAAAAAALM/UDehyBKeUNs/s320/change2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 2.</p>
<p>The graph shows very clearly that Presidents who hiked the tax burden produced faster economic growth – by far – than the Presidents who cut the tax burden. </p>
<p>And should there be any tea-partiers reading this, yes, in his first year, Obama cut the tax burden.  A lot.  The so-called stimulus package involved a lot of tax cuts.  But as I’ve already noted, to get out of a recession, <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=15">government  spending</a> has historically been much more useful as a stimulus than <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=3">tax cuts</a>. </p>
<p>Here’s another way to look at things:</p>

<p>The graph below repeats Figure 3., but it includes a few labels if you want to know which point represents which President.</p>

<p>In any case, it’s pretty clear that if lower taxes provide any benefits to economic growth, those benefits are extremely well disguised.  In fact, it appears that lower taxes are a prescription for slower, not faster economic growth.  (Try reconciling the data with Republican, libertarian, or Austrian economic theory.)</p>
<p>Now… I do not believe that higher taxes, in and of themselves, are a cause of faster economic growth.  In the book we suggest a few reasons why higher tax burdens might correlate with faster economic growth.  But since the book went to press, I’ve had a bit of time to think about ways to test some of these ideas, and I’ve come up with a few new thoughts as well.  I hope to try out a few of these ideas in blogs in future posts.</p>

<p>I have emphasized short-run job creation quite a bit recently, and I have noted, implicitly at least, that we shouldn&#8217;t be too picky about the quality of the jobs that are created. Most jobs will do.</p>
<p>But in the long-run the quality of jobs matters a lot, and when the private sector finally begins reabsorbing the unemployed, the underemployed, and the discouraged, we want people to be able to find jobs with decent wages and benefits &#8212; jobs that are as good or better than the jobs they had before. </p>
<p>But where, exactly, will those jobs come from? I wish I had the answer.</p>
<p>Education is part of it, better education means better jobs on average, and it&#8217;s easy to imagine a substantial fraction of the population benefiting from an educational advantage. So I won&#8217;t back off prior calls to improve education at all levels.</p>
<p>But even if we substantially improve education, it won&#8217;t fully solve the problem. There will still be a need for quality jobs that are not all that dependent upon knowledge based skills. However, it&#8217;s harder to imagine an emerging set of industries that will provide the large number of quality jobs that we need to replace those lost from industries in decline.</p>
<p>If these jobs fail to be created in the next years and decades, the result will be an ever widening gap in the distribution of income with, as now, a group at the top doing relatively well, and everyone else treading water at best. </p>
<p>Is it overly pessimistic to worry that we may be headed in that direction?</p>

(Short version: &#8220;As with my mother, I wasn&#8217;t, and look what I&#8217;m doing now. Uh, well&#8230;&#8221;)</p>
<p>But, <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/1731/divorce-and-upward-mobility">via Andrew Samwick</a>, <a href="http://economicmobility.org/assets/pdfs/Family_Structure.pdf">a study from the Pew Foundation</a> (PDF) using PSID data finds that:<br />
<blockquote>Among children who start in the bottom third of the income distribution,<br />only 26 percent with divorced parents move up to the middle or top third<br />as adults, compared to 42 percent of children born to unmarried mothers<br />and 50 percent of children with continuously married parents.</p></blockquote>
<p>Or, in ratio terms, it is only 19% more likely that the child&#8217;s eventual economic status will be improved if the mother marries someone and stays married until the child is eighteen, compared to a 61.5% improvement in the expected well-being of the child if the mother remains unmarried for the entire eighteen years.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, twice as many children have parents who divorce before the child is nineteen (14%) than are raised by unwed mothers (7%).</p>
<p>There may also be elements of selection bias in the data: a woman who opts to raise a child on her own instead of getting married is more likely to instill that independence of spirit in her child than someone who enters into what turns out to be a bad marriage.</p>
<p>The other interesting table in the study shows how severely income inequality increased across a generation.
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S_QoXm2XCTI/AAAAAAAAAa0/vl401TBrvqE/s1600/mobilitytable1.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/S_QoXm2XCTI/AAAAAAAAAa0/vl401TBrvqE/s400/mobilitytable1.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Note that the bottom tier improves the least, that the 50th percentile grows much slower than even the 75th, and that the percentage change in the Mean is greater than the percentage change at any tier except the 90th percentile.</p>
<p>So much for the rising tide having lifted all boats—clearly, it capsized a few.</p>

                                <p>Sometimes, I hate being right.  Most of those times are when I take a pessimistic view of data; this has happened a lot recently.</p>
<p>It gets worse when the people who agree with you are none other than The Giant Vampire Squid.  As <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2010/05/15/number-of-the-week-0-growth-without-temporary-factors/">the Wall Street Journal notes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Zero — First quarter GDP growth, minus the temporary factors of government stimulus and inventories, as estimated by Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p>With the economic recovery already nine months old, it’s easy to forget just how tenuous it remains. Consumers are spending and businesses are investing, but an uncertain amount of that activity depends on temporary lifts, most notably the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p>I promise to get enthusiastic about inventory growth when people stop claiming that the drop in sales is based on the Demand side of the equation; that the banks aren&#8217;t holding more than $1 Billion in Excess Reserves because they want to, but rather because they can&#8217;t find borrowers.</p>
<p>Looking at state budget projections for next year, the reality that inventories cannot grow indefinitely, the unemployment and discouraged-workers levels, and the growth in long-term unemployment, it&#8217;s difficult to find engines for growth.</p>
<p>Real GDP recovery is described fairly as, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/05/real-gdp-in-recoveries.html">at best, lethargic</a>.  And now we know that even the lethargic recovery is stimulus-induced, not real.</p>
<p>But the headline numbers have given an excuse to do nothing, and steroid withdrawal is, I am told, a very painful experience.</p>

                                <p>I remain very skeptical about the sustainability of the recovery, as the labor market is in shambles and nominal wage growth is unlikely to facilitate “healthy” deleveraging &#8211; please see this recent post “<a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/04/reducing-household-financial-leverage.html">Reducing household financial leverage: the easy way and the hard way</a>”. I digress; because you can&#8217;t fight the data. And for now, the consumer is back.</p>
<p>The latest retail sales figures reveal two bits of information worth noting. First, autos were a big factor in the March 2010 surge. Second, even though the large contribution from motor vehicles and parts compromises my enthusiasm somewhat, the underlying trend has emerged: consumers are less frugal in spite of income constraints.</p>
<p>The March <a href="http://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf">advanced retail sales</a> report was genuinely strong, 7.6% annual pace since March of last year or 1.6% over the month and seasonally adjusted. At first I thought that this heroic sales growth was just a scam. March auto sales were unusually large in response to the competitive pricing during the peak of the Toyota scandal. See <a href="http://www.edmunds.com/help/about/press/162306/article.html">Edmunds.com’s </a><a href="http://www.edmunds.com/help/about/press/162306/article.html">preview</a> of the March <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/ALTSALES?cid=98">light weight vehicle sales</a> that registered a large 11.75mn gain.</p>
<p>And in reality, the March number was driven largely by auto sales, contributing 1.1% to the 1.6% monthly growth in retail sales. Furthermore, 36% of the total sales bill drove 5.7% of the 7.6% annual gain: nonstore retailers, motor vehicles and parts, and gasoline stations.</p>

Just look at the evolution since January 2010 (after revisions, of course).<a name="more"></a></p>

The number next to the date for each chart (title) is the annual total retail sales growth, and you can find the data at the census website<a href="http://www.census.gov/cgi-bin/briefroom/BriefRm"> here</a>.</p>
<p>You might ask yourself now, what do retail sales look like when conditioning for the robust growth in nonstore retailers, motor vehicles and parts, and gasoline stations? What’s happening to the other 64% of sales? Here’s where the green shoots become even more evident.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S8eXFZqoKJI/AAAAAAAADAs/SIZ8BP3nZeM/s1600/levels_chart.PNG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S8eXFZqoKJI/AAAAAAAADAs/SIZ8BP3nZeM/s400/levels_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The trajectory of retail sales ex nonstore retailers, motor vehicles and parts, and gasoline stations is more of the 60-degree type, an auspicious sign for the near-term recovery.</p>
<p>However, as I have stated time and time again, further deleveraging is imminent. Whether that happens through default or through income growth is all the same in the aggregate &#8211; that is, until default causes further macroeconomic instability. Until the economy generates income enough to pay down leverage, the risk of a double dip remains as the inventory cycle is laid to rest. Economic momentum is gaining; let’s just hope that policymakers don’t screw it up.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s something of interest: our friend <a href="http://marketwatch666.blogspot.com/2010/04/go-figure.html">rjs is looking at a</a> sales tax conundrum&#8230;.</p>

                                <p>This is a guest contribution by Marshall Auerback, Braintruster at the <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/?author=48">New Deal 2.0</a></p>
<p>by Marshall Auerback</p>
<p>A new book by Kenneth Rogoff and Carmen Reinhart, &#8220;This Time It&#8217;s Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Follies&#8221;, has occasioned much comment in the press and blogosphere (see <a href="http://bilbo.economicoutlook.net/blog/?p=8322#more-8322">here</a> and <a href="http://www.newdeal20.org/?p=8682">here</a>)</p>
<p>The book purports to show that once the gross debt to GDP ratio crosses the threshold of 90%, economic growth slows dramatically.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s too simplistic:  a ratio is just a number. Debt to GDP is a ratio and the ratio value is a function of both the numerator and denominator. The ratio can rise as a function of either an increase in debt or a decrease in GDP. So to blindly take a number, say, 90% debt to GDP as Rogoff and Reinhart have done in their recent work, is unduly simplistic.  It appears that they looked at the ratio, assumed that its rise was due to an increase in debt, and then looked at GDP growth from that period forward assuming that weakness was caused by debt instead of that the rise in the ratio was caused by economic weakness.  In other words, they have the causation backwards:  Deficits go up as growth slows due to the automatic countercyclical stabilizers.They don&#8217;t cause the slow down, etc.</p>
<p>After the Second World War, the debt ratio came down rather rapidly—mostly not due to budget surpluses and debt retirement but rather due to rapid growth that raised the denominator of the debt ratio. By contrast, slower economic growth post 1973, accompanied by budget deficits, led to slow growth of the debt ratio until the Clinton boom (that saw growth return nearly to golden age rates) and budget surpluses lowered the ratio.</p>
<p>From 1991 through 2001 the growth of government debt had been falling and since then rising most recently at a faster pace. The raw data comes courtesy of the <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/">St. Louis Fed</a> (and <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/ccc?key=0At5H3VSggybJdEk4MDBWU0lTWF9FNjRwM1JfWEJIR0E&#038;hl=en">attached spreadsheet</a>).</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S5VdcTTsTII/AAAAAAAAC6s/mhe-3HAwAuE/s1600-h/debt_chart.PNG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S5VdcTTsTII/AAAAAAAAC6s/mhe-3HAwAuE/s400/debt_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The Ratio of the rates of change of Debt / GDP is rising faster than the change in Debt indicating that both the increase in Debt and the fall in GDP are contributing to a rising Debt / GDP ratio.  For policy makers who obsess about a rising Debt / GDP ratio, they fail to understand that austerity measures that cut GDP growth will cause a rise in the Debt to GDP ratio. Basically, it boils down to this simple observation: it is foolish, dangerous, and thoroughly counterproductive to treat fiscal balances in isolation. In particular, setting a fiscal deficit to GDP target equal to expected long run real GDP growth in order to hold public debt/GDP ratios at a completely arbitrary (indeed, literally pulled out of thin air) public debt to GDP ratio without for a moment considering what the means for the feasible range of current account and domestic private sector financial balance is utterly nonsensensical.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>It is crucial that investors and policy makers recognize and learn to think coherently about the connectedness of the financial balances before they demand what is being currently called fiscal sustainability. As it turns out, pursuing fiscal sustainability as it is currently defined will in all likelihood just lead many nations to further private sector debt destabilization. To put it bluntly, if the private sector continues to pursue a high net saving/financial surplus position while fiscal retrenchment is attempted, unless some other bloc of nations becomes large net importers (and the BRICs are surely not there yet), nominal GDP will fall in the fiscally &#8220;sound&#8221; nations, the designated fiscal deficit targets WILL NEVER BE ACHIEVED (there can also be a paradox of public thrift), and private debt distress will simply escalate.</p>
<p>In fact, if austerity measures are based on measures of debt relative to economic growth there is a very real risk of a downward spiral where economic growth declines at a faster pace than government debt and the rising Debt / GDP ratio leads to ever greater austerity measures. At a minimum, focusing only on the debt side of the equation risks increasing the Debt / GDP ratio that is the object of purported concern is likely to lead to policy incoherence and HIGHER levels of debt as GDP plunges.  The solution is to recognize that the increase in the ratio is in some fair measure the result of declining economic growth and that only by increasing economic growth will the ratio be brought down. This may cause an initial rise in the ratio because of debt financing of fiscal stimulus but if positive economic growth is achieved the problem should be temporary. The alternative is to risk a debt deflationary spiral that will be much more difficult (and costly) to reverse.</p>
