<p>Explaining Why Low Tax Rates are Correlated with Slower Economic Growth, Once Again  </p>
<p>One of the regular mysteries facing economists is why the US economy fails to display evidence of a relationship that everyone seems to accept implicitly, namely that lower taxes lead to (or even are correlated with) faster economic growth.  Sure, the argument is sometimes made by academics using rather heroic assumptions.  The paper everyone seems to cite these days uses the assumptions made by politicians before a change in the tax rate as the &#8220;effect&#8221; that actually occurred after the change in the tax rate.   Non-academics rely on other heroic assumptions.  My favorite is attributing the rapid growth during the three years of the Kennedy administration to a cut in tax rates that occurred the year after he died.  (Actually, even Alan Greenspan made this one well before he made the transition from Maestro to goat.)     </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken a crack at explaining that puzzle, most recently <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/simple-explanation-for-strange-paradox.html">here</a>:   <br />
<blockquote>people will want to minimize their tax burden at any given time subject provided it doesn&#8217;t decrease their lifetime consumption of stuff plus holdings of wealth. Put another way &#8211; all else being equal, peoples&#8217; incentive to avoid/evade taxes is higher when tax rates are higher, and that incentive decreases when tax rates go down. Additionally, most people&#8217;s behavior, frankly, is not affected by &#8220;normal&#8221; changes to tax rates; raise or lower the tax rates of someone getting a W-2 and they can&#8217;t exactly change the amount of work they do as a result. However, there are some people, most of whom have high actual or potential incomes and/or a relatively large amount of wealth, for whom things are different. For these people, some not insignificant amount of their income in any year comes from &#8220;investments&#8221; or from the sort of activities for which paychecks can be dialed up or down relatively easily. (I assume none of this is controversial.) <br /><a name="more"></a>Now, consider the plight of a person who makes a not insignificant amount of their income in any year comes from &#8220;investments&#8221; or from the sort of activities for which paychecks can be dialed up or down relatively easily, and who wants to reduce their tax burden this year in a way that won&#8217;t reduce their total more or less smoothed lifetime consumption of stuff and holdings of wealth. How do they do that? Well, a good accountant can come up with a myriad of ways, but in the end, there’s really one method that reigns supreme, and that is reinvesting the proceeds of one’s income-generating activities back into those income-generating activities. (i.e., reinvest in the business.) But ceteris paribus, reinvesting in the business… generates more income in the future, which is to say, it leads to faster economic growth.  To restate, higher tax rates increase in the incentives to reduce one’s taxable income by investing more in future growth.</p></blockquote>
<p>Restating again:  when the tax rate is 75%, a business owner has a strong incentive to reinvest all his/her profits in the business rather than take those profits out and consume them.  This is because reinvesting in the business means the profits aren&#8217;t pulled out and thus aren&#8217;t recognized as income by the IRS.  Reinvesting in the business also increases the business&#8217; chances to do well in future years, which generates growth for the economy.  On the other hand, when the tax rate is 15%, there is more of an incentive to take out profits and engage in consumption of the type that does not generate much growth.     </p>
<p><a href="http://uneasymoney.com/2012/04/03/why-low-marginal-tax-rates-might-have-harmful-side-effects/">David Glasner</a> has another (albeit complementary) suggestion:   <br />
<blockquote>The connection it seems to me is that doing the kind of research necessary to come up with information that traders can put to profitable use requires very high cognitive and analytical skills, skills associated with success in mathematics, engineering, applied and pure scientific research. In addition, I am also positing that, at equal levels of remuneration, most students would choose a career in one of the latter fields over a career in finance. Indeed, I would suggest that most students about to embark on a career would choose a career in the sciences, technology, or engineering over a career in finance even if it meant a sacrifice in income.  </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If for someone with the mental abilities necessary to pursue a successful career in science or technology, requires what are called compensating differences in remuneration, then the higher the marginal tax rate, the greater the compensating difference in pre-tax income necessary to induce prospective job candidates to choose a career in finance. So reductions in marginal tax rates in the 1980s enabled the financial sector to bid away talented young people from other occupations and sectors who would otherwise have pursued careers in science and technology. The infusion of brain power helped the financial sector improve the profitability of its trading operations, profits that came at the expense of less sophisticated financial firms and unprofessional traders, encouraging a further proliferation of products to trade and of strategies for trading them.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Tim Duy <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/2012/02/its-worse-than-you-think.html">body-slams St. Louis FRB President James Bullard</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Estimates of potential GDP are not simple extrapolations of actual GDP from the peak of the last business cycles. They are estimates of the maximum sustainable output given fully employed resources.  The backbone of the <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/30xx/doc3020/PotentialOutput.pdf">CBO&#8217;s estimates is a Solow Growth model</a>.  So I don&#8217;t think that <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2012/02/jim-bullard-chucks-solow-growth-model.html">Noah Smith is quite accurate when he says</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>So, basically, what we have here is Bullard saying that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neoclassical_growth_model">neoclassical (Solow) growth model</a> &#8211; and all models like it &#8211; are wrong. He&#8217;s saying that a change in asset prices can cause a permanent change in the equilibrium capital/labor ratio. </p></blockquote>
<p>Bullard can&#8217;t be saying the Solow growth model is wrong because he doesn&#8217;t realize that such a model is the basis for the estimates he is criticizing. [first and last link in the original; Noah Smith link copied from elsewhere in the original post]</p></blockquote>
<p>Go <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/2012/02/its-worse-than-you-think.html">Read the Whole Thing</a>.  For those of you too lazy to do that without incentive, here&#8217;s the conclusion:<br />
<blockquote>Bottom Line:  Bullard really went down an intellectual dead end last week.  He criticized the focus on potential output, but revealed that he doesn&#8217;t really understand the concept of potential output either empirically or theoretically.  He then compounds that error by arguing against the current stance of monetary policy, but fails to provide an alternative policy path.  And the presumed policy path, tighter policy, looks likely to only worsen the distortions he argues the Fed is creating.  I just don&#8217;t see where Bullard thinks he is taking us.</p></blockquote>

<p>A Modest Forecast:  The Average Real Growth in Ireland will Exceed 10% a Year From 2012 to 2014</p>
<p> You read the title correctly:  the Irish economy will grow by more than 10% next year.  Now, hearing that, you might be asking yourself:  &#8220;Is this guy for real?  He must be nuts.&#8221;</p>
<p> Because I&#8217;ve looked around and nobody is predicting that sort of growth for Ireland for the next few years.   So let me lay out ten facts that should make it obvious to just about everyone:</p>
<p>1.  According to the <a href="http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/saveselections.asp">Central Statistics Office</a> of Ireland, real GDP (measured in 2009 Euros) peaked at 45,583 million Euros in the fourth quarter of 2007.  It bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2010 at 39,403 million Euros.  That is, real GDP fell by 13.5%.  Since then, GDP has barely budged.  So its safe to call 2011, four years after the peak, as a year when the bottom out process was ongoing.</p>
<p>2.  According to the OECD, <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/46/18/2506453.xls">Ireland&#8217;s all in top marginal tax rates are about 52.1%</a>.</p>
<p>3.  According to the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">BEA</a>, real GDP (measured in 2005 dollars) was 976.1 billion in 1929. It reached a nadir of 715.8 billion in 1933, amounting to a drop of 26.6%.  Note that while growth was negative in 1933 (four years after the peak), it was just a small drop.  The bulk of the decrease occurred from 1929 to 1932.   </p>
<p>4.  According to the <a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>, the top Federal marginal tax rate was 63% in 1934, and it rose to 79% in 1936.  Note that this wasn&#8217;t an &#8220;all in&#8221; rate.</p>
<p>5.  According to the BEA, <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls">real economic growth in the US</a> in 1934, 1935 and 1936 was 10.9%, 8.9% and 13.1%.  The annualized rate of growth from 1933 to 1938, years which I&#8217;m cherry-picking to show some relatively poor growth, was 6.7% a year.   <br /><a name="more"></a>6.  FDR instituted a number of large scale programs.  For instance, <a href="http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/wpa/wpa_info.html">[b]y March, 1936, the WPA rolls had reached a total of more than 3,400,000 persons</a>.  For comparison,  according to the BEA&#8217;s <a href="http://www.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=9&#038;step=1">NIPA Table 7.1</a>, the entire population of the US in 1936 was 128.181 million.  Thus, 2.7% of the US population was employed in the WPA alone.  Throw in the CCC, the Rural Electrification Administration, the TVA, and I think we can all agree that the Federal government was playing a big role in the economy.</p>
<p>7.  Many eminent worthies, too many to name, in fact tell us that the rapid growth in the economy from 1933 to 1940 was due to the bounce-back in the economy.  They also tell us that the economy would have recovered much more quickly if FDR had not followed socialist policies.</p>
<p>8.  Ireland doesn&#8217;t have as far to bounce back from as the US did in 1934, implying slower growth in Ireland today than in the US in 1934.</p>
<p> 9.  On the other hand, taxes are much lower in Ireland today than in the US in 1934, and nobody is accusing the Irish today of following socialist policies, implying faster economic growth in Ireland today than in the US in 1934.</p>
<p>10.  Facts 8 and 9 probably cancel each other out, leaving us to expect, on average, about the same growth rate in Ireland over the next few years as we saw in the US during the New Deal years when FDR ruined the economy.</p>
<p>As the eggheads say, QED.  </p>
<p>What&#8217;s nice about this is that we will see rapid growth in other countries too.  Taxes are much lower in the US now then they were during the New Deal years, and for all the cries of socialism and whatnot, there is WPA or CCC or Rural Electrification Program.  Heck, even the Fed doesn&#8217;t seem to want to do anything about jobs and that&#8217;s part of its mandate.   Back to the eggheads for a moment.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a bunch of them who think the New Deal helped the economy, that lower taxes don&#8217;t generate faster economic growth or that its a good idea for the government go out and buy stuff to boost demand at times of economic weakness.  Boy are those folks about to be surprised by the magic of the free market and low taxes.    &#8212;  <a href="http://art-bin.com/art/omodest.html">Disclosure</a>: <br />

<p>In this post, I will show that during the New Deal era, changes in the real economic growth rate can be explained almost entirely by the earlier changes in federal government&#8217;s non-defense spending. There are going to be a lot of words at first &#8211; but if you&#8217;re the impatient type, feel free to jump ahead to the graphs. There are three of them.</p>
<p>The story I&#8217;m going to tell is a very Keynesian story. In broad strokes, when the Great Depression began in 1929, aggregate demand dropped a lot. People stopped buying things leading companies to reduce production and stop hiring, which in turn reduced how much people could buy and so on and so forth in a vicious cycle. Keynes&#8217; approach, and one that FDR bought into, was that somebody had to step in and start buying stuff, and if nobody else would do it, the government would. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />So an increase in this federal government spending would lead to an increase in economic growth. Even a relatively small boost in government spending, in theory, could have a big consequences through the multiplier effect &#8211; the government hires some construction companies to build a road, those companies in turn purchase material from third parties and hire people, and in the end, if the government spent X, that could lead to an effect on the economy exceeding X. </p>
<p>This increased spending by the Federal government typically came in the form of roads and dams, the CCC and the WPA and the Tennessee Valley Authority, in the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA) tables it falls under the category of nondefense federal spending.</p>
<p>Now, in a time and place like the US in the early 1930s, it could take a while for such nondefense spending by the federal government to work its way through the economy. Commerce moved more slowly back in the day. It was more difficult to spend money at the time than it is now, particularly if you were employed on building a road or a dam out in the boondocks. You might be able to spend some of your earnings at a company store, but presumably the bulk of what you made wouldn&#8217;t get spent until you get somewhere close to civilization again. </p>
<p>So let&#8217;s make a simple assumption &#8211; let&#8217;s say that according to this Keynesian theory we&#8217;re looking at, growth in any given year a function of nondefense spending in that year and the year before. Let&#8217;s keep it very simple and say the effect of nondefense spending in the current year is exactly twice the effect of nondefense spending in the previous year. Thus, restated, </p>
<p>(1) change in economic growth, t = <br />f[(2/3)*change in nondefense spending t, <br />(1/3)*change in nondefense spending t-1]</p>
<p>For the change in economic growth, we can simply use Growth Rate of Real GDP at time t less Growth Rate of Real GDP at time t-1. The growth rate of real GDP is provided by the BEA in an easy to use spreadsheet <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdpchg.xls">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, it would seem to make sense that nondefense spending could simply be adjusted for inflation as well. But it isn&#8217;t that simple. Our little Keynesian story assumes a multiplier, but we&#8217;re not going to estimate that multiplier or this is going to get too complicated very quickly, particularly given the large swing from deflation to inflation that occurred in the period. What we can say is that from the point of view of companies that have gotten a federal contract, or the point of view of people hired to work on that contract who saved what they didn&#8217;t spend in their workboots, or storekeepers serving those people, they would have spent more of their discretionary income if they felt richer and would have spent less if they felt poorer. </p>
<p>And an extra 100 million in nondefense spending (i.e., contracts coming down the pike) will seem like more money if its a larger percentage of the most recently observed GDP than if its a smaller percentage of the most recently observed GDP. Put another way, context for nondefense spending in a period of rapid swings in deflation and inflation can be provided by comparing it to last year&#8217;s GDP. </p>
<p>So let&#8217;s rewrite equation (1) as follows:</p>
<p>(2) Growth in Real GDP t &#8211; Growth in Real GDP t-1<br />f[(2/3)*change in {nondefense spending t / GDP t-1}, <br />(1/3)*change in {nondefense spending t-1 / GDP t-2}]</p>
<p>Put another way&#8230; this simple story assumes that changes in the Growth Rate in Real GDP (i.e., the degree to which the growth rate accelerated or decelerated) can be explained by the rate at which nondefense spending as a perceived share of the economy accelerated or decelerated. Thus, when the government increased nondefense spending (as a percent of how big the people viewed the economy) quickly, that translated a rapid increase in real GDP growth rates. Conversely, when the government slowed down or shrunk nondefense spending, real GDP growth rates slowed down or even went negative. </p>
<p>Note that GDP and nondefense spending figures are &#8220;midyear&#8221; figures. Note also that at the time, the fiscal year ran from July to June&#8230; so the amount of nondefense spending that showed up in any given calendar year would have been almost completely determined through the budget process a year earlier. </p>
<p>As an example&#8230; nondefense spending figures for 1935 were made up of nondefense spending through the first half of the year, which in turn were determined by the budget which had been drawn up in the first half of 1934. In other words, equation (2) explains changes in real GDP growth rates based on spending determined one and two years earlier. If there is any causality, it isn&#8217;t that growth rates in real GDP are moving the budget.</p>
<p>Since there stories are cheap, the question of relevance is this: how well does equation (2) fit the data? Well, I&#8217;ll start with a couple graphs. And then I&#8217;ll ramp things up a notch (below the fold). </p>
<p>Figure 1 below shows the right hand side of equation (2) on the left axis, and the left hand side of equation (2) on the right axis. (Sorry for reversing axes, but since the right hand side of the equation (2) leads it made sense to put it on the primary axis.) 
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4dY1m2EY2Us/TsrFpr4A5JI/AAAAAAAAArQ/6ZIYetwIssE/s1600/Figure%2B1%2B-%2BNondefense%2Bspending.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4dY1m2EY2Us/TsrFpr4A5JI/AAAAAAAAArQ/6ZIYetwIssE/s320/Figure%2B1%2B-%2BNondefense%2Bspending.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Notice that the changes in nondefense spending growth and the changes in the rate of real GDP growth correlate very strongly, despite the fact that the former is essentially determined a year and two years in advance of the latter. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the same information with a scatterplot:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xvTB3Plc4VU/TsrFydUPepI/AAAAAAAAArc/Ng8V9ATBnUI/s1600/Figure%2B2%2B-%2BNondefense%2Bspending.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xvTB3Plc4VU/TsrFydUPepI/AAAAAAAAArc/Ng8V9ATBnUI/s320/Figure%2B2%2B-%2BNondefense%2Bspending.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So far, it would seem that either the government&#8217;s changes to nondefense spending growth were a big determinant of real economic growth, or there&#8217;s one heck of a coincidence, particularly since I didn&#8217;t exactly &#8220;fit&#8221; the nondefense function.</p>
<p>But as I noted earlier in this post, after the first two graphs, I would step things up a notch. That means I&#8217;m going to show that the fit is even tighter than it looks based on the two graphs above. And I&#8217;m going to do so with a comment and a third graph. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the comment: 1933 figures do not provide information about how the New Deal programs worked. After all, the figures are midyear &#8211; so the real GDP growth would be growth from midyear 1932 to midyear 1933. But FDR didn&#8217;t become President until March of 1933. </p>
<p>So&#8230; here&#8217;s Figure 2 redrawn, to include only data from 1934 to 1938.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pJb-QAzuvCs/TsrF7ZYm7hI/AAAAAAAAAro/jZ9F-XhuGI8/s1600/Figure%2B3%2B-%2BNondefense%2Bspending.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-pJb-QAzuvCs/TsrF7ZYm7hI/AAAAAAAAAro/jZ9F-XhuGI8/s320/Figure%2B3%2B-%2BNondefense%2Bspending.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>While I&#8217;m a firm believer in the importance of monetary policy, for a number of reasons I don&#8217;t believe it made much of a difference in the New Deal era. As Figure 3 shows, changes in nondefense spending &#8211; hiring people to build roads, dams, and the like, explain subsequent changes in real GDP growth rates exceptionally well from 1934 to 1938. This simple model explains more than 90% of the change in real GDP growth rates over that period. </p>
<p>Of course, after 1938, the relationship breaks down&#8230; but by then the economy was on the mend (despite the big downturn in 1938). More importantly (I believe &#8211; haven&#8217;t checked this yet!), defense spending began to become increasingly important. People who might have been employed building roads in 1935 might have found employment refurbishing ships going to the Great Britain in 1939. </p>

                                <p>by <strong>><a href="http://presimetrics.com/">Mike Kimel</a></strong></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been writing about the relationship between tax rates and growth since I started blogging in 2006. A lot of those posts have focused on the quadratic relationship between tax rates and growth. That is, it turns out that if you take US data going back to when the BEA started keeping track, 1929, you can easily build a model of the following form:</p>
<p>% change in real GDP from t to t+1 = a + b*Top Marginal Tax Rate at time t<br />+ c* Top Marginal Tax Rate squared at time t </p>
<p>I have modestly referred to that as the Kimel curve. Now, it turns out that for most variations on that theme I&#8217;ve come up with, b is positive, c is negative, and both are significant at the 5% or 10% level. That allows you to find a top marginal tax rate that maximizes growth&#8230; which turns out to be somewhere between 60% and 70% depending on how the model is specified.</p>
<p>In this post I want to address a few criticisms by running two additional regressions with more or less the form. Parts of this may get a bit wonky but I&#8217;m going to keep it so that even if you&#8217;ve never done any statistical analysis, hopefully you&#8217;ll be able to follow the outcomes.</p>
<p>In the first regression, I&#8217;m going to account for a few additional facts:<br />1. By going with every single observation the BEA produces, I&#8217;ve been accused of &#8220;cherry picking.&#8221; So I&#8217;m going to throw in a dummy variable for Hoover. <br />2. I&#8217;ve been told the only reason growth was so quick during the New Deal was that there was a bounceback effect from the Great Depression&#8230; so I&#8217;m throwing in a dummy variable for FDR&#8217;s peacetime years (i.e., 33-41).<br />3. I&#8217;ve been told WW2 biases the results&#8230;. so there&#8217;s a third dummy for 1942-1944, the fast growing years in WW2. <br />4. I&#8217;ve also included two demographic variables: the percentage of Americans 35 to 44 and the percentage of Americans 45 &#8211; 54. The latter group tends to be the highest income group these days, but in an earlier era more focused on manual labor, those 35 to 44 might have been higher paid. <br />5. For grins, I threw in a dummy variable which is equal to 1 if the President is a Republican and 0 otherwise. </p>
<p>So&#8230; here&#8217;s what it looks like:
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rOgMAImqGFw/Tqh1Mcp8S3I/AAAAAAAAAoU/xtQwc6aeAw8/s1600/figure%2B1%2B-%2Bkitchen%2Bsink.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-rOgMAImqGFw/Tqh1Mcp8S3I/AAAAAAAAAoU/xtQwc6aeAw8/s320/figure%2B1%2B-%2Bkitchen%2Bsink.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So what does it all mean? Well, this set of variables explains about 43% of the observed variation in growth rates over the period for which we have data (see the adjusted R2). There&#8217;s obviously room to improve the model, variables I&#8217;m not accounting for, etc.</p>
<p>The percentage of Americans 35 to 44 has a positive coefficient and is almost significant at 10%. We&#8217;re almost at the point where we&#8217;d be comfortable saying as that percentage increases, growth increases. The percentage of Americans 45 &#8211; 54 has a negative coefficient, but isn&#8217;t close to being significant. </p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Hoover dummy is associated with economic shrinkage, FDR&#8217;s peacetime period is associated with positive growth, and 1942 &#8211; 1944 is associated with even faster economic growth.</p>
<p>The Republican dummy is not significant &#8211; any difference in the growth rate observed between the two parties can be explained by other factors. Which other factors?</p>
<p>Well, the top marginal tax rate and the top marginal tax rate squared are both significant &#8211; the former is positive and the latter is negative, which means they trace out the desired upside-down-U shape. </p>
<p>Oh&#8230; and the top of the curve happens when tax rates are at 64%. That is, the fastest growth rates seem to occur when the top marginal tax rate is around 64%. Now, I&#8217;ve had post after post on this topic, and the top of the curve always seems to occur in more or less in the same place. It isn&#8217;t a coincidence folks. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll post results of the second regression in my next post in the series. That regression will focus on the period since Reagan took office and thus will only include data from 1981 to the present. What does it say? Well, a hint: if you don&#8217;t like the results shown in this post, you won&#8217;t be happy about that one either. But remember, I&#8217;m just the messenger. The data is what the data is, and if it isn&#8217;t showing what you think it should, its up to you figure out what&#8217;s wrong with the analysis or with the data, to pontificate wisely and inaccurately, to ignore the evidence, or to change your mind. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>If anyone has a line on a good inequality series with annual data that goes back to 1929, please let me know. I&#8217;d like to drop it into the model. I&#8217;d also love a good proxy for regulation. Don&#8217;t be afraid to offer other suggestions for data to drop into the mix are welcome too. I&#8217;m like a DJ, I take requests, but it helps if you can point to whatever data you want me to use. </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>As always, if you want my spreadsheets drop me a line at &#8220;mike&#8221; period &#8220;kimel&#8221; (note &#8211; one m only in my last name!!!!) at gmail.com.</p>

<p>German industry is plugging away. Ending in August, the 3-month average of the seasonally- and calendar-day adjusted <a href="http://www.bundesbank.de/statistik/statistik_zeitreihen.en.php?lang=en&#038;open=konjunktur&#038;func=row&#038;tr=BBDE1.M.DE.Y.BAA1.A2P100000.G.C.I05.A">volume of industrial production </a>(excluding construction) maintained a quick 8.3% annualized pace. Even if this core measure of industrial activity falls another 1% in September, the Q3 quarterly annualized pace would be 10.5% &#8211; a robust acceleration from Q2 (6.3%). This suggests that the German economy quickened in Q3 – does that mean it’s all clear for the Euro area?</p>
<p>I think not.</p>
<p>According to The Wilder View Leading Economic Indicator (TWV-LEI), the annual pace of German manufacturing is set to slow quickly, if not contract, by the end of this year. (I constructed my own indicator ﻿since the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/2/50/48843684.pdf">OECD indicators </a>are generally lagged by two months.)  In September, five of the seven components that drive the index confirm a sharp deterioration in economic activity (the final two indicators have not been released yet). This downward trend in TWV-LEI for Germany has been in play since August 2010 and is yet to be fully reflected in industrial production (IP); that will change.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2011/10/leading_indicator_chart.jpg"><img alt="" src="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/files/2011/10/leading_indicator_chart.jpg" width="600" height="400"></a></p>
<p>The chart above illustrates The Wilder View’s leading indicator for Germany (TWV-LEI, Germany). <a name="more"></a> TWV-LEI is a composite of the following variables: PMI manufacturing, Ifo business climate index, manufacturing orders, employment opportunities index, inflation expectations, consumer confidence, and the terms of trade. I’ve found that these indices have the highest correlation with current economic activity, which is measured by industrial production. The r^2 of a simple univariate regression of annual industrial production growth on the 5-month ahead leading indicator (annual growth) reveals an 81% correlation – Implied IP is the fitted dynamics of this univariate regression. Unless leading surveys improve dramatically, I expect the German economy to soften much further in coming months.</p>
<p>Using the 1993-2011 time series, the precipitous drop in the TWV-LEI portends a sharp slowdown in German industrial activity, even contraction by December 2011. The implication is that German economic activity, while accelerating in Q3, is likely to contract in Q4.</p>
<p>The policy ramification is clear: It’s going to get a lot more difficult to sell a<a href="http://www.economonitor.com/rebeccawilder/2011/10/10/expect-neither-%E2%80%98sustainable-nor-comprehensive%E2%80%99-from-euro-area-leaders/">‘comprehensive solution’</a> if the leading Euro area economy is in recession.</p>

                                <p>President Clinton introduces the panelists, noting that there is a UN discussion of Libya scheduled for 10:00 a.m. and that they will have to leave quickly.  First up is Mexican President Felipe Calderón Hinojosa, about whom President Clinton is enthusiastic.
<p>Calderon is less vibrant, but presents an impressive array of detail on Mexico’s unilateral reduction in carbon usage, noting that 26% of the energy used in the country now is from renewable sources.  Part of this has been accomplished by the simple things: a concerted consumer campaign toward replacing old refrigerators and light bulbs with modern ones.</p>
<p>President Calderon notes that much of the problem in developing countries has originated with cutting down the extant trees.  The Cancun meetings resulted in a new international agreement.  Today, we have a new challenge: continuing the Kyoto Protocol.  “Most important agreement and most important instrument”—saying this in front of President Clinton—needs leadership and mobilization of public opinion.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>President Clinton notes that the countries that have been putting major effort into climate change have <em>outperformed</em> the United States in jobs, growth, and reducing income inequality.</p>
<p>President Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of South Africa, notes that “we all agree that climate change is a danger” and that “we need to work together to address the challenges.”  The people on the ground—the voters—see this as a direct matter of life and death; it is the leadership that is needed in Durban.</p>
<p>Jens Stoltenberg, the Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Norway, says that he would not have believed you if you had told him ten years ago that emissions trading in Europe would be possible. Need to have legal agreements, not just a Durban-style reiteration of Kyoto and Copenhagen. (Those of us who were talking about trading energy and weather derivatives twenty years ago probably should be less amazed at this statement than I am.)</p>
<p>President Clinton asks how to work toward energy use reduction in developing countries. The Prime Minister of Grenada, Tilman Thomas, addresses this, mostly by noting a “moral responsibility” to the people of his country. President Clinton notes, repeating what he said last night, that of all of the Caribbean countries, only Trinidad produces any of the carbon-based energies—all other countries have to import oil and natural gas at great cost.  If there were financing available, could expand alternative sources: solar, hydro, and sugar-ethanol, for instance.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister of Slovenia, Danilo Türk, notes that there is Global Governance taking place without global government. Carbon tax would be good because it makes costs predictable. “Very fundamental long-term development challenge,” need to find the “appropriate public funds for transformative technologies now,” following the German solar precedent.</p>
<p>(President Clinton noted that the sun shines in Germany “as much as it does in London.”  I take this to mean that it is not a bright, cheerful country.)</p>
<p>Bangladeshi Prime Minister Hasina echoes the sentiment expressed by several others:  there needs to be a <em>legal requirement.</em> She notes that 20% of the land of her country will be eliminated as the current trend runs.  President Clinton adds The Maldives and even Afghanistan to the list of places that will have to do more and more with less and less (land and resources).</p>
<p>Prime Minister of Mali Cissé Mariam Kaïdama Sidibé notes that one of the biggest problems facing her country is “brain drain” to the United States and Europe. </p>
<p>European Commission President José Manuel D. Barroso notes that many countries have taken individual steps, but that much more is needed to reach the 2 degrees C target—currently on target for only about 60% of that.  “Transparency is key.” Have two very important alliances: science, which is on our side, and public opinion, which should be.</p>
<p>President Calderon has been leading in reforestation; planted about half (500MM) of the trees U.N. Secretary General requested—and collaterally made Mexico City a better place to live.  Tells a story about Tanzania, in which a village grew trees for carbon credits: and gave back more than half of that to get more people in the village a better life.  (I suspect this is an example of <a href="http://underbelly-buce.blogspot.com/2011/09/graebers-debt.html">what David Graeber is talking about when he notes that communal obligation has always preceded—and generally superseded—economic theory</a>.)</p>
<p>President Clinton also notes that the U.S. Senate is now only 50% “global warming deniers.”  He apologizes for that, but notes that it is progress from the 95-0 vote against the Kyoto Treaty.</p>
<p>I believe that is also the only time the phrase “global warming” was used in the entire discussion.  It was almost as if people were afraid to note that the changes are of our own doing, not just the Earth getting mad.</p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Individual Income Tax Rates on the Economy, Part 6: 1981 &#8211; 1993</strong> </p>
<p>This post is the sixth in a series that looks at the relationship between real economic growth and the top individual marginal tax rate.  The first looked at the period from 1901 to 1928, the second from 1929 to 1940, the third from 1940 to 1950, the fifth looked at 1950 &#8211; 1968, and the sixth from 1968 to 1988.  Because the Reagan era is so pivotal in the American psyche, though it was covered in the last post, I intend to focus on it again.  The last post included the lead in to Reagan&#8217;s term, this post contains the follow-up to his term.  In this post I&#8217;ll look at the period from 1981 to 1993.  </p>
<p>Before I begin, a quick recap&#8230;  both the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1901 &#8211; 1928 period</a> and the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_22.html">1929 &#8211; 1940</a> failed to show the textbook relationship between taxes and growth.  In fact, it seems that for both those periods, there was at least a bit of support for the notion that growth was faster in periods of rising tax rates than in periods when tax rates were coming down.  It is worth noting that growth from 1933 to 1940 was generally quite a bit faster than at any other peacetime period since data has been available, both on average and for individual years.  Not quite quite what people believe, but that&#8217;s what it is.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_29.html">1940 &#8211; 1950</a> period, we did observe slower economic growth following a tax hike and faster economic growth followed a tax reduction.  However, that happened when the top marginal tax rate was boosted above 90%.  <br />Interestingly enough, though the so-called &#8220;Kennedy Tax Cuts&#8221; are often used as one of the prime exhibits on the benefits of cutting taxes, a look at the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1950 &#8211; 1968</a> period yields no such conclusion.  Growth rates were already rising before the tax cuts occurred in 1964 and 1965, reached a peak when the tax cuts took place, and started shrinking immediately afterwards. The other period that is always pointed to as evidence that tax cuts spur growth is the Reagan years, which showed up in the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/09/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_1325.html">1968 &#8211; 1988</a> post.  It turns out that put into context, the Reagan years produced one year of rapid but not particularly extraordinary growth a few years after tax cuts began.  That&#8217;s it.  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Real GDP figures used in this post come from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis.</a>  Top individual marginal tax rate figures used in this post come from the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>.  As in previous posts, I’m using growth rate from one year to the next (e.g., the 1980 figure shows growth from 1980 to 1981) to avoid “what leads what” questions. If there is a causal relationship between the tax rate and the growth rate, the growth rate from 1980 to 1981 cannot be causing the 1980 tax rate.  Let me stress this point again as I&#8217;ve been getting people e-mailing me to tell me I&#8217;ve got the growth rates shifted a year.  That is correct, and is being done on purpose (and is shown on the graph labels).  To avoid questions of causality, the growth rate in year X used in this post is the growth rate from year X to year X+1.  And when I say &#8220;to avoid questions of causality&#8221; &#8211; you&#8217;d be amazed at how many people write me when I don&#8217;t do this and insist that sure, higher tax rates seem to be correlated with faster growth, but that&#8217;s because when growth is faster governments feel more willing to charge higher tax rates.</p>
<p>With the preliminaries out of the way, let&#8217;s get started.  The first graph shows the tax rates from 1981 to 1993 along with the t to t+1 real GDP growth rates.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mUizk7USxg/Tm1ODoiD7lI/AAAAAAAAAtI/CoYppBxqLJA/s1600/Figure_1_-_1981_-_1993.jpg"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_mUizk7USxg/Tm1ODoiD7lI/AAAAAAAAAtI/CoYppBxqLJA/s320/Figure_1_-_1981_-_1993.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that what the graph does not, repeat, does not show is that lower tax rates have much to do with faster economic growth.  In fact, some of the slowest sustained economic &#8220;growth&#8221; that occurred during the Reagan-Bush years coincided with the lowest tax rates:  28% and 31%.  The one standout year occurred when tax rates were at 50%, and had been at 50% for a few years.  And yet, somehow this period has entered the public consciousness as Exhibit A that Tax Cuts Work.  </p>
<p>That said, I&#8217;d like to point out that unlike the folks who venerate Reagan today, Reagan himself did have a reason, an excellent reason, in fact, to try tax cuts&#8230; at least the first round of tax cuts.  Looking back from the vantage point of 1980 and leaving out the WW2 years, real economic growth when tax rates were in the 90% + range was lower than it was when tax rates were in the 80% to 89.9% range, and that was slower than when tax rates were in the 70% to 79.9% range, and that in turn was slower than when tax rates were in the 60% to 69.9%.  That is shown in the graph below.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O2fwRwsWdSI/Tm1OYbsuqPI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/Kk4hp-yUxF0/s1600/Figure_2_-_1981_-_1993.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O2fwRwsWdSI/Tm1OYbsuqPI/AAAAAAAAAtQ/Kk4hp-yUxF0/s320/Figure_2_-_1981_-_1993.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>Note that all the information contained in Figure 2 was available by the time Reagan took office.  If the information in Figure 2 is all you have,  it isn&#8217;t unreasonable to wonder whether further reductions in the tax rate will lead to faster economic growth.  Of course, Reagan did have a bit more information available.  He also had growth rates from the last time tax rates were in the 24% and 25% range  (i.e., the start of the Great Depression) which were negative&#8230; and which might have tipped him off that the relationship between tax rates and growth is actually quadratic.  But I guess its a bit much to expect any of Reagan&#8217;s advisors to consider anything like a <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/24732335">quadratic relationship</a>. </p>
<p>In any case, we can combine Figures 1 and 2 to put the Reagan &#8211; Bush rates into context:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uAgbprfASbo/Tm1QByAQpyI/AAAAAAAAAtY/7ALYtKzMX1k/s1600/Figure_3_-_1981_-_1993.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-uAgbprfASbo/Tm1QByAQpyI/AAAAAAAAAtY/7ALYtKzMX1k/s320/Figure_3_-_1981_-_1993.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 3.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re wondering, during seven of the 12 Reagan-Bush years, growth rates were actually below the average rate observed when top marginal tax rates were above 90%&#8230; and the really slow growth during the Reagan &#8211; Bush era occurred disproportionately when tax rates were at the 28% and 31%.  That is to say, when tax rates were at their lowest levels in the Reagan &#8211; Bush era, growth rates were also at their lowest.   And as the graph also shows, every single year, repeat, every single year of the Reagan Bush had a lower average growth rate than when tax rates were in the 60% to 69.9% range.  </p>
<p>So&#8230;  what we don&#8217;t from the Reagan &#8211; Bush era is anything that supports the notion that lower tax rates correlate with faster economic growth.  (Note&#8230; correlation does not imply causality, but lack of correlation certainly does imply lack of causality.)  We do see that it could have been a rational experiment for Reagan to cut tax rates from 70% to 50%.  It was not a rational experiment, based on what happened at 50%, to cut rates further, and the result was easily predictable.  </p>
<p>And speaking of rational&#8230;  the story the data tells is strongly at odds with what is commonly believed.  And this isn&#8217;t ancient history.  Most of us lived through this.  It isn&#8217;t rational for us to believe things that aren&#8217;t true.  But collectively, we do.  And its leading to crummy growth rates.  What a surprise.</p>

<p><strong>The Effect of Individual Income Tax Rates on the Economy, Part 5: 1968 &#8211; 1988</strong><br />This post is the fourth in a series that looks at the relationship between real economic growth and the top individual marginal tax rate.

<p>Real GDP figures used in this post come from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis.</a>  Top individual marginal tax rate figures used in this post come from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>.  As in previous posts, I’m using growth rate from one year to the next (e.g., the 1980 figure shows growth from 1980 to 1981) to avoid “what leads what” questions. If there is a causal relationship between the tax rate and the growth rate, the growth rate from 1980 to 1981 cannot be causing the 1980 tax rate.  Let me stress this point again as I&#8217;ve been getting people e-mailing me to tell me I&#8217;ve got the growth rates shifted a year.  That is correct, and is being done on purpose (and is shown on the graph labels).  To avoid questions of causality, the growth rate in year X used in this post is the growth rate from year X to year X+1.  And when I say &#8220;to avoid questions of causality&#8221; &#8211; you&#8217;d be amazed at how many people write me when I don&#8217;t do this and insist that sure, higher tax rates seem to be correlated with faster growth, but that&#8217;s because when growth is faster governments feel more willing to charge higher tax rates.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s get started below the fold:<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s put up a diagram showing growth rates and tax rates for the period from 1968 to 1988.  But we almost don&#8217;t have to do it. We all know what happened.  We&#8217;ve been told so many times.  Tax rates were very high in the late 60s and 70s.  And then came <strikethrough>the Lone Ranger</strikethrough> Reagan, and, and lo, Reagan cut taxes.  The result is that the economy began to grow like never before.  Sure, the story is strikingly similar to the one about the tax cuts in the 1960s, and we know from the last post how that turned out.  But still, the Reagan story is even more widely accepted, so here&#8217;s the graph that accompanies the story:</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B_fasxOfbAc/TmgQ48iMK8I/AAAAAAAAAsw/X7jXyVFVtFc/s1600/partfive1.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="198" width="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-B_fasxOfbAc/TmgQ48iMK8I/AAAAAAAAAsw/X7jXyVFVtFc/s320/partfive1.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Figure 1.</p>
<p>Wait.  That can&#8217;t be right.  Something is wrong with the data because it doesn&#8217;t match the narrative!!!  Yes, there was a tax cut and the economy started growing.  But the only growth that was unusually strong for the time period occurred in one single year, from 1983 to 1984.  And immediately afterwards it dropped and kept dropping.  </p>
<p>In 1987, there was a small pickup in growth which accompanied a further tax cut (50% to 38.5%), but the year after, when the top marginal tax rate dropped further (to 28%), growth fell again. </p>
<p>Strip away the rhetoric, and it would seem the &#8220;evidence&#8221; for the benefits of Reaganomics, for the most part, are that following the small tax cut in 1981 (70% to 69.25%) and the bigger one in 1982 (69.25% to 50%), there was one seemingly extraordinary year of growth from 1983 to 1984.   I could swear the narrative usually isn&#8217;t stated in this way.    </p>
<p>But let&#8217;s take a close-up of the Reagan years and put them (and the one extraordinary year) in perspective.  In the next graph we have the 1980 -1988, but for comparison, I&#8217;ve included the growth rate from 1938 to 1939.  That happens to be the third slowest year of the pre-WW2 New Deal era.  Here&#8217;s what it looks like:</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PG8gOI6EnLo/TmgRWfL_kfI/AAAAAAAAAs4/npXDBW1GAUs/s1600/partfive2.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="198" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PG8gOI6EnLo/TmgRWfL_kfI/AAAAAAAAAs4/npXDBW1GAUs/s320/partfive2.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>Now, you may be able to noodle out why I picked the third slowest year of FDR&#8217;s first 8 years from the graph &#8211; see, it turns out that Reagan&#8217;s best year was faster than FDR&#8217;s worst, and FDR&#8217;s second worst pre-WW2 years, but that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>Redoing Figure 2 and adding in FDR&#8217;s best pre-WW2 New Deal year:  1940 to 1941, produces this graph:</p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gm2TX1GQY7U/TmgRho3OV7I/AAAAAAAAAtA/jPQ9NhAdB9Y/s1600/partfive3.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="198" width="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-gm2TX1GQY7U/TmgRho3OV7I/AAAAAAAAAtA/jPQ9NhAdB9Y/s320/partfive3.jpg"></a></div>
<p>Figure 3.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t look at all like what you learn in school, eh?  How about what you hear on Fox?  Or from El Rushbo?  What about from Rick Perry?  Heck, you don&#8217;t even hear about this from liberals.  </p>
<p>What you will hear is denial, and on the rare occasions where someone is willing to accept the data, excuses.   Now, I&#8217;m sympathetic to the idea that FDR and Reagan were Presidents at very different times, that perhaps FDR had higher potential growth due to a bounceback effect  (I don&#8217;t buy it, but I&#8217;m sympathetic to the idea).  I also don&#8217;t find it offensive if someone states that times and laws were different, and even if Reagan had FDR&#8217;s approach to government in mind, he could never have enacted the same policies that FDR applied.  What I am not sympathetic to are people who tell us about how well Reagan&#8217;s policies worked and who also insist that FDR ruined the economy or made it worse.  People who make such claims  can only fall into two categories, the &#8220;good&#8221; one being the misinformed.  </p>
<p>So to sum up&#8230; so far in this series&#8230;  it seems the evidence has been at least weakly against the idea that tax cuts lead to faster economic growth in the 1901 &#8211; 1928, 1929 &#8211; 1940, and 1950 &#8211; 1968 periods.  The 1940 &#8211; 1950 period does seem to behave consistently with that notion, though it is worth noting that it happened when tax rates were above 90%.  The period from 1950 &#8211; 1968, despite the frequent obfuscatory comments from certain sectors, also completely fails to support the notion that lower tax rates are followed by faster economic growth.  And frankly, the 1970s and 1980s don&#8217;t help the cause either.</p>
<p>Because the Reagan years play such an important role in the way we do economic policy in this country, we&#8217;ll revisit them in the next post in the series.  </p>

<p>This post is the fourth in a series that looks at the relationship between real economic growth and the top individual marginal tax rate.  The first looked at the period from 1901 to 1928, the second from 1929 to 1940, the third from 1940 to 1950.  This week we look at 1950 &#8211; 1968.</p>
<p>Before I begin, a quick recap&#8230;  both the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1901 &#8211; 1928 period</a> and the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_22.html">1929 &#8211; 1940</a> failed to show the textbook relationship between taxes and growth.  In fact, it seems that for both those periods, there was at least a bit of support for the notion that growth was faster in periods of rising tax rates than in periods when tax rates were coming down.  In the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_29.html">1940 &#8211; 1950</a> period, we did observe slower economic growth following a tax hike and faster economic growth followed a tax reduction.  However, that happened when the top marginal tax rate was boosted above 90%.  </p>
<p>There were also a few other findings that might be surprising given the poor acquaintance Americans have with data.  For example, the so-called Roaring 20s were a period in which the economy was often in recession.  The New Deal era, on the other hand, coincided with some of the fastest economic growth rates this country has seen since reliable data has been kept.  Additionally, rather than leading to faster economic growth, the economy actually slowed, a lot, during World War 2.  </p>
<p>Real GDP figures used in this post come from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis.</a>  Top individual marginal tax rate figures used in this post come from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a> [<strong>link fixed</strong>].  As in previous posts, I’m using growth rate from one year to the next (e.g., the 1980 figure shows growth from 1980 to 1981) to avoid “what leads what” questions. If there is a causal relationship between the tax rate and the growth rate, the growth rate from 1980 to 1981 cannot be causing the 1980 tax rate.</p>
<p>Now that the preliminaries are done, if I was following the same pattern I followed in other posts I&#8217;d post a graph showing real GDP growth rates and tax rates.  But this time I&#8217;m going to hold off on that graph for a few more paragraphs.  Instead, I want to discuss an extremely pervasive myth about the period, and how that affects our understanding of economic of the era.  The myth involves the so-called Kennedy Tax Cuts.  Ask most economists and they&#8217;ll tell you:  the economy was in the doldrums until Kennedy cut taxes from 91% to 70%.  After that shot in the arm, growth took off like a shot.  There is a second myth, but it is more confused:  the myth of the idyllic 1950s.  That one says that there was rapid growth in the 1950s because the US had little economic competition, what with the rest of Free World haven&#8217;t been destroyed during World War 2.  It doesn&#8217;t reconcile that well with the Kennedy tax cut myth since, of course, for the Kennedy tax cuts to pull the economy out of the doldrums caused by a 91% tax rate, the economy has to be in the doldrums rather than idyllic when tax rates are 91%.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s look at what happened.  The graph below shows growth rates for the period.  (I&#8217;m not including tax rates quite yet&#8230; that comes later.)</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M5qkVx3U4PE/TmPGSAVaPoI/AAAAAAAAAhs/Tb4FR3mYmC0/s1600/Figure%2B1%252C%2B1950%2B-%2B1968.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-M5qkVx3U4PE/TmPGSAVaPoI/AAAAAAAAAhs/Tb4FR3mYmC0/s320/Figure%2B1%252C%2B1950%2B-%2B1968.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Well, growth rates in the 1950s weren&#8217;t steady.  There were a lot of ups and downs.  During three years in the 1950s, growth rates equaled or exceeded those in Reagan&#8217;s best year.  But it was also a period in which in which there were two recessions (and two more between 1945 and 1950, and another one in 1960) and the economy actually shrunk in two different years.  The 1950s can&#8217;t be characterized as idyllic nor as the doldrums. </p>
<p>Now, there is a point in the graph that seems consistent with the idea that Kennedy did something that was a game changer.  Kennedy took office in January 1961, while the economy was going through the downward part of the cycle we had seen repeated since 1950.  And then&#8230; instead of the economy continuing on its downward trajectory, growth picked up and accelerated (with one blip), staying (mostly) above 5% through about 1965.  LBJ of course, took office when JFK was shot on November 22, 1963 so in this version of history, presumably, the end of the Kennedy boom came about when LBJ started inflicting socialism on us.  The only fly in that ointment to that story, of course, is that while hitting the same growth rate as Reagan achieved in his best ever year was not uncommon in the 1950s when the top marginal tax rate was 91%, it stopped happening after JFK.</p>
<p>Which is all well and good, except for one detail apparent in the graph below which shows both the growth rate and the tax rate:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1-BrR5tPmVg/TmPGSdrckAI/AAAAAAAAAh0/Moagrbe0Sqw/s1600/Figure%2B2%252C%2B1950%2B-%2B1968.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-1-BrR5tPmVg/TmPGSdrckAI/AAAAAAAAAh0/Moagrbe0Sqw/s320/Figure%2B2%252C%2B1950%2B-%2B1968.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>As figure 2 shows, the cut in the top marginal rate occurred in 1964 (91% to 77%) and 1965 (77% to 70%).  Yes, the Kennedy tax cuts were pushed through by LBJ after Kennedy was dead, and  growth rates had already been fast and getting faster for several years before they occurred.  Worse, real growth in the 1960s reached their peak &#8211; the acceleration that had begun years earlier all of a sudden came to a halt &#8211; when the tax cuts occurred.  For the remainder of LBJ&#8217;s term, growth remained strong, but not as strong as it had been earlier.  For instance, the average of the annual growth rates of the 1961 to 1962, 1962 to 1963, and 1963 to 1964 years when tax rates were 91% was 5.41%.  The average from 1966 to 1967, 1967 to 1968, and 1968 to 1969, after the tax rates were dropped was 3.49%.  (Yes, I know, in his last year LBJ raised tax rates back to 75.25%, but even then it was well below the 91% before the tax cuts.)  </p>
<p>This is not, repeat, remotely consistent with the myth I keep hearing about the Kennedy tax cuts.</p>
<p>So far in this series&#8230;  it seems the evidence has been at least weakly against the idea that tax cuts lead to faster economic growth in the 1901 &#8211; 1928, 1929 &#8211; 1940, and 1950 &#8211; 1968 periods.  The 1940 &#8211; 1950 period does seem to behave consistently with that notion, though it is worth noting that it happened when tax rates were above 90%.  Next post in the series:  1968 &#8211; 1980.  </p>
