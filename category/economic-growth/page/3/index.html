<p>This post is the third in a series that looks at the relationship between real economic growth and the top individual marginal tax rate.  The first looked at the period from 1901 to 1928, the second from 1929 to 1940.  This one will look at the period from 1940 to 1950.  </p>
<p>Before I begin, a quick recap&#8230;  both the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates.html">1901 &#8211; 1928 period</a> and the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/08/effect-of-individual-income-tax-rates_22.html">1929 &#8211; 1940</a> [link fixed] failed to show the textbook relationship between taxes and growth.  In fact, it seems that for both those periods, there was at least a bit of support for the notion that growth was faster in periods of rising tax rates than in periods when tax rates were coming down.  There were also a few other findings that might be surprising &#8211; the so-called Roaring 20s were a period in which the economy was often in recession.  The New Deal era, on the other hand, coincided with some of the fastest economic growth rates this country has seen since reliable data has been kept.  As we will see in this post, the period from 1940 to 1950, encompassing WW2 as well as the immediate post-war recovery, also is subject to a lot of popular misconceptions. </p>
<p>Real GDP figures used in this post come from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis.</a>  Top individual marginal tax rate figures used in this post come from the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/www.irs.gov/pub/irs-soi/histab23.xls">IRS</a>.  As in previous posts, I’m using growth rate from one year to the next (e.g., the 1980 figure shows growth from 1980 to 1981) to avoid “what leads what” questions. If there is a causal relationship between the tax rate and the growth rate, the growth rate from 1980 to 1981 cannot be causing the 1980 tax rate.<br />
<br />The following graph shows the growth rate in real GDP from one year to the next (black line) and the top marginal tax rate (gray bars) for the period from 1940 to 1950.<br />

<p>

</p>
<p>
<br />Finally, in the fourth decade we looked at in this series so far, we see a graph that doesn&#8217;t contradict textbook economics:  growth seems to slow down as tax rates rise, reaching its lowest point (on the graph) when tax rates peaked.  Then, after tax rates begin to fall, growth picks up again.   So why do we see this negative correlation between tax rates and subsequent growth rates during the 1940 to 1950 period when we saw the opposite in the previous periods? </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Well, as I&#8217;ve pointed out many times in the past, there is a quadratic relationship between tax rates and subsequent growth rates (kind of like the Laffer curve, but with real GDP growth taking the place of tax collections), and the fastest growth tends to occur when the top marginal rate is <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/optimal-tax-rates-for-generating.html">somewhere around 65%</a>.  (At this juncture I have to point out things can be true whether we like them or not.  If you&#8217;re looking for a micro-foundations reason why raising tax rates can create faster economic growth, try <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/simple-explanation-for-strange-paradox.html">this</a>.)  </p>
<p>In any case, tax rates in 1940 were at 79%, and they reached a high of 94% in 1944 and 1945.  Clearly, at 79% the top marginal tax rates were already above optimum, and raising them simply moved them even farther away from the optimum growth rate.  Conversely, cutting tax rates down to the low 80% following the end of WW2 moved tax rates closer to optimum.</p>
<p>But growth does not live by tax rates alone and the graph above hints at a few other misconceptions.  Let&#8217;s start with a big one shared by folks on the left and the right, namely that World War 2 led to faster economic growth.  In fact, many folks go so far as to say the economy suffered very slow growth until the outbreak of WW2, which as we saw in the last post in the series, is a comical claim.   The graph below shows growth rates from 1938 to 1944.  (Remember &#8211; for our purposes, growth is from t to t+1&#8230; thus, growth in 1938 is the percentage change between the 1938 real GDP and the 1939 real GDP.)  As with Figure 2 in the previous post, the best ever year of the Reagan administration is also included for comparison purposes.<br />
</p>
<p>
<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BSznfwpPjUg/TlvZjpm0CPI/AAAAAAAAAg4/bah0HtIGSyo/s1600/Figure%2B2%2B-%2B1940%2B-%2B1950.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-BSznfwpPjUg/TlvZjpm0CPI/AAAAAAAAAg4/bah0HtIGSyo/s320/Figure%2B2%2B-%2B1940%2B-%2B1950.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />
</p>
<p>
<br />Notice&#8230;  growth was already fairly quick from 1938 to 1939, and from 1939 to 1940&#8230; and then it really jumped from 1940 to 1941.  Pearl Harbor was December 7, 1941, so most of that latter jump came before the American entry into the war.  Now, one might say that somewhere around 1938 was the beginning of US involvement in WW2, what with Liberty Ships and the Arsenal of Democracy and all.  Put another way, that big jump in growth came before the US was in the war, but as an administration whose policies had already generated several years of very rapid growth since 1933 took an increasing role in the economy.  Apparently the economic policies followed were good enough to overcome even tax rates that were significantly above optimum.</p>
<p>Growth peaked between 1941 and 1942 and then began to shrink.  In part, as we saw, that was because tax rates got too far above optimum.  In part, on the other hand, it is because too much of the country&#8217;s labor pool was shipped abroad to fight in the war.   But regardless&#8230; if the war had been a catalyst for jumpstarting the economy, the peak would not have occurred when it did&#8230; and growth would not have started accelerating so many years before the country&#8217;s entry into the war..  </p>
<p>There&#8217;s one more myth that is worth tackling.  That myth is that there was some sort of stupendous economic boom following WW2.  And it only makes sense that there would be such a boom &#8211; the GIs came home, tax rates were cut in 1946 and again in 1948, government spending dropped, and rationing and price controls went by the wayside.  And as Figure 1 shows, real GDP had a post-war nadir (I always wanted to use that word!!!) in 1947, and recovered after that.  But it is important to put that recovery into context.  </p>
<p>The graph below shows the rate of growth from 1947 (the bottom) to 1950 &#8211; the post-war miracle, as it were &#8211; and it compares it to the rate of growth from 1933 (the bottom of the Great Depression) to 1936, the heart of the New Deal.<br />
</p>
<p>
<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PuRXzVhsmcQ/TlvZxhmzTYI/AAAAAAAAAhA/J3YLvvrIp8c/s1600/Figure%2B3%2B-%2B1940%2B-%2B1950.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PuRXzVhsmcQ/TlvZxhmzTYI/AAAAAAAAAhA/J3YLvvrIp8c/s320/Figure%2B3%2B-%2B1940%2B-%2B1950.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />
</p>
<p>
<br />As Figure 3 shows, there really is no comparison between the two recoveries.  Whereas during the post war recovery, the economy grew almost 13% over three years following the bottom, it grew almost three times faster following the bottom in 1933.  And from the previous post, we saw what happened during the rest of the 1930s.  We&#8217;ll see what followed the post-War recovery in the next post on this series. </p>

<div>The Financial Armageddon article shows the first chart of the paper which presents:<i>  the relationship between fiscal adjustment episodes and the number of incidents indicating instability (CHAOS).</i></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>

<div>  </div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;CHAOS is the sum of demonstrations, riots, strikes, assassinations, and attempted revolutions in a</div>
<div>single year in each country. The first set of five bars show the frequencies conditional on the size of budget cuts. When expenditure is increasing, the average country-year unit of observation in our data registers less than 1.5 events. When expenditure cuts reach 1% or more of GDP, this grows to nearly 2 events, a relative increase by almost a third compared to the periods of budget expansion. As cuts intensify, the frequency of disturbances rises. Once austerity measures involve expenditure reductions by 5% or more, there are more than 3 events per year and country &#8212; twice as many as in times of expenditure increases.&#8221;  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>This is a rather disturbing chart.  Certainly the recent events in England play into the subject of this paper.   That WE are now setup for our version of austerity implementation, this paper should be put in the hands of all the staff members of congress and the president.   If I had my own national news show I would have in the corner of the screen the above chart along with the google map of all the riot locations in London and in big letters: Cut SS, MC, Medicaid.  Really? You want to go there?</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is more to this paper than just the apparent connection between austerity and upheaval.<i>  &#8220;Controlling for economic growth does not change our results. This suggests that we capture more than the general association between economic downturns and unrest.&#8221;</i></div>
<div></div>
<div>This is the most powerful statement of the paper.  It implies that &#8220;Man&#8221; in all his glory is responsible for such social activity.  It is not the<a href="http://draft.blogger.com/.%20http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/big-washington-consensus-lie-by-david.html"> &#8220;natural&#8221; course</a> of economic activity that creates such volatile activity.  It is the<a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/big-washington-consensus-lie-by-david.html"> economic policy implemented</a>that determines whether there will be unrest or not.  Currently, the proposed austerity is based on an a priori of &#8220;we&#8217;re broke&#8221;.  It is stated with the authority of natural cause.  Mother Nature Economy did it&#8217;s thing and well&#8230;we&#8217;re broke.  All we can do is rebuild after the storm.   Yet, an economy is totally of human design.  The republican who stated that the conservative movement was making reality was more correct than their fantasizing of control and power would allow them to realize.  Thus I delve into this paper more after the jump.  </div>

<hr xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">  
<div>There are two points that need to be understood if we are to apply the lessons of this social economic paper.  Point 1:</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;However, countries with very high levels of constraints on the executive show a weaker degree of association&#8230;Table 10 demonstrates that in countries with better institutions, the responsiveness of unrest to budget cuts is generally lower. Where constraints on the executive are minimal, the coefficient on expenditure changes is strongly negative – more spending buys a lot of social peace.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>So, some kind of governance that includes self determination is a mechanism for minimizing upheaval/unrest.  I believe the American Revolution would be an example of upheaval in the face of “minimal executive” constraint.  Finding that constraint of the executive is determinative does not mean such rights are exercised by the people to their benefit:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;The political economy literature on austerity suggests a paradox. There is no significant punishment at the polls for governments pursuing cut-backs (Alesina, Perotti, and Tavares 1998; Alesina, Carloni, and Lecce 2010), and no evidence of gains in response to budget expansion (Brender and A. Drazen</div>
<div>2008).&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I don&#8217;t know what to make of such findings.  Certainly there must be more in the details of the studies sited.  If such lack of response by the electorate is true, then we are in deeper trouble than realized.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Based on this conclusion, the authors ask: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;Why, then, is fiscal consolidation often delayed, or only implemented half-heartedly?&#8221; </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>They suggest fear of unrest may be the reason and footnote the following: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>14 Alesina, Carloni and Lecce (2010) also suggest that implementation of budget measures may be harder if the burden falls disproportionately on some groups.  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I would hate to think that austerity measures are not implemented simply because of fear of a reprisal that appears to be short lived with no political loss to those implementing the policy  instead of not implementing austerity because research and experience prove it to be actually harmful in it&#8217;s results and even contradictory to the desired outcome of greater prosperity with reduced risk of living.  If the politico is acting based on the former, it show&#8217;s no conviction of ideology and philosophy.  If they fail to acted based on the latter, it shows a lack of character of inquiry and enlightenment.   In either case, Naomi Kline&#8217;s work notes that austerity is always implemented with some form of force.  In our country the force appears to be consolidation and control of the media combined with massive amounts of spending thus control of the debate and knowledge of the subject matter.  Though the police state is in place thanks to Bush/Cheney and the expansion under Obama. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Point 2:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>“Further, we examine if the spread of mass media changes the probability of unrest. This is not the case. If anything, higher levels of media availability and a more developed telecommunications infrastructure reduce the strength of the mapping from budget cuts to instability.&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>In their conclusion they flatly state: <i>Contrary to what might be expected, we also find no evidence that the spread of mass media facilitates the rise of mass protests.   </i></div>
<div></div>
<div>This suggests that cutting communications as some have done recently in an attempt to curb the upheaval is not a procedure that works in the long term.  The focus of the complaint, materialized via upheaval will have to be addressed.  It is not the ease of rallying the masses, the pep squad going viral that solely explains the materialization or degree of unrest.  Though it may explain the reduction in strength of austerity implementation and resulting upheaval.  I think the authors have stumbled upon the modern version of the printing press coming into existence and the effects it had.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The authors review current literature on the subject and find there is some confliction as to the effects of budget cutting.  I&#8217;ll let you read it, but my take home is that it depends on what stage of national development the country is in as to the extent  austerity will produce unrest, if the unrest is sustained post implementation and whether it promotes growth.  They even site:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Giavazzi and Pagano (1990) and Alesina et al. (2002) find that cuts can be expansionary. Amongst the reasons suggested for this finding are a reduction in uncertainty about the course future spending (Blanchard 1990a), and a positive wealth shock as a result of lower taxes in the future (Bertola and Drazen 1993).3  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I guess we know where the current meme comes from.  Unfortunately the authors also note:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>IMF interventions, on the other hand, often led to more frequent disturbances (Morrison, Lafay, and Dessus 1994).</div>
<div>Similarly, Haggard, Lafay and Morrison (1995) find that IMF interventions and monetary contractions in developing countries led to greater instability.</div>
<div>Recently, work by the IMF has suggested that austerity measures may be less expansionary than previously thought; they may well have the standard negative Keynesian effects as a result of lower demand (IMF 2010; Pescatori, Leigh, and Guajardo 2011).</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Oh no!  What is the IMF going to do now?  I&#8217;m still praying for you Greece.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>The author&#8217;s sum up the literature review with:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div><u>Remarkably, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no systematic analysis of how budget cuts affect the level of social instability and unrest in a broad cross-section of developed countries, over a long period.</u></div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Wouldn&#8217;t you think that such research would be considered key to one&#8217;s knowledge base before we start implementing policy that to date has been mostly tried and studied in 3rd world situations?   Wouldn&#8217;t you think that the advising  </div>
<div>the proof of effectiveness from these advising economist?  Even medicine has acknowledged there is a difference between men and women other than genital development.  The review of literature is clear.  Start cutting and you will piss people off such that they express it ultimately in violent means though if you can ride it out the violence abates and prosperity looms until it doesn&#8217;t because people just plain have no money.  The word for today is: Demand.  Use it in a sentence as it relates to this discussion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We can think that there are other issues involved when people protest, but the authors make it clear, austerity brings out the greatest number of people.  For those considering how to handle the masses when the austerity gets implemented:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;The simple correlations suggest that these co-movements do not extend to all indicators of unrest equally – riots, revolutions, and demonstrations decline as expenditure rises, but assassinations and strikes seem – at a first pass – uncorrelated. Similarly, output growth seems to correlate negatively with assassinations, riots, revolutions, and demonstrations, but not with strikes.&#8221; </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>And: &#8220;This suggests that unrest reacts particularly strongly to budget cuts and growth when unrest levels are already high.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Go ahead, implement at your own imperil.  In case you think this connection of unrest/upheaval is related to how they measure it, the authors checked that variable: <i>&#8220;We conclude that the way in which we measure unrest does not matter for our main finding.&#8221;</i></div>
<div></div>
<div>Looking at the relationship of austerity policy involving taxes: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Higher taxes and lower expenditure are associated with more unrest, but the relationship is not significant.  Tax increases have a positive sign, but the effect is not significant at standard levels of rejection (column 2). It is also small – a one standard deviation rise in the tax/GDP ratio increases unrest by less than 0.01 events. Overall, we find that improvements in the budget balance raise the level of unrest (column 3). As the results in columns (1) and (2) make clear, this reflects the impact of expenditure cuts, <i><u>and not of tax increases.</u></i></div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>And:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>We find the same results as before – expenditure cuts wreak havoc, tax increases do so only to a small extent and insignificantly. Overall, the budget balance matters for predicting unrest.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Just to make sure no one gets this wrong:  A change in budget balance predicts unrest if the balance is reduced via cuts.  Kind of makes it difficult to accept that the masses want something for nothing.  In fact, I would suggest “entitlement” as it has come to mean something for nothing is the wrong word to apply to government programs of which people pay for willingly via taxes and don&#8217;t get riotous if they are asked to pay more.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If we wanted to avoid the upheaval of austerity implementation we should consider: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>In all specifications, the effect of GDP growth on unrest is negative. In contrast to the results for expenditure changes, the effect is not tightly estimated, except in the case of demonstrations, when it is also large – every 1% increase in GDP cuts the number of demonstrations by close to 0.4 events.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>See, do something that actually improves the economy and people don&#8217;t protest!  Wow, who&#8217;d a thunk it?  Of course improving the economy such that people do not protest would mean having implemented something which produces an actually experienced improvement in the peoples lives.  Something like real rising wages paralleling productivity rise and thus rising wealth.  Unlike say, debt driven consumption only to have financing go away and then told to suck it up.</div>
<div></div>
<div>They look further at the connection of spending cuts vs economic growth and find:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>In contrast, if expenditure changes are negative, they matter a great deal for unrest, driving up CHAOS by 0.19 incidents for each standard deviation of expenditure cuts. Next, we repeat the exercise for output changes. Increases in output do much to cut unrest (col. 3), with a one standard deviation increase in output (3.77%) reducing CHAOS by 0.2 incidents on average. In contrast, declines do not set off major disruptions to the same degree. Overall, the results in table 12 confirm that the relevant identifying variation for expenditure changes comes from cuts; for output changes, it comes from positive growth, not recessions.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This  paper kind of makes you think about our current governance of Wall Street/Corp influence and apparent dominance of policy choices to the exclusion of polls showing people want no cuts in programs referred to as entitlements and instead have the budget balanced via tax revenue enhancement.  Wonder what happens when virtual people known as corporations do not experience austerity yet have persuading influence over We the people&#8217;s choices via money into the election process.? I guess we are going to find out.  As I have heard in the past: tort is the free market response to lax governance of the market.  Is upheaval the same free market response to unresponsive policy toward the people?</div>
<div></div>
<div>My concern is that the initial response by those supporting and promoting austerity will be the furthering of the police state we have been developing since 9/11.  Only it will also be fired up (pun intended) domestically.  It is the response we have experienced in the past with the civil rights motion and even back to the labor movement.  It appears that a police response is always the first response to protest as protest is interpreted as potentially criminal regardless of what the Constitution reads.  Yet here we have a paper suggesting that all of it can be avoided.  Combining this paper with the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html">2005 World Bank report </a>on what creates wealth in a developed economy it appears to me that we have  in our hands the answer to what appropriate economic policy should look like for our current situation.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>I asked <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/can-we-please-broaden-our-thinking-in.html">September 2008</a> if we could please broaden our discussion regarding the crisis.  That has not happened.  The discussion is still disjointed, segmented and narrow.  Now I&#8217;m imploring that we broaden the discussion.  Pleading! </div>

<div>This sums up the early comments to the post suggesting that those who trusted Obama have only themselves to blame.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I addressed that concept in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/11/obama-is-he-or-isnt-he-real.html">Obama, is he or isn&#8217;t he real&#8230;?</a>  In that post I presented transcripts of Obama&#8217;s speeches and responses to questions and then argued:   </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;Are those talking like Glen Greenwald correct in that people should not be surprised with Obama&#8217;s appointments? Maybe, but then based on the above Obama words, that would mean we (you and I) just plain have to approach our relationship with governing as suspect until proven otherwise. Unfortunately, that means we will always be a day late and a dollar short having never known at the time of the decision if we made the correct one because you can not go by what is said.&#8221;</div>

<div>I recommend people go and not only read the posting, but the comments.  (History is always fun to review.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>I concluded that posting with:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div> &#8220;Do you know what happens to a person when they can never get a straight, no hidden agenda answer from one they count on? They go nuts.&#8221;</div>

<div>This all speaks to the issue of growing our economy, because to promote distrust in a developed economy where 77% of our capital is intangible (via 2005 World Bank study) is to be destroying the prime driver of our growth. I wrote about the issue of were our true wealth comes from a few times.  For this posting I am drawing on<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/02/attention-republicansblue-dog.html"> Attention Republicans/Blue Dog Democrates: Tax cuts as stimulus work against your goal.</a></div>
<div>February 5, 2009.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>From the World Bank study:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>“An economy with a very efficient judicial system, clear and enforceable property rights, and an effective and uncorrupt government will produce higher total wealth.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>I concluded:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div> &#8220;The republicans/blue dogs, and those helping them by lending their &#8220;professionalism&#8221;, think they are only effecting a political strategy. In truth, they are destroying the very basis for the wealth they desire. Their entire campaign for decades to discredit, to instill mistrust in the primary institution we have, the US (We the People) government, has been the primary cause to our economic decline. To increase the level of distrust is to decrease the available “intangible capital” which is 77% of our wealth generating power. &#8220;</div>

<div>Which brings us to what we just experienced with the debt ceiling issue.  It&#8217;s not just the resulting budget changes, it&#8217;s the overall cognitive change being made in the people regarding trust of our ability to access a candidate and make the choice that will produce the desired results.  Clinton, as for the Dems made the first blow to our trust with &#8220;triangulation&#8221;.  I can and have on my own gone back and read speeches and answers to questions by Clinton during his first run and it shows the same as I note regarding Obama in &#8220;is he or isn&#8217;t he real&#8221;.  Obama is (knowingly or not) bringing our trust close to death.   </div>
<div>Even the debt ceiling event is only the latest in a string of recent events that all drive an additional spike into the coffin of &#8220;trust&#8221;.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Last night on Racheal Maddow&#8217;s show, Chris Hayes, noted that we are now in a phase of governance where &#8220;created&#8221; crisis is the vehicle for results.  Yes, Shock Doctrine governance level II..  It was presented from the perspective that the conservative mind set is the one employing such a tactic.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Visit msnbc.com for <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/">breaking news</a>, <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032507">world news</a>, and <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032072">news about the economy</a></div>
<p>
<div></div>
<div>  In my opinion, what he missed, and what makes this a unique form to this nation&#8217;s version of Naomie Klein&#8217;s  Shock Doctrine is that there are enough economically conservative minded people in the opposing party (democratic party in this case) that the ruse can be played out with a more believable presentation than if just one side is playing along.  Yes, both side play it differently, but would that not be expected based on the supposed &#8220;base party&#8221; paradigms?  At no time during any of these &#8220;crisis&#8221; did the primary players on the democratic side resist the crisis by calling it out.  Instead, they used it to get what the conservative faction of the party (a smaller faction since the last election) wants. These &#8220;wants&#8221; being very much inline with the republican non Norquist/Tea Party faction&#8217;s wants.  Commonly referenced as  Wall Street.  In the end, no one to blame&#8230;It was the crisis.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>This pattern has held true through out Obama&#8217;s current term.  In the latest example, the proposed budget from the house progressive caucus, the largest of the democratic party caucuses never was mentioned by the president.  Recall the single payer health insurance issue? </div>
<div></div>
<div>The issue for this posting is not the &#8220;wants&#8221;.  It is not about the resulting policy from the latest ruse played on We the People.  The prime issue, the issue always suggested, implied, bandied about, but never out and out confronted: Public Trust.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>This latest Obama/conservative policy process has brought us closer than ever to the demise of our economy and thus our democracy not primarily by the furthering of the financial disequilibrium, but by the perpetuation and enlarging of the perimeters of social order that will now be distrusted.  I think we have approached, if not completely included the full boundaries of American culture in that which is to be distrusted with the completion of this debt crisis event. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Sadly, I do not think Obama and those referred to as the &#8220;adults in the room&#8221; know what they have done.  Instead. as I stated above, they believe they are just &#8220;effecting a political strategy&#8221;. </div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are 2 versions of distrust.  First is the distrust nurtured by those who have made it a political tool of their strategy for political dominance, power and fortune.  It is the &#8220;&#8230;most dangerous words in the English language: I am from the government and I am here to help you&#8221;.  These people do not know that in essence their distrust is part of the ruse.  The other distrust is those who see the ruse, have acted via those they trusted only to find they can no longer be trusted.  I don&#8217;t believe one is worse than the other, but I do know having both means the solution will be slower in materializing.  In both cases those in power can not be trusted and those who know it, presently have no one in power to represent their solutions.  It serves to make the what is the solution clear, it does not server to make it any easier or quicker in coming. </div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I do not believe this mode of operation is forever simply because we are not naturally selfish, self serving for survival sake creatures. We are not naturally so shallow in our collective thinking.  It is only in our isolated, individual thought that we can and will be shallow.  Of course this assumes that the concepts and application of virtual reality throughout our daily lives does not mutate us way from our natural self.   A big assumption considering &#8220;reality&#8221; is in the phrase &#8220;virtual reality&#8221; and the character dynamic is trust.    </div>

<p><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/07/north-america-has-always-been-wealthier-than-latin-america.html">Tyler Cowen</a> links to this paper by <a href="ftp://ftp.igier.unibocconi.it/wp/2011/402.pdf">this paper by Allen, Murphy and Schneider</a> (warning, PDF!!).  </p>
<p>Cowen notes:</p>
<blockquote><p>It is a common view that North America had to play catch-up, but the extensive data sets in this paper suggest that North American wages were up to twice as high as the general level of wages further south.</p></blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I don&#8217;t know how anyone could be surprised.  I think I covered the topic fairly well <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2006/12/cactus-theory-of-development.html">a few years ago</a> so I&#8217;ll reproduce it in its entirety below.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I mentioned one of my old Professors, Arnold Harberger, a few times in recent posts. I can be argumentative, and I got into a lot of arguments with him. As a general rule, when I argued with Harberger, I was wrong. There is one thing, and one thing only that I can think of that I disagreed with him that to this day I still think I was right about. So here’s that story…</p>
<p>When I finished my comps, I had a few rudimentary germs of ideas I was considering for thesis topics. My favorite was a theory of economic development. I had spent some time thinking about Mexico and Brazil and the United States – each was the flagship, so to speak, of a colonial power, but the first two are charitably described as developing countries, and the last, well, is the United States. </p>
<p>I also thought about the period from World War 2 onward. At the end of the war, much of the world was in pitiful shape. There wasn’t much to differentiate, say, West Germany from East Germany, or Taiwan from China, or South Korea from North Korea, or England or France from Poland or Czechoslovakia. And Mexico and Brazil were probably in better shape than most, if not all of those countries. And yet, 50 years later there were definitely winners and losers among those countries.</p>
<p>So what was the difference? Here’s what I thought… the difference between Mexico and Brazil and the United States in the 1500s had nothing to do with Mexico, Brazil, and the US, but rather with Spain, Portugal, and England. Spain and Portugal were dying empires, and they basically looted everything they could, often destorying much that they couldn&#8217;t loot in the process. England was the most advanced country on earth; it didn’t need anything from the New World, and if anything, there was an outflow of capital (mostly human capital) from England to its colony. </p>
<p>I also thought a bit about Mexico and Brazil and other countries: South Korea, Taiwan, Japan, West Germany, East Germany, Poland, England and China. At the end of World War 2, arguably Mexico and Brazil were in better shape than the other countries I mentioned. South Korea and Taiwan had never been particularly advanced; Japan and West Germany were in ruins. And yet, 50 years later, Mexico and Brazil were lagging behind South Korea and Taiwan and Japan and West Germany. Not so much East Germany and Poland. </p>
<p>What’s the difference? Well… the winners were those that the United States effectively colonized. (And if you don’t think we effectively colonized, say, England, bear in mind there are still US military bases there. As to Taiwan, they were colonized twice – first, when the Nationalists took everything that wasn’t nailed down in China and much that was to Taiwan, and second, with US participation after Quemoy and Matsu. South Korea, Japan, and the rest of Western Europe – I think colonization was self-evident.) In other words, there was an inflow of human capital from the most advanced country on earth. East Germany and Poland were effectively colonized by an empire that was already dying – there was more of a transfer of capital toward that empire (consider reports of Soviet soldiers stealing toilets from German apartment buildings) than the other way.</p>
<p>Now, what is magical about being colonized by whatever the most advanced country on earth? Well… I think it’s a few things. I would imagine that when a country leads the world, it is generally because it has better institutions and a relative strong economic situation. And the institutions, along with capital (human and otherwise) get transferred to the colonies. All of that happened in England and South Korea and so forth, but it did not happen in Mexico or Brazil or Argentina. (Some wag once called them the MBA countries.)</p>
<p>Note that I am not advocating colonization as a way of development. (No “Mouse that Roared” scenario here.) I believe the same effects could be accomplished by copying the institutions from countries that are successful and getting massive infusions of resources.</p>
<p>And yes, I note there are exceptions – places like Luxembourg and the Scandinavian countries – but these seem to have pretty good institutions of their own. Other exceptions include countries where oil was discovered (but an argument could be made the US effectively colonized, if not Saudi Arabia, at least its economy), or one-off special cases; trading posts like Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>Anyway, Harberger thought this didn’t make sense, and wasn’t a good topic, so I scratched it off the list of thesis topics. But it was one of the things about which he didn’t convince me. And its been over a decade and I still think about this now and then, I still believe there’s something to this. Your thoughts? Am I missing something obvious?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I think it holds up reasonably well.  Looking back a few years, I think I didn&#8217;t emphasize enough the transfer of capital and overemphasized human institutions.  As I get older and more cynical, I start to think more and more that the supposedly &#8220;honest&#8221; countries that succeed often have the same corruption as the dishonest ones that don&#8217;t, but success sweeps problems under the rug.</p>
<p>For instance, I&#8217;m starting to think that Brazil is no less corrupt now than it was, say, in 2000, but since then it discovered oil and gas, and its ethanol has become far more valuable due to rising prices of oil and gas.  The Japan that spawned so many scare stories in the American press in the 1980s had a society no different than the Japan of today.  Ditto the Argentina of 1990 and the Argentina of today, the Russia of mid-1990s and the Russia of today, the Baltic Tigers of the late 1990s and the Baltic Tigers of today, etc.  </p>
<p>Capital flows are vital, and they often flow for reasons that are divorced from reality.  (Put another way &#8211; the people who allocate capital don&#8217;t understand the real world any better than anyone else, its just that by allocating capital they do change reality a little bit at least for a time.)</p>
<p>Agree?  Disagree?  What else is this little theory missing?</p>

<p>Being that we&#8217;re about to experience austerity because we are convinced we can&#8217;t spend money properly such that we actually end up with more after rather than less &#8230;  which is very depressing to me and defeatist in presentation, I present my new theme song:  That&#8217;s how it goes.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I just find it fascinating that we will accept the argument that government needs to run as we run our own houses and thus need to not spend more than we have, blah, blah, blah yet we seem not willing to apply the concept that we apply daily in our own household to get ourselves an education, a house, our own business, improvement to our property and self.  We do this all the time because we understand it is building our wealth, and we do it even though we can&#8217;t print our own dollars like the government can.  (Yeah, we&#8217;re not Greece in that way.)</p>
<p>Really, just listen to both sides presenting the austerity program arguments.  Can&#8217;t you hear how disjointed the reasoning is?  Can&#8217;t you hear how selective they are in presenting examples of proof of their argument which is resulting is a totally disjointed line of reasoning.  Ask one question you are told we need to save to prosper.  Ask another question you are told we need to spend less just like you, to prosper.  Ask a third question and you are told we have no money, just like you.  Ask a forth question and we&#8217;re told the economy is growing (more money produced) NOT LIKE YOU.  Ask a fifth question and we are told to better yourself, NOT LIKE WE THE PEOPLE.  Ask a sixth question and we are told to get an education, NOT LIKE WE THE PEOPLE.  Ask a seventh question and we are told to&#8230;(fill in your own).</p>
<p>My favorite verses of the song and why it is my new theme song:</p>
<blockquote><p>I help you and you help me<br />That’s the way the world should  be<br />Tit for tat and give and take<br />Just be good for goodness sake<br />I’ll  pick you up if you should fall<br />It works both ways if it  works at all<br />Hold in your heart the people you love<br />Always thank the powers above<br />Everyone  deserves a share<br />So keep your promise, fair is fair</p>
<p>So gather ‘round me people<br />And help me while I sing this song<br />I’d  rather have you with me<br />Together as we travel along<br />It’s the feeling of the wind in your face<br />The sound of the music they play<br />The  friends you make along the way<br />Don’t you know, that’s how  it goes</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>Tax Rates and Economic Growth Over Ten Year Time Horizons, plus Why a Flat Tax Would Result in Much Slower Economic Growth</strong></p>
<p>Last week I had <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/05/optimal-tax-rates-for-generating.html">a post looking at the the real GDP growth maximizing income tax rate</a> using both top marginal income tax rates and and &#8220;average marginal&#8221; &#8220;all-in&#8221; tax rates for all taxpayers (including those who paid nothing) computed by Barro &#038; Sahasakul.  The post noted that the optimal top marginal rate was in the neighborhood of 64%, a finding that corresponds with many other posts I&#8217;ve written on the topic.  The post also noted that the Barro-Sahasakul rates were not as useful at explaining economic growth as the top marginal income tax rates.  </p>
<p>David Altig of the Atlanta Fed commented on the piece <a target="_blank" href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2011/05/long-short-runs-tax-reform.html">here</a>, but he essentially had one very gently delivered criticism and one follow-up comment.  The criticism is that my post did not consider long run effects &#8211; for each year, it looked at how the tax rate that year would affect growth in real GDP from that year to the next.  The comment was that the post&#8217;s results did not correspond with results of a paper he published in the AER with Auerbach, Kotlikoff, Smetters and Walliser.  (Ungated version <a href="http://www2.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/institute/wpol/html/jprof/aer.pdf">here</a>.  The paper <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<blockquote><p> uses a new large-scale dynamic simulation model to compare the equity, efficiency, and macroeconomic effects of five alternative to the current U.S. federal income tax. These reforms are a proportional income tax, a proportional consumption tax, a flat tax, a flat tax with transition relief, and a progressive variant of the flat tax called the &#8216;X tax.&#8217; </p></blockquote>
<p>In his post, Altig provides this graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BCaSZ8gqdQE/TduslDcjiDI/AAAAAAAAAoA/6Fulquen95M/s1600/taxreforms1.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BCaSZ8gqdQE/TduslDcjiDI/AAAAAAAAAoA/6Fulquen95M/s320/taxreforms1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1.</p>
<p>The graph shows that according to the Altig et. al simulation model, after about ten years, the growth maximizing tax (among the types they simulated) is a flat tax.  I read the paper this afternoon, and while I have a few small quibbles (some of them raised by the authors themselves, to their credit), having done a bit of simulation work myself, I think there is one thing that is worth mentioning and which I can cover in this forum: results of a simulation must fit known facts.</p>
<p>Now&#8230; I think there is a quick and dirty way regression that can account for both a long range analysis and to test the notion of whether the cause of rapid economic growth is best served by a progressive tax system or a flat tax.   Here&#8217;s what I have in mind:</p>
<p>equation 1:  annualized growth in real GDP, t to t+10 = f(top marginal income tax rate, top marginal income tax rate squared, bottom marginal income tax rate, bottom marginal income tax rate squared)</p>
<p>The quadratic terms allow us to find the growth maximizing tax rates, as I&#8217;ve done in so many posts before.  And by including both top and bottom marginal rates, we can compute the optimal growth maximizing top marginal rate and the growth maximizing bottom marginal rate.  And&#8230;  if a flat tax is the best tax, the optimal bottom rate should be more or less equal to the optimal top rate.   </p>
<p>As in the previous post, data ran back to 1929, the first year for which <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">real GDP</a> was computed by the BEA.  Top marginal and bottom marginal rates came from the <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175910,00.html">IRS Statistics of Income Table 23</a>. </p>
<p>So here are the results, as spit out by Excel.  </p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IgjIfr_lMBE/TdusrZj2pOI/AAAAAAAAAoI/icinwO0XOEw/s1600/taxreforms2.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IgjIfr_lMBE/TdusrZj2pOI/AAAAAAAAAoI/icinwO0XOEw/s320/taxreforms2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>What this tells us is that each of the components of equation 1 are significant.  For top marginal rates, we have the expected shape, and if you work it out (either with calculus or by plugging the numbers into a spreadsheet) you&#8217;ll find that the model claims the optimal rate is about 67%, and that getting tax rates there from the current 35% would add about 1.4% a year to real GDP growth.  </p>
<p>For the bottom marginal income tax rate, things are a bit more complicated&#8230; it turns out that the expected quadratic shape isn&#8217;t there.  In fact, the model indicates that tax rates should be as low as possible.   In the range from 0 to 100, 0 is best.  The model also provides support for the Milton&#8217;s Friedman negative income tax rate, though I&#8217;d say results are bit shakier there as rates were never at or below zero during the sample for which we have data.  If I were to do it again, I think I&#8217;d specify the bottom marginal rate differently &#8211; no quadratic shape &#8211; but right now I gotta go.  I would note &#8211; I&#8217;d also add a few other variables, both to account for the small degree of patterns that appear in the residuals and frankly, just to make the model more realistic.  But its fairly clear &#8211; especially since I keep getting results that more or less the same no matter how I approach the problem, that better specification wouldn&#8217;t change the results all that much.  They might push estimates of the top marginal rate down a bit, but its fairly clear that top marginal rates well above where they are now will lead to much faster economic growth.</p>
<p>And of course, the other thing we learn&#8230;  because the effect of top and bottom rates are so very different, and relative to where they are now, pull economic growth in different directions, it makes no sense for the top rate and the bottom rate to be in close vicinity.  Put another way &#8211; a flat tax is a very bad idea, at least when it comes to generating economic growth.</p>

<p>This is an interview of Joseph Stiglitz on Democracy Now regarding his article in the current Vanity Fair.  He discuss the issue of income inequality, taxes, etc and how it has set us up to be less of a land of oportunity than what old Europe was.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A few quotes: <br />
<blockquote>The question was, if people were getting rewards for contributing to our society, a theory that was in the 19th century called &#8220;marginal-productivity theory,&#8221; then you could say, &#8220;OK, those who contribute more should get more.&#8221; But what we saw in that crisis was that these titans of the financial industry got mega-bonuses while their companies were making mega-losses.</p>
<p>And with this one percent getting so much, there’s only one place really to get that extra revenue. The good news is it’s relatively easy. You have 25 percent—almost 25 percent of the income in the upper one percent, you raise their taxes by a few percentage points, and you get an awful lot of money.</p>
<p>This raises a very important point that I raise in my article, which is that much of the wealth of this one percent comes not from hard work, not from innovation, but from good investments in Washington, investing in political capital.</p></blockquote>

<p><strong>How Tax Rates Affect Investment and Consumption  &#8211; A Look at the Data</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=301">Presimetrics blog</a> </p>
<p>This post looks at how changes in the top marginal tax rates affect peoples’ decisions on how much to consume and invest.  Ask a libertarian or conservative economist and the answer is obvious – raising tax rates on high income individuals dissuades them from doing productive things – that is to say, it causes them to cut back on working and investing.  In the interest of avoiding strawmen at all costs, many libertarians and conservatives might assume that a hike in the tax rates on such individuals can also cause them to cut back on consumption.  After all, if tax rates are raised high enough, perhaps people won’t have enough left over to consume as much as they otherwise would.  However, the reduction in voluntary activities that take effort (i.e., work, investment) should easily swamp the reduction in consumption, some amount of which is needed for simple survival.  Put another way, as tax rates rise the ratio of investment to consumption should fall.  </p>
<p>That right there is what’s known as a testable implication, and there’s data aplenty for that purpose.  But before we move on to testing this, let me note that the first paragraph actually provides a second, far more familiar testable implication, namely that higher tax rates will generally lead to slower economic growth.  While that particular narrative seems to be widely believed even by non-economists, it certainly isn’t borne out by US data from the last eight decades or so:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TTyG8ji6arI/AAAAAAAAAgs/KJfOd0aT6wc/s1600/mediangrowth.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TTyG8ji6arI/AAAAAAAAAgs/KJfOd0aT6wc/s400/mediangrowth.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 1</p>
<p>(Figure 1 first appeared in <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=278">this post</a>.)   </p>
<p>The graph shows that, at least until top marginal tax rates get somewhere above 50% (a bit more precision available <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=294">here</a>), increasing those rates does not correlate with slower economic growth, but rather with faster increases in real GDP.  In fact, raising top marginal tax rates <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=253">doesn&#8217;t have many of the effects many people seem to expect</a> (And incidentally, its worth noting that <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=297">state level data </a> also produces <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=105">results the Chicago school and most libertarians don&#8217;t expect</a>.)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now, the reason I mention the data’s irresponsible failure to abide by conservative and/or libertarian philosophies when it comes to tax rates and growth is because I think the relationship between tax rates and economic growth can be at least partly explained by the relationship between tax rates and investment.  As I stated <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=261">here</a>, in my opinion, higher tax rates can lead to more investment.  After all, one way a person who owns a business (large or small) can reduce the taxes they pay on profits is to reinvest the profits, which in turn leads to faster economic expansion.  Furthermore, the incentive to avoid taxes and reinvest increases as tax rates increase.  Of course, at some point, tax rates get high enough to encourage individuals to reinvest even though the “benefits” from more reinvestment, at the margin, are negative.  Where that happens, I don’t know, but based on Figure 1, my guess is that it takes a top marginal tax rate above 50%.  </p>
<p>So…  here’s what libertarians and conservatives should expect to see:  as the top marginal tax rises, the ratio of investment to consumption falls.</p>
<p>Here’s what I expect to see:  the relationship between the top marginal tax rate and the ratio of investment to consumption is somewhat curved.  For top marginal tax rates between 0 and some point X (where X > 50%), an increase in the top marginal rate leads to an increase in investment/consumption.  After that, as the top marginal rate rises, we should investment/consumption level off, and for even higher marginal rates, investment/consumption should fall.</p>
<p>So… using top marginal rates from the IRS&#8217; Statistics of Income <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175910,00.html">historical table 23</a>, and national investment and consumption figures from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis’ National Income and Product Accounts <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=5&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaB">table 1.1.5</a>, we can construct this little graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TTyG87O6GKI/AAAAAAAAAg0/P-fD752l0Fg/s1600/mediangrowth2.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TTyG87O6GKI/AAAAAAAAAg0/P-fD752l0Fg/s400/mediangrowth2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 2</p>
<p>It’s not a perfect quadratic curve, but it sure looks a lot more like what I had in mind than what any conservative or libertarian would expect.  FYI, the correlation between the top marginal tax rate the ratio of investment to consumption for top marginal tax rates below 50% is 55%.  That is to say, an increase in tax rates increases the ratio of investment to consumption when tax rates are below 50%.  On the other hand, the correlation is a negative 11% when tax rates are above 50%.  That is to say, increasing tax rates when they are above 50% has a (not particularly strong) negative effect on people’s “invest v. consume” decision.  </p>
<p>Put another way – conservatives and libertarians have a very, very flawed theory of the world.  At the very least it does not conform at all with historical US data.  At all.  Which of course has serious consequences; because that theory is somewhat dominant in the political sphere, and has been since the late 60s.  The end result – slower economic growth for all of us since the late 60s.  That has real consequences for real people – 310 million of us.  That should have repercussions for the consciences of economists who peddle this garbage, though apparently it doesn’t.</p>
<p>But that’s for another post.  Today, I want to remain clinical.  So… what does Figure 2 mean, with respect to Figure 1?  It means that, yes, at least until a certain point (somewhere above 50%), raising the top marginal rate both increases the ratio of investment to consumption and the real economic growth rate.  Its not outlandish to assume that increasing investment is one of the factors that can increase real economic growth.  (Worth exploring more in a post sometime in the future.)  Other things matter, of course, but I think investment is up there among factors that matter.</p>
<p>It also means that since we’re keeping tax rates at the level they’ve been for the past decade or so, we shouldn’t expect sustained rapid investment or economic growth any time soon.  Don’t expect the 60s or even the 70s again any time soon – we’re in end of the 80s and 00s level taxation, and over the long haul, we’re in for that sort of growth too.  </p>
<p>A few closing remarks:</p>
<p>1.   1.     This post was partly inspired by an interview I had with <a href="http://www.electricpolitics.com/faq.html">George Kenney of Electric Politics</a>.  It was a really useful and interesting conversation for me, in part because he pressed me a bit past my comfort level.  I understand he’ll have that interview up in a few weeks.</p>
<p>2.   2.     I’ve noticed that a number of the graphs I’ve been putting up are not so much quadratic as a bit bimodal.  I have been thinking about that for the past few days, and I think that will be my next post on this “kimel curve” approach to world I’ve been following lately.  </p>
<p>3.   3.     Please, please, please, please, if you object to something in this post and are planning to bring up Romer and Romer, read <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">this</a> first to save me from being embarrassed on your behalf.</p>
<p>4.   4.    As always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.  </p>
<p>5.   5.    Between the time I finished my spreadsheet and the time I wrote this post, I read this blurb from <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/01/the-great-stagnation-excerpt.html">Tyler Cowen&#8217;s next book</a>.  It might be uncharitable of me, but my first thought was to wonder about the odds a libertarian professor would add two and two together, and whether he could remain libertarian if he inadvertently did.</p>

<p>My aging Subaru had a problem a while back. Leak of transmission fluid; a seal or another failing, leading to steady dripping out. And with little need to open the hood, no gauge—or even an &#8220;idiot light&#8221;—on the dashboard, it dripped for quite a while. And then some.</p>
<p>The first repair—call it Quizzical Effort 1—refilled the fluid, but didn&#8217;t find the leak. So we started driving it again, but were a bit more alert for signs that it was doing things such as slipping out of gear or having trouble accelerating from a stop.</p>
<p>We took it to another, better shop for Quizzical Effort 2 (QE2). There they found the leak itself. We spent a bit more money, but the leak is gone and the transmission fluid stays where it belongs.</p>
<p>But it was without fluid for quite a while, and fluids go into other parts of the system, &#8220;priming the pump,&#8221; as it were, for better operation.</p>
<p>Can we say that my car has made a &#8220;recovery&#8221;? </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The question keeps rearing its &#8220;ugly&#8221; head as the Jobless Recovery moves forward. Even the Optimists (<a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2011/01/recovery.html">Mark Thoma</a>, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/01/the-end-of-procyclical-labor-productivity.html">Brad DeLong</a>) are hesitating in the face of the evidence*; Thoma&#8217;s graphic at the link just previous notes that the current reovery is not just Jobless, it&#8217;s <em>still</em> Job-Reducing, while DeLong tries to dance a line between &#8220;this time is different, just like the last one&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8217;re going to turn this into Structural Unemployment Any Day Now&#8221; while still thinking of rainbows and kittens.</p>
<p>The strongest evidence that the Recovery has begun is the fiat that NBER declared the recovery to have begun. The second-strongest evidence is that there is noticeable growth in the economy** since the date chosen by NBER.</p>
<p>The following graph appears to support NBER&#8217;s declaration. But note the yellow area.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/TTW80m-1xXI/AAAAAAAAAeA/q8eJmjv9pUk/s1600/peaktroughCapUtil.PNG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/TTW80m-1xXI/AAAAAAAAAeA/q8eJmjv9pUk/s320/peaktroughCapUtil.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>If you want to speak of Business Cycles—I don&#8217;t; I consider RBC Theory as its proponents describe it to be the silliness idea this side of phlogiston, but there are those who do, and it&#8217;s a convenient fiction for purposes here—then surely you should speak of a full Cycle. </p>
<p>The return to the level of Capacity Utilization at the end of the previous recession comes not as the recession ends, but four quarters later, a year into the &#8220;recovery.&#8221;***</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s just the Capital side of the equation. Labor is rather more complicated.</p>
<p>It is as if the machine is running again, but has not received a proper tune-up, or any other (&#8220;structural&#8221;) work that needs to return it to peak performance. As John Maudlin <a href="http://www.investorsinsight.com/blogs/thoughts_from_the_frontline/archive/2010/05/22/the-case-for-a-fed-rate-hike.aspx">noted last May</a>, employment rises with income, and income tax receipts were not rising with the &#8220;head-fake&#8221; recovery—&#8221;grass shoots—of that time.</p>
<p>My Subaru used to get around 17-18 mpg (city). Now it&#8217;s closer to 15-16. It would require an investment of capital and labor to get it completely repaired. Being liquidity-constrained, I&#8217;m not going to make that investment until a couple of other things are cleared up—including, but not limited to, the possibility of upgrading to a model built in this century.</p>
<p>Similarly, capital recovery is a slow process, and incremental labor tends to follow that in productive industries. The gap in capacity at the beginning of the &#8220;recovery&#8221; took 12-13 months to be filled. Given that <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/149542-jobless-recovery-fasten-your-seatbelts">it took 55 months for the Employment/Population Ratio to recover after the 2001 recession</a> (or <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/149542-jobless-recovery-fasten-your-seatbelts">here</a>), it seems not at all unreasonable to expect the current recovery to take 67 or 68 months.</p>
<p>Which would be around January or February of 2015, just after the midterm elections and therefore nearing the end of the first Palin Administration.</p>
<p>It would be rude of me to note that <a href="http://www.nber.org/cycles/cyclesmain.html">the first &#8220;non-recession&#8221; period of the Great Depression lasted only fifty (50) months</a>.  Or that there hasn&#8217;t been a period of growth so long without tax increases since the Vietnam War.</p>
<p>As with my Subaru, some major investment is needed. Whether there will be the liquidity for that to happen in time is left as an exercise.</p>
<p>*Both, in fairness, have declared the current &#8220;recovery&#8221; &#8220;<a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2010/12/economy-still-fragile.html">fragile</a>&#8221; (Thoma) or filled with &#8220;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22unforced+errors%22+site:delong.typepad.com&#038;hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;tbs=qdr:y&#038;prmd=ivns&#038;filter=0">unforced errors</a>,&#8221; but persist in calling it a recovery.</p>
<p>**Let us sidebar that much of that growth is in the FI part of FIRE. If you have assumed that the lion&#8217;s share of the profits generated by an economy should go to those who are supposed to intermediate, you have to deal with the structure you&#8217;ve got, not one that would produce better, or even optimal, growth.</p>
<p>***The monthly series (MCUMFN; not graphed) reaches and passes the start of the previous recovery in July of 2010. NBER <a href="http://www.nber.org/">official dates the end of the recession to June of 2009</a>, where Capacity Utilization reached its nadir of 65.2. It is perfectly reasonable to say &#8220;a recovery&#8221; began then, but a &#8220;Business Cycle&#8221; that ends with nearly 7% of usable capital (a 9.6% decline in capital terms) sitting vestigial is a poor &#8220;Cycle&#8221; indeed.</p>

<p><strong>The Tax Rate that Maximizes Economic Growth, Part 3… With Gov&#8217;t Spending, Money Supply and Demographics</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=29">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p>Today I will build a model that explains over three quarters of the annual movement in real GDP between 1929 and the present.  The model depends on marginal tax rates, government spending, the Fed, and demographic trends.  This post isn’t light reading and will demand a bit of attention, but I’m going to try to make it worth your while.  Let’s just say there’s a lot here that contradicts what you’ll read in your standard economics textbook.</p>
<p>This post continues the “Kimel curve” theme I’ve been following for the past few weeks, namely that there is a top that maximizes the growth of real GDP.  That is relatively easy to find: run a regression with growth in real GDP as the dependent variable, and the top marginal income tax rate and the top marginal income tax rate squared as explanatory variables.  (If you haven’t seen any posts in this series, or aren’t familiar with regression analysis, you might want to take a look <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=268">the first post in the series </a>.)  Official and relatively reliable data for GDP is available going back to 1929.  The growth maximizing top marginal tax rate according to that simple model is in the neighborhood of 65%.  </p>
<p>This week I’d like to add a few other variables that I think might affect growth.  The first is government spending; for a long time there has been a debate in this country about whether government spending can boost the economy. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Another variable I want to add is the Fed’s behavior.  If you’ve read <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/">Presimetrics</a>, the book I wrote with Michael Kanell, you know this is a variable I think has a huge effect on the economy, and not quite in the way textbooks tell you.  So I’m going to add two variables, both of which are dummies.  As I’ve noted in a couple posts, a dummy variable takes a value of one or zero, which also amounts to a “yes” or a “no.”  The first of these Fed behavior dummy variables tells us whether the real money supply increased a lot.  I’m defining that as a situation when the median 3 month change in real M1 throughout the year exceeded 1%.  (Real M1, obviously, being just M1 adjusted for inflation.)  The second Fed behavior dummy variable looks at whether there’s a big drop in the real money supply; that is, the variable is true when the median 3 month change in real M1 was a decrease of greater than 0.5%.   Why the asymmetry between big increases (over 1%) and big decreases (over 0.5%)?  Simple –the money supply should grow over time if only to keep up with population increases.</p>
<p>Moving on… the model contains two demographic variables.  One is the percentage of the population between 35 and 54 years of age.  That is to say, the proportion of people in more or less their prime earning years.  (I imagine prime earning years was closer to 35 in 1929, and has moved closer to 54 today as manual labor has become a less important piece of the economy.)  I’m also including the percentage of the population that is above 70 years of age; on average, most people in that demographic are not active in the work force.  </p>
<p>Finally, I’ve included one more dummy variable for the 1929 to 1932 period.  I’m not ready to explain that collapse yet, so I’ve included this variable if only to indicate that there is something different about those years than other years for which we have data.</p>
<p>So here’s what we get when we run a regression in Excel.  </p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSp8PGDqiFI/AAAAAAAAAgc/PN2u_imv4G4/s1600/Figure_11.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TSp8PGDqiFI/AAAAAAAAAgc/PN2u_imv4G4/s400/Figure_11.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>To interpret…  the adjusted R2 (light blue) tells us that the model explains about 76% of the variation in the growth in real GDP.  (If you’re interested – I did some residual analysis and the usual batch of things to be worried about come up with nothing.  E.g., the correlation between et and et+1 = 0.04.)  </p>
<p>Tax rates and tax rates squared are significant (green cells).  We get the same curve that has showed up in previous posts on this topic, but in this instance, the fastest real GDP growth occurs when the top marginal tax rate is 59%.  A bit lower than the 65% figure from earlier models, but close enough… and pretty far away from what most economists and politicians and talk show hosts will tell you.  Like it’s a surprise such folks are wrong.</p>
<p>And on the topic of those folks being wrong… government spending is significant, contributes to growth, and does so at an increasingly faster rate as government spending increases.  (Burnt orange.)  On the other hand, it doesn’t necessarily pay for itself.  In future posts I’d like to split out government spending, as I have a feeling different forms of government spending have different effects.  </p>
<p>What about the Fed?  Well, it turns out the economy grows faster when the Fed increases the money supply quickly, and grows more slowly when the Fed decreases the money supply.  Not a surprise if you read my book, but…  you may recall your econ courses that taught you the Fed is supposed to try to boost the economy when it is in the doldrums, and slow the economy when its growing too quickly.  If the Fed really behaved that way, big increases in real M1 would be accompanied by slow economic growth, and big decreases in real M1 would be accompanied by fast economic growth.  This is yet another indication of something I’ve pointed out many times before – historically, either the folks on the Fed’s board don’t know what they’re doing, or they’re doing something different than most economists believe they’re doing.  Since they’re political appointees, I’d bet on both.  </p>
<p>1929 – 1932 is negative and significant.  No surprise.</p>
<p>Demographics – the prime earning demographic is positive and significant.  The more people in that demographic, the faster the economy grows.  No surprise, but a big negative – that demographic hit a peak in 2001.  It drifted down very slowly since, but its not going up any more.  The elderly contingent, on the other hand, is not significant.  </p>
<p>OK.  So…  the idea that if we want to maximize economic growth, the top marginal rate is somewhere well north of what most people believe seems to survive over a number of different posts.  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=261">Here&#8217;s one reason why.</a>  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=256">Here&#8217;s another.</a>  I’ll have a few more posts on the topic – this little exercise keeps raising more and more questions in my mind.</p>
<p>But a question – are these posts getting too complicated for a blog?  More graphs?  Comments?</p>

<p>Top individual marginal income tax rates from the IRS’ Statistics of Income <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175910,00.html">historical table 23</a></p>
<p>M1 comes from a number of different sources.  M1 from prior to 1947 is available biannually (June and December) from documents in the FRASER collection of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  Specifically, data from prior to 1946 came from <a href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publications/bms/page/282/61/download/282.pdf">here</a>, and data from 1941 to 1947 came from <a href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publications/bms2/issue/60/download/102/section1.pdf">here</a>.  The data was “monthleycized” using a simple linear transformation.  FRASER also contains monthly data from 1947 to 1958 <a href="http://fraser.stlouisfed.org/publications/bms2/issue/60/download/102/section1.pdf">in this document </a>.  Finally, another St. Louis Fed database, FRED, contains <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/M1NS">monthly M1 from 1959 to the present</a>.  </p>
<p>Inflation adjustments were computed using monthly and yearly <a href="ftp://ftp.bls.gov/pub/special.requests/cpi/cpiai.txt">CPI-U</a> figures from the BLS.</p>
<p>Population figures were obtained (and organized painstakingly) from various Census sources:  <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/pre-1980/PE-11.html">pre-1980s</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/1980s/">1980s</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/1990s/">1990s</a>, and <a href="http://www.census.gov/popest/archives/2000s/">2000s</a>.  (I’m certain there was an easier way…)</p>
<p>As always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.  Drop me a line at my first name, period my last name, at gmail period com.  And note my first name in the e-mail address is mike.  An “m” gets you someone else whose patience is starting wear thin.  Also, on the subject of “m”s – my last name has only one.  Because a lot of people have been asking for my spreadsheets as of late, to make things easier please tell me the the name of this post, the date it appeared, and where it appeared.  </p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
