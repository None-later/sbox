<blockquote>How Insurers May Use “Wellness Programs” To Target Pre-Existing Conditions</p></blockquote>
<p></a></p>
<p>Under reform, insurers will still do their best to shun the sick&#8230;one way they may do it: by using “wellness programs” to penalize those who can’t meet health targets&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;A little-discussed provision of the Senate bill allows insurers to expand so-called wellness programs that let insurers  penalize subscribers by hundreds—and even thousands—of dollars for not meeting certain ‘wellness targets,’ such as a particular cholesterol number, blood sugar measurement or body-weight target.</p>
<p>&#8230;one of the pro-business innovations of the Bush administration was to introduce into health insurance regulations a provision allowing employers to offer loosely defined &#8220;wellness&#8221; programs that carry incentives for employees meeting certain standards of premium reductions of as much as 20 percent. Sounds like a pretty good deal, right? Sure, until you realize that there&#8217;s no baseline for the original premium, meaning that, in reality, people who don&#8217;t meet the standards are really carrying the burden of others&#8217; discounts and then some—paying as much as 20 percent more for a policy in which a family member&#8217;s failure to meet a wellness target forces up the entire premium for that family&#8217;s policy&#8230;</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>&#8230;while insurers may no longer be able to drop your coverage for a preexisting condition such as high blood pressure, under the Senate bill they will be able to charge you and your employer as much as 50 percent more for your total premium cost if you fail to meet a targeted blood pressure or cholesterol measurement.</p>
<p>For instance, there is the widespread problem of obesity.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Obesity doesn’t seem like a subtle disease,” adds Dr. Lee Kaplan, who heads the Weight Reduction Program at Mass General Hospital. “But it is. If something is off kilter by just 1 percent in your system that can lead to a 100 pound weight gain. More than 400 genes are involved in weight regulation. And that doesn’t include the environmental factors.”</p>
<p>&#8230;Dr. Michael Rosenbaum, a Columbia University researcher working on an NIH-funded study on weight control [points out that] “Obesity is the one disease where your body fights the cure.”</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Under the wellness programs Stan [at AlterNet] describes, employees suffering from such a flaw in body chemistry would be punished.                     </p>
<p>[T]he American Heart Association does not object to employer-sponsored wellness programs per se, but only to financial penalties imposed on those who don’t participate in “voluntary” wellness programs or cannot meet wellness targets. As the AHA points out;  “the causes of obesity, hypertension, and high cholesterol are many, and vary between individuals.” For instance, genetic predisposition is an important factor in many conditions. Therefore, penalizing individuals for their risk factors sometimes means penalizing them for their genetic makeup which is beyond their control.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Moreover,  the AHA points out, “Even health factors that are theoretically controllable in the best of circumstances may be vastly more difficult to control for those who are: (1) low income; (2) working more than one job; (3) working parents; (4) dealing with chronic mental or physical conditions; or (5) caring for sick parents, children or other family members.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>Stan concludes that what is most troubling is how the penalties zero in on “people least likely to be able to control the circumstances that lead to their inability to meet wellness targets—the poor and those with genetic predispositions to certain conditions &#8230; So, unless regulators intervene, insurers will continue to discriminate against those who most need high quality, affordable care. </p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Back on July 28th I posted on what I considered to be the most important provision of the original House Tri-Committee Health Care Bill in <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/07/hr3200-sec-116-golden-bullet-or-smoking.html">Sec 116: Golden Bullet or Smoking Gun</a> Smoking Gun referred to the belief by Republicans that this bill was designed to ultimately transition to Single Payer, and Golden Bullet to my belief that they were right, that if you forced private insurance to give up its predatory business model that ultimately they would abandon less profitable markets just as they did in the heyday of managed care.</p>
<p> What Sec 116 did was to establish minimum Medical Loss Ratios for all plans participating in the proposed Exchanges. Medical Loss Ratio is the industry term for percentage of premium dollar actually spent on provider payments with the remainder retained by the company to pay for marketing, administration, executive compensation, and profit. Under the House Bill the actual mandated MLR for each area would be set by an auction process and in that model you pretty much needed a Public Option to establish a baseline.</p>
<p>Over the course of the summer and fall the language of Sec 116 was displaced and minimized in a way that restricted it only to policies issued before the establishment of the Exchanges and so make it almost useless in the bigger picture. But then a near miracle happened at the last minute, the Team of Ten inserted Section 2718 &#8220;BRINGING DOWN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE <br />COVERAGE&#8221;. MLR Regulation was back, and better the ever. Text from the Manager&#8217;s Amendment and commentary below.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>‘‘(b) ENSURING THAT CONSUMERS RECEIVE VALUE FOR THEIR PREMIUM PAYMENTS.— <br />‘‘(1) REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE VALUE FOR PREMIUM PAYMENTS.— <br />‘‘(A) REQUIREMENT.—Beginning not later than January 1, 2011, a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage (including a grandfathered health plan) shall, with respect to each plan year, provide an annual rebate to each enrollee under such coverage, on a pro rata basis, if the ratio of the amount of premium revenue expended by the issuer on costs described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) to the total amount of premium revenue (excluding Federal and State taxes and licensing or regulatory fees and after accounting for payments or receipts for risk adjustment, risk corridors, and reinsurance under sections 1341, 1342, and 1343 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) for the plan year (except as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii)), is less than—  <br />‘‘(i) with respect to a health insurance issuer offering coverage in the large group market, 85 percent, or such higher percentage as a State may by regulation determine; or  <br />‘‘(ii) with respect to a health insurance issuer offering coverage in the small group market or in the individual market, 80 percent, or such higher percentage as a State may by regulation determine, except that the Secretary may adjust such percentage with respect to a State if the Secretary determines that the application of such 80 percent may destabilize the individual market in such State. </p></blockquote>
<p> The language is convulted but the result is simple, insurance companies can no longer make money by ensuring people who don&#8217;t make claims.</p>
<p>Under the current business model of private insurers the goal is to recruit insurees who in all likelhood won&#8217;t make claims, while denying those who are certain to either because of pre-existing conditions or simply by falling sick. The bill directly outlaws those practices but under 2718 they wouldn&#8217;t have the desired effect anyway. Take the hypothetical case where your entire risk pool is made up of healthy young adults whose claims are mostly limited to broken bones from skiing or biking accidents. Under 2718 unless those claims across the risk pool don&#8217;t add up to 80% or 85% depending the insurer has to rebate the extra premium. At the extreme the company would have to rebate the entire premium and so go out of business having no revenue to even pay employees. Under the new model the only ways to increase profits are one, to compete on the basis of volume, or two to reduce administrative costs, which is a 180 from the current model of hastling claimants into dropping coverage or simply finding excuses to rescind coverage.</p>
<p>Similarly 2718 limits or eliminates the utility of simply raising premiums because it would require a parallel increase of provider payments on an 85 to 15 ratio, otherwise the rebate provision would trigger. And while collusion between provider and insurer can&#8217;t be excluded the benefits would  flow more than 5 to 1 to the provider while the price differential with other plans falls entirely on the insurer. The same effect occurs by eliminating a category of coverage, even if you didn&#8217;t fall afoul of the Acceptable Benefits Package requirements once again you risk triggering the rebate provision.</p>
<p>The words are not used in the bill but the result is nearly automatic cost controls. And enforcement is relatively easy, most of the information needed to calculate MLR is readily available in SEC filings and IRS returns, you don&#8217;t need HHS auditors rummaging around in the records, the SEC, the FBI and the IRS are already on the job.</p>
<p>On some other blogs I called this &#8220;The Most Important Health Care Provision You Never Heard Of&#8221;, something that is no longer true. It was reported the other day that the Health Care insurers were ecstatic at the passage of the bill, all those new customers delivered by the individual mandate! And Wall Street responded. But then some lobbyist realized what the real import of 2718 was and sent a follow up memo saying &#8220;not so fast&#8221;.</p>
<p>This language is not in the House Bill, at least not with the same effect, and we can expect that insurance companies will start working on the usual suspects to kill the bill on final. Which in my mind is reason to just get this bill signed to nail 2718 into law. Because on its own it has many of the same benefits on the overall system that the Public Option was supposed to deliver.</p>

<p>What Has Been Accomplished; What Still Must Be Done</p>
<p>These days, many progressives are expressing deep disappointment with the health reform legislation now moving through Congress. Some suggest that some legislators made deals with lobbyists and let them write the bills. Others complain that both the subsidies and the penalties are too low. Still others don’t like the fact that states can “opt out” of the public insurance option, and decide not to offer Medicare E. Finally, many ask:<br />Why can’t everyone sign on for the public plan in 2013? Why do we have to wait until 2013? Why cn’t they roll out universal coverage next year?”</p>
<p>Normally, I would be among the first to critique the bills. By temperament and training, I’m both a skeptic and a critic. <br />But in this case, I think it is important to recognize that we cannot expect this first piece of health reform legislation to be anything but wildly imperfect. In fact, I’m impressed by the progress Washington has made in just ten months. I’ve been watching the struggle for health care reform since the early 1970s, and compared to what has happened over the past 39 years, this is mind -boggling. </p>
<p>I also believe that those who favor overhauling our health care system should send a strong signal to legislators: we support you for having come this far. We realize that you have three years to strengthen, change and refine the plan before rolling it out in 2013.</p>
<p>What Has Been Accomplished </p>
<p>What is astounding is that this Congress has made as much progress as it has. We may have a new administration in the White House, but we do not have a brand-new group on the Hill. The majority of our legislators are moderates; many are conservatives. Nevertheless, a sufficient number have found the will to stand up and back changes that would make health care affordable for millions of poor, working-class and middle-class Americans.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />For example, under the House bill,<a href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29046.html" target="_blank">a family of three making $32,000</a> a year would pay just $1,360 in annual premiums for good, comprehensive coverage; under the Senate Finance Committee bill, the same family would be asked to lay out only $2,013. Today, without reform, if that family tried to buy insurance, it would find that the average plan costs $13,500. For this household, the current legislation makes all of the difference.</p>
<p>Too often, the press suggests that such a family would be expected to pay $10,000 out-of-pocket to cover co-pays and deductibles. That just isn’t true. Even if the entire family were in an auto accident and racked up $200,000 in medical bills, at their income level, the House bill caps out-of-pocket expenses at $2,000 a year. Under the Senate Finance bill, the family would have to pay $4,000. Moreover, under both bills, there are no co-pays for primary care. Even private insurers cannot put a $25 dollar barrier between a family and preventive care. </p>
<p>Moving up the income ladder, a median-income household earning roughly $55,000 would pay premiums of $4,300 to $6,500—depending on whether the Senate Finance bill or the more generous House bill sets the terms. Without legislation, they too would face a $13,500 price tag &#8211;and that is if they could get a group rate. If they are buying insurance on their own, coverage could easily cost $16,000.</p>
<p>For self-employed workers, early retirees, and those who work for (or own) a small business; the legislation offers major savings. They will be able to buy coverage on the Insurance Exchange, where they would suddenly become part of a group—which makes their premiums much lower. Whether rich or poor, this is great news for anyone who works for himself, retired early (voluntarily or involuntarily), or is part of a small firm.</p>
<p>Granted, the legislation now on the table still doesn’t make insurance affordable for many Americans at the upper-edges of the middle-class–-or the upper-middle-class. They don’t qualify for subsidies. But, as I discuss below, the legislation does point the way to lowering their premiums. Before reform becomes a reality in 2013, I am convinced that this will happen, in part because it must. We can no longer ignore the waste, inefficiency and pure fraud in our health care system. There is absolutely no reason why we should pay so much more for health care than any other nation in the developed world.</p>
<p>And at least the current legislation protects these more affluent households from medical bankruptcy. No matter how much a family earns, they cannot be asked to pay more than $10,000, out of pocket, in a given year. For households that have savings and property to protect, this means that they don’t have to worry about being wiped out by a medical disaster. Even if you and your family are in that car accident that leads to $200,000 in doctors’ and hospitals bills, you will owe only $10,000. In that situation, doctors and hospitals will let you pay off your bills over time, because they know you can. You won’t be forced into bankruptcy court. This represents an enormous step forward.</p>
<p>In addition, under reform, private insurers will not be able to put a cap on how much they will pay out to you and your family, over the course of a year, or over a lifetime. If tragedy strikes and a child needs six or seven years of cancer treatments, your insurance will not “run out.” For some families, this one provision will mean the difference between being able to care for their child and financial ruin (coupled with the suspicion that, if they had just had more coverage, they might have been able to save their child.)</p>
<p>Moreover, in the very first year of reform, the public plan will offer less expensive, higher quality coverage to millions of Americans. Congressional Budget Office director Douglas Elmendorf disagrees. He has been spreading misinformation about the government plan. First he low-balls the number of Americans who will be eligible for the Insurance Exchange where they can choose between a public plan and private insurance. . He then asserts that only 20 percent of Exchange shoppers will choose the government plan while 80 percent will pick private insurance. Here Elmendorf pretends that he can read minds:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Elmendorf goes on to argue that despite the fact that its administrative costs will be far lower, the public plan will cost more than comprehensive private insurance. This theory is based on the unfounded assumption that very few people will select the public plan , coupled with speculation that the public plan will make no effort to control costs and utilization. This makes no sense; as reform legislation makes clear, part of the purpose of the public plan is to offer higher quality care for less. (In part two of his post, I will examine Elmendorf&#8217;s guesstimates in detail.)”</p></blockquote>
<p>For peculiar reasons that I don’t fully understand, progressives have been listening to Elmendorf’s numbers. They seem to forget his past: a student of the Dean of Conservative Economists. Elmendorf first made his mark in Washington by helping to quash the Clinton’s hopes for health care reform. <br />Finally, under the House and Senate reform bills, insurers will no longer be able to deny coverage, or charge a customer more, because of a pre-existing condition. If you have begun to take that idea for granted, keep in mind the Republican’s recent 11th hour proposal for reform “gives the insurance industry more leeway” as the Wall Street Journal put it yesterday (<a href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/200911030011" target="_blank">Media Matters for America blog</a> points out the disappearance of WSJ story; “GOP Health Bill Gives Insurers More Leeway” from the paper’s website sometime last night.) Under the Republican proposal, insurers would be able to take pre-existing conditions into consideration.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s “Fact Sheet” offers two examples illustrating just how easy it is for insurers to deny coverage today:</p>
<blockquote><p>Peggy Robertson: A Colorado mother of two who was denied health coverage because she had a c-section in 2006. The insurance company told her if she got “sterilized” she would be eligible for coverage.</p>
<p>Christina Turner: After being sexually assaulted in Florida, Christina Turner followed her doctor’s orders and took a month’s worth of anti-AIDS medication as a precautionary measure. She never developed an HIV infection. Months later, when shopping for new health insurance coverage, Ms. Turner was repeatedly denied coverage because of the precautionary treatment she received after being raped.</p></blockquote>
<p>In most states today, this could happen to anyone. I live in New York where we have community ratings and I don’t have to worry about pre-existing conditions. My employer provides excellent insurance, with no annual or lifetime caps, so the current reform legislation would probably have no immediate effect on my life. But, we all should recognize that the bills on the table would change the lives of millions of Americans, giving them the security that they don’t have today.</p>
<p>Progressives cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers because we are so busy critiquing the legislation&#8211;and arguing with each other. <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125727378900825913.html" target="_blank">Online WS Journal</a> reports that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has begun to warn that the Senate may not be able to complete the legislation by the end of this year.</p>
<p>Given all of the criticism he has faced, Reid could be losing heart. After all, Conservatives continue to argue that legislators like Reid will be punished at the polls. Congressmen who have been pushing for reform need our encouragement. Progressives should continue to make it clear that the majority of Americans want reform&#8211; and a public option&#8211; even if the legislation is far from perfect.</p>
<p>2010 is an election year. Fearful of losing, some Congressmen will begin to back away from change making it critical that broad reform legislation is passed this year. Over the next three years, it can be amended as the critical details are fleshed out. Anyone who thought that Congress would be able to overhaul a $2.6 trillion dollar industry with just one bill was, I submit, terribly naïve.</p>
<p>What Remains To Be Done In the Next Three Years </p>
<p>There is so much to be done and this is one reason why reform cannot be implemented until 2013:<br />&#8211; Congress must figure out how to regulate the private insurance industry. This will require enormous cunning. <br />&#8211; Reformers will have to find a way to stiffen the penalties for those who choose not to buy insurance, without alienating young, healthy voters. This is a job for a charismatic president. <br />&#8211; Legislators must map out how the Insurance Exchange will work. <br />&#8211; They also will need to come up with a formula that will adjust for risk if one plan winds up with a larger share of poor and sick customers. (Some fear that this will happen to the Public Plan, so this, too, is a crucial detail.) <br />&#8211; Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Medicare needs time to begin eliminating waste in the system—saving billions of health care dollars while simultaneously lifting the quality of care. In fact, while all eyes are focused on the legislation, Medicare already has begun putting its own house in order. </p>
<p>What many reformers don’t seem to understand is when the public plan begins to negotiate fees with providers in 2013, Medicare fees for some very expensive services will be significantly lower than they are today, while reimbursements to primary care doctors will be higher.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Medicare already has announced plans to cut fees for CT scans and MRIs next year, and has proposed trimming fees to cardiologist by 6 percent . Meanwhile, it would hike fees for primary care physicians by 4 percent. Congress has just 60 days to respond to the changes in reimbursements to doctors or they will automatically take effect January 1. Over the next three years, we can expect more changes in the fee schedule. And private insurers will follow Medicare’s lead.” </p></blockquote>
<p>As they have explained to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC), they just want Medicare to provide political cover. In other words, in 2013 the public plan will be negotiating fees with providers in a very different, less expensive, and more rational context. <br />This is another reason why public plan premiums will be significantly lower than Congressional Budget Office (CBO) director Douglas Elmendorf suggests.</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the next three years, Medicare will be realigning financial incentives to reward preventive care and management of chronic diseases, while reducing payments for overly aggressive tests and treatments that have no proven benefit&#8211; and penalizing hospitals that don’t pay enough attention to medical errors. In the process, Medicare will be conserving health care dollars while protecting patients from needless risks. As President Obama has promised, Medicare cuts can make healthcare safer and more affordable for everyone—including the upper-middle class. Because most private insurers will mime Medicare’s efforts to reduce overpayment, the cost of care will come down for everyone.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Public Plan will incorporate Medicare’s reforms and it will have clout. Seven percent of Americans purchase their own insurance in the private sector market. Most of the seven percent are neither poor nor sick. If they were, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to buy insurance in the individual market.)( More than half of this group earn over $55,000. They will be able to go into the Exchange and sign up for the public plan. In addition, a large share of relatively young Americans (ages 25-34) are uninsured and relatively healthy. No one knows how many will choose the public plan; but since it will have much lower administrative costs than private sector plans, it will be less expensive and more attractive to younger Americans.</p>
<p>States will not opt out. It would be too difficult for politicians to try to explain to voters why they cannot have access to a government plan that will be able to offer comprehensive insurance for less.</p>
<p>In part 2 of this post, I will explain what Medicare is already doing to pave the way for a structural overhaul of our health care system, and why none of these cost-saving reforms need to be –or should be&#8211;spelled out in reform legislation.</p>

<p>Not only is ER care enormously expensive for &#8216;more routine&#8217; health concerns than a clinic, but perhaps are not equal for insure/uninsured even for traffic accidents, not withstanding our best wishes.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sphere.com/2009/11/16/trauma-victims-face-far-worse-odds-when-uninsured-study-says/" target="_blank">Sphere</a> notes a report from the <a href="http://archsurg.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/short/144/11/1006?home" target="_blank"><i>Archives of Surgery</i></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s federal law: All seriously injured emergency and trauma patients must be given equal lifesaving care, whether or not they can pay for it. But that&#8217;s not happening, according to a new report. The study, conducted by Children&#8217;s Hospital Boston research fellow Dr. Heather Rosen and colleagues from three other hospitals, found that uninsured trauma victims ages 18 to 30 are dying at an annual rate 89 percent higher than insured victims with identically severe injuries. </p>
<p>As the health reform tornado continues to swirl on Capitol Hill, the data could provide fresh ammunition for those pushing for expanded health insurance coverage. </p>
<p>The study, published today in the Archives of Surgery, examines the survival rates for patients brought to about 900 U.S. trauma centers between 2002 and 2006, analyzing some 690,000 patients who had suffered penetrating trauma &#8212; such as wounds inflicted by a gun or knife &#8212; or blunt trauma from vehicle crashes and falls. Earlier research found 18,000 extra deaths a year among uninsured victims of such injuries. Rosen and the other researchers chose to focus on the 18-to-30-year-old subset because they had fewer existing conditions &#8212; comorbidity &#8212; that muddy the evaluation of the cause of death.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>In a comment published with the journal article, Dr. Brent Eastman, a trauma and vascular surgeon from Scripps Memorial Hospital in San Diego who was just elected chairman of the Board of Regents of the American College of Surgeons, noted that emergency rooms and trauma centers &#8220;are the safety net for many communities.&#8221; He called for Rosen&#8217;s conclusions to be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Rosen cautions that the definitive cause for the higher death rate for uninsured people remains to be determined. Still, the hard number &#8212; the nearly 90 percent jump in mortality rates for uninsured accident victims &#8212; speaks loudly on its own. &#8220;Although the lack of insurance may not be the only explanation,&#8221; she says, &#8220;the accidental costs of being uninsured in the United States today may be too high to continue to overlook.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/27/health/policy/27insure.html?_r=1">NYT</a> reports on $40,000/year health plans as we discuss health payment options for health care.</p>
<blockquote><p>Goldman Sachs is one of the nation’s richest banks, and hundreds of top Goldman employees have a health care package to match — one of the “gold-plated Cadillac” plans cited by those involved in the health care debate in Washington. </p>
<p>Reach of Subsidies Is Critical Issue for Health Plan (July 27, 2009) Goldman’s 400 or so managing directors and its top executive officers participate in the bank’s executive medical and dental program as part of their benefits, according to documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The program generally costs the bank $40,543 in premiums annually for each participant’s family.</p>
<p>Those taking part in the plan include the company’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, and four other top officers, as well as managing directors, whose base salary is $600,000. </p>
<p>Goldman’s medical coverage entered the health care discussion on Sunday when David Axelrod, senior adviser to President Obama, cited the Goldman program as an example of the expensive benefits the administration might consider taxing to help pay for its health care program. </p>
<p>“The president actually was asked this the other day by Jim Lehrer, and what he said was that this was an intriguing idea to put an excise tax on high-end health care policies like the ones that the executives at Goldman Sachs have, the $40,000 policies,” Mr. Axelrod said. </p>
<p>Goldman did not return messages on Sunday to comment about Mr. Axelrod’s comments. </p>
<p>A proposal by Senator John F. Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, would impose an excise tax on the insurers that issue policies like Goldman’s, with the expectation that the insurers would pass along most, if not all, of the cost to employers who buy the plans.</p>
<p>Leaders of the Senate Finance Committee, which is working on bipartisan version of the health care legislation in Congress, had long expressed interest in taxing some employer-provided benefits — a move many budget experts say would help slow the steep rise in health costs. </p>
<p>A number of Democrats opposed the plan, so negotiators began looking for other ways to cover the roughly $1 trillion, 10-year cost of the bill. </p>
<p>Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and an author of the Finance Committee’s health bill, endorsed taxing rich plans during an appearance Sunday on “This Week With George Stephanopoulos” on ABC.</p>
<p>Asked if Congress would tax high-end plans, Mr. Conrad said: “I think we’ve got to. Again, virtually every economist that’s come before us has said you’ve got to reduce that tax subsidy as part of an overall strategy to really contain costs.” </p>
<p>An aide to Republicans involved in the Finance Committee negotiations said the idea was “on the table in discussions as a serious effort by Senator Kerry to restart the conversation on bending down the cost curve.” Aides to Senator Max Baucus confirmed that he, too, was considering the proposal, and House leaders said they were as well. </p>
<p>Negotiators have not yet determined the value of the plans that would set off a tax on the insurance companies; the numbers under discussion range from $20,000 to $40,000 annually, a senior administration official said.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this debate on how to finance health care, we are hearing about the costs to deliver health care and how to bring them down.   <a href="http://www.boston.com/yourtown/wellesley/articles/2009/07/17/pay_for_care_a_new_way_state_is_urged/">Mass is now proposing</a> a capitated payment system that will be government created.  It is the latest fix to a herald &#8220;fixed&#8221; problem.  Which begs the question, why do they need to fix it again, yet, still?</p>
<blockquote><p>The 10-member commission&#8230; voted unanimously to largely scrap the current system, in which insurers typically pay doctors and hospitals a negotiated fee for each individual procedure or visit. That arrangement is widely seen as leading to unneeded tests and procedures.<br />A state commission recommended yesterday that Massachusetts dramatically change how doctors and hospitals are paid&#8230;the group wants private insurers and the state and federal Medicaid program to pay providers a set payment for each patient that covers all that person’s care for an entire year and to make the radical shift within five years. Providers would have to work within a predetermined budget, forcing them to better coordinate patients’ care, which could improve quality and reduce costs.<br />The plan would require significant restructuring of the healthcare system, and some of its components would need legislative approval. Primary-care doctors, specialists, hospitals, and home healthcare agencies would have to form so-called accountable care organizations. Patients would choose a primary care doctor to coordinate their care, mostly within the organization. Insurers would pay the accountable care organization a flat yearly per-patient fee to be divided among the providers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the above again: <em>recommended&#8230;that Massachusetts dramatically change&#8230; to make the radical shift&#8230; The plan would require significant restructuring of the healthcare system, and some of its components would need legislative approval&#8230; to form so-called accountable care organizations.</em> </p>
<p><a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/06/deja-vu-health-care-reform-hillary-care.html">Deja vu? </a> </p>
<p>Dramatically?  Radical?  Significant?  Legislative approval?  An entirely new thingy called &#8220;accountable care organizations?  What?  IPA, HMO, PPO, POS, EPO, Self Directed, HSA, Capitated, IME, Primary Care, Fee-for-service, PCP, CAM, and for Massachusetts specifically; <a href="http://www.mahealthconnector.org/portal/site/connector/">Commonwealth Connector</a> just didn&#8217;t do it for you.  We need more?  &#8220;Doctor&#8221;, &#8220;insurer&#8221;, &#8220;patient&#8221;, &#8220;government&#8221; were not enough?    </p>
<p>I want to know,  just how much in administration cost will this new fix add?  Is this the old promise of managed care, that the savings will accumulate enough to pay for the cost of administration plus a profit?  Hasn&#8217;t worked yet.   </p>
<p>It may work I guess, if we just add enough superlatives in our sentences while we present the new and improved Model T.  Or maybe not.  From the journal, Medical Care:<a href="http://journals.lww.com/lww-medicalcare/Abstract/2003/02000/Managed_Health_Plan_Effects_on_the_Specialty.6.aspx"> Managed Health Plan Effects </a>on the Specialty Referral Process: <br />
<blockquote>Results. <strong>The percentages of office visits resulting in a referral were </strong>similar between the two gatekeeping groups and <strong>higher than the no gatekeeping group</strong>. Patients in plans with capitated PCP payment were more likely to be referred for discretionary indications than those in nongatekeeping plans (15.5% v 9.9%, P The frequency of referring physician coordination activities did not vary by health plan type. The proportion of patients in gatekeeping health plans within a practice was directly related to employing staff as referral coordinators, allowing nurses to refer without physician consultation, and permitting patients to request referrals by leaving recorded telephone messages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Massachusetts states: <em>That arrangement is widely seen as leading to unneeded tests and procedures.</em>  They were referring to the method of paying a doctor. Yet the study shows that the referral patterns don&#8217;t change with changing the method of payment.  Well, does Massachusetts think the unneeded tests and procedures are happening without referrals?</p>
<p>Pick the approach, it didn&#8217;t change the referral pattern and, systems were set up by those being managed to make the referral process more efficient.  So, either the patients need the referral  (thus tests and procedures) and none of these money managing approaches are going to ultimately stop it, or the PCP finds a way to keep the traffic moving through the office because the more patients served the more money collected.  (Deja vu)  It&#8217;s a solution to a head-count/ piece-work payment system that still does not get the doc to do the job of applying the knowledge of health and healing to a given person&#8217;s presentation.  (I&#8217;m accepting bets on how long it will be before we hear about the next fixing of the latest fixed Mass health care system.  Post your bet in comments.)</p>
<p>This gets us to the one area that has been rolled out many times, but is often excused off as not being reliable as to achieving real savings and thus why we really don&#8217;t want a government funded single payer solution (other than our pride of not thinking of it first):  Administration costs.  It is the old medicare is cheaper than private insurance because of administration cost argument.  </p>
<p>We&#8217;re hearing of the new plan being modeled on the Massachusetts system.  It&#8217;s not working as noted by the need to fix it again (though past experience with other states showed it would not work).  The fix is more administration costs on top of more administration costs.  If they keep going this way, soon a medicare modeled administration system&#8217;s costs will be comparable to the private insurer, thus defeating the need to fix health care. So lets just accept that health care costs a lot to administrate, stop wasting time trying to reduce the cost and let the private system stay?</p>
<p>NOT!</p>
<p>From this article: <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/publications/nejmadmin.pdf">Costs of Health Care Administration </a>in the United States and Canada, NEJM 2003, we learn that administrative costs have been rising faster in the US than in Canada. <br />
<blockquote>We investigated whether the ascendancy of computerization, managed care, and the adoption of more businesslike approaches to health care have decreased administrative costs.</p>
<p>For the United States and Canada, we calculated the administrative costs of health insurers, employers’ health benefit programs, hospitals, practitioners’ offices, nursing homes, and home care agencies in 1999. </p>
<p>In 1999, health administration costs totaled at least $294.3 billion in the United States, or $1,059 per capita, as compared with $307 per capita in Canada. After exclusions, administration accounted for 31.0 percent of health care expenditures in the United States and 16.7 percent of health care expenditures in Canada. Canada’s national health insurance program had overhead of 1.3 percent; the overhead among Canada’s private insurers was higher than that in the United States (13.2 percent vs. 11.7 percent). Providers’ administrative costs were far lower in Canada.</p>
<p>Between 1969 and 1999, the share of the U.S. health care labor force accounted for by administrative workers grew from 18.2 percent to 27.3 percent. In Canada, it grew from 16.0 percent in 1971 to 19.1 percent in 1996. (Both nations’ figures exclude insurance-industry personnel.)</p></blockquote>
<p> You know, I think maybe administration has become a growth industry for the health insurance industry?  Was this part of the plan to shift us to a service economy? <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcnPZeVMI/AAAAAAAAANw/5u0eJeg-x-s/s1600-h/Health+Care+Admin+cost+chart.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcnPZeVMI/AAAAAAAAANw/5u0eJeg-x-s/s400/Health+Care+Admin+cost+chart.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcbWTSVjI/AAAAAAAAANo/ueYsLMAamVM/s1600-h/Admin+%26+Clerical+Personnel+Labor+Force+chart.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcbWTSVjI/AAAAAAAAANo/ueYsLMAamVM/s400/Admin+%26+Clerical+Personnel+Labor+Force+chart.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a> <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcMpFFyBI/AAAAAAAAANg/L61tTSaJfB0/s1600-h/Enrollee+vs+Employees+of+Ins+vs+Canada.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SmYcMpFFyBI/AAAAAAAAANg/L61tTSaJfB0/s400/Enrollee+vs+Employees+of+Ins+vs+Canada.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Understand what the authors are saying here.  It&#8217;s not just administrative costs related to the job of getting the patient&#8217;s dollar to the provider (medicare vs private), it&#8217;s the overall costs to the entire health care system as a results of the &#8220;administrative&#8221; systems the private insurance industry has put in place to &#8220;save us money&#8221;.  No one is immune from paying these costs.  They are part of the premiums charged, fees withheld, claims refiled, etc.  All this administrative labor to control the costs, and yet the cost of health care keeps rising.  Well, if the insurance employees can&#8217;t stop the rising costs, then what are we paying them for?</p>
<p>This is starting to make me think that Bruce Webb&#8217;s &#8220;do nothing plan&#8221; for Social Security should be applied to fixing health care.   In this case the &#8220;do nothing&#8221; plan would be to get rid of the paper chase and achieve real savings.  That is, do nothing regarding active management of health care costs via administrative systems.  Don&#8217;t try to manage the doc&#8217;s, just let them do what they do and save money by eliminating all the systems that try to manage them.  Though, there is a way to manage the doc&#8217;s that would not cost us in administration: competition among provider types.  Let the various algorithms of applying the knowledge of health and healing compete.  Thus, <a href="http://www.jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(07)00076-0/abstract">research such as this</a> needs to be considered regardless of one&#8217;s opinion of the group studied.<br />
<blockquote>Clinical and cost utilization based on 70274 member-months over a 7-year period demonstrated decreases of 60.2% in-hospital admissions, 59.0% hospital days, 62.0% outpatient surgeries and procedures, and 85% pharmaceutical costs when compared with conventional medicine IPA performance for the same health maintenance organization product in the same geography and time frame.</p></blockquote>
<p> How about that, a reduction in &#8220;<em>unneeded test and procedures</em>&#8221; without adding administration costs.  Let the doc&#8217;s be but, use the clinical practice approach that actually cuts the &#8220;unneeded&#8221; because it is unneeded.  I think there is a lesson here?  Something along the lines of free market capitalism only the market is not the types of insurance competing for the patient, it&#8217;s the types of doctors that need to compete for the patient.</p>
<p>I got side tracked.  Lets stay with the one area for cost reductions: Administration.  The authors:<br />
<blockquote>Conclusions<br />The gap between U.S. and Canadian spending on health care administration has grown to $752 per capita. A large sum might be saved in the United States if administrative costs could be trimmed by implementing a Canadian-style health care system.</p>
<p>Despite these imprecisions, the difference in the costs of health care administration between the United States and Canada is clearly large and growing. <strong>Is $294.3 billion annually for U.S. health care administration money well spent</strong>?</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, is it?  Did they even ask?</p>

<p>Time for some real numbers.  This example is also an example for people to understand the need for fixing our system of paying for health care.  Because, even in the senior years, the cost can bankrupt you.</p>
<p>My parents, 2008 adjusted gross income $43,291.  $19,745 is capital gains from a one time sale of land.  This land was taken by the state of RI via eminent domain law.  See, Fidelity didn&#8217;t have enough land (300 acres via a low rent to the state in exchange for some jobs) if Dow Chemical was going to put a plant there.  Dow never built.   The land was worth around $400K on the open commercial market.  They got $180K divided by 3.  The land was in the family for centuries.</p>
<p>$15,502 in SS not taxed.</p>
<p>My step-father is in the nursing home.  Mom is currently paying the bill because they own the house.  It&#8217;s around $6500/m.  He&#8217;s on a few meds.  9 to be exact.  </p>
<p>The Plan: No deductible.  $2700 in total drug costs (co-pay plus plan pay) covered before the &#8220;coverage gap&#8221;.  </p>
<p>Total expense as of 4/30: $2804.20.  Coverage Gap: $4350.   Amount toward the Gap: $1098.06  Balance of TrOOP (true out of pocket): $3251.94.</p>
<p>After the &#8220;Coverage Gap&#8221; he enters Catastrophic Coverage.  The cost is $2.40/generic, $6/brand name.</p>
<p>So, he&#8217;s in the nursing home.  He might be able to get off of 1 maybe 2 of these if we can get him home.  Still, the cost of his meds have been running $370/m.  Now that he has entered the &#8220;Coverage Gap&#8221; the cost will be $700/m.  That is 4.6 months of paying before the rest of the insurance kicks in sometime in September 2009.  </p>
<p>$43,291 &#8211; $19,745 (cap gains) + 15,502 (SS) = $39,048 to live on.  <br />$39,048 &#8211; 4350 (Coverage Gap) = 34,698.00 to live on.   </p>
<p>Of course, some things have changed since the &#8220;crash&#8221;.  $8149 of that $34, 698 was dividends.  They cashed out this year.  So, that leaves $26,549 to live on.  We could have waited the crash out, but see, dad&#8217;s in a nursing home.  Either the home takes it, or the economy takes it. Either way, it&#8217;s not there to generate money from money.</p>
<p>$26,549 &#8211; $5989 (property tax) &#8211; $3922 (utilities) &#8211; $3038 (Insurance) &#8211; $5230 (auto expenses) = $8370 to live on.<br />Last year there was $8328 in medical expenses EXCLUDING meds.  I don&#8217;t expect that much this year, but there could be at least half that.  Mom needs some stents for the renal arteries before her vascular system pops from the very high Bp.</p>
<p>Total medical, out of pocket expenses, 2008: $9484.  Potential this year: $8,000 to12,000 approximately not including the nursing home costs.  That is $26,680 to date.  Even if he is home, there will be cost for home care help.</p>
<p>What does someone do who is not in their position?  Of course, if the medical is as last year, they will be in the hole financially.</p>

                                <p>Via Dr. Black, we <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/10/28/news/economy/health_care_and_election/?postversion=2008102807">get CNN reporting</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Younger, healthier workers likely wouldn&#8217;t abandon their company-sponsored plans, said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, McCain&#8217;s senior economic policy adviser.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would they leave?&#8221; said Holtz-Eakin. &#8220;What they are getting from their employer is way better than what they could get with the credit.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And why is it better?  Because of the tax credit that is going away.</p>
<p>But let&#8217;s be nice to a man who has, in the past few months, eliminated his credibility to ensure that no ex-GWBush Administration official retains his or her reputation after leaving office.*  Let&#8217;s assume he&#8217;s telling the truth.</p>
<p>So the young, healthy workers stay with the employer plan (that, miraculously, doesn&#8217;t go away in a miasma of Moral Hazard**).  This leaves the older workers, who no longer get a decent deal from their employer, to find something in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Gosh, guess what happens when your selection group becomes more Adverse? Costs go up.</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s review what Holtz-Eakin has actually declared, explicitly and by implication:
<ol>
<li>Younger workers will keep the employer-provided health insurance, since it would cost them more to buy on their own</li>
<li>Older workers won&#8217;t be provided with insurance, and it will cost them Even More than More to buy health insurance on their own.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even if we were ignoring that Health Insurance is <strong>NOT HEALTH <em>CARE</em></strong>,*** John McCain&#8217;s proposal, by the admission of his own Economic Advisor, makes the <em>current</em> situation appear <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_optimal">Pareto-optimal</a>.</p>
<p>Which leaves us only one question: Why would any economist <em>support</em> it?</p>
<p>*I should probably stipulate positive here.  For instance, anyone who followed Condi &#8220;I was National Security Advisor on 11 Sep 2001&#8221; Rice&#8217;s prior career wouldn&#8217;t have expected much from her.</p>
<p>**Using the actual Health Economics definition here, not the generic phrase to describe why we need to give Goldman Sachs and Jamie Dimon $700 Billion.</p>
<p>***Yes, I&#8217;m shouting.  Claiming to address health care when all you address is health insurance is like claiming to have fixed a smashed-in door by changing the lock on it.</p>

                                <p>The essence of &#8220;market-based&#8221; health care &#8220;reforms&#8221; is that patients are exposed to the prices of the services that they receive (or are offered) and choose not to consume those with low perceived net benefits.  With high-deductible health plans favored by conservative reformers, this means paying out of pocket for routine services. [*] This is a centerpiece of <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/19ba2f1c-c03f-4ac2-8cd5-5cf2edb527cf.htm">health care reform a la McCain</a>, in the mild camouflage of &#8220;innovative insurance&#8221; and &#8220;expand[ed] benefits of health savings accounts.&#8221;  [**] These plans already have been growing rapidly with a push from Bush and congressional Republican policies.</p>
<p>So how are they working out?  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/business/27701694.html?elr=KArksUUUU">In the S&#8217;trib&#8217;</a>, Chen May Yee finds that market magic does not always include putting enough dollars in those pockets:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Once a month, doctors and staff at Edina [Minnesota] Sports Health &#038; Wellness stay late to talk business&#8230;. Then there&#8217;s the topic nobody likes: which patients to drop because they aren&#8217;t paying their bills.</p>
<p>The clinic has been terminating an average of 16 patients a month. Most have high-deductible health plans and haven&#8217;t paid their bills for more than nine months&#8230;</p>
<p>Break-up letters from doctors are just one unintended consequence in the roll-out of high-deductible plans, the fastest-growing segment of the medical insurance market as traditional plans become ever more unaffordable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yee reports that the breakups happen in relatively special cases (e.g. small clinics that can&#8217;t afford to provide much uncompensated care) and information on the extent of the phenomenon is anecdotal.  However, larger organizations are seeing increases in uncompensated care provided to the theoretically-insured:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, [Hennepin County Medical Center] gave away $86 million in uncompensated care &#8212; $4 million, or 4.7 percent, to insured patients. This year, HCMC expects $90 million in uncompensated care, with 8.4 percent, or $7.5 million, from insured patients&#8230;</p>
<p>Fairview Health Services, Regions Hospital and HealthEast Care System also are seeing more unpaid bills from insured patients. Like HCMC, they&#8217;re nonprofit, with policies not to turn patients away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might suggest that a system is only so market-based when it relies on the public or (publicly-subsidized) nonprofit sectors to cover its failures.  And for an added bonus, the system is not necessarily cheaper to administer:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Medical billing offices are working harder than ever. What used to be paid by insurance in a couple of weeks is now being stretched out to two- to six-month payment plans for patients, said Randi Tapio, chief executive of Medical Billing Professionals in St. Cloud, a firm that works with independent physician offices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re sending statements every month, calling them,&#8221; Tapio said. &#8220;Our costs go up.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a patient is uninsured, a clinic can ask for payment upfront or devise an early payment plan. But with insured patients, health plans require that clinics wait until after the service and the health plan determines who owes what. By then, the patient is out the door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But never fear, improved bill-collection technology is here!</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, [a] clinic began asking patients having costly procedures such as surgeries to swipe a credit card upfront. An estimated amount is authorized but not charged until the health plan sends a letter saying what the patient owes&#8230;</p>
<p>HealthEast clinics are looking into check-in kiosks, like those at airports, where patients insert a credit card and are asked if they want to pay their co-pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing is to be more intentional about collecting,&#8221; said Keith Rahn, who oversees HealthEast clinic billing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=U.S._Chamber_of_Commerce">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a> has been running &#8216;issue ads&#8217; telling Minnesotans that Sen. Norm Coleman has been working to keep government out of health care decisions.  The credit-card companies, not so much.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[*] Which is to say, the premise of the system is that its biggest problem is overconsumption of routine care.  In this regard, it runs against the current of some traditional health plans which have been reducing out-of-pocket shares for some expenditures (e.g. related to chronic conditions like diabetes) because their members are perceived as not being good at picking and paying for the higher-return care.</p>
<p>[**] Amusingly, while Obama issues pages generally link to more detailed <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/issues/HealthCareFullPlan.pdf">briefing documents</a> [PDF], a &#8220;Learn More About the McCain Health Care Reform Plan&#8221; link takes visitors to <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/healthcare/">this page</a> with a few bullet points and an auto-playing video ad, which in turn links back to the issues page for &#8220;the facts.&#8221;</p>
