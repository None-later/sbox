				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Ex-food and energy, inflation is at 0.9% for the past twelvemonth. Even if you include those in the longer measure, <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/17/putting-the-inflation-report-in-perspective/">annual inflation has been 1.7%</a>. (Recall that we paid an average of more than $3.00/gallon <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/wrgp/mogas_history.html">for most of the Spring of 2010</a>, for instance.)</p>
<p>There is a simple reason &#8220;everyone&#8221; expected higher numbers: they were looking at money supply, not circulation.</p>
<p>As Jim Hamilton <a href="http://www.econbrowser.com/archives/2011/02/money_and_reser.html">notes</a>, money is only supply when its being circulated.</p>
<p>The &#8220;intermediaries&#8221; aren&#8217;t intermediates; they&#8217;re <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure">SPOFs</a>. Hamilton&#8217;s graphic tells all:
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fprm5aqHizY/TV2WieaWN2I/AAAAAAAAAeM/UcGGyEhAhmY/s1600/reserves_feb_11.gif"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fprm5aqHizY/TV2WieaWN2I/AAAAAAAAAeM/UcGGyEhAhmY/s320/reserves_feb_11.gif" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>All that &#8220;extra&#8221; money is being kept in mattresses. Financial-Institution-shaped mattresses, but mattresses nonetheless. The velocity of monetary reserves is 0. So the weighted-average velocity of money is much less than the standard formula would imply.</p>
<p>There is inflation out there. For instance, China, whose &#8220;stimulus&#8221; was <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/02/the-political-failure-of-keynesian-economics/71363/">an impossible 17% of its GDP</a> (h/t <a href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/2011/02/let-my-stimulus-go.html">Susan of Texas</a>, of course), is seeing inflation.</p>
<p>The U.S. needs to deal with financial institution mattress stuffing before it can have such problems.</p>
