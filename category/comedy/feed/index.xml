				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p> Just watch this.  It is 1 minute long.<br />Update: added a couple links* </p>
<p>Could it be anymore surreal?</p>
<p>This was from an episode which aired May 12th, 1992!  I asked <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/can-we-please-broaden-our-thinking-in.html" target="_blank">September 2008</a>:   HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS?  HOW MANY FREAKIN’ TIMES DO WE HAVE TO LEARN THE LESSON?</p>
<p> Obviously, the lesson has not been relearned since at least sometime before 1992.  If it had been <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/05/there-is-difference-between-then-and.html" target="_blank">relearned,</a> we would not be here still proposing solutions that sound just like, almost word for word <a href="http://www.taxhistory.org/www/website.nsf/Web/THM1901?OpenDocument" target="_blank">like the 1920&#8217;s.</a>  (start reading at 1920) I mean, it&#8217;s not like <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/04/longest-recession-ever.html" target="_blank">people haven&#8217;</a>t been<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/12/its-big-one-honey-i-know-it.html" target="_blank"> sounding the horn</a> on what <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/01/i-got-your-real-state-of-union-right.html" target="_blank">the results </a>would be from the<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/monetary-policy-im-not-only-not-feeling.html" target="_blank"> proposed solutions</a> in 1992.   Nope, it&#8217;s the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/07/wages-driven-down-now-relative-to.html" target="_blank">same proposals</a> as in 1992, which will produce more of the same.</p>
<p>*In case you are having a problem, here is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlEcbVdCJWg&#038;list=HL1364253320&#038;feature=mh_lolz" target="_blank">full show.</a> The clip part starts at 1:34.<br />*This is <a href="http://www.tubechop.com/watch/1052427" target="_blank">the link for</a> the clip I made that is posted above.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Just a little point of order regarding how bad this economy is.</p>
<p>Lost in Space  120 episodes, 33.2 per season<br />Batman (on twice weekly) 120 episodes, 53.33 per season<br />The Virginian, 249 episodes, 27.67 per season<br />The Beverly Hillbillies, 274 episodes, 30 per season<br />Gilligan&#8217;s Island, 98 episodes, 32.67 per season</p>
<p>New season started this year around September 22.  Last Monday night (10/27/08), CBS sitcom night, my date night with my flower girl&#8230; every one of the shows was a repeat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s bad enough we get 7 minutes of commercials all timed to the other networks, but now they can&#8217;t even get to Halloween before running out of new shows!  </p>
<p>We&#8217;re entering a depression, and we can&#8217;t get new comedy?  Guess I&#8217;ll just have to rely on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3s8sEYzHWQ">real thing</a>.  All 190 of them.</p>
<p>On no!  They&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7txeOlujTc&#038;feature=related">co-oped</a>.</p>
<p>There is only one solution.  We must all immediately call our congress critters and the presidential candidates and demand a bailout for the sitcom industry!  It is our only salvation, our only true hope. It is what worked in the <a href="http://xroads.virginia.edu/~UG03/comedy/historicalcontext.html">past regarding</a> our sanity and stopped us from becoming like the bankers we loath.</p>
