				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hearing that democratic turnout has been stronger in the past primaries prior to Super Tuesday, I used C &#038; L&#8217;s <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/02/05/spokesuper-tuesday-open-thread/">chart data </a>to total up the voter count.  I exclude the states that did not have duel party primaries. The turnout was 14,865,735 democratic to 8,929,123 republican. The republican turnout was 60% of the democratic turnout.</p>
<p>I then went to<a href="http://mwhodges.home.att.net/election2004.htm"> this map</a> to see the “red states” from 2004 and calculated the voter turnout. Super Tuesday had 11 red states voting. Of those, 8 had more democratic voters than republican voters for Super Tuesday. For those 8 states (AR, CO, GA, MO, ND, OK, TN, UT) it was 3,407,658 democratic voters, 2,963,340 republican voters. The republican turnout was 87% of the democratic.</p>
<p>For the 3 remaining states of the 11 &#8220;red&#8221; (AK, AL, AZ)  it was 1,001,540 republican voter turnout to 902,755 democratic voter turnout. The democratic turnout was 90% of the republican.</p>
<p>Interesting no?  Cha, cha, cha changes&#8230;</p>
