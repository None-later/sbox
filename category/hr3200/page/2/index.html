<p><a target=" _blank" href="http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/waxman-blue-dogs-must-relent-on-health-reform-2009-07-24.html">Waxman: Blue Dogs must relent on health reform&#8221;</a> <br />(UPDATE: the linked article has subsequently been rewritten and expanded. What follows is the version from earlier this morning)<br />
<blockquote>House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) says there is &#8220;no alternative&#8221; to having healthcare legislation bypass his committee if Blue Dog Democrats don&#8217;t agree to legislation.</p>
<p>Waxman said if the seven Blue Dogs on his panel do not relent, they could join with the committee&#8217;s Republicans to &#8220;eviscerate&#8221; healthcare reform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t allow them to hand over control of our committee to Republicans,&#8221; Waxman told reporters. </p>
<p>&#8220;I dont see what other alternative we have, because we&#8217;re not going to let them empower Republicans on the committee.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p> I have been wondering about this for a while now. Do you actually need the approval of every committee with jurisdiction over the matter to move a particular piece of legislation to the floor? I don&#8217;t mean practically, you don&#8217;t want to bigfoot some other committee chairman, I mean legally. I don&#8217;t see why and this seems to prove it. We have a bill that passed out of Ways and Means where the tax experts had a look at it and out of Education and Labor where the policy people had their whack plus the committee staff and the Chairman of Energy and Commerce are on board, why would we just concede veto power to a small group of Blue Dogs who have disproportionate representations on that particular committee. And it would appear that the answer is &#8220;we don&#8217;t have to&#8221;.</p>
<p>This is a very promising development for those of us who want to have the whole House pass a bill and so put pressure onto Senate Finance to respond.</p>

                                <p>OR; HR3200 Sec 102 revisited. by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>We first visited the health care reform meme sweeping the right wing of the Blogosphere  with this post <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/07/wingnut-102-how-hr3200-outlaws-private.html">HR3200 abolishes private health insurance</a>. This seemed at first to be a simple confusion of the limits of the following from Sec 102 of the legislation:<br />
<blockquote>1) LIMITATION ON NEW ENROLLMENT.— <br />(A) IN GENERAL.—Except as provided in this paragraph, the individual health insurance issuer offering such coverage does not enroll any individual in such coverage if the first effective date of coverage is on or after the first day of Y1.</p></blockquote>
<p>I pointed out that Sec 102 only refers to &#8216;Grandfathered&#8217; plans and not to &#8216;Qualified&#8217; plans eligible to be included in the new Exchanges. But regular commenter Movie Guy showed that the confusion might be on my part and the result of inadequate attention to Sec 123-144. As he put it in comments:<br />
<blockquote>Section 102 can&#8217;t be viewed in isolation.  Moreover, Section 102 can&#8217;t simply be compared to Section 101 as the magic answer.  There is far more involved than Webb&#8217;s explanations and opinions expressed in the comment posts on the open thread and this main post and related comments.  Aside from reading the entire bill, one would need to read some provisions in existing U.S. Code as cited by the bill.  This provides the broader picture.     </p>
<p>The problem with Section 102 is the clock.     </p>
<p>If this provision of the bill is also adopted by the U.S. Senate and a conference bill is passed and subsequently signed by the President, there will be a gap period that isn&#8217;t being addressed.  The cutoff dates are specific.  Yet, the Administration will not have a &#8220;Commissioner&#8221; until the individual is nominated and confirmed by the U.S. Senate.  The &#8220;Health Benefits Advisory Committee&#8221; will not be in place until the members are selected; the Committee has 18 months to make its initial recommendations.  Moreover, the Committee will be advising the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  And you can&#8217;t call the &#8220;Health Insurance Ombudsman&#8221; until the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221; appoints one.   Recommend reading some of the other sections, including Sections 123-144.     </p>
<p>During the interim period, who will be approving the plans acceptable for the &#8220;Health Insurance Exchange&#8221; under subtitle A of title II?  Based on what criteria?  Those are responsibilities identified for the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221;.     </p>
<p>If you lose your job on or after day 1 of the enacted legislation and your company insurance is terminated, what will you do until such time as the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221;, &#8220;Health Insurance Exchange&#8221;, Commissioner identified criteria, and accepted list of insurance providers are identified?  Who will be able to get new health insurance until that system is up and running?  Not Cobra.  That won&#8217;t be allowed.     </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re starting a business and need health insurance for yourself and a few employees during the gap period, what are your options for health insurance?     </p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Section 102 is insane. </p></blockquote>
<p> Well after wading through a lot of the text of the Bill I came to the conclusion that much of the problem was terminological. Bur rather than waste the research that got me to that point I will include it after the fold. If nothing else it clarifies the proposed timeline.<br />(UPDATE: in comments on the previous post MG has conceded that if my reading below is correct that his concerns have been largely addressed. But given that there are others out there with this same take, I am going to leave this post up as is.)</p>
<p>First from the Bill text:</p>
<p>p.32 DEADLINE.—The Health Benefits Advisory Committee shall recommend initial benefit standards to the Secretary not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act.  </p>
<p>p.35 (1) REVIEW OF RECOMMENDED STANDARDS.—  <br />Not later than 45 days after the date of receipt of benefit standards recommended under section 123 (including such standards as modified under paragraph (2)(B)), the Secretary shall review such standards and shall determine whether to propose  adoption of such standards as a package.   </p>
<p>p.36 (b) ADOPTION OF STANDARDS.—  (1) INITIAL STANDARDS.—Not later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall, through the rulemaking process consistent with subsection (a), adopt an initial set of benefit standards.   </p>
<p>p. 72 (a) ESTABLISHMENT.—There is established within the Health Choices Administration and under the direction of the Commissioner a Health Insurance Exchange in order to facilitate access of individuals and employers, through a transparent process, to a variety of choices of affordable, quality health insurance coverage, including a public health insurance option.  </p>
<p>p. 88-89 2) SOLICITING AND NEGOTIATING BIDS; CONTRACTS.—The Commissioner shall—  (A) solicit bids from QHBP offering entities for the offering of Exchange-participating health benefits plans;  (B) based upon a review of such bids, negotiate with such entities for the offering of such plans; and  (C) enter into contracts with such entities for the offering of such plans through the Health Insurance Exchange under terms (consistent with this title) negotiated between the Commissioner and such entities .</p>
<p>At risk of spoiling the punchline it is necessary to maintain a clear distinction between &#8220;date of the enactment of the Act&#8221; and day one of &#8220;Y 1&#8221;. Which latter is defined as follows:<br />(25) Y1, Y2, ETC..—The terms ‘‘Y1’’ , ‘‘Y2’’, ‘‘Y3’’, ‘‘Y4’’, ‘‘Y5’’, and similar subsequently numbered terms, mean 2013 and subsequent years, respectively.</p>
<p>Before returning to the point lets examine the implementation timeline (from comments)<br />
<blockquote>First unless the Blue Dogs get their way the current plan by the President and House Leadership is to get this bill enacted this year. So lets take the effective date as Jan. 1, 2010.  </p>
<p>Second the clock for the Health Benefits Advisory Committee is not 18 months it is one year and the clock starts not when the members are appointed but at the date of enacting of the bill. Meaning that standards will be in place by Jan 1, 2011.  </p>
<p>Third this gives the Senate a full year to confirm the Commissioner. Nor do I see that the appointment of the Ombudsman makes much difference here, his role seems relatively minor for implementation.  </p>
<p>Fourth, the Commissioner is limited to 45 days to review the standards once received and must have them through the Rule process within 18 months of enactment. Meaning that adopted standards would be in place no later than June 30, 2011.  </p>
<p>Fifth the general outlines of the standards are well established in the bill itself, and if the Advisory Committee develops its specific recommendations in a publicly accessible form (and note that insurance companies have representation on the Committee) insurance companies have almost two years to prepare themselves for contract negotiations in the summer of 2011.  </p>
<p>Sixth which gives the Commissioner and the companies another 18 months for contract approval and administrative implementation. </p></blockquote>
<p>So to repeat the question:<br />
<blockquote>If you lose your job on or after day 1 of the enacted legislation and your company insurance is terminated, what will you do until such time as the &#8220;Commissioner&#8221;, &#8220;Health Insurance Exchange&#8221;, Commissioner identified criteria, and accepted list of insurance providers are identified? Who will be able to get new health insurance until that system is up and running? </p></blockquote>
<p> Well on my reading if you lose your job and so your insurance between &#8220;day 1 of the enacted legislation&#8221; and &#8220;day 1 of Y 1&#8221; you can get insurance just where  you always would have if you lost your job between tomorrow and the date of enactment. As a matter of personal convenience you might ask if the company plans to participate in the Exchange after it goes into operation Jan 1. 2013 but I just am not seeing the inherent insanity some others do. Instead I see two fundamental mistakes. One the belief that the clocks start from the point that the Commissioner and Committee members are confirmed rather than the date the act is enacted. And the second a confusion between that date and Y 1 as referenced in Sec 102, i.e. 2013..</p>

                                <p>by Bruce Webb</p>
<p>Press release from the House Ways and Means Committee dated Saturday July 18th. <a href="http://waysandmeans.house.gov/News.asp?FormMode=release&#038;ID=919">CBO Scores Confirms Deficit Neutrality of Health Reform Bill</a><br />
<blockquote>Washington, D.C. &#8212; The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released estimates this evening confirming for the first time that H.R. 3200, America’s Affordable Health Choices Act, is deficit neutral over the 10-year budget window – and even produces a $6 billion surplus.  CBO estimated more than $550 billion in gross Medicare and Medicaid savings.  More importantly, the bill includes a comprehensive array of delivery reforms to set the stage for lowering the future growth in health care costs.   </p>
<p>Net Medicare and Medicaid savings of $465 billion, coupled with the $583 billion revenue package reported today by the House Committee on Ways and Means, fully finance the previously estimated $1.042 trillion cost of reform, which will provide affordable health care coverage for 97% of Americans.  </p>
<p>“This fulfills the strong commitment of the President and House leadership to enact health reform on a deficit-neutral basis,” said Chairman Henry A. Waxman, Chairman Charles B. Rangel, and Chairman George Miller.  “The reforms included in this legislation will help control health care costs and expand access to quality, affordable coverage to all Americans in a fiscally-responsible manner.” </p>
<p>The estimates also cover important reinvestments in Medicare and Medicaid, including phasing in the closing of the “donut” hole in the Medicare drug benefit.  The bill’s long-term reform of Medicare’s physician fee schedule to eliminate the potential 21 percent cut in fees, and put payments on a sustainable basis for the future, will cost about $245 billion.  Those costs, however, are not included in the net calculations above, as they will be absorbed under the upcoming statutory “pay go” legislation that is pending in the House.</p></blockquote>
<p> Good news as far as it goes, at least if you want to get as close to universal health care coverage as possible, and certainly you can expect progressives to run with it. But it raises some questions about the differences between &#8216;budget neutrality&#8217;, &#8216;surplus&#8217;, and savings. Rather than spoil the party I&#8217;ll move that discussion under the fold.</p>
<p>People who have been following this debate may be scratching their heads. On Tuesday the CBO scored HR3200 as adding $1.048 billion to the deficit over ten years. Late Friday that score was changed to adding  $239 billion over that same period, that is over the course of three days we somehow cut $809 billion off the cost. By Saturday night all of a sudden we now have a score of a $6 billion surplus, as close to dead even as makes no difference. So what happened? Did the bill change? Did CBO cave and change its methods? Well &#8216;No&#8217; and &#8216;No&#8217;. It turns out that the answers CBO returns depend, as they should, on the precise nature of the question.</p>
<p>The first thing of note is that while these numbers are perfectly accurate in that if you score the impact of HR3200 and some accompaning legislation related to Pay-Go to be voted on soon you will get the $6 billion surplus, but under the cautious methods used by CBO this is somewhat to put the cart before the horse. Because the latest message from the CBO Director&#8217;s Blog, released early Saturday morning still puts the matter as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Yesterday CBO released a preliminary analysis, conducted with the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), of H.R. 3200, the America’s Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009, as introduced by several House committees on July 14. Earlier this week, CBO released a preliminary report on the health insurance coverage provisions of the bill; this latest report added analysis of the other provisions.</p>
<p>According to CBO’s and JCT’s assessment, enacting H.R. 3200 would result in a net increase in the federal budget deficit of $239 billion over the 2010-2019 period. That estimate reflects a projected 10-year cost of the bill’s insurance coverage provisions of $1,042 billion, partly offset by net spending changes that CBO estimates would save $219 billion over the same period, and by revenue provisions that JCT estimates would increase federal revenues by about $583 billion over those 10 years.</p>
<p>By the end of the 10-year period, in 2019, the coverage provisions would add $202 billion to the federal deficit, CBO and JCT estimate. That increase would be partially offset by net cost savings of $50 billion and additional revenues of $86 billion, resulting in a net increase in the deficit of an estimated $65 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>First thing to note is that the last sentence is awkwardly phrased. That $65 billion is NOT the ten-year score but instead the score in Year 10, i.e. 2019. It basically represents the continuing cost of HR3200 going forward. But more importantly CBO is here sticking to the $239 billion figure (as bolded by me).</p>
<p>But whether you start from a $239 billion 10-year deficit or a $6 billion 10-year surplus this is quite a remarkeable achievement. Republicans who just days ago were crowing that the cost of providing near universal coverage was going to mean trillions added to the deficit are going to see that message stomped on. For example McConnell was reduced on Meet the Press to claiming this would cost &#8220;a quarter of a trillion dollars&#8221; perhaps hoping people are still scared by the label rather than the number. Because in the context of a $750 billion TARP package it is hard to scare someone with &#8216;$30 billion a year&#8217;.</p>
<p>Okay. So lets back off a little. Is it really fair to say that the changes to health care under HR3200 really save money compared to the status quo? Maybe yes, and maybe no, it all depends on where you are situated. The reality is that it is going to cost a bunch of medium term money to extend our current health care system in a way that covers 97% of the legal non-elderly population. On a national basis a good part of that will be offset by moving care delivery that is now non-compensated to being compensated. Just as a minor example we should be spending significantly less on collection agencies and medical bankruptcies. And billions of dollars formerly drawn from charity to run various hospitals can be directed other places. Plus we can save tens of billions of dollars if we just had every American on the right combination of blood pressure and cholesterol medication right from the git-go rather than after that heart attack or stroke. So there will be savings, and nationally there should long-term be net savings, and ultimately maybe huge net savings as we get per capita costs in line with other developed countries.</p>
<p>But the key point is that little to none of that is captured using CBO scoring methods. Savings to states, hospitals and individuals simply don&#8217;t register, nor do things like increased productivity from fewer lost work days. Now these kind of macro changes may well show up in CBO productions such as their Long Term Outlook but don&#8217;t register at the ground level of bill scoring.</p>
<p>In the cold light of day a big chunk of this is going to have to be paid for with a tax increase of around $500 billion dollars over ten years. And for the people tasked to pay it this isn&#8217;t going to save them anything over the status quo, not near term. Meaning that progressives shouldn&#8217;t get too far ahead of themselves crowing about a $6 billion net paper surplus.</p>
<p>I am warning about this because there is quite the excitement brewing in places like dKos among people who have confused the concepts of budget accounting and cash flow. Budgets and budget scoring are mysterious beasts and neither deficits or surpluses necessarily mean what they suggest once reported in the media.</p>
<p>In other words &#8220;I don&#8217;t think that $6 billion surplus means what you think it means&#8221;.</p>
