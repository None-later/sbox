				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the nice things about the Kauffman Foundation&#8217;s Blogger Conference is the time to let the mind wander and look at data after having your brain scoured.</p>
<p>One of the worst things is realizing too late that you&#8217;ve got a Really Ugly Graphic, and most of the people who could help with it are gone.</p>
<p>Four hours ago at dinner, I was sitting between <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/">Brad DeLong</a> and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/timduy/">Tim Duy</a> (who pointed out some good contemporary performers of Real Country Music), but I didn&#8217;t have this graphic with me.  Now Tim is on a plane and Brad is teaching students, and my best option is to ask the AB commentariat if the following graphic scares them as much as it does me.
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-949gkDNHmYA/T3Z6svugnBI/AAAAAAAAA6c/oIQn9YQInI8/s1600/M1LXRES201202.PNG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-949gkDNHmYA/T3Z6svugnBI/AAAAAAAAA6c/oIQn9YQInI8/s320/M1LXRES201202.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Even given my hobby-horse attitude toward Excess Reserve (i.e., the Sheer Unmitigated Contempt with which I treat the idea that reserves in general—let alone <em>Excess</em> Reserves—should &#8220;earn&#8221; interest), the dropping-off-a-cliff impression (and the overall downward trend, even keeping in mind that we do not Seasonally Adjust Excess Reserves, and therefore Seasonal Effects are clear) almost seems to explain why the 32nd month of the &#8220;recovery&#8221; feels as if it&#8217;s just possibly starting something.</p>
<p>To be fair—and a hearty &#8220;thank you&#8221; to <a href="http://oldprof.typepad.com/">Jeff Miller of A Dash of Insight</a> for reminding me that most people believe the Fed concentrates on M2, not M1—the broader index shows an upward trend (again, discounting the recent decline as a Seasonal Effect):</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6NmmJ74qFfA/T3Z9TdVA8sI/AAAAAAAAA6o/L-KnowzOnh4/s1600/M2LXRES201202.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-6NmmJ74qFfA/T3Z9TdVA8sI/AAAAAAAAA6o/L-KnowzOnh4/s320/M2LXRES201202.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Otoh, an overall ca. 5% increase in &#8220;Net M2,&#8221; as it were, over a year in which the dollar has increasingly appeared to be the only reasonable &#8220;Safe Haven&#8221; doesn&#8217;t seem all that large either.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve yet to play with the data beyond this, so I leave it to the AB comentariat:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do you believe there is something here?</li>
<li>If so, any guesses what it is? Or anything you want to know about it?</li>
<li>If not, what else should we be looking at where Excess Reserves may/should/will (depending upon your degree of certainty) affect the value of the data and/or Real Economic Growth?</li>
</ol>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A commenter at <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_11/explaining_to_mitch_mcconnell033431.php">Steve Benen&#8217;s Washington Monthly blog</a> was grousing (correctly, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/11/hiroshima-nagasaki-and-largest-absolute.html#comments">as spencer notes in comments</a>) that Benen had allocated all of the 2009 change (read:drop) in private-sector jobs to Obama, while GWB was in office <s>for the first 19.5 days</s>during the time the employment data for January was gathered.</p>
<p>Turns out that there were 841,000 private-sector jobs lost in January of 2009—the most in any month in the 2000s—so it might have made a difference.*</p>
<p>I assumed that, since the population continually increases, that was probably the largest monthly job loss since the data was first recorded in January of 1939.</p>
<p>I was wrong.  By a <strong>wide</strong> margin.  The Top 30 single-month drops in U.S. Private Sector employment history since February of 1939:
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0siKeJp1lQ4/Tr19-m6kSsI/AAAAAAAAAp0/qz9LIVlXmvU/s1600/ToTop30USPRIVdrops.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-0siKeJp1lQ4/Tr19-m6kSsI/AAAAAAAAAp0/qz9LIVlXmvU/s320/ToTop30USPRIVdrops.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>The highlighted months are since the beginning of NBER&#8217;s declaration of the Great Recession.  But it appears that V-J Day also signalled an end to employment for more than 1.75 million people.</p>
<p>*Note, by the way, that November and December of 2008 are also in the Top Ten, so calling the January, 2009, layoffs part of the normal post-Xmas letdown appears dubious.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to look at the <a href="http://graphicsweb.wsj.com/documents/NILF1111/#term=">WSJ job database</a>, suspecting what I might find, but currently lack the bandwidth in a major way.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Noah took some (more) time from his thesis (&#8220;distraction from productive activity&#8221;) and did the dirty work. Apparently, <a href="http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.com/2011/11/bad-astronomy-does-some-bad-economics.html">being a STEM undergraduate isn&#8217;t the path to Nirvana</a>:*</p>
<blockquote><p>I went through the Wall Street Journal database that Phil cites, and found the following unemployment rates:</p>
<li>Genetics: 7.4% unemployed </li>
<li>Biochemical Sciences: 7.1% unemployed </li>
<li>Neuroscience: 7.2% unemployed </li>
<li>Materials Engineering and Materials Science: 7.5% unemployed </li>
<li>Computer Engineering: 7.0% unemployed </li>
<li>Biomedical Engineering: 5.9% unemployed </li>
<li>General Engineering: 5.9% unemployed </li>
<li>Engineering Mechanics Physics and Science: 6.5% unemployed </li>
<li>Chemistry: 5.1% unemployed </li>
<li>Electrical Engineering: 5.0% unemployed </li>
<li>Molecular Biology: 5.3% unemployed </li>
<li>Mechanical Engineering and Related Technologies: 6.6% unemployed
<p>Compare these with a <a href="http://www.mymoneyblog.com/unemployment-rates-vs-level-of-education.html">5.0% unemployment rate for all bachelor&#8217;s degree holders</a> in 2010.</li>
</blockquote>
<p>And why do those Astronomy and Astrophysics people** have jobs?<br />
<blockquote>Earth to [Phil Plait of] Bad Astronomy: your short-list of fully-employed science majors is totally cherry-picked&#8230;.And all those astronomers who have plenty of jobs? Guess what: they&#8217;re employed because <em>they work for the government</em>. Yep, that&#8217;s right, the same government whose ability to provide employment Phil laughs at.</p></blockquote>
<p>*Raise your hand if you&#8217;re surprised by this. Mine is not up.</p>
<p>**Full disclosure: I speak as someone whose wife&#8217;s cousin, with a Ph.D. in Astronomy &#038; Astrophysics, currently has a Fellowship in the Astronomy department at <a href="http://berkeley.edu/">DeLongville</a>.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Brad DeLong has two posts, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/11/ezra-klein-shrinking-the-presidency-back-down-to-size-obama-2009-10-b.html">one from Ezra &#8220;I&#8217;m a liberal who is safe for the Washington Post&#8221; Klein</a> and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/11/mike-konczal-grades-president-obamas-economic-performance-in-early-2010-c-.html">one from Mike &#8220;I actually looked at the data&#8221; Konczal</a>.</p>
<p>Brad deals with Ezra&#8217;s folly:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think a B+ is too high a grade&#8211;largely because one big task of 2009 was to set up the situation so that you could still make policy in 2010 and 2011 if it turned out that you needed to.</p></blockquote>
<p>And that&#8217;s without mentioning that the Administration violated the first law of Presidencies; the one George Effing W. Bush knew well: give your base something early, so they know you didn&#8217;t just come to them for their votes.  Bush gave his &#8220;faith-based initiatives.&#8221; Obama—who campaigned on card check, principal reduction, and his father being Jor-El—only went for big-ticket items.</p>
<p>Mike goes in detail over the ground I discussed <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/11/argument-against-first-derivative.html">here</a>: the idiocy that is the 2010 State of the Union Address, delivered 27 January 2010.  With contemporaneous detail. Go <a href="http://rortybomb.wordpress.com/2011/11/09/what-can-we-say-about-president-obamas-economic-performance-in-2010/">Read the Whole Thing</a>.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just bad economics, it&#8217;s bad politics.  Which brings me back to <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/11/matthew-yglesiass-theory-of-the-obama-administration-in-2010-excessive-reliance-on-the-second-derivative.html">Matt&#8217;s lazy first graphic</a>, which means I&#8217;m going to beat the dead horse again. Below the fold.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I called it &#8220;lazy&#8221; because it is; it&#8217;s raw data, and you don&#8217;t just look at raw data in isolation, at least if you&#8217;re sane. You don&#8217;t do it if you&#8217;re an economist, and you don&#8217;t do it if you&#8217;re a politician.</p>
<p>As an economist, you don&#8217;t just look at unemployment; you look at unemployment in relation to other things—causes, effects.  GDP gaps, demographics, transitions from one sector to another, you name it.  It&#8217;s nice to see data, and flows, but they have to mean something.</p>
<p>Political analysts—if they&#8217;re any good—don&#8217;t look at data in isolation either, especially when they have Austan Goolsbee, Alan Kreuger, Christina Romer, and even Lawrence H. Summers working with them. Any one of those four—let alone all of them, often in the same room, if not always the same discussion—could tell David Axelrod that the U.S. needs to create between 110,000 and 150,000 jobs a month just to tread water on unemployment.  Maybe they ballpark it at 125,000.  So instead of Matt&#8217;s original graphic, David Axelrod would have seen something like this one:
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A3V4EsiFkhQ/TrtVNWyXZ0I/AAAAAAAAApo/wi5sel31QDA/s1600/NewMatt.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A3V4EsiFkhQ/TrtVNWyXZ0I/AAAAAAAAApo/wi5sel31QDA/s320/NewMatt.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>And if he&#8217;s still talking about how his boss will have nothing to worry about in two years, well, I&#8217;m certain that Goolsbee, Krueger, Romer, or Summers—all of whom were still at the White House during that time—would have set him straight.</p>
<p>And there would have been another policy, a change of course.  Or a really bad Unforced Error.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by <strong>Linda Beale</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/10/reids-plan-for-job-creation.html">Reid&#8217;s Plan for Job Creation</a>
<p>Harry Reid announced on Wednesday (Oct. 5) that the Senate would take up Jobs Act legislation (S. 1549) soon, but that the offsets in the president&#8217;s proposals would be replaced by a 5% surtax on those making more than a million that would raise about $445 million.  See Bolen &#038; Lorenzo, Senate to Debate Jobs Bill Paid For with 5% Millionaire Surtax, BNA Daily Tax Report 194 DTR G-7 (Oct 5, 2011).</p>
<p>Note that this means that, once again, Congress will punt on the question of taxing fund managers fairly on their compensation, since the carried interest provision would be one of the offsets replaced by this provision.  <a name="more"></a>  The carried interest provision should be passed no matter what other offsets are used.  It is an unfair provision that treats fund managers as a specially protected category of worker with preferential rates on their compensation income.  Time to end it, once and for all.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, GOP senator Hatch complained that this small surcharge on millionaires would be a &#8220;massive&#8221; tax increase on &#8220;small businesses&#8221;.  Id. How many times do we have to remind Congress that most small businesses don&#8217;t make millions in profits, that those who have millions can pay a 5% tax without undue distress (compared to those with a ten dollar bill being able to support their family with food and shelter), and that 5% of $1 million is not a &#8220;massive&#8221; tax increase.  50% of $1 million might be, but 5% is simply not.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When someone attempts to impede democracy <a href="http://bentleyvillepresbyterian.com/2011/03/27/march-27-2011-john-831-47-the-truth/">actions are good things</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Writer and naturalist Henry David Thoreau was once locked up for refusing to pay a poll tax.  He opposed the tax on moral grounds – in a democracy, he argued, a man shouldn’t have to pay to vote&#8230;.</p>
<p>That night, so the story goes, Thoreau looked up from his jail cell to see Ralph Waldo Emerson&#8230;standing outside.  Emerson looked at him and asked, &#8220;Henry, why are you in there?&#8221;  Thoreau fired right back: &#8220;Ralph, why are you out there?&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>The man outside the bars may be every bit as much a prisoner as the one inside.  Or even more so, if his so-called freedom is built on a foundation of denial and lies.</p>
<p>Now, Thoreau was anything but a Christian.  That particular idea, though, was downright Biblical.  It’s more or less what Jesus is getting at [in John 8:31-47].  Jesus is comparing two kinds of freedom: the outward kind, built on a foundation of happy lies and outright denial, which in the end turns out to be just another kind of slavery; and the inward kind, which comes from a clean conscience before God, and can never be taken away.</p></blockquote>
<p>Far be it for me to cite The Sequel; I&#8217;ll take Bentleyville&#8217;s current Presbyterian minister* at his word. And tell anyone who happens to be <a href="http://occupywallst.org/">in the area of One Liberty Plaza</a> this afternoon to say &#8220;hello.&#8221;</p>
<p>*Full disclosure: one of the previous Ministers is an ex-roommate of mine.  That said, the above was found from a Google search, purely a fortuitous coincidence. At least as far as I know.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I still think Obama is toast—a result of his own making, since he’s really the apotheosis of a government-hating Republican who never tries to do anything because he’s afraid it would succeed.  He’s basically Jon Huntsman, <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/2011/09/just-another-right-wing-corporatist-republican-elitist.html" target="_blank">economic policy and all</a>, with a slightly better social policy—or at least a willingness not to try to compete globally in the 21st century using employment policies that were outdated in the 19th. (Short version: you might be able, in general, to exclude 55% of your potential workforce—women and gay men—if you have the population of an India or a China. You can’t do it when you have 1/3 or less of their population; you need a market that is open to everyone, which means you need social policies to match.)
<p>But there are way in which he is a Bad Republican (traditional definition—think Gerald Ford’s Presidency), and those, as much as anything else,are what has destroyed his re-election chances.  Not to mention U.S. employment data.</p>
<p>I’d like to think I’m wrong, but let’s look at the data, comparing the last three recessions: the ones with so-called “jobless recoveries.”  In <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/07/mitt-romney-recession-recovery-chart_n_952872.html">the grand tradition of Mitt Romney</a>, let’s look at job growth over the following 24 months.*  First, the Private Sector:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-JgEAhR6Vh30/TmlKp-2zN9I/AAAAAAAAAiE/QtIwQnxIF2I/s1600-h/joblessrecoveries001Private%25255B3%25255D.png"><img title="joblessrecoveries001Private" border="0" alt="joblessrecoveries001Private" src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/-VBK4S3hmFuc/TmlKqXxSoQI/AAAAAAAAAiI/Eef2vfTWcns/joblessrecoveries001Private_thumb%25255B1%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="433"></a> </p>
<p>The first thing we notice is that The George W. Bush-Mankiw-Hubbard “Recovery” Really Massively Sucked for U.S. Private Sector Employment.** Two-thirds of those post-recession months were negative, and the negatives were more than 1/3 again worse than the gains.  Even the 24 months that follow the 1980 recession—<strong><em>half of which were the first 3/4 of the 1982 recession</em></strong>—show a net positive gain in Private Sector Employment.</p>
<p>But the second thing is that the Obama Administration really isn’t doing that poorly in Private Sector Employment. It’s rather similar to the George H. W. Bush Administration.***  The loss months are slightly more severe than the gain months (about 5%), but there are 2 gain-months for every loss-month.  It’s still a “jobless recovery”—as was the post-1991 era—in that producing slightly over 1,000,000 jobs in a 24 month period is falling behind the growth in available workers, but it’s not a disaster, <em>if the criterion is the recovery of private-sector hiring.</em></p>
<p>Sadly for BarryO—again, I consider this what the tennis-playing Brad DeLong calls an “unforced error,” a direct result of the errors of his priors—there is also employment in the non-private sector.  Which both Bushes knew that, the “small government Democrat” appears not to:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-TivClZGPVXk/TmlKqq9WxPI/AAAAAAAAAiM/ub16NriE2cg/s1600-h/joblessrecoveries002Public%25255B7%25255D.png"><img title="joblessrecoveries002Public" border="0" alt="joblessrecoveries002Public" src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/-v6lJHxC-QEE/TmlKq7ZbigI/AAAAAAAAAiQ/SBSTCcdvL0k/joblessrecoveries002Public_thumb%25255B3%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="388"></a> </p>
<p>On a proportionate basis, George H. W. Bush oversaw as large a post-recession <em>expansion</em> of Government workers as Barack H. Obama has overseen a <em>reduction</em> in those workers.  This is even before one considers that at least three of those <strong>six</strong> positive months—a figured dwarfed by W’s 15 months of public-sector worker increase, let alone his father’s 19 months—are due to <em>temporary </em>hiring of U.S. Census workers. March, April, and May of 2010 show net gains because of Federal hiring that is more than completely reversed by September.  Great “Recovery Summer,” that was!</p>
<p>But if we really want to be fair to Barack Obama, we would have to break this down further.  After all,while the data is national, the breakdowns are not always so:</p>
<p><a href="http://lh3.ggpht.com/-ixsFB81KutI/TmlKrJ1dXyI/AAAAAAAAAiU/ktKic7popBQ/s1600-h/joblessrecoveries003PublicBreakdown%25255B11%25255D.png"><img title="joblessrecoveries003PublicBreakdown" border="0" alt="joblessrecoveries003PublicBreakdown" src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/-KsZOycEENCc/TmlKrnQy11I/AAAAAAAAAiY/CC_ht95AvIg/joblessrecoveries003PublicBreakdown_thumb%25255B5%25255D.png?imgmax=800" width="644" height="459"></a> </p>
<p>Federal government employment—now including the ever-expanding Department of Homeland Security, and with a military that continues to fight (at least) three wars—has been essentially flat during the “recovery”period.  The damage has been done extensively at the State and, especially, Local levels.</p>
<p>Part of this is simply that the 2007-2009 recession was longer and deeper than the other two (18 months long v. 8 for each of the previous two; more than 7.5 million private-sector jobs compared to just over 1 million in 1991 and just under 2 million in 2001).  That’s a lot more time and a lot less money flowing into taxes and budget-balancing requirements.</p>
<p>But if I were Barack H. Obama, and if I really wanted to be re-elected, the speech I would be giving tonight wouldn’t be about extending tax credits or capital amortization credits—with or without the idiocy of budgetary offsets—but direct state aid. Billions of dollars of it.  Without offsets. The speech would run something like this:</p>
<blockquote><p>The latest few years have been difficult for you.  Almost every state in the Union has to balance their budgets, and with record levels of unemployment and job losses, that’s not easy to do.  So they made decisions that affected you, your children, and your friends. They laid off police officers, firefighters, teachers, librarians, surveyors, road repair personnel, and trash collectors. They’ve cut back hours at the DMV, Social Security, and Employment Offices.  They’ve made it more difficult to get an appointment to get health insurance for your children, support to buy healthy food for you and your children.  Your classrooms are more crowded, your property taxes are higher, and you’re getting less for your money while you have to put in more effort.</p>
<p>The Federal Government doesn’t have to balance its budget, and the bond market has given us a rare opportunity to borrow money for less than it will cost us.  I plan to take full advantage of that now, so that your children will have food, your streets will be safer, your opportunities for education will be greater, and the services for which you pay will be more available.</p>
<p>The private sector is rebuilding and restaffing, but that will—as it has in the past, as it almost always does—take time.  But they cannot rebuild if there is no demand, and you cannot demand things if you cannot pay for them. So, along with $1T in infrastructure improvements to be made over the next 15 years, I will tomorrow send a bill to Congress to triple the total of the two previous grants-in-aid to the States that were made as part of the ARRA.</p>
<p>Now you have heard many people—and to my shame, I am one of them—who live in fear of deficits. They pretend that the government “has to be like a family”—a family that never takes out a mortgage, never borrows to buy a car, never needs a loan to pay for schooling or training, and never uses a credit card.  I’ve seen families like that. They live on the streets of Honolulu and New York City and Chicago and Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Virginia, and Cincinnati, Ohio, and Detroit, Michigan, and Paint Creek, Texas.  They’re impoverished.</p>
<p>The United States is not impoverished, and I will not allow it to become so. We will rebuild opportunity now and build our superhighways—information and otherwise—for life in the 21st and 22nd Centuries.  The bankers—grateful for the bailouts that have been heaped upon them by my predecessor and myself—are willing to loan us money for less than the cost of inflation. We would be foolish not to borrow.  Even as those of you who can are refinancing your houses, the U.S. government will—<em>as families do and should</em>—borrow now to make a better life for our children and their children.</p>
<p>We have a unique opportunity. We have massive unemployment because the states do not have the money to employ and hire workers—workers who help keep our streets and homes safe, who keep our roads in good condition, who educate our children, who find us opportunities for work and ways to keep us healthy so that we can do that work.  And the bankers are telling us, “We will give you that money for free!”  And some people are telling you that we should not take that money.</p>
<p>We have given the bankers enough.  Now, they are willing to Pay It Forward, to give some small portion of that money back to us for less than it will cost them to do it. I intend to take that money and use it to make a better present—and the chance for a better future—for the American family.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yeah, I want a pony, too.</p>
<p>*All data following derived from FRED(R). <br />**Let us leave aside whether this was a feature or a bug of that Administration<br />***It is left as an exercise that GHWB was a one-term president.</p>
