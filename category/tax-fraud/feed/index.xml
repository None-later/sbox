<p>Tom puts an end to the &#8220;oh, they were just mistakes&#8221; tax argument:<br />
<blockquote>The thing about [Sarah Palin taking her spouse and especially her kids with her on business trips]&#8230;is that the attempt to edit the terms of the trips after the fact could be seen as evidence of intent to commit of federal income tax fraud—the tax-law bloggers are in agreement that the Palins&#8217; tax returns incorrectly treated those reimbursements, which generally have to be treated as taxable income, and a question is whether the error was an innocent mistake—and/or defraud the Alaskan taxpayer more directly.</p></blockquote>
<p>In this case, it really <strong><em>is</em></strong> the cover-up that Reveals Preferences.</p>
