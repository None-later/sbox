<div>Romney&#8217;s plan calls for linking the Pentagon&#8217;s base budget to Gross Domestic Product, and allowing the military to spend at least $4 dollars out of every $100 the American economy produces.”
</p>
</div>
<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://money.cnn.com/2012/05/10/news/economy/romney-defense-spending/index.htm">Defense spending to spike $2.1 trillion under Romney</a></i>, CNN Money, May 10, 2012.)</div>
<div></div>
<div>In a post here two weeks ago I noted that peculiar proposal of Romney’s, and also mentioned my dismay that neither the Obama campaign nor (to my knowledge) any other mainstream-media outlet had mentioned it.  I titled the post <i><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/07/crony-capitalism-and-its-variety-of.html">Crony Capitalism and Its Variety of Flavors</a></i>.  The occasion for the post was the Romney campaign’s then-newly-invigorated “crony capitalism” schtik featuring, of course, Solyndra. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I said in the post that, given Romney’s open (if unnoticed) proposal to untether actual national-security <i>needs</i> from national-security <i>spending</i>and attaching it instead to GDP, its purpose is utterly unrelated to national security.  It’s unabashedly “a stunningly perverse pinstriped-patronage version of Keynsian economics,” I said. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My post got about as much attention as the May 10 CNNMoney report.  But now the Obama campaign<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/frame_game/2012/08/obama_s_ad_against_military_spending_have_polls_shifted_on_the_defense_budget_.html"> has a new ad out</a> highlighting the absurdity of Romney’s plan to <i>increase</i> defense spending—presumably (although the ad doesn’t say this) so that we’ll be prepared when Romney clumsily gets us into an unnecessary war.  (Current candidates as enemies: Britain and the Palestinians, in addition to Iran.)  The ad is excellent.  But it would be even better if it mentioned that Romney’s spending plan doesn’t even <i>purport</i>to be tied to defense <i>needs</i>, but instead to, um, GDP.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It really should point this out and should note the only possible explanation for that.  So should Obama himself.</div>
