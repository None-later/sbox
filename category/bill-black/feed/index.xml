<blockquote><p>And what did the—finally, the numbers that just came in in the <i>New York Times</i> article very recently that showed that—in the first year of recovery from the recession, which was taking place under President Obama, of the gains in income, 93 percent of those gains went to the top 1 percent in wealth. And we are in the greatest period of inequality measured since the Great Depression. And in terms of wealth, as opposed to income, the top 1 percent now have greater wealth than the bottom 90 percent of us in America. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>So while we can justly criticize that Romney and Ryan would make inequality worse, under this administration inequality has reached record levels. And you can see from all of the inside story things that are coming out from Barofsky, from Connaughton, from Sheila Bair, that the programs have not—of the Obama administration have overwhelmingly not been designed to help regular people, as opposed to, in the infamous phrase of Timothy Geithner, the Treasury secretary, to foam the runways to protect the banks from crashing and burning.</p></blockquote>

<p>Guest post:  Occupied Media: Interview With Professor William K. Black</p>
<p>So, this video took far too long to post due to technical difficulties (and we ultimately ended up posting without video). However, the content is amazing. The interview is with esteemed law professor Bill Black who has been a tireless advocate for reform of the financial system and prosecution of the fraudsters that brought our economy to its knees. The title of his book really says it all: <i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Way-Rob-Bank-Own/dp/0292706383">The Best Way to Rob a Bank is to Own One</a></i>.<br />     <br />Professor Black is an Associate Professor of Economics and Law at the University of Missouri, Kansas City, a white-collar criminologist and a former financial regulator. He blogs at <a href="http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/">New Economic Perspectives</a> and tweets at @WilliamKBlack. Professor Black has been an advocate of the Occupy Wall Street Movement and he has been remarkably generous with his time.</p>
<p>A huge thanks to video editor Paul Shockey for getting this interview out despite the numerous technical problems.</p>
