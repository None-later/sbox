<blockquote>&#8230; I get calls. The White House insists that it is absolutely, positively not going to cave or indeed even negotiate over the debt ceiling — that it rejected the coin option as a gesture of strength, as a way to put the onus for avoiding default entirely on the GOP. Truth or famous last words? I guess we’ll find out.</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is that the White House&#8217;s definition of what it means to cave may be quite different from my own. If the White House believes entitlements need to be cut, and agrees to &#8220;strengthen&#8221; programs in this way, is that a cave? Maybe the &#8220;or even negotiate&#8221; clause covers this, but I&#8217;m wary.</p></blockquote>
