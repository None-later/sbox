<p> Romney, Family Business, Carried Interest, and potential conflicts of interest</p>
<p>Just a quick note this morning on an interesting article in the October 29, 2012 edition of The Nation magazine, Lee Fang, Romney Family Business: Investors in Tagg Romney&#8217;s firm, Solamere Capital, could hit the jackpot if his father wins, The Nation (Oct. 29, 2012), at 18.</p>
<p>Marc Leder, the wealthy investor who hosted the Romney fundraiser last May in Boca Raton where Romney made his comment disparaging almost half of Americans as personally irresponsible and happy to depend on government, is just one of several high-powered investors linked to the Romney family business empire.  The Nation article describes it this way.<br />
<blockquote>In 2008, &#8230; [Romney&#8217;s] eldest son Tagg and his chief fundraiser Spencer Zwick formed Solamere Capital, a private equity firm &#8230;. What Tagg lacked in experience in the world of high finance, he made up for with a vast network of political connections forged through his father, who seeded the firm with $10 million and was the featured speaker at its first investor conference in January 2010. &#8230;<br />Unlike most private equity firms&#8230;, Solamere specializes in something else:  billing itself as a &#8216;fund of funds&#8217; with &#8216;unparalleled networks&#8217;, it provides investors with &#8216;unique access&#8217; to an elite set of other private equity firms and hedge funds. <br />***</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote><strong>Solamere, a firm predicated on its founders&#8217; relationship with Romney, presents a channel for powerful investors to influence the White House if he wins.</strong> &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The looming matters range from general matters that affect all private equity firms&#8211;such as tax changes or the new rules mandated by the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill&#8211;to more specific concerns relating to businesses owned or controlled by Solamere&#8217;s partner firms.   Many of these businesses, in fact, depend on government contracts; indeed, some have been accused of fleecing taxpayers&#8230;. A Romney administration could directly affect the profitability of these companies&#8211;and, by extension, potentially the success of Tagg&#8217;s venture&#8230;.<br />Take Leder &#8230; whose Sun Capital firm bought a stake in the Scooter Store last year.  The company, known for its ubiquitous television ads promising seemingly free motorized wheelchairs for Medicare beneficiaries, has struggled as the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that governs the programs, implements rules to curb rampant billing fraud.  &#8230;80 percent of the claims for scooters and power wheelchairs did not meet Medicare requirements, meaning that $492 million a year is being improperly spent.  In 2007, the Scooter Store gave up $13 million in Medicare payments and paid $4 million to settle with the Justice Department over allegations that it had overbiled for its electric wheelchairs. &#8230; Disclosures &#8230; suggest that pressuring the government is the only way [Leder&#8217;s] investment in Scooter Store can turn a profit.  Since Leder&#8217;s firm invested in the Scooter Store, the company has spent nearly $900,000 on lobbyists to push back on [the] two latest challenges to its motorized-scooter empire.<br />***<br />Records indicate the firm [Solamere Capital] was incorporated at the same Boston office where Romney&#8217;s campaign headquarters had been located, and later shared an office address with Romney&#8217;s PAC. Zwick &#8230; has been referred to as Romney&#8217;s &#8216;sixth son.&#8217;  And by all accounts, he&#8217;s one of the most trusted advisers in Romney&#8217;s circle. &#8230; [I]n February 2008, Solamer Capital registered with the State of Massachusetts. Zwick and Tagg joined with Eric Scheuermann, a former Jupiter Partners executive, as the three managing partners of the firm.  Scheuermann was the only one with prior experience in private equity. &#8230; However, success for the firm seemed preordained. &#8230; Solamere surpassed its $200 million fundraising goal with help from an elite set of &#8216;high net worth&#8217; individuals, many of whom are close Romney allies. &#8230; The three managing partners will receive $16.8 million in management fees over the first six years, as well as &#8216;performance-based incentive&#8217; pay. &#8230; A tax return filed by Mitt and Ann Romney, made public in September, showed that Solamere has used an array of Cayman Islands entities &#8230; [It] likely uses &#8216;blocker corporations&#8217; to help its tax-exempt investors avoid paying the unrelated business income tax.<br />***<br />In June, the Romney campaign announced that if he&#8217;s elected, the candidate would move his assets into a federally qualified blind trust, and would also likely sell off any assets that &#8216;are not fully compliant with federal disclosure and other rules applicable to the office of the presidency.&#8217; But if Romney wins, there&#8217;s almost no chance that the underlying assets of his son&#8217;s firm, Solamere, will be revealed.  Solamere could have assets involved in healthcare, energy, telecommunications or any number of other industries, but the public will be left in the dark.<br />***<br /><strong>What is known is that Solamere&#8217;s private equity partners are eager to influence the federal government. </strong> Three of the firms listed in the Solamere prospectus&#8211;Sun Capital Partners, TPG Capital and TA Associates&#8211;are currently financing a lobbying campaign under a trade group called the Private Equity Growth Capital Councill (PEGCC), which is seeking to influence a number of tax and regulatory decisions.  The PEGCC has spent nearly $5.8 million on federal lobbying over the past three years, and untold millions this year on a public relations campaign in swing states to improve the image of private equity&#8211;a strategy seen as designed to benefit Romney&#8217;s campaign. One of the primary concerns of the PEGCC &#8230; is that the carried interest loophole, which allows wealthy investment managers to be taxed [on their compensation for services] at only the 15 percent capital gains rate, may be closed. The group has also &#8230;held meetings with regulators to complain about the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill&#8217;s mandates.<br />***<br />Other Solamere investment partners own businesses that face imminent regulatory action [including SCF partners, Rockwater Energy Solutions, and IPS Canada].<br />***<br />Meanwhile, HIG Capital&#8211;one of the largest Solamere partners, with nearly $10 billion of equity capital&#8211;owns a number of other firms that are closely monitoring the federal government.  One area where private equity firms have made lucrative investments is the new industry of dental management companies that bill Medicaid.  In November 2011, Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Max Baucus of Montana opened an investigation in response to allegations that these corporate-controlled dentists have abused children.<br />***<br />The Medicaid reimbursements for the dental management companies offer a revealing look at <strong>the underlying business model being pursued by the Romney-supporting private equity firms:  big government, when harnessed to industry-friendly regulators, can mean big profits.</strong> Many of these private equity-owned companies rely on federal and state contracts, from HIG Capital&#8217;s Hart Intercivic, a voting machine company, to EnviroFoam Technologies, a biological and chemical decontamination firm that does business with the US military and is owned by Peterson Partners, a private equity firm listed in the Solamere prospectus.<br />***<br />Asked about the rising cost of colleges &#8230;, Romney said that students should take a look at for-profit colleges like Full Sail Uniersity &#8230;. Weeks later&#8230; Romney hailed the &#8216;advent of for-profit institutions of higher learning&#8217; for providing competition with public and private universities.  He again volunteered Full Sail University as a good example of how students can &#8216;hold down the cost of their education.&#8217; <br />What Romney neglected to mention is that <strong>Full Sail University&#8211;in fact the third most expensive college in the United States</strong>&#8211;is owned by TA Associates.  Indeed, TA Associates has viewed the for-profit college industry&#8211;a $40 billion maker where 85 percent of the funds are supplied by taxpayers&#8211;as an excellent opportunity for growth. &#8230;Like most profit driven colleges, which account for only 10 percent of all students but about half of all loan defaults, TA Associates&#8217; schools do not boast a stellar track record.<br />***<br /><strong>&#8216;The fact that Romney praised an overpriced, underperforming college that is owned by his son&#8217;s investment partners, and whose owners have contributed a quarter-million dollars to his campaign and Super PAC, shows how he embodies the corrupting influence of money on politics,&#8217; asserts David Halperin &#8230;. &#8216;It shows how his administration could, as a matter of course, allow special interests&#8211;the interests of his rich friends&#8211;to skew important policy decisions and harm the public interest.&#8217; </strong> Id (emphases added).</p></blockquote>
<p>The article goes on to discuss how closely Solarmere and its investors are intertwined with the Romney campaign.  Tagg is a part of Romney&#8217;s inner circle.  Solamere holds an investor conference that happens to coincide with a neighboring fundraising event for the campaign.  American Crossroads, Karl Rove&#8217;s Super PAC engine of radical GOP ideas, attends both.  The Super PAC can&#8217;t coordinate with campaigns, but the fundraising is hosted by Solamere so that makes it okay, technically. </p>
<p>This excerpt thus amply illustrates the way class warfare really works:  a closely knit group of oligarchs with business ties through their private equity empires and a shared corporatist perspective on society can use insider access to the channels of government power to make government work for them and prevent its working for ordinary folk.</p>
<p>First, money speaks loudly, so legislation tends to get passed that favors the elite or gets blocked when it disfavors their special interests.  Ending the carried interest loophole can&#8217;t make it through Congress, even though there is a wealth of commentary condemning it as an inappropriate subsidy for an industry that is often destructive to the economy.  Hampering the EPA&#8217;s ability to safeguard wildnerness lands or healthy air and water is easily accomplished.  Insider information, influential networks among oligarchs, and intimate acquaintanceship among executives in government and corporate executives ensures the smooth flow and fit of wishlists and accomplishments.</p>
<p>Second, with their focus steadfastly on their own rentier profits from their vulture businesses, oligarchs refuse to support measures that are important for the commonweal, and urge the passage of measures that have harsh impact on ordinary workers.  Offshoring is praised as a &#8220;creative destruction&#8221; even though compensating creative innovation seldom offsets the costs of worker loss, community disintegration, and economic decline.  Unions are viewed as hostile opponents (because the more money that goes to workers in respect of their real work acomplished, the less can be skimmed off the top by vulture capitalists), and hence much of big corporate money is targeted to eliminate collective bargaining rights that protect workers. </p>
<p><em>Note that this is always just one of many blows from private equity&#8217;s leveraged buyout methods, since the use of excess leveraging for quick profits to the private equity managers builds up debt that sucks out cashflow and either provides justification for reduced wages to workers from a barely stable industry or provides justification for a bankruptcy process through which the company&#8217;s pension obligations to its retired workers can more easily be scrapped (even though it could have met them if it had only treated them as important as its payouts to overpaid managers).</em></p>

<div>CINCINNATI, Ohio — Mitt Romney tried Thursday to borrow the campaign themes that got President Barack Obama elected in 2008.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Republican nominee repeatedly promised “big change” in Washington, a fresh phrase for him and one that he used more than a dozen times in a 20-minute speech at a rally that kicked off a day-long Ohio bus tour.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=D4E0C41C-CBB5-4337-96D0-DA57F52C3631">Romney borrows Obama campaign themes</a></i>, James Hohmann, Politico, today,
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Seems to me that Obama should point out <i>what</i> big changes would be in store.  He can start with Medicare and then get into some other highlights of the Ryan budget—and of Romney’s primary-campaign statements, and run ads using clips of Romney saying these things.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>He can then point out that Romney is doing what he’s so good at: writing generic fine print that he can then point to and say, “But this is what I said during the campaign that I would do! Seeee??”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sorta like, it depends on what the meaning of “Let Detroit go bankrupt” means.  Which depends on what the meaning of “managed bankruptcy” is, when you’re suggesting that the government shouldn’t provide GM and Chrysler with money to fund a managed bankruptcy that would <i>not</i> result in liquidation.  Which in turn, I guess, depends on what the meaning of liquidation is.  </p>
<p>Which a very large number of people who are now employed directly or indirectly by those companies would have no trouble defining.

<div>IF General Motors, Ford and Chrysler get the bailout that their chief executives asked for yesterday, you can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye. It won’t go overnight, but its demise will be virtually guaranteed.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">Without that bailout, Detroit will need to drastically restructure itself. With it, the automakers will stay the course — the suicidal course of declining market shares, insurmountable labor and retiree burdens, technology atrophy, product inferiority and never-ending job losses. Detroit needs a turnaround, not a check.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; Mitt Romney, <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/opinion/19romney.html">Let Detroit Go Bankrupt</a></i>, New York Times, Nov. 18, 2008
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The problem for Romney?  That the turnaround that Detroit needed could not have occurred without that check.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The solution for Romney?  Say that he was proposing a “managed bankruptcy” rather than a liquidation bankruptcy, and pretend that those two things are mutually exclusive.  And—<i>voila</i>!—everyone’s focused on whether Romney was or was not proposing a liquidation of GM and Chrysler. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which, of course, he was, because, well, the turnaround that Detroit needed could not have occurred without that check. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But in that op-ed, Romney said—unequivocally—that receipt of that check by the auto companies would spell the <i>demise</i> of the American automotive industry.  He said he could virtually <i>guarantee</i> it.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That’s right, folks.  The man who claims that his business savvy means he will, if elected president, cause the creation of 12 million new American jobs didn’t <i>know</i> that there was no private-sector financing available to <i>fund</i> a non-liquidation managed bankruptcy for these companies.  And, even more important, <i>he thought that federal funding would spell the demise of the automotive industry</i>. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In other words, even more important than that this guy is the Houdini candidate is that, by his own accounting—by his own words in that op-ed—he economics prowess is an apparition.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, it <i>is</i>almost Halloween.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Good thing that guarantee was only virtual.
</p>
</div>

<div>I loved the horses-and-bayonets rejoinder, and I especially loved that it highlighted Romney’s incessant plucking of irrelevant statistics and misrepresenting what they indicate.  But the line I liked best wasn’t any line that Obama said.  It was this one, said by Romney in his closing statement:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’ll lead you in an open and honest way.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>You can start being open and honest <i>now</i>, Governor. You don’t have to wait until you’ve become our leader to be <i>open</i>.  And to be <i>honest</i>.
</p>

<div></div>
<div>Honestly.</div>

<div>Solamere Capital—named after an exclusive neighborhood in Utah where the family had a vacation home—was incorporated in February of 2008, only weeks after the campaign ended. Its first office address was the Romney campaign headquarters in Boston’s North End. One of its first big commitments was $10 million from Ann Romney’s blind trust&#8230; According to a copy of the Solamere prospectus that<em> <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/politics/articles/2011/10/07/mitt_romneys_chief_fund_raiser_built_investment_firm_on_political_network/" target="_blank">The Boston Globe </a></em>obtained, they promised “unique access” to lucrative deals that the partners would land thanks to their “close personal and business relationships.” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/us/politics/ties-to-romney-08-helped-fuel-equity-firm.html?pagewanted=all&#038;_r=0" target="_blank"><em>The New York Times</em></a> reported that the firm ultimately raised money from a variety of Romney donors and fund-raisers, including<em> </em>John Miller, a longtime family friend and former corporate CEO, and Meg Whitman, the former head of eBay.

<div>The Mitt Romney of the second debate, to use Mike Huckabee’s memorable phrase, “looks like the guy who fires you.” He exposed, once again, his biggest fault: that he has no idea what it’s like to be middle-class and struggling in 2012 America.</p>
<p>To take just a couple of examples, here was Romney explaining the benefits of his tax program, the breaks that you’ll get on your stock dividends and mutual funds. As he outlined it with all the mercenary gusto of the visiting suit with a PowerPoint, Romney said, “Every middle-income taxpayer will no longer pay any tax on interest, dividends or capital gains.” And, a bit later, “If you’re getting a statement from a mutual fund or any other kind of investment you have, you don’t have to worry about filing taxes on that.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>No kidding. In Romney’s world, and throughout his own tax return, the money earned from money — as opposed to money earned from working — is the chief source of wealth. And it’s already taxed at a lower rate than middle-income earnings. Getting rid of those taxes altogether does nothing for the warehouse manager, schoolteacher or insurance sales person taking home a salary and being taxed at a full rate for making a living. But it’s great for someone living off mutual fund dividends.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Why hasn’t the media—and the Obama campaign!—been talking about that capital-gains/dividends/interest policy statement of Romney’s?  Isn’t that a <i>very big deal</i>?  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Is Egan the only one who <i>noticed</i> this?  Anyone who <i>matters</i>, I mean?  I was stunned when Romney said that on Tuesday, and assumed that that would play as big news.  When it didn’t, I forgot about it. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Egan reminded me.  And maybe he reminded the Obama campaign, too.  
</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t Obama point this out when he campaigns in, say, Ohio and Wisconsin?</p></div>

<p>Romney&#8217;s &#8220;Binders full of women&#8221; comment<br /><em>editor&#8217;s note:  this is a political commentary and not a tax discussion</em>.</p>
<p>When Romney was asked what he could do about the inequity in women&#8217;s compensation, he didn&#8217;t answer the question.  He tried to turn it to his advantage by telling a story of how he ended up bringing a number of women into his cabinet back in the days when he was a more liberal politician serving as governor of Massachusetts.  He claimed that he wasn&#8217;t pleased that his staff hadn&#8217;t found qualified women for cabinet posts, and that he told them to go shake the trees and find some.  They came back with a binder full of women and he appointed a cabinet with record numbers of women.</p>
<p>So he didn&#8217;t answer what he would do about the pay inequities that exist.  He didn&#8217;t answer what he would do about the hiring inequities that exist, other than what seemed to be a personal claim that he personally ensured that there was an adequate search to establish a deep pool of women cabinet candidates.<br />But as a woman, I was jarred by the comment.  It was as though there really weren&#8217;t any &#8220;qualified&#8221; women but when pushed, he was able to come up with &#8220;binders&#8221; of women that could be appointed anyway and he did.  There was a hint that the women he appointed weren&#8217;t really &#8220;qualified&#8221;.  Or that because he had to push his staff to go out and find them, something else was wrong.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>It turns out that another organization&#8211;the Massachusetts Women&#8217;s Political Caucus&#8211; was thinking ahead and trying to ensure that whomever was elected governor would be aware of the many qualified women who could serve on a cabinet.  It created a Government Appointments Project (MassGAP) that developed an extensive process for candidate consultation on including women in high-level positions and got pre-election commitment from both the Democratic and Republican candidates to make efforts towards that goal. It was binders put together by MassGAP that the governor used to make his appointments.  (Perhaps if organizations in other states had prepared in that way, even more governors would have done better jobs of appointing females to their cabinets.)</p>
<p>Further, the meaty positions that were considered central to the functioning of the state (budget, trade, and similar matters) were indeed handed over to men.  The women were given more peripheral roles.<br />While Romney should receive some recognition for acknowledging that appointment of women was and is the right thing to do, his awkward phrasing nonetheless suggests that he doesn&#8217;t think women are at a par with men in this game of politics, and his avoidance of the heart of the equity question suggests he doesn&#8217;t get it.</p>

<p>Romney&#8217;s Tax (Mis)Calculations: if your two and two don&#8217;t add to four, pretend the Laffer curve gives you more</p>
<p>Anybody watching last night&#8217;s presidential debate surely became aware at some point that Romney&#8217;s so-called &#8220;plan&#8221; for economic growth is an empty shell based on <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766"></a>the idea that he&#8217;s made money for himself so he knows how to run a country. </p>
<p>Romney&#8217;s plan is pure <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_fundamentalism">market fundamentalism</a>&#8211;a mistaken view that the &#8220;market&#8221; will take care of all problems and vigorously grow to elevate everyone&#8217;s livelihood just so long as government regulators stay out of the business of regulating and allow business owners and managers (particularly huge multinational corporate owners and managers) to do whatever they want, including fire workers, outsource business assets, and engage in complex schemes to turn tax laws into tax avoidance bonanzas.  Oh, and the government should provide all kinds of subsidies to aid those businesses at minimal or no (tax) cost&#8211;from interstate roadways to easy rights to exploit national lands owned by the public; from localo fire protection to federally funded international security; from state-based contract protection to federal courts that provide handy forum choices to the wealthy and big corporations; from state and local property tax exemptions and waivers to federal intellectual property rights that provide monopoly power and stifle innovation (exactly the opposite of the Founders&#8217; dream).</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>And when Romney claims that he can &#8220;simplify&#8221; the tax system and lower everyone&#8217;s rates without increasing the deficit, reducing the taxes paid by the upper crust, or increasing the taxes paid by the middle class, while at the same time increasing the military budget and striking more threatening poses a la the Bush neo-cons on Iran?  That&#8217;s gibberish, as many respected studies have shown.</p>
<p>So to his rescue comes one of those propaganda tanks in the guise of an intellectual &#8220;institute&#8221;&#8211;the Institute for Policy Innovation (IPI).  The Institute puts out a &#8220;Tax Bytes&#8221; newsletter/blogpost supporting right-wing, market fundamentalist, Friedman-lite tax policies.  Not surprisingly, the Institute is sanguine about making a Reagan-style across-the-board rate reduction program work even in an economy that is still in transition back from the brink that the Bush market fundamentalist tax and fiscal policies put us in.  That is,  in spite of the fact that Romney-Ryan stand for things like making the Bush tax cuts permanent, eliminating the estate tax, maintaining the preferential rate structure for capital gains and carried interest, and even extending that very low rate preference to all other capital income (like interest) for those earning less than $200,000 (who don&#8217;t have much capital income to worry about though, since the vast majority of it goes to the people in the very top 5% who make millions, not thousands)&#8211;the Institute says &#8220;increased private sector growth&#8221; will make the plan work.  See &#8220;<a href="http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=236713c0eb5508a7a8a8c680e&#038;id=8964e6a996&#038;e=1e32789ab4">Of Course It Can Work</a>&#8220;, IPI, TaxBytes 9.25 (October 17, 2012).  That&#8217;s just the Laffer Curve idea at its worst&#8211;the wacky concept that when you cut taxes, there will be more tax revenues because of all the wonderful things that a self-regulated market does for economies.<br />    <br />So IPI thinks you can cut government revenues even more than Bush did (when the Bush tax cuts of 2001-2003-2004 (and the rest) amounted to about one-third of the cause of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late-2000s_recession">Great Recession</a>).  It buys into the fairy tale that has been used by the far right to justify obstructionist, non-realistic policy positions and that has created the fiscal debacle we are still climbing out of.  That fairy tale is the market fundamentalist &#8220;pie in the sky&#8221; concept that broad economic growth can be magically generated just by letting the rich continue to get richer even if the middle class is falling into poverty and infrastructure is crumbling. </p>

                                <p>
<div>Okay, thus far it’s just one major pundit, the Washington Post’s E.J. Dionne, whose column posted at 1:58 p.m. <i>demolishes</i> the media’s Conventional Wisdom of last night and this morning, which focused mainly on Romney’s two gaffes, and concluded that Obama had won but only barely.  Binders-full-of-women is irresistible fun, but ultimately unimportant; Romney just misspoke, G.W. Bush-style.  And the clarity of Obama’s Rose Garden statement could be debated; it could depend on what the meaning of “is” is.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But now the focus among the punditry will change.  Dionne <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ej-dionne-romney-goes-from-etch-a-sketch-to-sketchy/2012/10/17/ad4edc2e-187a-11e2-9855-71f2b202721b_print.html">captures it</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Any high school debate coach would tell a student that declaring, “Believe me because I said so,” is not an argument. Yet Romney confused biography with specificity and boasting with answering a straightforward inquiry. “Well, of course, they add up,” Romney insisted of his budget numbers. “I — I was — I was someone who ran businesses for 25 years, and balanced the budget. I ran the Olympics and balanced the budget.” Romney was saying: Trust me because I’m an important guy who has done important stuff. He gave his listeners no basis on which to verify the trust he demanded.
</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></div>
<div><a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/decision2012/watch-presidential-debate-live-online-mitt-romney-and-president-obama-at-hofstra-university/2012/10/16/003ef5e2-17d9-11e2-a55c-39408fbe6a4b_story.html">Romney’s stonewalling</a> was so obvious that it opened the way for one of Obama’s most effective lines of the evening: “If somebody came to you, Governor, with a plan that said, here, I want to spend $7 or $8 trillion, and then we’re going to pay for it, but we can’t tell you until maybe after the election how we’re going to do it, you wouldn’t have taken such a sketchy deal. And neither should you, the American people, because the math doesn’t add up.” Obama sought to make that point in the last debate. This time he had a metaphor and a story to go with the arithmetic.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney also covertly disclosed that he, like George W. Bush before him, has every intention of cutting taxes on the rich. Like Bush, he used stealthy language to try to achieve a great fiscal coverup.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here was Romney on Tuesday: “I will not, under any circumstances, reduce the share that’s being paid by the highest-income taxpayers.” Here was <a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=october-3-2000-transcript">Bush in 2000</a>: “After my plan is in place, the wealthiest Americans will pay a higher percentage of taxes [than] they do today.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This really matters: Romney intends, as Bush did, to push for steep tax cuts for the wealthy. His only pledge is that he’ll keep the share of the total tax take paid by the wealthy unchanged, presumably by reducing other taxes too. And this is supposed to lead to lower deficits? How?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The most instructive contrast between Debate I and Debate II was the extent to which Romney’s ideas crumbled at the slightest contact with challenge. Romney and Paul Ryan are <a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/ezra-klein/wp/2012/10/17/in-debate-romney-struggled-on-substance/">erecting a Potemkin village</a> designed to survive only until the polls close on Nov. 6. They cannot say directly that they really believe in slashing taxes on the rich and backing away from so much of what government does because they know that neither idea will sell. So they offer soothing language to the middle class, photo ops at homeless programs to convey compassion and a steady stream of attacks on Obama, aimed at shifting all the attention his way.…
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the first debate, Obama let Romney back into the race by failing to shake his opponent’s self-presentation. But Romney also put himself into contention by pretending to be a moderate, shelving his plutocratic side and hiding his party’s long-term objectives.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In the second debate, the disguise fell. Romney revealed more of himself than he wanted to and asked voters to endorse a radical tax-cutting program without providing them the details that matter. Sketchy is one word for this. Deceptive is another.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney’s candidacy will not survive an ad by the Obama campaign that explains what the meaning of “reduce the share” is.  In actual math.  And that asks voters whether they think Romney intended that they think he meant … something else.
</p>
