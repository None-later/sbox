<div>After expressing sorrow about the deaths, Mr. Romney told reporters on the campaign trail that the Obama administration had tried to appease Islamic extremists who should have been condemned instead. He said a statement issued by the American Embassy in Cairo before the deaths criticizing an anti-Islamic video was “akin to an apology” and a “severe miscalculation.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div itemprop="articleBody">“The first response of the United States must be outrage at the breach of the sovereignty of our nation, and apology for American values is never the right course,” Mr. Romney said, speaking at a campaign stop in Jacksonville, Fla. He added, “They clearly sent mixed messages to the world.”

<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/13/us/politics/attacks-fuel-escalation-in-presidential-race.html?_r=1&#038;hp&#038;pagewanted=all">Embassy Attack Fuels Escalation in U.S. Presidential Race</a></i>, Peter Baker, New York Times, today
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>For the last few days I’d thought that all Obama had to do to wrap up this election was run ads showing clips of Romney’s <a href="http://2012.talkingpointsmemo.com/2012/09/romney-ryan-tax-loopholes.php">bizarre interview</a>on last Sunday’s Meet the Press—e.g., “Well, the specifics [of the tax plan] are these which is those principles I described are the heart of my policy.”—maybe juxtaposed with clips of Romney’s speech to the Detroit Economic Club last February in which he identified some specifics, er, principles.  (Or is it principles, er, specifics?  Hard to tell, with such specific principles.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And I still think that an ad of that sort would do the trick.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But I also now think that a precise, appropriate response by Obama to Romney’s weird statement would effectively end Romney’s election chances.  It is, after all, hard to imagine a more dangerous statement by a president, and therefore by a presidential candidate, than the pronouncement that America’s values—America’s <i>values</i>— include wanting Americans to deliberately offend the world’s Muslims. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney apparently believes that it’s fine to risk American lives overseas (including, presumably, members of our military) by appearing to support such pointlessly offensive provocation.  Obama should point this out, even if the news media doesn’t.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Obama also shouldn’t allow the detachment of those comments by Romney, which indicate pretty starkly that Romney doesn’t understand even the concept of diplomacy, from the implications of those comments in spheres beyond foreign policy and defense.  I’ve wondered for a while now why the Obama campaign hasn’t emphasized more Romney’s persistent habit of drawing conclusions based upon erroneous fact or upon no facts at all. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The very essence of Romney’s candidacy, at least originally, was his claimed cool-headed judgment and problem-solving ability.  Yet time and again he appears unable to accurately or adequately assess basic facts and understand even the most obvious implications of those facts—and of his own statements and conduct.  What has been apparent to me for nearly a year now, and what this incident should now clarify for the general public, is that Romney is not prompted to action—whether in foreign policy, defense, the economy, or anything else—by anything other than immediate opportunism and his adopted ideology.  And that, even worse, he seems unable even to <i>understand</i> the implications of what he says, what he proposes and what he does.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don’t see how his election hopes can survive his comments of yesterday and today.

<div>[A]n unusually high foreign tax credit in 2008 raises questions about the size and source of Mr. Romney’s foreign income that year and how it was treated for tax purposes. </div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; <i><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/25/business/in-romneys-tax-return-clues-in-foreign-taxes.html?pagewanted=all&#038;gwh=2EA44D8EF70AEE179F919EB469FBAC40">Tax Credits Shed Light on Romney</a></i>,* James B. Stewart, New York Times, Aug, 24</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don’t follow finance-industry news very closely, and the only technical knowledge I have about U.S. tax law for foreign income is what I’ve read in the last few months concerning the foreign bank accounts that Romney’s 2010 income tax return shows he had in 2009.  Including his UBS account, which was opened in (if I recall correctly) 2003 and had $3 million in it at the end of 2009.  That account was managed by a trustee, a Boston lawyer and close friend of the Romney’s, who apparently closed the account in 2010; the account doesn’t appear in Romney’s 2011 tax-return estimate. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So it is only because of the controversy surrounding Romney’s tax returns and offshore bank accounts that I even know about the 2009 IRS amnesty program for Americans who evaded U.S. income taxes by hiding income in foreign bank accounts, and that why the program was initiated: UBS, Switzerland’s largest bank had been forced to identify thousands of U.S. citizens who had accounts there, many of whom, the IRS presumed accurately, had used the bank to evade payment of U.S. taxes.  The large number of identified evaders would make it difficult to prosecute them all; thus the temporary amnesty program.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’d wondered how this all had come about so suddenly, but hadn’t bothered to research it.  But I learned <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/news/jailed-banker-helped-crack-swiss-142921849.html">the answer today</a>.  An American-born UBS banker named Bradley Birkenfeld decided in 2007 to try to cash in on a newly-enacted whistleblower statute that would garner him 30% of the taxes that the IRS recouped as a result of the information he provided.  He hoped also to trade his information for immunity from criminal prosecution.  Only the monetary goal succeeded.  He was released last month from prison after serving a more-than-three-year sentence. And he was just awarded $104 million under that whistleblower statute.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>According to Wikipedia, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Birkenfeld">Birkenfeld</a>, who was among UBS employees whose job it was, beginning in 2001, to solicit American customers to use the bank to evade U.S. taxes, pled guilty in June 2008 to a single count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, but he was not sentenced until August 2009.  He spent the intervening 14 months earning the $104 million that he will now be paid, most of it the result of the amnesty program, which reportedly was <i>very</i>successful.  “In February 2009, UBS paid $780 million to resolve a criminal tax avoidance investigation. It also admitted to assisting 17,000 clients evade their taxes through the use of offshore accounts between 2000 and 2007,” Wikipedia says.  “In July 2009, to avoid additional fines, UBS agreed to provide the names of 5,000 Americans who had offshore accounts with UBS.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The New York Times article from which I quote above was published on the Saturday before the start of the Republican convention and best as I can tell received little attention.  So let me give it some.  All with the caveat that I probably don’t know what I’m talking about when I conclude that the information in the article seems to suggest, if I understand it correctly, that in 2008, when the U.S. and European economies were collapsing, Romney suddenly paid a seemingly inexplicable $800,000 in foreign income taxes, “far more than any other year,” as indicated in the 2010 tax returns.  Stewart writes that Romney “reported <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/08/25/business/25stewart-doc.html#document/p1/a69311" title="Related line from Form 1040 of Romney tax return.">more than $800,000 in taxable refunds</a> from 2009, which seems very high.” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Stewart wondered how Romney’s blind trust could have earned such amounts in foreign countries and generated such large tax credits,” and so he consulted to experts,  <a href="https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/profile.cfm?section=bio&#038;personID=20283" title="Professor’s biography on N.Y.U. Web site.">Daniel Shaviro</a>, professor of taxation at New York University School of Law, and <a href="http://web.law.umich.edu/_facultybiopage/facultybiopagenew.asp?id=337" title="Professor’s biography on university Web site.">James R. Hines Jr.</a>, a professor of international taxation at the University of Michigan Law School. “One possibility,” Stewart says, “is that the financial crisis and resulting bleak economic outlook caused Mr. Romney’s trustee to cash in long-held, appreciated foreign assets. Another possibility is that they resulted from some kind of more elaborate tax shelter, or some combination of the two.”  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Might one other possibility be that Romney suddenly paid several years’ back taxes to foreign governments in 2008 or 2009?  After all, although people like me were unaware of the Birkenfeld matter, people like Romney and like the trustee of the Swiss account of course were.  (Is Romney trying to protect the reputation of his friend, the trustee?)

<div>The large foreign tax credit for 2009, Shaviro told Stewart, “has baffled tax experts.”  It “makes no sense to me at all’.” But, Shaviro said, the IRS has challenged many tax-shelter “deals intended to generate foreign tax credits.”  And Hines said, “Lots of people are speculating about the source of this tax credit, but at this point it’s just conjecture.”

<div>Conjecture, yes.  And I’m not even an expert.  But conjecture about this sure is fun.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>
<div>I like <a href="http://truth-out.org/">Truthout</a>.  I’m on its email list and so I receive daily notices about newly posted articles on the site.  I don’t read them all, but the ones I read usually are worth the time.  And I was deeply flattered when, two years ago, on the basis of two lengthy articles I posted here on AB on complicated legal issues, I was invited to blog for them, mainly on legal issues, through a new forum they were at the time planning for a small set of invited bloggers. (The forum never got off the ground, much to my disappointment.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So I suppose that this is, in a sense, a family quarrel.  But earlier today Dan emailed me with a link to a Truthout article and asked my opinion of it, and I obliged.  And hours after I first read the article, I’m still seething enough to repost those comments here.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The article is titled <a href="http://truth-out.org/opinion/item/11264-john-cusack-and-jonathan-turley-on-obamas-constitution"><i>John Cusack Interviews Law Professor Jonathan Turley About Obama Administration’s War On the Constitution</i></a>.  Turley is the Someone and Someone Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington Law School. Good for him.  He’s also the Director of the Environmental Law Advocacy Center there.  And the Executive Director of the Project for Older Prisoners.  <i>Very</i>good for him.  And he’s one of those omnipresent law-prof. presences whose byline is everywhere, or seems to be, and whose quotes also regularly appear in articles under other people’s bylines because, I think, his contact information comes already printed on the Rolodexes of legal-issues journalists when purchased.  This is especially so in recent years, because, as <a href="http://www.law.gwu.edu/Faculty/profile.aspx?id=1738">his GW faculty page</a> says, “[h]e has served as a consultant on homeland security and constitutional issues, and is a frequent witness before the House and Senate on constitutional and statutory issues as well as tort reform legislation.”  <i>Very, very</i> good for him.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It also says, “He also is a nationally recognized legal commentator; he ranked 38th in the top 100 most cited ‘public intellectuals’ in a recent study by Judge Richard Posner and was found to be the second most cited law professor in the country.”  I know. That’s my point.  He’s eminent.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>John Cusack, the article’s actual author and Turley’s interviewer, is, well, a movie star.  Star, being the operative word here.  As it is with Turley himself.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The point of the interview was to elicit Turley’s assertion that it is the obligation of principled liberals to not vote for Obama this time, because of Obama’s stances and actions on Patriot Act and other War on Terror questions and in Afghanistan. Which Cusack did, bracketed and interspersed between Cusack’s own musings on the subject.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hyperventilating after reading the article, I responded to Dan (OK, slightly edited here):
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Wow. I don’t even know where to begin.  I too have been baffled and stunned by the Obama administration’s positions on Patriot Act-related and other War on Terror prisoner civil rights issues. And on some lower-profile civil liberties issues unrelated to war or to Patriot Act matters, too—particularly certain positions as <i>amicus</i> at the Supreme Court, from time to time; cases in which the federal government is not actually a party but in which the Court has asked the Solicitor General’s office to way in anyway, or in which the administration has decided on its own to way in.  And on Afghanistan, well, the situation speaks for itself.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But only liberals like John Cusack and Jonathan Turley—people who can, literally, afford the luxury of putting “principle” above the realities of the effect of Romney/Ryan vs. Obama on so many, many, many <i>other</i> critically important public-policy and legal issues—are anything but <i>insane</i> to engage in the absurd conceit that they are principled in helping elect Romney/Ryan.  Anyone else who takes that &#8220;principled&#8221; stance is crazy.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I know all too well the specifics of the profound harm done by the Federalist Society judges—at <i>all three</i> levels of the federal bench, not just the Supreme Court.  And the courts are only one of so many parts of this.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is, truly, almost <i>nothing</i> that makes me angrier than reading this kind of garbage from people who themselves will never actually be directly impacted by the outcome of this election.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Japan’s kamikaze pilots during WWII were principled, too—or at least <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideki_T%C5%8Dj%C5%8D">their prime minister</a> and military commanders were. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>To people of that ilk, I say: Drop dead.  Or vote for Ralph Nader.  And then drop dead.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Romney campaign should have put Cusack on that stage last Thursday instead of Clint Eastwood.
</p>

                                <h3>The Federal Bailout That Saved Bain Capital &#038; Mitt Romney</h3>
<blockquote><p>Government documents prove the candidate&#8217;s mythology is just that</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>by: <strong>Tim Dickinson</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote><strong></strong>Mitt Romney likes to say he won&#8217;t &#8220;apologize&#8221; for his success in business. But what he never says is &#8220;thank you&#8221; – to the American people – for the federal bailout of Bain &#038; Company that made so much of his outsize wealth possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>In fact, government documents on the bailout obtained by <em>Rolling Stone</em> show that the legend crafted by Romney is basically a lie. The federal records, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, reveal that Romney&#8217;s initial rescue attempt at Bain &#038; Company was actually a disaster – leaving the firm so financially strapped that it had &#8220;no value as a going concern.&#8221; Even worse, the federal bailout ultimately engineered by Romney screwed the FDIC – the bank insurance system backed by taxpayers – out of at least $10 million. And in an added insult, Romney rewarded top executives at Bain with hefty bonuses at the very moment that he was demanding his handout from the feds.<br />…<br />Under normal circumstances, such ample reserves would have made liquidating Bain an attractive option: Creditors could simply divvy up the stockpiled cash and be done with the troubled firm.<br />…<br />What&#8217;s more, the bonus loophole gave Romney a perverse form of leverage: If the banks and the FDIC didn&#8217;t give in to his demands and forgive much of Bain&#8217;s debts, Romney would raid the firm&#8217;s coffers, pushing it into the very bankruptcy that the loan agreement had been intended to avert. The losers in this game would not only be Bain&#8217;s creditors – including the federal government – but the firm&#8217;s nearly 1,000 employees worldwide.<br />…<br />The FDIC considered finding a buyer to take over its loans to Bain, but analysts concluded that &#8220;Bain has no value as a going concern.&#8221; And the government wasn&#8217;t likely to get much out of Bain if it allowed the firm to go bankrupt:<br />…<br />How had Romney scored such a favorable deal at the FDIC&#8217;s expense? It didn&#8217;t hurt that he had close ties to the agency – the kind of &#8220;crony capitalism&#8221; he now decries. A month before he closed the 1991 loan agreement, Romney promoted a former FDIC bank examiner to become a senior executive at Bain. He also had pull at the top: FDIC chairman Bill Seidman, who had served as finance chair for Romney&#8217;s father when he ran for president in 1968.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The federal documents also reveal that, contrary to Romney&#8217;s claim that he returned full time to Bain Capital in 1992, he remained involved in bailout negotiations to the very end….</p></blockquote>

<div>Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney escalated his attacks on President Barack Obama&#8217;s welfare waivers Monday, suggesting that welfare recipients make up President Barack Obama&#8217;s political &#8220;base.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In an <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-08-26/romney-interview-campaign/57331498/1?loc=interstitialskip" target="_hplink">interview with <em>USA Today</em></a>, Romney defended his much-criticized <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/20/mitt-romney-welfare-ad_n_1810134.html" target="_hplink">ads</a>, which falsely accuse the president of removing the work requirement in welfare. He insisted that the spots were accurate and that Obama had pursued his policy as part of an electoral calculation.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;There&#8217;s no question in my mind that the president&#8217;s action was calculated to&#8230; shore up his base,&#8221; Romney said, according to an extended quote that <em>USA Today</em> provided to The Huffington Post. &#8220;Weakening the work requirement in welfare is an enormous mistake.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/27/mitt-romney-welfare-waivers_n_1832871.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular">Mitt Romney Suggests Obama Welfare Waivers Are A Tactic To &#8216;Shore UpHis Base&#8217;</a>, Luke Johnson, Sam Stein, Huffington Post, today
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Two current Republican governors support Obama’s reelection?  Wow. That’s a very big political story! And apparently it&#8217;s true!  Since two of the five governors who requested the waiver that Obama granted in order to fire up his base are Republicans (presumably expecting that Obama would grant the waiver requests in order to fire his base), those two Republican governors must be in cahoots with Obama. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And since virtually no one—members of Obama’s now-fired-up base, included—even <i>knew </i>of the waiver requests and the waiver grants until the Romney campaign made sure they and everyone else (including Romney’s base) did, it seems that the Romney campaign also wants to fire up Obama’s base.  Not to mention their own.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Didn&#8217;t know that Obama&#8217;s &#8220;base,&#8221; er, base, had been clamoring for welfare waivers. Then again, I didn&#8217;t know that Utah&#8217;s and Nevada&#8217;s Republican governors were part of that base.  I mean, who knew?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Oh, brother.

                                <div>In poker a “tell” is the physical giveaway or tic that lets you know someone is lying about his or her hand. In politics it’s the mode of evasion a politician chooses to sidestep a truth he or she doesn’t want to admit or to avoid saying something against self-interest. In his debut interview with <a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/fox-news-brit-hume-praised-on-msnbc-for-exposing-paul-ryans-medicare-lie/">Fox News’ Brit Hume</a> Tuesday, Rep. Paul Ryan’s “tells” were audacious and revealing. They suggest an opening Democrats would be wise to pursue.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ryan (R-Wis.) tried to cloak himself in his supposedly charming “wonky-ness” to sidestep two simple questions from Hume: When does Mitt Romney’s budget reach balance, and when does Ryan’s own budget plan do the same? Ryan pirouetted because Hume’s queries threatened to expose his famed “fiscal conservatism” as a fraud.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It’s worth parsing Ryan’s tactics in this exchange because it shows the brand of disingenuousness we’re dealing with. So let’s go to the videotape. Have a look at the relevant two-minute portion of the clip (<a data-xslt="_http" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/15/politics/ryan-budget/index.html">excerpted on this CNN video</a>) and then we’ll dissect it.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Okay, you’re back. Hume started with <a data-xslt="_http" href="http://video.foxnews.com/v/1785458730001/paul-ryan-on-medicare-budget-plan-relationship-with-romney">a simple question</a>: “The budget plan that you’re now supporting would get to balance when?”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, for context, recall that in the last era of epic budget smackdowns, 1995 and 1996, Newt Gingrich would have had an equally simple answer: in seven years. President Bill Clinton’s failure to embrace the goal of a balanced budget at all was a major political liability that Clinton finally (and shrewdly) erased when he came out with his own 10-year plan in mid-1995. (It’s worth underscoring that a 10-year path to balance was viewed then as the outer limit of credibility — pledging to end the red ink any further than a decade out didn’t pass the laugh test.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Since Ryan knows that Romney’s bare sketch of a plan never reaches balance, he stumbles momentarily before trying to move the conversation to his comfortable talking points about Romney’s goal of reducing spending to historic norms as a share of gross domestic product.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Hume grows quietly impatient. He practically cuts Ryan off.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“I get that,” Hume says. “But what about balance?”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>You can see Ryan flinch. He doesn’t know, he says. Why not? “I don’t want to get wonky on you,” he says, recovering, “because we haven’t run the numbers on that specific plan.” But that’s not “getting wonky” at all. As common sense (and the Gingrich/Clinton approach) suggests, there’s nothing arcane about this subject. You decide on a sensible path to balance as a goal and come up with policies that achieve it. All this means is that Romney hasn’t done what a fiscally conservative leader would do. Trying to evade this as a matter of not “getting wonky” is Ryan’s tell. He’s betting Hume is too dumb, uninterested or short on time to press the point.

</div>
<div></div>
<div>Wow.  Okay.  That’s a much longer excerpt from someone else’s piece than I like to use, unbroken by my own commentary.  And it doesn’t even include the real <i>coup de grace</i> of that column, the best I’ve read in a really long time.  The column goes on recite further details of that interview:  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“Your own budget . . . when does that contemplate reaching balance?” Hume asks.
</p>
</div>
<div>There’s no exit. Not until the 2030s, Ryan finally admits, looking uncomfortable — but then he quickly adds, making a face, that’s only under the Congressional Budget Office’s scoring rules, implying that they’re silly constraints every Fox News viewer would agree are ridiculous (instead of sensible rules meant to credit politicians only for policy proposals that are real). Ryan adds that “we believe” if we get the economy growing, “it would balance in 10 years.” But that’s supply-side faith-based budgeting again — exactly what we ran an empirical test on in the 1980s. (And the truth is, if Ryan’s big tax cuts were properly accounted for, his plan’s real date of balance would push well beyond 2040).
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And finally that promised <i>coup de grace</i>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Why am I <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/matt-miller-the-talented-mr-ryan/2012/08/12/1afaaaa2-e4ad-11e1-936a-b801f1abab19_story.html">harping</a> on this? Because it’s impossible to overstate how central the unjustified label of “fiscal conservative” is to the Ryan brand and the GOP’s strategy. As Clinton understood in the 1990s, “fiscal responsibility” is a values issue important to the voters who decide modern presidential elections.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The point: Democrats can’t afford to let Ryan/Romney’s phony image as superior fiscal stewards survive. And Hume’s interview shows how swiftly this charade can be exposed if Democrats and the press zero in on simple questions like Hume’s. If the press is primed to cover this more intelligently, such queries will also expose the big Republican lie — the idea that you can balance the budget as the baby boomers age without taxes rising.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let me be clear. The most important issue facing the country isn’t when we’re going to balance the budget. It’s how to get growth and jobs reignited in the near term and how to renew the country’s promise and competitiveness after that (an agenda in which long-term budget sanity is just the ante). But if Democrats spend all their energy on Medicare — and don’t knock out the GOP ticket’s undeserved reputation for fiscal responsibility — they’ll find themselves in unexpected peril as the race heads to the fall.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/08/individualism-vs-collectivism-thanks.html">a lengthypost I wrote on Wednesday</a> I expressed my own fear of the danger to Obama and the other Democrats of an all-Medicare-all-the-time campaign focus, because it removes the emphasis on the dramatic income tax reductions for the wealthy and therefore on the radical reduction of tax revenue—which, among other things, <i>surely would require a substantial reduction in Medicare benefits to current and imminent beneficiaries, despite Romney/Ryan’s protestations to the contrary</i>. Here’s how I ended that Wednesday post:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>A lot of eyebrows were raised on Sunday when Ryan, sitting next to Romney in an interview, told Bob Schieffer that he wants to end the tax breaks that apply only to the wealthy.  That’s nice, but of no effect.  A seminal part of his tax-and-budget plan, passed this year by the House, is the elimination of <i>all</i> income taxes on capital gains and dividends.  And although this would mean that many very wealthy people will pay no income taxes or estate taxes, and many other very wealthy people would pay income taxes at a single-digit rate, the elimination of these taxes would apply as well to the non-wealthy who have a capital gain or receive stock dividends, however small.  And so—voila!—Ryan’s statement, made with such earnestness, does not apply to the issue of taxes on capital gains and dividends.  Nor, for that matter, to estate taxes, which his plan entirely eliminates; some non-wealthy people leave small estates, after all.  And semantics is the name of their game, the objective of which is the enabling of ever more vast accumulations of wealth, utterly unfettered by tax obligations.  Pure and simple.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My big fear about the all-Medicare-all-the-time campaign that began last weekend with Romney’s Ryan announcement is that it allows Romney and Ryan to claim the mantle of straight talkers about what they warn is a Medicare-caused fiscal calamity that awaits.  They have yet to explain why, if they fear such a calamity, they propose to reduce federal revenue by trillions of dollars, through their tax-elimination-on-the-wealthy plan.  And when they stress, as they do again and again, that their destroy-Medicare-in-order-to-save-it plan will not end the current program for its current or relatively-imminent recipients (those who are 55 or older), maybe they’ll deign to reveal what programs will be eliminated in order to pay for Medicare for current recipients and baby boomers <i>and</i>—<i>and</i>—the trillions-of-dollars tax cuts for the wealthy.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>My suggestion: Hurricane disaster relief for the southern Atlantic and Gulf Coast states, which will vote for this ticket <i>en force</i>, and crop insurance and drought disaster relief for the plains states, which will vote for them and their budget plan in almost as large percentages. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In 2005, Ryan now-famously advised his audience when he addressed an Ayn Rand fan club that they should make no mistake: current politics is a clash between “individualism” and “collectivism.”  And indeed it is.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, let’s ensure that the public knows the specifics.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>After all, for all the indignant denials Romney has made about Harry Reid’s allegation that Romney paid no income taxes for a period of at least 10 consecutive years, Ryan’s plan—the plan being the one that Romney adopted all the way back last winter, during the primary season; the drafter being the person whom Romney has chosen to be a heartbeat away from the actual presidency has made —would enable Romney to openly pay no taxes on most of his income for the next ten years and beyond.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And about Medicare anyway: Isn&#8217;t it a collectivist program?
</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />UPDATE: Turns out, I’m <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/15/1120420/-Paul-Ryan-admits-We-haven-t-run-the-numbers-on-Romney-Ryan-budget-plan-but-trust-him-it-s-great">very late</a> to <a href="http://www.dailykos.com/story/2012/08/16/1120893/-That-wonky-whacky-Ryan">this party</a>.  How could this not have gotten <i>a lot</i> of media attention earlier?

<div>&#8230; And when, exactly, <i>did </i>he pay that at-least-13% per year?  Might some of it have been paid under the 2009 IRS amnesty plan for people who’d been hiding money in secret overseas bank accounts, after the Swiss banks suddenly agreed to reveal to the IRS the identities of American account holders?

<div>Sooo, Governor, about those <i>massive</i> tax cuts for the wealthy ….  You know, including the elimination of all incomes taxes on capital gains and stock dividends, which your running mate’s budget proposal includes?  <i>How</i>, exactly, do you plan to balance the budget despite that loss of revenue?
</p>

<div>No, no, no.  I mean, how, <i>exactly</i>, do you plan to do that?

<p>Romney&#8217;s Private Equity Magic Trick&#8211;equity manager&#8217;s gain, taxpayers&#8217; losses (Reich Video)</p>
<p>Mitt Romney claims that his business experience at Bain Capital is a superb qualification for the presidency.  He implies that this experience will carry over to his economic policies, with the suggestion that he will become a &#8220;job creator-in-chief&#8221; like all those one-percenters purportedly are in the private sector.<br />In reality, private equity experience is a recipe for disaster in the White House.  Think about what private equity firms do.  They take an ongoing business&#8211;usually one that is making decent profits and paying its workers decently&#8211;and they make it into one that can pay outsized &#8220;rent&#8221; profits to the private equity firm.  Usually, though not always, this means cutting costs and adding debt. </p>
<p>The debt is an elixir for private equity firms.  Because interest is deductible, it actually increases profits by lowering the company&#8217;s federal income taxes; yet because it isn&#8217;t required to be used by the firm to actually improve the products or services offered, it is often used instead to pay dividends to the private equity firms, paying off whatever actual investment the private equity firm made in the company. </p>
<p>Cutting costs is the way for private equity firms to extract even more gravy from their target company.  Cost cutting is most often directed at</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<ul>
<li>firing workers and making fewer workers do the same work that more workers used to do (that&#8217;s called a &#8220;productivity&#8221; gain, garnered, of course, by the private equity firm and not by the everyday workers), and/or </li>
<li>outsourcing jobs to other countries so that labor can be paid less than a going wage in this country (that&#8217;s often coupled with step one, since workers are no longer needed in this country&#8211;sometimes the US workers are even required to train their cheaper foreign counterparts before they are let go, and of course those &#8220;effiencicy&#8221; gains are garnered by the private equity firm and not by the remaining workers), and/or </li>
<li>cutting wages and benefits for the remaining workers (and shipping those extra &#8220;savings&#8221; out as dividends to the equity firm investors), and/or </li>
<li>innovating better administrative systems (this can be a good deal&#8211;for example, putting money  that the company didn&#8217;t have until the new &#8220;investors&#8221; came in into digital record systems or improved communications systems, but it can also be a bad deal, if the firm uses its new technology to game the federal system on taxes, or Medicare reimbursements, or federal contracting or similar items)
<ul>
<li>Consider the fact that Bain and other private equity firms purchased a for-profit hospital.  One of the &#8220;improvements was to redesign the coding system for patient services to increase the reimbursements from Medicare and thus hike up the hospital system&#8217;s profits, which are garnered by the private equity firm.  Julie Creswell and Reed Adelson, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/business/hca-giant-hospital-chain-creates-a-windfall-for-private-equity.html">A Giant Hospital Chain is Blazing a Profit Trail</a>, New York Times (Aug. 15, 2012), at A1 (noting that Medicare reimbursements for the highest classifications surged to $949,000 in 2010 from $48,000 in 2006 at one hospital, in a story about Bain Capital and other equity firms&#8217;  profit improvements at HCA, where nurses and doctors express concerns about profit-making that is driving decisions that shortchange patients through understaffing and/or shortchange the government, as in the new coding system that caused the Medicare reimbursements to skyrocket); see also Steve Denning,<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/stevedenning/2012/08/15/private-equity-wont-fix-health-care-either/">HCA: The unsustainable private equity bubble in US health care</a>, Forbes (Aug. 15, 2012). </li>
<li>As one commenter on the NY Times article noted, &#8220;To be more profitable as a healthcare facility requires &#8230; having more sick people to treat, or hav[ing] higher charges.  Both are inhumane.&#8221;  Munz, New York, NY.  And as one former HCA employee commented, &#8220;patient safety and medication safety came in a distant 2nd to conformity and [the] draconian measures to make care more efficient.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These kinds of activities go hand in hand with the increasing consolidation into mega-business enterprises (regrettably aided by the tax code&#8217;s &#8220;tax-free reorganization&#8221; provisions, that were also made much more flexible during the Bush years in order to facilitate such consolidations).  Big businesses reap the productivity gains of their workers for the few managers and significant shareholders at the top, and either buy  or compete with local and family-owned small enterprises to put those smaller and shallower-pocketed (and less well-connected) business out of the way, thus separating more and more businesses from the communities in which they are located.  All in all, not good for America, and not the kind of skills one wants in the presidency, where we need someone who can see the relationship between the stability of small businesses, viable communities, and stable workers.</p>
<p>For a clear and understandable demonstration of the way private equity firms make their money and who wins (and who loses) from those methods, see Robert Reich&#8217;s video chat on the subject:</p>
