<div>Here’s an exchange between Tim Worstall and me in the comments to my post below titled “<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/10/spain-please-mr-obama-talk-about-spain.html">Spain. Please,Mr. Obama, talk about Spain. Please.</a>”:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>WORSTALL: If you&#8217;re going to comment on the Spanish economy might help if you knew something about it.</p>
<p>The big three banks, the equivalent of the Wall Street ones? They&#8217;re just fine. </p>
<p>Know which part of he banking system screwed up? The Main Street one. The one that was run not for profit (the cajas were not for profits, usually owned by a charitable foundation). Run by the local politicians in fact. The community organisers you might say.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the part of the Spanish banking system that is hopelessly bust. Not a single piece of deregulation in sight. No CDOs, no CDS, no nothing except too many loans out to people who cannot repay.</p>
<p>This may be many things but a rerun of Wall Street in the 90s and 00s it ain&#8217;t.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>ME:  Hmm, Tim.  Did you say in your comment that the percentage of the Spanish economy that is spent on government has even the slightest thing at all to do with the economic situation in Spain?  Was that in code language somewhere in what you said?  If so, I didn’t pick it up.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, if there was no a single piece of deregulation in sight—No CDOs, no CDS, no nothing except too many loans out to people who cannot repay—then maybe it’s that there wasn’t enough regulation of the banking system, to begin with?  And I’m sorta wondering what the difference in outcome was between a bank controlled by pols who screwed up (in Spain) and pols controlled by a banking system (here)?  And, y’know, what all it has to do with the percentage of the economy that is spent on government—which is what Romney claims.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Conflation and non sequiturs, thy name is Mitt Romney.  Remove the incessant conflations and non sequiturs, and what do you have, Tim?  Do tell.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Do tell.

</p>

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Romney doesn’t want to go down the path to Spain?  Oh?  Well, since, actually, the percent of Spain’s total economy that they spend on government has nothing at all to do with Spain’s situation now, and instead has <i>everything</i>to do with the fact that they had a huge, huge housing bubble, worse even than ours, and since their housing bubble is—like ours—the main cause of their economic problems, and since Romney wants to repeal the Dodd-Frank Wall Street and Mortgage-lending regulations and replace them with regulations that favor Wall Street … then, yes, Romney does want to go down the path of Spain. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or at least down the path we took during our deregulation juggernaut.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>OK, here’s the thing: Romney and his campaign aides recognized that that debate forum would present a <i>perfect</i> opportunity for him to just rattle off statements without any challenge.  Just a steady stream of nonsense, without any real risk of being confronted with actual challenges to any of it.  They knew, as I did, that Lehrer—I still remember his nauseating role in the first Bush/Gore debate in 2000—does nothing but ask the candidates to state their positions on whatever.  Open-ended questions in which each one is supposed to state his policy proposal on, say, taxes, or “jobs.” There’s no actual questioning <i>about</i> the proposal.  None.  None.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, Romney gets to state, <i>free and clear</i>, a completely false inference of fact about the cause of Spain’s economic problems.  And he gets to say, <i>free and clear</i>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That’s how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you’ll never get there. You’ll never balance the budget by raising taxes.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Really?  You’ll never balance the budget by raising taxes?  Oh? Didn’t we do exactly that during the Clinton administration?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, the revenue he gets is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes?  Oh? Through the same policies as George W. Bush did?  Really?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And so forth. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Like, that Romney is going to cut tax rates <i>across the board</i> by 20%.  But he’s not going to lower tax revenue from the wealthy at all.  And so forth.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>What Obama needs to do—really, really <i>needs</i> to do—is put up a series of ads juxtaposing Romney’s earlier statements with his gibberish from last night. (I strongly urge using a clip from Romney’s speech to the Detroit Economic Club in February, and a similar speech that same week in Arizona; Michigan and Arizona had their primaries on the same Tuesday.)  But rather than just suggesting that Romney is a slippery liar who’s trying to trick voters into putting into office a team that would put in place drastic, basic changes that he knows a substantial majority of the public <i>doesn’t want</i>, Obama should pretend that Romney just doesn’t know the facts and can’t do simple math.  He is, in other words, not very smart, or at least not very well-informed. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The public, of course, will recognize that Romney’s a sleaze bucket. But Obama can just say, for example, that if Romney doesn’t know that during the Clinton years, we had a balanced budget, he’s too ill-informed to be president.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, about that Spain thing: The final debate will be about foreign policy.  Which, Obama should point out, requires some knowledge of such things as what <i>actually</i>caused Spain’s economy to crash. And then he should educate the public about it.  He can do that in two or three sentences of medium length.  If he wants to see how it&#8217;s done, he can read any one of several Paul Krugman columns in which Krugman did exactly that.  It’s not rocket science.  It’s not even economic science.  It’s simple, established fact.  Of exactly the sort that not long ago Romney’s pollster said the Romney campaign wouldn’t trouble itself about, and that it would instead continue to make up its own facts.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Speaking of good way for the Obama campaign to get a message across in an ad ….
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The bottom line: Obama can easily turn Romney’s performance last night into a plus. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Easily.  Really.

<p>Romney Tax Plan as Budget Busting as Ever</p>
<p>Seriously, I could just re-post my <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/02/romney-tax-plan-blows-hole-in-budget.html">February 27th post</a> word for word tonight and it would be just as true as it was then. The Romney tax plan blows a $5 trillion hole in the budget via tax reductions and he still hasn&#8217;t told us anything about the tax breaks he would get rid of to pay for it, which he has to do because he calls it revenue neutral, as he did again in tonight&#8217;s debate.<br />    <br />Amazingly, Romney kept denying that his tax reductions reduce revenue by $5 trillion over 10 years <i>when considered by themselves</i>, even accusing the President of lying about it! He kept insisting that his plan was revenue neutral and that he would not adopt a plan that would reduce the share of taxes paid by the rich. Trust him. We have his word on it.* (Apparently, that is how <a href="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/2012/10/cnns_factcheck_for_the_ages.php?ref=fpblg">CNN does fact-checking</a>.).</p>
<p>Given his insistence on his proposal&#8217;s revenue neutrality, let me repeat <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/10/how-to-read-republican-tax-proposal.html">my 5-step plan</a>, &#8220;How to Read a Republican Tax Proposal.&#8221;<br />    <br />Step 1: Assume revenue neutrality.</p>
<p>Step 2: Look at what income is no longer taxed.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />In the Romney plan, according to conservative economist <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshbarro/2012/02/22/quick-thoughts-on-the-romney-tax-plan/">Josh Barro</a>, there is a $1 trillion reduction in corporate income tax, $3 trillion from the 20% reduction in tax rates (again, not 20 percentage points: the top rate falls from 35% to 28%), and $1 trillion from miscellaneous tax reductions, notably abolishing the Alternative Minimum Tax.<br />    <br />Step 3: Determine how much of that income you have.<br />    <br />Step 4: Ask what taxes have to be raised to get to revenue neutrality.<br />     <br />Step 5: Look in the mirror to see who pays them.<br />    <br />That would be the end of the story, except that the Romney budget is also raising military spending by $2 trillion, as the President pointed out in the debate. So that has to be offset, too.<br />    <br />Again, the bottom line is that if we cut taxes for the wealthy and corporations, it will impact the budget elsewhere, in some combination of tax increases on the middle class, program cuts, and deficit increases. Regardless of the spin surrounding it, if a proposal reduces some taxes but doesn&#8217;t reduce your taxes, you will lose out via these three methods of compensating for the lost revenue.<br />    <br />* If you aren&#8217;t old enough to remember, this is a reference to a great series of Isuzu car and truck ads featuring &#8220;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Isuzu">Joe Isuzu</a>,&#8221; whose signature line was &#8220;You have my word on it.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>
<div>Yup. All those farmers in Iowa and Nebraska who’ve been waiting for the Farm Bill to pass are as nervous tonight as Richard Nixo … er … Mitt Romney was this evening during the debate, but their problem is different than his was.  Instead of babbling incoherently while wearing a frozen, glassy-eyed smile, the farmers are spending the night tossing and turning while trying to figure out whether the program that they rely on so much is much is worth borrowing from China for. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Maybe tomorrow they can put in a call about that to Ohio senator and Romney “surrogate” Rob Portman, and ask him.  Portman, according to a very serious-faced CBS reporter Jan Crawford (of Clarence-Thomas-is-an-intellectual-leader book fame), told her immediately after the debate ended that Romney we’ll be “repeating” the “specifics” of his economic plan throughout the next five weeks.  Just as he did tonight!  Oh, and be just as confident in his manner as he was tonight!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As a Democrat, I surely hope so.  And once those farmers find out, specifically, whether the Farm Bill subsidies are worth our borrowing from China for them, the can call Portman back and verify that massive tax cuts for the wealthy are worth borrowing from China for. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Seriously … do these folks really think that if they call this stuff “specifics,” people will think that Romney’s incoherent gibberish included specifics and they (the viewers) just sorta <i>missed</i> them?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And seriously … at least Richard Nixon was coherent.  I’ve seen the black-and-white clips of parts of that first 1960 debate.  Yes, he was obviously nervous.  But he was coherent.  And specific.  As the dictionary defines that word, not as Sen. Portman defines it.

<p>Mitt Romney&#8217;s Unintentionally Hilarious Tax Return FAQ</p>
<p> Unless you&#8217;ve been in a coma, you have certainly heard about Mitt Romney&#8217;s release of his 2011 tax returns last Friday. You no doubt know that he and his wife did <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/election/2012/09/21/890451/by-romneys-own-standard-his-tax-returns-would-disqualify-him-from-the-presidency/">not claim all the charitable tax deductions</a> they were due, so their tax rate would not go below 13% of adjusted gross income. If you read <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/mitt-romney-paid-14-1-federal-tax-rate-in-2011-campaign-says.html">Bloomberg</a> or a newspaper that picked up the Bloomberg story, you know that Rafalca, the Romneys&#8217; dressage horse, has disappeared from their 2011 tax deductions. This, of course, raises the question of whether it was a legitimate deduction in 2010 (or earlier?). After all, being in the Olympics probably raised <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2012/07/19/both-left-and-right-got-the-taxes-on-the-romneys-olympic-horse-wrong/">the mare&#8217;s</a> value, making the profit motive necessary for an allowable business deduction more plausible. So why would Rafalca not be eligible to deduct in 2011 if she were eligible in 2010 and probably gained value?    </p>
<p>But have you read the <a href="http://www.mittromney.com/frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page the Romney campaign put up about the 2011 returns and the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) summary of the Romneys&#8217; 1990-2009 taxes? You should, for the humor value, if nothing else.</p>
<p>In question 9, we learn how PwC calculated the average effective tax rate: they added the tax rate for each year, then divided by 20. This tells us almost nothing, as many observers (here&#8217;s <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/expert-romney-may-have-paid-less-in-taxes-over-20-years-than-it-appears/2012/09/21/41b27e00-041e-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_blog.html">one</a>, h/t Think Progress) have pointed out: $50 million taxed at 10% (though <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-21/mitt-romney-paid-14-1-federal-tax-rate-in-2011-campaign-says.html">the campaign claims</a> it was never less than 13.7%) and $5 million taxed at 30% would yield an average tax rate of 20%, using the PwC method, when the true tax rate would be 11.8% ($6.5/$55) in this example.    </p>
<p>In the very next question, however, we learn that for the total of federal taxes, state taxes, and charitable contributions (38.49%), PwC used the proper averaging methodology! In other words, adding up all the payment dollars and dividing by the total adjusted gross income (though we don&#8217;t know what tricks he used before adjusted gross income). Why didn&#8217;t they do that for tax alone?    </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>In 2011, the Romneys&#8217; charitable contributions came to just over twice their federal income tax ($4 million vs. $1.9 million). If that ratio applied for the entire 1990-2009 period, that would make the federal tax portion less than 13% (even lower because I have ignored state taxes). Of course, we have no way of knowing the real rate for federal or state taxes, or charitable deductions, without seeing the actual tax returns.    <br />But wait, there&#8217;s more! Don&#8217;t forget all the offshore accounts! To do this question and answer justice, I&#8217;ll have to quote it in full:    </p>
<p>12. There are some investments that seem to be established in offshore accounts, like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. Are these investments evading taxes?    <br />Note the misdirection in the question, &#8220;evading&#8221; rather than &#8220;avoiding&#8221; taxes, which describe illegal and legal maneuvers respectively. Few people think Romney has broken the law, though <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/08/investigating-mitt-romney-offshore-accounts">Nicholas Shaxson</a> considers it to be a possibility.    </p>
<p>No, the investments by the blind trusts in funds established in the Cayman Islands or other jurisdictions are taxed in the very same way they would be if the shares were held in the US rather than through a Cayman fund. No taxes are evaded or reduced. These funds are all registered with the IRS and report all income to investors and the IRS, just like domestic funds. Whether in Bermuda or Boston or elsewhere, there is no difference in how they are taxed.</p>
<p> If this were true, why would the funds need to be organized in the Cayman Islands? Boston would be a lot more convenient. No, as <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/01/romneys-cayman-explanations-dont-tell.html">Richard Murphy</a> of Tax Research UK told me, these funds are set up to allow round tripping by U.S. investors to avoid U.S. taxes, though some foreigners may also take advantage of them. Moreover, if foreigners are exempt from U.S. taxes like the Unrelated Business Income Tax, what need do they have to invest through the Caymans except to avoid taxes at home? Finally, we know from the <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/08/lid-blowing-off-romney-tax-secrecy.html">Gawker revelations</a> that at least two Cayman funds the Romneys invested in created five blocker corporations, which are set up precisely to allow round-tripping by Americans. How can these funds be established in the Cayman Islands, etc., for any reason other than tax avoidance?</p>
<p>In addition, it is important to note that there are no offshore accounts. These are investments in funds that are organized outside the US.</p>
<p> A fund organized in a secrecy jurisdiction like the Caymans, Bermuda, or Luxembourg is offshore by definition. </p>
<p>Further, it is important to note that Governor Romney did not make these investments. Governor and Mrs. Romney&#8217;s assets are managed on a blind basis. They do not control the investment of these assets. The assets are under the control and overall management of an independent trustee.</p>
<p> We&#8217;ve known since 1994 <a href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/2012-presidential-campaign/romney-criticized-kennedy-for-blind-trust-in-1994-senate-debate-video-20120127">what Romney thinks of blind trusts</a>, calling Senator Ted Kennedy&#8217;s &#8220;a ruse.&#8221; </p>
<p>Finally, the trustee did not choose where the investments were located any more than a stockholder in a Fortune 500 company chooses where that company is organized. Only the sponsor of the fund decides where it is organized. That responsibility is totally outside the control of a passive investor like Gov. Romney or the trustee of his blind trust.</p>
<p> And a stockholder can sell his shares. Has trustee Brad Malt never heard of &#8220;divestment&#8221;? I was one of thousands of people active in the late 1970s to get our universities to sell stock in companies doing business in South Africa, the &#8220;divestment movement.&#8221; While we weren&#8217;t very successful at Princeton, students and faculty at many other universities were, and some major local government funds divested from such firms, too, leading companies like Citicorp to end their South African operations. Malt could sell if he wanted to.<br />The bottom line is the &#8220;same as it ever was,&#8221; one tax system for the 1% and another one for the rest of us.</p>

<div>&#8212; Mitt Romney, <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/transcript-david-muir-interview-mitt-romney/story?id=16881787&#038;page=2#.UF3QOo1lSjN">speaking to ABC’s David Muir</a>, July 29, 2012
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sooo … Romney sees no difference between committing a crime—tax evasion—and consciously choosing to not employ every tax dodge conceivably available in order to barely skirt the line of legally. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And he thinks people wouldn’t want a president who chooses not to do the latter.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yikes.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I keep arguing that Obama should take this guy at his word—okay, his words—that he can’t distinguish between apples, oranges and elephants, and regularly conflates two or three obviously distinct facts or concepts.  And that maybe this isn’t really guy to get the economy moving on a faster track, or the guy to make commander in chief.

<div>Between 1990 and 2009, the Romneys’ average annual effective federal tax rate was 20.2 percent, according to [notarized tax return summaries by Romney trustee Brad] Malt. The lowest effective federal personal tax rate they paid in that period was 13.66 percent, he said.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Over the same 20-year period, the couple gave an average of 13.45 percent of their adjusted gross income to charity.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Fred Goldberg, a former commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, said in a statement released by Romney’s campaign that the couple “fully satisfied their responsibilities as taxpayers.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>“These returns reflect the complexity of our tax laws and the types of investment activity that I would anticipate for persons in their circumstances,” Goldberg said in the statement. “There is no indication or suggestion of any tax-motivated or aggressive tax planning activities.”
</p>
</div>

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Fred Goldberg, a former commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service, said in a statement released by Romney’s campaign that the couple fully satisfied their responsibilities as taxpayers?  That’s good to know, but the question remains: <i>When</i>, exactly, did they satisfy their responsibilities as taxpayers for the years preceding the 2009 IRS amnesty program for anonymous holders of Swiss (and other foreign) bank account holders?  Might it have been retroactively, like, maybe, in 2009?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, there is no indication or suggestion of any tax-motivated or aggressive tax planning activities?  That’s good to know, too. But is Goldberg limiting his statement to what Romney revealed in summaries?  Or does Goldberg have privy to the records of the $20 million-to-$102 million IRA account held in a Cayman Islands account?  And to the mysterious fund, or bank account, or whatever, in Bermuda?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Just wondering.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Malt, by the way, was the trustee of the UBS account that was disclosed in the tax return for 2010. The tax return indicated that Malt had closed the account in early 2010.</div>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>
<div>My introduction (so to speak) to Ann Romney came, if I recall correctly, about two years ago, when I read an article (I can’t remember where) that profiled the Romneys in-depth.  The article discussed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitt_Romney_dog_incident">the Seamus matter</a>, and the 2007 Boston Globe article in which the Romneys’ son Tagg revealed the incident to reporter Neil Swidey. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But I had heard about that before; I read Gail Collins’ New York Times column regularly, and have reacted to the incident with as much dismay as she has.  And I had wondered before why Ann hadn’t disabused her husband of the idea that they should put the dog, rather than, say, the luggage or athletic equipment that they also were transporting on the station wagon roof.  And I wondered this again when reading the new detailed profile, which pointed out that during those long trips, Romney refused to stop for bathroom breaks at the request of any of the kids, but would do so at Ann’s request.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In fact, a strong theme of the article is that Ann pretty much calls the shots on family matters. Large and small.  Including, the article said, on the whether to enlarge their home, repeatedly, so that even in their upscale suburb—an older elegant suburb of Boston, which Wikipedia <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belmont,_Massachusetts">says</a> has seen little growth since the 1950s and “is best known for the mansion-filled Belmont Hill neighborhood, although most residents live in more densely settled, low-lying areas around the Hill”—the house now dwarfs nearby ones. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>According to the article, during Romney’s run for governor, some of their neighbors complained publicly about the Romneys’ outside expansion of their home in the older, built-up suburb. Friends of the Romneys had told reporters then that it was Ann who had wanted the expansions.  When asked about it by a reporter, she said that she and her husband wanted the expansions because they wanted their house to be the one where their kids and their friends wanted to spend most of their time.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That’s right.  Ann Romney thought it wouldn’t sufficiently tug at the heartstrings of parents to simply explain that they had five children, close in age and all still at home when the expansions were done, and that they wanted more room for the family.  No, instead, her tin ear told her it was better politically to say they decided to use their larger purchasing power to buy the favor of their kids and their kids’ friends and win the competition for who’s home was most preferred as a hangout.  After all, doesn’t <i>every</i> parent want that?  And so wouldn’t <i>every </i>parent identify with their decision to grow their home in proportion to their huge income?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, yes, to the first question.  And, no, to the second one.  Or at least, no, to the indifference this woman showed to the interests of others—so indifferent that she thought it was a good political move to say what she said.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I thought of that article today when reading comments on another website about the news reports of Ann’s remarks last night in <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2012/09/21/ann_romney_to_gop_critics_stop_it_this_is_hard_.html">a radio interview</a> in Iowa:
</p>
</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>Stop it. This is hard. You want to try it? Get in the ring.  This is hard and, you know, it’s an important thing that we’re doing right now and it’s an important election and it is time for all Americans to realize how significant this election is and how lucky we are to have someone with Mitt’s qualifications and experience and know-how to be able to have the opportunity to run this country.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>One of the commenters mentioned a statement by Ann back in May or June, shortly after her husband had secured the nomination, in which she said, “It’s our turn.”  I remember the statement well—its smugness and, even more than that, its self-absorption.  It’s all about them, apparently, according to her, I remember thinking.  I was surprised at the time that more wasn’t made of the comment, in the media.  But it probably was viewed as a one-off.  And she isn’t the candidate; she’s just the candidate’s wife.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But as more time has passed, and she’s been more prominent in the campaign, here vapidity, shallowness and utter self-absorption seem to me striking—and undeniable.  When she talks about her own (very serious) medical problems, she gives no indication at all that she’s aware that many others have very serious medical problems but no way to buy a horse for therapy.  When she talks about her family’s travails other than her serious medical problems, she lists long, rainy afternoons when her kids grew antsy and noisy in her huge home with so many amenities that the kids and their friends all wanted to spend a lot of time there.  When she talks of her husband’s generosity, with his time and his money, she talks of his kindnesses and generosity toward their friends, extended family members and members of their religious order; she gives no hint that he, or she, has ever had a generous thought toward anyone else. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Chances are, he (if not she) has, but apparently neither of them realizes that kindnesses, love and emotional support, or at least empathy, toward people with whom they can’t quiet identify may be important for someone in high public office to have.  And, conversely, that being, say, a parent who wants the best for her kids at the expense of other parents isn’t a public policy position.  Or at least isn’t one that will endear you to others.  And, for that matter, that being a parent who wants the best for her kids, period, hardly distinguishes you from others, and that it isn’t a public policy position.  I’d say she needs a new schtik, but I don’t think this is a schtik.  I think there’s just nothing more <i>to</i> her.  No discernible depth whatsoever. Unless you count her promise during her convention speech that “this man will not fail!”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>By now, anyone who hasn’t noticed this woman’s vapidity, shallowness and bald cluelessness hasn’t been paying much attention or is just blinded by partisanship. Nor is my view a partisan one. It’s absolutely impossible for me to imagine Cindy McCain, Laura Bush or Barbara Bush (none of whom were political personalities in their own right, as was Elizabeth Dole) making such hollow, shallow comments, much less doing it incessantly, uninterrupted by anything thoughtful.  Then again, those three women had actual brains. And some substance.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don’t begrudge Ann Romney her moments of public frustration and anger.  These last two weeks surely have been an emotional ordeal for her, it’s been a long, long, trying campaign, and she is, after all, just the candidate’s spouse, not the candidate.  And there’s a limit to the snarkiness that I want to employ against the spouse of a candidate.  But after months of trying to like her, then to tolerate her, even if I couldn’t stand her husband, I’ve found it, well, hard.</div>

                                <p>
<div>Earlier this week, before the, um, video-recording news broke, it was reported that Romney planned to bring one of those debt clocks to his campaign rallies.  Hmmm, I thought; Obama should return the favor; he should bring a debt clock to his own rallies. A clock that shows what the debt will be under Romney’s “I’ll cut taxes by 20%, and then I’ll cut them more, and then I’ll …”, as he told the Detroit Economic Club last February. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or maybe Obama should take two debt clocks to his rallies: one showing the likely debt under Romney’s plan, the other showing the projected debt under the Ryan serious-about-debt-reduction plan.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sounds like a (campaign) plan, to me!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But, of course, now that the video-recording news <i>has</i> broken, Republicans are scrambling to figure out how Romney can salvage his campaign.  The solution?  Turn it into a <i>plus</i> by illustrating how unmanageable the debt will become—and how awful it will be for later generations to have to handle—if we don’t get entitlements under control!  Y’know, by reversing the savings in Medicare under Obamacare!  And by reducing by 205, rather than raising to Clinton-G.H.W. Bush levels, income tax rates on people with incomes above $250,000!
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yup.  Conservative Washington Post columnist Robert J. Samuelson* uses <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/robert-j-samuelson-romney-and-the-welfare-state/2012/09/19/14324ce2-0281-11e2-91e7-2962c74e7738_story.html?hpid=z3">his column today</a> to join that chorus.  He urges Romney to turn that video-recording lemon into lemonade by claiming that what he (Romney) really meant when <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/republicans-bad-gets-worse-romney-225708062--election.html">he said</a> he knows “some believe that government should take from some to give to the others,” and that he thinks “that&#8217;s an entirely foreign concept,” was that the 47% of people who make too little money to pay income taxes as the current tax code is structured should be required to pay income taxes in order to negate some of the revenue loss from the 20% reduction in the tax rate for people with incomes above $250,000, some with incomes <i>way</i> above $250,000.  Like Romney.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Er … I mean … he should turn the discussion into one that shows how serious a challenge it will be for younger generations of people who will take personal responsibility for themselves by forgoing, say, college-tuition loans because those loans no longer exist—oh, or by asking their parents to pay the tuition, and then to lend them the money to become entrepreneurs, like Tagg Romney—to pay down that national debt that by then will be trillions of dollars larger, courtesy of the Romney/Ryan income tax reductions.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sounds like a (campaign) plan, to me!  Go for it, Mitt!</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*CORRECTION:  Welllll, commenter rjs informed me that Samuelson is not an economist.  He just sorta masquerades as one.  Ooooops.  Sorry about my gullibility there, folks.</div>
