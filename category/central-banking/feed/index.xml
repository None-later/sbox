				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today&#8217;s FT (front page, below the fold*) declares that <a href="http://www.bis.org/author/mark_carney.htm">Mark Carney</a> &#8220;has been informally approached as a candidate&#8221; to head the Bank of England &#8220;in June next year.&#8221;  He is currently governor of the Bank of Canada.</p>
<p>It would be a good choice.  As the speeches at the link above note, Carney is no fool, which often seems rather more than one can say for many members of David Cameron&#8217;s Administration.**</p>
<p>Of course, the BoE already has one foreigner who should be considered as Merwyn King&#8217;s successorâ€”but <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Posen">Adam Posen is American</a>.  As the FT anonymously notes:<br />
<blockquote>Naming a foreigner as Governor&#8230;would break with tradition, although Mr. Carney has a British wife, studied at Oxford university [sic] and worked at [The Giant Vampire Squid] in London early in his career.</p>
<p>&#8220;As a Canadian national, he is a subject of the Queen,&#8221; said one supporter. &#8220;That is important.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m now waiting for <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon">Felix Salmon</a> to start a &#8220;Posen for the BoE Governorship&#8221; campaign which, sadly, is likely to be about as successful as his &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2012/04/03/does-anybody-at-all-think-kims-a-better-candidate-than-ngozi/">Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala for the World Bank Presidency</a>&#8221; campaign.</p>
<p>*no link&#8211;being a print subscriber, online access is limited to PDFs, and the website is quite unfriendly to non-online subscribers</p>
<p>**Cameron&#8217;s choices remind one that however pathetic Tim Geithner is, it is possible to do worse.  I mean, really, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2012/01/britain-in-the-1930s-and-britain-today.html">George Effing Osborne</a>? A man who supposedly <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Osborne">prepared for five years in the &#8220;Shadow&#8221; role</a> and came up with <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/naa2/quarterly-national-accounts/q4-2011/stb---quarterly-national-accounts-gdp-q4-2011.html#tab-GDP-analysed-by-expenditure-categories--chained-volume-measures--Table-C2">this shite</a>?</p>
