<p> So we thought we had finally created a national system of health insurance that would permit near-universal coverage for essential health benefits to every American. </p>
<p>But the Obama administration says it is not going to write rules regulating exactly what benefits must be covered.  Again bowing his head to the GOP personal responsibility/states&#8217; rights mantras, the president is willing to let states &#8220;experiment&#8221; like they do with Medicaid.  Question whether this amounts to allowing right-wing states to shift benefits to private profits and away from care for Americans?<br />This goes back to the recommendation from a panel at The National Academic of Sciences, which said that the federal government should take cost into consideration in deciding what&#8217;s essential to be provided by health insurance plans under the reform act and that new benefits should be &#8216;offset&#8217; by cost cutting elsewhere. Robert Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/07/us/politics/panel-says-us-should-weigh-cost-in-health-coverage.html">Panel Says U.S. Should Weigh Cost in Deciding &#8216;Essential Health Benefits'&#8221;</a>, New York Times, Oct. 7, 2011, A14.<br />  <br />But a primary problem with cost-benefit analysis as typically understood is that it favors the status quo because any new benefit for which money must be expended will cost compared to the current system, and the benefit is much harder to turn into a quantitative number that will prove that the cost is worth it.  It is very hard to do truly &#8216;dynamic&#8217; cost-benefit analysis&#8211;the assumptions used tend to be a one-size-fits-all and it is hard to calculate the way that the immediate benefit builds even more substantial long-term benefits and then result in much lower costs down the road,</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>so that current costs that will have substantial long-term benefits that may not add up to significant numbers until years or decades have passed will tend to be viewed as negatives, whereas maintaining a terribly ineffective and unjust status quo will be seen as positive.  Even more killing for any cost-benefit analysis of medical reform where part of the reason for the problem is the exorbitant pricing that creates large profits for doctors and for-profit hospitals is that If &#8216;costs&#8217; take into account the fact that decent health care modeling should reduce the highest end medical provider incomes (like the excessive profits made by private nursing homes and hospitals and surgeons who do not work on salary, etc.), then of course the cost-benefit analysis will favor the status quo where those that have money get good care and those that don&#8217;t die.</p>
<p>One of the ways that the failure to adopt at least a public option or ideally a single (national) payer option for health care reform shows is that the panel suggested that the minimum coverage required should conform to what small employers provide&#8211;typically much less generous coverage than that provided by large employers.  As the October New York Times article on this noted, &#8220;This reading of the law was unexpected, but the panel said it was justified because small businesses &#8216;will be among the main customers for policies in the state-based exchanges.'&#8221;  Id.  Not surprisingly, the article also concludes that &#8220;the recommendation is likely to please employers and insurance companies and could cause concern among some advocates for consumers and patients with particular illnesses who want more expansive benefits.&#8221;  Id.  Again&#8211;just more evidence that the right option for health reform is an extension of Medicare for all, not this piece-meal attempt to appease health insurers and health providers by attempting to guarantee that they can still reap huge profits out of what should be a universally provided public good.</p>

<p>Super Committee and GME funding</p>
<p>SO, about that super committee. Surely you remember,  the gang of 12 that was created by the showdown over the debt ceiling this summer.  Well, they’re hard at work but among the proposals out there, is one that is causing some grave concerns. </p>
<p>As a health workforce researcher, I understand implicitly the difficulties that lie ahead and the underlying shortage of physicians that will worsen dramatically by 2025. Current estimates suggest a shortage of over a 130,000 physicians by that time.  Many, if not most, do not realize that physician training, at least the post graduate residency phase, is paid for by CMS (Center for Medicare Services). </p>
<p>Currently, as we all know, if the super committee does nothing, there will be an across the board 2% cut to all federal discretionary spending. Some of the other proposals are a little more concerning.  In 2010, direct GME expenses totaled 9.5 billion. IME or Indirect Medical Education expenses totaled an additional 6 billion. <br />IME represents an additional 5.5 % payment to teaching hospitals, as it is understood that they not only teach other health professionals, but that there may be extra costs associated with education. Current proposals are to cut that rate in half (first proposed by Simpson-Bowles) to 2.2%.  Among other proposals which include Home Health Co-Pays, SNF (skilled nursing facility) shared payments, raising Medicare eligibility to the age of 67, lies a proposal by the House Ways and Means Committee to cut GME funding by 15 billion over the next ten years, or a 15.7% cut. It is unknown at this time if the Committee will pursue this, but this is problematic.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Adding to the problem is the current GME Cap placed in effect in 1997, when several organizations were predicting an oversupply of physicians.  This is not our current concern. This cap is problematic, and with the current budgetary concerns has no chance of changing. By 2015, we will have had over a 30% increase in medical school graduates from 2000. There is significant concern that also by 2015, we will not have enough GME residency slots for all US graduates, without even mentioning the several thousand US citizens who go to foreign medical schools every year. </p>
<p>States have already reduced the amount of money in the GME system, with only 41 states participating, and contributing a little over 3 billion annually. Nine additional states are now likely to opt out as well. </p>
<p>We need a serious look at discretionary spending, but this will only compound and weaken an already distressed healthcare system.  I hope that the Super Committee strongly considers this, and looks to other alternatives.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;m not going to do this with graphics (at least for now), but the finger exercise seems intuitive.</p>
<p>Assume—<a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/06/08/getting-insurance-work">against</a> <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/mckinseygate/">all</a> <a href="http://health.newamerica.net/blogposts/2011/questioning_the_mckinsey_study_someone_should_ask_bowen_garrett-53161">evidence</a>—that the &#8220;once we educated them, 30% said they would stop offering health insurance to their lowest-paid employees&#8221; study is <em>accurate</em>.</p>
<p>How does that, <a href="http://www.speaker.gov/Blog/?postid=245058">as John Boehner declares</a>, cost America jobs?</p>
<p>From Boehner&#8217;s site:<br />
<blockquote>At least 30 percent of employers would gain economically from dropping coverage even if they completely compensated employees for the change through other benefit offerings or higher salaries.</p></blockquote>
<p>This should be intuitive. If the company is paying $1,000 a month for my family&#8217;s health care along with my $800 a month,* it can raise my paycheck by $1,000 a month—employee compensation is employee compensation—<em>and</em> cut back on its health care administration. If I&#8217;m not a health-care administrator, it&#8217;s win-win.**<br />
<blockquote><strong>Aside</strong>: Reality <em>will</em> interfere. If we make the Baumolian assumption that cost of health insurance will continue to grow faster than GDP—at a slower rate, probably, but still faster—I&#8217;ll give you odds that the labor share of revenues will decline, <em>cet. par.</em> over time. But we&#8217;re talking about jobs, not profits.***</p></blockquote>
<p>Any economist worth her salt should know that lower costs of employment increase overall employment (assuming there is not a demand-side problem).</p>
<p>If the McKinsey &#8220;study&#8221; were accurate—again, not the way to bet—we should expect overall employment to <em>increase</em>. As with the <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Earned+Income+Tax+Credit&#038;hl=en&#038;as_sdt=1%2C33">Earned Income Tax Credit</a>, the expansion of HIEs will benefit firms, allowing them to reallocate capital into more useful areas.</p>
<p>The follow-on effects in that universe: more people joining the HIEs than expected, improvements in the measurement of &#8220;real&#8221; wage growth, greater transparency in the current health-insurance system, and arguably a larger contingency of workers demanding something closer to a single-payer solution,**** all improve efficiency and provide opportunity for economic expansion.</p>
<p>Which is supposed to mean more jobs, not fewer.</p>
<p>If the McKinsey presentation accurately reflects what companies will do given the opportunity—think the <a href="http://www.thirdworldtraveler.com/Corporate_Welfare/WalMart_Welfare.html">Wal-Mart Effect</a> Writ Large—then the prospects for employment will be, if anything, increased.</p>
<p>Greater political pressure for cost-reduction that leads to single-payer becoming more politically viable is just lagniappe.</p>
<p>*Not the real numbers, of course.</p>
<p>**If I&#8217;m a Benefits Coordinator, I don&#8217;t lose my job, and I get to spend more time working on ensuring that the firm is competitive in other areas. If I were doing an economic model of this against employment, I would bet that the coefficient would be small but positive, so let&#8217;s be generous and assume it&#8217;s equivalent to zero, i.e., no effect on employment supply.</p>
<p>As an aside, this was in part the reasoning behind the Bear Stearns &#8220;bag of rubber bands, box of paper clips, go buy all your own supplies&#8221; thinking. It didn&#8217;t necessarily save on corporate expenses directly, but it meant not having to manage that area of inventory.</p>
<p>***If anything, the extra profits, <em>cet. par.</em>, facilitate business expansion and more hiring. That the multiplier effect will not be 1:1 simply reflects what a poor social investment private corporations are.</p>
<p>****More people forced to use the HIEs=> more people demanding similar plans across state lines => more demand for a larger uniform baseline (especially as families move from state to state) => more interest in cost controls => greater need to control Administrative expenses => disequilibrium in service demand and supply => demand for service efficiencies that result in either single-payer or, at worst, unified Servicer processing.</p>

                                <p>My wife had knee surgery recently.* One of the great things about our then-current health insurer is that they provide complete data—list price, what they negotiated, what they paid, what you owe. Since we’re in the “doughnut hole,” I’m tracking more frequently than I usually would. 
</p>
<p>
<p>And the bills—possibly because we were moving to a new provider—were processed quickly. So what you see below is, in percent form, the amount of the list price (in relation to the whole) and the net benefit to the provider (ibid.).</p>

<p>As you can see, the surgeon’s list price isn’t even close to the level he received, while the hospital and, especially, the anesthesiologist, did relatively better.</p>
<p>
<p>There are multiple possible reasons for this, and I don’t pretend this is representative of what everyone—or even everyone with my now-sadly-former Insurance Provider—would receive. The key finding is that all of these contracts and negotiations were carried on by a single entity (my insurance carrier) with each provider. Promises were made—volumes, volume discounts, speed of processing, and whatever else was agreed—and contracts agreed between parties.</p>
<p>
<p>All before I get involved.</p>
<p>
<p>Which means that the final figures are set in stone. I don’t get to negotiate them. Maybe I get to negotiate a payment schedule, but the levels themselves are set. So even if I believe that the pie should be distributed differently—that the hospital (and maybe the anesthesiologist my wife didn’t want in the first place) should get a little less while the surgeon gets a bit more, for instance—I don’t get a say in that.</p>
<p>
<p>Nor do I get the information before choosing an insurer. (If I even get to choose, which I do not in the case of employer-provided health insurance.)</p>
<p>
<p>Short version: my choices have no direct effect. There is a “market” for health care, but patient usage and expenditures has no direct effect on it.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
<p>*This occurred just as the company was being acquired and therefore our health plan was being transferred from one provider to another, but that’s another story for another time.</p>

<p><strong>Medical Tourism, separating facts from fiction</strong></p>
<p>One of the greatest myths that I hear on a somewhat regular basis, centers around the belief that the US must have one of the greatest health systems in the world, because everyone comes here for their care. Well, let’s examine that shall we?</p>
<p>As with many things, reality is a little different from the mythology. </p>
<p>According to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.deloitte.com/assets/Dcom-UnitedStates/Local%20Assets/Documents/us_chs_MedicalTourism_111209_web.pdf">Deloitte Center for Health Solutions</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.health-tourism.com/medical-tourism/statistics/">Health-tourism.com</a>, there will be roughly 561,000 inbound medical tourists to the United States by 2017….Conversely, 750,000 Americans traveled to foreign countries in 2007, and this grew to between 1.1 and 1.3 million outbound tourists in 2008. Spending on healthcare in foreign countries was estimated to be 20 billion dollars in 2008. </p>
<p>Estimates for growth demonstrate a consistent 35% growth in outbound medical tourism annually. Projections indicate that roughly 1.6-2.5 million Americans will travel abroad in 2012, and spending could reach 100 billion dollars. That’s right, 100 billion US dollars being spent in foreign countries for healthcare such as elective surgeries, complicated dental surgery, plastic surgery, and even coronary bypass surgery.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Where are they going?</p>
<p>According to survey results:</p>
<p>Thailand, with one hospital in Bangkok taking care of 64,000 US patients in 2006.<br />Singapore<br />Latin America<br />Mexico<br />Malaysia<br />India</p>
<p>Of these, India has the greatest potential for growth. </p>
<p>A legitimate question revolves around what reasons these patients are traveling for. Predictably, a lack of health insurance had a high correlation with travel for services. Surprisingly though, only 9% of patients who were surveyed listed price as the primary factor in their decision. </p>
<p>An entire industry is springing up to support this, and companies are now offering packages, and entering into arrangements with foreign hospitals. </p>
<p>What may or may not come as a surprise to many, is that, as the Deloitte report lists, there are many American Health Insurance companies that are entering into pilot studies sending American patients to foreign hospitals for treatment. </p>
<p>Some examples include: </p>
<p>Anthem BC/BS in Wisconsin (700 group members initially, being sent to India for treatment)</p>
<p>United Group in Florida (Promoting tourism to India and Thailand to 200,000 members)</p>
<p>BC/BS of South Carolina (Promoting tourism to Thailand)</p>
<p>So while there are foreign citizens who come to the US for treatment every year, it pales in comparison to the number of American citizens traveling elsewhere. </p>
<p>(Rdan here&#8230;One of the throw away lines about the where US Healthcare stood in the scheme of things is that Canadians come over the boarder for treatment, which is characterized as a comment on the Canadian healthcare system.  No numbers are ever provided even when requested&#8230;maybe it is more complex than many are willing to deal with)</p>

<p><strong>No Assumptions for a Change</strong></p>
<p>Assumptions are often incorrect and the assumptions are incredibly inaccurate in primary care and in basic health access. When one starts with the assumption of more pay, then it is easy to rationalize more training or more complexity of care &#8211; even when there is little evidence other than assumption.</p>
<p>Primary care is often more difficult than specialty care. <br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>A major reason is that the design of health care in the United States destroys primary care delivery. Reasons for primary care to be challenging are the complexity of the patients, the lack of support staff, the lack of primary care trained support staff, the lack of experienced support staff, the broad scope of primary care, the lack of respect for primary care by those who clearly have little clue regarding primary care delivery, and participating in smaller operations that are neglected by the health care design. </p>
<p>The fragmentation of care with even more fragmentation on the way is a problem. The required context of care includes major care provided by Americans most left out of the designs for health and education – who often cannot access care other than the basics. </p>
<p>The reimbursement for primary care that is less than the rapidly increasing cost of delivering primary care forces primary care practitioners to do additional efforts outside of primary care to support their primary care practices.</p>
<p>The decision to pay more for care other than primary care is arbitrary. This design was set up beginning 100 years ago by those who envisioned domination of all of health care and who assumed their superiority. Even in the 1940s medical leaders still understood the challenges facing generalists – because some generalists still were in leadership positions and other leaders had been generalists prior to their specialization. Once the entire context of selection, training, and practice support was designed subspecialist, this understanding was lost and the current assumptions reigned unchallenged. </p>
<p>The subspecialty and academic forces reached their domination in the last decades, rebounded from the managed care reforms with even greater domination – and the United States has all of the cost, quality, and access consequences now that cripple our nation and its people.</p>
<p>There is supporting evidence for primary care complexity as greater at the current time. This includes the fact that two-thirds of primary care graduates (28,000 from six sources) depart primary care. All types are departing primary care with 55 – 85% of graduates after graduation other than family medicine graduates (who have fewest other options).  There is lower national health spending on primary care (5% is all there is) and the locations where primary care workforce is highest percentage also receives lowest health care spending at 5% for rural locations and 5% for underserved locations. Established<br />primary care practitioners have continued to depart primary care even during the 1990s periods of increasing policy support (PA, IM), </p>
<p>Few that are found in direct patient care primary care delivery from nurse, advanced nursing, nurse practitioner, PA, and IM training. Pediatric and medicine pediatric training both now yield less than a majority for primary care as well. In all of these types as well as in family medicine, a minority fraction of the training is spent on primary care. Primary care basics are taught, but it takes a lifetime of dedication to patients and to primary care delivery to even begin to comprehend primary care. Compare primary care and specialty care after a decade of care delivery. Who is worth more &#8211; my vote is for a dedicated primary care practitioner in a continuity location with a continuity team? Perhaps many if not most would contest this, but most comparisons are apples and oranges as primary care is so poorly understood.Training that yields primary care as a side effect of specialty care is also apples and oranges as the RN, NP, PA, MD, and DO primary care should be primary care in selection, in training, and in a lifetime of care delivered. </p>
<p>The US needs a foundation of primary care – a balance between primary care and other care. The designs must support this. Even 80% of physicians support more funding for primary care delivery (Leigh) but when asked to give up a few percentage points of reimbursement (that might not even impair pay), physician support melted away.  </p>
<p>Once again I would note that nations need designs for care that serve nearly all in a nation nearly all of the years of their life in nearly all locations not a design that serves few for a few years in a few locations. </p>
<p>And there is always a nice video to review such as We&#8217;re Number 37 in health outcomes (www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVgOl3cETb4), not to mention a health care design that cripples our economy, all levels of government from schools to federal, our children, and our children&#8217;s children. </p>
<p>The current design ensures more graduates from NP, PA, DO, and MD with each passing year as well as higher percentages entering non-primary care as well as higher percentages of primary care graduates entering non-primary care. What we have is more like fantasy as compared to assumption.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <blockquote><p>&#8220;The practice of medicine was accepted to be a chancy way to make a living, and nobody expected a doctor to get rich, least of all the doctors themselves.&#8221;  &#8211; Lewis Thomas, <em>The Youngest Science, </em>p. 4 (Penguin, 1995 edition, quote via Google Books) </p></blockquote>
<p>Lost in the discussion of Paul Ryan’s “plan” is the group of entrepreneurs that will be most harmed economically by enacting it: doctors—most especially general practitioners.</p>
<p>I was speaking with <a href="http://www.economicprincipals.com/" target="_blank">David Warsh</a> last week at Kauffman, and pointed out what “everyone knows” but no one will say: U.S. doctors net about twice as much money as doctors in the rest of the civilized world. (As a ballpark, $200K in the U.S. and $100K elsewhere.)  And until you can solve some of that, you won’t really make much of a dent in the High Cost of Medicine.  David noted that solving that “isn’t going to happen.”</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Paul Ryan’s plan is a large step toward making it happen—just not in the way David (or I) would have expected it to happen.</p>
<p>Let’s sidebar the usually Capitation v. Fee-for-Service discussion, which will only have an effect at the margin.  Assume that doctors net, say, $25 per patient (net of paying for office staff, supplies, waste disposal, etc.).[1]  If they schedule four patients per hour ($100)[2] for eight hours a day ($800) five days a week ($4,000) for a fifty-week year ($200,000), they make their salary.</p>
<p>Note the assumptions I made: the per-patient return is certainly variable (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginal_cost">standard MC/MR curve</a>), so the real return is based on volume and where that volume falls on the MC curve.  So long as a doctor can schedule to see 160 people a week—8,000 visits a year—they are continually busy and receive optimal returns.</p>
<p>But the market is not perfect.  I am of an age where a few visits a year is strongly suggested.  Tom or Rebecca, by contrast, go in once (if at all) and otherwise when they are unhealthy.[3]  It seems intuitive that, given search costs (think labor markets), a doctor’s practice is marginally more profitable with more repeat patients. Customer retention is therefore of enhanced value in the current equilibrium.[4]</p>
<p>But shifting the burden of payment while not capping insurance margins is also an easy first-order solution: fewer insured people, certainly; higher margins, probably (positive, maybe not significant), shifting of funds toward the sector that reduce overall consumption, and—inevitably—fewer doctor visits for the older and most likely to need care.</p>
<p>Note [4] above becomes relevant on the supply side; the relationship is weaker if still positive.  But the discretionary spending is reduced; Fee-for-Service fades except in the “concierge” segment of the market.  Capitation becomes the rule, and the model that has become prevalent—insurance companies guaranteeing doctors a salary—become the rule.</p>
<p>But visits to the doctor have declined, due to those most in need having the least ability to pay and therefore dropping off the insurance rolls.</p>
<p>So the insurance company doesn’t expect the doctor to make 8,000 separate treatments a year.  Or they do, but find at the end of the year that they were mistaken. The next year they offer to pay based not on 32 patients a day, but rather 30. And, given the frictions in the market, the majority of doctors agree, preferring the certainty of $187,500 a year to the risk of treating the uninsured, who are now a <em>much </em>riskier group.</p>
<p>And then the multiplier effect comes in.  Recall that there are fixed costs as well; doctors’s returns mirror the standard MC/MR curve.  So the actual loss begins gradually, but becomes steeper as the years go by—convexity effects appear.</p>
<p>Eventually, doctors have to right-size their practice. The current trend toward Vertical Integration may mitigate effects in the short term. But eventually—probably within 15 years, though it may take 20—doctors will find that their salaries (“net capitation fees”) are significantly closer to those of their European and Canadian peers.</p>
<p>Coincident to its effect on the poor and the elderly, Paul Ryan’s plan will speed the convergence of doctors’s salaries in the world.  The aspiring doctor in the Harvard Class of 2037 may well look at Lewis Thomas’s thoughts of one hundred years previous and say, “Nothing ever changes.”</p>
<p>The question that remains today is “What will we tell the doctors?”</p>
<p>[1]When I looked a few years ago, my doctor was paid $41 for my $125 office visit from insurance, and I had a $15 copay.  If you can’t figure out how $56 gross can become $25 net, go into a heavy-service industry, such as restaurants or doctoring, and look at their cash flows.</p>
<p>[2]Note that there is no inherent need to conform to the schedule, assuming the patients are not time-constrained.  That is, one can spend longer with patients—more than eight hours in a day—and maintain quality of care at the expense of leisure time.  This is a fairly simple equation and is left for when this isn’t a blog post.</p>
<p>[3]Again, the equation to show when the marginally-unhealthy choose to visit the doctor is left as an exercise. All we need for blog post purposes is to know that the choice is dependent on several factors, including disposable income and out-of-pocket cost.</p>
<p>[4]This is in no small part, at the margin, due to the support of the current Medicare/Medicaid system.</p>
<p>[5]Contracts still require both parties to consent, and the 6.6% decline is the net result—one might assume that some insurance companies will reduce their margins to pay doctors more.  One might also assume a pony with a pointy thing sticking out of its forehead with equal likelihood. There may well be a chimera of hope—though the scenario only extends the timeframe instead of ending the process—but it will not be sustainable, though it may be iterative (which would further attenuate the process).</p>

                                <p>By: Daniel Becker</p>
<p>  
<div>Just a little something that came <a href="http://www.painphysicianjournal.com/2011/march/2011;14;E133-E156.pdf">across my desk.</a> As you read it, think about the concept: War on Drugs. </div>
<blockquote><div>“In the United States, the therapeutic use of opioids has exploded as witnessed by the increased sales of hydrocodone by 280% from 1997 to 2007, while at the same time methadone usage increased 1,293% and oxycodone increased 866% (5). In addition, the estimated number of prescriptions filled for controlled substances increased from 222 million in 1994 to 354 million in 2003 (5). Consequently, the milligram per person use of therapeutic opioids in the United States increased from 73.59 milligrams in 1997 to 329.23 milligrams in 2006, an increase of 347% (5). And, while hydrocodone is the most commonly used opioid in the United States, based on milligrams per person, oxycodone is the most commonly used drug with methadone use rapidly increasing the most&#8230; Consequently, Americans, constituting only 4.6% of the world’s population, have been consuming 80% of the global opioid supply, and 99% of the global hydrocodone supply, as well as two-thirds of the world’s illegal drugs (4-6,26-29).”</div>
</blockquote>
<div>Read the whole study. There is a lot of info regarding the particular drugs. For instance, one researcher found that they had no effect on one&#8217;s ability to drive. Though another found there were cognitive issues. So, are they or are they not getting high?</div>
<div></div>
<div>I have all sorts of thoughts about it. Depression is highly associated with pain. That is, more pain is reported as depression is experienced and more depression is reported as pain is experienced. Emotional pain? Physical Pain? Are doctors just becoming more comfortable with such prescription practices, thus a kind of &#8220;heard&#8221; mentality? I mean, once you put them into happy land drug wise, there&#8217;s nothing left to do. Next patient please.</div>
<p><a name="more"></a>
<div>What does it say about our population? Our character? Our solutions we propose for all sorts of social issues? I don&#8217;t think it says much for the results we can expect if the increasing solution is to alter the brain chemistry. Can you say “framing”. Yes, I knew you could. Can&#8217;t imagine we have the character any more that produced things like the Hoover Dam (on time and budget with wealth creating benefit for all) which makes me cautious regarding any proposed “green economy” projects like a national high speed rail system. Was “hope” the drug for 2008? </div>

<div><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cf/ConsumerConfidenceIndexUSA.png">Consumer confidence</a> has been going steadily down since year 2000.  <a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/United_States_Consumer_Confidence_1978-2010.jpg">And here.</a>    Consumer confidence is the highest in 3 years say the reports. Big whoop! <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/Economics/Consumer-Confidence.aspx?Symbol=USD">Set the date for 1967</a>. You&#8217;ll see we have managed to rise to the level of the bottoming for all the other recessions.   That&#8217;s a lot of pain&#8230;or depression. And, for a long time now. We are not kidding when we say “the good old day”. But then I&#8217;m told that the reason there seemed to be more snow when I was young is because I was shorter. It&#8217;s all relative. </div>
<div></div>
<div>There is real, as in non-virtual, pain increases being reported: </p>
<p>
<blockquote>“Chronic pain’s prevalence and associated disability continue to increase. Harkness et al (181), in a 2000 publication, showed that there was a large difference in the prevalence of musculoskeletal pain over a 40- year period under investigation. The results showed that overall, the prevalence of low back pain increased from 8.1% in males to 17.8%, and in females, it increased from 9.1% to 18.2%. Similarly, Freburger et al (182) reported the rising prevalence of chronic low back pain following an evaluation of North Carolina (U.S.) households conducted in 1992 and repeated in 2006. The results showed a 162% increase in the prevalence of chronic impairing low back pain over the 14-year interval, going from 3.9% in 1992 to 10.2% in 2006 and an annual average increase of 11.6% associated with care-seeking and disability.”</p></blockquote>
<p>I prescribe the “cold turkey” therapy in all it&#8217;s applications.   There was even <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066927/">a movie about it</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Reverend Brooks leads the town in a contest to stop smoking for a month, But some tobacco executives don&#8217;t want them to win, and try everything they can to make them smoke. If townspeople don&#8217;t go nuts, from wanting a cigarette, or kill each other from irritation and frustration, they will will a huge prize.</p></blockquote>

<div>Oh the pain, the pain.</div>

<div>All I can say, is the war is in your head man.</div>

                                <p>by Daniel Becker</p>
<p>I posted in 7/2009 on the issue of fixing our healthcare system based on the Massachusetts model. The first was <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/massachusetts-is-fixing-fixed-health.html">Massachusetts is fixing the fixed healthcare system</a>.   The second was a followup to the first:  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/07/fixing-fixing-health-care-deja-vu.html">Fixing the fixing. Healthcare Deja vu.</a></p>
<p>The issue was that we are dancing around. All the proposals to date have been nothing more than a relabeling of already tried organizational structuring within the private insurance model.  I ended the first article with a quote from a NEJM report and a my question:</p>
<blockquote><p>Despite these imprecisions, the difference in the costs of health care administration between the United States and Canada is clearly large and growing. <strong>Is $294.3 billion annually for U.S. health care administration money well spent?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Well, is it? Did they even ask?</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>I ended the second article with: </p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re talking the same old approach to what really is a problem with the product. At least in the bad socialist health care programs they recognize that a for profit third party only adds cost and thus do not have to account for that part of our problem (it&#8217;s called savings). They just need to resolve the product quality issue. It is the only common issue to all nations. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m taking bets on the date of the new fix of the newly fixed, fixed system. </p></blockquote>
<p>Ok folks. The betting is closed. Time to lay the cards on the table. </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />US News and World Report: <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/news/2011/march/mass-health-reform-hasnt-halted-medical-bankruptcies">Mass. Health Reform Hasn&#8217;t Halted Medical Bankruptcies</a> </p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Health costs in the state have risen sharply since reform was enacted. Even before the changes in health care laws, most medical bankruptcies in Massachusetts &#8212; as in other states &#8212; afflicted middle-class families with health insurance. High premium costs and gaps in coverage &#8212; co-payments, deductibles and uncovered services &#8212; often left insured families liable for substantial out-of-pocket costs. None of that changed. For example, under Massachusetts&#8217; reform, the least expensive individual coverage available to a 56-year-old Bostonian carries a premium of $5,616, a deductible of $2,000, and covers only 80 percent of the next $15,000 in costs for covered services,&#8221; the researchers wrote.</p></blockquote>
<p>The results from the actual published article in <a href="http://www.pnhp.org/sites/default/files/docs/2011/AJM_Mass-Reform-hasnt-stopped-med-bankruptcies.pdf">The American Journal of Medicine</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>In 2009, illness or medical bills contributed to 52.9% of bankruptcies in Massachusetts. In contrast, in early 2007, medical bankruptcies accounted for 59.3% of personal bankruptcies in the state (P#.44 for comparison with 2009 proportion) and 62.1% nationally (P#.02). Because the total number of personal bankruptcy filings in Massachusetts increased by 51% between fiscal years 2007 and 2009(6) the absolute number of <strong>medical bankruptcies in the state actually increased by more than one third during that period, from 7504 to 10,093</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The profile of the bankruptcies:</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Most of the recent Massachusetts debtors were female (Table 1). Their average age was 48.2 years, two thirds of them had attended college, and 70.5% owned a home or had owned one within the past 5 years. The average debtor household included 2.94 persons; in three quarters of them, at least 1 adult was employed at the time of bankruptcy filing.</p>
<p>In 2009, 45.6% of the entire sample (86.2% of the medically bankrupt) had high medical bills or specifically cited illness as a cause of their bankruptcy, proportions that did not vary by insurance</p>
<p>status. The remaining 13.8% of the medically bankrupt (7.3% of the entire sample) were classified as medically bankrupt because they had lost significant work-related income because of illness or had mortgaged a home to pay medical bills.</p>
<p>As would be expected in a state where medical insurance is mandatory, the overwhelming majority (89.0%) of debtors had health insurance for themselves and all of their dependents at the time of bankruptcy filing&#8230;</p>
<p>The 2009 coverage rates in Massachusetts were higher than those for Massachusetts debtors in 2007 (before the coverage mandate was enforced), when 84.1% had insurance at the time of filing and approximately one third (34.1%) had experienced a coverage gap. In both 2007 and 2009, Massachusetts debtors’ had higher coverage rates than in our 2007 national sample, in which only 69.7% of bankrupt families were insured at the time of filing and 37.4% had experienced a gap.</p></blockquote>
