                                <p>My Loyal Reader notes that the economic survival of Zimbabwe&#8217;s current government is now <a target="blank" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/03/18/zimbabwe.finance/">largely dependent on sin taxes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>As he presented his revised 2009 budget to parliament, Finance Minister Tendai Biti noted that &#8220;indirect taxes made up of customs and excise duty have contributed 88 percent of government revenue, which means that the government has been literally sustained by beer and cigarettes.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>Those who are planning to &#8220;go Galt&#8221; will need also to Sin No More.</p>

<blockquote>Guess who won Joe the Plumber’s vote&#8230;real people who make about $42,000 a year, the median income for plumbers and pipefitters. Barack Obama carried hard-working Americans of that income stripe by 10 points, according to exit polls.</p>
<p>And the only voters who were told directly that their taxes would go up under a new Democratic president? <strong>Obama took the rich as well, winning by six points that small sliver of the electorate that makes more than $200,000 [per] year.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>The HENRYs can do basic probability calculations, it seems.  &#8220;Saving&#8221; 5% on your taxes while losing 15% on your non-deductible investments is not a great long-term strategy, no matter what <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/11/greg-mankiw-claimsyoung-voters-are.html">Greg Mankiw may have decided to hear from his self-selected group</a>.</p>

                                <p>by: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>In a <a href="http://faithfulprogressive.blogspot.com/2008/10/famous-socialist-presidents-eisenhower.html">posting regarding </a>which presidents would be considered socialist I found the following curious:<br />1921 &#8211; 4% 73% Census<br />1922 &#8211; 4% 56% Census<br />1923 &#8211; 3% 56% Census<br />1924 &#8211; 1.5% 46% Census<br />1925-1928 &#8211; 1.5% 25% Census<br />1929 &#8211; 0.375% 24% Census<br />1930-1931 &#8211; 1.125% 25% Census</p>
<p>1982-1986 12 brackets 12% 50% IRS<br />1987 5 brackets 11% 38.5% IRS<br />1988-1990 3 brackets 15% 33% IRS<br />1991-1992 3 brackets 15% 31% IRS</p>
<p>2001 5 brackets 15% 39.1% IRS<br />2002 6 brackets 10% 38.6% IRS<br />2003-2008 6 brackets 10% 35% IRS</p>
<p>Notice anything about these 3 groups of income tax rates?  No, I&#8217;m not suggesting that the lower rates are the smoking gun of today&#8217;s economic crap.  Don&#8217;t want to run afoul of those scoldings of  association is not causation critiques.  But, do you not find it just a bit curious that approximately 8 years prior to an economic troubling time we get talked into reducing that tax rates?  Three periods in history, all preceding an economy of crap.  Varying degrees of crap, but  crap just the same.   We even had a housing bubble for 2 of them!</p>
<p>None of these tax changes can happen without convincing.  A dialog has to have happened to convince the people that it is a good idea.  And, I bet that the rhetoric of tax reduction is only part of a package regarding the overall idea of what is best to “grow the economy”.   I bet, that tax reduction presentations have never been presented as a stand alone, single issue, unrelated to accomplishing a  larger money shift.  Being that we are relating today to the Big One, while at the same time hearing muttering that we are in &#8220;new territory&#8221;,  my Angry Bear side asked: What else is similarly presented in the 20&#8217;s as part of a sales job of an over all ideology that preceded today&#8217;s and yesterday&#8217;s crap?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.1920-30.com/business/instalment-plan.html">Installment Sell</a><br />
<blockquote>Manufacturers realized they could expand their profits if they could grow their markets and so installment selling was introduced. The increased production volumes reduced the unit cost of items making them more affordable, and easy terms made for easy sales. </p></blockquote>
<p>There is a <a href="http://www.1920-30.com/business/instalment-selling.html">reprint of an article</a> specifically looking at the pros and cons of credit purchasing.  Rather fascinating reading.<br />
<blockquote>PAYING FOR THINGS ON &#8220;EASY&#8221; TERMS has become such a conspicuous element in American life, and so large a factor in our prosperity, that the economists have been doing a great deal of worrying about it.  Source: The Literary Digest for March 5, 1927 </p></blockquote>
<p>  Sub-prime anyone?  Oh, did you notice that it was a concerted effort to sell the consumer that installment purchasing was good?  I wonder if blaming the consumer for spending what they did not have was part of the discussion when the economy turned to crap then?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.1920-30.com/business/wall-street-bonuses.html">THE CHRISTMAS CHEER IN WALL STREET 1926</a><br />
<blockquote>Christmas distribution of bonuses in Wall Street, when finally added up, is expected to prove the most generous ever made except during some of the flush World War years. </p>
<p>No accurate account of sums paid out can be made, according to the New York Times, because many firms do not announce their benefactions, but last year&#8217;s total was estimated at $50,000,000, and it is expected that the Wall Street firms paying bonuses are being no less generous this year. In fact, some firms which have never paid bonuses will start the custom this Christmas. <strong>Probably the largest distribution, we read, is being made by banks, which have been exceptionally prosperous</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Converting that $50 million we get various amounts: $586 million via CPI, $494 million via GDP deflator, and (drum roll please), $1.999 million via unskilled wage factor. </p>
<p>There was <a href="http://www.1920-30.com/business/china-market.html">one perspective</a> that was not accurate in their prophecies for America:<br />
<blockquote>America has played square in China, and will have an inside track in China against the commerce of other nations. <br />China buys one billion dollars worth of outside goods every year. But that&#8217;s only, a drop in the bucket compared with what this customer may buy some day. &#8220;When the per capita foreign trade of China,&#8221; runs one government report, &#8220;is equal to that of Australia, the total will be sixty-five billion dollars a year <strong>which China will pay to the outside world for her imports.</strong>&#8221; <br />&#8220;You can&#8217;t help seeing American business grow in China,&#8221; a business man from China told me. &#8220;Why, it has multiplied itself by four within the past dozen years. It&#8217;s eight times bigger than it, was thirty years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>The inaccuracy?  The quotes are from a perspective of the American selling to China, not from China.  And you thought Nixon opened up China.</p>
<p>Getting back specifically to the tax reductions, this web site offers a lot: <a href="http://www.tax.org/Museum/default.htm">The Tax History Museum</a><br />From <a href="http://www.tax.org/Museum/1901-1932.htm">reading the site</a>, it appears a progressive tax system was put in place for the WW I war effort.   They even put in a munitions tax to &#8220;appease&#8221; opponents of American involvement in the war; <em>levied on manufacturers of military equipment, it was designed to prevent war profiteering”.  </em>There was an “excess profits” tax put in place which appears to be what the later progressive income tax became.   Arguments for it were as today: equality.  Against it:<br />
<blockquote>It attracted bitter opposition from business groups, who considered the tax a threat to managerial prerogatives. They were certainly justified in their suspicion, since both Wilson and his allies in Congress <em>considered the levy a legitimate means of <strong>business regulation</strong></em>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well slap me silly!  A tax used to curb the excess of business.  I hear some of you saying: Excessive CEO compensation regulation please?</p>
<p>After the war, the argument was that such high rates were “unsustainable”.  It was the party of today&#8217;s tax cuts who yesterday cut the taxes:<br />
<blockquote>Republican lawmakers joined with a series of GOP presidents to engineer tax cuts in 1921, 1924, 1926, and 1928. Andrew Mellon — who moved into his Treasury office in 1921 and stayed their until 1932 — was the principal architect of these reforms.</p></blockquote>
<p>Certainly some Democratic elected joined in (early Blue Dogs, DLC&#8217;s of their time?).</p>
<p>In 1980 we got schooled in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Stockman">Stockman trickle down theory</a> of economic growth which included lower taxes will raise collections and bolsters economic growth. It was all about cutting taxes by his confession though.  So, as I look to find evidence of selling tax cuts as a part of an ideology sell job regarding how an economy should run, such being clues that in the near future we will have economic crap, the following regarding Mr. Mellon&#8217;s position just confirms how ignorant we have been in our recent times (post 1981) to have followed those who suggest tax cuts as part of their economic program: <br />
<blockquote>“Any man of energy and initiative in this country can get what he wants out of life,” he wrote. “But when initiative is crippled by legislation or by a tax system which denies him the right to receive a reasonable share of his earnings, then he will no longer exert himself and the country will be deprived of the energy on which its continued greatness depends.” </p>
<p>Worse yet, Mellon argued, high rates didn’t even raise money. By encouraging both legal tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion, they eroded the tax base and reduced overall revenue. Lower rates, he said, would actually raise money by spurring economic growth and reducing the incentive for tax avoidance. “It seems difficult for some to understand,” he complained, “that high rates of taxation do not necessarily mean large revenue to the government, and that more revenue may actually be obtained by lower rates.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Can we have been any more stupid, shown our ignorance more than to have taken as a new idea, language regarding taxation&#8217;s need to be reduced and it&#8217;s effect on filling the government coffers that is as old as almost the day progressive taxation came into existence?  Unfortunately, our stupidity has been worse than accepting Mr. Mellon&#8217;s similar arguments to those used by Reagan et al suggests.  That is because, back in Mr. Mellon&#8217;s day he at least understood what Mr. Buffet of today understands but congress and by extension US do not:<br />
<blockquote>Of particular note, he suggested taxing “earned” income from wages and salaries more lightly that “unearned” income from investments. As he argued:</p>
<p><em>The fairness of taxing more lightly income from wages, salaries or from investments is beyond question. In the first case, the income is uncertain and limited in duration; sickness or death destroys it and old age diminishes it; in the other, the source of income continues; the income may be disposed of during a man’s life and it descends to his heirs.</p>
<p><strong>Surely we can afford to make a distinction between the people whose only capital is their metal and physical energy and the people whose income is derived from investments. </strong>Such a distinction would mean much to millions of American workers and would be an added inspiration to the man who must provide a competence during his few productive years to care for himself and his family when his earnings capacity is at an end.</em> </p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>The Tax Foundation sent me an e-mail pointing me to <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/23599.html">Gerald Prante</a> (who&#8217;s participated in our comments section in the past) taking <a href="http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/09/mccains_health_care_tax_increa.html">Joe Klein</a> to task for calling McCain&#8217;s proposed $5,000* refundable tax credit that would offset income tax on health insurance benefits &#8220;insufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the McCain web site has to say:<br />
<blockquote>While still having the option of employer-based coverage, every family will receive a direct refundable tax credit &#8211; effectively cash &#8211; of $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families to offset the cost of insurance. Families will be able to choose the insurance provider that suits them best and the money would be sent directly to the insurance provider. Those obtaining innovative insurance that costs less than the credit can deposit the remainder in expanded Health Savings Accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The McCain campaign already deserves a few demerits for this representation of the plan.  First, they don&#8217;t mention the tax increase that the health insurance credit offsets.  Second, a credit that&#8217;s provided directly to insurers in lieu of (some) insurance premiums and then could be rolled over into an HSA if there&#8217;s something left over (which there won&#8217;t be for any family buying low-deductible health insurance) doesn&#8217;t sound much like it&#8217;s &#8220;effectively cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Klein calls the McCain credit &#8220;insufficient&#8221; because it won&#8217;t pay the premium for typical employer-provided family coverage.  (<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/411750_updated_candidates_summary.pdf">Analysis</a> [PDF] of the plan by the Tax Policy Center indeed yields the result that the McCain plan would not provide for much insurance uptake among the currently-uninsured.)  Prante claims that Klein doesn&#8217;t know the difference between a credit and a deduction, and provides a calculation purporting to show that the value of the deduction that McCain would repeal is less than the credit:<br />
<blockquote>What [Klein] fails to understand is that the $5,000 value of the credit would be worth more than the current exclusion for almost any taxpayer. For example, a family in the 25% bracket would have its income tax before credits increase by .25 * 12,000 = $3,000. However, the family would be getting a $5,000 CREDIT that trumps the $3,000 extra in taxes from the elimination of the exclusion. Even&#8230; in the 35% bracket, the family having $12,000 in insurance would come out ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>End of story?  Not quite.</p>
<p>In the quibble department, Prante assumes that the federal income tax exclusion can be repealed without state tax consequences.  To the extent state income definitions follow the feds, state taxes would take away several hundred more dollars of the credit.</p>
<p>The big question is whether today&#8217;s $12,000 employer-sponsored plan would still be available for no more than $12,000.  That depends on factors such as the employer exercising its &#8220;option&#8221; to continue to offer a group plan, and healthy members of the group resisting the incentives that the McCain plan provides to defect to the high-deductible insurance/HSA combination.</p>
<p>While McCain promotes the &#8220;option&#8221; of retaining existing coverage, the McCain plan&#8217;s incentives exacerbate &#8220;adverse selection death spiral&#8221; problems that particularly affect small groups under current policies.  That is, increasing the price of insurance coverage on the margin would encourage the healthy and/or lucky-feeling to exit relatively expensive group plans, with the tax credit intended to encourage substituting the combination of a high-deductible individual plan and accompanying HSA.  This leaves the comprehensive plans&#8217; members sicker, or at least lossier, and drives up prices for remaining participants.  (Repeat until the high price collapses the plan.)  The <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.27.6.w472/DC1">Buchmueller et al. review of the McCain plan</a> in Health Affairs mentions but does not quantify the potential effects of breaking up existing risk pools.</p>
<p>For employees sent to the individual market because employers drop group coverage, Buchmueller et al. suggest that insurance expenditures would increase markedly.  They indicate that the typical $12,000 group policy for a family would cost roughly $2,000 more to obtain in the individual market (and note that many plans in the individual market have lower prices but much lower coverage).</p>
<p>In Prante&#8217;s calculation, the $12,000 policy costs someone in the 25% bracket $9000 after income tax.  The $14,000 equivalent individual policy with the McCain family-level tax credit costs $9000 after income tax.  So we&#8217;ve already exhausted the purported net benefit of the McCain tax credit for a family that wants to keep its coverage but is knocked out of the employer-sponsored group market.  But the situation is actually worse than that, because shifting $9000 in compensation from benefits, which apparently the McCain plan would still exempt from payroll taxes, to wages subjects the compensation in lieu of benefits to payroll tax as well.  This can increase taxes up to $1377 (at 15.3%) in this example, depending on where the hypothetical family&#8217;s wages stand with respect to the Social Security contribution and benefit base (currently $102,000).</p>
<p>Having <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/right-wing-anti-tax-machine-doesnt-have.html">recently seen</a> the Tax Foundation concerned about Obama policies that would raise tax rates a few percentage points on high earners, it would be remiss of me to point out that the combined tax rates on wages paid in lieu of health benefits would be just as high for middle-class taxpayers under McCain&#8217;s health plan. That&#8217;s 25% for federal income tax, 5% or so for state taxes, and 15.3% for payroll taxes, 45.3% altogether, for compensation that current law and Obama policies would tax at 0%!  (A new Tax Foundation <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/23610.html">issue brief</a> on the subject which otherwise mostly <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/395454361/this-is-a-joke.html">invents a big number</a> for the McCain plan&#8217;s reduction in the uninsured does at least acknowledge this in passing.)  Since the McCain plan would, in the estimation of Buchmueller et al., shift millions of workers and their dependents to the individual market (representing 5 to about 15 percent of individuals covered under employer-sponsored plans; references in the article), the prospect of tax increases under the McCain plan is by no means vanishingly rare.  Indeed, shifting people to the individual market is basically a feature of the plan, and not a bug — a part of the program is to de-link employment and health insurance and that&#8217;s a legitimate policy goal.</p>
<p>This also leaves the question of just why conservative health reformers think we need to impose what amounts (vs. current policy) to a Pigovian tax on health insurance.  In the <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.27.6.w462/DC1">companion piece on the Obama plan</a> by Antos et al. also in Health Affairs, there&#8217;s talk of &#8220;perverse incentives&#8221; under the current system but not a lot of beef beyond econ 101-style handwaving:<br />
<blockquote>The following analysis reflects the authors&#8217; concern that Senator Obama&#8217;s failure to address the perverse incentives in the U.S. health system will exacerbate the cost problem he has argued must be solved if we are to achieve anything close to universal coverage. Tax subsidies that promote first-dollar coverage have led consumers, health care providers, and suppliers to act as if any service that might yield some value, no matter how small, should be covered. Subsidized third-party payment has helped drive up health spending and, as demonstrated by the <em>Dartmouth Atlas,</em> sometimes has even led to poorer health outcomes. Realistic expectations about cost, value, and the outcomes that health care is likely to provide must be better understood by all parties.</p></blockquote>
<p>An upshot of recent <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/alice-in-co-payland.html">health-care cost-shifting</a> between employers and employees is that &#8220;first-dollar&#8221; coverage is now rare.  I&#8217;ve had true first-dollar coverage in the distant past, ain&#8217;t got it now, and couldn&#8217;t have it for a premium that would keep my small employer-sponsored group together.  A main idea behind copayments and coinsurance is to avoid some obvious free-as-in-beer-goods problems by not covering the first dollar.</p>
<p>Moreover, they totally beg a central economic efficiency question: given the disconnection between health care prices and marginal costs, it&#8217;s far obvious that allocative efficiency is better served by exposing consumers to something like the list prices of routine services as opposed to the co-payments or co-insurance.  (Exercises: What&#8217;s the marginal cost of a $150-list-price office visit where you spend 5 minutes with a nurse and 5 minutes with the doctor?  Of a $1000 CT scan?  The $200 month&#8217;s supply of an on-patent drug?)  Explanation of benefits forms provide routine evidence that much or most of the price of various health-care services is markup.**</p>
<p>Of course, dynamic efficiency considerations mean that incremental cost constraints must be satisfied somehow — marginal cost prices wouldn&#8217;t be compensatory for the doctors, clinics, and hospitals.  But efficiency-improving pricing arrangments that better align prices with marginal costs such as &#8220;two-part tariffs&#8221; (where customers pay a fixed charge plus variable usage-based charges; see e.g. your electric, gas, or [limited-usage] phone bill) can look a lot more like traditional insurance with what Antos et al. characterize as &#8220;modest&#8221; cost sharing than a high-deductible health plan plus an HSA.  On this front, the conservative reform approach involves an unforgivable conflation of price and cost.***</p>
<p>Nor do some of the &#8220;perversions&#8221; sound all that perverse as features of private or social insurance.  On Obama&#8217;s proposal to establish a federal reinsurance pool, Antos et al. write:<br />
<blockquote>Even though employers would welcome the subsidy, the reinsurance does not reduce health care use or cost. Instead, the policy just shifts some of the cost to the federal budget and could even increase health care spending. Insurers and providers might be encouraged to provide more services to patients who were above the catastrophic threshold since the federal government was sharing in the cost.</p>
<p>The proposal could also lead to anomalous results. One neonatal intensive care stay could lead to federal catastrophic payments for an employer with younger employees (and lower health costs per employee), while an employer with older workers and much higher per employee costs might receive no subsidy for the costs of managing chronic conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is just about 180-degrees backwards.  True, risk-spreading does not in itself reduce the cost of health care, but it does reduce the cost of health insurance, and reducing the cost of insurance helps promote efficient (multi-part) pricing of health care.  Moreover, million-dollar NICU trips and the like are exactly the sort of losses for which reinsurance is appropriate.  In the absence of adequate reinsurance, catastrophic losses are a death-spiral trigger, since especially small groups end up with huge premium increases leading to collapse of the plans one way or another.   As for covering chronic conditions such as aging, the factoid that most of us would like to grow old and healthy, and be well-cared-for in the alternative, suggests a role for intergenerational transfer mechanisms for equitable distribution of the costs.</p>
<p>It might be argued that the reinsurance services could be provided privately, but what I&#8217;ve heard from people involved with such matters at local health insurers is that health care reinsurance isn&#8217;t a candidate for Marginal Revolution&#8217;s &#8216;markets in everything&#8217; series.</p>
<p>Hoisted from our archives, here&#8217;s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/kerrys-health-care-reinsurance.html">Kash from 2004</a> addressing the question of whether the reinsurance pool (also a Kerry proposal) would increase costs:<br />
<blockquote>How would this national reinsurance pool help our nation&#8217;s health care problem? In a couple of ways. First and most obviously, it would simply reduce the cost to health insurers of providing health insurance, resulting in lower premiums. Part of this cost would be shifted to taxpayers, but as we shall see, the cost to taxpayers will be less than the savings reaped by people buying health insurance&#8230;</p>
<p>Think of it this way. Since the claims for one seriously ill person can easily reach $100,000 or more in a year (while most people&#8217;s claims are probably just in the hundreds of dollars), it&#8217;s much harder for an insurance company to predict what the aggregate health care costs will be of a group of 10 people compared to a group of 1,000 people. The law of large numbers means that you can pretty much rely on population averages when trying to guess how much health care the large group will need over the year; but for the small group, you either have to spend a lot of time and energy evaluating each of the 10 individuals to estimate each one&#8217;s likely health care needs for the coming year, or else you have to just take a chance. And insurance companies hate just taking chances.</p>
<p>The best estimates that I have seen by an economist of the effects of this reinsurance proposal are those by Kenneth Thorpe, professor at Emory&#8217;s school of public health. <a href="http://www.sph.emory.edu/hpm/thorpe/nobugthorpe2.pdf">He estimates</a> that the Kerry plan would reduce the variance of firms&#8217; insurance claims by about 50 percent. This in turn will have two effects. It means that it will become dramatically cheaper for small firms to provide health insurance to their employees. Combined with the plan&#8217;s requirement that all participating firms offer health insurance to all employees, Thorpe estimates that about 3 million currently uninsured people will start receiving health insurance. This in turn will help to reduce the country&#8217;s overall health care costs by allowing more preventative care and early detection of health problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is, since insurance costs depend on the variance of the losses, insufficient reinsurance implies higher risk premia paid to insurers, and those premia are big.</p>
<p>So McCain policies would raise taxes on lots of middle-class workers and dramatically increase marginal tax rates on some middle-class earnings regardless of the net benefits (something conservatives wring their hands over in other contexts), not obviously in service of aligning health care prices and marginal costs and without features that promote efficient risk-sharing.  That&#8217;s changiness we shouldn&#8217;t believe in, my friends.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>* For a family; individuals would get $2500.  Observe that there&#8217;s a family insurance penalty in the plan, as family plan premiums are commonly more than double individual premiums.</p>
<p>** E.g., the negotiated price between my health plan and the UW hospital for my son&#8217;s emergency appendectomy last year was roughly 1/3 of list.</p>
<p>*** Yes, people use &#8220;cost&#8221; when they mean &#8220;price&#8221; colloquially all the time; the problem is not considering price/cost ratios carefully when arguing that one price promotes economic efficiency better than another.</p>

                                <p>EconomistMom recently <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/economistmom/~3/366267387/">defended</a>, after a fashion, Alex Brill and Alan Viard&#8217;s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/attacking-obamas-tax-plan-with-basic.html">notorious article</a> claiming that the Obama tax plan would raise effective marginal tax rates on middle-class taxpayers.  They&#8217;re making a mountain out of a molehill, she concludes, even incidentally distorting the Obama tax plans along the way, but to her knowledge (of the two of them) wouldn&#8217;t be deliberately dishonest.  More below the fold.</p>
<p>Before you say &#8220;born yesterday,&#8221; she&#8217;s almost surely right at the very least in the sense that if you&#8217;re running the in-house publication of a conservative think-tank, you need only run down (say) the list of the economist supporters the McCain economic &#8220;plan&#8221; — yes, even the <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/07/13/john-mccain-300-economists-support-my-economic-plannot/">subset who actually read it!</a> — to find people who earnestly believe that lack of incentives to make money is a serious problem for the U.S. economy and willing to write something up to that effect.  The economists are then pure (if deluded) and the upshot, for the policy entrepreneurs, is perhaps even better than hiring obvious hacks.  Among other things, real economists like Jonah Gelbach will engage those issues.</p>
<p>As a <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/angrybear/1159566016908375881/">comments-hoisting</a> aside, the Brill and Viard piece highlights a cost of conducting progressive policy through tax expenditures.  I don&#8217;t think even center-leftists of the Obama camp are necessarily opposed to public provision of the services they&#8217;re trying to fund through the tax system, but to some extent they&#8217;ve pre-compromised on packaging them as delectable tax cuts to make them appeal to conservatives.  At my <a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2005/10/vision-thing.html">old place</a>, I&#8217;d argued that liberal think-tankers need to take a lesson from the Heritage Foundations of the world and advocate the policies they really want:<br />
<blockquote>I agree with TCT [Madison&#8217;s late progressive newspaper] that CAP needs to eat its spinach [in the Popeye sense]. It comes across like a center-left-center quasi-counterbalance to the only moderately wingnutty American Enterprise Institute rather than what it arguably needs to be, which is the Heritage Foundation of the left.</p>
<p>The lack of boldness cited by TCT is particularly evident in a misplaced fetish of pragmatism. Why misguided? Sure, CAP policy proposals would constitute a distinct improvement over Bushism, but their chance of getting any of them enacted with Republicans in charge of the executive and legislative branches is effectively zero [this was written in 2005, but things have changed surprisingly little]. And CAP policy proposals are not likely to fire people up to elect Democrats.</p>
<p>There is consequently no cost to thinking bigger (abstracting from CAP&#8217;s funding sources), and in fact there are likely to be massive longer-term benefits in that incubating actual progressive ideas is an entrée to building a political coalition for their enactment&#8230; [R]ushing, or at least appearing to rush, into the vacuum left by right-running Republicans fractures the progressive vote.</p></blockquote>
<p>And for all that, the wingnuts pay liberals back for their efforts at compromise by complaining that those tax cuts just make the tax code more complicated and screw up &#8220;incentives.&#8221; </p>
<p>Meanwhile the marginal rate business seems to be a meme on the other side of the fence, as <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/08/obamas-top-marginal-tax-rate.html">Greg Mankiw heh-indeeds</a> a Tax Foundation blog post suggesting that the top effective Federal personal tax rate would increase roughly 10-12 percentage points under Obama tax proposals.  (See?) <a href="http://taxfoundation.org/blog/show/23491.html">Sez Bob Carroll</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Note: These calculations work as follows: (1) 37.9 percent equals the current 35 percent top income tax rate plus the current 2.9 percent Medicare tax rate; and (2) 48 to 50 percent equals Obama&#8217;s 39.6 percent top income tax rate plus the 2.9 percent Medicare tax rate plus his additional 2-to-4 percent hike in the Social Security tax rate plus an additional roughly 4.5 percent for the phase-out of personal exemption and certain itemized deductions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this calculation ingenuous and totally correct?  No, it is not.  Sort of like Brill and Viard, Carroll is calculating what will tend to be top inframarginal rates applying to portions of the income of the very well-to-do.  They don&#8217;t do much to characterize of the general tenor of the Obama tax plans as they&#8217;d affect the median voter — other than, maybe, the feature of shifting more of the tax burden back to the rich (apparently Prof. Mankiw <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2007/08/01/the-past-lucrative-life-of-feds-mishkin/">cares personally</a> about those rates).</p>
<p>First, a regularity of upper-income tax returns is that much or most of the income comes from non-wage sources that aren&#8217;t subject to the payroll tax. According to the latest (2006) <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/indtaxstats/article/0,,id=96981,00.html">tax filing statistics</a>, taxable returns with Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) between $500,000 and $1 million — the lower-middle class, per John McCain — reported on average $678,000 in AGI and $591,000 of taxable income, of which wages and salaries averaged only $320,000.   All that non-employment income would be taxed at no more than the statutory rate for ordinary income — so the difference there is the 35% Bush-era rate vs. the 39.6% Clinton-era rate.  Suggesting that the Clinton-era rates don&#8217;t provide sufficient incentives for the near-rich and rich to make more money is silly.</p>
<p>Another issue pertains to adding 4.5 percentage points for the exemption and deduction phaseouts to Obama&#8217;s rate.  The statutory phaseout rates are 2.8% for personal exemptions and 3% for itemized deductions, or 5.8%.  Nevertheless, Carroll is not being generous by charging Obama&#8217;s plans with 4.5% instead of 5.8%.  For one thing, the personal exemption is, except for weird cases — married taxpayers with adjusted gross income in a narrow band around $360,000 and next to nothing in itemized deductions — already phased out before you get to the top bracket.  So the effective net hit is no more than 3%, and probably a lot less if not zero. That&#8217;s because in this income range, the ordinary income tax interacts strongly with the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), with AMT taking away deductions given back by the phaseout of the phaseout.  (If you want to view that last sentence as an argument for tax re-simplification, I wouldn&#8217;t argue.)  It&#8217;s worth remembering that increased AMT incidence was a feature of the 2001 tax cuts from the perspective of reducing the law&#8217;s apparent revenue reduction and gulling the theoretically fiscally conservative into voting for them.</p>
<p>More broadly, this focuses attention where it should not be, which is to say the plight of the rich — who don&#8217;t especially need help (beyond generally sound economic policies) staying rich or getting richer.  Though it does seem, fortunately, that the Obama campaign has <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/ezraklein_archive?month=08&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=a_unified_message_on_mccains_e">figured out that they have an issue</a> there.</p>

                                <p>By: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>I am responding to a post put up at Crooks and Liars: <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/07/11/the-mccain-campaigns-small-business-myth/">The McCain campaign small business myth.</a></p>
<p>It presents that the myth is found in the number of small businesses in existance and what percentage of them earns $250,000 or more.  I love C and L, but this is just totally missing the ship (notice I did not say boat).</p>
<p>The lie to the McCain position on Obama&#8217;s tax plan is not in the number of small business in existence or in the number of small business making over $250,000/yr.</p>
<p>The lie to the McCain position is in the conflating of business income with personal income.  An S corp or a solo proprietorship business or any other similar configuration that is paying income tax on $250,000 is paying income tax on that money not because the business made that income and is keeping it because the business had plans for it. No, no, nooooooooo.   It is the owner of the income generator that made that income and they made it as personal income.  It is the amount of money remaining AFTER the business did it&#8217;s complete business thing for the year.  It is the money remaining AFTER the business spent on expanding jobs, or buying more equipment, or marketing, or adding new facilities, or expanding to China, or hedging its energy costs or PAYING IT&#8217;s BUSINESS RELATED TAXES.  It is the money that the owner of the income generator walked out the door with at the end of the year and then proceeded to use on their personal needs like: food, housing, transportation, oil futures, corn futures, GE, Haliburton stocks, boats, collectable cars, art, entertainment, lawn care, maid services, tuitions, security systems, etc.  </p>
<p>In fact, anyone who has started a business has experienced that moment when their accountant calls them up and says: “You owe income taxes.”  The rest of the conversation goes something like this: But, but, but, but, but&#8230;how can I owe taxes when I have no money left?  “Well” responds your accountant, “did you buy food?”.  Why yes I did, but I have nothing left.  “Then the money you bought food with is the income your business paid you and now you owe Uncle Sam”.  At that moment your stomach is getting ready to pay Uncle Sam as your legs are giving out.  Later on, when you are humming along and you are taking $250,000 out of your S corp because you had no more expenses the true nature of you spirituality shows through.  Either you think your taxes are too high, or you understand the benefits of paying taxes but think that spending more than the rest of the world combined on military is crazy.</p>
<p>Why the pundit&#8217;s on the Obama side have not pointed this conflation out, I do not know.  Do they not believe in education?  But, focusing on the number of businesses when the issue is personal income only allows the presentation on taxation and income to continue in the same vein as it has been continuing since Reagan.  It is a continuation of the same argument that has allowed us to accept that Walmart cheap is the same as more money in your pay check; or that the increased cost of your benefits are the same as more money in your paycheck; or that the rising share of income going to pay all your taxes owed is the results of some waste and greed and civil service unions and teacher unions and not the results of less income earned from your labor; or taking a pension fund away is OK because it was not money earned but money gifted.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m an S corp, I was a sole proprietorship and the other business is an S corp.   </p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t stop watching the shells we will never win the game of find the pea.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>Glancing through the CBO survey that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/greg-mankiw-j-t-young-everyone-cut-tax.html">only checked one side of the ledger, and therefore made Greg Mankiw happy</a>, I came across the data on Corporate Taxes paid, by Quintile of Income.</p>
<p>Now, there has been a groundswell of declarations that people aren&#8217;t &#8220;leaving the job market&#8221;; instead, they are supposedly being &#8220;entrepreneurs,&#8221; starting their own businesses voluntarily (as opposed to because firms won&#8217;t contract with an individual), and reaping the benefits of the ownership society.  This was the alleged basis for preferring the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/09/employment-growth-abuse-of-household.html">smaller, more subject to &#8220;population control&#8221; changes</a> household survey to the payroll survey when measuring unemployment. (See <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/employment-growth-payroll-survey-v.html">here</a> for a sample discussion.)</p>
<p>As noted in <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2006/11/employment-growth-payroll-survey-v.html">the sample discussion</a>, the household survey doesn&#8217;t jibe with Social Security payments. So we are left with the possibility that the income of those entrepreneurs is being maintained at their corporate level, for some reason.*</p>
<p>Which should mean that Corporate Tax <em>payments</em>, as a percentage of all corporate tax payments, would have also risen among the &#8220;new entrepreneurs.&#8221;
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SGBazp4sAwI/AAAAAAAAAII/NtFim0quvLU/s1600-h/Corporate+Tax+Liabilities.JPG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SGBazp4sAwI/AAAAAAAAAII/NtFim0quvLU/s400/Corporate+Tax+Liabilities.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>

<p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t look that way. I can&#8217;t find a single level of earnings that isn&#8217;t down at least 25% over the past ten years—and that&#8217;s the lowest quintile of earnings, not exactly the type of people you hear about being &#8220;success stories.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if you really think there are a lot of new S-corps out there, it appears that they&#8217;re either (1) in the group averaging more than $231,300 a year in income (see Table 1A), or (2) so poor that their tax bills are falling behind those paid by everyone else, and they&#8217;re clearly being irrational having a corporation in the first place.</p>
<p>Unless I&#8217;m missing something. If so, what?</p>
<p>*Since the highest marginal tax rate for individuals equals the corporate tax rate, that reason (especially for them levels, most of whom would not pay a marginal rate of 35%) is unlikely to be tax-related, except possibly as a matter of timing payments, which would not significantly alter a long-term trend.</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>In BusinessWeek, Jane Sasseen&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/bw/20080606/bs_bw/0824b4088081624555">Taxing the &#8216;Not-So-Rich&#8217; Rich</a>&#8221; tries to make me feel, uh, well, here&#8217;s the lede:<br />
<blockquote>By any measure, Dr. Howard Hammer and his wife, Hope, have a comfortable life. Hammer, 40, has built a thriving practice as an ear, nose, and throat specialist, while Hope, 39, has switched to part-time work as a real estate lawyer after years at a big firm in order to spend more time with [the kids]. Home is a four-bedroom house in the Philadelphia suburbs, and between them, they bring in over $300,000 a year. &#8220;We can&#8217;t complain,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;re certainly not struggling.&#8221;</p>
<p>But are they wealthy? That&#8217;s far more debatable&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Granted, income is a flow and wealth is a stock.  There&#8217;s nothing much beyond self-control that would prevent a family with a 97th-percentile income a la the Hammers from spending drunken sailors under the table (if perhaps in ways the drunken sailors would find dull), seeing as the modern economy&#8217;s undeniable talent is providing an array of goods and services capable of relieving anyone of their money for arbitrary values of &#8220;their money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, a regularity of the income-and-wealth data is that households with $300,000/year incomes also tend to be in high percentiles of the wealth distribution.  In the Fed&#8217;s <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/2004/scf2004home.html">2004 Survey of Consumer Finances</a>, for example, households in the 75th-90th percentile range for the wealth distribution had a median income of $77,000 (in 2004 dollars) and a mean income of $87,800.  So there&#8217;s some skew to the income distribution for people in that wealth fractile, but you can conclude that there aren&#8217;t too many people making $300,000/year who aren&#8217;t also in the top 10% of the wealth distribution.  At least, they&#8217;re for the most part rapidly on the way there.</p>
<p>And, sure enough, most people would probably be glad to have the financial stresses of the $300,000/year set:<br />
<blockquote>Ever-rising prices for gas, health insurance, and other expenses are hitting hard, as are the $3,000-a-month mortgage and the $2,000 he still pays monthly to whittle down his $160,000 medical school debt. A six-year residency gave Hammer a delayed start saving for retirement, so he worries if he&#8217;s stashing enough in his 401(k). By the time the couple contributes to the children&#8217;s college fund, there&#8217;s little extra at the end of the month.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s the horror of only having a little bit to save after socking away money for two of the main savings motives.  If they actually had to get to the point of curtailing their other savings, I&#8217;m quite sure that they could sharpen their pencils before their credit cards got maxed out.</p>
<p>Now you might recall that the upper-middle and upper classes did relatively well in that <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">long national nightmare of peace and prosperity</a> known as the Clinton (I) years.  However, Dr. Hammer would have us know that he&#8217;s not really a Republican but, he tells BW:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind paying my fair share, but people act like they&#8217;re just talking about Bill Gates,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We would definitely feel a hit if our taxes went up.&#8221; Although a year ago he would not have considered voting Republican in November, now he&#8217;s not so sure: &#8220;Do you vote your heart, or do you vote your wallet?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This looks like rather narrow pocketbook-voting insofar as Republican policies haven&#8217;t exactly helped with stuff like education, transportation, and health insurance prices and costs.  In a longer view the kids might be less than thankful for the taxes deferred to the next generation.  Perhaps Dr. Hammer is persuadable.</p>
<p>The BW piece seems to predict a major line of attack against Obama in the fall, namely that he&#8217;s planning the biggest middle-class tax increase EVER.  After all, a little rebranding (&#8220;death tax&#8221;) plus relentless marketing made a popular cause of relieving the super-rich of a tax burden nearly nobody is fortunate enough to bear, and if you&#8217;re a one-trick pony&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>But many also live in high-cost areas with expenses to match &#8212; and feel burned by talk of &#8220;taxing the rich&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t recognize that $250,000 stretches a lot further in the South or the Midwest than in Manhattan or Silicon Valley. &#8220;There is a huge difference between what politicians define as rich and what many Americans would call middle class,&#8221; says Patrick Anderson, CEO of the Anderson Economic Group and co-editor of The State Economic Handbook.</p>
<p>The soaring deficit, along with the fact that the Bush tax cuts expire at the end of 2010, provide much of the impetus for the coming fight over high-end taxes. If Washington doesn&#8217;t act, tax rates on income, capital gains, dividends, and other areas will return to the higher rates in effect before the cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003. Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.)&#8230; has said he would extend the cuts for everyone, while Obama says he&#8217;ll maintain them for all but the wealthiest. If Obama wins, some taxes could go up as soon as 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p>It falls to Austan Goolsbee to remind everyone that you can get &#8220;many&#8221; by multiplying small fractions and the population of the United States, and besides the far upper tail of the income distribution is the only group that&#8217;s systematically done well under Bushonomics:<br />
<blockquote>Austan Goolsbee, Obama&#8217;s top economic advisor, points out that only a relatively small number of high-end earners would be tapped, while the majority of Americans would see their taxes fall or remain the same. &#8220;Income growth in that group has been extremely rapid, while it&#8217;s been stagnant for everyone else,&#8221; says Goolsbee. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to argue they face the same struggle to get by.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>No kidding.  And the sob stories may even get a little much for Ms. Sasseen, who closes thusly:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;People think the President can just extend the cuts, but he can&#8217;t,&#8221; says Stanford Group&#8217;s [Anne] Mathias. All of which explains why Mathias has been warning her clients that the next couple of years &#8220;will be a very bad time to be rich.&#8221; Whatever, precisely, that means.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Both would benefit from a higher inflation index than CPI.  AEI hack (and former Social Security Administration commissioner!) Andrew Biggs redefines <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_drag#Bracket_creep">bracket creep</a> (*) for the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB121029420845179505.html?mod=opinion_main_commentaries">W$J op-ed page</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Tax revenues would skyrocket if the tax cuts expire, due to &#8220;bracket creep.&#8221; Average incomes are higher today than in the 1990s, but income-tax brackets aren&#8217;t adjusted for the growth of earnings. As a result, Americans will shift into higher tax brackets and pay a greater share of their incomes in taxes. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>Via <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/05/coming-tax-hike.html">Greg Mankiw</a>, who for inscrutable reasons calls this &#8220;reporting.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, tax brackets (with the notable exception of those of the Alternative Minimum Tax) now are indexed for growth in prices, at least to the extent that&#8217;s measured by CPI.  Really, this is part of a broader attack on progressive taxation, as you can see from an <a href="http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.12064/pub_detail.asp">earlier effort along these lines</a> by AEI über-hack Kevin Hassett of Dow 36,000 fame.  Though I suppose there may be some positive side effects for society if the AEI&#8217;s paymasters had to allow enough trickle-down to keep average wage growth ahead of CPI.</p>
