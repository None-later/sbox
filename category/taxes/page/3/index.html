<p>Corporatism and taxes
<p>Corporatism is the term used to describe a economic and governmental approach that favors large entities over people, including adopting rules and regulations to suit the regulated entities, tilting legislation to protect corporate entities that might otherwise be considered to be causing harm to the public good, and allowing access to public fora and public representatives in ways that ensures that corporate voices are heard, whether or not those opposing them are heard.</p>
<p>Corporatism in tax policy has resulted in highly favorable readings of the reorganization provisions&#8211;for example, current IRS regulatory approaches proclaim that even losses can be recognized in corporate reorgs, going against well-settled understandings of the operation of the corporate reorganization provisions, and the Code and regulations permit a vastly expanded range of flexible transactions, especially of spins under section 355 and of A reorgs (a mere 40% equity consideration now &#8216;counts&#8217; as sufficient to provide tax-free reorganization status). </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Corporatism has been around in one form or another for a long time, but it was immensely aided by the activism of organizations like the US Chamber of Commerce and the National association of Manufacturers and the ideological &#8216;think-tanks&#8217; supported by them and by corporate and wealthy backers. </p>
<p>For a revealing slice of the history of corporatism, every reader should be familiar with Lewis Powell&#8217;s 1971 memo on the means by which business could take over government.  It is given a thorough airing (and there&#8217;s a link to the memo itself) by William Black on the blog New Economic Perspectives, <a href="http://neweconomicperspectives.blogspot.com/2011/04/my-class-right-or-wrong-powell.html">My Class Right or Wrong: the Power memorandum&#8217;s 40th Anniversary</a> (April 25, 2011).</p>

<p>An organization that is called: <a href="http://www.certifiedtaxcoach.org/blog/gop-tax-proposals/">American Institute of Certified Tax Coaches</a> has put up a summary graphic of the various tax proposals ofthe GOP candidates.   It not only notes the major points of their plans, but what their plans would cost.</p>
<p>It is presented in a sort of game board race layout.  The Institute introduces it thusly:
<div>
<blockquote>The US tax code is so complexeven those who write the law don’t understand all of it.  Infact, few members of Congress prepare their annual tax returnsaccording to a survey by the congressional newspaper, “The Hill.” Politicians cite the complexity of the tax code as the primary reasonleading them to turn to professionals for help.  Even theCommissioner of the IRS can’t prepare his own tax returns! </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Ask most taxpayers and theyagree our current system is too complicated and unfair. So there’sno easier way for a politician to gain approval than to say thecurrent system should be eliminated. </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p></p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It’s no surprise theRepublican presidential candidates have come out with somewide-ranging tax proposals.  Even deciphering the content ofthese plans can be a challenge, so we took it upon ourselves toidentify how the GOP hopefuls’ differ and just what is in them.</p></blockquote>

<p>   Ian Ayres on the Brandeis Tax</p>
<p>  I&#8217;ve often argued here that vast inequality is harmful to democracy, and that the kind of unequal society that we have today, reflected the Gilded Age of yore, is especially worrisome.  Much of what is happening in this country that threatens freedom and economic suffering for many is related to the vastly unequal incomes and wealth of the top 1% compared to the rest of us.  Oligarchy finds it easy to flourish in such a society, and democracy struggles to keep its head above water.  The corporatist agenda that favors big business (and its owners) facilitates the capture of the state for the benefit of the rich&#8211;lobbyists swarm legislators, and campaign funding by corporations floods the airwaves with repetitive (and hence believed even if untrue) messages favoring corporatist allies. </p>
<p>The main defenses that a society has against such developments are twofold:  1) a strong sense of community that incentivizes the uberrich to give a good bit of their wealth away to help the community and 2) a strong tax system&#8211;especially estate taxes and other taxes that fall primarily or exclusively on the uberrich as a way of skimming off the excess rents they have acquired because of their status and unrelated to genuine merit or hard work.  {As Elizabeth Warren said, nobody can claim to have earned all they earn without the help of the state, and the wealthy in particular depend on the state to protect their property and even their status.)  Hence I talk here of democratic egalitarianism and my view that equilibrium is not a realistic state so redistribution is always occuring.  Most redistribution will be &#8216;upwards&#8217; for the benefit of those at the top, unless democratic institutions push for a rebalancing redistribution &#8216;downwards&#8217; to assist those in the middle and lower income groups.</p>
<p>Ian Ayres has a series of postings on a proposed &#8220;Brandeis&#8221; tax intended to impose limitations on the inequality gap.    <br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/opinion/dont-tax-the-rich-tax-inequality-itself.html">Don&#8217;t tax the rich, tax inequality itself</a>, New York Times, Op-Ed, Dec. 18, 2011.<br />
<blockquote>In 1980, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans made 9.1 percent of our nation’s pre-tax income; by 2006 that share had risen to 18.8 percent — slightly higher than when Brandeis joined the Supreme Court in 1916.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>Congress might have countered this increased concentration but, instead, tax changes have exacerbated the trend: in after-tax dollars, our wealthiest 1 percent over this same period went from receiving 7.7 percent to 16.3 percent of our nation’s income.<br />What we call the Brandeis Ratio — the ratio of the average income of the nation’s richest 1 percent to the median household income — has skyrocketed since Ronald Reagan took office. In 1980 the average 1-percenter made 12.5 times the median income, but in 2006 (the latest year for which data is available) the average income of our richest 1 percent was a whopping 36 times greater than that of the median household.<br />Brandeis understood that at some point the concentration of economic power could undermine the democratic requisite of dispersed political power. This concern looms large in today’s America, where billionaires are allowed to spend unlimited amounts of money on their own campaigns or expressly advocating the election of others.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>The vast shift in national income toward our richest 1 percent is especially vivid if their income is expressed in terms of the median household income. Indeed, an important goal of our op-ed was to suggest a new unit of measure, “medians” to help us think about what it means to be rich. In 1980, if you earned 3.8 medians, you were in the top 1 percent, but by 2006 even the poorest in the 1 percent club earned 6.9 medians. <br />What we call the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/19/opinion/dont-tax-the-rich-tax-inequality-itself.html?ref=opinion">“Brandeis Ratio,”</a> the <em>average</em> income of the richest 1 percent (which includes the billions earned by the lucky few) has grown even more disproportionate. As shown in the chart below, in 1980, one-percenters on average made 12.5 medians, but in 2006 (the latest year in which data is available) the average income of our richest 1 percent was a whopping 36 medians.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>A central idea behind our Brandeis tax proposal was to have a tax that is triggered by increases in inequality. Our Brandeis tax does not target excessive income per se; it only caps inequality. Billionaires could double their current income without the tax kicking in — as long as the median income also doubles. The sky is the limit for the rich as long as the “rising tide lifts all boats.” Indeed, the tax gives job creators an extra reason to make sure that corporate wealth does in fact trickle down.<br />***<br />As emphasized by <strong>Lawrence Lessig</strong> in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Republic-Lost-Money-Corrupts-Congress/dp/0446576433"><em>Republic, Lost</em></a><em> </em>(presaged somewhat in Ayres’ book with <strong>Bruce Ackerman</strong>, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Voting-Dollars-Paradigm-Campaign-Finance/dp/0300092628"><em>Voting With Dollars</em></a>), the bulk of campaign finance dollars comes disproportionately from not just the 1% club, but the richest one-half of one-percenters.  Focusing on the average income of one-percenters is a good proxy for the rising political power of plutocrats.</p></blockquote>

<div>A week or so back, Dan from <i>Angry Bear</i> passed along <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/18/two-communities-are-worlds-apart/6RZboLZCxK7VWrm6Y7xURO/story.html">this</a><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/18/two-communities-are-worlds-apart/6RZboLZCxK7VWrm6Y7xURO/story.html"> </a><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/18/two-communities-are-worlds-apart/6RZboLZCxK7VWrm6Y7xURO/story.html"><i>Boston</i></a><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/18/two-communities-are-worlds-apart/6RZboLZCxK7VWrm6Y7xURO/story.html"><i> </i></a><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/18/two-communities-are-worlds-apart/6RZboLZCxK7VWrm6Y7xURO/story.html"><i>Globe</i></a><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/18/two-communities-are-worlds-apart/6RZboLZCxK7VWrm6Y7xURO/story.html"><i> </i></a><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/18/two-communities-are-worlds-apart/6RZboLZCxK7VWrm6Y7xURO/story.html">article</a>. On its face, the article bemoans rising inequality through a comparison of two Massachusetts neighborhoods: Sherborn, the State’s wealthiest neighborhood and Springfield, a former working-class neighborhood that now resembles a <a href="http://youtu.be/LEzXln5kbuw?t=50s">globalized</a><a href="http://youtu.be/LEzXln5kbuw?t=50s"> </a><a href="http://youtu.be/LEzXln5kbuw?t=50s">ghost</a><a href="http://youtu.be/LEzXln5kbuw?t=50s"> </a><a href="http://youtu.be/LEzXln5kbuw?t=50s">town</a>.

<div>And keep in mind, that’s 1980s dollars. Given the scandalous increases that have gone to the top 1% since then, the amount required to be a player these days is several times that amount. And the problem with that kind of concentration of wealth is that it inevitably undermines the incentive for collective action required for social well being. </div>

<div></div>
<div>The very rich on today’s Wall Street are now so rich that they buy their own social infrastructure. They hire private security, they live in gated mansions on islands and other tax havens, and most notably, they buy their own justice and their own government.</div>
<div></div>

<div></div>
<div>Most of us 99-percenters couldn’t even let our dogs leave a dump on the sidewalk without feeling ashamed before our neighbors&#8230;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>But our Too-Big-To-Fail banks unhesitatingly take billions in bailout money and then turn right around and finance the export of jobs to new locations in China and India. They defraud the pension funds of state workers into buying billions of their crap mortgage assets. They take zero-interest loans from the state and then lend that same money back to us at interest. Or, like Chase, they bribe the politicians serving countries and states and cities and even school boards to take on crippling debt deals.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Nobody with real skin in the game, who had any kind of stake in our collective future, would do any of those things. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Nobel Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz made the same point in May of 2011 (well before Occupy Wall Street), in a must-read <i>Vanity Fair</i> piece entitled, <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105">“</a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105">Of</a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105"> </a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105">the</a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105"> 1%, </a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105">by</a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105"> </a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105">the</a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105"> 1%, </a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105">for</a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105"> </a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105">the</a><a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/society/features/2011/05/top-one-percent-201105"> 1%”</a>:</div>
<div></div>
<div>[A] modern economy requires “collective action”—it needs government to invest in infrastructure, education, and technology&#8230;. America has long suffered from an under-investment in infrastructure (look at the condition of our highways and bridges, our railroads and airports), in basic research, and in education at all levels. Further cutbacks in these areas lie ahead.</div>
<div></div>
<div>None of this should come as a surprise—it is simply what happens when a society’s wealth distribution becomes lopsided. The more divided a society becomes in terms of wealth, the more reluctant the wealthy become to spend money on common needs. The rich don’t need to rely on government for parks or education or medical care or personal security—they can buy all these things for themselves. In the process, they become more distant from ordinary people, losing whatever empathy they may once have had. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Be clear: This is who Occupy Wall Street is talking about &#8211; the small class of people who have amassed so much wealth that they have no need for the social infrastructure that is the life blood of the 99% (even the 99 percenters who live in swank neighborhoods like Sherborn, Massachusets). </div>
<div></div>
<div>And suggesting that Sherborn is the 1% and Springfield is the 99% &#8211; when they’re both the 99% &#8211; seems designed to falsely frame the problem of inequality as the poor (Springfield) versus the well-to-do (Sherborn). Of course, in the realm of those set on denying or deflecting inequality concerns, improperly defining the opponents of the 99% is fairly mild. (See discussions of income-inequality deniers <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/01/income-and-wealth-alan-reynolds-is-not.html">here</a> and <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/06/the-income-ineq.html">here</a>). However, this particular sleight of hand has made more than one appearance of late and therefore, is worth reviewing a bit more closely. </div>

<div>Actually he didn&#8217;t complain about his lack of access to data, but he probably should have given the column he wrote today.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let me just pause for a moment to say: Snap! Good on Dean Baker for pointing out that Brooks’s argument flat-out ignores well-known inequality data. Alright, back to Baker: </div>
<div></div>
<div>Brooks purports to lecture the Occupy Wall Street crew about how they are focused on the wrong inequality.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He tells them that that there are two inequalities in the U.S. On the one hand we have the CEOs, the Goldman Sachs crew, the lobbyists and the other members of the one percent who have done incredibly well in the last three decades. Brooks calls this the &#8220;blue inequality&#8221;&#8230;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Brooks tells us that this is less of a big deal than the red inequality, which he defines as the gap between college educated workers and those without a college degree&#8230;.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is where Brooks lack of access to data is so important&#8230;. </div>
<div></div>

<div></div>
<div>Despite the blatant lack of empirical support and Dean Baker’s decisive take down, <a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/11/the-great-work-divide/248931/">Megan</a><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/11/the-great-work-divide/248931/"> </a><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/11/the-great-work-divide/248931/">McArdle</a> dutifully picked up on the trope. And, of course, the <a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/18/two-communities-are-worlds-apart/6RZboLZCxK7VWrm6Y7xURO/story.html"><i>Boston</i></a><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/18/two-communities-are-worlds-apart/6RZboLZCxK7VWrm6Y7xURO/story.html"><i> </i></a><a href="http://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2011/12/18/two-communities-are-worlds-apart/6RZboLZCxK7VWrm6Y7xURO/story.html"><i>Globe</i></a> piece highlights the education gap between the residents of Springfield and Sherborn and implies the gap between two communities is the result of the “one percent phenomenon.” However, these arguments &#8211; and, more often, implications &#8211; are clearly undercut by the data. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The mega rich Occupy Wall Street opposes do not live in “neighborhoods,” not even well-to-do neighborhoods like Sherborn. The top 1% &#8211; and probably more accurately the top .1% &#8211; live in gated mansions with private security. As Joseph Stiglitz and Matt Taibbi have pointed out, the mega rich have reached a level of wealth that completely insulates them from society. So, don’t be fooled: Occupy Wall Street is not opposed to the affluent. Residents of Sherborn and similar affluent communities &#8211; like all citizens who still have a stake in our country’s well being &#8211; are part of the 99%. </div>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/12/gingrich-tax-plan-starves-government-feeds-the-wealthy.html">Gingrich tax &#8216;plan&#8217; starves government, feeds the wealthy, rests on flawed assumptions</a>
<p>In case you hadn&#8217;t heard about it, Gingrich would offer taxpayers a choice to pay tax under current policy or at a 15% rate, with zero taxation of capital gains, dividends and interest that accrues mostly to the rich and uberrich, while corporate tax rate would be reduced to a mere 12.5%.  For the rich, the 15% rate on their ordinary income and the 0% rate on their predominant form of income (capital gains and income from capital) would be a windfall.  For corporations, it would practically amount to the elimination of the corporate tax.  It should be no surprise that tax revenues would decline substantially: the <a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/numbers/displayatab.cfm?Docid=3252&#038;DocTypeID=2">Tax Policy Center study of Gingrich&#8217;s plan</a>estimates by $1.3 trillion over a decade.  While the lower two quintiles would get an average tax cut of about $440, the top 1% (starting at incomes of about $629,000) would get an average $344,000 cut and the top 0.1% (starting at incomes of about 2.868 million) an average $1.9 million cut.  Id. </p>

<p>See also <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/study-gingrich-tax-plan-would-provide-big-breaks-for-rich-blow-huge-hole-in-budget-deficit/2011/12/12/gIQAfHiJqO_story.html">Study: Gingrich Plan would provide big breaks for rich, blow huge hole in budget deficit</a>, Washington Post (December 12, 2011); Rubin et al, <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-12-12/gingrich-plan-yields-deep-tax-cuts-for-top-earners-study-finds.html">Gingrich Plan to Add $1.3 trillion to Deficit, Study Finds</a>, Bloomberg (Dec. 12, 2011).</p>
<p>Gingrich&#8217;s rationale is one that the right-wing American Enterprise Institute strongly supports&#8211;the tired old reaganomics rationale that eliminating taxes on capital will create new investments.  See, e.g., <a href="http://blog.american.com/2011/12/why-romney-is-wrong-and-gingrich-is-right-on-capital-gains-taxes/">Why Romney is Wrong and Gingrich is Right on Capital Gains Taxes</a>, AEI ( Dec. 12, 2011).  This theory is hogwash&#8211;lowering the return on investment by the piddling tax (whether 15% or 20%) will not keep folks from investing.  Folks will still make profits and they will still invest those profits, even if they have to pay taxes.  Paying no tax on dividends and capital gains won&#8217;t make the rich suddenly invest in entreprenuerial activities, my friends.  (Simply trading corporate stocks on the secondary market is not, by the way, entrepreneurial.)</p>
<p>The Gingrich website also objects that this plan is really good for everybody.</p>
<blockquote><p>An optional flat tax reform will be simple: Tax returns can be done on one sheet of paper,” the website says. “Subtract from income a standard deduction and deductions for charity and home ownership, multiply the result by the fixed, single rate of taxation of at most 15 percent, and the process is over.”  Wash. Post, above (quoting the website).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Folks, the hardest part of the income tax is figuring out whether you have income and how it is characterized (capital or ordinary).  Neither of those two difficulties disappears under Gingrich&#8217;s system.  Furthermore, ordinary fold really don&#8217;t have a very difficult time with their tax returns&#8211;they have wage income (withheld against), report the standard deduction and personal exemptions, and get a refund of part of the amount withheld.  The appeal to simplicity is a cover for the real purpose&#8211;to provide an unprecedented tax break to the wealthiest Americans at a time when the right is targeting Medicare and Social Security for cuts.  This is just one more example of class warfare from the right wing.</p>

<p>Peter Diamond, Emmanuel Saez, Paul Krugman and Me!!  Looking at Optimal Tax Rates</p>
<p>Via <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/22/taxing-job-creators/">Paul Krugman</a>, I learned of <a href="http://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.25.4.165">this paper</a> by Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez.  Diamond, of course, is a Nobel Laureate.  I will be shocked if Saez isn&#8217;t one too in ten or fifteen years.</p>
<p>Long story made very short, Diamond and Saez jump through a lot of hoops and find that the optimal top marginal income tax rate (all in, that is, including federal, state and local), which they define as maximizing social welfare, is about 73%.  </p>
<p>Now, long time readers may recall I&#8217;ve been doing this sort of analysis for years, though of course I&#8217;ve been looking at tax rates that maximize real GDP growth.  Simply put, you cannot maximize long run social welfare if you aren&#8217;t maximizing economic growth.  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />My approach is much simpler than that followed by Diamond and Saez.  I like to think its much more intuitive and easier to explain.  I note that US data shows a simple quadratic relationship between real GDP growth from one year to the next and tax rates:</p>
<p>growth in real GDP, t to t+1 = f(top marginal tax rate, top marginal tax rate squared, other variables)</p>
<p>One recent post on the topic is <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/top-marginal-income-tax-rate-should-be.html">here</a>.   (<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">Unlike the Laffer curve</a>, the coefficients come out statistically significant and with the right signs.)  </p>
<p>I mention all this to note that no matter what I throw into the equation, I find that the top marginal tax rate that maximizes economic growth is somewhere around 65%.  Of course, I&#8217;ve focused only on federal tax rates&#8230; add in state and local it comes pretty close to what Diamond and Saez have found.</p>
<p>As I noted above, my approach is somewhat simpler, and easier to follow than that of Diamond and Saez.  Part of the reason is that they come at it from a point of view of elasticities.  But with all due respect to my betters (Diamond and Saez, and Krugman as well considering the explanation in his post) I think this is the wrong way to consider the problem.  It requires all sorts of assumptions and generalizations about people&#8217;s behavior, some of which are both false and create resistance from folks on the right.  </p>
<p>For example, there is a notion that raising tax rates will reduce people&#8217;s willingness to work&#8230; which is only true above certain thresholds.  (That threshold, of course, varies per individual.)  As anyone who has ever had a business will tell you (when they&#8217;re not busy demanding tax reductions), you don&#8217;t pay taxes on income from the business if you turn around and reinvest that income.  (An accountant would talk to you about decreasing your tax liability by increasing expenses which amounts to the same thing.)  You only pay taxes on that income you take that income out, presumably for consumption purposes.</p>
<p>So to simplify, consider an example&#8230;.  is a successful businessperson more likely to take money out of the business if his/her tax rate is 70% or if its 25%?  In general, a person is more likely to take that money at 25%, as there&#8217;s less of a penalty.  At 70% tax rates, there is more of an incentive to reinvest in the business, creating more growth in the business in subsequent years, and more economic growth thereafter.  70% tax rates are more likely to generate faster economic growth than 25% tax rates precisely because people are self-interested and the higher tax rates induce people to continue investing in things they do well.</p>
<p>(Of course, tax rates can get too high.  At 95%, people will reinvest almost every dime&#8230; even if they have exhausted every good investment opportunity they have.  Thus, to avoid taxes they&#8217;ll be making lousy investments which in turn slow economic growth.)  </p>
<p>Still, its gratifying to see others who are more, er, credentialed doing similar work.  If I might end on a digression, though, I can think of a number of examples of work being done on blogs by people who are essentially hobbyists which is somewhat ahead of the academic literature.  However, to a large extent, if something wasn&#8217;t published in the academic literature, for all practical purposes it didn&#8217;t happen.  Which is a shame, because most of us who aren&#8217;t academics don&#8217;t have time or the resources required for such publication (such as access to econlit).  That inevitably slows economic development three ways:</p>
<p>1.  the lack of recognition discourages hobbyists who have the potential and otherwise would have the willingness to improve on the existing literature<br />2.  should such hobbyists persist and do the research, that research will not be widely disseminated even if it is an improvement over the academic literature<br />3.  it maintains an insular attitude among those who are not hobbyists.  As smart as Diamond, Saez, and Krugman all are, none of them are thinking the way someone running a business thinks of they&#8217;d have realized immediately how people who are running a business react to higher and lower tax rates.  I have read a lot of academic papers on taxation and have yet to stumble on one that gets it right.</p>

<p>And since I always offer&#8230;  if anyone wants any spreadsheets showing the quadratic relationship between tax rates and economic growth or anything else I&#8217;ve done, drop me a line.

<p>GOP two-step approach problematic
<p>Discussion continued apace yesterday about the &#8220;supercommittee&#8221; and the idea of agreeing to agree someday on some revenue increases while going ahead with cuts.</p>
<p>This approach is a terrible one since it gives the obstructionist GOP members just another setting in which to refuse to go ahead with tax increases and to &#8220;negotiate&#8221; yet again over just what counts as a revenue increase.  Like the gimmicks that became so overused in the 2001, 2003, 2004 Bush tax bills, this &#8220;deal&#8221; is just another gimmick for the radical right to get its way&#8211;cuts to Social Security and Medicare, cuts to all programs intended to help the vulnerable, no cuts to military programs, and no tax increases&#8211;especially not for the rich.</p>
<p>Republicans on the right are already arguing for applying &#8220;dynamic analysis&#8221; which tends, in their versions, to be rosy scenarios of increased growth due to tax cuts:  <a name="more"></a> this is a cop-out way to claim revenue increases that won&#8217;t materialize while making actual cuts to much needed social programs.  They are also arguing for dramatic changes in the way the earned benefits programs work&#8211;such as means-testing for recipients&#8211;as first steps in working towards outright elimination of those programs.  You get comments like those of Jim Jordan (Republican of Ohio) who wrote in an op-ed in USA Today that taxes &#8220;should not punish success to satisfy some false definition of balance.&#8221;  See Rubin,  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-14/debt-accord-may-be-two-step-process-hensarling-says.html">Debt Accord May be Two-Step Process, Hensarling Says</a>, Bloomberg (Nov. 14, 2011).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jim Jordan (Republican of Ohio) said in a USA Today piece that taxes should not be raised because they &#8220;should not punish success to satisfy some false definition of balance.&#8221;  Id. </p>
<p>This is a wrongheaded view of taxes.  The radical right uses language about taxes &#8220;punishing success&#8221; because they see defending the rich from  taxation as their mission.  The rich are defined as &#8220;successful&#8221;&#8211;even if the wealth is merely built on top of inherited wealth and position, and even if the rich did nothing at all to earn the wealth.  Taxes do not punish success.  Taxes are the way that we cooperate together to fund important government programs that serve all of us.  Even when they act as transfer programs that transfer resources to the poor and elderly, they are serving all of us by making our society work better. </p>

<p>Infrastructure gamesmanship puts wealthy ahead of jobs, good bridges, and country
<p>For those who are paying attention to the House and Senate these days, it seems like a frustrating exercise.  Mostly it is one of watching the &#8220;do-nothing&#8221; Republicans find excuses for never requiring millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes while making up excuses for not doing anything of the varied real approaches to stimulating the economy in ways that will create jobs for ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>Take the vote on the infrastructure bills.  The Senate leadership asked the Senate to vote for funding $60 billion of much needed infrastructure projects (just a tip of the iceberg of everything that is needed to bring this country&#8217;s infrastructure into nonembarassment).  The GOP refused, because it was funded by a de minimis tax on millionaires. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no end to things that can be said about this further evidence of the craven state of the GOP in the US today.  Political advantage for the wealthy class is to be given primary importance, no matter what happens to the vast majority of Americans and the country we all love.  Jim Maule has it right, in <a href="http://www.mauledagain.blogspot.com/">The Tax and Spending Stalemate: Can It Destroy the Nation?</a>, MauledAgain (Nov. 7, 2011).</p>
<p>  <a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>
<p>When partisan loyalties mean more than the nation’s well-being, when money means more to wealthy “world citizens” than does the long-term physical security of the nation, and when protection of millionaires who fund campaign treasure chests means more than the lives and safety of the rest of America, the literal physical survival of the nation is imperiled. &#8230;</p>
<p>[A]s long as this absurd tax and spending stalemate continues, where decisions are not made on the merits of the issue but on the partisan attachments of supposedly public servants, the nation and its infrastructure, the nation and the health of its citizens, the nation and its economy, will continue to stagnate, deteriorate, and crumble. The question now is how close we are to the point of no return.</p>

<p><strong>A Post:  Tax Burdens, Presidents, and Subsequent Economic Growth &#8211; A Few Pictures, Part 1</strong></p>
<p>Last week I had a post looking at the relationship between <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/presidents-tax-burdens-and-subsequent.html">the change in the tax burden in the first two years of a Presidential administration and the growth of real GDP during the remaining years of the administration</a>.  I&#8217;ve done variations of this exercise before.  It turns out that the more an administration reduced the tax burden in its first two years, the slower the growth the in real GDP over the remainder of its term in office administration.  Assuming the result is more than an artifact of the data (and it does seem to correspond with other results I&#8217;ve reported here over the years), it requires an explanation.  While (I am not happy to report) an increased tax burden <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/12/simple-explanation-for-strange-paradox.html">might in and of itself stimulate faster economic growth</a>, I suspect a bigger effect is that a) the easiest way to move the tax burden is by increasing or decreasing tax regulation and b) there is a correlation between an administration&#8217;s views on tax regulations and its views on other regulations that are intended to prevent externalities.   This theory is supported by the fact that the relationship between lower tax burdens and slower growth is strengthened by not including the administrations that served only four rather than eight years makes the relationship stronger.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>As I keep noting, one doesn&#8217;t have to like the results.  I personally would much prefer a world in which lower tax burdens do lead to faster economic growth.  But the data doesn&#8217;t seem to show that.  Still, every time I put up a post like this, I get a lot of flack.  One thing people keep telling me is that the results are, at best, a coincidence.  In their honor, in today&#8217;s post I&#8217;m going to describe a few more coincidences that the data shows in my next few posts.  Some of these coincidences I expected to see, and some, to be frank, I did not.  Today I&#8217;m going to stick with a few coincidences I expected.</p>
<p>So&#8230;  let&#8217;s go with coincidence number one. The graph below shows the change in the tax burden from Year 0 (i.e., the last full year of the prior administration) to Year 2 on one axis, and the growth rate in the last full year of each administration.  (Only eight year administrations are included.)  As an example, for Ronald Reagan, we see the change in the tax burden from 1980 to 1982 along one axis and the percentage change from the 1987 real GDP to the 1988 real GDP.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7RNRhtKqqLc/ThrMTwrhaBI/AAAAAAAAAqU/fqqQYQet0G4/s1600/Follow-up_figure_1.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7RNRhtKqqLc/ThrMTwrhaBI/AAAAAAAAAqU/fqqQYQet0G4/s320/Follow-up_figure_1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 1</p>
<p>Notice that the relationship between the tax burden in the first two years of each administration and the growth rate in its last year is extremely strong.  That&#8217;s consistent with what I wrote in my last post (and so many times before):  most administrations do not change their tax policy very much, but tax policy (and other policies that correlate with tax policy) can take a while to have an effect on the economy. </p>
<p>Before I go on, a few ground rules for those who want to comment or send me e-mail: <br />1.  If you really believe that the growth rate in the last year of an administration is &#8220;causing&#8221; the change in the tax burden in the beginning of the administration, I encourage you to seek psychiatric help.  I can&#8217;t do anything for you.<br />2.  US&#8217; participation in World War 2 prior to 1940 is best described as peripheral.  Growth in 1940, or 1939, or 1934 for that matter, is not due to World War 2.  </p>
<p>(If you find my constant repetition of these ground rules funny, hazard a guess as to what creeps into my inbox.)  </p>
<p>Now, another coincidence&#8230;  the next figure shows the the change in the tax burden from Year 0 (i.e., the last full year of the prior administration) to Year 2 on one axis, and the growth rate in the fourth year of each administration. </p>

<p>Again&#8230; the picture looks an awful like Figure 1.  The fit isn&#8217;t as good (consistent with the idea that it takes a while for policy to have a a very strong effect.  Kind of odd for a coincidence.</p>
<p>Now&#8230; you may be wondering&#8230; what about other years.  I&#8217;ll tell you flat out, the fits in years 1 and 2 are awful&#8230; consistent with the idea that it takes a while for policy to have a very strong effect.  As to the rest, that will wait for the next post.</p>
<p>To close, nominal and real GDP come from the <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/xls/gdplev.xls">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>.  GDP was first computed in 1929, so the first complete administration for which we have data is FDR I.  Data on the Federal government&#8217;s tax receipts comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis&#8217; <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/SelectTable.asp?Selected=N#S3">NIPA Table 3.2</a>.</p>

                                <p>Op ed by <strong>Nancy Ortiz</strong></p>
<p>Scott Hochberg&#8217;s article <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/making-e-verify-mandatory-perfect-storm.html">Making E-Verify Mandatory: The Perfect Storm for Crippling the Social Security Administration and Jeopardizing the Social Safety Net</a> discusses issues regarding the e-Verify system and a move in Congress to make it mandatory for everyone hired for a job in the US. He points out that eVerify is every bit as much a threat to SS and Medicare as any of the other benefit, COLA, or Medicare provider cuts now being discussed. I read Hochberg&#8217;s article with great interest and have a few additional points to add to his excellent analysis of this subject.  </p>
<p>When the Immigration Reform Act took effect in 1987, I was the manager of the SS office in Northern Santa Barbara County in strawberry, broccoli, lettuce and wine grape country. Thousands of migrant workers pass through the area at the height of the picking season between January and May. Many stay with or without authorization so that about 60% of the population is Hispanic and/or non-English speaking/non-US national. You will find similar demographics up and down the California Central Coast in agricultural areas, so there&#8217;s nothing unusual about this.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>I&#8217;ll spare you the war stories of actually implementing IRCA&#8217;s social security number provisions. This was the Bush I administration notable for its parsimony in budgeting for SSA operations. (How bad was it? How about no hiring, no overtime and no photocopy paper bad?) Farm workers in the area lined up with their new Immigration work visas in hand outside our office door at 6:00A and we interviewed Social Security Number applicants until 5:00P every day from 1987 til mid-1989. It was hard to get anything else done, but the normal operation got busier because of the recession that put maybe 15% of the workforce in our area out of work.</p>
<p>Alright, now it won&#8217;t take much imagination to imagine the same situation but worse, because now every worker  would be subject to e-verify. Not just the &#8220;obvious illegals,&#8221; every single one who applied for a job. Hochberg&#8217;s article summarizes the projected workload from this but SSA&#8217;s workforce is now 20 or more years older <br />and really, really ready to retire. And, of course, Congress is talking about cutting the whole federal civil service workforce 10% across the board while maintaining an indefinite hiring freeze and whacking every agencies&#8217; budget in its 2 Trillion to 4 Trillion dollar spending cuts. The President is ready to agree to at least 2 Trillion in cuts, but discussions are continuing.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can see now why making it illegal to work in the US without lawful admission was a bad, terrible, awful, rotten, really bad idea from the git-go. &#8220;All we would have to do to&#8221; avoid this debacle is revoke this provision and we could go back to doing business the way we did before 1987. The punitive notion of making<br />work without documents a &#8220;crime&#8221; has resulted in a flood of counterfeit and stolen documents. Field workers often buy many sets of documents (at high prices) before getting a set that will pass employers&#8217; inspection. Every town in California and other border states has document mills.  Sanctions against employers for hiring undocumented workers are virtually never imposed. Identity theft, impossible to prevent and prosecute effectively, is epidemic. And, on and on. All because of the notion that working in the US should be a crime.</p>
<p>If you remain unconvinced, let me remind you that the budget for SSA&#8217;s New New Computer Center was reduced about in this last round of spending cuts. This will make it impossible to meet an early construction deadline made necessary by the fragility of the existing computer system. This is estimated to result in causing SSA&#8217;s now aged and outdated computer processing and data storage systems to collapse<br />sometime between now and 2013. 2013 is supposedly the outside range of functionality assuming nothing catastrophic (such as a major power grid black out) happens between now and then. Otherwise, it can go at any time. Finally, I don&#8217;t need to remind you of the pending DIB appeals workload of approx. 700K cases still on hand.</p>
<p>But, in closing let me ask you&#8211;can you prove you are a US citizen or lawfully admitted alien with permission to work if I ask you right this minute? No, your drivers&#8217; license isn&#8217;t enough. Your SS card isn&#8217;t ID.  You may have a US Passport but it won&#8217;t resolve the matter unless it is current. Your current or former employer&#8217;s assurance isn&#8217;t enough either.</p>
<p>Prove to me who you are or you can&#8217;t work here any more. And, it says here on this little No Match notice that you aren&#8217;t who you say you are. So, what about it? Exactly who are you anyway, Mr. Working American?</p>
