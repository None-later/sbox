                                <p>PGL, in the process of <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2011/06/payroll-taxes-as-stimulus-speaker.html">an optimistic piece</a>, points us to <a href="http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/martin-feldstein-whats-good-about-us-tax-package/420128/#">Martin Feldstein ringing in 2011</a>. Apparently, the reason is this:<br />
<blockquote>The most substantial potential boost to spending comes from a temporary reduction of the payroll tax, lowering the rate paid by employees on income up to about $100,000 from 6.2 per cent to 4.2 per cent. But, while the decline in tax payments will be about 0.8 per cent of GDP, it is not clear how much of this will translate into additional consumer spending and how much into additional saving. Because this tax cut will take the form of lower withholding from weekly or monthly wages, it may seem more permanent than it really is, and therefore has a greater impact on spending than households’ very feeble response to the previous temporary tax changes.</p></blockquote>
<p>Feldstein attempts a free-finesse with &#8220;it may seem more permanent than it really is.&#8221; This is like playing the seven to the Queen when you&#8217;re only other holding is 10-x and expecting it to work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s six months later. The crowd jewel of BarryO&#8217;s deficit-saving agreement, per Feldstein, was a low-impact change that was mostly (if my paycheck is any indication) neutralized by other factors (such as increases in health insurance costs). So the payroll cut is going to UHC or Aetna, or BCBS, or some other place where the money multiplier will be significantly less than one.</p>
<p>Even more interesting is that, just three paragraphs before, Feldstein understood that workers are still engaged in balance-sheet repair, and the likely consequences of same:<br />
<blockquote>Even for those taxpayers who had feared a tax increase in 2011 and 2012, it is not clear how much the lower tax payments will actually boost consumer spending. The previous temporary tax cuts in 2008 and 2009 appear to have gone largely into saving and debt reduction rather than increased spending.</p>
<p>It is surprising, therefore, that forecasters raised their GDP growth forecasts for 2011 significantly on the basis of the tax agreement.</p></blockquote>
<p>But Feldstein did see some good in the greater tax deal—it would temper deficit fears:<br />
<blockquote>Obama wanted to continue the 2010 tax rates permanently for all taxpayers except those with annual incomes over $250,000&#8230;.By agreeing to limit the current tax rates for just two years, the tax package reduces the projected national debt at the end of the decade (relative to what it would have been with the Obama Budget) by some $2 trillion or nearly 10 per cent of GDP in 2020.</p>
<p>That reduction in potential deficits and debt can by itself give a boost to the economy in 2011 <em>by calming fears that an exploding national debt</em> would eventually force the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates — perhaps sharply if foreign buyers of US Treasuries suddenly became frightened by the deficit prospects.</p></blockquote>
<p>There can be only one remaining question:</p>
<p>When will Martin Feldstein <a href="http://www.lawyersgunsmoneyblog.com/2011/06/wrongness-you-can-count-on">endorse Jon Hunstman for President</a>?</p>

<p>We tax profs have a tendency to tell our colleagues that tax law should be a mandatory topic for all law students because there&#8217;s nothing that you do that has economic consequences for which tax law isn&#8217;t relevant.  Whether you are marrying or divorcing, having a baby or buying a home, there are tax considerations that you should know about.  If you are starting a business, depositing the proceeds of a theft in a bank, embezzling or gambling, there are tax considerations that you should know about.  If you are filing a tort action, there are tax ramifications.  If you own property, there are tax consequences.  If you work and earn a salary, there are tax consequences.  If you find a diamond in the street and keep it, there are tax considerations.  If  you get an &#8220;extreme makeover&#8221; home, there are tax consequences.  If your home is rented by tourists in town to see the Master&#8217;s Golf tourney, the tax consequences will vary tremendously if the tenants are there for only 10 days versus if they are there for three weeks, even if you live in the house every other day of the year.  And on and on.</p>
<p>Ted Seto, a tax prof at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles, noted another interesting fact about tax law that relates to this claim.  He notes that many of the important laws in other fields that we tend to think of as just a part of the common law had their origins in&#8211;you guessed it&#8211;tax law.  The following is quoted with his permission:  <a name="more"></a> </p>
<p>
<blockquote>The<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_in_Shelley's_Case"> Rule in Shelley&#8217;s Case </a>was an anti-tax-avoidance rule. So was the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctrine_of_worthier_title">Doctrine of Worthier Title</a>. So was <a href="http://www.britannica.com/facts/5/30781/Quia-Emptores-Statute-of-as-discussed-in-Statutes-of-Westminster-England-1275-1285-1290">quia emptores terrarum</a>, the statute that, by accident, created modern Anglo-American property in the first place. And the <a href="http://www.middle-ages.org.uk/magna-carta.htm">Magna Carta</a>, which created the beginnings of Anglo-American democracy, was a tax cap agreement (sort of like Prop 13). It&#8217;s all tax, all the way down.</p></blockquote>

<p>The ABA Tax Section put together a large working group to write a report on the newly codified economic substance provision&#8211;<a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/files/aba-economic-substance.-comments-on-notice-2010-62.pdf">Download ABA Economic Substance. Comments on Notice 2010-62</a>. </p>
<p>The working group was led by several people, including Michael Desmond, who just happened to be at Treasury during the Bush Administration.  (There are lots of people in private practice now, writing reports on government decisions, who were in government under Bush just a while ago.  Is that a good thing?  I suppose it has its pluses and minuses.  On the plus side, it ensures that there are always those in practice who understand how government works and where important decisions can get hung up or expedited.  ON the minus side, the very decisions that were put in place during a person&#8217;s tenure in government may be susceptible to persuasive lobbying (using that insider perspective) from those who worked on the provision in government and now comment on it on the outside.) </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The practitioner community is generally concerned that the codification of the economic substance doctrine will mean that it will &#8220;chill&#8221; regular business transactions because of the uncertainty regarding its exact application.  So the report asks for clarification&#8211;just what are the transactions that are susceptible to the application of economic substance, what is a substantial purpose, what does it mean to have a potential for profit, how do we know when state tax provisions are related to federal tax provisions, and what, in fact, does &#8220;economic substance doctrine&#8221; mean.</p>
<p>While the desire for absolute clarity is understandable, I am not sure that it is a desire that the Treasury should attempt to satisfy.  One of the benefits of judicial doctrines, compared to very specific statutory anti-abuse provisions, is their flexibility.  Courts, in the context of particular cases, review the circumstances of a transaction and conclude that it lacks economic substance.  The doctrine has developed as part of the federal common law of tax, and it has gone through periods of being particularly useful in curbing super-aggressive tax avoidance shelters.</p>
<p>For people like me who were worried that codification of the doctrine could lead to its demise by narrowing its scope and defining away its power to adapt to unforeseen abusive pattersn (and to create enough uncertainty among tax practitioners to discourage the most aggressive tax return gambits), the ABA&#8217;s demand for &#8220;clarification&#8221; is therefore worrisome.  If we take Congress at its word, it expected the courts to continue applying the doctrine in the circumstances in which they applied the doctrine before codification.  Codification solves the problem of different tests for economic substance applied in different jurisdictions by settling on one test, but it leaves it to the courts&#8217; careful case-by-case analysis to add more meat to the bones of the test.  This is as it should be.</p>
<p>Practitioners would nonetheless like an &#8220;angel&#8221; list of transactions to which the economic substance doctrine can&#8217;t apply.  Treasury has wisely refused, since the power of the doctrine is in looking beyond form to substance and recognizing that abusive transactions (shelters) are highly innovational within the confines of existing statutory provisions.  The creation of an angel list would be an invitation for creative tax genuises to manipulate code sections to create an abusive transaction out of the angel one.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest.  Many practitioners would also like to see the significant test for business purpose narrowed in scope.  Here too I disagree.  it is important for transactions that are honored in their form for tax purposes to have a significant purpose that is germane to the business and not conjured up solely to achieve favorable tax results. </p>
<p>While some guidance would be helpful, Treasury should be careful not to put the pliable economic substance doctrine into a straitjacket that limits its ability to police aggressive transactions.</p>

<p><strong>How Tax Rates Affect Investment and Consumption  &#8211; A Look at the Data</strong><br />Cross posted at the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=301">Presimetrics blog</a> </p>
<p>This post looks at how changes in the top marginal tax rates affect peoples’ decisions on how much to consume and invest.  Ask a libertarian or conservative economist and the answer is obvious – raising tax rates on high income individuals dissuades them from doing productive things – that is to say, it causes them to cut back on working and investing.  In the interest of avoiding strawmen at all costs, many libertarians and conservatives might assume that a hike in the tax rates on such individuals can also cause them to cut back on consumption.  After all, if tax rates are raised high enough, perhaps people won’t have enough left over to consume as much as they otherwise would.  However, the reduction in voluntary activities that take effort (i.e., work, investment) should easily swamp the reduction in consumption, some amount of which is needed for simple survival.  Put another way, as tax rates rise the ratio of investment to consumption should fall.  </p>
<p>That right there is what’s known as a testable implication, and there’s data aplenty for that purpose.  But before we move on to testing this, let me note that the first paragraph actually provides a second, far more familiar testable implication, namely that higher tax rates will generally lead to slower economic growth.  While that particular narrative seems to be widely believed even by non-economists, it certainly isn’t borne out by US data from the last eight decades or so:</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TTyG8ji6arI/AAAAAAAAAgs/KJfOd0aT6wc/s1600/mediangrowth.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TTyG8ji6arI/AAAAAAAAAgs/KJfOd0aT6wc/s400/mediangrowth.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 1</p>
<p>(Figure 1 first appeared in <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=278">this post</a>.)   </p>
<p>The graph shows that, at least until top marginal tax rates get somewhere above 50% (a bit more precision available <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=294">here</a>), increasing those rates does not correlate with slower economic growth, but rather with faster increases in real GDP.  In fact, raising top marginal tax rates <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=253">doesn&#8217;t have many of the effects many people seem to expect</a> (And incidentally, its worth noting that <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=297">state level data </a> also produces <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=105">results the Chicago school and most libertarians don&#8217;t expect</a>.)<br /><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Now, the reason I mention the data’s irresponsible failure to abide by conservative and/or libertarian philosophies when it comes to tax rates and growth is because I think the relationship between tax rates and economic growth can be at least partly explained by the relationship between tax rates and investment.  As I stated <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=261">here</a>, in my opinion, higher tax rates can lead to more investment.  After all, one way a person who owns a business (large or small) can reduce the taxes they pay on profits is to reinvest the profits, which in turn leads to faster economic expansion.  Furthermore, the incentive to avoid taxes and reinvest increases as tax rates increase.  Of course, at some point, tax rates get high enough to encourage individuals to reinvest even though the “benefits” from more reinvestment, at the margin, are negative.  Where that happens, I don’t know, but based on Figure 1, my guess is that it takes a top marginal tax rate above 50%.  </p>
<p>So…  here’s what libertarians and conservatives should expect to see:  as the top marginal tax rises, the ratio of investment to consumption falls.</p>
<p>Here’s what I expect to see:  the relationship between the top marginal tax rate and the ratio of investment to consumption is somewhat curved.  For top marginal tax rates between 0 and some point X (where X > 50%), an increase in the top marginal rate leads to an increase in investment/consumption.  After that, as the top marginal rate rises, we should investment/consumption level off, and for even higher marginal rates, investment/consumption should fall.</p>
<p>So… using top marginal rates from the IRS&#8217; Statistics of Income <a href="http://www.irs.gov/taxstats/article/0,,id=175910,00.html">historical table 23</a>, and national investment and consumption figures from the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis’ National Income and Product Accounts <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=5&#038;ViewSeries=NO&#038;Java=no&#038;Request3Place=N&#038;3Place=N&#038;FromView=YES&#038;Freq=Year&#038;FirstYear=1929&#038;LastYear=2010&#038;3Place=N&#038;Update=Update&#038;JavaB">table 1.1.5</a>, we can construct this little graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TTyG87O6GKI/AAAAAAAAAg0/P-fD752l0Fg/s1600/mediangrowth2.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TTyG87O6GKI/AAAAAAAAAg0/P-fD752l0Fg/s400/mediangrowth2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Figure 2</p>
<p>It’s not a perfect quadratic curve, but it sure looks a lot more like what I had in mind than what any conservative or libertarian would expect.  FYI, the correlation between the top marginal tax rate the ratio of investment to consumption for top marginal tax rates below 50% is 55%.  That is to say, an increase in tax rates increases the ratio of investment to consumption when tax rates are below 50%.  On the other hand, the correlation is a negative 11% when tax rates are above 50%.  That is to say, increasing tax rates when they are above 50% has a (not particularly strong) negative effect on people’s “invest v. consume” decision.  </p>
<p>Put another way – conservatives and libertarians have a very, very flawed theory of the world.  At the very least it does not conform at all with historical US data.  At all.  Which of course has serious consequences; because that theory is somewhat dominant in the political sphere, and has been since the late 60s.  The end result – slower economic growth for all of us since the late 60s.  That has real consequences for real people – 310 million of us.  That should have repercussions for the consciences of economists who peddle this garbage, though apparently it doesn’t.</p>
<p>But that’s for another post.  Today, I want to remain clinical.  So… what does Figure 2 mean, with respect to Figure 1?  It means that, yes, at least until a certain point (somewhere above 50%), raising the top marginal rate both increases the ratio of investment to consumption and the real economic growth rate.  Its not outlandish to assume that increasing investment is one of the factors that can increase real economic growth.  (Worth exploring more in a post sometime in the future.)  Other things matter, of course, but I think investment is up there among factors that matter.</p>
<p>It also means that since we’re keeping tax rates at the level they’ve been for the past decade or so, we shouldn’t expect sustained rapid investment or economic growth any time soon.  Don’t expect the 60s or even the 70s again any time soon – we’re in end of the 80s and 00s level taxation, and over the long haul, we’re in for that sort of growth too.  </p>
<p>A few closing remarks:</p>
<p>1.   1.     This post was partly inspired by an interview I had with <a href="http://www.electricpolitics.com/faq.html">George Kenney of Electric Politics</a>.  It was a really useful and interesting conversation for me, in part because he pressed me a bit past my comfort level.  I understand he’ll have that interview up in a few weeks.</p>
<p>2.   2.     I’ve noticed that a number of the graphs I’ve been putting up are not so much quadratic as a bit bimodal.  I have been thinking about that for the past few days, and I think that will be my next post on this “kimel curve” approach to world I’ve been following lately.  </p>
<p>3.   3.     Please, please, please, please, if you object to something in this post and are planning to bring up Romer and Romer, read <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/01/further-critique-of-romer-and-romer.html">this</a> first to save me from being embarrassed on your behalf.</p>
<p>4.   4.    As always, my spreadsheets are available to anyone who wants them.  </p>
<p>5.   5.    Between the time I finished my spreadsheet and the time I wrote this post, I read this blurb from <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2011/01/the-great-stagnation-excerpt.html">Tyler Cowen&#8217;s next book</a>.  It might be uncharitable of me, but my first thought was to wonder about the odds a libertarian professor would add two and two together, and whether he could remain libertarian if he inadvertently did.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC96XnP3o4I/AAAAAAAABOs/9Dj35HmcKqQ/s1600/Clipboard01-cbo.bmp"><br /></a>CoRev  asks if anyone wants to discuss the justifications of the beneficiaries of the different parties policies.  So I though this gives me an opportunity to present some recently published<br />CBO data  on income and tax that could give people something to tie the discussion to.</p>
<p>Republican policy has been to favor the more affluent in our society and justifies it with the claim that increasing the wealth and/or income of the &#8220;investor class&#8221; will make everyone better off &#8212; a rising tide lifts all boats.  If this worked I would strongly support such policies.</p>
<p>But look at what this data shows has happened between 1979 and 2007.  This is a good set of dates for comparisons because it is essentially a peak to peak comparison from just prior to the 1980-1982 double recession and the current recession.  Moreover, it is an era dominated by the Republican policy of tax cutting and the investment boom of the 1990.</p>
<p>First, as everyone knows this has been an era of a great surge of income inequality driven both by natural economic forces &#8212; the winner take all economy &#8212;  and tax policy.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC93YRYaZmI/AAAAAAAABN8/my6qS56aZHY/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC93YRYaZmI/AAAAAAAABN8/my6qS56aZHY/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>The net product of this 30 year era was a shift of about ten percentage points of the economic pie from the bottom four quintiles to the top quintile.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC93oXmmIDI/AAAAAAAABOE/BYY7qqLu0SI/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC93oXmmIDI/AAAAAAAABOE/BYY7qqLu0SI/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />This shift in the share of income share by the top quintile has also generated a significant<br />increase in the share of taxes paid by the top quintile.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC94M1IAyyI/AAAAAAAABOU/y0M8zTLl_KM/s1600/Clipboard03.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC94M1IAyyI/AAAAAAAABOU/y0M8zTLl_KM/s320/Clipboard03.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />But the shift in the distribution of the tax burden is due entirely to the growth in income<br />rather than a shift in tax policy as the average effective tax rate paid by each quintile has fallen. Actually, on a proportional basis the lowest quintile had the largest drop in its tax burden.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC94cs3hBzI/AAAAAAAABOc/6YjPhyeFkVw/s1600/Clipboard04.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC94cs3hBzI/AAAAAAAABOc/6YjPhyeFkVw/s320/Clipboard04.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The federal tax burden is quite progressive as the last chart shows.  But in general state and local taxes such as sales taxes and property taxes are much more regressive, so the total tax burden is much less progressive than this chart implies.</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC96XnP3o4I/AAAAAAAABOs/9Dj35HmcKqQ/s1600/Clipboard01-cbo.bmp"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TC96XnP3o4I/AAAAAAAABOs/9Dj35HmcKqQ/s320/Clipboard01-cbo.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>If this shift in income to the top quintile had generated the increase in savings and investment and generated widely shared prosperity it would be a good thing, and the<br />greater income inequality would be a fair trade-off for greater growth.</p>
<p>But the actual results since the early 1980s has been a significant slowing of economic growth  and a drop in private savings&#8211; just the opposite of what republicans and economic theory says would happen.  Rather the results has been that since the early 1980s the US has increasingly lived beyond it means and ran up a major foreign debt to finance this consumption binge.  The two major drives behind this shift in the US has been the Reagan and Bush tax cuts.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll take on CoRev and argue that the reason I oppose Republican policies is that they have been a complete and utter failure to deliver the results they promise.  They have just ran up a massive foreign debt to finance our living beyond our means and now blame Obama because he has failed to reverse the adverse impact of the failed republican policies.</p>
<p>Supporting the republican &#8220;starve the beast&#8221; strategy reminds me of the comment I use to make back in the early 1970s that if Arthur Burns &#8212; the Fed Chairman &#8212; was a friend of business, business did not need any enemies.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>

                                <p><strong>by Mike Kimel</strong><br />Cross-posted on the <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=86">Presimetrics blog</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes and Private Sector Investment &#8211; Evidence from the Real World</strong><br />Last week I had a post (which appeared both  <a href="http://www.presimetrics.com/blog/?p=60">here</a> and at <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/06/presidents-tax-burden-and-corruption.html">Angry Bear</a>).  The post included the following graph:</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TClSjqd2UvI/AAAAAAAAATA/nfeWYX1Yadw/s1600/mkimel1.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TClSjqd2UvI/AAAAAAAAATA/nfeWYX1Yadw/s320/mkimel1.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 1</p>
<p>The graph looks at every eight year period since 1929 (the first year for which National Accounts data is available from the Bureau of Economic Analysis) that can be thought of as a complete “administration.” It notes that there is a very strong negative correlation between the tax burden in the first two years of an administration and the economic growth that follows in the remaining six years of the administration.  In plain English – the more the tax burden was reduced during the first two years of an administration, the slower the economic growth in the following six years.  Conversely, the more the tax burden was raised during the first two years of each administration, the faster economic growth was during the following six years.</p>
<p>At this point I note… this is not my opinion, it is what the data shows.  And there is no cherry picking – I went back as far as there was data and included every eight year stretch for which a single President occupied the Oval Office or in which a VP took over from a President in the middle of a term.  And these real world results contradict just about everything that standard economic theory (Classical, Austrian, you name it) tells you.  </p>
<p>So I tried providing an explanation:  <br /><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Michael Kanell and I advanced several theories in <ital>Presimetrics</ital> but the one I think makes the most sense is that changes in the tax burden are a sign of the degree to which an administration enforces laws and regulations.</p></blockquote>
<p>The logic is simple – (1) collectively, Americans cheat on their taxes and (2) whether the tax burden, the percentage of GDP that the government collects in taxes, rises or falls seems to have nothing whatsoever to do with whether marginal income tax rates rise or fall.  Thus, one way for tax burdens to go up is increased enforcement, and one way for tax burdens to fall is decreased enforcement.  </p>
<p>Now, to me that’s self-evident.  But I’m starting to realize not everyone sees it this way, so let’s run a simple test.   If a regime tolerates corruption or encourages companies to game the system rather than to be productive, we should expect growth in the private sector to be minimal at best.  All else being equal, we should expect faster growth in the private sector the less rot there is in the system.  I assume this is not remotely controversial.  And it implies that if tax collections are indeed an indicator of an administration’s intolerance for shenanigans, then growing tax burdens should be followed by rapidly increasing private sector activity and falling tax burdens should be followed by relatively slow growth in private sector activity.  </p>
<p>Crazy, right?  Lower taxes leading to less private sector activity!  Insanity!  It defies economic theory.  And common sense.  But how does it fit with what happened in the real world?  Extremely well, actually.  </p>
<p>The graph below shows the change in the tax burden in the first two years of each 8 year administration on the horizontal axis, and the annualized  change in real private investment per capita in the remaining six years along the vertical axis.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TClTFan1ApI/AAAAAAAAATI/axWPmyY1GCs/s1600/mkimel2.bmp"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_8UVGnCIfOVk/TClTFan1ApI/AAAAAAAAATI/axWPmyY1GCs/s320/mkimel2.bmp" border="0" alt=""></a>Figure 2.</p>
<p>Notice…  administrations that cut the tax burden early saw mediocre increases in private investment later.  On the other hand, administrations that started out by increasing the tax burden enjoyed big increases in private investment in the remainder of their term.  This is yet another instance where real world results contradict just about everything that standard economic theory teaches, particularly the Chicago School, Austrian, and Libertarian variety.  And sadly, that theory has so permeated our collective thought processes that it has come to be referred to as “common sense.”   Just as it was common sense at one point that the earth was flat, and the center of the universe.  </p>
<p>It’s worth pointing out, by the way, that the relationship between the tax burden and real private consumption is similar; administrations that raised the tax burden saw greater increases in real private consumption per capita than administrations that reduced the tax burden.  The relationship, albeit a strong one, is slightly weaker than the relationship between tax burdens and investment.  By contrast, the relationship between changes in the tax burden in years 1 and 2 and changes in real Federal Government spending per capita are much, much weaker.</p>
<p>So let me revisit once more the explanation that Michael Kanell and I put forward in <ital>Presimetrics</ital> and which is consistent with the data presented in both graphs above.  Administrations that cut the tax burden tended to do so mostly by reducing enforcement of tax laws and regulations.  But people who don’t believe in enforcing tax laws are also not particularly fond of most other forms of rules and regulations, preferring a laissez faire “pro-business” government in all walks of life.  Sure, there may well be many private sector winners when the government allows a free-for-all.  However, as the costs of exploiting loopholes, breaking laws and creating externalities falls relative to the costs of doing productive things, fewer truly useful productive activities take place, and that kills growth.  </p>
<p>If you have a better explanation, let me know. </p>

<p>Data sources and comments.</p>
<p>The definition of the tax burden used in this post is Federal government current receipts from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=87&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010"> line 1 of NIPA Table 3.2</a>divided by GDP from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=5&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">NIPA Table 1.1.5, line 1</a>.  Real economic growth was measured as the change in real GDP per capita, which was obtained from <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=264&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">NIPA Table 7.1, line 10</a>.  Population came from the last row in the same table.</p>
<p>Real private investment came from  <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=6&#038;Freq=Qtr&#038;FirstYear=2008&#038;LastYear=2010">line 7 of NIPA Table 1.1.6</a>.</p>
<p>As always, the change in any series over the length of an administration is measured from the year before the administration took office (the “baseline” from which it starts) to its last year in office.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>I intend to look at the relationships described in this post in a bit more detail going forward.  However, expect the next post to cover another issue which seems to come up a lot – whether the results I’ve been posting are statistically valid or not. </p>
<p>Note also&#8230; if it’s not obvious, this post deals with the tax burden, the share of GDP going to the Federal government, and not marginal tax rates.  Please do not insist on commenting on a topic unrelated to this post.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>told Paul Krugman so</p>
<p>About 21 months ago Paul Krugman had <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/baselines-shmaselines/">a question</a></p>
<blockquote><p>lower and middle-income Americans would be substantially better off under the Obama plan. But where is the money for health care reform?</p></blockquote>
<p>I <a href="http://rjwaldmann.blogspot.com/2008/06/fica-is-full-text-of-comment-i-posted.html">proposed an answer</a></p>
<blockquote><p>there are two puzzles in Obama&#8217;s proposals<br />1) How does he plan to pay for both health care reform and his middle class tax cut ?<br />2) Why is he raising the social security tax even though it is probably not needed to pay old age and disability pensions ?</p>
<p>I think the two questions answer each other. I think that Obama is planning to pay for health care reform with the donut FICA increase (taxing individual labor income over $250,000).</p></blockquote>
<p>Now we know. Yes most of the money for health care reform came from planning to have the CMS squeeze hospitals and nursing homes, then much from eliminating the Medicare advantage boondoggle (not eliminating the program just paying private insurance companies the same per policy holder as the CMS spends), then from the tax on expensive health plans.</p>
<p>However, when cutting that unpopular tax, expanding subsidies, making the special deal for Nebraska universal and making the special deal for collectively bargained health insurance benefits universal, Obama was short a few hundred billion. So in the Obama compromise proposal (the first proposal from the Obama administration) the donut tax returned.</p>
<p>
<blockquote><a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/03/worth-reading-2-what-is-and-isnt-in-the-health-care-bill-march-30-2010.html">The bill imposes new taxes on wealthier people. Individuals making more than $200,000, and families making more than $250,000, will have to give up more of their paycheck to the Hospital Insurance payroll tax. Instead of paying 1.45 percent like most workers, they’ll pay 2.35 percent. And a new 3.8 percent tax will be added to income from interest, dividends, annuities, royalties, and rents</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>OK so it&#8217;s described as an increase in the Medicare plan A tax not the social security old age and disability pension tax. It starts at income of 200,000 or family income of 250,000. It applies to capital income too. The rate is lower than I guessed way back then (I just assumed it was 6.25%). Still I now type &#8220;I told you so.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was always there in his mind in case it was needed.</p>

<p>As some of you may know, I am one of the many people who eat a vegetarian diet. I don&#8217;t eat cows, pigs, fish, whales, sharks, chicken, turkey, sheep, wild game, tame game&#8230; As I sometimes say when people ask me about my diet, I eat everything you eat, except for a very short list of items&#8211;the critters that can move themselves from one place to another (or move their appendages) under their own propulsion.</p>
<p>(Note that we often have two words for animals that we eat&#8211;their live-form word &#8211;e.g., cow, sheep, pig&#8211; and their edible-corpse form word &#8211;e.g., beef, mutton, pork. That evolved when we borrowed the Romance language word for what we ate but kept the Germanic language word for the animals.)</p>
<p>It started when I was a child&#8211;I was one of those who would cut the meat into tiny pieces and then spread it all over my plate so it looked like I&#8217;d eaten it. The idea of eating a cow, with those beautiful liquid brown eyes, was repulsive. (My father came from a family with thirteen kids in the hills of Tennessee, so I&#8217;d seen cows up close.) I even took a whole piece of veal once and hid it behind the dining room cabinet (taking it out to the wastebasket after it dried)! I refused to eat the squirrel and venison that my dad brought home from hunting trips (mostly, if not always, somebody else&#8217;s kill). I even refused to let my cocker spaniel share in that dead stock.</p>
<p>But now that I&#8217;m an adult, why do I maintain that diet? I get asked that a lot.</p>
<p>Funny, nobody says (with shocked exression)&#8211;&#8220;Gee, you eat meat? Why would anyone ever want to eat a toxins-laden dead corpse of an animal that lived a horrendous life and suffered an agonizing death? &#8221; But they do often ask&#8211;usually treating it as a good-natured tease about a wacky alternative diet&#8211;why I&#8217;d want to avoid eating corpses.</p>
<p>James McWilliams got me thinking about this again this morning, when I read his &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/15/AR2009111502210.html?wpisrc=newsletter">Bellying up to environmentalism</a>&#8221; in the Washington Post for Nov. 16, 2009, where he noted that we should be asking questions in the reverse, that make meateaters feel uncomfortable at defending their own meateating. After all, there&#8217;s really no good reason for eating meat other than that someone is so addicted to its taste that he or she can&#8217;t exert the willpower to do without it.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The whys for not eating meat, on the other hand, are legion. Let me just list a few here, from the mundane to the truly significant:</p>
<p>1. cooking is easier&#8211;throw veggies in a pot and steam them; throw veggies in a pot and make soup, throw veggies in a fry pan and fry them, throw beggies in a pot and bake them; and variants thereon</p>
<p>2. clean-up is a lot easier&#8211;none of that icky clinging greasy layer of animal fat on every pan</p>
<p>3. refrigerated leftover use is easier&#8211;throw the leftovers in a pot and steam them (etc. from one above) and there&#8217;s none of that congealed lard on top of the leftovers in the fridge</p>
<p>4. rotten vegetables in the fridge are less disgusting than rotten corpses in the fridge</p>
<p>5. a decent diet is generally considerably cheaper</p>
<p>6. the more people who adopt a vegetarian diet, the more people who are currently going hungry could be fed
<ul>
<li>one of the many articles I&#8217;ve read said something that stuck with me (sorry, don&#8217;t have the cite)&#8211;that it takes the same resources to feed one meat-eater that it takes to feed about 80 vegetarians. </li>
<li>That&#8217;s because of the huge waste as you use up primary foodstuffs to feed the animals that will be slaughtered, then use up primary energy stuffs to slaughter, process, ship and deliver the meat to the meat eater, compared to even transported vegetables (localvore, with vegetables, is even more saving of resources)</li>
</ul>
<p>7. without meat-eating, there are no feedlots where animals literally eat and sleep out the remainder of their short lives in their own shit</p>
<p>8. you can have a small flock of hens who live out their natural lives with nice living conditions (indoor/outdoor) </p>
<ul>
<li>disclosure: I had one hen who lived to be 22; she was still laying eggs up until the week or so before her death from natural causes</li>
</ul>
<p>9. Hens lay bigger and bigger eggs each year that they live past the first year w(hen most are slaughtered) and they still lay fairly regularly</p>
<ul>
<li>disclosure: 6 eggs every 7 days was typical in my experience</li>
</ul>
<p>10. Even hens have personalities</p>
<ul>
<li>disclosure: when I lived in upstate New York, I had one named Gumption who loved to fly up to the top of a two-story house and survey her domain, and another named &#8220;kiss me&#8221; who would follow me around all day like a pet dog</li>
</ul>
<p>11. Animals that we eat are as smart as&#8211;or smarter than&#8211;animals that we keep for pets (pigs compared to dogs, for example)</p>
<p>12. Animals care for their young and suffer when their young are taken from them (think dairy cattle and the young that are bred so that the mothers will give milk)</p>
<p>13. Some eating of animals is even more obnoxious than the norm (think &#8220;veal calves&#8221; that are taken and put in tiny sheds to they can fatten without any musculature development or &#8220;foie gras&#8221; where geese are fattened by having food stuffed down their throats with a tube)</p>
<p>14. Life is precious: there is no reason to sacrifice animal lives to lead a decent human life, so why do it?</p>
<p>15. Agribusiness&#8211;the main way that animals are raised and sold for meat&#8211;is an environmental nightmare</p>
<ul>
<li>use of fertilizers to grow the grain that is fed to the cattle that are fed to the humans results in polluted land, water and air and uses up petroleum and other resources</li>
<li>consolidation results in long transportation (inhumane to animals; wasteful of oil and gas resources)</li>
<li>the subsidies (including some tax expenditures) for agriculture have gotten out of control&#8211;costly, misdirected, ill-conceived, and essentially now a form of corporate welfare for huge agribusiness enterprises</li>
</ul>
<p>16. A meatless diet is healthier for humans than a meat-based diet, so we could cut health-care costs by simply cutting out meat</p>
<p>17. The process of butchering animals is a cruel leftover from the dark ages&#8211;people who work in slaughterhouses are inured to suffering, and that may well spill over into their &#8220;normal&#8221; lives outside work</p>
<p>18. The process of butchering animals is itself a source of harm&#8211;</p>
<ul>
<li>sick animals are slaughtered, making it possible that eaters of that dead flesh will be sickened as well (mad cow disease);</li>
<li>animals are slaughtered in the midst of their own excrement, and some of that excrement gets into the food chain (making people sick as well);</li>
<li>the leftovers from the animal slaughter have to be gotten rid of somehow, leading to even more water, land and air pollution</li>
<li>workers are exposed to awful conditions&#8211;not just the process of mercilessly killing animals day in and day out, but also the risk of infection and injury on the line</li>
</ul>
<p>19. The use of antibiotics in animal feed (given to healthy and unhealthy animals alike) ensures that resistant strains will develop even more rapidly, while leaving excess antibiotics not absorbed by the animals to pass out in their urine and excrement and into the land and water to act as toxins to others (including fish and birds and humans) leading to additional environmental nightmares&#8230;</p>
<p>20. Agribusiness pig farms and cattle feedlots are a blight on any humans within their vicinity (as well as a disaster for the natural world, noted above under environmental problems) from the stench of the manure (that can pollute the countryside for miles around) to the ugliness of the barren, treeless manure-laden fields.</p>
<p>So what to do? Maybe we should enact an excise tax on all meat products, like a&#8221;sin&#8221; tax for sodas and sweets and cigarettes. Comments, anyone?</p>
<p>PS Arthur C. Clarke has a great sci fi short story, taking place some time in the future, when a more advanced civilization than ours is aghast at the purported discovery that their ancestors used to&#8211;cover the young ones&#8217; ears&#8211;eat dead corpses of animals&#8230;..Clarke&#8217;s ideas were way ahead of his time in lots of ways.</p>

<p><a target="_blank" href="http://blog.american.com/?p=3990">Andrew Biggs</a> wrote  that current Medicare recipients have not paid enough for the benefits they will recieve.  He states that &#8220;since this is zero sum, it means that future taxpayers will get less than they pay for.&#8221;  Here is an excerpt of what he said, followed by my comments.</p>
<p>Biggs said:</p>
<blockquote><p>unlike Social Security benefits, which increase only to keep up with inflation, Medicare benefits grow in real terms. The Medicare Trustees project    that health costs will grow around 1 percentage point faster than the growth of per capita GDP, which in turn they project will grow around 1.3 percent faster than inflation over the next 15 years. So I assume that real Medicare benefits will increase by 2.3 percent each year.<br />&#8230;<br />to make taxes and benefits comparable, I convert each to present value terms, assuming a real interest rate of 3 percent. This means that taxes paid in the past have 3 percent interest added each year, to account for the fact that these taxes could otherwise have been invested. Likewise, future benefits have 3 percent annual interest deducted, to account for the fact that retirees must wait to receive them.<br />&#8230;<br />So what do we get? This typical person paid around $64,971 in Medicare payroll taxes over his lifetime. Likewise, after netting out Medicare premiums, he’ll receive around $173,886 in lifetime Medicare benefits. The net? He can expect to receive around $108,915 more in benefits than he paid in taxes over his lifetime.<br />&#8230;<br />Alternately, let’s put this in terms of return on investment: the typical worker’s Medicare taxes produce an annual compound return of around 6.25 percent above inflation. This is comparable to the return on stocks, without any of the risk. A low-income worker with earnings at half the average wage would receive an 8.45 percent return on his Medicare taxes, while even a high earner at twice the average wage would receive a 4 percent real return—again, without any market=2 0risk.<br />&#8230;<br />While we can quibble about some of the assumptions and calculations, the scale of Medicare transfers to current beneficiaries is undeniably huge. And since Medicare’s pay-as-you-go financing is zero sum, these transfers, like similar overpayments to early participants in Social Security, will result in future Medicare beneficiaries receiving far less in benefits than they will pay in taxes.</p></blockquote>
<p>My objections are below the fold.</p>
<p>My objections to Biggs&#8217; main argument are first that &#8220;present value&#8221; is not a useful way to evaluate programs like Medicare and Social Security, which are insurance programs.  As such they would need to be compared to otherwise similar insurance programs, not to imaginary &#8220;investments&#8221; with different risks.</p>
<p>Moreover, I question the logic of claiming that Medicare is &#8220;zero sum.&#8221;  It seems to me that for this to be true there would have to be an endpoint at which all the taxes that are ever going to be collected, and all payments that are ever going to be made, have been. </p>
<p>It is easier for me to imagine that while the costs of medical care for each generation might increase so that under pay as you go each &#8220;paying&#8221; generation pays more than the last, and each &#8220;receiving&#8221; generation gets &#8220;more than it paid for,&#8221;  this &#8220;profit&#8221; will continue for each generation in its turn as each subsequent generation lives longer than the last with the  benefit of increasingly expensive medical care.  It seems likely to me that this approaches a limit, and entirely possible that each generation does a little bit &#8220;less better&#8221; than the last, but that hardly seems a reason to abandon a program that provides badly needed insurance for each generation in turn.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generational equity&#8221; is a delusion.  Each generation will face different problems like war, depression, inflation, the draft, better or worse weather, compared to which a small difference in the &#8220;return on investment&#8221; is not worth worrying about&#8230; especially an entirely imaginary, projected, difference based on an entirely arbitrary &#8220;present value&#8221; discount rate. and a complete misunderstanding of the difference between insurance and investment.</p>
<p>Medical care, like retirement costs, are consumed on a &#8220;daily bread&#8221; basis.  Unless you can show that you have a better way to pay for it, with adequate guarantees, talking about it in &#8220;present value&#8221; terms is false precision and solving the wrong problem.  This doesn&#8217;t mean that we ought to ignore projections of higher future costs, but it does mean we don&#8217;t need to cut off our own heads to avoid the future high cost of living.<br />_________________________<br />by reader coberly</p>

<p>Steve Benen made <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_04/017795.php">a graph </a>out of a table from <a href="http://www.forbes.com/2009/04/16/tax-tea-party-opinions-columnists-protest.html">a column by Bruce Bartlett</a>.  Bruce Bartlett is an interesting figure &#8212; a heterodox conservative who praises Reagan and criticizes Bush Jr.  The figure sure fits Bartlett&#8217;s line.  It shows the effective tax rate on families with median income.  Sad to say, Steve Benen&#8217;s web page is a *.mht ??? and <s>I don&#8217;t know how to steal the figure</s> [see UPDATE below] so just <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_04/017795.php">click</a>.<br />
<blockquote>Bartlett identified the &#8220;effective federal income tax rate &#8212; taxes paid as a share of income &#8212; for a family with the median income. The median is the exact middle of the income distribution &#8212; half of families are above and half are below. It&#8217;s as close as we can get, statistically, to the typical American family.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>[<strong>UPDATE</strong>: I do know how to steal graphics, but you should read <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_04/017795.php">the Benen piece</a> as well. Graphic above by Steve Benen, from data presented by Bruce Bartlett. -klh]</p>
<p>It shows an increase up until the election of saint Ronnie, then a decrease, a sharp decrease in 1986, more decline when the GOP took control of Congress, a down tick when Bush was elected and Bartlett still supported him, then a gradual increase as Bartlett became a critic.</p>
<p>Oh how convenient.  I describe how he is cheating after the jump.</p>
<p>As anyone who has ever filled out a 1040EZ must know, this is nonsense.  Effective tax rates do not depend only on income.  The table would be meaningful if Bartlett had calculated the average effective tax rate of families with the median income, but that&#8217;s not what he said.  I suspect that he used a &#8220;tax family&#8221; with median income and characteristics such that the graph looked the way he wanted.</p>
<p>Of course, Bartlett is talking about the income tax only.  The increase in FICA under Reagan doesn&#8217;t appear.  That is par for the course for a Republican.  </p>
<p>Less importantly for the median family, he doesn&#8217;t consider the capital gains tax.  However, the average family with median income pays positive capital gains tax (the average of a non negative variable must be positive).  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that Bartlett&#8217;s &#8220;median family&#8221; has 2 earners and 2 children.  I see a big drop when the marriage penalty was reduced.</p>
<p>The average family with median income has less than 2 earners and less than 2 children.  The family which pays the median effective tax rate &#8230; I have no idea.</p>
<p>I will now check my guess (starting 5:59 EDT) by clicking <a target="blank" href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/Content/PDF/family_inc_rates_hist.pdf">a link</a>.</p>
<p>6:00 AM EDT. Yep he lied.  The table which appears when I click his link is Entitled &#8220;Average and Marginal Income Tax Rates for Four Person Families &#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>That is not &#8220;as close as we can get statistically to the typical family.&#8221;<br /><a href="ho1wihij:www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1129.pdf+number+of+families+in+USA&#038;cd=2&#038;hl=en&#038;ct=clnk&#038;gl=it&#038;lr=lang_en">The Bureau of the Census projected in 1996 that that in 2005 the average number of persons per family would be 3.09</a> which is rather less than 4.</p>
<p>It does seem that I was wrong about the number of earners.  They assume one earner not two.  Median income is for four person families.</p>
<p>Now part of what is going on here is that the &#8220;Tax Policy Center&#8221; is trying to make Reagan look good.  However, that isn&#8217;t all that&#8217;s going on.  They care about what they consider to be normal families.  Single adults without children and single mothers with children don&#8217;t count.  Women are assumed to be housewives.  The only people that matter are those in families which consist of one working dad, mom and two children.  For families with median income single mothers with three children slip into the sampel (lucky duckies).  For half median income they don&#8217;t as it is assumed that there are 2 children in the family for the purposes of the EITC.</p>
<p>I think their prejudices about what is normal is even stronger than their Hackitude as Bush Jr would look better if one considered the marriage penalty. </p>
