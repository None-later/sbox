<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/somebody-in-government-finally-asks-a-taxing-question-about-the-next-war/2012/06/20/gJQA7HeLrV_story.html">The Washington Post</a> quotes Senator Leahy:</p>
<blockquote><p>At last, after 11 years of the United States at war, a few minutes of public discussion of a tax to pay for the fighting. But that would be for the next war.</p>
<blockquote><p>“What would be the impact of going to war again without committing to pay for that war with up-front taxes, something we did not do in either Iraq or Afghanistan, for the first time in the history of the country?” Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) asked Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta at a Senate Defense Appropriation subcommittee hearing on June 13.</p>
<p>That’s a question that should be asked before any president sends U.S. forces into a fight overseas or members of Congress propose legislation that authorizes some sort of military action abroad.</p>
<p>“We basically ran that war [Iraq] on a credit card,” Leahy told Panetta, who was there to discus the fiscal 2013 Defense Appropriations bill. “Now we find people who are calling for more military action in other parts of the world; at the same time, they do not want to consider any way of paying for it.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Wealthy Non-Taxpayers &#8212; From 60 to Thousands in 30 Years</p>
<p>Bruce Bartlett provides the numbers, but it&#8217;s so much easier to see in a chart.</p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WyShLkF8Ta4/T9CKO32awpI/AAAAAAAAA3k/gs5NFvPS6Fo/s1600/wealthy+non-taxpayers+1977-2009.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="181" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WyShLkF8Ta4/T9CKO32awpI/AAAAAAAAA3k/gs5NFvPS6Fo/s320/wealthy+non-taxpayers+1977-2009.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
<p>Wealthy Non-Taxpayers 1977 to 2009, showing incomes over $200,000 per year.  Blue is percentage of total households over $200,000 paying no taxes, purple is numbers of high-income households paying no taxes. Numbers from chart here: <a href="http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/rich-nontaxpayers/">http://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/06/05/rich-nontaxpayers/</a>, drawn    <br />from IRS data.</p>
<p>On this chart, the percentage appears relatively stable with a low of 0.066 to a high of 0.529 (66 per 100,000 to 529 per 100,000) but actually that’s an eightfold increase, mostly accruing after 2004.<br />The numbers of households, however, leap like a gazelle after 2004, reaching a high of 22,000 high income households paying no taxes, from a low of only 60 in 1977.</p>

<p><strong>Summers says taxes must increase</strong><br />  <br />For once, I find myself agreeing with Larry Summers. At a conference in Washington sponsored by the Brookings Institute, he emphasized that tax cuts and spending cuts cannot appropriately resolve the US budgetary issues. <br />
<blockquote>“It is a near certainty that we are going to need a significant increase in revenues, and it seems to me that any discussion of tax policy needs to start there,” <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-05-03/rubin-says-tax-overhaul-presents-difficult-substance-politics.html">Summers Says U.S. Tax Overhaul Should Raise More Money</a>, Bloomberg.com (May 3, 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p>Without additional taxes, &#8220;close to inconceivable&#8221; cuts to earned benefits programs like Medicare and Social Security would be required, he noted. Id.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that people start talking some sense about taxes since they are the lifeblood of a democracy and the primary way that a government can act to limit the concentration of wealth in the hands of the few that diminishes democracy by promoting oligarchy. </p>
<p>I suspect most of the insiders in the Republican Party know this and know that if common sense reigns, taxes will be raised on the upper crust and raised somewhat on most of the middle class, in order to ensure that the US can deal with its crumbling infrastructure, support its citizens, not just the wealthy ones, in developing their human capital, and provide a decent and sustainable standard of living for most of our people. That is why the Republican Party is engaged these days in brinksmanship legislative (and judicial) action. As the extreme right has gained representation through strong turnout of the more ideological base, </p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Republican congressmen and women have played a one-note tune, using the filibuster in the Senate to stymie majority rule and repeatedly relying on counterfactual assumptions about the economy and meaningless soundbite promotions&#8211;such as the idea that tax cuts result in greater revenues (not so) or the notion that Social Security is bankrupt (not so) or the idea that lower income Americans should pay more in taxes rather than increasing the taxes paid by the extraordinarily wealthy upper-crust that has seen its taxes lowered during the three-plus decades of reaganomics&#8211;to convince Americans that a return to the laissez-faire, corporate titan economy that reigned at the turn of the nineteenth century would lead to prosperity. </p>
<p>One of the major problems facing this country today, and its economy, is the huge gap between the income of a few ultra rich and the rest of us, and the near-poverty level of income for many Americans. Countries with such inequalities generally have poor quality of life indicators on a lot of fronts, and the US is no exception. Teenage birth rates, illiteracy, health care, low-birth weight babies, unemployment&#8211;a litany of societal ills accompanies high inequality within a society, and the US suffers from almost all of them.</p>
<p>Why then is it that our policymakers do not recognize the central role of the tax system in either fostering inequality&#8211;as it has been for thirty years under reaganomics, as we reduced the role of the estate tax, provided an extraordinarily preferential rate for capital gains (the type of income mostly enjoyed by the very wealthy), and otherwise provided deductions and preferences that had the effect of redistributing upwards from the vast middle to the few at the top. Yet right wing economists like Martin Feldstein refuse to recognize the devastating impact of huge inequality on the economy.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Our problem in the income distribution area is poverty, and you should be concerned about combating poverty, not inequality.” Id (quoting Martin Feldstein).</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps Feldstein has bought the Kool-Aid of the American myth, that we are a society with great mobility, no class structure, where everyone can &#8220;rise by his own bootstraps&#8221; and become a millionaire. That mobile and classless society may have almost existed in the golden years after World War II, when veterans came back, went to college on the GI Bill, and raised families in small towns across the US that were dominated by locally owned stores and regional food supplies. But the US society has lost a considerable amount of that mobility. Yes, there are some at the bottom who win the lottery (literally or figuratively) and move up, and there are some at the top who don&#8217;t stay at the top. But generally in this country, the father&#8217;s wealth determines the wealth of the son, who inherits it at no tax cost and generally increases it because that wealth is mostly represented by capital assets whose income is preferentially taxed at very low rates.</p>
<p>Ultimately, this nation would be best served by merely allowing the ill-considered Bush tax cuts to expire as they are slated to do under current law. Then hopefully a more reflective group of legislators can get together and discuss how best to modify our tax system to deal with the issues that face us in this century&#8211;global companies that move their intellectual property offshore in order to avoid taxes and who no longer have any sense of loyalty to country; too big to fail institutions in banking, insurance, and global multinational corporations; and excessive subsidies for companies that are making billions in profits and paying almost no taxes, such as the oil and gas industry, the agribusiness industry, and multinationals like GE. </p>
<p>I think a big part of the answer requires rethinking in a direction quite different from the one that the right is pushing: to considerably narrow the tax-free provisions for mergers, acquisitions and spin-offs; to modify the transfer pricing formula to reject treatment of intellectual property developed in this country as &#8220;sold&#8221; to a controlled subsidiary; to recognize the need to protect domestic industry from globalization that leaves us too dependent on imports; and to re-invigorate anti-trust and consumer protection laws so that industries can no longer sell products and leave customers without recourse to information or repair because of unintelligible call services in the Philippines and &#8220;company policies&#8221; that refuse to reimburse a customer for damage done to a printer by a cartridge sold by the printer manufacturer.</p>

<p>Taxes and Economic Growth:  Real World &#038; Simulations</p>
<p>   Over the past few years, I&#8217;ve posted many times on an unpleasant reality:  despite the fact that so many people believe otherwise, in general, lower taxes do not result in faster economic growth.   It is really too bad, because we could all be better off if only lower tax rates led to faster economic growth.  However, the association between slower econoimc growth and lower tax rates is something we can see in data from the US, whether we use national level data, state and local data, or anything in between.     </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a post I wrote not that long ago noting that when top marginal tax rates are below about 65% or so, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/laffer-curve-and-kimel-curve.html">cutting taxes is associated with slower economic growth and raising taxes is associated with faster economic growth</a>.  Here&#8217;s something <a href="http://www.voxeu.org/index.php?q=node/7402">a bit more academic showing the same thing</a>.    </p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve noted before, there&#8217;s a logical reason why lowering top marginal rates slows economic growth (except when top marginal rates are very high), and it should be obvious to anyone who has ever run a business:  the easiest way to avoid, or at least postpone paying taxes for is not to show taxable income.  If your business looks like it will show a profit, reinvest the revenues, pushing up costs and voila, you don&#8217;t have any profits for the IRS to tax.  But, by doing so, you are also strengthening the company, which means setting the stage for faster growth in later years.  And you&#8217;re more likely to follow this strategy, rather than consume your profits, the higher the tax rate.   <br /><a name="more"></a>Notice that this little story depends entirely on the self-interest of people in the economy.  Money collected in taxes could be put in a big hole and burned, and the story would still work.  (Of course, the story works better if whatever is collected in taxes is actually used productively, but that isn&#8217;t a requirement.)</p>
<p>The response I&#8217;ve gotten via e-mail and commentary comes overwhelmingly in two flavors: a.  You lie about the data and you don&#8217;t understand how people react to changes in tax rates. b.  That may be what the data shows, but it can&#8217;t possibly work in theory so it must be wrong.   </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help the group folks in group a &#8211; I&#8217;ve offered up my spreadsheets, and frankly, anyone should be able to replicate it &#8211; this stuff ain&#8217;t rocket science.  But this post is for the folks in the second group.</p>
<p>For grins and giggles, yesterday I made a simple little simulation tool in Excel which is intended to look at the behavior of a very wealthy person reacting to changes in tax rates.  In any given period, the person consumes some percentage of the wealth they happen to have.  The remainder, the savings, are allowed to grow.   Individuals get a benefit from both consumption and holding wealth.</p>
<p> Their goal is, given the tax rate, to maximize the discounted weighted consumption &#038; wealth over all the periods of their working life.   I set tax rates at 0%, 10%, 20%, &#8230;  90%, and used Excel&#8217;s solver tool to determine the percentage of wealth they will select under each tax rate.</p>
<p>    Results are as follows:   </p>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TYUPTao4r4Y/T6H1RSEKM8I/AAAAAAAAA10/_gNptJON56Q/s1600/Simulation%252C_Taxes_%2526_Growth.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="210" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TYUPTao4r4Y/T6H1RSEKM8I/AAAAAAAAA10/_gNptJON56Q/s320/Simulation%252C_Taxes_%2526_Growth.jpg" width="320"></a></div>
<p>Figure 1         </p>
<p>Given the parameters selected, here&#8217;s what we find:  the higher the tax rates, the lower the less of their wealth people consume in any given period and overall.  However, the greater the wealth they accumulate&#8230;  which is essentially the story I&#8217;ve been telling to explain the data.   As noted previously, in general, higher taxes lead to faster economic growth.   </p>
<p>A few additional comments: <br />a.  The simulation is simplistic, and it does not show the quadratic relationship between taxation and growth we see in the real world data.  I believe that this can be resolved simply by taking into account satiation resulting from consumption. <br />b.  The simulation indicates that increasing tax rates makes people worse off (the discounted sum of the weighted wealth and consumption tends to be lower for higher tax rates).   <br />b. i.  However, they leave behind more wealth.  Put another way &#8211; individuals in any given period are made worse off, but their descendants are made better off.  <br />b. ii.  A more realistic scenario probably shows increased returns as wealth increases.  (Mr. Romney, to use one example, has investment options available to him that you and I do not, and Mr. Buffett has options available to him that Mr. Romney does not.) Higher taxes might very well make a person worse off today but better off in the long run.  Its great to live during the Gilded Age, a period during which tax rates fell from 75% to 24%&#8230; provided you die before the effect of the Gilded Age spits out the Great Depression.  <br />c.  Because of the way taxes are defined in this model, they play a similar role to compulsory savings.  Put another way:  this model can also explain countries with relatively low taxes but compulsory savings, such as Singapore.   <br />d.  The model also explains Tyler Cowen&#8217;s Great Stagnation.   <br />e.  Government spending does produce a benefit, though that is ignored by this model.     </p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t decided whether I want to spend time improving the simulation tool, but, as usual, if anyone wants my spreadsheet, drop me a line.  I&#8217;m at my first name (mike), my last name (kime), at gmail.</p>

                                <p>by Tom aka Rusty Rustbelt Real Estate Insanity So my son and me are thinking about buying a duplex in Ohio and fixing it up this summer. He would live in half and we would rent the other side. Given the number of foreclosures this should be an easy deal, right? Wrong.  The realtors tell me no one will finance the properties, not even the banks that own them. Why?  It seems many of the banks did not get around to assigning &#8220;asset managers&#8221; for a year or two, which means the water pipes froze in the winter, burst in the spring and destroyed the interior of the properties. Even when asset managers were promptly assigned, many were incompetent and/or corrupt.  So there are many thousands of properties with reasonable looking exteriors but with ruined interiors. Even with sweat equity labor the fix up costs will be very high.  This will eventually be fixed with bulldozers.</p>

<p>Why Tax Cuts for the 1% Are Self-Defeating  </p>
<p><img alt="Why Tax Cuts for the 1% Are Self-Defeating" height="205" src="http://www.policymic.com/articles/5705/photo.jpg" width="325"><br />Annual U.S. income share of the top 1%. </p>
<p>A new <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-gops-ryan-to-unveil-new-budget/2012/03/16/gIQA2dUULS_story.html?wpisrc=nl_wonk">GOP budget</a> released Tuesday brings renewed attention onto the issues of tax policy and the economy. Of course, there will be debate over what effects various policy options would have on the economy, something I have previously addressed in a previous <a href="http://www.policymic.com/articles/3429/tax-cuts-for-the-wealthy-will-not-stimulate-the-economy-government-spending-on-infrastructure-will">article</a>. But inevitably, there will also be arguments made by Republicans regarding the fairness of those policies as well.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The problem with many of the GOP arguments made in regard to fairness is that they lead to a self-defeating paradox in either the logic of the argument, or in the outcomes of their recommended policy solutions. <br />For example, one common argument made is on the grounds that it is unfair for the wealthiest to pay higher taxes since they are already paying the most federal income tax while many people pay none at all. But this argument is flawed in multiple ways. </p>
<p>First of all, the logic of this argument is paradoxical. As the wealthy get wealthier while others <a href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/18/joe-biden/biden-says-middle-income-earners-lost-ground-reces/">fall behind</a> in comparison, the share of tax burden on the wealthy would continually increase. In other words, this logic would suggest that the closer the wealthiest come to earning 100% of total income, the more unfairly they are being treated since their share of income taxes edges closer to 100% as well. And by contrast, it would be considered more fair for the wealthy if their incomes fall while others&#8217; incomes rise, since taxes paid would be more equal. </p>
<p>Second, the big irony here is that the policies that would seem to make it more fair for the wealthy in the short-term (lowering their tax rates at the expense of other policy options) are policies that would tend to further increase income disparity in the long-term. This is due to these policies&#8217; lower effect on creating demand (lower <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_multiplier">economic multiplier</a>), which means less need for labor (a weaker labor market). <br />Let me explain. The wages that average working people can expect depends on the overall demand for labor. If unemployment is very low, businesses must compete harder for labor. People will find more opportunities available, more competing offers, and find it easier to change jobs. This pressures business to offer more competitive wages, among other things.</p>
<p>In other words, policies that facilitate strong demand and thus strong employment lead to higher incomes for labor, which narrows income disparity. This real income growth due to strong employment is something we can see happening in <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/caixin-china-survey-an-era-of-wage-growth-2011-08-18">China</a>, for example. </p>
<p>In addition, this type of stronger income growth will itself fuel stronger demand. We typical refer to this as a strong middle class. The stronger demand it generates in the economy supplants the need for demand-creating policies, which means those polices can be slowly rolled back. This can even happen automatically to an extent, as a larger, wealthier middle class pays more taxes, and that increased revenue can be used even for a tax cut for the wealthiest. </p>
<p>Achieving an ideal conservative vision of the economy and of government tax policy by enacting conservative-favored policies is a self-defeating paradox. Ironically, the path to this ideal conservative outcome can only be achieved by first enacting liberal policies</p>

<p> Still haven&#8217;t filed your FBAR? Don&#8217;t wait till you get hit with forfeiture like this Alaska Plastic Surgeon  </p>
<p>It looks like the leads from the various voluntary disclosures are beginning to pay off, as the U.S. is beginning to develop high stakes cases related to Americans who have tried to maintain secret caches of cash offshore&#8211;to hide from the taxman and from their ex-spouses! The forfeiture complaint in the case, filed Feb. 9, 2012 in California&#8217;s Central District, is available <a href="http://www.assetprotectionbook.com/casedocs/brandner/001_Complaint_09feb12.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The government seized $4.656 million belonging to Michael and Sheila Brandner (he&#8217;s the plastic surgeon) from an account at Bank of America in the name of Evergreen Capital LLC, an entity set up by Brandner and under his (hidden) control. The government&#8217;s tale is a sordid one&#8211;In the middle of Brandner&#8217;s divorce proceedings in May 2008, he drove to Panama where he deposited checks worth about $3.5 million in a non-US bank, with the purpose of concelaing the assets from his soon-to-be ex-wife. A person who became a &#8220;cooperating witness&#8221; helped him open the account and told him about the FBAR requirement, but Brandner didn&#8217;t file the required report. A few months later, Brandner transferred an additional $1.4 million, mostly from his pension fund, to that account (also to conceal it from his wife. The pension fund was awarded to his wife in the divorce proceedings, and when Brandner learned that the Panama account might be susceptible to discovery, Brandner moved the money through wire deposits in 2011 into the Bank of America account of Evergreen Capital, allegedly to conceal it from the IRS and from his ex-wife.</p>

<p>As the Atkinson story notes, this mess was doubly stupid. It was stupid of the surgeon to try to cheat his wife of assets and it was really stupid to do it in a way that could well ultimately subject him to criminal charges. See Jay Atkinson, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jayadkisson/2012/03/17/brandner-alaska-plastic-surgeon-faces-forfeiture-of-4-656-million-for-undisclosed-offshore-account-used-to-attempt-to-cheat-ex-wife/">Brandner: Alaska Plastic Surgeon Faces Forfeiture Of $4.656 Million For Undisclosed Offshore Account Used To Attempt To Cheat Ex-Wife</a>, Forbes (Mar. 17, 2012). Anybody else that is still waiting out there with millions in an undeclared offshore account, watch out. The time to file and pay up has arrived.</p>

                                <p>Simon Johnson at <i>Baseline Scenario </i> writes in <a href="http://baselinescenario.com/2012/03/02/making-the-united-states-more-like-greece/">Making the United States More Like Greece</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>One of the big problems in Greece over the past decade or so is that the government was not honest with its data. Various people assisted in the matter – including Goldman Sachs with respect to some debt issues – but ultimately this was a political decision at the highest level. The people running the country decided to conceal the true nature of their budget and their debt. This deception ended up costing the country dearly – completely undermining its credibility under pressure and making it much harder to turn the fiscal and economic situation around.<br />…<br />In the modern United States, cutting taxes leads to lower revenue and larger budget deficits. There are no two ways about this – as Ronald Reagan discovered in the early 1980s. (In our new book, <em><a href="http://whitehouseburning.com/">White House Burning</a></em>, we go through the evidence on this point in detail, including important work by Greg Mankiw, former top economic adviser to George W. Bush and now working with Mitt Romney, which confirms that cutting taxes in the U.S. will lower revenue.)<br />But many Republicans feel that this is not true – in my conversations with them, for example in congressional hearings over the past year, the conviction seems to be that the research on this topic is bad science, even when done by Republicans. But convincing the CBO to abandon its proven and sensible approach to budget scoring has been difficult.<br />&#8230;<br />The solution currently under consideration is simple in its elegance – and downright frightening in its implications.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>This article in the New York Times (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/us/even-critics-of-safety-net-increasingly-depend-on-it.html?pagewanted=1" target="_blank">Even critics of the Safety Net</a>) presents a gentle desription of some voter feelings about the political and economic &#8216;issues&#8217; of this economy and election. I have a lot of different feelings about the description of people interviewed.  The current media surrounding the election campaigning does not allow for voter foibles and confusions, and appears to demand stark responses so far.  I do wish the author could have pressed for more thinking on the part of the people interviewed to illustrate how such ambivalence plays out in real life.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:  I will have a post taking a look at the author&#8217;s writing, which is actually a piece of propaganda if you follow the statements of &#8216;fact&#8217; and lack of easily added context for the figures and stated problems.  Hence the author chose (or the editors, perhaps) instead  to promote the confusions without educating readers or those interviewed.</p>

                                <p>Romney’s Tax Proposal
<p>The <a href="http://taxpolicycenter.org/taxtopics/romney-plan.cfm">Tax Policy Center</a> provides its review of which taxpayers will pay more and which ones will pay less under the tax proposal introduced by Mitt Romney. A really short summary goes as follows:</p>
<p>(a) The well to do will pay less in taxes;   <br />(b) The working poor will pay more in taxes; and   <br />(c) Overall tax revenue will be significantly reduced. </p>
<p>But wasn’t that also the case for the Herman Cain tax proposal as well as any other tax proposal from the Republican candidates for President? And the Republicans claim they are for fiscal responsibility! </p>
