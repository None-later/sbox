				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>by Linda Beale</p>
<p>Corporations Don&#8217;t Need More Tax Breaks</p>
<p>If you listen to the corporate lobbyists, and the right-wingers who plead their cases for them in Congress and in the media, you&#8217;d think that corporations are so heavily taxed that it is threatening their ability to continue to conduct business and be competitive in world markets. But is that really the case? This blog has often pointed out two obvious shortcomings in the corporate whine: first, the corporate statutory rate of 35% is honored in the breach&#8211;most corporations pay actual tax rates so significantly lower than 35% that the statutory rate is an illusion; and second, as far as global competitiveness is concerned, the corporate tax rate is the only significant tax that US corporations pay, whereas most other countries have both corporate income taxes and VAT taxes, often paid at each transactional stage of production.</p>
<p>A site called &#8220;NerdWallet&#8221; provides considerable information based on analysis of the financial statements of companies, providing greater transparency for investors and, lucky for us, for those of us interested in tax facts.   See, e.g., the NerdWallet study, <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/corporate-taxes-only-9-percent/">Top Companies Paid 9% Tax Rate </a>(July 24, 2012).<br />
<blockquote>Because tax provision includes both domestic and foreign, current and deferred taxes, NerdWallet researched further to find how much was actually paid by these American companies to the U.S. federal government in the most recent tax year.  By dividing the current portion of federal taxes by pre-tax income, NerdWallet was able to calculate the percentage of these companies’ earnings that was paid to the U.S. government. <strong>For the ten American companies with highest earnings in the most recent fiscal year, this number averaged 9%. NerdWallet Study (emphasis added).</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>A press release about the study notes just how much corporate taxation has shrunk as a source of revenue in the US, as corporations pay lower rates than ordinary Americans.<br />
<blockquote>A new <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/corporate-taxes-only-9-percent/">NerdWallet study</a> found the 10 most profitable U.S. companies paid an average of just 9% in federal taxes last year. These low rates are particularly shocking given that the official tax rate is 35%. The study also revealed that more than half of the 500 largest U.S. companies <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/markets/2012/individual-vs-corporate-taxes/">paid a lower tax rate</a> than the average American.  NerdWallet press release (July 30 2012).</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>NerdWallet also has a very useful tool for seeing what each major corporation of the top 500 actually pays in taxes, available <a href="http://www.nerdwallet.com/markets/corporate-taxes/general-electric-co">here</a>. You can scroll through a list of corporations to select a particular one of interest, and the tool will show the actual rate of taxes paid to the U.S. government, the compensation paid to the CEO, and the average compensation for the company&#8217;s employees, as well as the multiple of the CEO compensation to the average employee compensation. For example, the tool provides the following information for several of the largest of the 500 corporations.<br />
<blockquote>1. Exxon Mobil Pre-tax Earnings: $73.3 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $1.5 Billion (2%)<br />2. Chevron Pre-tax Earnings: $46.6 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $1.9 Billion (4%)<br />3. Apple Pre-tax Earnings: $34.2 Billion Actual Taxes Paid $3.9 Billion (11%)<br />4. Microsoft Pre-tax Earnings: $28.1 Billion Actual Taxes Paid: $3.1 Billion (11%)<br />5. JPMorgan Chase &#038; Co Pre-tax Earnings: $26.7 Billion Actual Taxes Paid $3.7 Billion (14%)</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;ve already seen in previous installments of this series that since about 1980, I: <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/where-has-all-money-gone-pt-i-corporate.html">corporate profits have soared</a>, II: the slice of profits going to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/where-has-all-money-gone-part-ii.html">finance has soared even more</a>, and III:  <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/where-has-all-money-gone-pt-iii-not-to.html">wages have stagnated</a>.   Here we see what corporations have done with all that money.   There is  a limited selection set: pay taxes, distribute as dividends, pay down  debt, invest, make acquisitions, speculate, and hold as cash.</p>
<p>Here is a look at taxes through 2008 and dividends through 2010, as percentages of profits; data from BEA table 7.16, lines 19, 20 and 38.   For my purposes, profits are divided among taxes, dividends, and all the other things mentioned above, which I&#8217;ll call the Residual.</p>
<p>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j6er29Fe_bQ/TzBDTWVxg0I/AAAAAAAABwQ/I7UsHaXxtCw/s1600/Corp+Divs+and+Taxes+by+Profits.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-j6er29Fe_bQ/TzBDTWVxg0I/AAAAAAAABwQ/I7UsHaXxtCw/s400/Corp+Divs+and+Taxes+by+Profits.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />Dividends/ Profits are in green; Taxes/Profits in red.  I&#8217;ve added 13  year moving averages to clarify the trends over time.  The Dividend  percentage bottomed in 1978 at 20.6%.  I&#8217;ve marked that year on both  curves with a yellow dot.  After that, dividend payments took off  sharply and have been mostly in the 40 to 50 % range since 1989.  The  tax rate on dividends was reduced to 15% in 2003, also marked with a  yellow dot, but I don&#8217;t think that change has had much effect on  dividend payout.  The gyrations in the payout percentage since 2003 are  largely due to the denominator affect, as profitability increased after  the 2001-2 recession, and plummeted during the recent Great Recession.   Notably, 2010 profits are the highest ever.  <br />  <br />The tax  payout drop lagged the dividend increase by several years, and didn&#8217;t  start dropping until 1987.   In 1986, the tax payout rate was 45.2%.   After a sharp drop to 27.7% in 1992, the payout rate increased  throughout the Clinton administration, topping at 34.5% in 2000.  Then,  there was another sharp drop.  It has since leveled off, averaging 25%  since 2004.</p>
<p>In 1978, the 13 year averages were 24.2%  for dividends and 42.4% for taxes.  Those averages are now <strike>28.3, and dropping; and 45.7 and rising, respectively</strike>  45.7 and rising for dividends; and 28.3% and dropping for taxes &#8211; essentially a reversal of  positions.  The net result is a massive funneling of money from  government to dividend recipients who now are paying only 15% tax on  their dividend income.</p>
<p>This is not only &#8220;<a href="http://www.independent.org/pdf/tir/tir_12_01_01_bartlett.pdf">Starve the Beast</a>&#8221;  in action, it is a massive redistribution of wealth into the hands of  those who already have the most.   Say what you will about the relative  efficiencies of the private and public sectors in using resources, the  public sector places money into the hands of people who will spend it  and keep the economy moving.  The private sector largely funnels it into rent  seeking.</p>
<p>For the sake of completeness, here is a look  at the Residual &#8211; as defined above &#8211; with a 13 year moving average and a  best fit straight trend line.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AdevbuIhMRo/TzBKtkku_SI/AAAAAAAABwY/xsb5pCCmHa8/s1600/Corp+D-T+Residual+by+Profits.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AdevbuIhMRo/TzBKtkku_SI/AAAAAAAABwY/xsb5pCCmHa8/s400/Corp+D-T+Residual+by+Profits.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p>This provides a partial explanation for <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/guest-post-does-lower-corporate-tax.html">Jon Hammond&#8217;s observation</a> that net corporate investment has been down over the duration.  There is less residual to invest.</p>
<p>Bottom  line:  Corporate profits have been skewed to dividend payments, to the  detriment of worker salaries, government tax revenues, and corporate  investment.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><u>INTRODUCTION</u></p>
<p>1) Rethug Speaker of the House John Boehner says that as a nation, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-creamer/no-mr-boehner-america-is_b_823304.html">&#8220;we&#8217;re broke</a>&#8220;; Rethug presidential candidate Ron Paul claims America &#8220;<a href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/rep-ron-paul-america-should-declare-bankruptcy/">should declare bankruptcy</a>.&#8221;  I say these two are liars, and at least one of them is crazy.</p>
<p>2) Tyler Cowan says &#8220;<a href="http://conhomeusa.typepad.com/bigideas/2011/02/tyler-cowen-.html">we are poorer than we think we are</a>,&#8221; due to mis-measurement of value, which might be true.  I believe his prescription for recovery is generally very bad, though.</p>
<p>3) In comments to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/matt-stoller-former-senior-policy.html">my previous Angry Bear post</a>, Bob McManus directed us to the writings of Michael Hudson, where we find his post <a href="http://michael-hudson.com/2011/12/democracy-and-debt/">Democracy and Debt</a>.   This is must reading.  The relevant point here is that the increasing  capture of wealth, as rents, by a creditor class impoverishes society in  general, and this eventually leads to severe repression, major social  upheaval, or both.  <a href="http://jazzbumpa.blogspot.com/2011/04/brute-economics-of-slavery.html">I whole-heartedly agree</a>.</p>
<p>4) Jon Hammond&#8217;s <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/01/guest-post-does-lower-corporate-tax.html">guest post at Angry Bear </a>shows that a more-or-less continuous decrease in real investment has occurred during the post WW II era.</p>
<p>In  this series of posts, I intend to show that we are a wealthy nation,  but that our wealth  has been increasingly captured by elite creditors,  who, in my opinion, are strangling the economy by 1) extracting  excessive rents and 2) diverting this wealth to financial tail chasing,  rather than real investment.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><u>WHERE THE MONEY HASN&#8217;T GONE </u></p>
<p>Here is a look at average hourly earnings, the typical income of a working stiff, presented on a log scale.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=4ks"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=4ks" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Like almost every time series you can imagine, <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=4kt">including GDP</a>,  it exhibits a break near 1980.   The break is always to lower growth.   But, compared to most other data series, this break is especially sharp.</p>
<p>Hear  is the same series compared to GDP, an approximate measure of the  income of the nation, on a linear scale.  For this graph, each is  normalized to a value of 100 in Q1, 1965.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=4kr"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=4kr" width="400"></a></div>
<p>While earnings have grown less than 8 times in 47 years, GDP has grown more than 20 times.</p>
<p>Clearly,  the money has not gone to compensation of the workers whose labor  actually creates the wealth of the nation.  That might explain some of <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/01/12/be-vewy-vewy-quiet/">the alleged envy</a>.</p>
<p><u>CORPORATE PROFITS</u></p>
<p>As a first step in  finding where the money has gone, let&#8217;s consider the growth of corporate  after-tax profits since about 1950.  You can see it in <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=4j9">this FRED graph</a>.    It&#8217;s on a log scale, so constant growth would be a straight line.   There are lots of wiggles, but I see an increasing slope over time, and  it&#8217;s not an optical illusion.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0RbG_1gQUYM/Tw3ddKHUaoI/AAAAAAAABvQ/Q_Yy2WdP7TU/s1600/Corp+Profits+Jan+2012.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0RbG_1gQUYM/Tw3ddKHUaoI/AAAAAAAABvQ/Q_Yy2WdP7TU/s400/Corp+Profits+Jan+2012.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p>There  are a lot of ways to parse this.  One is to connect the dip bottoms  with straight lines.  I&#8217;ve done that with alternating red and blue to  show the slope increasing over time.  The problem is selecting which  bottoms to connect.  Some alternate choices are indicated in yellow.   The yellow lines define times of above normal profit growth: 1970 to  1980, 1986 to 1998, and 2001 through 2007.  Each of them leads to a  correction, indicated by a purple line across the top of the decline.</p>
<p>After  I did all that, it occurred to me to let Excel throw an exponential  best fit line on the data set, and you can see that as well.</p>
<p>I  see now that I could have included another yellow line from 1961 to  1967.  Notice that with each yellow line, the data set advances above  the exponential best fit line before a sideways correction takes it  below again.  After the correction is complete, profits increase again  until the best fit curve is breached.  Or, they did until now.</p>
<p>Remember  that on a log scale constant growth rate is represented by a straight  line, and that the growth compounds, so that the underlying increase is  exponential.  Sooner or later, that has to end.  Nothing in the real  word can go to infinity.  Here we see an exponential curve on a log  scale.  This demonstrates an increasing growth rate.  Therefore, the  underlying increase is greater than exponential.  If exponential growth  is unsustainable, what would you say about greater than exponential  growth?</p>
<p>In fact, the whole trend might now be falling  apart, as the last blue line has a much lower slope.  Also, for the  first time following a correction, profits have stayed below the trend  line, and the gap is increasing.</p>
<p>To show the extent of  national income capture by corporations, here is a graph of corporate  profits as a percentage of GDP.   I&#8217;ve divided the set into two  segments: 1951 to 1979, and 1980 on, and had Excel place a linear trend  line on each.  This division is somewhat arbitrary, but almost every  economic time series you can find has a break point within a few years  of 1980.  Division between &#8217;79 and &#8217;80 is the least favorable to my  point that Profits/GDP had no trend in the post WW II Golden Age, but  have trended sharply upward during the Great Stagnation period.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0DQTBTXwI3M/Tw3lMSmUMDI/AAAAAAAABvY/FMm1xzEdTNE/s1600/Corp+Prof+by+GDP.JPG"><img border="0" height="298" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-0DQTBTXwI3M/Tw3lMSmUMDI/AAAAAAAABvY/FMm1xzEdTNE/s400/Corp+Prof+by+GDP.JPG" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Profit/GDP  growth was unusually poor from 1980 through 1986.  Then from late 2001  through early 2006 it exhibited the greatest growth ever.  But remember  the denominator effect.  <a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?g=4jc">Nominal GDP growth</a> increased rapidly following the &#8217;80-&#8217;82 double recession; while GDP  growth in this century has been generally slow.  The financial melt-down  of 2008 caused a dip that was sharp and brief, but the rebound has not  gone to a new high.  But even now, in the midst of anemic recovery,  profit/GDP is hovering in the 9 to 10% range, far above historical  norms. </p>
<p><u>CONCLUSION</u></p>
<p>The  corporate profit growth picture looks unsustainable, and that is  troubling.  What it means for the future is anybody&#8217;s guess.  But, what  we get from it is the first partial answer to the question, &#8220;Where has  all the money gone?&#8221;</p>
<p>Gone to profits, everyone.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some of the biggest companies in the United States have been firing workers and in some cases lobbying for rules that depress wages at the very time that jobs are needed, pay is low, and the federal budget suffers from a lack of revenue.<br />Last month Citizens for Tax Justice and an affiliate issued <a href="http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2011/11/ctj.html">Corporate Taxpayers and Corporate Tax Dodgers 2008-10</a>. It showed that 30 brand-name companies paid a federal income tax rate of minus 6.7% on $160 billion of profit from 2008 through 2010 compared to a going corporate tax rate of 35%. All but one of those 30 companies reported lobbying expenses in Washington. Another report, by Public Campaign, <a href="http://link.reuters.com/zef65s">shows that 29 of those companies spent nearly half a billion dollars</a> over those three years lobbying in Washington for laws and rules that favor their interests. &#8230; The report – “For Hire: Lobbyists or the 99 percent” – says that while shedding jobs, the 30 companies are “spending millions of dollars on Washington lobbyists to stave off higher taxes or regulations.”<br />….<br />Company reports to shareholders show that among the 30 companies in the Public Campaign report, the 10 firms that spent the most on lobbying during the same three-year period fired more than 93,000 American workers. &#8230;</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday in the <em>New York Times</em> Greg Mankiw &#8212; a professor of economics at Harvard, an advisor to the governor of Massachusetts, in the campaign for the Republican presidential nomination and a former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under president Bush &#8212; had a column in which he argued that a cut in the corporate tax rate would induce greater investment. This is a key premise of Republican campaigns that has driven Republican policy since the early 1980s. The article is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/11/business/business-investment-as-a-key-to-recovery.html?_r=1">here</a>.</p>
<p>We should look at the record and see how well such cuts to corporate taxes actually  has worked.</p>
<p><em>First, average corporate profits versus tax business pays.</em> Contrary to the statutory rate of 39% widely quoted, the effective rate corporations actually pay is now about 22%. That is down from about 50% in 1950 and a local peak of some 44% in the early 1980s. The right likes to compare the statutory rate to other advanced countries statutory rate and claim that the US has about the highest corporate tax among advanced countries. But according to a recent study by the US Treasury the US effective rate is in about the middle of the pack of effective rates for advanced countries.<br /><a name="more"></a></p>

<p><em>Second, let&#8217;s look at after tax profits as a percent of GDP</em>. Despite cyclical swing there has been a strong secular trend since 1950. From 1950 to the early 1980s taxes as a percent of GDP declined from about 10% of GDP to under 4%. Since 1980 it has rebounded from under 4% back to about 10% of GDP and this measure appears to be on the verge of breaking out to a new record high.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hnBB05kYqEg/Tmvjj8TfCxI/AAAAAAAABvE/iyB8Uln6R7A/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-hnBB05kYqEg/Tmvjj8TfCxI/AAAAAAAABvE/iyB8Uln6R7A/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Next look at <em>business investment as a share of GDP </em>. Again, despite cyclical swings there appears to be a secular trend. From 1950 to 1981 it rose and reached an all time peak of 14% in the early 1980s. Since 1980 it has been trending down from 14% and is now back to about the 10% level it was at in 1950.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0pVj6DjDgxE/TmvgPCNj74I/AAAAAAAABu8/nVla0eObRg4/s1600/Clipboard03.bmp"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0pVj6DjDgxE/TmvgPCNj74I/AAAAAAAABu8/nVla0eObRg4/s320/Clipboard03.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a></p>
<p>&#8230;and compare it to <em>taxes as a percent of GDP</em>. Note the secular swing in investment is the exact opposite of the secular trend in profits. From 1950 to 1980 profits fell and investment rose. Since 1980 profits rose and investment fell. This is the exact opposite of Mankiw&#8217;s theory that cutting corporate taxes will lead to higher investments.</p>
<p>Mankiw writes a column for the NY Times every few weeks. Maybe in his next column he can explain why we should ignore this evidence that directly contradicts his theory.</p>
<p>His theory appears to be like the supply side theory that if we cut personal taxes on savings that people will save more. Since 1980 we have created IRA and other instruments that allow consumers to save on a tax free basis and increase their returns. So what happened to the personal savings rate over this period, it fell from 14% to almost 0%. This has to be about the greatest failure of an economic theory since communism. Remember, Milton Friedman said the most important test of a theory is how its forecasts work. Using Friedman&#8217;s basis the supply side theory about personal savings was a abject failure.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m going to surprise you by saying that I completely agree with Mankiw that corporate profits taxes should be cut. But of course there is a catch.</p>
<p>What I want corporations to pay taxes on is their profits as defined by the Generally Accepted Accounting Procedures (GAAP) rather than profits as defined by the IRS. Congress does not establish GAAP so this change would massively cut the ability of Congress to create loopholes or special cases in the tax code. As a consequence incentives for firms to buy-off politicians would be massively reduced. If you are a corporate CEO would rather use the money you now have to spend on Washington lobbyist and expensive tax lawyers to actually expand your business. My primary objective is to reduce the power of corporate money in politics and if Mankiw is right that it increases investment all the better.</p>
<p>Almost to a man Republican and business leaders strongly agree that the US should not have industrial planning. Politicians should not be in the business of picking winner and losers. But the US has a major industrial planning system, it is just that we call it the federal tax code. And generally the critics are right, Washington does a poor job of picking winners and losers.</p>
<p>According to the GAO the industries with the highest effective tax rates like information technology are frequently the fastest growing industries. Moreover the slowest growing industries, like oil, have the lowest effective tax rate. The GAO estimate that the oil industries&#8217; effective tax rate is about 11%, or about half the overall corporate tax rate.</p>
<p>Apparently oil executives learned decades ago that the get a much higher return on their capital if they use it to buy political favors rather that actually drilling for more oil. Surprisingly, domestic oil production actually rose in 2009 and 2010. This is the first consecutive annual increase in domestic oil production since Carter was president and oil faced price controls and windfall profits taxes. Maybe the oil executives realized they could not buy-off Obama and decided that to grow  profits they had to do something really radical, like increasing domestic oil production.</p>
