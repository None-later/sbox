                                <p>With thanks to <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/" target="_blank">Felix Salmon</a> for arranging the invitation.
<p>There’s an episode of <em>House </em>where he has to get rid of one of the people for his new team.  By the end of the episode, the sharpest person in the group has said everything that we would have expected to hear from House—and is therefore summarily dismissed, since hearing one’s own opinions being spoken by someone else is less useful than being challenged.</p>
<p>I had a similar feeling with George Soros’s conversation last Wednesday morning with Chrystia Freeland, sponsored by Reuters and held in the NASDAQ building that, er, graces Times Square. So what follows isn’t everything Soros said so much as what he said that either (1) you wouldn’t already know from reading this blog or Paul Krugman or (2) added details or touched on an interesting issue.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/soros-obama-and-me/">finds another similarity between himself and Mr. Soros</a>.</p>
<h4>The Recent Crisis and Its Causes</h4>
<p>Soros declares that there was twenty-five to thirty (25-30) years of a “Super Bubble,” which has now burst.  It seems from the discussion that Soros believes the SuperBubble was worldwide.  Recovery is being hindered by some policies—Germany’s talk about austerity was especially mentioned—by Soros sees strong hope in the Trade Shift that has accompanied the crisis. He noted that the “global economy is a lot better than the US economy,” and that he expects to see it continue growing even if the U.S. (or Europe, due to the German leadership, or even both) fall into a :double-dip.” (In this he is arguably more of an optimist than many.)</p>
<h4>China I</h4>
<p>Key to this shift has been the growth of bilateral relationships.  He noted obliquely that these developed in part because many governments—most especially the Chinese, who have been “the great beneficiary of globalization”—do not want to change their capital controls, but sees them as facilitating the new paradigm. He expects that the next move will be that Hong Kong (with the HKD remaining independent of the RMB) will become as London did in the 1960s and 1970s, the intermediary of choice for the growing market (now China, then Europe).</p>
<p>There is a strong need to increase Chinese domestic demand, which he rightly expects is being partially facilitated by the recent wage increases. While there is a need to shift from the previous US-Chinese symbiotic relationship (essentially, bonds for exports), Mr. Soros is “not sure there will be” further advancement in that relationship without greater domestic Chinese consumption. He declared that the Chinese economy has become “the motor” of the world economy, but also noted that it is a smaller motor, so the world economy is not moving so fast.</p>
<h4>Currencies</h4>
<p>In that context, he was asked by a gentleman from Fidelity Capital if it is time to move from the USD to a “basket” as the World Reserve Currency. (As regular readers know, this is an issue near and dear to my heart.) Stating the obvious, Soros noted that having “a more neutral currency” (which may not be an exact quote) would be helpful in correcting the imbalances, which are largely due to the dollar being the International Reserve Currency. He agreed that a basket Reserve Currency would improve the market. (I—and I suspect <a href="http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">David Beckworth</a>—might agree that it would provide for easier <em>remedies</em>, but I’m not convinced it would provide for a better market, since arbitrage opportunities and issues of asymmetric information would be more likely to skew outcomes.)</p>
<h4>China II</h4>
<p>Soros is very sympathetic to the Chinese people themselves.  He notes that they work hard but that their labor is harnessed to an undervalued currency to the benefit of the State. He described the Chinese mercantile system as being “State Capitalism,” which he calls a “very powerful” model, while also noting that it is not so good as the previous “International Capitalism.” Since he noted that “International Capitalism”; is synonymous with “the Washington Consensus,” this leaves him having damned China with very faint praise.  (Though, in fairness, he is even more negative about Russia, which he described to Jim Holt as an example of <em>unsuccessful </em>State Capitalism, whose success or failure is primarily driven by the price of oil. He also sees a real possibility of China developing into an Open Society—another point on which he is rather an optimist.)</p>
<p>Where he is not positive about China is its Real Estate market, which is skewed in part due to the political structure. The Chinese version of mercantilism allows government officials to own three (3) properties, which has been a very good way for those workers to get rich through selling and “trading up.”  The primary solution to this bubble, he believes, would be initiating a property tax, which would produce a carrying cost on properties and therefore mitigate the speculative aspects of the bubble. (Soros essentially notes that, as with the United States, labor is overtaxed and capital undertaxed in China.  Since China has excess productive labor, the benefits flow to the state.  Implicitly, the U.S.’s excess produced the differential model discussed above, which worked well for both parties for some fifteen (15) years.)</p>
<p>But all is not  bread and roses in Soros’s view of China.  An Indian journalist sitting next to me asked the obvious question: Has being a democratic country “hamstrung” India as compared to China? Soros came back to his key theme of the need for growth in Chinese domestic demand, noting that the Indian economy is more stable precisely because there is now domestic growth—growth that will be facilitated in China only as that State evolves both politically and economically. He noted that the Chinese people, to date, have been willing to accept limits on their individual freedom for its benefit in growth, but he does not see other countries being willing to accept such limits on their own freedom to support China’s growth.  If I ever had any doubt that Soros is a more devoted Popperian than I, it was eliminated in that moment.</p>
<h4>Other Powers, and Some That Might Be</h4>
<p>Soros spoke positively of Turkey (Dani Rodrik <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rodrik48/English" target="_blank">may have a counterpoint</a>), negatively of Germany (from a policy perspective; when asked by a reporter from Crain’s what we will look back on and see as stupid, he replied that “fiscal rectitude, from a timing point of view, is wrong.”), and generally positively of the Euro, declaring in response to a question about Ireland and Greece that “If anybody would leave [the Eurozone] it would be Germany.”</p>
<p>His key point about the Euro is one that is often found in the literature of financial crises, including the previous Great Depression: there is a European Central Bank, but there is not a central Treasury. But this appears to be <em>de facto</em> being remedied by the Solvency Crisis, with “back-up funds” being developed and used.  Soros noted a key distinction that is often missed in discussions: there was not a crisis of the EUR, but rather a European <em>banking</em> crisis, which was exacerbated by policy disagreements between France and Germany. (Germany won, though his view of whether this victory will be relatively Pyrrhic is left as an exercise.)</p>
<p>Again, he looks to the Chinese as an indicator, who started putting their money—you know, that 4 Trillion RMB stimulus and the revenues that have followed it—into the EUR as soon as it reached around 1.20.  The Chinese bought the EUR, the Chinese bought Spanish bonds, the Chinese stabilized the market.  The Chinese did something no one else can do for them—bought another currency on the open market.</p>
<p>And this is the key to understanding Soros’s attitude toward Japan. You think this is easy, realism? The Japanese are correct to worry about their currency, Soros notes, because, while the RMB is the strongest currency in the world, you cannot own it because of capital controls that the Chinese government maintains because they do not want to have both rising wages and an appreciating currency in their export-based economy. Accordingly, per Soros, any appreciation of the RMB “has to be done in an orderly manner.” In the meantime, the Japanese did the only thing they could.</p>
<h4>U.S. Politics</h4>
<p>Mr. Soros was by no means a fan of the Obama Administration. Echoing Glenn Greenwald, he notes that the Obama Administration should have corrected the excesses, the abuse of power, of the Bush Administration. Despite this (and what follows), Soros believes Obama “may well be elected to a second term.”</p>
<p>As a matter of handling the banks through the crisis, Mr. Soros noted that the Administration should have injected Equity into the banks, but notes that he believes the Obama team found this politically unacceptable. The result is that the government effectively nationalized the banks’s <em>liabilities</em> and “allowed” them to “earn their way out of that hole,” through practices such as increasing consumer credit card rates.</p>
<p>(My memory of the events is somewhat different, since part of what the Fed received for its TARP funds were warrants on those banks—warrants that have subsequently been sold and counted as if the revenue against the original loans to make them appear more “profitable” in the eyes of several bloggers and financial journalists [including, for instance, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/why-do-i-predict-tarp-less.html" target="_blank">Robert</a>]. But certainly there was no AIG-like structure imposed, no U.S. equivalent of Northern Rock, no matter how much saner than would have been.)  </p>
<p>To no one’s great surprise, Mr. Soros does not believe that Mr. Obama is “anti-business.”</p>
<p>The biggest fault he found with the Administration’s approach to the crisis is that they depended on the “confidence multiplier” to make recession shallower and shorter than it otherwise would have been. The problem with a <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/01/blanchard_roundtable_1" target="_blank">confidence multiplier</a> is, of course, that when the results do not match the expectations, the “multiplier” becomes a disappointment, and therefore a drag on expectations going forward. Mr. Soros described this as what happened.</p>
<p>If this scenario is true, then the decision not to ask initially for a $1.2T stimulus, with a chance to end up with a better mix and higher absolute amount of actual stimulus funding, will go down as the tombstone for the Administration, not “just” a spanner in <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/09/20/obama-raises-prospects-of-new-economic-team/" target="_blank">the possible continuation of the Administration’s economic team</a> (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Mark Thoma</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/MarkThoma" target="_blank">Twitter</a>).  But, hey, the recession <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/current-doldrums-are-just-jobless-sales.html" target="_blank">has been over for more than a year</a>, so things are getting better, with the upcoming elections more resembling the signpost of 1982 than 1932.  At least in some timestream.</p>
<h4>Gold</h4>
<p>This one was pulled all over the place, so it should come as no surprise.  Gold is, per Mr. Soros, the only active “bull market” right now.  He is also not optimistic about the ending of that market. Gold is “the ultimate bubble”—may be going higher, but is certainly not safe and is not going to be forever.</p>
<p>Mr. Soros admits a similar attitude toward oil, but at least there the commodity has intrinsic value. As Vincent Fernando, CFA, notes, owning something other than gold at least gives you the possibility of “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gold-owner-vs-business-owner-2010-9" target="_blank">productive assets</a>.”</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>I’ve left out a few things, including the roundelay that resulted when one journalist attempted to discuss Mr. Soros’s firm’s holdings in a company he said he didn’t the firm owns. But in general the feeling one gets when presented by Mr. Soros the person is that he is an optimist, perhaps incurably so. Things are rough, and they will probably continue to be rough for a while, but in the longer term, things are getting better for all.</p>
<p>I’m guessing he won’t be speaking at <a href="http://www.keepfearalive.com/" target="_blank">The March to Keep Fear Alive</a>.  But Mr. Colbert—let alone his predecessor at the Washington Monument—would do well to book him as a guest.</p>

                                <p>Reader benamery 21 comments on US energy consumption from a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/07/increasing-internal-demand-in-china-for.html">previous post at Angry Bear</a> on a better picture of what drives energy consumption in China.  The NYT article used air conditioning and shopping malls as one metaphor for the good life that the Chinese are striving for, but he would advise caution for those wanting to Americanize our image of China at least in the short term (decades).</p>
<blockquote><p>Residential air conditioning is only 2.8% of U.S. energy consumption (including electrical system losses at 31.5% system efficiency), and the average occupied square feet is a LOT bigger than a Chinese apartment.  A/C isn&#8217;t the U.S. energy monster, that&#8217;s the private automobile.  A/C uses less energy than residential space heating (5%) or water heating (3.0%) or appliance use (9.4%).  It takes on importance from an energy perspective because it drives electricity PEAK demand (not total energy consumption) in large parts of the country.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>It&#8217;s useful to look at how coal is used in China to assess what future demand may look like. Unlike the US, less than half of China&#8217;s coal is used for power generation, so while important, electricity demand is not the sole driver of coal demand. <br />China uses almost half as much coal for coking to drive its huge iron &#038; steel industry, so that portion of demand will depend on the outlook for steel, half of which is now used in buildings and infrastructure. <br />Also unlike the US, China devotes a lot of coal use to district heating (&#8220;other transformation&#8221; in the graph) in the northern cold climate zones, and that portion is expected to grow only modestly as building reforms increase the efficiency of heat use in buildings. <br />For direct end-use of coal, that is almost all in industry, particularly the cement industry (residential use has fallen to about 80 million tonnes).<br />Given many saturation effects driving both construction and end-use of electricity by 2020, we don&#8217;t see coal continuing its dramatic rise of the last few years. 2010 probably marks the peak of cement production.<br />Under a depletion curve defined by China&#8217;s declared 189 billion tonnes of reserves from the 2003-2005 National Resource Survey, China is currently on what I call a &#8220;sharp peak&#8221; production profile that could reach 3.6 to 3.8 billion tonnes, but not for long.<br />The units in the following graph are in China&#8217;s standard measurement of &#8220;tonnes of coal equivalent&#8221; where 1 tce = 1.37 tonnes raw coal.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>A shift to more internal demand for China might not benefit the US in ways we think it will.  One such area is the impact of increased demand for resources and energy.  And another is where the jobs are.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://247wallst.com/2010/07/09/china-puts-up-more-money-to-build-solar-capacity-yge-stp-tsl-wfr-fslr-spwra/">China Puts Up More Money to Build Solar Capacity</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The government-owned China Development Bank has just made its third massive loan to one of the country’s solar energy makers, bringing its total commitment about $17 billion. The combined size of the loans is large enough to allow China to double the global manufacturing capability for solar wafers and cells.  The latest recipient of the government’s largess is Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. Ltd. (NYSE:YGE), which today announced that had received an aggregate line of credit from the China Development Bank worth about $5.3 billion. In April, Suntech Power Holdings (NYSE:STP) and Trina Solar Ltd. (NYSE:TSL) received loans of $7.3 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/05/business/global/05warm.html?_r=1">The NYT</a> points to energy use, efficiency, and China (Rdan&#8230;the emphasis is on global warming but needn&#8217;t be):</p>
<blockquote><p>Already, in the last three years, China has shut down more than a thousand older coal-fired power plants that used technology of the sort still common in the United States. China has also surpassed the rest of the world as the biggest investor in wind turbines and other clean energy technology. And it has dictated tough new energy standards for lighting and gas mileage for cars. </p>
<p>But even as Beijing imposes the world’s most rigorous national energy campaign, the effort is being overwhelmed by the billionfold demands of Chinese consumers. <br />&#8230;<br />Aspiring to a more Western standard of living, in many cases with the government’s encouragement, China’s population, 1.3 billion strong, is clamoring for more and bigger cars, for electricity-dependent home appliances and for more creature comforts like air-conditioned shopping malls. <br />&#8230;<br />Chinese cars get 40 percent better gas mileage on average than American cars because they tend to be much smaller and have weaker engines. And China is drafting regulations that would require cars within each size category to improve their mileage by 18 percent over the next five years. But China’s auto market soared 48 percent in 2009, surpassing the American market for the first time, and car sales are rising almost as rapidly again this year. <br />&#8230;<br />An older generation of low-wage migrant workers accepted hot dormitories and factories with barely a fan to keep them cool, one of many reasons Chinese emissions per person are still a third of American emissions per person. Besides higher pay, young Chinese are now demanding their own 100-square-foot studio apartments, with air-conditioning at home and in factories. Indeed, one of the demands by workers who went on strike in May at a Honda transmission factory in Foshan was that the air-conditioning thermostats be set lower. [Rdan&#8230;the mandate is 79 degrees F.]</p></blockquote>

<p>The announcement is being credited with about a 1% higher opening for the stock market and numerous pundits are claiming this will make a significant difference.</p>
<p>But this has happened before and it had little impact. From 2004 to 2007 the yuan appreciated some 20%.  But the net impact was about a 1% rise in the price index for US imports from China and essentially no impact on the US trade deficit with China.<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TB-FSsNIL5I/AAAAAAAABM0/zFmwzDpe1nI/s1600/Clipboard01.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TB-FSsNIL5I/AAAAAAAABM0/zFmwzDpe1nI/s320/Clipboard01.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>So why should anyone expect a different reaction this time?</p>

<blockquote><p>“Go long whatever Chinese consumers buy and go short Chinese capital spending (construction) plays. Consistently, go long tech/short material stocks.”</p></blockquote>
<p>That is the first sentence of a BCA Research report’s executive summary on China equity strategy (link not available). Rather than a global equity strategy, I’d like to put this into an economic growth context via trade…and with Europe.</p>
<p>Go long Eurozone economies selling to China? Is China the panacea for Eurozone growth?  Short answer is no, but we&#8217;ll attend to that later. Even if the euro wasn&#8217;t selling off against <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2010/06/08/254791/chart-du-jour-eurchf/">the</a> <a href="http://ftalphaville.ft.com/blog/2010/06/04/252461/market-snapshot-euro-rout-us-stocks-roiled/">majors,</a> China&#8217;s domestic demand is robust and export income is flowing into the Eurozone &#8211; but to where?</p>
<p>The chart below illustrates the dynamics of annual export growth to China for the top 6 countries of the Eurozone measured by GDP in 2009: Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Netherlands, and Belgium. Presumably, the bulk of China’s export demand would flow to these countries.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vKx6cU2I/AAAAAAAADCU/8RGT-yJV2mw/s1600/growth_exports_china.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vKx6cU2I/AAAAAAAADCU/8RGT-yJV2mw/s320/growth_exports_china.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>Since the Eurozone&#8217;s annual export growth to China bottomed out in May 2009, many of the Eurozone economies (some not shown in chart) have registered, on average, double-digit monthly export growth to China: Belgium 49% Y/Y, Germany 25%, Spain 16%, Greece 19%, Ireland 22%, Netherlands 39%, and Portugal 49%. Only Finland saw its monthly average export income drop over the same period, -10% Y/Y.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p>(A note of clarification: the statistics in the chart are monthly Y/Y growth rates, while the statistics in the paragraph above represent the average monthly Y/Y growth rate spanning the period May 2009 to March 2010. All of this data can be downloaded from <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database">Eurostat</a>, EU27 Trade since 1995 by CN8).</p>
<p>But 75% of the Eurozone’s exports to China flow from just three countries: Germany, 54%, France, 11%, and Italy 10% (average Jan 2009 – Feb 2010 and see table below). This makes sense, given that Germany, France, and Italy are the three largest countries in the Eurozone.</p>
<p>However, compared to the size of their economies, Belgium and Germany are the true beneficiaries of China’s external demand, not Spain, France, nor Italy. And this trade data is truncated before the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&#038;sid=a7EWJiwL2qjY">record decline </a>of the euro.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vLWGG-8I/AAAAAAAADCk/DPq7cKPoILk/s1600/share_table.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vLWGG-8I/AAAAAAAADCk/DPq7cKPoILk/s320/share_table.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The table above relates each country’s share of total Eurozone exports to China to its share of Eurozone GDP. I’d say that Belgium is doing quite well compared to its larger neighbors, +2.5% spread on a 3.8% share base. But Germany&#8217;s out of this world, 26.9% spread on a 26.8% share base. Spain, France, and Italy are faring poorly, as their spreads are wide and negative.</p>
<p>China appears to be the panacea for just a handful of countries, most notably Germany and Belgium. But alas, it’s no panacea for the Eurozone, not even for Germany. Unfortunately, the Eurozone&#8217;s fragile developed colleagues, the US and UK, are.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vLG0jyoI/AAAAAAAADCc/WjnoZKLS8xk/s1600/share_chart.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/TA6vLG0jyoI/AAAAAAAADCc/WjnoZKLS8xk/s320/share_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a><br />The shares illustrated in the chart are calculated for year 2009.</p>
<p>Markets anxiously await China’s every move; but according to the <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/01/weodata/index.aspx">April 2010 IMF World Economic Outlook</a>, China ran the largest current account surplus across the IMF member countries &#8211; $284 bn in 2008 – the 20th largest as a share of GDP. That kind of saving is NOT going to get the global economy back on its feet in full very quickly. China is not the answer for Europe.</p>
<p>The Eurozone,  in particular, is paying close attention to non-Eurozone (16 countries  adopted the euro as their currency) growth alternatives. I leave you with an excerpt from a <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a7df74f6-7002-11df-8698-00144feabdc0.html">nice FT article</a> on Europe’s true woes – fiscal austerity measures &#8211; featuring the research of Wynne Godley and Rob Parenteau:<br />
<blockquote>Many years ago, he [Wynne Godley] also criticised the institutional arrangements of the European Monetary Union. Writing in The Observer in August 1997, he noted that members of the eurozone were not only giving up their currencies but also their fiscal freedom. Within the union, a government could no longer draw cheques on its own central bank but must borrow in the open market. “This may prove excessively expensive or even impossible,” he warned.</p>
<p>He went on to caution that without a common European budget, there was a danger that “the budgetary restraint to which governments are individually committed will impart a disinflationary bias that locks Europe as a whole into a depression that it is powerless to lift”.</p></blockquote>
<p>China is not the  answer: not for Europe; not for the US; and not for the UK.</p>

                                <p>Today I was thinking about tightening cycles in emerging markets; and more specifically, about that in China. Because let’s face it, China matters. China matters to the rest of Asia via competition for export income. China matters to Europe via competition for jobs. China matters to Brazil via domestic production via imports. China matters.</p>
<p>The inflation pressures are building in key emerging economies, especially in the BIICs (Brazil, India, Indonesia, and China) – see <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/02/m1-growth-in-charts-majors-vs-biics.html">this previous post</a> regarding my new acronym, and this article at the <a href="http://curiouscapitalist.blogs.time.com/2010/03/03/should-brics-become-briics/">Curious Capitalist</a> (curiously posted just shortly after my post), which leaves my omitted “R” but relays the intuition behind the second “I”.</p>
<p>Although the inflation is not prevalent in any BIIC except India, really, I wanted to comment about why it will build…quickly.</p>
<p>First round, the construction of consumer prices is heavily weighted toward food and energy costs across the BIICs. Indonesia, India, and China are highly susceptible to food price shocks (either driven by shortages or demand growth). Expect this as a first-round driver of inflation as the global economy recovers further. <a href="http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/newsandcomingevents/t20100311_402626212.htm">It’s already happening</a>.</p>
<p>Second round, the BIICs are growing quickly and nearing, or are already at, potential. Annual industrial production growth has recovered or surpassed its pre-crisis rate in China, Brazil, and India, 19%, 16%, and 17%, respectively. This is expected, given the drop-off in world trade (an illustration can be found from this <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2009/05/world-economic-reports-may-8-15-still.html">May 2009 pos)</a>, but unsustainable as the output gap closes.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S5gIZTJylvI/AAAAAAAAC7E/MAcVWczZQtQ/s1600-h/ip_chart.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S5gIZTJylvI/AAAAAAAAC7E/MAcVWczZQtQ/s320/ip_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a><a name="more"></a>Third round, interest rate differentials. This year, the BIICs&#8217; central banks are expected to raise policy rates. In fact, Brazil, China, and India have already boosted reserve requirements. But with US rates expected to stay low for an “extended period”, international interest rate differentials will change and monetary flows will shift. Capital inflows can lead to inflation if not properly sterilized.</p>
<p>To date, inflows are not properly sterilized, as evidenced by the ongoing accumulation of reserves and rising money supply growth (again, I refer you to my previous post on <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/02/m1-growth-in-charts-majors-vs-biics.html">M1 growth rates</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S5gJYJ9bvYI/AAAAAAAAC7M/XWGPkAvLD3k/s1600-h/forward_chart.PNG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S5gJYJ9bvYI/AAAAAAAAC7M/XWGPkAvLD3k/s320/forward_chart.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart above illustrates the one-year-ahead nominal interest-rate differential between the 2yr forward government rate for each respective BIIC country versus the 2 yr forward US Treasury rate. The forward differentials for China and India are on a steady upward trajectory, while those for Brazil and Indonesia are simply steady. I believe that this appropriately represents the sterilization efforts and monetary policy management on the part of the BIICs’ central banks: more managed in Brazil and Indonesia, not as much in China and India.</p>
<p>So where does this analysis leave us? With a very interesting policy mix in the emerging market space. In fact, in my view this is the riskiest part of the emerging market cycle: the recovery. If policymakers get this wrong, we could see a lot of price action, final goods and assets alike, on the horizon.</p>

<p>There has been a scattering of stories about how China has slowed or stopped buying U.S. Treasuries. This story offers a possible explanation</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-china-invest4-2010mar04,0,4180727,full.story">LA Times: China&#8217;s investments in U.S. up sharply</a><br />
<blockquote>Beijing is using its accumulation of billions of American dollars to step up its investments around the globe. In the last year, Chinese acquisitions in the U.S. have ranged from a relatively obscure theater in Branson, Mo., to stakes in such famous brands as Coca-Cola and Johnson &#038; Johnson.</p>
<p>China&#8217;s huge stockpile of dollars stems in part from Americans&#8217; enormous purchases of relatively inexpensive Chinese manufactured goods and the significantly smaller volume of U.S. exports to the Asian country.</p>
<p>By recycling much of its dollar trove over the years back to the United States with the purchase of U.S. government debt, China has in effect helped Washington finance its deficits.</p>
<p>Now, Beijing is branching out. The country&#8217;s direct investments overseas rose 6.5% in 2009 to $43.3 billion &#8212; despite a global slump in such investments &#8212; and could jump to $60 billion this year, Chinese state media reported last week.</p>
<p>Formal estimates of Chinese investments in the U.S. last year, excluding bond purchases, range from $3.9 billion &#8212; a figure put out by New York research firm Dealogic &#8212; to $6.4 billion, a number that comes from Derek Scissors, a Heritage Foundation research fellow who tracks China&#8217;s global transactions</p></blockquote>
<p> I&#8217;ll let the econoBears explain the significance here, my flip summary would be &#8220;Why rent when you can own&#8221;. It certainly doesn&#8217;t indicate that the Chinese are expecting some terrific crash in the medium term.</p>

                                <p>No, the US Treasury&#8217;s time is not running out. Where&#8217;s <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/">Brad Setser </a>when you need him &#8211; and the media definitely needed him in reference to the <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg548.htm">December TIC report</a>.</p>
<p>Okay, okay, we know: China dropped its share of Treasury holdings in December by $US 34.2 bn. China now holds just 20.9% of the total foreign-owned stock of Treasuries, second only to Japan (21.3%).</p>
<p>But China’s share is closer to its average, while Japan’s share is way off – there may be a reversion here, i.e., Japan will grow its stock of Treasuries relative to China (Please see <a href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/02/foreign-holdings-of-foreign-holdings-of.html">my post yesterday</a>). Except for the period of September 2008 through November 2009, Japan held a much larger share of Treasuries than did China for every month since 2000.</p>
<p>Is <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/article/china-dumping-begins-reserve-managers-notified-any-non-usg-guaranteed-securities-must-be-div">there a sinister plot developing</a>? Is China selling off S-T T bills to retaliate against the Obama administration’s push on the renminbi? Or is China simply reallocating its portfolio toward risk?</p>
<p>Perhaps there is a (partial) retaliation scheme underway, as suggested by the 3-month accumulation of short-term US assets (mostly T bills agencies with a maturity of less than 1 year).</p>
<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3x-nqY6v2I/AAAAAAAAC3E/z4Xndnjsglc/s1600-h/china_st.PNG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3x-nqY6v2I/AAAAAAAAC3E/z4Xndnjsglc/s320/china_st.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>But isn’t it just slightly more plausible that the Chinese are – official + private – selling off zero-yielding (practically) Treasuries in exchange for longer-duration, higher-yielding, and riskier assets.</p>
<p>The first bit of the story is this: one should take care in not reading too much into the TIC report. It’s just one month’s worth of data; but more importantly, the data miss a critical component of the capital account, foreign direct investment.<a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3x-8xO7DZI/AAAAAAAAC3M/RaETJKJSnpU/s1600-h/china_lt.PNG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3x-8xO7DZI/AAAAAAAAC3M/RaETJKJSnpU/s320/china_lt.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart above illustrates China&#8217;s one-year rolling monthly flows of long-term, high quality asset purchases &#8211; Treasuries bonds/notes, agencies, stocks, and corporate bonds. The Chinese are accumulating stocks, primarily through private investors, but through official channels as well (see <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/press/releases/tg548.htm">press release</a>, lines 8 and 13). This suggests an increasing interest in equity, which could signal growing foreign direct investment flows (not shown in TIC).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the entire year’s shift in assets, long-term Treasury purchases, +$US 98.8 bn fully offsets the drop in short-term Treasuries, -$US 98.8. This suggests diversification.</p>
<p>Finally, everybody’s doing it, not just China &#8211; diversifying away from T bills, that is!</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3x_1Z2Rm8I/AAAAAAAAC3U/tVtngEuC2Qk/s1600-h/total_st.PNG"><img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_Et4TQ-a0gGU/S3x_1Z2Rm8I/AAAAAAAAC3U/tVtngEuC2Qk/s320/total_st.PNG" alt="" border="0"></a>The chart above illustrates the 3-month rolling sum of all foreign net flows of ST US assets (mostly T bills). If you invest $US 1 million dollars today in a bill expiring in August 2010, you make about 900 bucks. Man, doesn’t that sound like a wonderful investment?</p>
<p>So the next question is: why do the Chinese care about return on their F/X holdings? Because they have a peg! <a href="http://www.brookings.edu/articles/2009/0721_chinas_reserve_prasad.aspx">Here is a great article</a> for all of you who wanted to know about the costs of maintaining a peg. Accumulating FX reserves is a costly business, and T bills are unlikely to finance the type of sterilization that is needed by the PBoC.</p>

                                <p>Marshall Auerback responds to Rebecca&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://www.newsneconomics.com/2010/02/response-to-i-have-to-side-with-china.html">&#8220;I have to side with China on this one&#8221;</a>.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another factor as well. There&#8217;s been an enormous increase in money and credit in the past year. In fact, it seems to<a href="javascript:void(0)" target=""></a> be as great as 5 years&#8217; growth in credit in the previous Chinese bubble. What happens is that the increase in money and credit is so great and so abrupt that you tend to get a high inflation quite quickly even if there are under utilised resources? Add to this the fact that you&#8217;ve got massive fiscal stimulus occurring today in China.</p>
<p>You have the makings of a very messy situation: if China seeks to sustain demand via fiscal policy, then you could get a big inflation problem, which could severely erode the tradeables sector. And you have all of these Chinese students all steeped in Chicago School monetary theory, coming home and taking over. So they might do a Paul Volcker to stop inflation.</p>
<p>But, what if the they don&#8217;t? Inflation can take off and thereby begin to ERODE the competitiveness of Chinese exports. This might be the real reason why China is so reticent to revalue its currency. The Americans might go crazy if the Chinese devalue, but if the inflation is high enough, they might have to do it, as it will severely erode their terms of trade and cause their tradeables sector to collapse.</p>
<p>Or you get the hard-line monetarists triumphing by fighting inflation and you get riots as unemployment increases.</p>
<p>It could get very ugly.</p>
<p>This could be happening now in China. Everybody says no. The consensus is that inflation is a couple per cent and it is all pork prices because there was a lousy corn harvest.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />However, economists such as those at Lombard Street in the UK, Jim Walker, Simon Hunt and the like try to figure out the changes quarter to quarter in Chinese nominal GDP which is reported only year on year. And they come up with giant double digit growth rates for the second half of last year.</p>
<p>Now this is complicated by the fact that the Chinese have revised up their GDP numbers and they throw the revisions all into the final quarter of the year. But when these guys try to adjust for that statistical screw up they still come up with giant nominal GDP increases. Lombard Street thinks it was twenty five per cent or so in the second half of last year. They think it was twenty per cent real and five per cent inflation.</p>
<p>Economies never grow at a twenty per cent real rate. And Simon Hunt says if you look at proxies like power output and rail traffic you don&#8217;t get those kinds of numbers for real growth, which suggests that inflation must be higher than four or five per cent. Indeed, it could already be double digit. It is hard to say. But if it is double digit then the resultant inflation will cause a real revaluation of the trade weighted exchange rate.</p>
<p>And more so if the dollar rallies. That could well crush the volume of exports and the profitability of the industrial tradeables sector. Exports are the only area where China makes any kind of money because they can sell these products for about 10 times what they obtain for a comparable product in the domestic economy (where profits are virtually nil). The export sector is a big contributor to overall super excessive fixed investment in China. FDI will go to zero net.</p>
<p>There will be strong forces for a reduction in fixed investment in this large sector. Hence, there is a good chance that even without monetary tightening by the Chinese authorities, the overall fixed investment boom in China will turn down.</p>
<p>Nobody is thinking about this but it is a real possibility. And with fixed investment now at fifty per cent of gdp (which is unprecedented in any economy) and exports at more than thirty, we&#8217;re looking at ratios that have never been reached before on a combined basis turning these two down could create a severe recession in China. China has gone too far this time. I think they are in a box that they and others don&#8217;t recognize. The &#8220;Black Swan&#8221; event this year could well be a devaluation of the RMB.</p>

                                <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/21/091221fa_fact_osnos"> The New Yorker</a> gives us a small look into policy in china other than the currency peg:<br />
<blockquote>The Problem Statement</p>
<p>U.S. manufacturing’s competitive status is increasingly challenged by other economies. Established industrialized nations such as Japan, Germany, Korea and Taiwan are developing state-of-the-art technologies, which range across all areas of manufacturing from electronics to discrete parts. Products based on technologies that originated in the U.S. economy, such as semiconductors and robotics, are increasingly both developed and produced elsewhere. </p>
<p>Emerging economies, such as China, are acquiring manufacturing capability through modest R&#038;D intensities, tax and other incentives for foreign direct investment, and intellectual property theft. This second group then competes through low-cost labor and the use of exchange rate manipulation along with tariff and non-tariff barriers.</p>
<p>However, emerging technology-based economies have the long-term goal of attaining world-class status as innovators, which means they are not content to operate at the low-technology, labor-intensive portion of manufacturing. China already is producing 30,000 patents annually and its patent application rate trails only the United States and Japan.1 Finally, event the huge U.S. lead in biopharmaceuticals is now under attack, as an increasing number of economies invest in supporting science and technology infrastructures and provide financial incentives for foreign direct investment in this rapidly expanding technology.</p>
<p>The combined long-term impact on the U.S. economy of investments by both established and newly industrialized economies has been the offshoring of substantial portions of U.S. manufacturing supply chains—first the labor-intensive industries but now the high-tech ones, as well.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>In the years that followed, the government pumped billions of dollars into labs and universities and enterprises, on projects ranging from cloning to underwater robots. Then, in 2001, Chinese officials abruptly expanded one program in particular: energy technology. The reasons were clear. Once the largest oil exporter in East Asia, China was now adding more than two thousand cars a day and importing millions of barrels; its energy security hinged on a flotilla of tankers stretched across distant seas. Meanwhile, China was getting nearly eighty per cent of its electricity from coal, which was rendering the air in much of the country unbreathable and hastening climate changes that could undermine China’s future stability. Rising sea levels were on pace to create more refugees in China than in any other country, even Bangladesh. </p>
<p>In 2006, Chinese leaders redoubled their commitment to new energy technology; they boosted funding for research and set targets for installing wind turbines, solar panels, hydroelectric dams, and other renewable sources of energy that were higher than goals in the United States. China doubled its wind-power capacity that year, then doubled it again the next year, and the year after. The country had virtually no solar industry in 2003; five years later, it was manufacturing more solar cells than any other country, winning customers from foreign companies that had invented the technology in the first place. As President Hu Jintao, a political heir of Deng Xiaoping, put it in October of this year, China must “seize preëmptive opportunities in the new round of the global energy revolution.”</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>A China born again green can be hard to imagine, especially for people who live here. After four years in Beijing, I’ve learned how to gauge the pollution before I open the curtains; by dawn on the smoggiest days, the lungs ache. </p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>David Sandalow, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Energy for Policy and International Affairs, has been to China five times in five months. He told me, “China’s investment in clean energy is extraordinary.” For America, he added, the implication is clear: “Unless the U.S. makes investments, we are not competitive in the clean-tech sector in the years and decades to come.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>China is already buying and installing the world’s most efficient transmission lines—“an area where China has actually moved ahead of the U.S.,” according to Deborah Seligsohn, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. In the next decade, China plans to install wind-power equipment capable of generating nearly five times the power of the Three Gorges Dam, the world’s largest producer.</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The prospect of a future powered by the sun and the wind is so appealing that it obscures a less charming fact: coal is going nowhere soon. Even the most optimistic forecasts agree that China and the United States, for the foreseeable future, will remain ravenous consumers. (China burns more coal than America, Europe, and Japan combined.) As Julio Friedmann, an energy expert at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, near San Francisco, told me, “The decisions that China and the U.S. make in the next five years in the coal sector will determine the future of this century.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>When Albert Lin, an American energy entrepreneur on the board of Future Fuels, a Texas-based power-plant developer, set out to find a gasifier for a pioneering new plant that is designed to spew less greenhouse gas, he figured that he would buy one from G.E. or Shell. Then his engineers tested the Xi’an version. It was “the absolute best we’ve seen,” Lin told me. (Lin said that the “secret sauce” in the Chinese design is a clever bit of engineering that recycles the heat created by the gasifier to convert yet more coal into gas.) His company licensed the Chinese design, marking one of the first instances of Chinese coal technology’s coming to America. “Fifteen or twenty years ago, anyone you asked would have said that Western technologies in coal gasification were superior to anything in China,” Lin said. “Now, I think, that claim is not true.”</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Obama Administration is busy repairing the energy legacy of its predecessor. The stimulus package passed in February put more than thirty-eight billion dollars into the Department of Energy for renewable-energy projects—including four hundred million for ARPA-E, the agency that Bush opposed. (It also allocated a billion dollars toward reviving FutureGen, though a final decision is pending.)</p></blockquote>
