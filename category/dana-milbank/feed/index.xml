				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
<div dir="ltr">In subtle ways, Ryan’s budget acknowledges the results of November’s election. He isn’t seeking to do away with tax increases that have already been approved, and he accepts that tax revenue will be 19.1 percent of the economy in a decade, up from the 18.7 percent he assumed last year.</div>
<div dir="ltr">But otherwise, he continues to peddle the same ideas: the partial privatization of Medicare; a 10 percent reduction in the federal workforce; and cuts to Medicaid, food stamps, education, job training and farm programs.</div>
<div dir="ltr">Public Radio International’s Todd Zwillich pointed out that Republicans lost the presidency, House seats and the combined popular vote in House races. “People outside this process might wonder if elections have consequences,” Zwillich said.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“Look, whether the country intended it or not, we have divided government,” Ryan replied, suggesting that Republicans somehow won the debate while losing the election. “Are a lot of these solutions very popular, and did we win these arguments in the campaign?” Ryan asked himself. “Some of us think so.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/03/paul-ryan-is-joe-mccarthy-of-our-era.html">Paul Ryan’s magical budget</a>, Dana Milbank, Washington Post</div>
<p>And those very same some of us think upside-down is rightside-up and aliens from Mars ate their calculator and their voter tabulations.  They need antipsychotic medication.  </p>
<div dir="ltr">He proposes abolishing Obamacare — a futile gesture — but would pocket for other purposes $1 trillion in tax increases that came with the program. &#8230;</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">CNN’s Dana Bash asked whether Ryan was being “disingenuous” by including new taxes that he opposed.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“We’re not going to refight the past,” he explained.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">If Ryan is “not going to fight the past,” Fox News’s Chad Pergram asked, why is he still trying to repeal Obamacare?</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“This to us is something that we’re not going to give up on,” Ryan answered, “because we’re not going to give up on destroying the health-care system for the American people.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Even a skilled illusionist can have the occasional Freudian slip.</div>

<p>Game’s over.  The mainstream media has had enough. They’re finally calling this spade a spade. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_N._Welch">Joe Welch</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/03/paul-ryan-is-joe-mccarthy-of-our-era.html">would be proud</a>. </p>
<p>At long last, Congressman, the people who matter see that you have left no sense of decency. Nor a semblance of mental health. Like Joe McCarthy.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
<div dir="ltr">The State of the Union ritual is by now familiar to most Americans. President Obama leads the Democratic side of the chamber to a series of standing ovations for proposals that everybody knows won’t become law. Republicans show their seriousness of purpose by smirking or making stony faces — and by inviting as guests to the speech people such as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/reliable-source/post/ted-nugent-attending-state-of-the-union-address/2013/02/11/2b868238-749f-11e2-95e4-6148e45d7adb_blog.html">rocker Ted Nugent</a>, who has called the president a “piece of [excrement]” who should “suck on my machine gun.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But this spectacle, unlike [Mardi Gras], is not all harmless fun. Obama made clear that he is not entertaining serious spending cuts or major entitlement reforms. Republicans, in their responses, repeated that they are not budging on taxes. The hard choices will have to wait for another day.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The standoff gives new meaning to Fat Tuesday: The nation’s finances are a mess, but — what the heck? — let’s have another round. No wonder a new Washington Post poll found that <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2013/02/12/obama-faces-deeply-divided-nation-in-state-of-the-union-address/">56 percent of Americans</a> have a dim view of the country’s political system.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-state-of-the-union-and-mardi-gras--what-a-coincidence/2013/02/12/105119ee-7560-11e2-aa12-e6cf1d31106b_story.html?hpid=z2">Let the bleak times roll</a>, Dana Milbank, Washington Post, today</div>
<p>Yup.  Fifty-six percent of Americans want another deep recession.  Now!  Our nation’s finances are a mess.  And they want to see them become messier!  And they want a few million hungry or homeless elderly. Not necessarily now.  But soon.</p>
<p>The luxury of being a Centrist, at least one of this particular and common variety, is that you can spout generic truisms without ever actually tying them to specifics.  Much less to basic economics principles. Milbank’s column is so replete with unsupported and in fact completely unexplained inferences&#8211;declaratory clauses and sentences each made in its own little vacuum but offered as though dependent upon one another&#8211;that Milbank’s heard somewhere, that I wondered as I read this thing whether he’d brought his MacBook Air to a <a href="http://www.uline.com/Grp_316/Plastic-Retail-Food-Bags?pricode=WL25&#038;gclid=CPSNs8rBs7UCFZE-MgodmS8Axw">Uline</a> plant to watch the speech last night. I mean, how else to explain this?:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Early in his address, Obama pronounced himself “more than halfway towards the goal of $4 trillion in deficit reduction that economists say we need to stabilize our finances.” He blithely proclaimed that the rest of the job could be done by making “modest reforms” to Medicare and “getting rid of tax loopholes and deductions for the well-off.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">He didn’t mention that this would leave the country with a historically high debt level — and would be but a temporary fix before health-care costs explode in a decade. Departing from his prepared text, Obama challenged the idea that “deficit reduction is a big emergency, justifying making cuts in Social Security.” </div>
<p>Oh, horrors. After all, deficit reduction is a big emergency. And a historically high debt level&#8211;irrespective of the specifics, such as how high that debt level is relative to GDP&#8211;will crash the economy.  Just like the historically high debt levels did at the end of World War II. </p>
<p>“Washington’s version of Mardi Gras had begun early in the day, at the Capitol South Metro station, where members of a nonpartisan balanced-budget group, Bankrupting America, offered beads to passersby willing to ‘show us your cuts,’” Milbank writes. “By that standard, few necklaces would be distributed. Democrats and Republicans alike would sooner bare their private parts than come clean about what government programs they would cut.”  True enough.</p>
<p>But then, this:</p>
<div dir="ltr">Even [Paul] Ryan, who is drafting a budget that could slash domestic discretionary spending by 40 percent over a decade, doesn’t like to be specific. </div>
<p>Even Paul Ryan doesn’t like to be specific about cuts that would slash domestic spending by 40 percent over decade?  Even Paul Ryan?  You don’t say!</p>
<p>And then, of course:</p>
<div dir="ltr">And House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi says, “<a href="http://foxnewsinsider.com/2013/02/10/nancy-pelosi-says-the-spending-problem-is-a-false-argument/">It is almost a false argument to say we have a spending problem</a>.”</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Pelosi’s formulation is just as reckless as the Republicans’ mantra: “We don’t have a revenue problem; we have a spending problem.”</div>
<p>Of course. Which is why, pre-Bush-tax-cuts, and pre-Bush-unfunded-wars, we didn’t have a spending problem. Now we do, so let’s cut Social Security!  Canada, Germany, Australia and Holland must also have spending problems.  After all, they have extensive social safety-net programs, and high standards of living.</p>
<p>Milbank ends by saying, “In reality, we eventually need both spending cuts and tax increases — and lots of them. But sacrifice will have to wait. In Washington, they’re still partying like there’s no tomorrow.”</p>
<p>No, actually, the Democrats are partying like there is a tomorrow.  There&#8217;s real, if unwitting, irony in the headline writer&#8217;s choice of a heading for Milbank&#8217;s column.  Although&#8211;who knows?&#8211;maybe the headline writer actually is familiar with Keynesian economics. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m a political junkie, born and bred.  And so the number of political opinion pieces I’ve read in my life, dating back to my teenage years (me being a child of my parents, they of the ardent liberal Democrat variety&#8211; “Oh, no, Bevy!  You have to return that purse.  That company is anti-union!”  “Okayyy, Mom.”)&#8211;run probably into the thousands.  (Yikes.)  </p>
<p>And I’ve certainly read, ah-hem, a few pieces by established, mainstream columnists in respected newspapers and magazines that have made my eyes roll or made me shake my head in dismay because of some obvious flaw in logic or some clearly false representation of fact upon which the writer’s premise lies.  </p>
<p>But I don’t think I’ve ever before read such a mystifyingly wacky, whiplash-inducing, incomprehensibly-false-fact-based commentary as <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/brooks-the-collective-turn.html?_r=0">the one I just read</a>, by David Brooks, in today&#8217;s New York Times.  The premise: That Obama’s argument for returning the federal government’s domestic-policy emphasis to trying to increase economic and social mobility, improving public infrastructure, encouraging individual creativity, inventiveness and risk-taking, and trying to help limit climate change, Obama was arguing for … you guessed it! (at least if you read Brooks’s columns even occasionally, as I do) … European-style central-government control (commands from “headquarters”; seriously) over the private sector and the private sector’s creativeness and innovativeness.  </p>
<p>No, sir!  Wouldn’t want any of that socialist German-style engineering expertise to make its way across the Atlantic. Especially since all those engineers at, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siemens">Siemens</a> got their engineering degrees at &#8212; and this is really dangerous&#8211;places like the University of Heidelberg!  Which is, OMG, a public university!  Supported by German taxes.  And financially accessible by some students whose families are not upscale!</p>
<p>Yup.  And that engineering and computer science school at the University of Illinois, regularly rated among the top such programs in the country, can’t possibly have produced someone who, say, while attending the school, developed the World Wide Web by developing the first Internet browser, called Mosaic, which became Netscape.  Uh-uh.  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Andreessen">Marc Andreessen</a> only thinks his college memories of life in Champaign, Ill. But they’re really of life in Palo Alto.  Or maybe Cambridge, Mass.  And how did that Wisconsin native even manage to invent anything at all, given the “hammock” (Paul Ryan’s term, not Brooks’s) he found himself in when he (probably) took out a low-interest, no-repayments-required-until-five-years-after-graduation loan to pay that out-of-state tuition back in the late 1980s, and early 1990s, under a federal Great Society program? </p>
<p>The whiplash-inducing stuff in Brooks’s column appears at two points. The first one comes about midway through the column, when Brooks switches from praising the Obama speech as a strong argument for collective government policies to, say, assist in economic and social mobility.  The second one comes late in the column, after paragraphs in which he says such things as that we have a much more dynamic and innovative private sector than does Europe because colleges and universities in the Unites States are private rather than public and Europe’s are public rather than private (I’m not joking or exaggerating; he says this), and that the programs Obama supports, such as student loan programs and financial support for schools and medical and scientific research and the like, are attempts by political progressives to undermine private enterprise and control the private sector from Washington.  He then concedes, apparently unwittingly&#8211;he seems unaware, at least, of the irony&#8211;that public programs and financial regulations can (and do!) assist creativity and innovation.</p>
<p>You really have to read the whole column to get the full flavor.  Just put on a neck brace first.</p>
<p>And while you’re reading it, remind yourself that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Graham_Bell">Alexander Graham Bel</a>l, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_">Henry Ford</a> did not attend a private college.  Nor did <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enrico_Fermi">Enrico Fermi </a>or some of the other great physicists who emigrated to this country in the late 1930s after receiving their education at public universities&#8211;in Europe!  </p>
<p>And that David Brooks did attend a private university: the University of Chicago.  And that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Brooks_(journalist)">his Philadelphia Main Line parents </a>probably paid his tuition and room and board, free and clear.</p>
<p>Enough said. I think.  Unless of course he’s invented something that I don’t know of.  And that’s useful. </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*PS: Indulge me in my obsession with idiocy from big-name, mainstream political pundits, writing in (or on) prestigious, widely read political-commentary forums.  Neither David Brooks <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">nor Dana Milba</a><a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">nk</a> is, after all, all that important, I recognize.  But Brooks, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/he-asked-not-what-his-country-can-do.html">if not Milbank</a>, flatly crossed the line into misrepresentation of fact in a way that is really beyond the pale. And no one but me probably even noticed.  </p>
<p>Frustrating. </p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />ANOTHER PS: As I said in response to a comment in the Comments thread, Brooks’s longtime shtick is anti-European&#8211;as in, Europe’s standard of living is lower than ours and that’s because their socialist policies deter creativity and innovation and therefore “dynamism.” He’s apparently run out of plausible-sounding arguments to support his belief, so he just blathers the claim incoherently, as needed.</p>

<div dir="ltr">There was less wow in the address that preceded [singer Kelly] Clarkson. Obama teased the crowd with a theme of unity: “Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation and one people.” But his “we the people” theme turned out to be more of a campaign retread. “We the people understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,” he said. “We reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.”</div>
<div dir="ltr">And we the people accept that we live in an era of diminished oratory.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/obama-brings-more-optimism-partisanship-and-populism-to-second-inaugural-speech/2013/01/21/ad3a04ec-4d0f-11e2-950a-7863a013264b_story.html?hpid=z3">Dana Milbank</a>, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">professional Centrist</a>, Washington Post</div>
<p>Yes, and we the people also accept that some high-profile, highly-paid, political pundits make careers out of confusing vapidity with statesmanship.  And oratory with substance. </p>
<p>And rote, <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-president-congeniality-talks-tough/2013/01/14/6f5b50a0-5e9d-11e2-90a0-73c8343c6d61_print.html">formulaic</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/apparently-national-reviews-editors.html">nonsense</a> with analysis. </p>
<p>Ask not what your political pundit can do for your understanding of substantive policy issues and politics&#8211;ask what you can do for your political pundit’s logic compass.  Which I think is to stop reading his column. </p>

<div dir="ltr">Today, in another step forward, the National Review <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/337681/averting-default-achieving-restraint-editors?pg=1#">calls on Republicans to take the threat of default off the table</a>:</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Republicans should recognize that the prospect of default is the Democrats’ chief weapon in their campaign of avoidance. That prospect is not a source of Republican leverage in the debt-ceiling fight; it is the primary source of the Democrats’ leverage. It is a way to distract the press and the public from the reality of our fiscal crisis.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The Democrats’ strategy offers Republicans an opportunity. Since the Democrats insist that the prospect of default is the reason they will not negotiate about spending restraint, Republicans should begin the debt-ceiling fight by permanently eliminating that prospect, turning the debt-ceiling debate into an argument about future spending rather than past borrowing.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The House should pass a bill to redefine the debt limit so that it constrains primary spending but not debt service. Under this reform, a Treasury that had hit the statutory borrowing limit could continue to borrow what it needed exclusively for paying interest on the national debt and to roll over existing debt obligations, but it could not borrow for any other government spending until the limit had been increased. This would take default entirely off the table.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The policy suggestion here is a bit puzzling: As one Dem joked to me, is the idea that the GOP will only continue to threaten to prevent Congress from paying out things like Social Security and veterans’ benefits, but not interest payments? That aside, the core point here is that National Review is admitting that the threat of default gives the leverage not to Republicans, but to Democrats.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">&#8212; <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2013/01/15/the-morning-plum-conservatives-surrendering-in-debt-ceiling-fight/">The Morning Plum: Conservatives surrendering in debt ceiling fight?</a>, Greg Sargent, Washington Post, this morning</div>
<p>Ah. It’s official: The National Review’s editors do not depend on Social Security and Medicare to survive or keep them from bankruptcy.  Nor do they have an elderly parent in a nursing home who, since exhausting his or her financial reserves, remain cared for there by dint of Medicaid. Which is nice for them.</p>
<p>And most of them live in the Northeast, not in Arizona, California, New Mexico, or Texas, so, much as they hate illegal immigration from Mexico, it doesn’t really impact their lives.  Their homes, unlike the Arizona ranchers who elect the state legislators who enact harsh anti-illegal-immigrant laws, their own property, including their winter homes, are probably secured by private guards.</p>
<p>But they probably do fly.  Maybe in their employer’s or their friends’ corporate jets rather than in commercial airliners.  But fly, nonetheless.  They also probably eat produce, poultry, meat and dairy products inspected by&#8211;OMG&#8211;a federal agency; specifically, the Department of Agriculture.  </p>
<p>So it didn’t occur to them that, by publishing that editorial in which they acknowledge that the Republicans are losing the PR fight on the debt ceiling, and in which they advised the Republicans nonetheless to issue a revised ransom note removing only bond interest payments and already-incurred contractual debts as hostages and leaving the rest with guns to their heads&#8211;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-president-congeniality-talks-tough/2013/01/14/6f5b50a0-5e9d-11e2-90a0-73c8343c6d61_print.html">sorry, Dana Milbank</a>, but that analogy is appropriate even after Sandy Hook, and is utterly irrelevant to Sandy Hook (what a weird claim by Milbank in <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/what-dana-milbanks-stunningly-awful.html">a thoroughly off-kilter op-ed</a>)&#8211;they’re effectively urging the Repubs to commit political suicide.</p>
<p>I say, go for it, Repubs!  Go for it. </p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Okay.  There’s no way to do justice to Washington Post centerist columnist Dana Milbank’s column today about Obama’s “presser” yesterday by just summarizing it or quoting a sentence or short paragraph from it.  And justice for that column, titled “<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-president-congeniality-talks-tough/2013/01/14/6f5b50a0-5e9d-11e2-90a0-73c8343c6d61_print.html">President Congeniality talks tough</a>,” is what I want.  So here are the first six (blessedly short) paragraphs of it:
<div dir="ltr">“I’m a pretty friendly guy,” President Obama said near the end of his White House news conference Monday afternoon.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">The claim might have been a touch more plausible if he hadn’t spent the bulk of the previous hour demonstrating just how adversarial he could be. Indeed, there was no precipitating event that led him to schedule the last-minute session in the East Room — lending credibility to the theory that he summoned reporters so he could bait Republicans.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">“If congressional Republicans refuse to pay America’s bills on time, Social Security checks and veterans benefits will be delayed,” the friendly president said, explaining his refusal to negotiate over increasing the debt limit.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Calling the opposition’s stance “absurd,” Obama advised Republicans that they “have two choices here: They can act responsibly and pay America’s bills, or they can act irresponsibly and put America through another economic crisis. But they will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy. . . . And they better choose quickly, because time is running short.”</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">And that was just the opening statement. The hectoring continued through the Q&#038;A. Exactly one month after the massacre at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., Obama said of debt-reduction talks: “What I will not do is to have that negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people.”</p>
</div>
<div dir="ltr">The Republicans’ view, President Congeniality added, “was rejected by the American people when it was debated during the presidential campaign. . . . But if the House Republicans disagree with that and they want to shut down the government to see if they can get their way on it, that’s their prerogative.”</div>
<p>I agree completely.  The president should never summon White House reporters to the White House press room in order to hold a press conference.  Or at least not to bait Republicans.</p>
<p>And, I guess, not even to respond to Republican daily baiting of him by falsely telling the public that a quirk in the law, requiring Congress to authorize the Treasury to pay the government’s already-incurred bills and bond interest, and pay such things as salaries to military personnel, air traffic controllers, Agriculture Department food inspectors, and Homeland Security airport marshals&#8211;not to mention not-yet-but-about-to-be owed Social Security payments, Medicaid payments to nursing homes, and Medicare payments to physicians and hospitals&#8211;is instead a request by the president and the Democrats in Congress to increase spending appropriations.  </p>
<p>No, sir.  Much better to allow the Republicans to prey on the public’s misunderstanding of the phrase “raise the debt ceiling.”   </p>
<p>Pass the ransom note, Republicans. Just do it through the mainstream media, as you have been doing.  They’ll happily repeat your message, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/will-republicans-debt-ceiling-is-about.html">complete with disinformation</a>, without adding their own: a brief explanation of what the debt ceiling actually is.  Apparently, congressional reporters, unlike the White House press corp, don’t mind being summoned as bait.  Nor do the Sunday talk-show folk.  </p>
<p>Worms, all. </p>
<p>Milbank does allow that:</p>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Arguably, Obama’s no-more-Mr.-Nice-Guy approach is good politics. His first-term experience made clear that he gained nothing from Republicans when he took a passive approach. When it comes to getting things done in Washington, there’s no substitute for forceful presidential leadership. Teddy Roosevelt, whose oil-on-canvas likeness gazed at Obama from an East Room wall, probably would have approved.</div>
<p>Actually, not even just arguably, Milbank conflates statements of fact&#8211;in this instance, fact about what the debt ceiling is&#8211;with politics.  Certainly, correcting the opposition’s campaign of disinformation, and educating the public about a critical but technical statute that almost no one other than Washington pols, fiscal-policy wonks, and journalists who cover these people and subjects are familiar with, is damn good politics.  It is, in fact, absolutely necessary politics.  It’s dereliction-of-duty-for-failure-to-do-so politics.  </p>
<p>But statements of fact, and statements of policy based on the statements of fact, are not themselves mere politics.  They’re statements of fact and statements of policy based on those facts. </p>
<p>What’s most disturbing about this column is not that one high-profile political columnist confuses these things, but that he says that the entire White House press corp in attendance at the press conference yesterday does.  </p>
<p>So I suggest that they get out more.  Milbank, for example, might consider stepping out of Washington and into, maybe, Baltimore.  Not a long drive, really.  There, he could stop in at a coffee shop or mall and maybe ask people whether they had heard or read of Obama’s comments yesterday and, if so, whether they understood more now about the what debt ceiling statute is than they did a day before.</p>
<p>Then he can report his findings to the rest of the White House press corp.  And offer a different theory about the reason Obama summoned them to the press room yesterday.</p>
<p>Or he could <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/rep-greg-walden-r-or-explains-debt.html">just</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/obama-we-are-not-deadbeat-nation-but.html">start</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/see-harold-meyersons-washington-post.html">reading</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/call-this-spade-spade-deadbeat-threat.html">Angry</a> <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2013/01/the-continued-necessity-of-explaining.html">Bear</a>.  </p>
<p>Seriously, I hope Paul Krugman and other “names” will expose Milbank’s argument for what it is. Obama has that tendency to cower whenever a media meme takes hold on fiscal-policy issues. Milbank and the White House press corp don’t read Angry Bear, but they might read Krugman’s blog. 
<div>  Nah; probably not.  It’s not like Krugman’s a centerist, or anything.  Still, it’s worth a shot, especially since what matters most is that Obama or someone close to him might.<br /> <i>This</i> Bear is <i>really</i> ANGRY today.</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<p>UPDATED:  Well, I woke up this morning to a few congratulatory emails, including from some Bears, telling me that Paul Krugman linked to my post yesterday <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/">in a blog post of his</a>.  Awesome!  (Thanks, Prof. Krugman.  And thanks to everyone for the congrats.)  </p>
<p>But I also want to republish here as an update an exchange between Bear JazzB. and me in the comments to the post:</p>
<div dir="ltr">JazzBumpa:   I always thought Milbank was more or less OK.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">But this is really stupid.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Me:  Milbank was terrific back when he was the Post’s WH correspondent during the first G.W. Bush term, JazzB. But he rarely writes anything in his column that I think is really insightful or informative, and sometimes he writes a column that’s just baffling. Like yesterday’s.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">What really dismays me is that he and some of the other “name” pundits flat-out missed the purpose of Obama’s Monday press conference. Obama was explaining what the debt ceiling law actually is&#8211;and what it is not. An explanation that was (and is) necessity because it’s a law that sounds like it means something that it does not, and that means something that it does not sound like it means&#8211;a fact that the Repubs have abused nearly every time one of them says anything publicly about it.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Dave Weigel <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2013/01/barack_obama_s_last_first_term_press_conference_the_president_spoke_of_republicans.html">wrote</a> a [Politics article]* on Slate on Monday after the press conference that started out sounding like he missed the point&#8211;and then, wham!  He hit the nail on the head, pointing out that back in Sept. Obama said he planned to speak much more, directly, to the public and explain policy issues.  Weigel said that the Repubs mocked that then, but learned on Monday what he meant.  </div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">And it does seem that the Repubs did learn a lot on Monday, because since then, several have publicly acknowledged that the debt ceiling game is over.  Yet Milbank and a few other pundits didn’t catch on.</div>
<p>And as long as I’m updating here, I’ll indulge myself and republish another exchange I had in the Comments to the post&#8211;this one with FastCommerce:</p>
<div dir="ltr">FastCommerce:  Worms. You an idiot.</div>
<p>
<div dir="ltr">Me:  Oh, dear. FastCommerce, it looks like you took the BAIT.</div>
<p>So sorry, folks.  But I couldn’t resist.</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*In my original comment, I said Weigel wrote a blog post.  Actually, what he wrote was a full-length article, not a comment or short piece on his Slate blog.  (Those of us who are longtime Slate addicts know there’s a difference.)</div>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
<div>Not surprisingly, the pundits have concluded that, while the debate last night will stop the bleeding for the Dem ticket—stop the momentum for Romney/Ryan—it won’t make a difference beyond that. People don’t vote for the vice presidential candidate; they vote for, or against, a presidential candidate.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And anyway, Biden smiled too much!  And Ryan was serious and wonkish! 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The problem with that analysis is that Biden was wonkish, too.  And in being wonkish—and in smiling and even laughing at Ryan’s canned claims repeating Romney’s from last week—Biden began the process of pointing the public to the fact that Romney’s biggest hits from last week are based on nonsense.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It is, in other words, the <i>substance</i> of Biden’s performance, rather than the <i>performance</i>stuff that the pundits fixate on, that actually will matter.  In my opinion, one of the most effective moments was Biden’s giving the lie to an important part of the supposed Reagan/Tip O’Neill analogy: that, heading into the negotiations with O’Neill, Reagan didn’t give specifics about what he wanted.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Another important moment—moments, actually; he did it two or three times—was Biden’s challenge to the claim that six studies showed that the Romney/Ryan tax math would work.  Biden’s emphatically shaking his head and, yes, smiling and then laughing—he wasn’t able to inject comments, and Raddatz (who impressed me less than she did everyone else) played Lehrer; she asked no questions at all about this—his facial reactions got the message across.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I have two complaints, though.  One is that Biden didn’t point out that the Five Point Plan is actually not a plan at all but instead just a statement of generic goals—as is the claim that it will create 12 million jobs, like magic.  Presumably, Obama will do that at the debate next week, and do so clearly and repeatedly.   
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The other is that Biden didn’t say, much less emphasize, that it mattered for the <i>policy </i>outcome that Reagan was dealing with a Democratic House as well as a Democratic Senate.*  After the election, the House will continue to be controlled by the Tea Party—and, by Romney’s and Ryan’s own account, they’ll let Congress play a big role in drafting legislation.  That is, the House will support the Romney-Ryan administration in trying to force enactment of … the Ryan budget.  Presumably, Obama will do this, too, at the debate next week, and do so clearly and repeatedly.   
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But Biden succeeded, I’m pretty sure, in raising questions in people’s minds about the forthrightness of Romney’s representations last week (reiterated by Ryan last night) , and the truthfulness of his claims.  Obama might actually pick up the ball from Biden and run with it.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Could happen!
</p>
<p>&#8212;-</p>
<div>UPDATE: Dana Milbank of the Washington Post <i><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/dana-milbank-in-vice-presidential-debate-biden-rattles-ryan/2012/10/12/427cd0c0-1430-11e2-be82-c3411b7680a9_story.html?hpid=z3">gets it</a></i>! It’s a start.  Hopefully only <i>just </i>a start. 
</p>
</div>
<div>But &#8230; woo-hooo!</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*CORRECTION: The sentence was corrected for the sake of clarity to include the words &#8220;for the <i>policy </i>outcome&#8221;.</div>
