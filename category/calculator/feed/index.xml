				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/01/us-usa-asia-arms-sales-idUSBRE90005D20130101?article" target="_blank">Reuters</a> comes this piece on arms spending:</p>
<blockquote><p>Demand for big-ticket U.S. weapons is expected to stay strong for at least the next few years, the trade group said in a 2012 year-end review and forecast released in December.<br />Fears resulting from China&#8217;s growing military spending (bolding mine&#8230;the US has about <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/27/us-arms-sales-2011_n_1833602.html#slide=504167US...4.8%25">4.8% spending to GDP ratio</a>) should lead to enough U.S. sales in South and East Asia to more than offset a slowdown in European arms-buying, according to the forecast.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Dan here:) The graph offers a year to year estimate of China&#8217;s spending to GDP ratio.  What am I Â missing?</p>

<p><a name="more"></a><br />The article continues&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>The trade group, whose members include Pentagon suppliers Lockheed Martin Corp, Boeing Co and Northrop Grumman Corp, did not put numbers to its 2013 forecast. Nor did the Pentagon&#8217;s Defense Security Cooperation Agency, which has overseen a boom in worldwide deals under President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>The security agency, in response to a Reuters request, said sales agreements with countries in the U.S. Pacific Command&#8217;s area of activity rose to $13.7 billion in fiscal 2012, up 5.4 percent from a year before. Such pacts represent orders for future delivery.</p>
<p>In 2012 there were about 65 notifications to Congress of proposed government-brokered foreign military sales with a combined potential value of more than $63 billion. In addition, the State Department office that regulates direct commercial sales was on track to receive more than 85,000 license requests in 2012, a new record.</p>
<p>Overall, the United States reached arms transfer agreements in 2011 totaling $66.3 billion, or nearly 78 percent of all such worldwide pacts, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The 2011 total was swollen by a record $33.4 billion deal with Saudi Arabia. India ranked second with $6.9 billion in such agreements.</p>
