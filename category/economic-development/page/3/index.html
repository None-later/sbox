<p>Especially check out the last one. One panelist&#8217;s description yesterday of putting glasses on a child yesterday was as if it were directly out of the opening of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.booksamillion.com/product/9780802139870?id=4537992433199">Lawrence Norfolk&#8217;s <em>Lemprière&#8217;s Dictionary</em></a>:<br />
<blockquote>The lenses sucked his eye-balls through the frames, dashed them into the first elected object. The stove.  He was in the flames. They were licking greedily at him…behind the flames two eyes caught his, an horrible, misshapen face, a twisted body, eyes black with ancient cruelties, the legs curling and unfurling at him, like serpents. I see you John Lemprière, hissed from each mouth. Erichthonius. Curling and unfurling like snakes. Like flames.  Just flames. Flames in a stove in a room. A room between Minerva’s shrine and Vulcan’s forge.</p>
<p>‘Welcome to the visible world, John Lemprière.&#8217; &#8230;</p>
<p>Lempière shivered and blinked. The stove was but a stove, the room but a room….Lemprière could see.</p></blockquote>
<p>People who have seen miracles want to see them again, not the mention the effect on people for whom seeing is a miracle.</p>

                                <p>This one’s going to be long because a lot of general themes get presented.  Those looking for the shorter version may want to just go to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/">the website</a> and watch the videos.*</p>
<p>William Jefferson Clinton (WJC) introduces the proceedings by giving a background on the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI).  CGI began in 2005, and required each participant to make a specific, measurable commitment.  (This statement is followed by shot of Jessica Alba and Cash Warren, possibly because <a target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0120667/">they started dating that year</a>, but probably just because the director liked the shot.)  Almost all commitments that were made then were multi-year (generally 3- to 5-year commitments).  Five years into the CGI, about one-fourth of the commitments made have been fully completed.  The CGI has, for instance,  given 48 million people better access to health care. (Isn’t that just about what National Health Insurance would do for the US alone? Still, it’s 48 million people who are often ignored.)</p>
<p>There have also been &#8220;unvaluable but invaluable&#8221; effort at reconciliations.  (I checked this; &#8220;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Unvaluable">unvaluable</a>&#8221; is indeed a word.) Unlike other conferences, attendees will receive only a gift bag—the gift to participants is &#8220;only a bag.&#8221;**  Each attendee (not certain if this includes the press, but I assume not) has been allocated 200 “points” that can be used at the “Giving Back Center.” For instance, one can donate “a P&#038;G water filtration system” for 10 points.</p>
<p>I should mention that the organizers and donors to the conference are the clearest indication of the payoff from WJC’s “third way” efforts: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/nyregion/10albany.html?_r=1&#038;pagewanted=print">Tom Golisano</a>, for instance, is cited as a founding and continuing sponsor.  Other major sponsors and donors to the conference include P&#038;G, ExxonMobil, and APCO Worldwide (who are providing Wi-Fi access).  I half expected to see ADM listed. (<a target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/title/tt1130080/">Matt Damon’s appearance</a> sponsored by?)</p>
<p>(That ExxonMobil is a major sponsor of a conference that is placing Climate Change front and center in its discussions [see below] is a sign of either encouragement or a coming paradigm shift.  Perhaps both.</p>
<p>WJC noted that Participants not invited back unless they do something toward their commitment during the year. However, due to the Global Financial Crisis, several previously-made commitments have had to be extended. (Three-year goals have become  five-year goals, fives have become seven.  This mirrors the year in which I expect to be solvent again.)</p>
<p>And then WJC talks about what WJC is best at talking about: po9litics.  He notes that there are two questions that are asked in any political discussion: 1) What are you going to do? 2) How much money are you going to spend on it?  Politicians almost never discuss how to do it to maximize positive impact in other people’s life.  And it is that discussion that the CGI is all about.</p>
<p>He proceeds then to introduce a pairing that was made possible by last year’s CGI: Gary White and Matt Damon of <a target="_blank" href="http://water.org/watercredit">water.org</a>.  The statistics flow from his (WJC’s) tongue: one billion people lack water, and 2.5 billion lack sanitation facilities.  He loves this, and it&#8217;s somewhat infectious.</p>
<p>Water.org is an outgrowth, I gather, work that Gary White has been doing since 1990.  Mr.White describes the economy before Watercredit was founded, where people paid 25% of their gross income for clean water, or had to borrow money from loan sharks at 125% interest rates to install toilets. By combining microfinance with technology transfer, water credit was able to ameliorate this situation in many areas—and its loans are repaid 97% of the time. I can think of several mortgage lenders who would like that repayment ratio.</p>
<p>Matt Damon then announced a new commitment for <a target="_blank" href="http://water.org/">water.org</a>, in that they are extending their efforts into Haiti, where 51% of the rural population lacks clean drinking water and 29% of the urban population lacks proper sanitation facilities. They are able to do this in part due to a generous commitment from <a target="_blank" href="http://exitfoundation.org/">the Ex;it Foundation</a>.  Many organizations are getting some good, useful publicity here.</p>
<p>The next presenter is Linda Lockhart of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.globalgivebackcircle.org/">Global Give Back Circle</a>, whose group is devoted to Educational Progress in Kenya for girls. Again, the source for this group was through CGI Connect.   (Ms. Lockhart claims to have been surprised when she entered the keywords for her group’s goal [education, women] and immediately received multiple responses from organizations. (We clearly do not travel in the same circles.) The group’s efforts were rewarded when they discovered one of the root causes of women dropping out: lack of shoes.  Teaming up with, among others, Microsoft, they presented the feel-good moment of the Opening Ceremonies with three Kenyan girls speaking&#8211;often in unison, sometimes sotto voce—about the good that Global Giveback Circle did for them.</p>
<p>At this point, the Plenary Session begins.  WJC introduces Muhtar Kent, President and CEO of Coke.  Mr. Kent speaks how Equal allocation of resources in Sub-Saharan Africa would, in and of itself, increase production 10-20%.  In the current situation, women’s mobility is severely more restricted than men’s, of course.  Kent, too, seems amazed to have learned this.</p>
<p>Kent is followed by Michelle Bachelet, current President of Chile and also, the first female defense minister in Latin America. Being a female politician, she not only has noticed but also has a strong interest in “soft” issues.</p>
<p>Mike Duke, the current CEO of Wal-Mart (WMT), ran the International Division before ascending to the chairmanship. WJC notes that WMT now offers health insurance to its employees, as well as having made a major effort to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. (WJC stated, I believe, that WMT’s stock began rallying only when they announced their “global warming initiative.”  I cannot find the evidence of this, though I didn’t do a thorough search.) Duke notes that a 5% reduction in their packaging alone was the equivalent of taking 210,000 diesel trucks off road. (And it saved them money.  This theme will recur throughout from the CEOs.)</p>
<p>After this, WJC introduces Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, describing him as having spoken about climate change in “excruciating detail,” which may well be the first time someone has done that to WJC instead of the reverse.  Rudd notes that Australia is the country that has been the hardest hit by Anthropogenic Global Warming, and is the leading proponent of the other first-day theme: the G-8 giving way to G-20.</p>
<p>The particpants&#8217;s discussion on a Rock Following.</p>
<p>*If they post them; let me know in comments if you can find the video on the site and I&#8217;ll add a direct link.</p>
<p>**Compare with most conferences, where you get a bag and almost enough &#8220;swag&#8221; to cover the retail cost of the membership (which, for attendees, was $1,000 minimum).</p>

                                <p>The one thing that got both daughters excited last night was &#8220;You&#8217;re going to see the President!&#8221;  Didn&#8217;t have the heart to tell them it would probably be from a separate room.</p>
<p>And, indeed, space upstairs maxed one. It&#8217;s 3:40; Barack H. Obama is scheduled to speak in about twenty minutes, though I might bet that it will start late, since everything else has. (You try scheduling a meeting with two Presidents, the current leaders of Chile and Australia, and the Presidents of Wal-Mart and Coca-Cola—and that&#8217;s just the scheduled Plenary speakers—and not have things run late.)</p>
<p>The food is very good, and the teas are good (and all too useful), though they have run out of lemon.</p>
<p>Hoping the second session (leaders of three more countries—Turkey, the Netherlands, and Argentina—; security has been amazingly efficient and polite) and the head of the IMF to present.</p>
<p>The Really Good Stuff starts tomorrow.</p>

                                <p>It&#8217;s true that I have been a bit nastier than usual with some posts (especially <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/09/plural-of-datum-is-foreboding.html">this one</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/09/coming-soon-from-major-economists-near.html">this one</a>—though the latter was rather justified by preceding events, <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/09/travels-of-cheap-tire-in-global-economy.html">as Tom detailed</a>.) The sight of economists who should know better saying &#8220;Ewww, tariffs&#8221; in the manner of second grade boys who think girls have &#8220;cooties&#8221; is rather tiring.  It&#8217;s almost as if they note that a strong rule of law is necessary to ensure that problems of asymmetric information are remedied and then complaining when those laws are actually used.  Oh, wait&#8230;</p>
<p>Part of this is that people who should know better—maybe not Max B., but certainly Barry O.—keep pretending that Democrats have no obligation to be better than Republicans at addressing issues of inequality and opportunity.  In which case one might as well vote for Republicans, if one can find those small-government, fiscally-conservative candidates that only Andrew Samwick seems to believe still exists.</p>
<p>But I am cautiously optimistic today. Thanks to <a target="_blank" href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/">Lance Mannion</a>, I&#8217;ll be spending most of this week blogging/reporting the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.clintonglobalinitiative.org/">Clinton Global Initiative</a> in New York City. While many of the participants are The Usual Suspects, there is at least some hope that they will approach the world better than they appear to approach their electorate.</p>
<p>If there is anything, especially on Thursday, that someone especially wants to cover, feel free to note it in comments. (Or, if you&#8217;re going to be there, say hello.)</p>

<p><em>Gather all around the camp fire and enjoy your marsh mellow toasting as I tell you the fable of the “The Guitar Player who sold his gear”.  Long ago in a far away land of rock and roll there was a young man who played well.  Not great, wasn&#8217;t going to necessarily be a guitar hero, but who knows?  He had the gear, the amp to make your ears ring for days, the gold top Les Paul, couple pedals, cables&#8230;all he needed.  And he played.  Jammed, earned some money on the side.  Life was good.  But, along came another desire.  He needed some money and the playing was becoming less as life with the loved one became more.  So, he sold it.  All of it.  He had maybe $1 thousand in gear.  He got $500 for it.  It seemed good at the time.  He had gotten his use of it all, made some bucks but it really was just money sitting there it seemed.  </p>
<p>A few years pass, the kids grow up and the man has some spare time.  He has been dabbling on a folk guitar for years, so when he hears that a friend is jamming on Thursday nights, he gets an urge.  That potential just sitting there to be tapped, but&#8230;no gear.  No problem, he&#8217;ll just buy some.  The only problem is, when he first goes to practice and sees the friends  2 Les Pauls and a jazz box, 2 ear killing amps and bottoms, a full board of pedals worth what he sold his gear for, he wonders how the friend did it and thus how is he going to do it.  It was thousands in gear.  The friend answers: I never sell any of my music equipment because it is part of my life activities, it makes me who I am, it helps me think and you never know what will come up for an opportunity.</em></p>
<p>Such a fable is common among those who used to play music.</p>
<p>I have written at AB that my thoughts about when the flash point was for our change to a focus on making money from money was the first Reagan election.  I do believe this is the case however, having finished reading Richard J Elkus&#8217; book, <em><strong>Winner Take All</strong></em>, I now have learned of a perspective as to why it flashed and why we are bailing out finance with more money and fewer questions than bailing out the auto industry.  I also see just how back ass-ward this bailing out concern is.</p>
<p>You see, the thought that the purpose of business is to make money was not always the winner in the argument.  The argument has been back and forth for ages.  It is part of the class war.  In fact, there was a movie in 1954 with William Holden looking at this issue called <a href="http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=3001">Executive Suite</a>. <br />
<blockquote>&#8230;McDonald Walling, who oversees the company&#8217;s manufacturing plant and is preparing to test a new molding process&#8230; process did not go well in his absence. On the way home, he complains to his wife Mary that financial analyst Loren Phineas Shaw focuses on the bottom line at the expense of the company&#8217;s creativity&#8230;McDonald speaks passionately about the company, condemning Shaw&#8217;s short-sighted emphasis on quick profits as &#8220;a lack of faith in the future.&#8221; After McDonald outlines his vision for restoring the company to its former high standards, the board unanimously elects him president.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have not always thought that the purpose of business is just to make money.</p>
<p>Mr. Elkus&#8217; (MBA) thesis is that in the 60&#8217;s, two laws of economic process were formalized and presented that were the guiding thoughts influencing economic development.  Both lines of thinking came from viewing the same show: semiconductors.  One is by Mr. Bruce Henderson (engineer and MBA degrees) the other by Mr. Gordon Moore (PhD chemistry).  Both addressed the relationship of costs and production.  I note the degrees of each just as a curiosity.  </p>
<p>Mr. Henderson, watching Texas Instrument, came up with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_curve_effects">Experience Curve</a>.  In it&#8217;s simplest form it states that unit cost goes down over time as experience increases.</p>
<p>But, this was just the bases for a broader concept, a “strategy” for guiding business development: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Growth-share_matrix">Stars, Cash Cows and Dogs</a>.<br />
<blockquote>As a particular industry matures and its growth slows, all business units become either cash cows or dogs. The natural cycle for most business units is that they start as question marks, then turn into stars. Eventually the market stops growing thus the business unit becomes a cash cow. At the end of the cycle the cash cow turns into a dog.</p>
<p>The overall goal of this ranking was to help corporate analysts decide which of their business units to fund, and how much; and which units to sell.</p></blockquote>
<p>This was and appears to still be a very big concept.  Big as in influential.  Via Wiki:<br />
<blockquote>The Economist magazine stated that Henderson did more to change the way business is done in the United States than any other man in American business history. Well known to many now is the famous Growth Share Matrix (&#8216;cash cow&#8217;) and the &#8216;Experience curve&#8217;. His books were published in 27 languages.</p></blockquote>
<p>Huge influence.  Taught throughout our business schools according to Mr. Elkus and Wiki.  Came about in 1970.  </p>
<p>Mr. Moore, being a founder of semiconductor manufacturing businesses, namely Intel, came up with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law">Moore&#8217;s Law</a>.  In it&#8217;s simplest form, it states that there would be <em>“a doubling  of computing power per given area of silicon every year at basically the same cost&#8230;”</em>  <br />Mr. Elkus&#8217;s thesis is that both describe models, ultimately truths regarding making money.  Both are used as strategies for basing an economy upon.  Only one is truly sustainable and makes all of America&#8217;s dreams possible.  Japan picked that one.   </p>
<p>He comes to this by way of his involvement with Ampex.  Ampex owned video recording <em>“&#8230;controlling nearly 100 percent of the world&#8217;s video recording patents and more than 70 % of the market”</em>.  Mr. Elkus literally introduced the first video recorder for home use, September 2, 1970 in NY.  In the next few days, Ampex stock climbed 50%.  Only one VP attended, no other top/senior management.  <em>“It was not a good sign.”</em>  His lesson from the event: <em>“The introduction of Instavideo set in motion a long chain of events, resulting not only in the explosion of consumer electronics into nearly every facet of daily life but in a global shift in economic power to Asia.”</em></p>
<p>In the same year, he saw a presentation of high definition video by Japan&#8217;s  “primary” broadcasting company, NHK.  It is at this point in the story Mr. Elkus relays the concept of convergence of technology.  The ability to record video on a consumer level scale represented the ability to store and process massive amounts of data.  This ability converging with digital video presentation meant that the entire information economy would be exponentially growing based on Moore&#8217;s Law.  Mr. Henderson&#8217;s potential Star.  Moore&#8217;s law also meant that as the ability to process ever larger amounts of data on ever smaller media, the cost would be ever greater.  Mr. Henderson&#8217;s potential Dog.  What to do?</p>
<p>Mr. Elkus knew Ampex needed a partner that could take the technology to the consumer.  Coming up with the technology, he recognized is only part of the expertise and cost, the other is the ability to manufacture it such that technology, in short, is dummy proof in the hands of the consumer.  It is an ability all of it&#8217;s own.  Mr. Elkus wanted Magnavox or Motorola as partners; keep it in the country.  The boss said no, feared competition so went with Toshiba.  This gets us to the next part of Mr. Elkus&#8217; thesis: Infrastructure.  Which gets to the final cog in the process: investment.</p>
<p>Using his experience with Ampex&#8217;s Instavideo, Mr. Elkus presents the counter to Mr. Henderson&#8217;s Stars, Cash Cow&#8217;s and Dogs:  Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure.  A relational model that follows the production law of Moore.  </p>
<p>What the thesis of Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure means to a nation is presented in the tracing of the loss of our manufacturing base to initially Japan and ultimately to all of Asia.  It is the counter to Mr. Henderson&#8217;s model which is basically just focusing on the money.  It is the movie Executive Suite for real only for us, the story ending is looking different.  </p>
<p>The relationship of Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure is presented early in the book via Zenith.  There was a fight for control of the board as reported by the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/24/business/company-news-zenith-criticizes-dissident-group.html">AP 11/1988</a>.  A couple Wall Streeters wanted Zenith to dump the <em>“money-losing television business”.  </em>The dog.  The article also noted: <em>“for an outsider, jumping into the TV business would be like trying to hop onto a speeding train&#8230;”</em> In the end, Zenith a company that <em>“helped establish the standards for high definition television in the US,&#8230; contributing significant technology for the potential development of the industry”</em> was gone by 1996 to LG of Korea <em>“for a fraction of what it now costs to build a single display manufacturing facility”.  </em>We lost our infrastructure and thus the advantage of economic growth based on convergence and all the knowledge that is the result there of because of our focus on cash flow as the bases for deciding on where to invest.  </p>
<p>Using a simpler example:<br />
<blockquote>In 1964, one year before Gordon Moore wrote his prophetic article, semiconductor sales reached $1 billion.  Today sales are in excess of $260 billion, it is projected that in a dozen years the number may reach $1 trillion.  And growth in revenue has occurred while prices have dropped at an average compound rate of 29 % annually&#8230;But that is really chump change when you realize that $260 billion of silicon makes possible a $2 trillion electronic systems industry today&#8230;So it is possible to imagine an electronic systems market  approaching $4 trillion to $5 trillion in the next twelve to fifteen years—an amount equal to the current GDP of Japan&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The error of US having followed Henderson, which if I understand Elkus properly, I conclude has lead to NAFTA, outsourcing jobs and ultimately the fight over whether to save our auto industry (which I noted is the last “infrastructure” we have that uses “convergence” via “investment”) verses little questioning to save the banks is summarized thusly:<br />
<blockquote>The common denominator driving the world of information and its communications infrastructure was the need to store, process  and distribute extraordinary amounts of digital information.  [Store = Ampex.  Process = Intel.  Distribute = Zenith.]  If one understands HDTV as the result of learning how to process massive amounts of digital information, as both a convergence and catalyst in the digital revolution, then it should be easy to see that the need to process that information is not limited to the HDTV display and a pretty picture&#8230;. </p></blockquote>
<p>It now costs upward of $10 billion to build just one semiconductor manufacturing plant.  $3 billion to build a single display fabrication facility.  Zenith was sold for $350 million.  Based on <a href="http://www.measuringworth.com/calculators/compare/">Measuring Worth</a>, 1996 to 2008 these money minds following Henderson, sold Zenith for 1/6th the cost required to build just one display panel plant in 2008.  This number differential is the total fallacy in Henderson.  How do you know?  How do you know what really is the next big thing?  How can you be sure that nothing else will come of what you have?  It is the &#8220;The Guitar Player&#8221;.  But worst of all as shown in the example of selling Zenith, is just how short sighted Henderson&#8217;s thinking and thus American business thinking is in general.  If I may, Henderson&#8217;s thinking is analogous to watching your rear view mirror while driving forward as you decide whether to turn or drive straight.  Henderson&#8217;s thinking is the point of thought that began the money from money economy.  It is the thought that lead us to a purposeless existence of no substance because it leaves unanswered the question of why do we want to earn money or create wealth, for what purpose.  </p>
<p>Mr. Elkus gave a <a href="http://fora.tv/2008/09/03/Richard_Elkus_Competitiveness_Shapes_the_Fate_of_Nations">talk at The Commonwealth Club</a> in California on 9/3/08.  It covers a time line of what he is writes in his book.  It is one hour long, but well worth the time, especially <a href="http://fora.tv/2008/09/03/Richard_Elkus_Competitiveness_Shapes_the_Fate_of_Nations#chapter_15">the question at the end</a> regarding Apple&#8217;s business arrangement regarding it&#8217;s Iphone as the questioner brings up “competitive advantage” and money from royalties.  You know, that information/service economy model that has gotten us to the point that the biggest service sector (finance) took down the economy and the next largest is unaffordable(health care).</p>
<p>The most profound comment by Mr. Elkus during this lecture is: <strong><em>If you don&#8217;t have the infrastructure, then you don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s possible.</em></strong></p>
<p>How far reaching is this persepctive of Investment, Convergence and Infrastructure?  Mr. Elkus suggests that even our <a href="http://www.theglobalist.com/StoryId.aspx?StoryId=7285">education system</a> is influenced by it.<br />
<blockquote>When a nation’s politics and economics fall out of step with its education system, the cost of reengagement is extraordinarily high. </p>
<p>Therefore any attempt to explain the plight of education in America must look first at the country’s current political and economic attitudes. They are directly linked. </p>
<p>Eventually, because of the exponential acceleration in convergence, infrastructure, and investment, there’s a cascading effect, and the loss of one industry begins to threaten the stability of others. </p>
<p>These events are noticed by the educational community, which must provide a measure of career guidance for its student population and thus looks to political, economic, and business leaders for answers.</p></blockquote>
<p>We have Intel fortunately, but we don&#8217;t have the infrastructure of Zenith which would have been using Intels output to market Ampex&#8217;s technology which lead to the Iphone.</p>

                                <p>Ken Houghton remembers that Warren Buffett famously groused that he pays a lower percentage of his income in taxes than his secretary.  Or the person who will come up with an actual cure for a cancer.</p>
<p>Mark Cuban takes this one step further, <a target="_blank" href="http://blogmaverick.com/2009/08/18/some-thoughts-on-the-economy/">pointing out the obvious</a>: if we want to promote investment, &#8220;we should tax the trader/speculator more heavily than the investor.[emphasis his]&#8221;</p>
<p>When you make the tax rate the same for short-term investment as long-term—and lower than that on income—you create the perverse incentive to taking profits in the short-term, making the &#8220;capital&#8221; investment equivalent to a Demand Deposit account.  If you want to reward capital investment, it needs to be truly treated as capital. Cuban notes:<br />
<blockquote>The government should raises taxes significantly on profits from short term capital gains on the sale of public stocks, indexes, commodities, futures held for 24 hours or less and extend the length of time required to qualify for Long Term capital gains and reduce the tax rate on Long Term gains.</p></blockquote>
<p>It might be difficult to reduce the already-less-than-minimal tax rate on long-term gains. (Last time I checked, the capital gain on a five-year investment is taxed at 8%.) But it would be no problem at all raising the rate on short-term trades back to where it should be—above that of ordinary income tax rates.  And even a budget-balancing approach would leave plenty of room to lower the rate for legitimately long-term holdings.</p>
<p>Cuban makes the connection: one of the reasons the tax incentives need to be moved is the perversion they have made of Corporate Governance:<br />
<blockquote>[Raising taxes on short-term trades and lowering them on long-term investments] will also reward companies that act in the financial interests of long term holders and their employers. I think the impact on the economy would be far fewer layoffs as CEOs find themselves with more shareholders who think long term rather than short term. Believe it or not, there are shareholders who are fine with companies not beating their numbers if the company is making progress towards a clearly defined goal&#8230;.Taxation can change the focus on public companies and stock trading. That would be a great thing for the economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Cuban notes that there is still the major problem of misaligned incentives in Executive Compensation (economist&#8217;s version <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w15165">here</a> [PDF, subscription required]):<br />
<blockquote>CEOs&#8230;are so focused on marking to market their own personal stock portfolios, they emphasize stock performance over doing the right thing for the company.</p></blockquote>
<p>Amazingly, this is exactly the problem that standard economic theory claims &#8220;professional&#8221; management solved.  I hope this one makes it into <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;as_q=&#038;as_epq=Refuted+economic+doctrines&#038;as_oq=&#038;as_eq=&#038;num=10&#038;lr=&#038;as_filetype=&#038;ft=i&#038;as_sitesearch=crookedtimber.org&#038;as_qdr=all&#038;as_rights=&#038;as_occt=any&#038;cr=&#038;as_nlo=&#038;as_nhi=&#038;safe=images">John Quiggin&#8217;s book</a>.</p>

<p>Taxes are always fun, and there&#8217;s a few other things going on.  But, really, let me quote the Internet&#8217;s best current stylist (meaning prose, not hair), Susan of Texas, in a post called, appropriately, &#8220;<a target="blank" href="http://agonyin8fits.blogspot.com/2009/08/tired.html">Tired</a>&#8220;:<br />
<blockquote>The multitude of stupid out there in the health care discussion is beyond belief and utterly debilitating. This nation is simply too stupid to survive and I can&#8217;t deal with any more today&#8230;.reason and evidence don&#8217;t matter any more&#8211;stupid will win the day.</p>
<p>I believe that the economy is far worse off than people want to admit and that we will be permanently poorer; at least, some of us will&#8230;.I don&#8217;t expect an apocalypse or a return to 1800s bucolic splendor; I think we&#8217;ll just gradually get poorer and poorer, while telling ourselves that everyone else in the world has it much worse whether it is true or not.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read the Whole Thing.  Not just because she said it, but also because that&#8217;s what the Canadians and Brits with whom I was speaking over the past few months are all expecting as well.</p>
<p>If the drugs I can&#8217;t afford in the States kick in, maybe I&#8217;ll explain to Scott how <a target="blank" href="http://lefarkins.blogspot.com/2009/08/self-inflicted-wounds.html">this post</a> demonstrates that Dick Cheney is a better politician than BarryO and Rahm Emanuel combined.  But you already know that, and Scott in his heart probably does to.</p>

                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Tilman Tacke and I are quite cautious in <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/income-distribution-infant-mortality.html">this paper</a> which does not support my pet theory described in <a target="_blank" href="http://ideas.repec.org/a/tpr/qjecon/v107y1992i4p1283-302.html">this paper</a>.  The stylized fact (which has returned after a brief absence from the data) is that, given the income of poorer quintiles, where the rich are richer more babies die.  My pet theory is that this is due to &#8220;distortion of consumption&#8221; where the poor imitate the consumption of the rich (which is more costly the richer the rich are) and this foolish spending causes infant mortality.</p>
<p>It turns out that this bold idea wasn&#8217;t totally new after all.  I just found it in <br />The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith first published in 1776.</p>
<p>I explain after the jump.</p>
<p>The idea appears really really appears on page 1103 (Book 5 Chapter 2 article 4 section 2 &#8220;taxes  on consumable commodities&#8221;) of my copy of The Wealth of Nations by Adam Smith published in 1776.<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Consumable commodities are either luxuries or necessaries,</p>
<p>By necessaries I understand not only the commodities which are indispensably necessary for the support of life, but whatever the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, to be without.  A linen shirt, for example, is, strictly speaking, not a necessary of life.  The Greeks and Romans lived, I suppose, very comfortably though they had no linen.  But in the present times, through the greater part of Europe, a creditable day lobourer would be ashamed to appear in public without a linen shirt, the want of which would be supposed to denote that disgraceful degree of poverty, which, it is presumed, no body can well fall into without extreme bad conduct.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>He argues that, therefore taxes on necessaries will drive up wages in the long run.<br />To understand you have to know Smith&#8217;s theory of wages which is that the steady state wage is such that population neither grows nor shrinks and at a lower wage population will shrink due to increased mortality due to poverty. So his claim is that taxing necessaries, including linen shirts in Europe in 1776, would cause the population to decline due to increased mortality.  This only makes sense if he believes that, in order to wear a linen shirt, Europeans of his day would skimp on food to an extent which increased the mortality of their children.</p>
<p>This is made very clear when, in contrast, Smith argues that a tax on luxuries consumed by the poor will not affect wages in the long run<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The different taxes which have in the course of the present century been imposed on spirituous liquors, are not supposed to have had any effect on the wages of labour. &#8230;<br />The high price of such commodities does not necessarily diminish the ability of the inferior ranks of people to bring up families.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>That is a high price of linen shirts will necessarily diminish the ability of the inferior ranks of people to bring up families &#8230; by causing their children to die.</p>
<p>Smith definitely did not consider any form of contraception including abstinence.  He is quite clear on the idea that steady state wages are determined by infant and child mortality in book 1 chapter 8.</p>
<p>To get to causation rich are richer so more babies die one just needs to add that average standards of living affect what goods &#8220;the custom of the country renders it indecent for creditable people, to be without.&#8221;</p>
<p>So I guess I wasn&#8217;t the first to come up with the idea.  However, I was only 216 years late.</p>
<p>The most flaky far out interpretation of the stylized fact (destroyed by including pubhealth anyway) is clearly stated in The Wealth of Nations.  Wow.</p>
