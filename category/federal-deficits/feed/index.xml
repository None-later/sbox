<p> History Lesson &#8211; Deficits as a % of GDP, Tax Rates </p>
<p>DISCLAIMER: This is not a defense of Bush II. Just the facts on the deficit, and a further discussion of sectoral balances and some tax rate info.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at some history, because the belief is that Bush II ran the biggest budget deficits ever, and ruined the Clinton surpluses. I wish we did not spend so much on the military under Bush. However, the Bush deficits were not that large as a % of GDP. His father, and Reagan ran bigger ones. The deficits were not that far off where we were at the end of the 70&#8217;s either. Now keep in mind, that the trade deficit does factor in &#8211; been having trouble assembling historical data on this. When running a trade deficit we need to run a federal deficit to keep the private sector in balance. <br />See <a href="http://www.creditwritedowns.com/2011/02/government-deficits-and-the-financial-sectors-balances.html">Credit write downs</a>  on sectoral balances:</p>
<p>The key formulas is as follows:</p>
<p>Domestic Private Balance + Domestic Government Balance + Foreign Balance = 0<br />Via <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/the-growing-government-deficit-actually-means-savings-for-the-private-sector-2011-2#ixzz2NZIXVitT">Business Insider</a> L Randall Wray</p>
<p>Lastly, the Obama deficits are exactly what we needed to make up for the deficits that were probably too small under Clinton and Bush II.</p>
<p>Now, much of the talk on historical Tax Rates focuses on marginal rates- I found this table to be quite interesting as it looks beyond the top marginal rates, and breaks out lower income folks.</p>

<p>Data is for 3 groups 1/2 median income; Median Income ; Twice Median income respectively </p>
<p>Year &#8212; Average Combined Rates for each group that includes payroll taxes and EITC , and the last numbers are the top and bottom marginal rates that excludes payroll taxes ( I just sampled a few years, go to the link to see more. I used average cause that better reflects what one actually pays) :</p>
