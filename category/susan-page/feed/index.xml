<div>Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney escalated his attacks on President Barack Obama&#8217;s welfare waivers Monday, suggesting that welfare recipients make up President Barack Obama&#8217;s political &#8220;base.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In an <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-08-26/romney-interview-campaign/57331498/1?loc=interstitialskip" target="_hplink">interview with <em>USA Today</em></a>, Romney defended his much-criticized <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/20/mitt-romney-welfare-ad_n_1810134.html" target="_hplink">ads</a>, which falsely accuse the president of removing the work requirement in welfare. He insisted that the spots were accurate and that Obama had pursued his policy as part of an electoral calculation.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;There&#8217;s no question in my mind that the president&#8217;s action was calculated to&#8230; shore up his base,&#8221; Romney said, according to an extended quote that <em>USA Today</em> provided to The Huffington Post. &#8220;Weakening the work requirement in welfare is an enormous mistake.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8212; <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/27/mitt-romney-welfare-waivers_n_1832871.html?utm_hp_ref=mostpopular">Mitt Romney Suggests Obama Welfare Waivers Are A Tactic To &#8216;Shore UpHis Base&#8217;</a>, Luke Johnson, Sam Stein, Huffington Post, today
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Two current Republican governors support Obama’s reelection?  Wow. That’s a very big political story! And apparently it&#8217;s true!  Since two of the five governors who requested the waiver that Obama granted in order to fire up his base are Republicans (presumably expecting that Obama would grant the waiver requests in order to fire his base), those two Republican governors must be in cahoots with Obama. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And since virtually no one—members of Obama’s now-fired-up base, included—even <i>knew </i>of the waiver requests and the waiver grants until the Romney campaign made sure they and everyone else (including Romney’s base) did, it seems that the Romney campaign also wants to fire up Obama’s base.  Not to mention their own.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Didn&#8217;t know that Obama&#8217;s &#8220;base,&#8221; er, base, had been clamoring for welfare waivers. Then again, I didn&#8217;t know that Utah&#8217;s and Nevada&#8217;s Republican governors were part of that base.  I mean, who knew?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Oh, brother.
