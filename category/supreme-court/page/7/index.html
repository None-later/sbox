<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2261947/">Dahlia Lithwick, in Slate</a> writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>At the Citizens United [v. Federal Election Commission] argument last fall, Roberts openly criticized Kagan for abandoning one rationale for restricting corporate campaign spending and then pummeled her again in his concurring opinion in the case, dismissing the government&#8217;s argument as ‘at odds with itself.’ In an April case, Kagan took the position that U.S. attorneys speak only for their regional offices, not for the attorney general of the United States ‘That&#8217;s absolutely startling,’ Roberts replied. ‘The United States is a complicated place,’ Kagan retorted. ‘I take your word for it,’ Roberts snapped back. …</p>
<p>“Then Roberts took yet another whack at Kagan in his opinion in Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, over a statute criminalizing the provision of ‘material support’ to terror groups. Roberts, while handing the victory to Kagan, repeatedly called out the government position for going ‘too far’ and running ‘headlong into a number of our precedents.’” </p></blockquote>
<p>The point of Lithwick’s article—its title and subtitle are “Roberts v. Kagan? Will there be friction between the chief justice and Elena Kagan on the Supreme Court?”—is that in most of the six cases before the Court this past term in which Kagan was lead counsel, apparently drafting the briefs largely herself, and then representing the federal government at oral argument—Roberts implied that he thought her handling of the respective case bordered on the incompetent. </p>
<p>Lithwick links to a more in-depth report and analysis of the exchanges by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/15/us/politics/15scotus.html?_r=1">New York Times Supreme Court correspondent Adam Liptak published in the Times</a> on April 14, before the close of the Court’s term. And in reviewing the instances that Liptak mentions, Roberts’ oral and written critiques of Kagan’s judgment calls strike me as suggesting that Kagan failed to recognize that the Office of Solicitor General is not some regional insurance-defense law firm or a regular local presence on behalf of state and municipal governments and their employees in run-of-the-mill lawsuits alleging violation of civil rights. Or, for that matter, a county prosecutor or state assistant attorney general. </p>
<p>All of whom always, always make arguments on behalf of their clients that are at odds with itself, or at least at odds with the argument they made successfully during the last round of motions and now find it expedient to pretend they had not. And who casually assert facts or positions of law that are every bit as transparently silly, or to borrow from Roberts, absolutely startling, as Kagan’s claim that U.S. attorneys speak only for their regional offices and not for the attorney general of the United States.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />I loathe Roberts, whose personal hallmarks as a justice (and before that as a nominee) are, best as I can tell, trickery and duplicity. So it’s a pleasant surprise that he found Kagan’s no-position-is-beyond-the-pale style of advocacy intolerably amateurish for a United States Solicitor General. But Roberts was truly a top appellate litigator, who regularly argued against other truly top appellate litigators, usually on behalf of very important clients, making awfully significant arguments about major issues of law. So he apparently thinks that there is a level of situational importance at which the cheap gimmicks should not be employed. And key First Amendment cases before the Supreme Court are among them, and the Solicitor General is someone who should recognize that. Most past solicitor generals did, after all. </p>
<p>So Roberts is right, but he does not go nearly far enough. It is by now deeply institutionalized throughout this country that attorneys who represent the government, and therefore, ostensibly, “the people,” use the same type of obstructionist, dilatory and even flagrantly dishonest tactics and gimmicks as attorneys representing private parties. Even—perhaps especially—in the service of preserving criminal convictions in the face of hard evidence that the conviction was wrongful, sometimes obtained in honest error, other times obtained through police or prosecutorial misconduct. </p>
<p>Which brings me to Pat Lykos, the current Harris County, TX district attorney, who upon being sworn in established a Post Conviction Review Section whose purpose is to actually investigate cases of possible wrongful convictions. An <a target="_blank" href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/metropolitan/7128807.html">article published last week in the Houston Chronicle</a> is about the release, after 27 years’ imprisonment, of a man convicted of rape upon the sole basis of the victim’s ostensible identification of him. </p>
<p>But actually the ones who identified him—Michael Green is his name—were the police officers who arrested him on the night of the rape; he was walking in the area, the officers detained him, and when the victim did not initially identify him in a lineup, she was shown suggestive photos to ensure that in a second lineup, she did. According to the article, the attorneys and investigators in the newly-created Post Conviction Review Section who were assigned to the case found “a pair of jeans stored in a warehouse that had been worn by the victim during the crime, then testing it for DNA evidence. The results excluded Green.”</p>
<p>Three men committed the rape. The article says Lykos’ office “has identified all four men suspected in the crime, including the three believed to have sexually assaulted the victim.” But the statute of limitations prevents their prosecution.</p>
<p>The article quotes from comments by Lykos’ first assistant, a man named Jim Leitner, in a news release about Green’s release: “The evidence in this case had been sitting in the District Clerk&#8217;s Office for 27 years, and no one had taken the initiative to do anything with it in the past. The difference now is that you&#8217;ve got the Post Conviction Review Section looking into it &#8211; and that made all the difference in the case of Mr. Green.”</p>
<p>The Chronicle writer characterized Leitner’s statement as a “slam [against] prior district attorney administrations for the length of time the case stalled.” </p>
<p>The article mentions that another prisoner, someone named Allen Porter, was released from prison a few days before Green’s release. He had been imprisoned for 19 years. Lykos’ office had uncovered evidence of his innocence, too. </p>
<p>John Roberts is hardly a probable crusader against the modern, but by now deeply-rooted, culture among government lawyers in which they role-play as mechanically and mindlessly as, say, a lawyer representing a mob figure, or one representing BP. And in recent decades, unabashed sleaze is as much the purview of big-name law practice as it is some of the old-style ambulance chasers; Roberts surely knows that.</p>
<p>But unless his distain for the phenomenon of government lawyers as over-the-top-and-under-the-sewer-line litigators is limited to those who by dint of their very high office cannot hide under the radar, or whose opponents or victims just don’t matter to him, he may, however improbably, prompt a major change in the very nature of government law practice. And of what it means to represent “the people.”</p>
<p>As for Kagan, well, who knows? Liptak’s article is titled “Stints in Court May Yield Clues to Style.” Hopefully, those stints aren’t clues to her substance as a justice, as well.</p>

                                <p><strong>by Beverly Mann</strong><br />originally posted at the <a target="_blank" href="http://annarborist.blogspot.com/">Annarborist</a></p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://annarborist.blogspot.com/2010/06/paul-clement-in-appreciation.html">Paul Clement, In Appreciation</a> </p>
<p>Each year as the Supreme Court’s term ends in late June, Slate’s main legal-issues writer, Dahlia Lithwick joins with Walter Dellinger, head of mega law firm O’Mebeny &#038; Meyers’ national appellate practice, and a former head of the Office of Legal Counsel in the Clinton administration, in a weeklong discussion about the Court’s recent opinions, their effects, and the apparent internal dynamics among the justices during the term. This year, they’re joined by Paul Clement, head of mega law firm King &#038; Spaulding’s national appellate practice and solicitor general during George W. Bush’s second term. </p>
<p>Dahlia began the discussion last week by welcoming Clement to the group and expressing her deep admiration for him. </p>
<p>I share Dahlia’s admiration of Paul Clement, but not just because he is a brilliant legal analyst and has an uncanny ability to argue that analysis incredibly cogently—both traits he shares with my favorite Supreme Court litigator, Jeffrey Fisher—but also because as solicitor general he occasionally had the government take positions as an amicus that departed from robotic Republican ideology, and did so also in at least one case recently as a private practitioner.</p>
<p>I still recall vividly the elation that I and (I know) others felt in 2006 when as solicitor general he filed an amicus brief for the government urging the Court to grant a certiorari petition filed on behalf of an autistic child and his parents in a case called Winkelman v. Parma City School District. The case presented the issue of whether the parents of a handicapped child could serve as surrogate parties on behalf of their child in a lawsuit against a school board, claiming a violation of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, when the parents and child were not represented by an attorney because (although middle class) they could not afford one. Legal fees would have cost tens of thousands of dollars. The lower federal appeals court had threatened to dismiss the lawsuit unless the parents retained counsel to represent the child. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />The Court did grant the certiorari petition. Clement then filed an amicus brief for government supporting the Winkelmans’ claim that they and their son were entitled to access to court without having to retain counsel first. </p>
<p>Justice Kennedy wrote an eloquent and unanimous opinion for the Court ruling in favor of the parents and the child. </p>
<p>Later Clement, as a lawyer in private practice, brought his very considerable personal prestige to a case called Perdue v. Kenny A, in which he represented Kenny A., one of 3,000 abused and neglected children in Georgia’s foster-care system, and the children’s lawyer, who a lower federal court had awarded a larger-than-normal attorney’s fee under a federal statute that provides for the award of attorneys’ fees in successful civil rights lawsuits such as that one. The Court effectively ruled against the Kenny A. petitioners, in an opinion that barely disguises that that is what the Court did. </p>
<p>So much of conservative Republican jurisprudence—far, far more than the general public is aware—centers around simply (very simply, actually) denying most people access to court at all in constitutional or statutory civil rights cases. Paul Clement obviously does not share the right’s affection for that agenda.</p>

<p>The Supreme Court handed down its decision in Bilski Monday, holding, as almost everyone had predicted, that the hedging process that was the subject of the Bilski claim was unpatentable.  <a target="_blank" href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/files/bilski-at-scotus-08-964.pdf">Download Bilski at SCOTUS 08-964</a>. The question for those of us following the case, of course, was not whether the Court would consider the claim patentable.  The question was on what  ground the Court would rest its decision and whether the decision would shed any light on the larger category of business method patents generally and tax strategy patents specifically.</p>
<p>The opinion of the Court was written by Justice Kennedy and joined by the four justices on the right&#8211;Alito, Roberts, Thomas and Scalia.   The opinion agreed that the Federal Circuit&#8217;s &#8220;machine-or-transformation&#8221; test was a valuable clue to the question of process patents eligibility, but rejected the Federal Circuit&#8217;s conclusion that it was the exclusive test for process patents.  The statutory analysis in the opinion was the kind of stretched, &#8220;ordinary meaning&#8221; dictionary and common usage based interpretation that becomes absurd quickly in the context of a highly technical statute such as the Patent Act.  Consistent application of that everyday definition of process would allow patenting of almost any novel human activity, including a series of steps to implement a tax planning strategy.  Further, the opinion treats a remedies provision (enacted in the wake of the State Street Bank case to protect those who might be accuse of infringing this new cateogry of business method patents approved by the court) as an amendment of the key patentability categories language rather than as the stopgap measure it was clearly intended to be  because of the Federal Court&#8217;s condoning of business method patents.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The Court concluded that the hedging claim at issue was unpatentable under its exceptions for abstract ideas (not found directly in the statute, but claimed (awkwardly) to be consistent with the statute&#8217;s &#8220;new and useful&#8221; language).  This is the place where the Court could have shed considerable light on patentability, since it is very unclear from prior precedent just how far the &#8220;abstract idea&#8221; exception extends.  But instead, this opinion created even more confusion.  While hedging in itself is an abstract idea, the application of a hedging algorithm to a particular commodity is not necessarily.  So it seems that there is something beyond mere abstract idea operating here, but the Court was either reluctant or unable to put its fingers on what it was.  </p>
<p>Interestingly, while it rejected the Federal Circuit&#8217;s machine-or-transformation test as the sole basis for deciding process claims, it nonetheless encouraged the court to develop additional definitive criteria that would help narrow down the kinds of process claims that are patentable.  There is a good bit of language in the Court&#8217;s opinion, in fact, that suggests that process claims should not be interpreted overly broadly, even though the patent law generally has been viewed as having wide scope.  The Court makes clear that the remedies provision in section 273 does not istelf suggest a broad reading of business method patentability.  The Court indicates as well that process claims require a test with a higher hurdle to prevent inappropriate claims from being treated as patentable, else the Patent Office would be &#8220;flooded with claims&#8221; that could place a &#8220;chill on creative endeavor&#8221; and literally stifle competition.  It encourages the Federal Circuit to come up with additional ways to define a narrower category of process claims based on the Flook, Benson and Diehr trilogy of cases that outlined the exceptions for &#8220;abstract ideas, laws of nature and physical phenomena&#8221; and yet approved an application of an algorithm in a rubber curing method.  It indicates that nothing in the opinion should be read as an endorsement of the lax State Street Bank test.  Nonetheless, it concludes that &#8220;the Patent Act leaves open the possibility that there are at least some processes that can fairly be described as business methods&#8221; that would be patentable.  In sum, that is weak support for business method patents and tax strategy patents in particular, but it certainly leaves the door open for some business method patents, particularly the computer programs that were the subject of several amicus briefs and, by extension, possibly some tax strategies that are dependent on application by computer.</p>
<p>Scalia, however, did not join in two parts of the opinion that acknowledged the extreme rarity of business method patents until the 1990s under well-established principles, but nevertheless accepted the idea that &#8220;unforeseen innovations&#8221; such as computer programs might need to be treated as patentable in accommodation of &#8220;Information Age&#8221; technologies.  These parts of the opinion are the most supportive of the corporatist position favoring broad scope of business method patentability, but Scalia&#8217;s tendency to rely on originalism makes it hard for him to take this step.  That may be a good sign for those of us who think that business methods should not be patentable, and in particular that patent claims setting forth tax planning strategies for transactions designed to conform to legal requirements should never be patentable.</p>
<p>Stevens wrote a concurring opinion, in which Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Breyer joined.  That opinion relied on statutory analysis and the history of the patent laws to conclude that business methods should not be eligible for patentability as process patents.  The opinion notes the inconsistencies in Kennedy&#8217;s arguments, and the ultimately conclusory holding that the Bilski claim was an unpatentable abstract idea.  It faults the majority opinion for weak statutory analysis, using the history of the British and US patent laws to establish the well-settled principle through the 1980s that business methods were not patentable.</p>
<p>Breyer also wrote a separate concurrence, claiming to set forth the agreed views of all members of the Court that may not be obvious from the multiplicity of opinions, as follows:</p>
<p>Section 101 has broad scope, but it is limited by the three judicially created exceptions (laws of nature, physical phenomena, abstract ideas ); <br />The machine-or-transformation test is a critical clue to patentable processes; <br />The machine-or-transformation test is not the sole test for process claims, but broadly speaking, process claims must be consistent with the function that the patent laws are designed to protect; <br />The fact that the machine-or-transformation test is not the exclusive test for patentability does not mean that State Street Bank applies&#8211;the test in that case (which approved business method patents generally) led to &#8220;truly absurd&#8221; patent grants; <br />Breyer concluded that the Court means neither to &#8220;deemphasize&#8221; the machine-or-transformation test&#8217;s usefulness nor to suggest that many patentable processes lie beyond its reach.</p>
<p>The dissolution of the majority on the question of an expanded view of process patentability in light of &#8220;Information Age&#8221; technologies suggests that the Court might well reject tax strategy patents except perhaps in the cases where they are clearly interrelated with computer applications that cannot be treated as &#8220;mere post-solution activity.&#8221;  In effect, this leaves the issue even more in limbo than before.  The machine-or-transformation test appeared to have loopholes that would allow computerized applications of tax strategies to be patentable, and the opinion of the Court appears to support that possibility.  Scalia&#8217;s refusal to join the sections on Information Age technologies, however, pushes back against easy acceptance of patents based on legal strategies.  And certainly the four justices in the minority would not find tax strategy claims eligible for patentability.  This was the last case in which Justice Stevens will participate, so there is also the uncertainty of the new Justice&#8217;s approach to these issues and ability to persuade others on the Court to his or her opinion.</p>
<p>The AICPA, which has spearheaded the tax practitioner and accountant community&#8217;s lobbying against tax strategy patents, issued a release on Monday that noted the continuing uncertainty about patentability of tax strategies.  It called on Congress to enact a clear ban to resolve the issue once and for all.  AICPA Renews Call for Congressional Action to Ban Tax Patents, PRNewswire, June 28, 2010.  </p>
<p>Congress should act, but one suspects that the health and financial battles make enactment of the major Patent Reform Bill practically untenable for now.  That means that the most likely possibility for a ban on tax strategy patents would be through a dedicated bill dealing solely with that issue.  But you can bet that the IP bar will fight such a bill tooth and nail, as a toe in the door towards narrowing of patent law (and their turf), under the banner of &#8220;innovation&#8221; and &#8220;public disclosure.&#8221;  Innovation is not an inherent good in finance or tax, and there is little merit to the public disclosure of tax strategies for helping people avoid even more taxes than they already do.  Meantime, we will remain in suspense as the Patent Office and Federal Circuit work through the Supreme Court&#8217;s opinion.</p>

<p><strong>A Caveat, Walter Dellinger</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>“In Skilling (ably explained by Paul&#8217;s posting), my law firm colleagues pressed the argument that the statutory crime of denying anyone of the &#8220;intangible right of honest services&#8221; was unconstitutionally vague unless it was sharply limited to bribery and kickbacks. Given that the honest-services statute had been the basis of hundreds of prosecutions that had been upheld in every federal court of appeals, it may have seemed an unlikely gambit to challenge its constitutionality at this late date. The fact that all nine justices agreed that this long-standing and frequently invoked law was unconstitutionally vague suggests once again that litigants should not take law &#8220;settled&#8221; by court of appeals as a given.”</p></blockquote>
<p>—Walter Dellinger,* writing in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2257937/entry/2258296/">Slate</a></p>
<p>Well, no, with due respect to Walter Dellinger—and a great deal of respect is due here; this post and his others thus far are outstanding in their analysis not just of the narrow substantive issue that the Court decided in the cases he’s discussing, but also in their underlying indications— the fact that all nine justices agreed that this long-standing and frequently invoked law was unconstitutionally vague suggests once again that litigants who fall within one of the privileged classes of parties whose petitions to the Court will be given actual consideration by the justices should not take law &#8220;settled&#8221; by court of appeals as a given.” </p>
<p>The Skilling case and the related Black and Weyrauch cases decided in concert, all of them challenging as unconstitutionally vague the “honest services” statute, illustrate, as does another high-profile opinion the Court issued within the last two weeks, Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc. v. Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection, that these justices will look the other way for many years (some of the justices, for decades), rejecting one after another after another request that the Court consider a challenge to the constitutionality of, or a challenge to a lower federal courts’ interpretation of, some statute or court-created procedural or jurisdictional “doctrine” (e.g., a court-created rule that determines whether the federal courts have “subject-matter jurisdiction” to hear the case at all), until some zillionaire CEO or some Fortune 100 corporation or some group or individual challenging as unconstitutional some government-caused diminishment of the value of their property or some other government action opposed by the Republican Party’s base. </p>
<p>Or at least until some other private litigant has the sophistication and financial wherewithal to hire a member of the elite group of regular Supreme Court litigators. Or until some government or government official or employee asks the Court to consider the issue.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />In a remarkable admission five years ago in an opinion written by Justice Ginsburg in a case called Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., the Court actually conceded that a subject-matter jurisdictional doctrine known as the Rooker-Feldman doctrine, created by the Court in 1983, had been routinely and profoundly misinterpreted by the lower federal courts for more than two decades. That Court-created doctrine impliedly inserted a word—the word “only”—into a particular jurisdictional statute, 28 U. S. C. §1257, so that, with that word inserted, the statute removed from the lower federal courts the authority to hear cases that challenged the constitutionality of state-court procedures or interpretations of state laws and policies. </p>
<p>Until last week, that is. The opinion five years ago in Exxon Mobil Corp. limited the use of the doctrine only to the extent necessary for Exxon Mobil to win. No matter that that particular limitation on the use of the doctrine was nonsensical. The limitation was that the lower federal courts indeed could consider such cases as long as the case was not completely over in the state courts, including in the appellate courts, at the time that the federal lawsuit was filed. Exxon Mobil’s case was still pending in the state courts, so—voila!—the federal courts could (no, make that, must) hear Exxon Mobil’s federal lawsuit. That ruling enabled the lower federal courts to continue to refuse to hear such lawsuits except in cases that were still pending at some level in the state-court system. </p>
<p>Until this month, that is. Actually, first, on June 1, the Court issued a majority opinion by Justice Ginsburg in a case called Levin, Tax Commissioner of Ohio v. Commerce Energy, Inc., holding that in the particular type of case—cases in which a party is challenging the constitutionality of a particular state tax—the party must first litigate that issue to its full conclusion in, um, state court. The case subtlely killed Rooker-Feldman in its Exxon Mobil reincarnation. But the opinion didn’t mention Rooker-Feldman. </p>
<p>Three weeks later, in Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc., though—much to my surprise—it did. In an opinion by Justice Scalia, who referred derisively to Rooker-Feldman (to his credit, not for the first time during his tenure on the Court) as “the so-called Rooker-Feldman doctrine), the Court overturned the doctrine in total. The Scalia opinion doesn’t actually say that that is what the Court was doing, opting instead to say that the doctrine is not after all a subject-matter-jurisdiction doctrine but is just a reiteration of another legal doctrine called the doctrine of res judicata. The doctrine of res judicata is one that predates the Rooker-Feldman doctrine by roughly two hundred years. It bars litigants from re-litigating issues or claims that they lost on in earlier litigation—but its application is unequivocally limited by four specific requirements of constitutional due process of law. </p>
<p>Justice Stevens, incidentally (or maybe not incidentally), is a longtime, vociferous critic of Rooker-Feldman, and has advocated its demise. </p>
<p>Because this particular case challenged the constitutionality of what the petitioners to the Court called a “judicial taking” via a state court’s ruling in their case, and because these litigants had filed their Fifth Amendment “property takings” challenge in the lower federal courts after the state-court case was completed, the Court needed to effectively kill the Rooker-Feldman doctrine in all its incarnations in order to hear the case. </p>
<p>I wrote a few months ago on Slate&#8217;s &#8220;The Fray&#8221; discussion board that the Court would decide the case on the merits of the substantive constitutional issue, but I doubted that the Court would even mention Rooker-Feldman. I expected the justices to silently treat this as a one-case instance. So I’m surprised. And deeply gratified. </p>
<p>This is, of course, not to say that the lower federal courts will stop invoking Rooker-Feldman to dismiss lawsuits that challenge the constitutionality of state-court procedures or state-court rulings. But it is to say that next time some CEO, mega-corporation, or group or individual challenging the constitutionality of some state-court ruling that offends the Republican base, the Court may actually finally expressly say that it is killing Rooker-Feldman.

<p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit last month enjoined a Pennsylvania county prosecutor’s office from indicting teenage girls who had sued in federal court because their county’s prosecutor was threatening “sexting” indictments unless the girls agreed to attend a months-long class devised by the prosecutor to educate the girls about the prosecutor’s sense of sexual morality for teen girls. The case is Miller v. Mitchell. </p>
<p>The court’s opinion gained widespread attention in legal circles. And not only because it concerned the hot topic of teen sexting. The ruling was based, surprisingly, not on grounds specific to sexting but instead on the prosecutor’s interference with what the court said was the kids’ parents’ constitutional right to decide, free of state interference, what “ideas of morality and gender roles” their children will be taught. And on what the basis that the prosecutor’s indoctrination-by-extortion plan violated what the court said was the kids’ free speech rights to not be compelled by the state to write a mea culpa essay in conformance with the prosecutor&#8217;s sense of morality. </p>
<p>The opinion is being hailed as a civil rights victory. And it is a civil rights victory, but not just for the obvious reasons. Other civil rights advocates thought, “This is a big free-speech victory.&#8221; And, “This is a big parents’-rights victory.” Me? I thought, “This sets a blueprint for avoidance of the Younger doctrine.”</p>
<p>The Younger doctrine?</p>
<p>The Supreme Court regularly engages in the extracurricular activity of proclaiming court-created ‘doctrines’ that undermine the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the statute that is the main federal statute that provides for access to federal court in order to challenge the constitutionality of a federal, state or local law or government policy, or an action of a particular government official or employee. </p>
<p>One of those court-created doctrines is the “Younger abstention doctrine,” named for a 1971 Supreme Court opinion called Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37(1971), the case in which the doctrine originated. The essence of that doctrine originally was that, in the name of neo-federalist comity toward states, federal courts are required to “abstain” from hearing any civil rights claims brought by a person who is currently being prosecuted for a matter arising from that claim. The Supreme Court later expanded the doctrine to require the lower federal courts to abstain from hearing constitutional challenges to a state court’s procedural or substantive handling of civil cases during the pendency of the case in state court. The doctrine does have a few eye-of-the-judicial-beholder exceptions, which are rarely invoked.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />The companion court-created Rooker-Feldman doctrine is (erroneously) interpreted by the lower federal courts to prohibit them from hearing such constitutional claims in civil lawsuits once the state-court case is over, ostensibly for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. (Rooker-Feldman will be the subject of a later article.) Habeas corpus law does allow challenges to the constitutionality of state-court criminal proceedings once the state-court appellate process is completed, but the two doctrines combine to effectively remove constitutional restraints from the judicial branches of state governments in civil cases. </p>
<p>The Supreme Court has never explained why it believes that these types of court-created federalist comity should apply to state judicial branches but not to the other two branches of state government. But I suspect it is a matter of professional courtesy. Or a matter of what they think they can get away with without dismay from the public. The very purpose of this jurisprudential “federalism” ideology is to flip the meaning of the Constitution’s Supremacy clause. </p>
<p>Justice Clarence Thomas, a professed originalist/textualist, speaks, for example, eloquently about what he and other federalists call the “dignity” of the states as sovereigns that will suffer humiliation by interference from a federal court. The dignity of the states trumps the dignity of the individual. Unless some specific right dear to his particular heart is at issue. Think Second Amendment. Or Fifth Amendment’s “takings” rights. </p>
<p>The kids who along with their parents sued in Miller were lucky. Had they waited until an indictment was issued, they could not have challenged the constitutionality of the criminal statute as it was being applied to them, and they could not have challenged the constitutionality of the prosecutor’s conduct, however bizarre and clearly violative of constitutional rights. The Younger doctrine would have prevented it. They would have had to endure a full prosecution and, if convicted, years of appeals, and if necessary, the years-long federal habeas process, in order to test in federal court the constitutionality of the prosecutor’s actions. Instead, because they filed their lawsuit before any indictment was issued, the legal process for them ended swiftly with a federal-court-issued temporary restraining order. </p>
<p>The moral of this story is that individuals who are in danger of prosecution under a statute they wish to challenge as unconstitutional, or who want to contest the constitutionality of the prosecutor’s conduct of the investigation, have a blueprint for avoiding the Younger doctrine: they can file their lawsuit under § 1983 before the indictment is filed in state court. </p>
<p>In civil (non-criminal) matters, though, the dignity of the states will have to rest upon the continued evisceration of § 1983 and the Supremacy Clause.</p>

<blockquote><p>“It saddens me to think that it took Justice Souter 19 years of heavy constitutional lifting and departure from the court before he could turn to the American people and explain clearly that much as we might want judging to be easy, it never can be.”—Dahlia Lithwick, in <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2256458/" target="_blank">Slate</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Well, actually, these days judging has become exquisitely easy—unless, that is, the particular case, say, pits two large corporations, each of them represented by a high-profile, big-name lawyer, usually a partner at a mega law firm. Or pits the prosecutor’s office against some former CEO or CFO who is represented by a big-name lawyer, usually a partner at a mega law firm. Then, the judge, judges or justices must actually judge—as that word, used as a verb, is billed in middle school civics class and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Otherwise, judging is now simply a formula, one that has nothing to do with a fair reading of the Constitution or of statutes but that has absolutely everything to do with docket-clearing and with aggressively limiting access to court, at least to challenge the constitutionality of a statute, government policy or government act, by someone who is not claiming a Fifth Amendment “takings” violation, religious discrimination, “reverse discrimination, or violation of the Second Amendment right to bear arms—virtually the only constitutional rights that, according to the chief justice and colleagues Scalia, Thomas, and Alito believe trump states’ (and local governments’) rights to violate the constitutional rights of individuals.</p>
<p>An origianlist/textualist interpretation of the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause seems to work well for litigants who invoke the constitutional rights at issue in those cases, but only ever so rarely for those who invoke any of the other constitutional rights that accrue to individuals—or that a textualist reading of the relevant parts of the Constitution would seem to suggest, but that apparently do not.</p>
<p>For people invoking those rights, there will always be some procedural flaw—in the way the lawsuit’s complaint was drafted; in legal “standing” to bring the case, or in some other “subject matter” jurisdictional or quasi-jurisdictional respect; or by virtue (so to speak) of the ever-metastasizing doctrines of sovereign immunity and “qualified” immunity. Or in whatever. The stated grounds are just formality, and fungible.</p>
<p>So, no, Justice Souter. And, no, Dahlia. While it’s true that judging never should be easy, these days it almost always is. I mean, how hard is it, really, to look at whom the plaintiff is; whom his, her or its lawyer is, or whether or not the plaintiff even has a lawyer (self-representation being a crime inevitably punishable not just by dismissal of the lawsuit but by defamatory and demeaning diatribe); and to look at whether the case presents an opportunity to further Republican Party interests?</p>
<p>Not very. </p></div>

<blockquote><p>Ever since Gore v Bush it has become apparent that the US Supreme Court has taken it upon themselves to occasionally decide the outcome of US elections. Yesterday they demonstrated this ability again when they decided to block funding for three of the top four candidates for Arizona governor. This means these three gubernatorial candidates will not be getting their anticipated $1.4 million in public matching funds beginning in two weeks.</p>
<p>Two weeks! Our Supreme Court justices have given these three candidates two weeks to find alternative funding that would have otherwise been available through the Arizona Citizens Clean Elections Act that has been in existence for twelve years.</p>
<p>As I wrote earlier, the Clean Elections Act “corrected the AzScam problems that made a mockery of the Arizona election process. The corporatist cronies who were the big losers when this law passed have been fighting to overturn (or weaken) it ever since.”</p>
<p>Yesterday they succeeded &#8211; thanks to the US Supreme Court.</p>
<p>The Roberts court chose to delay looking at the matter until their next session, meaning no decision will be made on whether they even intend to hear the Clean Elections appeal until after the election. But they did agree to block the existing CLEAN ELECTIONS procedures which have been IN PLACE FOR TWELVE YEARS anyway.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is a quick e-mail back from Beverly Mann, <a target="_blank" href="http://annarborist.blogspot.com/">The Annarborist</a> and sometime guest on constitutional issues at Angry Bear on this topic:</p>
<blockquote><p>I think the Fab Five on the Court are playing with major fire here. The First Amendment argument is one that most people, including those who oppose campaign finance laws, will recognize as ridiculous: that the law unconstitutionally limits the free speech of the privately funded candidates because the privately funded candidates are “forced” to limit their own their spending in order to avoid triggering the provision that will entitle their opponents to more public money.</p>
<p>Some commentator, I can’t recall who, described this aptly as pretzel logic. As the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the law, said, the non-public-funded candidates really are arguing not that their own speech is limited but that the law gives their opponents access to the same right of speech that they—the non-public-funded candidates—have.</p>
<p>Most people will recognize that this law does not limit the free speech of the non-public-funded candidates.</p>

<p><strong>A Gap Not In Time But In Judicial Veracity</strong><br />crossposted with <a target="_blank" href="http://annarborist.blogspot.com/">The Annarborist</a></p>
<p>“Talk of judicial activism tends to focus on results, but the Guggenheim case shows that maybe we should talk a little bit more about method.”<br />—Doug Kendall and Elizabeth Wydra, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2255451/">“Torturing the Law: Jay Bybee models conservative judicial activism in the 9th Circuit</a>,” by Doug Kendall and Elizabeth Wydra, in <em>Slate</em></p>
<p>Ooh, yeah! Or, more precisely,“Finally!”</p>
<p>Bybee, as those who follow national legal-political issues know, is the former Bush administration assistant attorney general who as head of the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel—the office charges with giving administration officials straight analysis of the law—co-authored, along with the infamous John Yoo, a legal memorandum that pronounced legal under United States and international law interrogation techniques used on terrorist suspects captured oversees that almost everyone familiar with relevant federal and international law believe constituted illegal torture.</p>
<p>The Bush administration eventually withdrew that memorandum, and Bybee is reported to have confided to friends that he regrets having signed that memo, which actually was written mostly by Yoo.  Before the memo came to light, Bybee was nominated and confirmed for a seat of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, the court that had federal appellate jurisdiction over cases from the three West Coast states, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Alaska, Hawaii and Guam. </p>
<p>In the Guggenheim case—specifically, Guggenheim v. City of Goleta—Bybee has, as Kendall and Wydra put it so succinctly, “managed to do what has eluded national property-rights advocates for decades: declare a rent control ordinance unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment&#8217;s Takings Clause.”  And as the quote I chose to highlight at the opening of this piece, talk of judicial activism does tend to focus on results, but the Guggenheim case shows that maybe we should talk a little bit more about method, because it really is method—what lawyers know as procedural law—that the rightwing legal community, most significantly those on the Supreme Court and the lower federal courts—have used regularly to achieve the substantive results that want. </p>
<p>I recognized eons ago that the rightwing legal movement—i.e., the Federalist Society, including their large judicial contingent—has been using court-fabricated pleading, jurisdictional, quasi-jurisdictional, sovereign immunity (mainly a bizarre rewriting of the actual text of the Eleventh Amendment), and “qualified immunity” doctrines to quietly recreate constitutional and other federal procedural law in the image of the Republic Party’s political and ideological bases. But until now it seemed that a few law professors and I were the only ones did.  So it’s really, really nice to finally see an article published on a widely-read media website that points out this concerted rightwing judicial strategy and calls that spade the spade that it is. </p>
<p>The political right has had a nearly three-decade-long free ride, because the general news media limits its reporting and discussion of legal issues and court opinions—including Supreme Court opinions—to hot-button culture wars issues and to court opinions decided on what lawyers call the “merits,” a legal term of art that means that the case was decided on the substantive issue that the case was about. <br /><a name="more"></a><br />Usually, these procedural gimmicks are used to defeat access to a court decision on the merits when the party who filed the lawsuit is invoking a constitutional or federal statutory right favored by the ideological progressives. But, as Kendall and Wydra explain, last week, “Jay Bybee is a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit, but apparently being elevated to the federal bench hasn&#8217;t stunted his creative powers. In a case called Guggenheim v. City of Goleta, Bybee has managed to do what has eluded national property-rights advocates for decades: declare a rent control ordinance unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment&#8217;s Takings Clause.”</p>
<p>And, as the Slate article authors illustrate, he did it by creating fictions of both law and fact.  The Guggenheims had bought a mobile home park in 1997 that was subject to mobile home rent control laws enacted in 1979 and amended in 1987.  The purchase price reflected the reduced value of the property because of the reduced rental profits resulting from the rent control plan.  The mobile park was located in what at the time was an unincorporated part Santa Barbara County, but which in 2002 became incorporated as the city of Goleta.  By state law, as part of the incorporation process, the new city’s charter provided that all existing laws pertaining to that area under Santa Barbara County law would become city ordinances at the moment of incorporation as the city of Goleta, and the effect of all those laws would “relate back” so that they had the same effect as they had, pre-incorporation.</p>
<p>The Guggenheims sued, claiming that the rent-control law violated the Fifth Amendment’s bar to a government “taking” of private property with just compensation.  For decades now, the rightwing “property rights” folks—most of whom normally consider the filing of lawsuits anathema to the very concept of freedom (although they never explain why, exactly), and who sing the praises of states’ (and local governments’) rights to violate the constitutional rights of individuals, all the while styling themselves libertarians—have filed federal lawsuit upon federal lawsuit alleging that regulations such as zoning laws and environmental laws violate their Fifth Amendment rights under that Amendment’s “takings” clause because the regulations diminish the value of their real estate.  It is, the claim, a “regulatory taking” without just compensation.  </p>
<p>They have rarely succeeded in getting a favorable ruling on the “merits”—that is, on the substantive legal issue—and have never before been able to get a ruling holding that rent-control regulations constitute an unconstitutional “taking” under the Fifth Amendment.</p>
<p>As a June 3 article in the New York Times discussed, current Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan, back in 1987 when she was a clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall, wrote an angry memorandum urging her boss to try to overturn a conservative appeals court ruling that had questioned the constitutionality of a rent-control ordinance.”  Kagan said that the appeals court judge who wrote the opinion “has flouted the opinions of this court and has reached a result that is sweeping in its implications. Although the decision does not invalidate the ordinance on its merits, it is an authorization for broad, wholesale attacks on rent-control regulation.”  The Supreme Court refused to hear the case, allowing the ruling to stand, not on the merits”—not on the Fifth Amendment issue but instead on the basis of some procedural gimmick. </p>
<p>That has been par for the course.  Court-fabricated procedural/jurisdictional/quasi-jurisdictional/soveright-immmunity/“qualified”-immunity gimmicks routinely bar people from access to court in order to vindicate individual constitutional rights—including challenging the constitutional of laws and government policies—that liberals value.  And those procedural gimmicks are ignored, or new ones created ad hoc, in order to allow access to court by those who claim violations of individual constitutional rights that conservatives hold dear.</p>
<p>But in the Guggenheim case, Bybee fabricated, first, a legal fiction and then a fact in order to pronounce this rent-control law and, inferentially, all rent-control laws, because there was nothing unusual about this particular one, violative of the “takings” clause.  Bybee fabricated the legal fiction that there was a momentary gap in time when the ordinance did not apply: that moment when the land ceased to be part of unincorporated Santa Barbara County and before it was a newly-incorporated city-and that therefore the city ordinance was a new ordinance.  This, Bybee said, enabled the Guggenheims to avoid the statute-of-limitations bar to their challenging the initial ordinance more than two years after they bought the property. </p>
<p>And, allowing the Guggenheims to proceed with the lawsuit and obtain a ruling on the “merits,” Bybee fabricated a fact.  Bybee claimed that the Guggenheims had, as a matter of fact, seen a diminishment of the value of their property since they purchased it; without a diminishment in value since they bought the property, there would, after all, be no “taking,” as a matter of fact, irrespective of the law.  As Judge Andrew Kleinfeld, a conservative Reagan appointee, said in his dissent, the price the Guggenheims paid for the property in 1997 reflected the diminished value due to the rent-control ordinance.  </p>
<p>The Guggenheims were claiming not a diminishment but the inability to reap a windfall from an end to the ordinance.  They were, Bybee said, entitled to something that few others these days are entitled to: a ruling on the merits of their challenge to the constitutionality of a law or government policy or action. They were, Bybee said, entitled to a ruling on whether they were entitled to something not that they had lost but instead that they never had—a property whose value was based in part on an absence of an applicable rent-control regulation—because they were entitled to a ruling on the substantive constitutional issue of whether rent-control regulations violate the property owners’ rights under the Fifth Amendment’s “takings” clause.</p>
<p>And we all know that it does.  Even if none other than self-styled constitutional originalist and textualist Antonin Scalia has said that the Framers had in mind only actual physical takings of property, not the diminishment of the value of the property through regulation. And Kendall and Wydra quote Scalia as having said exactly that.  </p>
<p>Judicial activism, like beauty, is in the eye of the judicial beholder.  As is access to court in order to have constitutional challenges decided on the merits.</p>

                                <p>No wonder Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/chris-edley-on.html">has had no luck persuading Christopher Edley to get rid of the malfeasant John Yoo</a>.  As <a href="http://www.dailyhowler.com/dh051710.html">Bob Somersby observes</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Christopher Edley thinks he’s one of your “betters.” It’s hard to believe, but that’s the exceptionally low-IQ framework this self-proclaimed member of the elite enunciated in Sunday’s piece. According to Edley, rubes like us should want our “betters” in important posts, like the post in which Kagan will serve:<br />
<blockquote>EDLEY: The tension between elitism and populism is embedded in our national DNA because America rejected the model of a monarch ruling by divine right in favor of an iffy experiment in democratic self-governance. So now you are responsible for choosing your leader. Do you want someone like you or someone better than you?</p></blockquote>
<p>What an astonishing framework! But so it goes when people like Edley spends decades inside institutions like Harvard, convincing themselves that they and their peers are “better” than all the rest of us rubes. [formatting in original]</p></blockquote>
<p>Kagan, like Yoo, &#8220;has excelled in a meritocratic system, one that is selective yet far more open than in generations past.&#8221;</p>
<p>Bonus quote from Edley:<br />
<blockquote>The gatekeeper power of such institutions is why it was so important to desegregate them (using affirmative action, among other tools) and why virtually all leaders of great universities talk about diversity and access.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yep.  Elena Kagan is All About Diversity.</p>
<p>At least <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/04/scott-horton-on.html">Edley is consistent</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Dean Edley rolls embarrassingly off the tracks.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>For this post I will formally introduce myself. I am Daniel J. Becker. It is only proper and just to do so. I am using Mr. Greenwalds discussion only as a platform to add my thoughts regarding the Citizens United decision.  Also this is a long read. So I&#8217;ll give you up front the crib note version: The source of error and thus argument is that the arguing/arguments are starting in the middle of the line of reasoning and not at the beginning.</p>
<blockquote><p>The &#8220;rule of law&#8221; means we faithfully apply it in ways that produce outcomes we like and outcomes we don&#8217;t like. </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/01/22/citizens_united/index.html">The above is</a>, I believe, the thrust of Mr. Greenwald&#8217;s argument. It has always been his strength and the source of the pleasure I receive when I read his arguments. I do not disagree with his statement. I believe it is the same argument presented by Mr. Jonathan Turley on MSNBC and by the ACLU. Mr. Turley <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3036677//vp/34984956#34984956">specifically states</a> that the Constitution does not protect us from bad decisions. </p>
<p>Our predicament with this latest decision and the examples of Bush et al&#8217;s “warrantless eavesdropping, torture, unilateral Presidential programs” which Mr. Greenwald presents is not found in the argument of whether we like or dislike the outcome. The argument however is addressing an issue I have had for years with the way law is practiced. </p>
<blockquote><p>What is the proper means of using, applying, implementing a form of governance based on the ideology of “the rule of law”? </p></blockquote>
<p>We need to step back further to see the source that can lead to a dire results upon implementing a ruling of properly applied law. One side is asking “how can you ignore the cliff?” The other is responding with “it&#8217;s the law”. There might even be a third party arguing that both sides can be viewed as just differences of interpretation of the words used. Maybe this even comes down to a simple placing of a comma?  </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>Seems like quite the dilemma for us, no? If we are not true to applying the law as written then we are by definition of “rule of law” no longer under “rule of law” and thus the entire concept of law as we are historically taught becomes instantly nonexistent. </p>
<p>So it appears we are at times left with only the forced acceptance of hurting ourselves, hurting our social order for the ideal of living by the rule of law, an ideal existing for the purpose of removing the errors of emotion in the attempt to achieve betterment in producing justice.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry. I will not accept that a system designed by persons who devoted their lives to understanding human nature and history, and used civil war to create the environment needed such that their ideas regarding government could live, is inherently flawed in a manor that we have to live with the threat of what can be called &#8220;legal masochism&#8221;. The question becomes: Where is the flaw in the application of the ideal and concept of “the rule of law” such that we have a masochistic results? Even Mr. Turley notes that this current decision has the ability to be a major self flagellation.</p>
<p>The only point at which both sides or all sides can resolve this predicament (assuming you are not accepting that legal masochism is an inherent aspect of our system) is at the place in any sentence where the word “faith” or it&#8217;s variant appears. Faithfully. Faithful. This word “faith” can not be interpreted and thus the sentence understood without answering the question: Given to what? What is our faith given to? What is the basis of our faith? We give faith to something because we accept that the &#8220;something&#8221; has a power of some nature. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.supremecourtus.gov/about/textoftheoathsofoffice2009.pdf">SCOTUS</a>: &#8230;and that I will <strong>faithfully</strong> and impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent upon me as _________, according to the best of my abilities and understanding, agreeably to the constitution and laws of the United States.</p>

<p>The only entity in our governing system not to specifically or tangentially pledge their faith to the Constitution is “We the People”. The Pledge of Allegiance is a pledge to each other as one. I would argue, that such a pledge implies our faith in “We the People”. This is as it should be. We are not bound to the Constitution by any external power. Not by religious power, royalty power, dictatorial power, corporate power, etc. We can not be so bound because we are the power. There is no other hierarchical power in our system of governance. Any faith we express regarding our ability to govern our self is the result of the enlightened reality that people governed are the source of all governance power. We are the power. We agreed to this understanding of power in ratifying the Constitution.</p>
<p>Thus, the only power that the Constitution has is the power that We write into it. This is the genius of our founders. The Constitution is the written word so to speak of our power. It is our collective thoughts regarding governance. It is our identity as a governed people. It is the blue print to be used by any entity to come if such entity desired to reproduce our governance mind. </p>
<p>Many have noted the Preamble of the Constitution as a reference to why the Citizens United ruling is in error. The presentation is that it states only “We the People” and thus follows that only humans can have rights and power. But, this is incorrect as to why the argument as Mr. Greenwald and Mr. Turley state is in error. </p>
<p>The Preamble does not give power to us. The Preamble however, is very important for it is the statement from us to each other declaring what &#8220;We the people&#8221; will do with our power. The Preamble is the point of source and reference for all of our laws and the Bill of Rights and thus rulings. The Preamble is the stated purpose and desired goal of the application of our power. It is the final test as to the consistency of all that comes after it. All that comes after the Preamble is the listed means by which we will exercise our power. This includes the Bill of Rights. As an individual, it would be one&#8217;s purpose in life.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the real rub however, that I have with all I have read and the current way law is practiced and the reason for the above set up of this discussion. I am not a sum of parts and neither are you. I am a whole, a one which can not be understood or related to by subsection analysis. My intentions can not be fully implemented or appreciated as to their appropriateness to my overarching purpose independently of each. If you accept that this is true and I believe that the prevailing founders did, then our Constitution as the written word of our power and it&#8217;s use must so be understood and applied as a whole life which is summarized in the Preamble. </p>
<p>To exercise our Constitution in a reductionist manor, I believe is a mistake and a disservice to the intellect of those who wrote it. Such proof of thought can be found in the very division of our power. No one division can have purpose, can have material to work with without the other. The concept of separate but equal can only be appreciated if it is understood that the separation is only for the purpose of job distinction. Our power can not be exercised in whole by any one branch. The strength of the whole of our power can not be experienced in any one branch. That each branch is originated in the Constitution and each branch is dependent on the others for its job, is proof of construct and thus application and exercise of the Constitution and all that comes after it. One can not properly determine the appropriateness of any decision originating out of any of the branches without considering the the relationship to the whole of the Constitution. The whole being the relationship back to the Preamble which is the stated purpose and intentions of the application of our power. That such work is not performed creates what the Citizens United case has created&#8230;legal masochism. </p>
<p>Yes, we are at the point of faith. &#8220;We the People&#8221; refers to a collective and thus, the collective faith in the source of governance power. Our government exists solely as the result of our collective agreement to have faith in the idea that the power to govern comes from the governed. The entirety of our power is the collective faith in the idea: the power to govern comes from the governed. This was never made more real to me than when the issue of the “Nuclear Option” materialized. I wondered why not just go to the SCOTUS to get the question of constitutionality settled? I learned that the SCOTUS would not consider such a question coming from another equally powerful branch of our governance. Thus, the rule regarding filibusters and in fact the entire functioning of our government as laid out in the Constitution came down to an agreement by two parties (political or otherwise) to abide by the rules . Once one side decides not to agree, all governance related to the purposeful use of our power as stated in the Preamble stops. It is the Civil war at the extreme of disagreement. It includes the decision to not abide by the intention of the use of our power as stated in the Preamble leading to our incapable congress.  That is, filibustering everything.  It is why one party could pass all they wanted with just 50 votes.</p>
<p>There is only one means by which an individual or collection of individuals can decide not to agree as it relates to applying our power as designated in the Constitution. It is by not placing faith in the source of the power of government. Once faith is given to any other power than “We the People”, our government instantly ceases to exist. There is no Constitution, no Constitutional power, no Constitutional declaration of the purpose and use of power without faith in “We the People”. It is in this understanding that the argument as presented by Mr. Greenwald and Mr. Turley and those who present the first three words of the Preamble in counter argument fail.   Placing power of any type in any entity other than &#8220;We the People&#8221; is a displacement  of the faith.  Stating that power comes from any other source than &#8220;We the People&#8221; is a displacement of the faith.  Both makes the Constitution just a bunch of words.</p>
<p>There is a reason those who are charged with acting on our behalf, charged with implementing our intent have to pledge their faith to the Constitution. It is because they are pledging their faith to the source of the power they will exercise: We the People. In pledging to the Constitution, they are pledging to Us. It is this pledge to Us that gives us the ability to judge where their faith lays. The moment power is place in something other than &#8220;We the People&#8221;, our governance as dictated by the Constitution ceases to exist.</p>
<p>This gets us to the freedom of speech issue. Freedom of speech can only be applied to Us because as a declared right within our Constitution, the document that is the materialization of our power, it is a declared means by which We exercise our power. There is no other source of power regarding governance and thus there is no other entity that can have or obtain such power. The right of free speech can not be bestowed to an entity that is not a “people” by virtue of judging it&#8217;s bestowment via the Constitution. To do so is a violation of the pledge of faith to the source of our power. </p>
<p>In the issue of the entity called a corporation, the only true means to give it such power would be through legislation though I would argue that the transference of power properly has to be by constitutional amendment as all issues of seat of power are of the Constitution and not laws created by the legislative branch. Laws can not create power in our governance as it is constructed. At the same time, being that corporations are creations of law, it is impossible to reason that they can have the free exercise of a power which is only sourced from our faith in the idea that the power to govern comes from us. That the SCOTUS in the past has ruled (and this is even questioned) that corporations are proxies for people is a misplace of faith. It is a violation of their oath.</p>
<p>Then again, I could have simply pointed out that to conflate our economic system and its structure and components with our governance system as being a proxy for our governance system is the gravest of insults to our founders.  They certainly understood power and they certainly understood the power of pooled money.</p>
<p>Corporations are properly a part of our economic system. It is a system that is in service to “We the people” for it only exists by virtue of law and not by virtue of the Constitution. It is a system that exists for a very specific and limited purpose; a purpose that does not included being a part of our governmental structure which exists for the purpose of exercising our power. Those structures that exist for the exercise of Our power are only the three branches. But consider the argument that corporation are just a coming together of people to exercise their power? Such a thought is a violation of our Constitution and ultimately our faith because the only means to come together to exercise our power is the direct interaction with our government through our Constitution. It&#8217;s called voting. That is the only means that exists in the Constitution for all those “strict constitutionalists”. </p>
<p>The economic system should properly be viewed as the results of our implementation of laws that protects us during the exercising of our personal freedom, not power. Freedom certainly results in greater power, but we have limited our individual exercise of power via our faith in the collective power such that all are endowed with the freedom of “domestic tranquility” and “the Blessings of Liberty.” One is free not to be screwed by another to be blunt but, one is not free to screw another.</p>
<p>At this point I am willing to accept that what I am suggesting with this entire presentation suggests that we are currently living under many rulings that are actually in error and thus would result in the undoing of a major amount of what we consider settled law. For example, the entity called a corporation should have never been accepted as the proper vehicle, model or structure for people to freely assemble for the purpose of forming a relationship with their government. Free assembly is just that. Assembly free of formal structure. What it means is that those looking to be elected really do need to go one person at a time to get said person&#8217;s vote. What it means is that at the point in the growth of our nation that campaigning became an expense for the candidate, we should have implemented public funding via law, or amended the Constitution to allow another form of assemble for the purpose of funding campaigns. Such a method would be an issue of placing power and certainly relates to the Preamble&#8217;s stated purpose and application of our power: <br />
