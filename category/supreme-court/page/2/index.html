<div>Hi Bev, </p>
<p>I have read about this case. Still unclear even after reading your piece as to what the law was for, to do and how the new interpretation changes it. Would love some more expansion on it.</p>
<p>With that, I wonder if it will really matter if that Trans Pacific Partnership goes through.

<div>Hi, Dan.  In my opinion, the biggest problem with most mainstream-media coverage of the Supreme Court is that they mainly cover only Supreme Court decisions that address what lawyers call “substantive” issues—the stuff that actually addresses bottom-line issues that most people think of as what the Supreme Court decides, such as whether something violates the First Amendment or the Fourth Amendment (e.g., search-and-seizure).  But a huge, huge part of what the Supreme Court does is decide “procedural” issues, especially “jurisdictional” issues (which make up a huge, huge part of “procedural” issues—and those issues concern the threshold question of who has access to court, and under what circumstances.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Reagan-era rightwing legal types—federal judges appointed in the 1980s and people like John Roberts and Samuel Alito, who worked as political appointees in the Reagan Justice Dept., and others who “came of age” during that period—have engaged in a decades-long, extremely effective crusade to turn federal law into mainly procedural/jurisdictional law, and to do so in a way that, in effect, lets judges interpret these procedural/jurisdictional (and, closely related to jurisdictional, “immunity”-from-liability) law to bar nearly all constitutional civil rights cases, and many other types of cases, that the ideological right disfavors on <i>substantive</i> grounds, while finding no such procedural/jurisdictional bars when the issue is, say, property “takings” rights or one of the other two or three type of constitutional rights favored by the right. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas are at the very forefront of this type of thing.  Kennedy’s views on this are truly bizarre and utterly unfounded in any reasonable interpretation of American law since the Fourteenth Amendment became part of the Constitution.  He believes that state courts, unlike the two other branches of state government—the executive and legislative branches—are free to ignore constitutional rights, because otherwise the federal government (the federal courts) would be undermining “federalism” and thus the “dignity” of the states as “sovereigns.”  But he never explains why he recognizes that the two other branches of state government have no such exemptions from the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause.  Thomas, by contrast, simply doesn’t recognize the Supremacy Clause at all, except for such things as gun-ownership rights, reverse-discrimination Equal Protection rights, property “takings” rights, and the right to commandeer, say, a public school event to proselytize on evangelical Christianity.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Supremacy Clause is at Article VI, Clause 2.  It says:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof; and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>All that said, the issues in <i>Kiobel</i> [<i>v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co</i>.] concern only the interpretation of a federal court-jurisdiction <i>statute</i>—access to federal court in a personal-injury/property-damage case.  The issues and arguments are so arcane (inside-baseball) that it’s hard to summarize them briefly, mainly because the issues in this go-around at the Court are different that the ones argued there last spring—but that doesn’t mean that the earlier-argued ones won’t ultimately be the issues on which the case is decided. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So, [here’s] a good article on it all, that I think is understandable to lay people.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I also posted a PS to Dan, saying:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I don’t know enough about the specifics of the Trans Pacific Partnership provisions to know whether or not it would affect the application of the Alien Tort Act*, Dan.  It seems to me, from googling the pact, that it could, but I really don’t know.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Basically, what that crowd has done is erect a series of classic violations of the constitutional construct of equal protection of the law.  They’ve done so in two separate ways:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>First, they have effectively closed down the Supreme Court except for a tiny, tiny handful of cases, almost always only when asked by a state or local government, a state or local government official (usually a prosecutor), a crusader on some issue, represented* for free by some rightwing lawyers’ group, or a corporation or very wealthy federal criminal defendant represented by some $1,000 per hr. Supreme Court “specialist.”  </div>
<div></div>
<div>They do this increasingly these days, apparently largely at the behest of Kennedy (at least when a lower court has violated the “sovereign dignity” of a state court in a state criminal case) by acting as a “court of error,” correcting what they claim is legal error by the lower court in contradicting what the good justices say is clear Supreme Court precedent, but by ignoring, year after year, so many other clear instances of lower courts ignoring Supreme Court precedent that it’s downright jaw-dropping, because, after all, they continue to claim, the Supreme Court isn’t a “court of error.”  (Antonin Scalia is especially vocal on this, except, of course, when he decides that it can serve that very purpose.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, second, they have deliberately established such convoluted procedural/jurisdictional rules that those rules are inherently (and, surely, by design) open to whatever interpretation the lower-court judges wish.  And almost always, what they wish is to dismiss lawsuits.  And so that’s what they do.  Most judges, irrespective of which president appointed them, do this these days, simply to lighten their civil case to, roughly, cases filed by large corporations.  (State-court judges caught on to this free-for-all a while back, and do the same.) 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But, as for the Supreme Court, many, many of us who actually follow it closely recognize that it’s become a perverse joke—a non-serious institution that continues to have profoundly serious control over very serious matters.  Sort of like other venerable American institutions—the old, once-venerable Wall Street brokerage firms, for example—that have been commandeered, morally, by the ideological right in the last three decades.  With similar results.

<div>SECOND UPDATE:<a href="http://eenews.net/public/Greenwire/2012/09/28/2">Here’s</a> a good discussion of the “law of nations” language in the Alien Tort Statute*, and why, at least in the opinion of environmentalists, <i>that</i>—i.e., this <i>substantive</i> issue—rather than the procedural issues that the conservatives raise, is what <i>Kiobel</i> <i>should</i> be about.  The Court will address this substantive issue only if it rules against the oil company on the jurisdictional issues—are foreign corporations “aliens” within the meaning of the statute, and if so, does the statute limit its reach to cases with ties to the United States?  It seems really unlikely that it will decide that the statute applies to conduct untied to the United States—even though drawing that conclusion requires—horrors!—looking beyond the text of the statute to legislative history. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which, as luck would have it, is perfectly appropriate if that’s what it takes to rule in favor of an oil company and other mega-corporations.
</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*Correction, Oct. 2: The statute is known by two names: The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) and the Alien Tort Claims  Act (ATCA). </div>

                                <p>
<div>Well, it’s that time of year again—when the Supreme Court justices <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2012/08/supreme_court_s_recess_can_we_afford_to_have_the_nine_justices_spend_three_months_on_vacation_.html">interrupt their primary careers of flitting</a> around the world (some of them), or at least around the country (the remainder of them), to teach a law school course or two, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/01/justice-ruth-bader-ginsburg-egypt_n_1248527.html">to instruct high court justices in other countries on how to feign working full-time</a>, and to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/18/us/clarence-thomas-discusses-his-life-and-the-supreme-court.html?_r=0">reassure us all yet again</a> that they’re all great friends. With one another.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That last one is not least.  It is instead a perennial, and a great relief to those of us who care more about the justices’ working conditions during their occasional-days job than with, say, the fact that as a practical matter,<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-mcelroy/book-review-in-law-man-sh_b_1893054.html"> we really have no Supreme Court</a>.  Which we don’t, except for the 68-or-so <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/09/scotus-for-law-students-sponsored-by-bloomberg-law-the-courts-shrinking-docket/">occasions each year</a> when they deign to answer the call of duty, usually of a state whose dignity has been affronted by a federal appeals court that has placed some <a href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/11-00465qp.pdf">importance of a constitutional magnitude upon the dignity of an individual</a> [pdf required] who <i>wasn’t</i> complaining of one of infringement upon one of the three or four rights that conservatives privilege over the right of states to violate them, or by a corporation that otherwise would have to deal with a class action lawsuit.  Or by the group Citizens United.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So … no more<a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/09/scotus-for-law-students-sponsored-by-bloomberg-law-the-courts-shrinking-docket/#more-152737"> tips to law students to stay upbeat and focused</a>.  Not from the leading expert on such matters, anyway.  And no more <a href="http://www.annarbor.com/news/supreme-court-justice-elena-kagan-discusses-the-serious-and-not-so-serious-workings-of-the-high-cour/">sycophantic predictions of the horrors</a> that would befall society if cameras were allowed at the Court&#8217;s arguments and the news media selected only short clips of Antonin Scalia’s snideness or Anthony Kennedy’s state-courts-but-not-state-executive-or-legislative-branches-are-entitled-to-flip-the-Supremacy-Clause-in-order-to-save-our-republican-form-of-government rants.  Not to mention in order to save our Republican form of government.  Which the court did not, in an actual oral argument, anyway, opting instead for a summary order rather than full briefing and an in-court airing.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>No, sir, no more such helpful insights from the ultimate experts until at least the third week of October, anyway.  They break then, after an exhausting five full—er, five half—days of oral argument and two, count- ’em, two, afternoon conferences, but, unlike other breaks during the winter and spring, only for about 12 days.  During which time, they do read a few of the law clerk “cert. pool” one- or two-paragraph memos recommending a denial of review on virtually every petition filed by a private party who is not represented in the petition by one of the—what? ten, or so?—<a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lisa-mcelroy/book-review-in-law-man-sh_b_1893054.html">de facto-gatekeeper Supreme Court“specialist” lawyers</a>, who by sheer virtue of the fact that they charge about $1,000 an hour and will guarantee that at least one actual justice will read the petition—most certainly are special.  So it’s not as if these folks don’t work during their (many, many) off hours.  (I mean, on Court business! What?  Did you think I meant on writing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Making-Our-Democracy-Work-Judges/dp/0307269914">incessantly banal</a> or <a href="http://www.tnr.com/article/magazine/books-and-arts/106441/scalia-garner-reading-the-law-textual-originalism">downright misleading and deeply self-serving</a> books?)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyway … the justices kick off their term this year with a bang.  Of sorts.  This particular bang was supposed to occur last term, in a case called <em>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Company</em><strong><i>,</i></strong><strong> that will decide whether a statute called the Alien Tort Statute, passed in 1789 to deal with piracy on the high seas, gives our country’s federal courts the authority to hear cases filed by non-Americans against foreign corporations, or foreigners at all, for injury to person or property that occurred outside the United States.  The statute provides that </strong>“[t]he<i> </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_district_court" title="United States district court">district courts</a><i> </i>shall have<i> </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_jurisdiction" title="Original jurisdiction">original jurisdiction</a><i> </i>of any civil action by an<i> </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(law)" title="Alien (law)">alien</a><i> </i>for a<i> </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tort" title="Tort">tort</a><i> </i>only, committed in violation of the<i> </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_international_law" title="Public international law">law of nations</a><i> </i>or a<i> </i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_treaties" title="List of United States treaties">treaty of the United States</a>.”  The case gained a lot of attention last spring when the justices heard oral argument on it, and some of them, but surprisingly not Samuel Alito, indicated that they wanted to rule that “aliens” did not include corporations, irrespective of whether they’re offshore ones or are instead incorporated in, say, Delaware and are therefore people at least for purposes of First Amendment free-speech and free-association rights.   
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But shortly after the oral argument, a majority of the justices decided that Alito, not to mention Mitt Romney, had the better argument.  Corporations should be considered people, my friend, even when that means they can be sued under the Alien Tort Statute*.  At least until Super Pacs funded by these people can put in place enough members of Congress to enact a change to that statute.  Like, to repeal it.  But as it currently exists, the Statute should apply only to corporate people who also are American corporate citizens. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which is what Alito had suggested. The majority, <a href="http://www.callawyer.com/Clstory.cfm?eid=925064&#038;wt.ad=925064%20%7C%20Special%20Preview:%20International%20Human%20Rights%20Cases%20Under%20Fire">egged on by Kennedy from the very outsetof the argument</a>, already had decided that they should rewrite the statute to limit it to actions to which the United States has some association.  “No other nation in the world permits its court to exercise universal civil jurisdiction over alleged extraterritorial human rights abuses to which the nation has no connection,” Kennedy said. The quote was itself a quote, verbatim, from an amicus brief filed by Chevron Corporation.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So … voila!  So much for textualism in judicial interpretation of statutes. The text of this particular statute requires … originalism, the first-line-of-defense fall-back for the likes of Scalia and Clarence Thomas.  Unless, of course, some of those pirates targeted by the statute back in circa 1789 weren’t Americans. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ooops.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Back to plan A?
</p>
<p>&#8212;-<br />*Correction, Oct. 2: The statute is known by two names: The Alien Tort Statute (ATS) and the Alien Tort Claims  Act (ATCA).  My original post called it the Alien Tort Act. </div>

<div>I think Thomas Jefferson would have said the more speech, the better.  That&#8217;s what the First Amendment is all about. So long as the people know where the speech is coming from. … You are entitled to know where the speech is coming from — you know, information as to who contributed what.

<div>&#8212; Justice Antonin Scalia,<a href="http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/18/exclusive-tonight-justice-antonin-scalia/?hpt=pm_mid">responding to interview questions by CNN’s Piers Morgan</a> about <i>Citizens United</i>, Jul. 18
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Antonin Scalia, bless his heart, is on a book tour, which he kicked off yesterday in an interview with Piers Morgan of CNN.  The online and print headlines, predictably (both substantively and procedurally, as lawyers would say), mostly read along the lines of “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/19/us/politics/justice-scalia-says-he-had-no-falling-out-with-chief-justice-roberts.html">Scalia Says He Had No ‘Falling Out’ With Chief Justice</a>” (Adam Liptak, New York Times) and “Scalia says no &#8216;falling out&#8217; with Roberts” (Jesse Holland, Associated Press).  Well, <i>of course</i> that would be the attention-getting subject of the interview.  (Procedurally.)  And, <i>of course</i> Scalia’s had no lasting falling out with Roberts. (Substantively.)
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And, <i>of course </i>that would be the subject of the headlines and the opening paragraphs of news reports on the interview.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>But these headlines and opening paragraphs bury the lede.  Which is that the Disclose Act, which would require disclosure of the identity of all contributors to purportedly-independent campaign-expenditure groups, and of the amounts contributed—the enactment of which congressional Republicans keep blocking—is, it turns out, <i>unnecessary</i>.  As the Times’ Liptak notes, the proposition that “[y]ou are entitled to know where the speech is coming from — you know, information as to who contributed what” is actually part of <i>Citizens United</i> itself; eight justices (all but Thomas) endorsed this in that case, as a rule of First Amendment law.  The First Amendment right of the Koch brothers and the Chamber of Commerce and ExxonMobil to make “independent” campaign expenditures via nonprofit tax-exempt “social welfare” advocacy groups depends upon disclosure not just that the nonprofit tax-exempt “social welfare” advocacy group paid for the ad but also that the Kochs, the Chamber of Commerce, and ExxonMobil donated a specified amount to the nonprofit tax-exempt “social welfare” advocacy group.*
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So sorry, Karl Rove.  But such is life.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Or at least it will be, sometime before the November election, I think.  Because all that is necessary now for this disclosure to be compelled is for the Obama campaign, or the DNC, or the campaign of any Dem candidate who’s being attacked in “independent” campaign ads—or, for that matter, even the news media—to file lawsuits invoking none other than <i>Citizens United</i>, asking the courts to order the disclosure of that information.  Because of the shortness of time before the election, and because of the obvious relevance of this to the November elections—and because this is purely a legal issue, requiring very little factual record—this would proceed through the courts very quickly.
</p>

<div>Liptak also mentions Scalia’s invocation of what even Scalia surely knows is a pretty porous defense of <i>Citizens United</i>:</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Mr. Morgan argued that spending may be regulated because it is not speech.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Justice Scalia responded that money facilitates speech and suggested that it would be unconstitutional to tell a newspaper publisher that “you can only spend so much money in the publication of your newspaper.”</div>
<div>
<p></p>
</div>
<div>Mr. Morgan said that was different, as “newspaper publishers aren’t buying elections.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Justice Scalia said that “newspapers endorse political candidates all the time,” adding that “they’re almost in the business of doing that.”
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Yes, indeed; they almost <i>are</i> in the business of doing that.  But the most jaw-dropping, and mocked, part of the <i>Citizens United </i>opinion is its out-of-nowhere—and clearly false—statement of <i>fact </i>upon which the opinion’s outcome relies: The five justices said they “find” as a matter of <i>fact</i> that unlimited “independent” campaign expenditures gives rise neither to corruption nor to the appearance of it, and therefore the First Amendment free-speech interest trumps the interest in allowing statutory limits on these expenditures.  This is, in other words, not like falsely shouting “Fire” in a crowded theater.  Or like inciting to riot.  Or like …. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The New York Times and the National Review endorsements and commentary don’t operate as <i>de facto</i>bribes, real or perceived by the public.  Nor does anyone other than Scalia and his four cohorts pretend to think so.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>About that independent-expenditures-give-rise-neither-to-corruption-nor-to-the-appearance-of-it thing, among those whose opinions the justices neglected to ask were the seven current justices on the Montana Supreme Court, and those justice famously begged to differ with the <i>Citizens United</i>majority on that point last December, in a case about a longstanding Montana campaign-expenditure statute.  Six to one, they upheld the constitutionality of the Montana statute.  The seventh justice dissented because of <i>Citizens United</i>’s clear mandate, but trashed the finding of fact as clearly false.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>On June 25, the <i>Citizens United</i> majority summarily reversed the Montana Supreme Court.  In a dissent joined by Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan, Stephen Breyer acknowledged that the four dissenters could have forced the Court to have a full hearing on the case—full briefing and an oral argument—next term.  But, he said, there would be no point to it, as the majority had made clear in discussing the Montana case that no member was willing to reconsider any part of the <i>Citizens United</i> ruling, including the ridiculous finding of fact.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It’s not hard to recognize the likelihood then that both Kennedy—the author of <i>Citizens United</i>and apparently the force behind the deeply controversial decision by the majority to raise, on their own, the issue of the constitutionality of centerpiece of the McCain-Feingold statute rather than to just strike down the minor section of the statute the challengers had challenged as unconstitutional—and Roberts, who allowed this stunningly inappropriate judicial role, understand by now that, at least from the prospective of a vast majority of the public, the <i>Citizens United</i>-created status quo is simply untenable. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>There appears to have been some horse-trading there, forced by the minority, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/us/supreme-court-declines-to-revisit-citizens-united.html">who agreed to not force a full hearing in the Montana case</a>, <i>American Tradition Partnership, Inc. v. Bullock</i>, thus relieving the majority from having to defend its indefensible finding of clearly-false fact.  And in return, the majority agreed to interpret <i>Citizens United</i> as mandating meaningful disclosure rather than just gimmicks for effective nondisclosure.  And to do so informally, with enough time before this November’s election for it to actually matter.*</div>
<div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As someone who believes that the current system results in actual corruption and certainly the appearance of corruption, I think the minority got the better of the deal.</p>
<div>In any event, I don’t see how, in light of Scalia’s straight-from-the-horse’s-mouth public statement, lawsuits requesting immediate injunctive relief compelling disclosure could be legitimately denied.

<p>&#8212;-<br />*Obviously, this is speculation on my part. [Added Wed. at 11:36 a.m.]<br />&#8212;-</p>
<p>**CORRECTION: Turns out that I was confusing super PACs with nonprofit tax-exempt “social welfare” advocacy groups. (No surprise, I guess; I’m neither an election-law specialist nor a tax-law specialist.)  So I’ve changed “super PACs” to “nonprofit tax-exempt ‘social welfare’ advocacy groups.”  This matters only because <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/08/us/politics/groups-shield-political-gifts-of-businesses.html?_r=1&#038;pagewanted=all">super PACs already have to disclose their donors</a>. Nonprofit tax-exempt “social welfare” advocacy groups don’t, and so the Disclose Act targeted the latter but not the former in this respect.  The Disclose Act also, though, would have required certain disclosures in each ad itself, whether the ad was sponsored by a super PAC or a &#8220;social welfare&#8221; advocacy group. [Corrected Fri. at 6:38 p.m.]</p>
<div>UPDATE: Hmm.  <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/07/13/what-you-should-know-about-the-disclose-act-part-2-how-does-the-disclose-act-shine-a-light-on-super-pacs-and-dark-money/">Here’s</a> an article from the Sunlight Foundation published on July 13 about the Disclose Act.  The article suggests that super PACs do indeed legally hide the identity of their donors.  [Fri. at 8:37 p.m.] [Ah. <i>There&#8217;s </i>the link; I didn&#8217;t put the link in last night when I posted the update.]

<div>Lost in the shuffle here is the question of what it is Romney is denying he&#8217;s responsible for. Stipulate that Romney somehow had nothing to do with running a company of which he was the CEO and sole shareholder. Does he think, in retrospect, that his subordinates did something wrong by offshoring jobs? Clearly he didn&#8217;t, which highlights the absurdity of his claims not to have been responsible. It&#8217;s true that he wasn&#8217;t running the country [<i>sic</i>] on a day-to-day basis, but he really was titular CEO and had Bain been doing something he deemed outrageous he could and should have stepped in to stop them. But he doesn&#8217;t believe that. And what&#8217;s more,<i> </i><em>all indications are that Barack Obama also doesn&#8217;t think Bain was doing anything wrong</em>. [Emphasis in original.] As president he&#8217;s made no moves to make it illegal for companies to shift production work abroad and has publicly associated himself with a wide range of American firms—from GE to Apple and beyond—who&#8217;ve done just that to varying extents. And we all remember what happened to Obama&#8217;s promise to renegotiate NAFTA after taking office, right?
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In my view both Obama and Romney are quite right about this. I&#8217;ll say more on this during the workweek, but one quick test is do you think there&#8217;s something immoral about the fact that Toyota and BMW have manufacturing facilities located in the United States? Should the Japanese and German governments be stopping Japan- and Germany-based firms from locating production offshore?
</p>

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I posted a comment to it, saying:
</p>
</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>Well, when Obama starts claiming that one of his key qualifications for reelection is that he’s helped create jobs in China—or when Romney starts saying that Bain invested in companies that specialized in moving jobs overseas in exchange for promises by German and Japanese companies to open, or keep, factories in this country—Yglesias’s equivalency argument might be less ridiculous. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>One of Obama’s spot-on arguments against Romney’s claim that his Bain experience was a successful jobs-creation experience rather than merely a successful wealth-creation-for-investors experience is that there’s a huge difference between experience in creating wealth for private investors, by any means available and at whatever expense to others, and creating good for the country’s overall economy and general welfare.  This offshoring issue is a classic case in point. Setting aside whether the federal government has the legal authority to prohibit private companies from offshoring—and I don’t think the government has any such legal authority, except in certain limited national security or foreign policy circumstances—there’s an obvious critical difference between not trying to stop this country’s companies from offshoring, for fear of retribution by other countries’ companies, similar to trying to avoid a tariff war, and aggressively aiding offshoring by American companies irrespective of any up-side for the general American economy. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Add to that that, as several other commenters have pointed out, the German and Japanese companies that offshore in this country do so mainly in manufacturing products or parts for products that will be sold in North America, mostly in this country.  GM, Ford, Chrysler and some U.S. auto-components manufacturing companies have factories in Europe, but the products and components made there are sold in Europe.  Like the German and Japanese auto companies that Yglesias equates with Bain’s offshoring-specialist companies, the American auto-industry companies continue to make the parts and cars sold in their home country in factories in their home country. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Which, of course, would not be the case any longer had the Bush and Obama administrations taken Romney’s advice and let Detroit fail.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That said—and for the same reasons—Yglesias is wrong in saying that unless Romney thinks there’s something wrong with offshoring, it’s absurd for him to deny responsibility for Bain’s investments in offshoring-specialist companies during the three-year period beginning in early 1999.  If in fact Romney was no longer associated with Bain during that period, he would have every right to correct the record, whether or not he thinks there was anything wrong with what Bain did during that time.  But the question of whether Bain did anything wrong in investing in offshoring-specialist companies—during the period between 1993 and 1999, when (at least as I understand it) it apparently was doing so at Romney’s clear behest, or during the following three years—depends on what is meant by “wrong.” 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>It was not illegal.  But many voters think that, while it clearly was helpful to Bain’s investors and to Romney (who has continued since then to receive large payments from Bain), it was not helpful to the larger American economy and to the middle class.  It did not create jobs in this country; instead, it eliminated them.  And Romney is running for president virtually entirely on his claimed credential of being a jobs creator and of knowing how to create jobs—in America.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’m <a href="http://www.destinyland.org/when_she_was_good.htm">hesitant to be too critical of Yglesias</a> for his rather obvious conflations here.  He was, after all, not just the first pundit but also one of the very few even yet to point out a stunning, absolutely <i>jaw-dropping</i>proposition of law stated by <i>four of the nine</i> Supreme Court justices in their joint dissent late last month in the Affordable Care Act case, the part of the dissent concerning the issue of the severability of the part of the Medicaid provision in the Act that the Court’s majority struck down, in which the dissenters, while claiming that the majority was rewriting the Medicaid provision in order to save much of it, wanted to rewrite, rather dramatically, the Constitution’s separation of powers between Congress and the Court. Only four hours after the release of the opinion, when almost no one except the journalists covering the Court had yet read the dissent, Yglesias <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/06/28/why_the_dissenters_thought_dentist_deregulation_was_unconstitutional.html">wrote</a>:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As I&#8217;ve noticed previously, there&#8217;s lots of other stuff in the Affordable Care Act besides the new regulation of insurance companies, including a move to <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2012/06/26/the_affordable_care_act_vs_the_dentists_cartel.html">deregulate dental services</a>. So I was curious to see why the dissenters in the Supreme Court thought that not only was the individual mandate and the provisions related to the individual mandate unconstitutional, but also all this other stuff.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The answer is that they appear to have made up a new Christmas Tree Doctrine under which legitimate acts of Congress are held null and void if Antonin Scalia thinks they were part of some kind of unseemly horse-trading:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Some provisions, such as requiring chain restaurants to display nutritional content, appear likely to operate as Congress intended, but they fail the second test for severability. There is no reason to believe that Congress would have enacted them independently. The Court has not previously had occasion to consider severability in the context of an omnibus enactment like the ACA, which includes not only many provisions that are ancillary to its central provisions but also many that are entirely unrelated—hitched on because it was a quick way to get them passed despite opposition, or because their proponents could exact their enactment as the quid pro quo for their needed support. When we are confronted with such a so called “Christmas tree,” a law to which many nongermane ornaments have been attached, we think the proper rule must be that when the tree no longer exists the ornaments are superfluous. We have no reliable basis for knowing which pieces of the Act would have passed on their own. It is certain that many of them would not have, and it is not a proper function of this Court to guess which.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>That all seems fine except I would have thought it was the prelude to the <i>opposite</i> ruling. It&#8217;s not the proper function of the court to guess why different provisions were enacted, just to rule on the constitutionality of laws. Since there&#8217;s plainly no constitutional problem with regulating interstate chain restaurants, the law is the law until Congress repeals the law. Instead, Justices Scalia, Alito, Kennedy, and Thomas have decided that rather than pick and choose it would be better to strike everything.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
</div>
<div>This is far, far more newsworthy than the teensy bit of attention it has received suggests.  Four Supreme Court justices think legislative <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logrolling">logrolling</a> is improper and that therefore the Court can strike down full pieces of legislation that a majority of justices don’t like whenever they decide that some provision, however small, in the full piece of legislation is unconstitutional.  After all, y’know, maybe the rest of the legislation would not have been enacted without the <i>quid pro quo</i> votes.  Presumably, this also would apply to state laws as well as to federal laws—but, of course, as with federal laws, only to laws that the conservatives don’t like.

<p>I’d been meaning to write about this truly radical part of the dissent in the ACA case, but hadn’t gotten around to it.  Now I have.</p>

<p>Toward a Supreme Court Showdown<br />
<blockquote>Six federal courts have ruled on the Defense of Marriage Act and reached the same conclusion: the 1996 law violates the Constitution by denying same-sex couples, who are legally married under state law, federal benefits afforded to heterosexual couples for no good reason. The issue has now <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/10/us/an-unexpected-alliance-in-a-same-sex-marriage-case.html">officially landed at the Supreme Court</a>.</p>
<p>Last week, the Obama administration asked the justices to review two court decisions — one by <a href="http://www.ca1.uscourts.gov/pdf.opinions/10-2204P-01A.pdf">the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit</a> and one by <a href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2012/02/another-court-finds-defense-of-marriage-act-unconstitutional-115243.html">a Federal District Court in San Francisco</a> — striking down the law’s denial of benefits on equal protection grounds. </p></blockquote>

<p>Tax Foundation Misses the Ball (again) in its analysis of Supreme Court Health Care Ruling</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/">Tax Foundation</a> pretends to be non-partisan.  Of course we all know that is pretense.  Look at the way it has pushed its concept of the so-called &#8220;tax freedom day&#8221;, which misleads everyday Americans into thinking that they are working for months and months to pay taxes, based on the use of &#8220;average&#8221; tax burdens across every American from Bill Gates to Joe Unemployed and a good deal of uncertainty about just who pays what taxes (like the corporate taxes).</p>
<p>They&#8217;ve done it again in their analysis of the health care decision.  See Richard Morrison and Joseph Henchman, Tax Foundation, <a href="http://www.heraldnews.com/newsnow/x1660542461/GUEST-OPINION-The-tax-flaw-in-health-care-ruling">Guest Opinion, The Tax Flaw in Health Care Ruling</a>, The Hearld News (July 3, 2012).</p>
<p>1.  The Tax Foundation builds its conclusion into its description of the givens.<br />They start out with their conclusion&#8211;a definition of taxes as items whose intent is &#8220;raising revenue for government spending&#8221; and of a &#8220;penalty&#8221; as &#8220;imposed for the purpose of punishing an individual for an unlawful act.&#8221;  Based on that conclusory definition, they conclude unsurprisingly that the ACA&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Individual_mandate">individual mandate</a> is not a tax, because it is a penalty.  That kind of argument has the cart leading the horse.<br />Taxes do increase revenues, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they cannot also be used to modify behavior, which is what penalties do.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>The obvious type of taxes that act as penalties are excise taxes. There is considerable discussion about &#8220;sin taxes&#8221;&#8211;taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and other commodities or behaviors that are disliked.  If the person engages in the &#8216;bad&#8217; behavior, the person pays the tax penalty and at least the government gets some revenue from the misbehavior.  If the person is discouraged from engaging in the bad behavior because of the tax penalty, the penalty has done its job and there is more of the desired good behavior.  Tax penalties also exist in our current income tax laws&#8211;the &#8220;singles penalty&#8221;, as mentioned in a prior post, causes a single person to pay more tax than that person would if married, thus penalizing the person for failure to marry.  (Conversely, in situations where there is a <a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2012/07/paul-morenos-short-history-of-the-taxing-power.html">marriage penalty</a>, the tax causes a married person to pay more tax than that person would if single, thus penalizing the person for failure to divorce.)  And there are many credits and other items that can be seen as simply notational variations on a penalty.  For example, the greater tax that childless couples pay than couples of the same income with children pay can easily be viewed as a tax penalty for not having children.</p>
<p>2.  The Tax Foundation tries to raise fears of a bad impact for states<br />The Tax Foundation&#8217;s next argument is the old &#8220;slippery slope&#8221; problem (and depends on the success of their first, unsuccessful, argument).  Since it claims the tax versus penalty distinction is &#8220;vital&#8221;, and there are local and state government revenue sources that are not generally thought of as taxes, the Foundation also claims that the Supreme Court&#8217;s purported broadening of the concept of tax could mean those state and local items must also be treated as taxes for state law purposes, and this could mean that they will be subject to different procedural rules for taxes rather than the procedural rules under which they were passed.<br />This appears beyond silly.   What it does mean for states is that a state like Massachusetts, that had already passed a state health care law with a mandate similar to the ACA&#8217;s mandate, can rest assured that it is not an unconstitutional form of tax.</p>
<p>3.  The Tax Foundation misunderstands the relationship between the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commerce_Clause">Commerce Clause</a> and the Taxing Power<br />The Foundation didn&#8217;t want the mandate upheld, and the right-wing is fighting hard for a much narrower view of the Commerce Clause with the idea of preventing progressives from undertaking needed national policies.  The Court found the Commerce Clause didn&#8217;t extend to the mandate, a conclusion which seems extraordinarily weak to me and which I predict will be overturned by another Court within thirty years.<br />But the Commerce Clause doesn&#8217;t decide the case, because the taxing power is even broader than the Commerce Clause power.  And Roberts rightly recognized that.  This was not a &#8220;twisting [of] the traditional and historic meaning of a tax&#8221; but rather the expected and predictable analysis based on the traditional and historic understanding of the taxing power.</p>
<p>4. The Tax Foundation raises the &#8220;direct&#8221; tax issue<br />Tax academics have devoted a lot of discussion to consider what would be a direct tax that had to be apportioned among the states.  Calvin Johnson, Professor at the University of Texas,  wrote an interesting book looking into the history of the Constitutional Convention as motivated in large part by a desire to get around the weak taxing power of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a>, which required requisitions from the states to allow a strong taxing power in the federal government.  the passage of the income tax amendment&#8211;contravening any need for apportionment&#8211;pretty much left the direct/apportioned taxes as an archaic category.</p>
<p>The article cclaims that the mandate can&#8217;t fall within the income tax since it is a flat tax.  But of course everyone knows that the Tax Foundation and every other right-wing organization thinks that a flat tax on income is constitutional. </p>
<p>The Tax Foundation is quite simply wrong in suggesting that this is a &#8220;new&#8221; definition of tax.<br />(By the way, the Tax Foundation also attributes the entire opinion (and the purported &#8220;new definition&#8221;) to Chief Justice Roberts.  He was the author of the opinion for the Court, but the opinion represents the views of a majority of the Supreme Court Justices.  It is not just Roberts&#8217; opinion. )</p>

                                <p>
<div>I think there was a clue to Roberts’ thinking during the first day of argument—during the argument on the applicability of the Anti-Injunction Act, an obscure “jurisdictional” statute, which precludes courts from ruling on the constitutionality of a federal tax until after the statute becomes effective and the tax actually is due.  Roberts really indicated during that argument that he was interested in finding a way to rule that the penalty was a tax for purposes of Congress’s taxing power but not a tax for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act.  That would remove the issue of whether the mandate was within Congress’s Commerce power, since if it is a tax, the mandate and penalty/tax are within Congress’s taxing power.  And then the only issue would be whether this violated the Fifth Amendment’s due process clause (liberty! broccoli!).
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Late in the argument on the mandate issue the next day, under questioning by Sotomayor, the challengers’ lawyer, Paul Clement, conceded that under its taxing power, Congress could do pretty much the same thing as it did under what Congress thought its Commerce power allowed it to do.  That effectively killed the due process (liberty! broccoli!) argument, since for purposes of that argument, it made no difference which Congress’s powers authorized it to enact the mandate and the related penalty.

<div>While the Court’s upholding the mandate is deservedly taking front stage in the media coverage, the Court’s decision to strike down a part of the Medicaid expansion may ultimately have broader jurisdprudential consequence.  That, at least, will be a subject of debate among lawyers and academics in the days and weeks to come.  This is the first time (as far as I know) that the Court has actually found a Spending Clause condition unconstitutionally coercive.  Whether it establishes principles that make many other programs vulnerable is a question that will require further analysis and debate.  Lyle Dennisten will start that analysis in an post later today or tomorrow morning.

<div></div>
<div>I one of the many updates to my initial post this morning, mentioned this exchange between Lyle Denniston and Tom Goldstein (SCOTUSblog’s publisher:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lyle: The rejection of the Commerce Clause and Nec. and Proper Clause should be understood as a major blow to Congress&#8217;s authority to pass social welfare laws. Using the tax code &#8212; especially in the current political environment &#8212; to promote social welfare is going to be a very chancy proposition.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tom: I dissent from Lyle&#8217;s view that the Commerce Clause ruling is a major blow to social welfare legislation. I think that piece of the decision will be read pretty narrowly.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div> I wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div>I’m almost always in agreement with Lyle’s analyses (as is, I’m sure, Tom Goldstein, who is the blog’s publisher and also a major Supreme Court litigator; Amy Howe, also a lawyer, is Goldstein’s wife).  But, like Goldstein, I disagree with Lyle on this one.  In order for the Court to interpret this opinion as limiting Congress’s authority to enact social welfare legislation, the Court would have to place in question a slew of current, longstanding social welfare programs.  I don’t think that was Roberts’ intent—really, I don’t—and I don’t think the opinion will be viewed that way.  Unless, of course, Romney wins and appoints a wingnut to replace, say, Ginsburg if her health does not hold out.  </p>
</div>
<div>
<div>Here’s what I think will happen: </p>
<p><a name="more"></a>But first, I need to point out that Medicaid, unlike Social Security and Medicare, are programs structured as partnerships between the respective states and the federal government, each paying some portion of the cost, and that Medicaid has always contained a provision that makes state participation voluntary and that allows states to remove themselves from the program if they want to.  Social Security and Medicare, by contrast, are solely federally-funded and federally-run programs. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The 26 states that challenged the ACA’s Medicaid provision argued that a provision in the Medicaid section of the ACA allows the federal government to withdraw all federal funds for a state’s entire Medicaid program—that is, the money it already is receiving—if a state opts out of the Medicaid-expansion part of the ACA.  The states argued that this was too coercive and therefore violates principles of state sovereignty.  Seven justices—the four dissenters, Roberts, Breyer and Kagan—agreed with that claim, and so they ruled that, while the federal government can put conditions on its funding of the new expansion, and can withdraw the money for that expansion if a state doesn’t comply with the conditions, the federal government <i>can’t</i>withdraw funding also for the earlier parts of Medicaid that the state already was receiving.</div>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Sooo …. this ruling certainly (in my opinion) appears to have no effect whatsoever on any program funded entirely through, and administered by, the federal government.  And i tappears to have no effect on any social welfare program that is a partnership between states and the federal government as long as there is no threat by the federal government to withdraw funds already being given to the state for something else, in order to get the state to agree to participate in the new partnership, or in the new part of the part of the partnership.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I just don’t see how this restricts in any significant way Congress’s ability to enact social welfare programs.  I think that ruling is really very narrow.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>As an aside, I want to mention the four dissents who wanted to strike down the entire ACA tried to at least persuade Roberts that the entire Medicaid-expansion part of the statute simply because that one provision in that part of the Act was ruled unconstitutional—even though, as Roberts points out, the Act includes what’s known as a “severability” provision providing that if any particular section of the Act is ruled unconstitutional, the section should be severed from the remainder of the statute, and the remainder should remain in force.  This let’s-see-if-we-can-get-the-tail-to-wag-the-dog-and-win-on-this-part-at-least tack of the minority was so transparently inappropriate that Roberts, in responding to it in his opinion, seems downright offended by it.  Good for him.

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>UPDATE: From SCOTUSblog: &#8220;The bottom line: the entire ACA is upheld, with the exception that the federal government&#8217;s power to terminate states&#8217; Medicaid funds is narrowly read.&#8221;</p>
<p>TOTAL, TOTAL VICTORY   !!!!
<div></div>
<div>SECOND UPDATE: The opinion is 5-4, with Roberts voting with the Dem appointees and writing the opinion, and Kennedy writing the main dissent.
</p>
</div>
<div><a name="more"></a></div>
<div>Here’s more from SCOTUSblog:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The money quote from the section on the mandate: Our precedent demonstrates that Congress had the power to impose the exaction in Section 5000A under the taxing power, and that Section 5000A need not be read to do more than impose a tax. This is sufficient to sustain it.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The court reinforces that individuals can simply refuse to pay the tax and not comply with the mandate.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Nothing in our opinion precludes Congress from offering funds under the ACA to expand the availability of health care, and requiring that states accepting such funds comply with the conditions on their use. What Congress is not free to do is to penalize States that choose not to participate in that new program by taking away their existing Medicaid funding.&#8221; (p. 55)</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>And (added after second update was posted):
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Another way to think about Medicaid: the Constitution requires that states have a choice about whether to participate in the expansion of eligibility; if they decide not to, they can continue to receive funds for the rest of the program.</div>
<p>The most talked-about part surely will be “individuals can simply refuse to pay the tax and not comply with the mandate” part.  Is it really a mandate at all if there’s no penalty for refusal to comply?  So maybe it&#8217;s not a total victory, after all.  But it&#8217;s still a big, big victory.  
</p>
<p>(The Medicaid part of the ruling has no effect on the breadth or implementation of the law at all.)</p>
<div>THIRD UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Correction from SCOTUSblog (and HT to buffpilot in the comment to my post):
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Apologies &#8211; you can&#8217;t refuse to pay the tax; typo. The only effect of not complying with the mandate is that you pay the tax.  </p>
<p>Looks like everything revolves on it being a tax.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ah-hah!! It IS a TOTAL, TOTAL victory.  !!!</p>
<div>FOURTH UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Again from SCOTUSblog:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>In Plain English: The Affordable Care Act, including its individual mandate that virtually all Americans buy health insurance, is constitutional. There were not five votes to uphold it on the ground that Congress could use its power to regulate commerce between the states to require everyone to buy health insurance. However, five Justices agreed that the penalty that someone must pay if he refuses to buy insurance is a kind of tax that Congress can impose using its taxing power. That is all that matters. Because the mandate survives, the Court did not need to decide what other parts of the statute were constitutional, except for a provision that required states to comply with new eligibility requirements for Medicaid or risk losing their funding. On that question, the Court held that the provision is constitutional as long as states would only lose new funds if they didn&#8217;t comply with the new requirements, rather than all of their funding.  
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<p>Yup. Total, total victory.  </p>
</p>
<p>
<div>FIFTH UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>From SCOTUSblog:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Court holds that the mandate violates the Commerce Clause, but that doesn&#8217;t matter b/c there are five votes for the mandate to be constitutional under the taxing power.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Well, kudos, to … um … me.  I called it pretty nearly spot-on.  I began to sort of wonder in the last few days whether in fact I really was onto something, because my post from June 15 laying that out (again) kept getting more and more “hits” as the days went by.  Usually my posts stop getting “hits” a few days after I post them.  I actually began (almost) thinking it was possible that a few people from within the Court itself—i.e., law clerks to the justices—were clicking the post after possibly being told of it by someone who reads, maybe, Business Insider.  If so, that would seem to indicate that I actually had called it right.  But I dared not <i>really</i> think that Supreme Court law clerks were reading my post.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Btw, in a comment to a blog conversation on Slate on Monday, I wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hmm.  Well, having gone out on a limb 10 days ago on a blog I write for, posting an article that discusses as one of the more likely possible healthcare-case results the tax-law outcome that Savage suggests in his LA Times article today, I’m feeling ever-so-slightly less lonely out on that tree branch.  At least now I’ll have someone to cling to on Thursday as the limb falls to the ground. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The blog conversation is ongoing there.  The current latest entry (from last night) is <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/the_breakfast_table/features/2012/_supreme_court_year_in_review/supreme_court_year_in_review_who_lost_obamacare_the_leading_suspects_are_the_solicitor_general_the_white_house_liberal_law_professors_and_five_supreme_court_justices_.html">here</a>, should any AB readers be interested. </div>
</div>
<div>SIXTH UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div>Salvaging the idea that Congress did have the power to try to expand health care to virtually all Americans, the Supreme Court on Monday upheld the constitutionality of the crucial – and most controversial — feature of the Affordable Care Act.   By a vote of 5-4, however, the Court did not sustain it as a command for Americans to buy insurance, but as a tax if they don’t.  That is the way Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr., was willing to vote for it, and his view prevailed.  The other Justices split 4-4, with four wanting to uphold it as a mandate, and four opposed to it in any form.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Since President Obama signed the new law, it has been understood by almost everyone that the expansion of health care coverage to tens of millions of Americans without it could work — economically — only if the health insurance companies were guaranteed a large pool of customers.   The mandate to buy health insurance by 2014 was the method Congress chose to supply that pool.   It is not immediately clear whether the Court’s approach will produce as large a pool of new customers.   The ACA’s key provision now amounts to an invitation to buy insurance, rather than an order to do so, with a not-very-big tax penalty for going without.
</p>
</div>

</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Those are the first two paragraphs of Lyle’s (I love him, and can refer to him by his first name if I want to) three-paragraph initial article on the regular blog (as opposed to the live blog).  He’s sure to post updates to the article later today.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Earlier, on the live blog, Amy Howe wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Take a quick look at Footnote 11, which is on page 44 of the slip opinion: Those subject to the individual mandate may lawfully forgo health insurance and pay higher taxes, or buy health insurance and pay lower taxes. The only thing that they may not lawfully do is not buy health insurance and not pay the resulting tax.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>And for those of you who remember my writing about an obscure court-jurisdiction statute called the Anti-Injunction Act, which was a subject of controversy in the case, Lyle, writing earlier on the live blog, wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Interesting, at least to scholars, that while the mandate and its attached penalty are a tax for purposes of its constitutionality, but not for the Anti-Injunction Act. If it were a tax for AIA purposes, this case would not have been decided re the mandate.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also on the live blog, Lyle wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The rejection of the Commerce Clause and Nec. and Proper Clause should be understood as a major blow to Congress&#8217;s authority to pass social welfare laws. Using the tax code &#8212; especially in the current political environment &#8212; to promote social welfare is going to be a very chancy proposition.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Tom Goldstein then wrote:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I dissent from Lyle&#8217;s view that the Commerce Clause ruling is a major blow to social welfare legislation. I think that piece of the decision will be read pretty narrowly.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>I’m almost always in agreement with Lyle’s analyses (as is, I’m sure, Tom Goldstein, who is the blog’s publisher and also a major Supreme Court litigator; Amy Howe, also a lawyer, is Goldstein’s wife).  But, like Goldstein, I disagree with Lyle on this one.  In order for the Court to interpret this opinion as limiting Congress’s authority to enact social welfare legislation, the Court would have to place in question a slew of current, longstanding social welfare programs.  I don’t think that was Roberts’ intent—really, I don’t—and I don’t think the opinion will be viewed that way.  Unless, of course, Romney wins and appoints a wingnut to replace, say, Ginsburg if her health does not hold out.  
</p>
</div>
<div>SEVENTH (Yikes!) UPDATE:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>This one’s not from SCOTUSblog.  It’s from Ginsburg’s concurrence, joined by Breyer, Sotomayor and Kagan:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>At bottom, THE  CHIEF  JUSTICE’s and the joint dissenters’ “view that an individual cannot be subject to Commerce Clause regulation absent voluntary, affirmative acts that enter him or her into, or affect, the interstate market expresses a concern for individual liberty that [is] more redolent of Due Process Clause arguments.”  SevenSky, 661 F. 3d, at 19.  See also  Troxel v.  Granville, 530 U. S. 57, 65 (2000) (plurality opinion) (“The [Due Process] Clause also includes a substantive component that provides heightened protection against government interference with certain fundamental rights and liberty interests.” (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Plaintiffs have abandoned any argument pinned to substantive due process, however, see 648 F. 3d 1235, 1291, n. 93 (CA11 2011), and now concede that the provisions here at issue do not offend the Due Process Clause.8
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>Footnote 8 says:
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>8. Some adherents to the joint dissent have questioned the existence of substantive due process rights.  See McDonald v.  Chicago, 561 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (THOMAS, J., concurring) (slip op., at 7) (The notion that the Due Process Clause “could define the substance of th[e] righ[t to liberty] strains credulity.”); Albright v. Oliver, 510 U. S. 266, 275 (1994) (SCALIA, J., concurring) (“I reject the proposition that the Due Process Clause guarantees certain (unspecified) liberties[.]”).  Given these Justices’ reluctance to interpret the Due Process Clause as guaranteeing liberty interests, their willingness to plant such protections in the Commerce Clause is striking.
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>The <i>SevenSky</i> opinion, <i>SevenSky v. Holder</i>, that Ginsburg quotes from was written last November by Lawrence Silberman, a Reagan appointee to the federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and one of the most respected (in conservative legal circles) federal appellate judges, in one of the ACA cases. As for Ginsburg’s footnote 8, she says something I’ve wondered about all along: Substantive due process is legal doctrine under which <i>Roe v. Wade</i>and, before that, the opinion striking down  a Connecticut law that prohibited the sale and use of contraceptives, were based.  <i>Lawrence v. Texas</i>, the 2003 Kennedy opinion invalidating Texas’s sodomy statute also was based on that doctrine.  Thomas and Scalia routinely lambaste the doctrine, as do many other tea partier folks. 
</p>
</div>
<div></div>
<div>So the question is: Do these people now concede the appropriateness of the legal doctrine underlying those cases they hate so much?
</p>
</div>
<p></div>

                                <p>Amy Howe, <em>Anticipating the health-care decision: In Plain English</em>,  <a href="http://www.scotusblog.com/2012/06/anticipating-the-health-care-decision-in-plain-english/%E2%80%9C%3ESCOTUSblog%3C/a">SCOTUSblog&#8221;</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>…there are four questions before it. Three of those questions revolve around the “minimum coverage” provision, popularly known as the “individual mandate.” </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>…But before the Court can decide whether the mandate is constitutional, it must first decide whether it can even rule on this question at all. </p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>…all that anyone will really be interested in with regard to the AIA is the Court’s bottom line: can it review the mandate issue or not? If it agrees with both sides that it can, all eyes will then turn to that constitutional question. Most Americans care about the bottom line: is the mandate constitutional? Even if the Justices disagree on the reasoning, the mandate would still survive.</p>
<p>Finally, as long as the Court doesn’t conclude that the entire ACA must fall, it will have to resolve one more issue: does another provision of the Act violate the Constitution because it effectively coerces the states, requiring them to comply with the ACA’s expanded Medicaid eligibility requirements or risk losing all of the money that they receive for Medicaid from the federal government?</p></blockquote>
