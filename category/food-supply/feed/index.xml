<p>From OMB Watch alert <a href="http://www.ombwatch.org/node/12039" target="_blank">Letting the Fox Guard the Hen house</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The U.S. Department of Agriculture&#8217;s (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) made the front page of The New York Times this week for its proposal to change the way chickens and other poultry are inspected in processing plants before they are sent to supermarkets and butcher shops all across the country. In January, the agency published a controversial new proposal that would shift responsibility for inspections away from agency inspectors and allow employees of the slaughtering plants to judge their own handiwork. We’re not the only ones who think asking chicken producers to police themselves might be a bad idea.</p></blockquote>
