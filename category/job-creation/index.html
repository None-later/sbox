                            <div class="content">
                                <div><i>First a qualification.  I am basing the following on info I found on the net.  If the info is wrong, then I stand corrected as to who is or is not paying but not as to what happens when a large entity does not pay.   The specific city and company are used purely for example purpose because of familiarity.  What follows could be any municipality with a similar size company calling it home.</i></div>
<div></div>
<div>Lately in the city of my flower shop the big talk is a $10 million deficit in the school department.  It&#8217;s a funny story.  See, the department hired a couple people and these people, along with the help of the city council and the school committee the budget numbers became not real.   They budgeted $59 million but have spent $66.6 million.  The total $10 million is a 2 year deficit. The funny part&#8230;we had a surplus.  Though, where the surplus went to no one knows.  The school committee insists there was no funny business and even voted down an investigation.  So, if there was no funny business, then who gained and what did they gain by covering up a deficit?  What benefit is there about lying about a deficit?  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course, this is also a state funding issue.  You see, the city has the typical city size problems that the surrounding town do not have.  This a<a href="http://www.valleybreeze.com/2012/03/06/nsbw/school-deficit-for-2012-expected-to-exceed-7-million">rticle notes</a>:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>“The committee chair pointed out that Lincoln has a budget of $48 million to educate half the students Woonsocket teaches with a mere $59 million.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;And they don&#8217;t have the special needs we have. They don&#8217;t even have a quarter of the IEPs we deal with,&#8221; she said.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>On top of this, we&#8217;re one of those states that has been passing ALEX  type legislation.  In particular we passed  the one that thinks it is smart of a state to set a cap on how much a municipality can raise taxes in any given year.   The city notes that default is an option, but is currently begging the state legislature to allow a supplemental tax bill.   </div>

<div>I <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/03/divorced-one-like-bush-on-property.html">posted sometime ago</a> on just how dubious the ideas involving tax policy can be. It&#8217;s not as simple as not raising taxes or adding development.  I have <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/tax-cuts-paid-for-with-job-creation.html">also posted </a>on tax breaks and how much it takes in job creation to make up for them.  It&#8217;s basically impossible for job creation to cover the breaks never mind actually producing income greater than the tax break.  This brings us to my flower shop&#8217;s city.  It all comes together in real life for Woonsocket, RI. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Woonsocket has what should be considered a huge resource: CVS/Caremark.  CVS began in Woonsocket.  They love Woonsocket.  It&#8217;s their home. It was (WAS) a wonderful company if you talk to those who worked there sometime before 1990 or so when the founder turned the company over to more professional management as CVS decided to get big.  I&#8217;m certain there are many other towns and cities which have a resource such as CVS/Caremark.   They are assumed to be a benefit to the municipality. .   I&#8217;m also certain these municipalities have experienced the negatives of having such a resource, namely the threat of demise of the municipality if certain privileges are not granted.  These privileges that are “requested” are often in the form of money that will not be paid: tax relief.   After all, an entity such as CVS/Caremark is not considered a resource because it generates money.    It  is because they give the people of the municipality something to do to earn money that entities like CVS/Caremark are a &#8220;resource&#8221;.    The threat is that the resource is &#8216;A&#8217; major or &#8216;the&#8217; major employer of the region.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Some would say the results of tax exemptions are simply good negotiations.  They are contracts.  Are you aware of the phrase: <a href="http://legaldictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Adhesion+Contract">Contracts of Adhesion</a>?</div>
<blockquote><div><i>A type of contract, a legally binding agreement between two parties to do a certain thing, in which one side has all the bargaining power and uses it to write the contract primarily to his or her advantage.</i></div>
</blockquote>
<div>Keep the phrase in mind as you continue reading.  Also keep in mind that good contracts have a performance clause.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This brings us to the issue of Woonsocket&#8217;s deficit.  Some have asked why does CVS not just write a check?  Not a gift, but a check and then offer up it&#8217;s best minds to help prevent this from happening again.  After all, why would a company like CVS want to be in a place that is struggling so much?  Do they not want their environment to reflect their self image?  There is a meme circulating that only 10,000 people pay taxes in Woonsocket.  Some have said it is only 10% of the city&#8217;s population that is paying..  Either way, if that is all that is paying in a municipality of 43,000 people, well then that is the total number of property owners.  Though Woonsocket has a lot of people renting from those 10,000 property owners.  Who is paying the taxes?</div>
<div></div>
<div>This got me wondering.  How much does CVS/Caremark pay in property taxes to the city.  The data which follows was sent to my local newspaper editor.  I received no response.</div>
<div>  </div>
<p>
<div>I found a web site that allows you to look up any tax account in any participating municipality. <a href="http://opaldata.net/ritaxrolls"> RI is here</a>.  I typed in CVS first and came up with accounts related to tangible assets.  A lot of exemptions for those.  We are talking property taxes.  So I looked up <i>1 CVS Drive </i>and got the account that appears to list the actual real estate related to CVS/Caremark corporate operations.  Account number R00-0132-87.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The total assessment for 2011 tax year is $1,149,108.12.   2010 was $1,081,809.76.   For 2009 it was $953,050.27.  The three year total is $3,183,968.15. This is a lot of money.   And all of it was exempted.  The tax bills show $0.00 as total due.  The individual bills state: Adjustment type: 07, tax exempt property.  Based on this data, for the past 3 years, CVS/Caremark or who ever owns the land they sit on has paid nothing.  To make matters worse, using their highest valued property, the assessment was only 2.5%.  My flower shop, as commercial property has an assessment of 3.17%!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Ok, so they get a break.  Usually these breaks are in exchange for jobs based on supposedly creating a greater overall income benefit for the tax gifting municipality.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I did some simple calculations as to how many people need to be employed to make up the $1,149,108.12 per year.  Using City-data.com and the 2009 census for Woonsocket, the median household income was $39,964,  the median family income was $48,680, median non-family income was $20,609, the per capita median was $20,627.    For these income ranges, the state&#8217;s income tax rate is 3.75%. Again, doing some simple math (you know I like simple) produced a range of income tax collected of $1825.50 (median family income) to $772.84 (per capita).   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Using income tax is appropriate because if the City is not collecting property taxes in exchange for jobs, then the state income tax is where the money will come from.  This means that the City needs from CVS 630 more family job equivalents than employed in 2011 to make up for the property tax not paid or 1487 more job equivalents median income per capita.   The State of RI has to earmark the income tax it collects  from 630 to 1487 jobs at CVS/Caremark for Woonsocket just to make up for their exemption.  Of course, there is no way a state is going to cut up it&#8217;s collections that way.  I mean, can you imagine what all the other municipalities would do?  Also, we&#8217;re talking job equivalents. A handful of people being paid enough, at 3.75% could do what 1487 jobs do.  Say, a CEO who was paid $29.2 million in compensation for 2010.  Of course, only $1.5 million was “salary”.  The rest was pension and stocks transactions such that by the time the total was rung up the <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703806304576233143088595876.html">CEO had $125 million</a> “&#8230;for his final 14 months or so on the job&#8230;” </div>
<div>3.75% of $1.5 million is only $56,250.  Not much, unless you are earning Woonsockets median income. Though 3.75% of $123.5 million is $4,631,250.   To bad it&#8217;s payment via stocks.  I doubt the stock value is treated the same as salary or wages.  Woonsocket and the state lose.</div>
<div></div>
<div>It&#8217;s to bad because those who are paid via wages and thus paying the income tax which has to make up for the property tax not paid by CVS/Caremark means those workers are in actuality giving back part of their earnings to CVS/Caremark.  It&#8217;s their wages that are paying what CVS/Caremark would have paid if not for the exemptions. What a racket.  Of course, there is no specific earmarking to Woonsocket of the income taxes collected via CVS/Caremark jobs.  In fact, the state has changed the formula for distributing money to the towns thus Woonsocket is getting less than it used to get for giving CVS/Caremark property tax exemptions.  That means, those property owners and renters in Woonsocket are primarily carrying the load for CVS/Caremark share.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Tax breaks of any type in exchange for jobs is a fools deal.  It is a devils bargain.  It traps the host municipalities (local or state) and creates a kind of contract of adhesion.  The trap is the “going Galt” threat.   The use of such taxation activity to improve a local economy only leads to the demise of the municipality over time.  There is just no way for one large entity (CVS like entity)  to off load it&#8217;s share of the costs of living onto a smaller entity (43,000 people of a municipality) such that both grow in multiples that produce a greater outcome than had both paid equally based on their income, wealth, use of the commons, etc.    </div>
<div></div>
<div>This is especially critical to understand during the current past decades where wages have been declining relative to inflation.  A decline by the way that entities like CVS have promoted. It is not like the majority of municipalities are full of only 1%&#8217;ers.  When the tax base is declining do to an inability to pay the assessments (this is the true tax base identity not the property values), giving tax breaks as a means to grow to those who&#8217;s incomes have risen as a result of fostering declining overall income to the masses just seems stupid.  Here, let me pay for that knife you are going to stick in me.   Again, what a racket!   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Think about it.  How can an entity that generates $7.944 billion (<a href="http://www.budget.ri.gov/Documents/CurrentFY/ExecutiveSummary/2_Overview.pdf">RI 2013 proposed budget</a>) support an entity that generates a net revenue <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/stock/CVS_Caremark_Corporation_%28CVS%29%20">of $96.4 billion</a> (CVS 2010) via give backs to the larger entity such that the smaller entity will grow?   </div>
<p>Lastly, why do we continue to set policy based on an idea that a company can exist without employees?  Why do we insist on ignoring the obvious, both are needed for a company to live.  Neither one is more important or stands independently.   Of course, the answer is because we let companies threaten and sometime go Galt by pitting one group of citizens against another.  On a larger scale it&#8217;s called outsourcing.</p>

<p><strong>Guest post:  The Obama Record after 3 years &#8211; Jobs and GDP</strong></p>
<p>The performance of the economy over President Obama’s tenure to date has been much discussed in light of the severe contraction that began in December 2007 .. and the policies implemented to correct course and restore growth. As of early 2012, the economic recovery shows signs of gathering momentum. Since the enactment of the Recovery Act .. and especially now with the presidential campaign season heating up .. misrepresentations have been piling up. Despite the fact that the economy has been creating jobs for 22 consecutive months, his opponents continue to attack his record … a recent example: <em>“This president has been on the attack and has been a job killer,”</em> GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney told a town hall meeting in Salem, N.H. Another example: <em>“Either the president’s economic policies are killing this economy, or his lack of leadership,”</em> Rick Santorum said in September. <em>“Either way, President Obama is to blame.”</em></p>
<p>Here’s the<strong> factual record</strong> on economic growth and private sector job growth. In both cases, the graph displays the data points from the beginning of January 2007, showing the run-up to the Recession, followed by the enactment of the Recovery Act and the subsequent recovery through December 2011.</p>
<p>The two graphs below display:<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Quarterly Real GDP, Q1 2007 though Q3 2011, sourced from BEA NIPA table 1.1.6 <a href="http://www.bea.gov/national/nipaweb/TableView.asp?SelectedTable=6&#038;FirstYear=2010&#038;LastYear=2011&#038;Freq=Qtr">here:</a><br />Private Sector Jobs, monthly net change January 2007 through December 2011, sourced from the BLS data series CES0500000001<a href="http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/surveymost?ce"> here:</a></p>
<p><strong>Quarterly Real GDP Q1 2007 – Q3 2011, billions 2005 dollars:</strong><br /><strong><img alt="" src="http://i823.photobucket.com/albums/zz151/hagagatan/image001-29.png"></strong></p>
<p><strong>Net Private Sector Jobs January 2007 – December 2011, month-over-month change (000s):</strong><br /><strong><img alt="" src="http://i823.photobucket.com/albums/zz151/hagagatan/image001-27.png"></strong></p>
<p>As the historical record clearly shows, the economy has rebounded to pre-recession levels in both economic output and private sector job growth. Since NBER declared an end to the Recession (June 2009), the economy restored almost 700 billion in real GDP and has added a net 1,992,000 private sector jobs. Moreover, from January 2010 through December 2011, the business sector has generated net job growth of over 3,000,000 jobs. The partisan rhetoric simply doesn’t match the record.</p>
<p>(<em>I will comment in comments.)</em></p>

                                <p>NYT Robert Reich calls our attention to post election 2012 life and political realities:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.robertreich.org/">Looking Beyond Election Day</a>
<p>By Robert Reich, Robert Reich&#8217;s Blog</p>
<blockquote><p>Most political analysis of America’s awful economy focuses on whether it will doom President Obama’s reelection or cause Congress to turn toward one party or the other. These are important questions, but we should really be looking at the deeper problems with which whoever wins in 2012 will have to deal.
</p>
<p>Not to depress you, but our economic troubles are likely to continue for many years &#8211; a decade or more. At the current rate of job growth (averaging 90,000 new jobs per month over the last six months), 14 million Americans will remain permanently unemployed. The consensus estimate is that <a href="http://www.epi.org/publication/rate-job-growth-unemployment-rate-stay-disastrously/">at least 90,000 new jobs are needed just to keep up with the growth of the labor force</a>. Even if we get back to a normal rate of 200,000 new jobs per month, unemployment will stay high for at least ten years. Years of high unemployment will likely result in a vicious cycle, as relatively lower spending by the middle-class further slows job growth.</p>

                                <div></div>
<div>So today I read at the Yahoo Finance (it&#8217;s my home page because I can look at the stock numbers on the left and read the headline on the right for a guaranteed laugh) that  <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/daily-ticker/forget-wall-street-protestors-occupy-congress-mauldin-says-121137354.html?sec=topStories&#038;pos=main&#038;asset=&#038;ccode=">John Mauldin thinks the OWS</a> would be better off if they occupiedCongress:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Mauldin believes America still has time to figure out a path out of what he says is the big problem worldwide: &#8220;We&#8217;ve over committed public monies and we don&#8217;t have them.&#8221; While some what sympathetic to the protestors&#8217; frustrations, Mauldin says their anger is misdirected.</div>
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;My message to the &#8216;Occupy Wall Street&#8217; guys: if they really want to If  they really want to go after the source of the problem, they should go occupy Congress,&#8221; </div>
<div></div>
<div>Instead of focusing on Wall Street,Washington and the protests should be focusing on reducing regulation and making it easier for new businesses to start, Mauldin says. To that end, he offers a new slogan I somehow doubt will showup at any Occupy Wall Street protest anytime soon: &#8220;Up with Entrepreneurs&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>As I understand it, OWS is about economic equality. President Roosevelt referred to it as the economic royalty. I just don&#8217;t see how one can stop, look and listen to OWS and think &#8220;go tell congress to further deregulation&#8221;. John Boy can&#8217;t be this much of an idiot, can he?</div>

<div>For those who don&#8217;t know, we are the &#8220;Entrepreneurs&#8221; John Boy is referring to, thus we are paying for our health insurance, no dental. But, she was offered a payment plan. Has a nice dental name at 14.5% interest! This bit of private market solution to paying for health care is brought to you by GE Financial. Yes, the GE of Jeffrey Immelt, Obama&#8217;s job creating adviser. Hey Obama?

<blockquote><div>&#8220;During this period anarchists and socialists held protests on Wall Street out of a similar sense of frustration and rage at the banking system. The movement culminated in what was known as the greatest act of terrorism on American soil: the 1920 bombing outside J.P. Morgan and Company</div>
<div>Thirty eight people were killed when the horse and wagon bomb went off at noon on Sept 16, 1920. The perpetrators, thought to be anarchists, were never caught, but their exploits and the aftermath were captured by photographers.&#8221;</div>

<div>Why do we not hear about this history considering the present times? I know, stupid question. To ask it is to give purpose to OWS. Though one sector of this nation seems to remember a portions of this history or we would not be hearing the pejoratives being slung a the 99%&#8217;ers. You know Anarchists, socialists, communists out to destroy the American Way (A catchy phrase brought to you by the National Association of Manufacturers via General Food&#8217;s CEO, the US Chamber of Commerce and AT &#038; T&#8217;s monopoly is good all via Madison Ave,<a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,756746,00.html"> Time Magazine 9/28/1936</a>) .</div>

<div></div>
<div>Which brings me to <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/can-we-please-broaden-our-thinking-in.html">my original question</a> since the shit hit the fan: HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO DO THIS? HOW MANY FREAKIN&#8217; TIMES DO WE HAVE TO LEARN THE LESSON? </div>
<div></div>
<div>Obviously from the above 3 subtopics, quite a few more times as we seem to have not learned the definition of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2009/05/define-rich-part-ii-rat-race-and.html">Rat Race</a> yet: A rat race is a term used for an endless, self-defeating or pointless pursuit&#8230;</div>

<div>I think I know what is wrong with US today. When I typed in Deja Vu at youtube,  amazingly <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiDOMuhpqUo">this tune</a> did not even come up in the suggestion list. </div>
<p>No, I had to actually know that CSNY wrote what I consider the true musical capture of the concept of deja vu&#8230;the song that is most appropriate for the application of the concept today. I say this because they intentionally wrote the song so that it <i><u>does not</u></i> <i><u>repeat</u> </i>any one section (heard years ago in an interview).

                                <p><strong>UPDATE NOTE</strong>: The following isn&#8217;t complete.  Many of my notes from the latter part of today&#8217;s interview can be found on Twitter, hashtagged #Immelt. At the moment, I both (1) don&#8217;t have easy access to them and (2) have other things that need to be done.  Feel free to look there, and/or mention anything you want discussed here.)</p>
<p>The fake &#8220;news&#8221; of the day will be Immelt&#8217;s disparaging of America and Americans.</p>
<p>The semi-real news of the day will be that Immelt threw President Obama under the bus four or five times before finally saying that he &#8220;respects the President and respects the Presidency.&#8221; While this is progress from Jack Welch thinking that Buying George W. Bush the office meant that his firm would be exempted from cleaning up <a href="http://www.cleanupge.org/">the PCBs GE dropped into the Hudson River</a> (it did result in <a href="http://www.epa.gov/hudson/">a nine-year delay</a> and the likelihood that <a href="http://www.nrdc.org/water/pollution/hhudson.asp">taxpayers, not GE, will foot the large majority of the bill</a>), it&#8217;s not exactly a ringing endorsement of the man who gave us the <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2011/03/obamas-appointment-of-erskine-bowles-to-co-chair-his-deficit-commission-was-another-mammoth-unforced-error.html">Unforced Error</a> of <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2010/11/henry-aaron-really-does-not-like-simpson-bowles.html">Simpson-Bowles</a>.</p>
<p>Jeff Immelt, unlike Henry Aaron, believes that Simpson-Bowles is what we need for &#8220;growth.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff Immelt admits that, while the Board of Directors has some input, CEO pay is all about &#8220;getting what you believe you deserve.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff Immelt declares that if unemployment gets back down to 6%, no one will care about his being <a href="http://people.forbes.com/profile/jeffrey-r-immelt/36126">paid $21.5 million last year</a> (about 40% of which appears to be <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/business/index.ssf/2011/03/ge_ceo_jeffrey_immelt_saw_comp.html">an increase in his pension benefits</a>; other GE pension contributors <a href="http://www.pensionrights.org/blog/ges-deep-pension-freeze">haven&#8217;t been so fortunate</a>) to continue running GE <s>into the ground</s> to a standstill.</p>
<p>Jeff Immelt says that the US is 25th in math and 26th in science. (He&#8217;s wrong on the latter; we&#8217;re <a href="http://www.oecd.org/document/7/0,3746,en_21571361_44315115_46635719_1_1_1_1,00.html">17th</a>.) He then spewed some horseshit about the &#8220;crisis&#8221; of Germans believing that it&#8217;s easier to find skilled workers in Mexico than it is in the United States.</p>
<p>Why do I call this horseshit? Well, let&#8217;s look at <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/54/12/46643496.pdf">the two countries compared by Immeltian standards</a> (link is PDF):
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FZ1ZnKhc9zY/Tpw6iTq8vvI/AAAAAAAAAnM/W4UvMDl2Zi8/s1600/StupidGermans.PNG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FZ1ZnKhc9zY/Tpw6iTq8vvI/AAAAAAAAAnM/W4UvMDl2Zi8/s320/StupidGermans.PNG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>There are <s>two</s> three possibly-reasonable explanations. Either (1) there are a lot of Stupid Germans or (2) the places where Germans trying to hire are <a href="http://schoolfinance101.wordpress.com/2009/02/25/public-schooling-in-louisiana-and-mississippi/">Significant Laggard</a> or <a href="http://schoolfinance101.wordpress.com/2008/12/17/state-rankings-small-businesses-school-quality-and-economic-productivity/">&#8220;Business Friendly, School Crappy&#8221;</a> States.</p>
<p>Oops, or (3) the Germans pwnd Jeff Immelt, who then didn&#8217;t check the data.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s without noting that, if you adjust for demographic issues such as <a href="http://jerseyjazzman.blogspot.com/2010/12/international-test-score-comparison.html">poverty</a> or <a href="http://jerseyjazzman.blogspot.com/2010/10/competing-with-world.html">consider racial inequalities</a>, the U.S. is right at the top, no matter what Jeff Immelt says.</p>
<p>Otherwise, mostly, Jeff Immelt lies through his teeth, and Chrystia Freeland—who <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/conversation-with-george-soros.html">was tougher on George Soros last year</a>—lets him get away with saying it.</p>
<p>It is left as an exercise whether this is because her boss openly declaring this was going to be a powder-puff interview (&#8220;I&#8217;m a big fan&#8221; of <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/10/named-one-of-worlds-best-ceos-three.html">a man who has lost 60% of shareholder value for his investors over the past ten years</a>) or because she decided to let Immelt hang himself. (I know which way I&#8217;m betting.)</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/10/reids-plan-for-job-creation.html">Reid&#8217;s Plan for Job Creation</a>
<p>Harry Reid announced on Wednesday (Oct. 5) that the Senate would take up Jobs Act legislation (S. 1549) soon, but that the offsets in the president&#8217;s proposals would be replaced by a 5% surtax on those making more than a million that would raise about $445 million.  See Bolen &#038; Lorenzo, Senate to Debate Jobs Bill Paid For with 5% Millionaire Surtax, BNA Daily Tax Report 194 DTR G-7 (Oct 5, 2011).</p>
<p>Note that this means that, once again, Congress will punt on the question of taxing fund managers fairly on their compensation, since the carried interest provision would be one of the offsets replaced by this provision.  <a name="more"></a>  The carried interest provision should be passed no matter what other offsets are used.  It is an unfair provision that treats fund managers as a specially protected category of worker with preferential rates on their compensation income.  Time to end it, once and for all.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, GOP senator Hatch complained that this small surcharge on millionaires would be a &#8220;massive&#8221; tax increase on &#8220;small businesses&#8221;.  Id. How many times do we have to remind Congress that most small businesses don&#8217;t make millions in profits, that those who have millions can pay a 5% tax without undue distress (compared to those with a ten dollar bill being able to support their family with food and shelter), and that 5% of $1 million is not a &#8220;massive&#8221; tax increase.  50% of $1 million might be, but 5% is simply not.</p>

<p><strong>Jobs as the Measure of Economic Success, and Rick Perry&#8217;s Texas  </strong>
<p>We have had a warped sense of how to measure economic success in this country at least since George W. Bush started talking about the &#8220;ownership&#8221; society.  Of course, we should have guessed that moniker was problematic from the start, since it was &#8216;invented&#8217; by a guy who bragged about representing the &#8216;have-mores&#8217; while the economy was rapidly becoming a bi-polar, class-based society of have-mores and have-nots.</p>
<p>Most of the media looks at the gyrations of the Dow Jones Industrial, the S&#038;P 500 and similar indexes of stock pricess and then says our economy is good (if they&#8217;re up) or bad (if they&#8217;re down).</p>
<p>Folks, that&#8217;s only true for those who own most of the financial assets&#8211;the rich folks at the top of the scale.  It&#8217;s not true for the companies. As Ali Velshi noted in the Daily Show clip on the earlier blog post, companies intrinsic values don&#8217;t change by dropping 5% overnight, gaining 3% overnight and then dropping 4% overnight.  The companies are still plodding along doing what they&#8217;re doing.  What changes is the attitudes of those secondary investors&#8211;more and more of them just quick traders out to arbitrage a temporary price difference who don&#8217;t give a damn about the company&#8217;s fundamentals.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>Now, if you happen to own a few shares of a company that tanks, you clearly care about that stock price plunge.  And if your retirement account is large and heavily invested in stocks, then you care as well.  But fact is, the way we really should measure the economy is by how much and what kind of work it offers to ordinary Americans.  What&#8217;s the jobs count?  And what do those jobs pay?</p>
<p>And those numbers are important only relative to other numbers.  You don&#8217;t know whether you have a mice or an elephant in terms of job creation unless you know how much your population has grown alongside the growth of those jobs.  This is why the same record on job creation can be made to look good to the naive hearer  (&#8220;more than 5 million jobs in 8 years&#8221;) or terrible (&#8220;only 3 jobs per 1000 new citizens in 8 years&#8221;), depending on whether the hearer gets information on the number of new job seekers as well as the number of new jobs available for those seekers.</p>
<p>So Rick Perry brags about his Texas record.  I&#8217;ve already posted on the many problems in Texas, some of which Perry is responsible for and most of which he is responsible for not addressing.</p>
<p>What about jobs?  Yes, there is still an oil and gas &#8216;one-note&#8217; economy that creates directly and indirectly new jobs as the oil and gas industry grows (for now).  Many of those jobs are minimum wage and lots of them are not very secure.   But our question is what about the new jobs to new job seekers ratio&#8211;are jobs growing, so that unemployment is going down?  or are jobs growing but not at the same rate that the population is growing?    The fact that the unemployment rate has increased to just below the national average at 8.2% suggests that jobs aren&#8217;t growing as fast as the population and maybe that jobs are even shrinking.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s someone else&#8217;s take on this question.  The staff at ThinkProgress and the Center for American Progress Action Fund produced a report that delved a little deeper into the Texas jobs numbers and concluded: <a href="http://www.truth-out.org/texas-ranks-dead-last-total-job-creation-accounting-labor-force-growth/1313595007">Texas Ranks Dead Last in Total Job Creation, [when] Accounting for Labor Force Growth</a>, Aug. 17, 2011.</p>
<p>Here are a few facts from the report:</p>
<p>1) Between 2008 and 2010, jobs actually <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-16/massachusetts-beats-texas-as-unemployment-rises-less-rankings.html">grew at a faster pace in Massachusetts</a> than in Texas.</p>
<p>2) “Texas has done <a href="http://swampland.time.com/2011/06/13/rick-perry%E2%80%99s-jobs-problem-part-ii/">worse than the rest of the country</a> since the peak of national unemployment in October 2009.”</p>
<p>3) The unemployment rate in Texas has been steadily increasing throughout the recession.</p>
<p>4) While over 126,000 net jobs were created in Texas over the last two and a half years, the labor force expanded by over 437,000, meaning that overall Texas has added unemployed workers at a rate much faster than it has created jobs.</p>
<p>5) if there is a real “miracle” here, it is North Dakota, which has seen over 27,000 new jobs and a labor force expansion of only 3,700, resulting in about 24,000 new jobs for workers who previously had none.</p>
<p>The resulting picture comparing Texas to other states in terms of job creation considering labor force increase or decline is the following (note that Michigan&#8217;s &#8216;top&#8217; rating is due to some job creation but primarily to loss of labor force as people without jobs leave the state;  neither Michigan nor Texas has the &#8216;right stuff&#8217;)</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ll make this quick, since I&#8217;m going to get in trouble for writing on a national holiday. But the pace of annual jobs growth is too slow to generate strong wage and salary income. Much empirical research has been dedicated to the estimation of consumption functions, generally finding that labor income is the primary driver of consumption (here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2001/200109/200109pap.pdf">primer at the Federal Reserve Board</a>). However, by extension jobs growth is highly correlated with wage and salary growth, roughly 50% of personal income &#8211; this is the relationship I analyze here.</p>
<p>Roughly half of the <a href="http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/pi/2011/pdf/pi0511.pdf">BEA&#8217;s measure of personal income</a> comes in the form of wage and salary, so called labor income and simply referred to as &#8216;wages&#8217; from here on out. This is highly correlated with nonfarm payroll growth, both in nominal and real terms (92% and 79%, respectively, since 1996). The chart below illustrates the correlation between real wage growth and nonfarm payroll since 1982 (I use real wage so as to account for the effects of inflation).</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jCZR1i0ppjU/ThG01ErmhII/AAAAAAAADug/GFcm2gEmIys/s1600/payroll_rwage_chart.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jCZR1i0ppjU/ThG01ErmhII/AAAAAAAADug/GFcm2gEmIys/s400/payroll_rwage_chart.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />The annual pace of real wage gains and jobs growth have declined over time (jobs growth is measured using the nonfarm payroll). Simply eyeballing the data, there&#8217;s a structural shift roughly around 1996, as listed in the table below.</p>
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2ykpmwz2oP4/ThG2HXuFuPI/AAAAAAAADuo/KyS6SJkSS8A/s1600/table_wages_payroll.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2ykpmwz2oP4/ThG2HXuFuPI/AAAAAAAADuo/KyS6SJkSS8A/s400/table_wages_payroll.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>Using these two time periods, 1982-1995 and 1996-05/2011, I estimate a simple model of real wage growth on nonfarm payroll growth. The chart for the 1996-2011 model is illustrated below; and for reference, the regression results across both time periods are copied at the end of this post.</p>
<p>READ MORE AFTER THE JUMP!<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Note: I do not have time for a full blown econometric analysis. I did, however, perform statistical tests for serial correlation in the errors, unit roots in the transformed data (none), and general modeling tests.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xn1ePnaMRyc/ThHRWxhBKuI/AAAAAAAADvY/7c98PnelgRo/s1600/model_1996.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Xn1ePnaMRyc/ThHRWxhBKuI/AAAAAAAADvY/7c98PnelgRo/s400/model_1996.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a>I come to two general conclusions regarding the relationship between real wage growth and jobs growth over time:</p>
<p>(1) Real wage growth has become more persistent over time. In the first period, 1982-1995, just one lag was required to expunge the errors of autocorrelation. Spanning the second period, 1996-2011, three lags were required. The sum of the coefficients on the three lags is 0.87 in the later sample, or current wage growth is highly dependent on previous periods &#8211; sticky if you will.</p>
<p>(2) Nonfarm payroll growth has become less significant over time. Spanning the years 1982-1995, the coefficient on annual payroll growth was 0.27 &#8211; for each 1pps increase in the annual payroll growth, the trajectory of annual real wage growth increased by 0.27pps. The coefficient dropped to 0.17 in the sample spanning 1996-2011. This is probably a consequence of service sector jobs growing as a share of the labor market. I&#8217;d like your ideas in comments as well.</p>
<p>Clearly this is a very simple model but it does highlight that wages are likely stuck in the mud for some time. In May, annual real wages fell 0.6% over the year, having decelerated for 5 of the 7 months since November 2010. Real wages can pick up, but it takes time AND jobs growth faster than the 0.67% annual pace in May 2011.</p>
<p>Ultimately, what this analysis tells me is with wealth effects slowing markedly &#8211; the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=SPX:IND">trajectory of the S&#038;P</a> decelerated and house prices <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-06-28/home-prices-in-u-s-cities-decreased-4-in-april-from-year-ago.html">continue to fall</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s going to take a burst of payroll growth to get real wage and salary growth back on track enough to finance US domestic consumption. One caveat to all of this negativity is that <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=USCRWTIC:IND">oil prices are coming off</a> &#8211; this will boost real wage and salary growth directly.</p>
<p>Rebecca Wilder<br />P.S. I guess this turned out somewhat less &#8216;quick&#8217; than I had anticipated &#8211; not in trouble yet! Gotta go.</p>
