<p>The biggest growth difference appears to come from the U.S. period from the Second (1996) Clinton Tax Reform to the 2001 recession—a big if, I grant you, but one that the Gingrich/DeLay-led Republican Party predicted would produce mayhem, and the alternative-history is not difficult to imagine—I&#8217;m having trouble seeing where the losses are.  Especially if you consider that much of that time was spent <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/opinion/sunday/the-true-story-of-japans-economic-success.html">investing in increased infrastructure improvements and health care</a> that have the country well-positioned going forward.</p>

<p>Dan Becker:</p>
<blockquote><p>Mike Panzer at Financial Armageddon has been on the issue that the &#8220;street&#8221; is missing all that is going on around them. From his blog: http://panzner.typepad.com/</p>
<p>However, I wonder if a new paper, <a href="https://www2.blackrock.com/webcore/litService/search/getDocument.seam?venue=PUB_IND&#038;source=GLOBAL&#038;contentId=1111147677" target="_blank">From Keeping Up with the Joneses to Keeping Above Water: The Status of the US Consumer</a> from the BlackRock Investment Institute,</p>
<p>If long-term leverage sustainability is assumed to reside near 1990 levels, then the bulk of the deleveraging process remains ahead of the American consumer, regardless of the income measure used&#8230;</p>
<p>We think that these trends, coupled with stubbornly high unemployment, higher commodities prices, and slower growth in wages and salaries, will likely contribute to a lower level of personal consumption growth over the next few years. Moreover, since consumer spending is a key component of the GDP growth rate, this would argue for generalized economic growth levels that are, at best, modest for years to come, and may in fact appear anemic when compared to pre-crisis growth rates.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Spencer</strong></p>
<blockquote><p>I have believed for years that the US is following the Japanese model.</p>
<p>But note that while the general belief is that the Japanese government policy has not stimulated the economy, the alternative might very well (be the) belief that Japanese policy may be preventing a depression.</p></blockquote>

<br /></a>For years I&#8217;ve made it no secret that I thought the US was going to follow Japan into a so called lost decade &#8212; of course it&#8217;s now more than a decade.</p>
<p>With the US stock market now apparently in a free fall I though this chart I&#8217;ve been keeping for years would prove of interest. In particular, note how nicely the two stock market major  peaks and troughs seem to coincide.  Is it more than just an interesting coincidence?</p>
