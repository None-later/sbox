<blockquote><p>These days, China seems to play the same role in much of our discourse that Japan did two decades ago. We look at our own follies — which are immense — and then look at the Chinese, and ascribe to them all the virtues of foresight and determination we lack.</p>
<p>But just like the Japanese, the Chinese are human, and their policy makers are subject to the same kinds of confusion and inability to make hard choices that are part of the human condition. And Chinese macroeconomic policy is in the process of becoming a cautionary tale.</p>
<p>Basic economics says that by deciding to keep the renminbi undervalued, the Chinese put themselves <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/swan-songs/">under inflationary pressure</a>; and sure enough, inflation is rapidly becoming a serious problem.</p>
<p>But political considerations seem to be <a href="http://curiouscapitalist.blogs.time.com/2010/12/17/china%E2%80%99s-inflation-problem-and-the-perils-of-unconventional-policy/?utm_source=feedburner&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=Feed:+timeblogs/curious_capitalist+(TIME:+The+Curious+Capitalist)">ruling out all the reasonable responses</a>. They won’t revalue, because that would hurt politically influential exporters. They’re reluctant to raise interest rates, because that would hurt politically influential real estate developers. They’re trying to impose quantitative limits on credit, but are finding that borrowers have enough influence to circumvent the limits. And now they’re trying price controls — which will inevitably come apart at the seams unless they do something about the underlying pressures.</p>
<p>It’s an edifying spectacle.</p>
<p>Now, <em>schadenfreude</em> should not lead to any complaceny on our part; China may be corrupt and unable to make sensible short-run choices, but in terms of fundamental inability to deal with long-term problems, we still have them beat hands down. Still, it’s worth remembering that all giants have feet of clay.</p>

<p>Andrea Hayley writes: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/content/view/46986/">Chinese State-Controlled Market Policies Increasingly Unfavorable to the U.S.</a> in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theepochtimes.com/">The Epoch Times</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Deeply concerned about an unsustainable trade deficit with China, the chair and commissioner of the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (USCC) say that in order to compete with China’s state-controlled economic policies, the U.S. government needs to significantly shift its current market-based approach.</p>
<p>“A lot of our major competitors have game plans. The United States doesn’t have a game plan, and our people are suffering,” said Patrick A. Mulloy last Friday at the Center for National Policy.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />Mulloy, a USCC commissioner, and Daniel Slane, chairman of the commission, were keynote speakers of a talk, “Competing with China: How the U.S. Can Create Jobs in the 21st Century.”</p>
<p>The commissioners both said the U.S. free market system is at a disadvantage in our trading relationship with China, and that the government needs to take action to protect American interests at home and abroad.</p>
<p>Over the last nine years since China ascended to the World Trade Organization (WTO), it has amassed a $1.76 trillion trade surplus with the United States. The most common reason cited for the imbalance is China’s undervaluation of their currency, the RMB (yuan).</p>
<p>The House acted this September to pass a resolution raising the threat of import tariffs should China fail to raise the value of its currency to an appropriate level.</p>
<p>Related Articles<br />■China Blocks WikiLeaks <br />■China’s CPI May Have Been Intentionally Underestimated (Video)<br />While the currency issue is important, Mulloy said he doesn’t think it is the silver bullet. “I think the problem is a little deeper than that,” he said.</p>
<p>Mulloy is more concerned about the cumulative result of Chinese policies that require U.S. companies to exchange technology and know-how in exchange for access to their markets.</p>
<p>China’s industrial policies lure foreign companies to outsource production with offers of incentives, subsidies, and lower labor costs, and in order to take advantage of these lucrative offers, U.S. companies are required to transfer technology and know-how to the Chinese. This has been going on for years.</p>
<p>But recently, China has started asserting its economic muscle, and its companies are increasingly directly competing with U.S. companies, with China’s government policies granting domestic manufacturers the upper hand.</p>
<p>For example, China has started manufacturing commercial airplanes.</p>
<p>“China is going to make its own aircraft, and China is going to buy its own aircraft,” said Mulloy.</p>
<p>Recently, China’s indigenous policy has changed the playing field. Referred to in the USCC report as a &#8220;profound change,&#8221; the policy explicitly favors domestic companies over foreign firms for government procurement contracts.</p>
<p>One of the positive effects of China’s ascendance to the WTO, the ability of U.S. companies to make profits selling to China’s rising middle class, is not likely to pan out.</p>
<p>Slane sees current U.S. trade policy as a recipe for disaster. He recommends changes, such as replacing corporate income tax with a value added tax (VAT), an increase in research and development funding, and stronger patent protections with the goal of supporting U.S. manufacturing to balance the trade deficit.</p>
<p>Slane acknowledges that such changes would be “deeply disruptive to global commerce,” and lead to higher costs on goods purchased in the United States, but maintains it is a price Americans should be willing to pay.</p>
<p>“If we want to bring back manufacturing our government must acknowledge it is a new day in which other governments are practicing state-controlled capitalism, while we practice free market capitalism. It should be obvious that this is not a level playing field,” said Slane.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Dan here&#8230;Lifted with permission from an e-mail from Tim Worstall, an expert in rare earth issues and resources, in response to my sending him the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/business/global/23rare.html?_r=2&#038;ref=business">NYT article</a> suggesting China was using rare earth resources as both a trade issue (notice NYT suggestion the pass on processed product versus raw material export)) and political leverage with Japan using their detention of a Chinese fisherman. </p>
<p>by <strong>Tim Worstall</strong></p>
<p>In brief, the Chinese have just f**ked themselves over if the NYT take on the issue is accurate.</p>
<p>By showing that they&#8217;re willing to use RE supplies as a political lever they&#8217;ve just made them political for everyone else.</p>
<p>Thus there will be a political insistence that non-Chinese sources will be found.</p>
<p>It will make Mountain Pass&#8217; environmental problems easier to overcome, make funding Mount Lynas easier. It&#8217;ll make it more likely that I&#8217;ll get my grant to extract REs from the wastes of alumina  production (yes, it does work, we just don&#8217;t know whether it&#8217;s economic as yet, thus the grant).</p>
<p>Most importantly perhaps, it&#8217;ll make the politicians concentrate on what&#8217;s actually important here. REs aren&#8217;t rare but the ability to separate them is. There are any number of places around the world where I could scare up a few tens of thousands of tonnes of rare earth ores. Really, almost trivially simple.</p>
<p>However, separating them can take thousands (yes, really, thousands) of iterations of boiling them in hot acid. And when you&#8217;re done you&#8217;ve still got the thorium almost always associated with them to dispose of. So, politicians will have to accept that if they want windmills and electric cars then they&#8217;re going to have to allow people to play with boiling acids: and they&#8217;re going to have to find a repository for all that thorium (for it is radioactive, if only mildly so).</p>
<p>There is, other than the boiling acids thing, a possibility that we&#8217;ll go off and find another way of separating the rare earths. While there have been academic advances in this subject over the past 30 years there haven&#8217;t been any practical ones, no attempts to apply them. Why bother when China is doing it all for us? I could even tell you what one of the likely and useful methods to investigate is: but then I&#8217;d have to kill you as that&#8217;s the subject of my next grant application.</p>
<p>Finally, a political point. No, this doesn&#8217;t show that we must at all times maintain a domestic industry to do this or that for the fear that someone will start to play politics with our supply of this or that. We do have a few years ahead of some fairly serious amounts of money to be spent on getting RE supplies. But we&#8217;ve saved 30 years&#8217; worth of subsidy, a far larger sum, by not maintaining a domestic industry until we needed to.</p>
<p>For almost all commodities, metals, foods and so on, there are so many alternative sources we could develop if we needed to that no one can actually, in anything other than the short term, control our access to them.</p>
<p>If Chile started to use <em>tellurium</em> supplies as a political weapon then I might get a little more worried: anything else I just don&#8217;t see it being possible. And it&#8217;s certainly not a serious medium or long term threat to anyone other than the Chinese RE producers themselves that China is playing politics with the supply. All they&#8217;ve done is increase the funding available through political channels for the creation of alternative sources of supply. </p>
<p>Sensible advice to China would have been that if you want to start behaving like a monopolist you&#8217;d better make sure that you actually are a monopolist first. And they aaren&#8217;t, not over any reasonable timescale.</p>

<h4>Governor Jennifer Granholm of Michigan</h4>
<p>Michigan &#8211; “<a href="http://www.michigan.gov/nwlb/">No Worker Left Behind</a>,” which provides retraining for those downsized auto workers and others.</p>
<p>Escalation of high school curriculum so that graduating students must have taken college prep courses—has resulted in <em>reduction</em> in dropout rate because the community understands that this is a good thing for its students.</p>
<p>MI expects to create 89,000 jobs over the next decade in Alternative Energy—including the Lithium-Ion batteries that will power the hybrid and electric cars.</p>
<p>Governor Granholm states (recapitulation from last year) that Greenville, MI, “is determined to live up to its name” and expects to be able to sell alternative-energy generated (solar, wind, etc.) power to traditional companies.</p>
<p>Depend upon and expect to partner with private sector; strategic investment with the private sector has enabled Granholm to reduce the size of the State Government and maintain the state-constitutionally-required balanced budget. (Grants and Federal assistance in developing alternative energy have helped as well.)  “We can lead the world,” but are facing investment from the governments of China and Korea that are already investing billions (Korea just announced $12B investment) in developing those.  Granholm: “Would hate to see the development and design done here and the manufacturing done overseas.”</p>
<h4><strong>Rajiv Shah, US Agency for International Development (USAID)</strong></h4>
<p>Formerly of the Gates Foundation; father worked for three decade for Ford.</p>
<p>Almost every country that has emerged from extreme poverty did it by developing Ag and then moving away from an Ag-centric economy.  We know that Ag-lead development is three to four times more effective than “general GDP” growth.  If focus on Africa and South Asia, would (and do) know that this pathway needs to be enhanced.  Despite the efforts of such as AID, local and \</p>
<p>Speaks well of the Green Revolution.  (Muhammad Yunus, when I asked him about it at last year’s conference, was a touch more ambivalent about its success.)  Notes that the Green Revolution didn’t extend to Africa because “we just failed to try.”  Our agency (USAID) “has been as guilty as anyone”; real aid to Africa has declined by ca. 85%.  This has resulted in child malnutrition rates rising in those countries to a 30-40% range.  Ultimate result is that ca. 130MM people were moved <em>back into poverty.</em></p>
<p>Need roads; notes that Michigan has many “FM #” roads (Farm to Market).</p>
<p>USAID is investing in the countries that are putting out their own efforts to develop Ag economy; more interested in working with countries that work with them to develop new businesses, including those that add verticals to existing situation, such as processing coffee beans locally, instead of having them shipped and enhanced in developed countries such as Italy.</p>
<p>Very happy that USAID is not needed so much to provide direct food aid; prefers to facilitate development.  Most profound model is that of South Korea—which invested in agriculture and education and developed an export-led growth strategy.  Went from having lower GDP per capita than Kenya to being a member of (and, this year, the host of) the G-20.</p>
<p>Some specific developments are soybeans in Brazil that require less nitrogen (fertilizer) to grow.  Have great hope for Ghana, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Senegal—devoting resources to those countries in expectation of great returns.</p>
<p>Focused on reforming the procurement and investment mechanisms of USAID to make it easier to work with organizations such as the Gates Foundation and local NGOs. In the case of Haiti, developed a single form to clear all of the hurdles to approval that those local NGOs had never processed. There are many creative people in government who are employing the same entrepreneurial spirit to develop responsible and effective ways of improving resource allocation and expediting public-private partnerships to leverage the best features of both.</p>

                                <p>With thanks to <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/" target="_blank">Felix Salmon</a> for arranging the invitation.
<p>There’s an episode of <em>House </em>where he has to get rid of one of the people for his new team.  By the end of the episode, the sharpest person in the group has said everything that we would have expected to hear from House—and is therefore summarily dismissed, since hearing one’s own opinions being spoken by someone else is less useful than being challenged.</p>
<p>I had a similar feeling with George Soros’s conversation last Wednesday morning with Chrystia Freeland, sponsored by Reuters and held in the NASDAQ building that, er, graces Times Square. So what follows isn’t everything Soros said so much as what he said that either (1) you wouldn’t already know from reading this blog or Paul Krugman or (2) added details or touched on an interesting issue.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/20/soros-obama-and-me/">finds another similarity between himself and Mr. Soros</a>.</p>
<h4>The Recent Crisis and Its Causes</h4>
<p>Soros declares that there was twenty-five to thirty (25-30) years of a “Super Bubble,” which has now burst.  It seems from the discussion that Soros believes the SuperBubble was worldwide.  Recovery is being hindered by some policies—Germany’s talk about austerity was especially mentioned—by Soros sees strong hope in the Trade Shift that has accompanied the crisis. He noted that the “global economy is a lot better than the US economy,” and that he expects to see it continue growing even if the U.S. (or Europe, due to the German leadership, or even both) fall into a :double-dip.” (In this he is arguably more of an optimist than many.)</p>
<h4>China I</h4>
<p>Key to this shift has been the growth of bilateral relationships.  He noted obliquely that these developed in part because many governments—most especially the Chinese, who have been “the great beneficiary of globalization”—do not want to change their capital controls, but sees them as facilitating the new paradigm. He expects that the next move will be that Hong Kong (with the HKD remaining independent of the RMB) will become as London did in the 1960s and 1970s, the intermediary of choice for the growing market (now China, then Europe).</p>
<p>There is a strong need to increase Chinese domestic demand, which he rightly expects is being partially facilitated by the recent wage increases. While there is a need to shift from the previous US-Chinese symbiotic relationship (essentially, bonds for exports), Mr. Soros is “not sure there will be” further advancement in that relationship without greater domestic Chinese consumption. He declared that the Chinese economy has become “the motor” of the world economy, but also noted that it is a smaller motor, so the world economy is not moving so fast.</p>
<h4>Currencies</h4>
<p>In that context, he was asked by a gentleman from Fidelity Capital if it is time to move from the USD to a “basket” as the World Reserve Currency. (As regular readers know, this is an issue near and dear to my heart.) Stating the obvious, Soros noted that having “a more neutral currency” (which may not be an exact quote) would be helpful in correcting the imbalances, which are largely due to the dollar being the International Reserve Currency. He agreed that a basket Reserve Currency would improve the market. (I—and I suspect <a href="http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">David Beckworth</a>—might agree that it would provide for easier <em>remedies</em>, but I’m not convinced it would provide for a better market, since arbitrage opportunities and issues of asymmetric information would be more likely to skew outcomes.)</p>
<h4>China II</h4>
<p>Soros is very sympathetic to the Chinese people themselves.  He notes that they work hard but that their labor is harnessed to an undervalued currency to the benefit of the State. He described the Chinese mercantile system as being “State Capitalism,” which he calls a “very powerful” model, while also noting that it is not so good as the previous “International Capitalism.” Since he noted that “International Capitalism”; is synonymous with “the Washington Consensus,” this leaves him having damned China with very faint praise.  (Though, in fairness, he is even more negative about Russia, which he described to Jim Holt as an example of <em>unsuccessful </em>State Capitalism, whose success or failure is primarily driven by the price of oil. He also sees a real possibility of China developing into an Open Society—another point on which he is rather an optimist.)</p>
<p>Where he is not positive about China is its Real Estate market, which is skewed in part due to the political structure. The Chinese version of mercantilism allows government officials to own three (3) properties, which has been a very good way for those workers to get rich through selling and “trading up.”  The primary solution to this bubble, he believes, would be initiating a property tax, which would produce a carrying cost on properties and therefore mitigate the speculative aspects of the bubble. (Soros essentially notes that, as with the United States, labor is overtaxed and capital undertaxed in China.  Since China has excess productive labor, the benefits flow to the state.  Implicitly, the U.S.’s excess produced the differential model discussed above, which worked well for both parties for some fifteen (15) years.)</p>
<p>But all is not  bread and roses in Soros’s view of China.  An Indian journalist sitting next to me asked the obvious question: Has being a democratic country “hamstrung” India as compared to China? Soros came back to his key theme of the need for growth in Chinese domestic demand, noting that the Indian economy is more stable precisely because there is now domestic growth—growth that will be facilitated in China only as that State evolves both politically and economically. He noted that the Chinese people, to date, have been willing to accept limits on their individual freedom for its benefit in growth, but he does not see other countries being willing to accept such limits on their own freedom to support China’s growth.  If I ever had any doubt that Soros is a more devoted Popperian than I, it was eliminated in that moment.</p>
<h4>Other Powers, and Some That Might Be</h4>
<p>Soros spoke positively of Turkey (Dani Rodrik <a href="http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/rodrik48/English" target="_blank">may have a counterpoint</a>), negatively of Germany (from a policy perspective; when asked by a reporter from Crain’s what we will look back on and see as stupid, he replied that “fiscal rectitude, from a timing point of view, is wrong.”), and generally positively of the Euro, declaring in response to a question about Ireland and Greece that “If anybody would leave [the Eurozone] it would be Germany.”</p>
<p>His key point about the Euro is one that is often found in the literature of financial crises, including the previous Great Depression: there is a European Central Bank, but there is not a central Treasury. But this appears to be <em>de facto</em> being remedied by the Solvency Crisis, with “back-up funds” being developed and used.  Soros noted a key distinction that is often missed in discussions: there was not a crisis of the EUR, but rather a European <em>banking</em> crisis, which was exacerbated by policy disagreements between France and Germany. (Germany won, though his view of whether this victory will be relatively Pyrrhic is left as an exercise.)</p>
<p>Again, he looks to the Chinese as an indicator, who started putting their money—you know, that 4 Trillion RMB stimulus and the revenues that have followed it—into the EUR as soon as it reached around 1.20.  The Chinese bought the EUR, the Chinese bought Spanish bonds, the Chinese stabilized the market.  The Chinese did something no one else can do for them—bought another currency on the open market.</p>
<p>And this is the key to understanding Soros’s attitude toward Japan. You think this is easy, realism? The Japanese are correct to worry about their currency, Soros notes, because, while the RMB is the strongest currency in the world, you cannot own it because of capital controls that the Chinese government maintains because they do not want to have both rising wages and an appreciating currency in their export-based economy. Accordingly, per Soros, any appreciation of the RMB “has to be done in an orderly manner.” In the meantime, the Japanese did the only thing they could.</p>
<h4>U.S. Politics</h4>
<p>Mr. Soros was by no means a fan of the Obama Administration. Echoing Glenn Greenwald, he notes that the Obama Administration should have corrected the excesses, the abuse of power, of the Bush Administration. Despite this (and what follows), Soros believes Obama “may well be elected to a second term.”</p>
<p>As a matter of handling the banks through the crisis, Mr. Soros noted that the Administration should have injected Equity into the banks, but notes that he believes the Obama team found this politically unacceptable. The result is that the government effectively nationalized the banks’s <em>liabilities</em> and “allowed” them to “earn their way out of that hole,” through practices such as increasing consumer credit card rates.</p>
<p>(My memory of the events is somewhat different, since part of what the Fed received for its TARP funds were warrants on those banks—warrants that have subsequently been sold and counted as if the revenue against the original loans to make them appear more “profitable” in the eyes of several bloggers and financial journalists [including, for instance, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/why-do-i-predict-tarp-less.html" target="_blank">Robert</a>]. But certainly there was no AIG-like structure imposed, no U.S. equivalent of Northern Rock, no matter how much saner than would have been.)  </p>
<p>To no one’s great surprise, Mr. Soros does not believe that Mr. Obama is “anti-business.”</p>
<p>The biggest fault he found with the Administration’s approach to the crisis is that they depended on the “confidence multiplier” to make recession shallower and shorter than it otherwise would have been. The problem with a <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/01/blanchard_roundtable_1" target="_blank">confidence multiplier</a> is, of course, that when the results do not match the expectations, the “multiplier” becomes a disappointment, and therefore a drag on expectations going forward. Mr. Soros described this as what happened.</p>
<p>If this scenario is true, then the decision not to ask initially for a $1.2T stimulus, with a chance to end up with a better mix and higher absolute amount of actual stimulus funding, will go down as the tombstone for the Administration, not “just” a spanner in <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/09/20/obama-raises-prospects-of-new-economic-team/" target="_blank">the possible continuation of the Administration’s economic team</a> (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/" target="_blank">Mark Thoma</a> on <a href="http://twitter.com/MarkThoma" target="_blank">Twitter</a>).  But, hey, the recession <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/current-doldrums-are-just-jobless-sales.html" target="_blank">has been over for more than a year</a>, so things are getting better, with the upcoming elections more resembling the signpost of 1982 than 1932.  At least in some timestream.</p>
<h4>Gold</h4>
<p>This one was pulled all over the place, so it should come as no surprise.  Gold is, per Mr. Soros, the only active “bull market” right now.  He is also not optimistic about the ending of that market. Gold is “the ultimate bubble”—may be going higher, but is certainly not safe and is not going to be forever.</p>
<p>Mr. Soros admits a similar attitude toward oil, but at least there the commodity has intrinsic value. As Vincent Fernando, CFA, notes, owning something other than gold at least gives you the possibility of “<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/gold-owner-vs-business-owner-2010-9" target="_blank">productive assets</a>.”</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>I’ve left out a few things, including the roundelay that resulted when one journalist attempted to discuss Mr. Soros’s firm’s holdings in a company he said he didn’t the firm owns. But in general the feeling one gets when presented by Mr. Soros the person is that he is an optimist, perhaps incurably so. Things are rough, and they will probably continue to be rough for a while, but in the longer term, things are getting better for all.</p>
<p>I’m guessing he won’t be speaking at <a href="http://www.keepfearalive.com/" target="_blank">The March to Keep Fear Alive</a>.  But Mr. Colbert—let alone his predecessor at the Washington Monument—would do well to book him as a guest.</p>

<p>Stormy asks in an e-mail:  At one time, I thought America was supposed to lead the way in green technology, providing jobs for Americans&#8230;and sends this quote from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/07/AR2010090706933.html?wpisrc=nl_pmheadline">Washington Post</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The last major GE factory making ordinary incandescent light bulbs in the United States is closing this month&#8230; <br />&#8230;<br />What made the plant here vulnerable is, in part, a 2007 energy conservation measure passed by Congress that set standards essentially banning ordinary incandescents by 2014. The law will force millions of American households to switch to more efficient bulbs. <br />&#8230;<br />The resulting savings in energy and greenhouse-gas emissions are expected to be immense. But the move also had unintended consequences. <br />&#8230;<br />Rather than setting off a boom in the U.S. manufacture of replacement lights, the leading replacement lights are compact fluorescents, or CFLs, which are made almost entirely overseas, mostly in China.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, let&#8217;s see. The article seems to imply a whole story- Environmental concerns pushed closings and lost American jobs, which was not forseen, and those awful Chinese somehow wound up with the manufacturing.</p>
<p>The <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ibew.org/articles/09daily/0908/090810_GEShutdown.htm">IBEW notice</a> adds a bit to the story:</p>
<blockquote><p>The news stunned Lexington Local 1627 Business Manager David Butcher, who represents 114 workers at the plant. “I knew there was trouble but that was the last thing I expected to hear,” he said.  </p>
<p>That local had recently negotiated an agreement with the company to help reduce costs by agreeing to a wage freeze and flexible overtime regulations, hoping to buy more time so GE could update its facilities to be more competitive.</p></blockquote>
<p>And then this <a target="_blank" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/15/AR2010091507173.html">article</a> points to our responses on trade.  It describes the next generation  after flourescent technology of lighting using <strong>LED technology</strong>.  </p>
<p>The Federal government either has no role to play in trade policy to benefit its own citizens according to free trade enthusiasts, or possibly is only part of a short term &#8216;stimulus&#8217; package for green technology. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2010/09/one-obligation-to-increase-shareholder.html">Bottom line decisions</a> on how and where to do business are global in nature without regard to your role as a citizen.  Admired from afar it all looks good, but how do you voice a concern for where you belong. </p>
<p>As indicated in the article the role of suggesting incentives has been traditionally a function of municiple and state governments, leaving individual trade agreements with countries to the federal government.</p>
<p>Pay special attention to the notion that the national government of China is offering help to locate a manufacturing site in Mexico with the help of the national Mexican government. And that the current employees to manufacture new light bulbs are drawn from former government employees (NASA).</p>
<p>The national narrative on trade bears little resemblance to the reality of doing business from this point of view.  When listening to speeches it is best to keep this in mind.</p>

I have not done the calculation, but this will generate a significant downward revision of the second quarter real GDP report.  Remember, BEA does not have this data when they do the first GDP report.</p>
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGKhUsWxQAI/AAAAAAAABTA/FfITssfLHFU/s1600/Clipboard02.bmp"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_Zh1bveXc8rA/TGKhUsWxQAI/AAAAAAAABTA/FfITssfLHFU/s320/Clipboard02.bmp" alt="" border="0"></a>The plunge was driven by a 5.2% jump in real nonpetroleum imports although petroleum imports also rose 1.9%.  Since the May 2009 bottom, real nonpetroleum imports have risen some 31.9%.  Real petroleum imports are up 8.9% over the same period.  Real exports fell 1.6% and as the charts makes obvious they have been flat in recent months &#8212; they are actually down 1.5% from their March 2010 peak.  This should force forecasters to significantly revise their growth forecast down as what looked like a strong rebound in exports late last year now appears to be faltering.</p>

<p>Firedoglake presents a well written piece on US and Chinese trade policy:</p>
<p><a href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/11/22/china%E2%80%99s-industrial-policy-vs-us-random-behavior/">China’s Industrial Policy vs. US Random Behavior</a></p>
<blockquote><p>The <a href="http://www.uscc.gov/index.php">U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission</a> has issued its <a href="http://www.uscc.gov/annual_report/2009/annual_report_full_09.pdf">annual report</a> {giant .pdf}. Robert Borosage of the <a href="http://ourfuture.org/">Campaign for America’s Future</a> hosted a conference call for the Co-Chair of the Commission, Carolyn Bartholomew, and Clyde Presotwitz of the <a href="http://www.econstrat.org/">Economic Strategy Institute</a>, who was U.S. Trade Representative under Reagan. The call offered these experts an opportunity to talk about China’s industrial policy.</p>
<p>Prestowitz said something that focused the entire issue for me. He pointed out that labor is not a significant factor in chip manufacture. Why then are so many chip manufacturing facilities located in China? He says it’s because the Chinese wanted these as part of their industrial policy, so they seized the land, built the infrastructure, provided low-cost loans, granted energy and water subsidies, trained a work force, and gave the manufacturers tax breaks. Now they offer more subtle incentives, funding for research and development, refunds of the value added tax and space in industrial parks. As Prestowitz said, the plants are there for financial reasons.</p>
<p>This is Chinese policy. They want to grow their economy by attracting foreign capital and foreign technology. They intend to maintain state control over crucial industries.</p>
<blockquote><p>China’s overall industrial policy … is characterized by three main parts: (1) the creation of an export-led and foreign investment-led manufacturing sector; (2) an emphasis on fostering the growth of industries such as high-technology products that add maximum value to the Chinese economy; and (3) the creation of jobs sufficient to reliably employ the Chinese workforce, thereby allowing the Chinese Communist Party to maintain control.</p></blockquote>
<p>Many Chinese subsidies violate the requirements of the World Trade Organization, and the US has sought sanctions, but the Commission says that the WTO rules are meant to deal with narrow issues, not the broad national practices of China. The WTO rules require consultations as well as litigation, and even after a victory, they are able to delay. By the time the US and Canada won a WTO ruling barring favoritism in manufacture of auto parts, many manufacturers had moved production to China, so those jobs were lost.</p>
<p>Don’t think that we will be able to compete with our high tech products. China uses industrial policy to achieve technology transfer. Here’s an example from the call. China had not mastered several crucial issues in the manufacture of jet propulsion blades.</p></blockquote>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Several thoughts come to mind:</p>
<p>1. Appeals to the notion that command economies fail is not re-assuring at best and grossly misleading at worst. Since 1992 Chinese leaders took a different turn from our old notions of &#8216;command&#8217; economies of cold-war stories. </p>
<p>2. China is wrenching a pre-industrial economy into the 21st century, at a speed that is breathtaking. The US is struggling with shedding 20th century notions of what we think we are&#8230;</p>
<p>3. There is no reason to think that &#8216;green shoots&#8217; industries are assured in the US as a jobs policy. Such industry building is already occurring in China (and Germany).</p>
<p>4. We insist China re-direct its drive to a domestic consumer orientation, and talk about how the government deliberately keeps the economy as an export platform, but if many times more money is made currently exporting due to high prices for exports than if sold domestically, would you change direction in a hurry? Who is getting the bargain overall? Many Chinese businesses are still learning new standards. </p>
<p>5. Chinese leaders are taking a big gamble. And Chinese society is taking a big hit overall, with great disruption in people&#8217;s lives. The US is also experiencing great change&#8230;slower perhaps, but we haven&#8217;t really accepted the fact nor figured out that we have change to no matter what.</p>
<p>6. Some of the unease on right and left is due to some sort of view of this change. Is it along the lines we are used to, and/or simply myopic?</p>

<p>From the NEWS.com.au Australian :<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,26151111-38196,00.html?from=public_rss">news service</a><br />

<p>PAPUA New Guinea tribesmen have demanded an apology from American political satirists who used their traditional dress in a witchdoctor slur against US President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>In the offending image, a headshot of Mr Obama was superimposed on a photograph of a PNG Highlands region man in full traditional costume, supposedly to portray the black President as an African witchdoctor.</p>
<p>Damien Arabagali, Hela Gimbu Association chairman, said PNG&#8217;s Foreign Affairs Minister and Cultural Minister would have to take up their demand.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>HGA lawyer Alfred Kaibe, who wore his traditional Hela costume when sitting as a member of Parliament in 2001, said his people did not see the funny side.</p>
<p>&#8220;It borders on racism, to us and the US President,&#8221; he said.  &#8220;The connotation is this type of dress is for witchcraft&#8230;This is our traditional costume; we are proud of it.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another HGA member suggested that if no apology was forthcoming the $16 billion ExxonMobil liquefied natural gas project based in the region could be jeopardised&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, maybe not.  But <a target="_blank" href="http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/programguide/stories/200803/s2202160.htm">maybe</a>.</p>
<p>
<blockquote>Good prospects of reopening Bougainville copper mine.<br />There are &#8216;positive prospects&#8217; for reopening the Panguna copper mine in Papua New Guinea&#8217;s Autonomous Bougainville province, with local landowners planning a major reconciliation. The mine was closed nearly 20 years ago during a secessionist conflict led by the late Francis Ona, which was sparked by landowner issues and environmental damage caused by the mine&#8230;&#8230;The Bougainville conflict that broke out in 1989, when rebels under the leadership of the late secessionist, Francis Ona, attacked the mine workers and installations over environmental pollution they alleged the mine was causing.</p>
<p>The mine was abandoned, and thousands of Bougainvilleans died in the subsequent civil war before a peace accord was reached in 2001.</p></blockquote>
<p>Words and images have power, and not just in the intended direction .  It doesn&#8217;t seem likely that the offensive images fostered by the American tea partiers will have force enough to reach around the world and effect the business dealings of ExxonMobil&#8230;</p>
<p>But they might.</p>

<p>And, indeed, space upstairs maxed one. It&#8217;s 3:40; Barack H. Obama is scheduled to speak in about twenty minutes, though I might bet that it will start late, since everything else has. (You try scheduling a meeting with two Presidents, the current leaders of Chile and Australia, and the Presidents of Wal-Mart and Coca-Cola—and that&#8217;s just the scheduled Plenary speakers—and not have things run late.)</p>
<p>The food is very good, and the teas are good (and all too useful), though they have run out of lemon.</p>
<p>Hoping the second session (leaders of three more countries—Turkey, the Netherlands, and Argentina—; security has been amazingly efficient and polite) and the head of the IMF to present.</p>
<p>The Really Good Stuff starts tomorrow.</p>
