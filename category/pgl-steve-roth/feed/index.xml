<p><a href="http://www.asymptosis.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/SCF-2010-net-worth.png">Steve Roth</a>&#8216;s chart to 2010 from <i>Asynptosis</i> demonstrates the drop in net worth for most of us.</p>
<p><a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2013/03/so-whose-wealth-is-at-record-high.html" target="_blank">pgl at <i>Econospeak</i></a> adds perspective:<br />
<blockquote>So Whose Wealth Is At a Record High?</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p><a href="http://news.msn.com/us/us-household-wealth-regains-pre-recession-peak">This news story</a> must be good news for some folks:<br />
<blockquote>According to the Federal Reserve, household wealth amounted to $66.1 trillion at the end of 2012 and further gains in stock and house prices have allowed Americans to make up for the losses incurred during the recession.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you want to protest that not everyone has recovered their lost wealth, the story sort of concedes this further down:<br />
<blockquote>The recovered wealth — most of it from higher stock prices — has been flowing mainly to richer Americans. By contrast, middle class wealth is mostly in the form of home equity, which has risen much less.</p></blockquote>
<p>Households owners&#8217; equity in real estate peaked at $12.5 billion in 2005 and then plummeted. While it has partially recovered, it was only $8.2 billion at the end of 2012 according to the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1">Flow of Funds Accounts</a>. Given that consumer prices have risen by almost 20 percent over this period, our equity in real estate is still far below its 2005 peak value.</p></blockquote>
