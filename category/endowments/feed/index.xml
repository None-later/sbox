				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/03/sallie-mae-couldnt-have-predictedmodel.html">Rdan&#8217;s Sallie Mae</a> post I got the urge to hunt because vtcodger mentioned greed.</p>
<p>Greed?  Yes, I have recently learned that one person who works to manage the endowment fund for Harvard got a bonus for last year performance that was less than the year before of $2M.  Imagine that!  The endowment is so large and produced so much, that $2m could be handed out like a tip.  (Of course, this is second hand knowledge.)</p>
<p>So let us see how Harvard is doing. <br />The fund is currently valued <a href="http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/08.23/99-endowment.html">at $34.9 Billion</a>.<br />
<blockquote>Harvard Universityâ€™s endowment earned a 23.0 percent return during the fiscal year ending June 30, 2007. <br />From fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2007, for example, scholarships and awards to students from University funds increased by over 94 percent, to $302 million from $156 million. Endowment dollars distributed for overall Harvard programs rose more than 70percent during the same period, from $615 million to $1.04 billion. </p></blockquote>
<p>$1.04 billion or 3%.  Only 3%. Yet:<br /><em>Since its inception, HMC has averaged an annualized rate of return of 13.3 percent.</em></p>
<p>The industry average is: <em>the median for the 151 large institutional funds as measured by the Trust Universe Comparison Service (17.7 percent), as well as the 20.9 percent that marks the top 5 percentile.</em></p>
<p>Granted, I&#8217;m sure and as they say there are restrictions.  However, Harvard says they are trying to spend 5% annually.   They note tuition only covers 2/3 of the cost.   Well if they really tried to get to that 5%, they would have another $705 million for it.  At <a href="http://www.fao.fas.harvard.edu/cost.htm">their tuition </a>of $47,215, that&#8217;s 14,932 students.  The <a href="http://www.stateuniversity.com/universities/MA/Harvard_University.html">total enrollemnt</a> is only 25,017 including part-timers. </p>
<p>Hello?</p>
