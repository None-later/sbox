                                <p>Almost a week ago—a few decades of Internet time, when people could still believe House Republicans might be sane—Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/the-tarp-plan.html">quoted the summary</a>:<br />
<blockquote>To provide authority for the Federal Government to purchase certain types of troubled assets for the purposes of providing stability to and preventing disruption in the economy and financial system and protecting taxpayers, and for other purposes&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>As noted, this was back before &#8220;other purposes&#8221; included cutting down more trees in Oregon or providing mental health benefits as part of insurance. So let&#8217;s just focus on the word that makes this facility different: <strong>purchase</strong>.</p>
<p>And let&#8217;s put that $700,000,000,000 in a context (figures in $Billions):
<p><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SOhASv2RflI/AAAAAAAAAKA/9VPG1QQCt7A/s1600-h/majorbanks.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/SOhASv2RflI/AAAAAAAAAKA/9VPG1QQCt7A/s400/majorbanks.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>So we could buy four of the largest banks and the three somewhat-remaining large Investment Banks with change left over.</p>
<p>But that wouldn&#8217;t get market lending started again.</p>
<p>Will buying securities?</p>

                                <p>&#8230;even though we certainly need some bailing out.</p>
<p>Brad Setser <a href="http://blogs.cfr.org/setser/2008/10/02/give-the-fed-a-bit-of-credit/">notes the obvious</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Frankly the TARP is now starting to look small relative to the Fed’s balance sheet.</p></blockquote>
<p>while including the reality:<br />
<blockquote>The latest [H.4.1] data release should settle the question; absent enormous liquidity support from the Fed, a much broader set of financial institutions — including some that received equity investments from sovereign wealth funds — would have failed.</p></blockquote>
<p>Which just brings us back to the question: if the TSLF, PDCF and related entities are doing their job—and there is no indication they are not—what will be the benefit of TARP?  (That is, if I can <a href="http://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/tslf_terms.html">loan a security to the TSLF for 28 days</a>, and roll it over indefinitely [or at least until I get the price I want in the market], why would the Fed need to buy it, and why would I need the Fed to buy it?)</p>
<p>Continuing the thought, via Setser, <a href="http://www.iie.com/issues/009.htm">Morris Goldstein lays out the four major issues of the current credit crisis</a> [reformatted]:
<ol>
<li>illiquidity for certain mortgage-backed securities,</li>
<li>undercapitalization of the financial sector,</li>
<li>an interruption in the flow of credit to households and nonfinancial businesses, and </li>
<li>a rising foreclosure rate that threatens to produce a downward overshooting of housing prices.</li>

<p>The first is a problem for the same reason that GM not selling too many Hummers is a problem: it&#8217;s where the profits were made.  Those &#8220;radioactive&#8221; tranches that were mostly sold to hedge funds were the most profitable part of the MBS.  The argument that it isn&#8217;t so much a liquidity problem as a price problem (demand is significantly down, and prices rarely go up in those circumstances) may be viable, but that leads to:</p>
<p>The second problem, some portion of which was a direct result of Christopher Cox&#8217;s mismanagement of the SEC&#8217;s oversight of investment banks, not to mention a lot of off-balance sheet maneuvering that ended up impacting bottom lines.  This is addressed fairly well by the TSLF, PDCF, etc.  But the problem persists, which leads to</p>
<p>The third problem, or the crux of the matter, without which we wouldn&#8217;t see <s>the former head of Goldman Sachs making plans to reward his friends</s> the Treasury Secretary talking about how overvalued assets are &#8220;undervalued&#8221; (assuming they reach maturity without high default rates) and need to be bought for two years, after which time all will presumably be fine and dandy again,* unless&#8230;</p>
<p>The housing market oversells (this point has been well-covered by AI <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/vacancy-http://www.blogger.com/post-edit.g?blogID=5048766&#038;postID=3327095655018485471%3Cbr%20/%3EBlogger:%20Angry%20Bear%20-%20Edit%20Post" the other reason we may not have needed ...>here</a>).</p>
<p>So if we look at the four points, the optimistic version is that the bailout bill will form a &#8220;hedge fund&#8221; for the &#8220;radioactive&#8221; portions of MBSes that no one else is buying. (<strong>UPDATE</strong>: Daniel Gross <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2201340/?from=rss">made the same argument at Slate</a> (h/t <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/10/links-for-200-1.html">Mark Thoma</a>).)</p>
<p>And we know this will work because hedge funds, as the Wall Street Journal editorial page keeps reminding us, are all doing fine, or at least not getting splashed across the front page of the Wall Street Journal when they fail.</p>
<p>The just appear in the FT and Bloomberg with graphic descriptions of them eating each other <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/10/hedge-funds-preying-on-weak-peers.html">&#8220;because &#8216;investors have been unwinding trades that they otherwise believe make sense&#8217;.&#8221;</a></p>
<p>In the end, as Hilzoy noted, the saving grace of the bailout bill may well be its unfunded mandate that FDIC insurance be increased to $250,000.</p>
<p>The other problem, as even <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/economic-policy.html">Martin Effing Feldstein</a> <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122307486906203821.html">notes</a>, is the part of the bill that was sacrificed early: relief for homebuyers:<br />
<blockquote>The financial rescue plan would bring back the confidence needed to revive the financial system only if the Treasury&#8217;s asset purchases could eliminate the current impaired securities now held by the financial institutions, and if the remaining securities could be counted on to remain healthy. The legislation will do neither.</p></blockquote>
<p>But supporting the structures on Main Street itself, as noted <a href="http://bitchphd.blogspot.com/2008/09/bailout-for-beginners.html">here</a>, was sacrificed early:<br />
<blockquote>I think that the&#8230;bit of your crisis just got buried on a big news day. They gave up on support for low-income home owners as part of the negotiations. That was an expensive objective</p></blockquote>
<p>The alternative may well be worse, especially if Goldstein is correct about the fourth part, which strongly implies that Feldstein will be correct about the securities based on those properties.</p>
<p>*It&#8217;s scary when the cynical version of events makes more sense than the official story.  Does anyone really believe that the MBS market will be recovered in two years, when the TARP programme is scheduled to end?  If so, on what evidence?</p>

                                <p>by Ken Houghton</p>
<p>Prefatory Note: I wrote this several hours ago, but we had enough great posts this morning from <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/whats-wrong-with-economic-theory-as.html">Robert</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/employment-situation.html">Spencer</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/few-questions-about-taxes.html">cactus</a>, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/national-childrens-study.html">rdan</a> that I scheduled it instead of posting directly.  In the interim, the House approved the second bailout bill, which I am already <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-not-to-build-bailout-proposal.html">on record as opposing</a>, for reasons similar to those of YouNotSneaky!:<br />
<blockquote>So after voting &#8220;no&#8221; before, enough lawmakers might now vote &#8220;yes&#8221; on the new bailout plan because:</p>
<p>1. Mental health provisions in insurance plans.<br />2. State and local sales tax deductions.<br />3. Subsidies to rural counties<br />4. Relief for victims of natural disasters<br />5. Business tax breaks<br />6. Energy subsidies</p>
<p>&#8230;[W]hat 1-6 above have in common is that</p>
<p>THEY HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON WITH THE FINANCIAL CRISIS!!!!!!!</p></blockquote>
<p>So, just for the record, I&#8217;m not posting this now out of &#8220;sour grapes.&#8221;  Just so that we have a record of <strong>why</strong> the bailout was a bad idea to begin with.</p>
<p>I was wrong.</p>
<p>There are conditionals I could put around that, but, really, why bother?  I read the press releases, and quick-skimmed through the bailout bill itself on Monday, trusted Paul Krugman&#8217;s &#8220;hold your nose and support it&#8221; analysis, and hoped for the best.</p>
<p>I forgot Daniel Davies&#8217;s Three Laws.  (Well, actually, I didn&#8217;t, but I hoped Chris Dodd&#8217;s efforts weren&#8217;t in vain.)  I forgot that the only exception to the &#8220;left the Bush Administration with a positive reputation intact&#8221; rule was Douglas Holtz-Eakin, (who just waited until he joined the presumptive Next Administration to go into the tank).</p>
<p>But I forgot the fundamental rule of economics: mechanism design has to be done well, or the idea will just be economic theory that &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/10/whats-wrong-with-economic-theory-as.html">depend[s] on assumptions which no one claims are approximately valid</a>.&#8221;**</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s review the assumptions under which the bill made at least some form of sense:
<ol>
<li>There was only going to be $250B taken in the first round, which would (by Paulson&#8217;s own description) provide financial until the next Congress was in place and could readdress the issue.</li>
<li>There would be oversight so that the Secretary of the Treasury (Paulson [GS], Gramm [UBS], etc.) couldn&#8217;t just reward his friends and punish his enemies.</li>
<li>The bill required <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/tarp-draft.html">equity compensation for overpriced securities</a>. (Not a great deal, but a gain from a poke in the eye with a sharp stick.)</li>
<li>The bill included changes to the compensation model that (let&#8217;s be nice) encouraged risk-taking where the bill came due on the next watch.</li>
<li>The compensation changes were also supposed to ensure that the current leadership—the people who drove these companies to the point of insolvency, that is—would not receive the monies and just pay themselves bonuses all out of proportion to performance.</li>
<li>There was never going to be a direct $700B economic gain from the stimulus package. That the proposal came out of Treasury told us that.  Some of the monies were going to go to &#8220;shoring up&#8221; firms that didn&#8217;t need it.</li>
<li>Even with that, monies that did get allocated optimally would have a multiplier effect, so you should get more than $700B in stimulus from them alone. (<a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/how-to-think-ab.html">Brad DeLong estimated $500B</a>, but that was based on E(loss) around $100B.  Even his worst case—$400B loss—would imply an $875B economic gain even in the event of a $700B government loss.  It&#8217;s not good budgeting, but it is a stimulus)</li>
</ol>
<p>That was the bill as presented.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/09/mussolini-style-corporatism-in-action.html">Yves Smith discovered the reality</a>, and, while I&#8217;m late to the party, I&#8217;ll join the piling-on:<br />
<blockquote>1. The tranching is a mere formality, and the Treasury boys as much as said so. They could take the $700 billion max as soon as the bill has passed,</p>
<p>2. However, they do not plan any action immediately, will wait a couple of weeks. They want to focus their efforts on stronger companies but also made noise about protecting the financial system. This, by the way, is the Japanese convoy system all over.</p>
<p>3. There seemed to be a lot of tap dancing about what price they will pay for assets and no straight answer about their policy on warrants. They did say that if the amount sold was greater than $100 million, they would take warrants. FYI, the current draft allows them to pay up to the price at which the assets were initially booked (yikes) . I wonder if this is obfuscation, if they have an idea of what the plan to do but will not admit it in any public forum.</p>
<p>4. As the person who listened to the call stressed, DealBreaker wasn&#8217;t clear on the bifurcated process. If you come to the Treasury and you are in trouble, you get reamed. Bear/AIG style treatment, execs probably fired. But if you participate on a voluntary basis, the intent is to make it very user friendly. That is consistent with Paulson&#8217;s position during the negotiations.</p>
<p>5. The exec comp provisions sound like a joke, They DO NOT affect existing contracts, they affect only contracts entered into during the two years of the authority of this program and then affect only golden parachutes. More detail on that point, but I don&#8217;t need more detail to get the drift of the gist.</p></blockquote>
<p>and that reform to executive compensation only exists for the <em>official</em> time of the program:<br />
<blockquote>Market mechanism: if sell over $300M into fund, some exec comp limits<br />come with it. For 2 years, the firm could not enter into NEW contracts<br />including golden parachute, for involuntary departure. And lose some<br />deductibility.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that undermines completely assumptions 1-5 above, leaving us with a poorly-targeted bill that does nothing to address the credit crunch (in a positive way, that is; negative implications discussed below the fold).</p>
<p>Ms. Smith later noted that <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/10/bailout-bill-to-make-money-market.html">her readers argue, probably correctly, it will make things worse</a> [numbering added to emphasize sequential nature of events]:<br />
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Fed as only lender, in an attempt to keep the financial system from imploding;</li>
<li>TARP needed to keep Fed balance sheet intact so that it can continue as only lender;</li>
<li>Treasury will need to significantly increase the amount of Ts (public money) auctioned to fund TARP;</li>
<li>Panic serves to encourage T. buyers, especially for bills;</li>
<li>This represents a liquidity trap: TARP recipients of Ts will hoard cash to buy Ts: rinse and repeat.</li>
<li>This results in drying up of lending to corporations/crowding out private capital &#8211; no new credit lines.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>And that has become <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/10/breakingviews-bailout-bill-to-worsen.html">the groundswell opinion</a>, <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/10/credit-crunch-worsens-libor-spikes.html">with which the market appears to agree</a>.</p>
<p>So, even initially, we were left with a stimulus package that won&#8217;t save any firms, will support those who don&#8217;t need it, may well remove liquidity from the market at a time when it is desperately needed, and where none of the reforms that would ensure that this wouldn&#8217;t happen again.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing left.  Follow the DeLong/<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122282719885793047.html">Phelps</a> recommendation and nationalize the lot.</p>
<p>*Its not, by the way, that I&#8217;m not still sick.  It&#8217;s that when you can&#8217;t tell whether the character on the page is a dot, a carat (^), or a tilde (~), it&#8217;s time to take a break.  Which has mean reading some blogs that didn&#8217;t fit the bandwidth a few days ago, with Firefox set to an increased text size.<br />**I could pick nits here and note that many of the theories can be considered valid if they are trivial, but is that really an argument <em>for</em> theory?</p>

<p>Paul Krugman <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/opinion/03krugman.html?_r=1&#038;ref=opinion&#038;pagewanted=print&#038;oref=slogin">presents the optimistic version</a>*:<br />
<blockquote>The House will probably vote on Friday on the latest version of the $700 billion bailout plan — originally the Paulson plan, then the Paulson-Dodd-Frank plan, and now, I guess, the Paulson-Dodd-Frank-Pork plan (it’s been larded up since the House rejected it on Monday). I hope that it passes, simply because we’re in the middle of a financial panic, and another no vote would make the panic even worse. But that’s just another way of saying that the economy is now hostage to the Treasury Department’s blunders.</p>
<p>For the fact is that the plan on offer is a stinker — and inexcusably so. The financial system has been under severe stress for more than a year, and there should have been carefully thought-out contingency plans ready to roll out in case the markets melted down. Obviously, there weren’t: the Paulson plan was clearly drawn up in haste and confusion. And Treasury officials have yet to offer any clear explanation of how the plan is supposed to work, probably because they themselves have no idea what they’re doing.</p>
<p>Despite this, as I said, I hope the plan passes, because otherwise we’ll probably see even worse panic in the markets. But at best, the plan will buy some time to seek a real solution to the crisis.</p></blockquote>
<p>It won&#8217;t be that good.</p>
<p>More later, but the relevant quote of the week comes from <a href="http://www.breakingviews.com/2008/10/02/Tarp's%20economic%20implications.aspx?sg=breakingstories">Martin Hutchinson at Breaking Views</a> (h/t <a href="http://www.nakedcapitalism.com/2008/10/breakingviews-bailout-bill-to-worsen.html">Yves Smith</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Herbert Hoover’s Reconstruction Finance Corporation of 1931-32, which made loans to politically connected companies, didn’t do much to alleviate the Great Depression. An equivalent amount of welfare handed out through the “Veterans’ Bonus”, which Hoover opposed, might have boosted consumption and stabilised the economy more quickly.</p></blockquote>
<p>*Or, if you prefer, the von Clausewitz version, &#8220;Any positive action, <em>even if ultimately wrong</em>&#8230;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Let the Rich Bail Them Out. So says <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=303980">Bernie Sanders</a>, now the Independent, junior senator from Vermont, formerly the &#8220;longest serving independent member of Congress in American history&#8221;&#8211; sixteen years.</p>
<p>Bernie makes some <a href="http://www.sanders.senate.gov/news/record.cfm?id=303980">cogent points</a>:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>This bill does not effectively address the issue of what the taxpayers of our country will actually own after they invest hundreds of billions of dollars in toxic assets. </p>
<p>This bill does not effectively address the issue of oversight because the oversight board members have all been hand picked by the Bush administration. </p>
<p>This bill does not effectively deal with the issue of foreclosures and addressing that very serious issue, which is impacting millions of low- and moderate-income Americans in the aggressive, effective way that we should be. </p>
<p>This bill does not effectively deal with the issue of executive compensation and golden parachutes. Under this bill, the CEOs and the Wall Street insiders will still, with a little bit of imagination, continue to make out like bandits.</p>
<p>This bill does not deal at all with how we got into this crisis in the first place and the need to undo the deregulatory fervor which created trillions of dollars in complicated and unregulated financial instruments such as credit default swaps and hedge funds. </p>
<p>This bill does not address the issue that has taken us to where we are today, the concept of too big to fail. In fact, within the last several weeks we have sat idly by and watched gigantic financial institutions like the Bank of America swallow up other gigantic financial institutions like Countrywide and Merrill Lynch. Well, who is going to bail out the Bank of America if it begins to fail? There is not one word about the issue of too big to fail in this legislation at a time when that problem is in fact becoming even more serious.</p>
<p>This bill does not deal with the absurdity of having the fox guarding the hen house. Maybe I&#8217;m the only person in America who thinks so, but I have a hard time understanding why we are giving $700 billion to the Secretary of the Treasury, the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, who along with other financial institutions, actually got us into this problem. Now, maybe I&#8217;m the only person in America who thinks that&#8217;s a little bit weird, but that is what I think.</p>
<p>This bill does not address the major economic crisis we face: growing unemployment, low wages, the need to create decent-paying jobs, rebuilding our infrastructure and moving us to energy efficiency and sustainable energy. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Bernie comes to the crux of the matter:<br />
<blockquote>There is one issue that is even more profound and more basic than everything else that I have mentioned, and that is if a bailout is needed, if taxpayer money must be placed at risk, whose money should it be? <i>In other words, who should be paying for this bailout which has been caused by the greed and recklessness of Wall Street operatives who have made billions in recent years?</i> </p></blockquote>
<p>Before answering this rhetorical question, Bernie calls our attention to a few unsavory facts:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Over the last seven and a half year, since George W. Bush has been President, 6 million Americans have slipped out of the middle class and are in poverty, and today working families are lining up at emergency food shelves in order to get the food they need to feed their families. </p>
<p>Since President Bush has been in office, median family income for working-age families has declined by over $2,000. </p>
<p>More than seven million Americans have lost their health insurance. </p>
<p>Over four million have lost their pensions. Consumer debt has more than doubled. And foreclosures are the highest on record. Meanwhile, the cost of energy, food, health care, college and other basic necessities has soared. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then Bernie asks: Who, in the last seven years, made the money&#8211;and how much did they make?<br />
<blockquote>
<p>For the first seven years of Bush&#8217;s tenure, the wealthiest 400 individuals in our country saw a $670 billion increase in their wealth, and at the end of 2007 owned over $1.5 trillion in wealth. </p>
<p>In our country today, we have the most unequal distribution of income and wealth of any major country on earth, with the top 1 percent earning more income than the bottom 50 percent and the top 1 percent owning more wealth than the bottom 90 percent. </p>
<p>CEOs of Wall Street firms received unbelievable amounts in bonuses, including $39 billion in bonuses in the year 2007 alone for just the five major investment houses.</p>
<p>We have seen the incredible greed of the financial services industry manifested in the hundreds of millions of dollars they have spent on campaign contributions and lobbyists in order to deregulate their industry so that hedge funds and other unregulated financial institutions could flourish. </p>
<p>We have seen them play with trillions and trillions dollars in esoteric financial instruments, in unregulated industries which no more than a handful of people even understand. </p>
<p>We have seen the financial services industry charge 30 percent interest rates on credit card loans and tack on outrageous late fees and other costs to unsuspecting customers. </p>
<p>We have seen them engaged in despicable predatory lending practices, taking advantage of the vulnerable and the uneducated. We have seen them send out billions of deceptive solicitations to almost every mailbox in America. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hard to argue with Bernie. Eh? And now his solution:<br />
<blockquote>
<p>I proposed to raise the tax rate on any individual earning $500,000 a year or more or any family earning $1 million a year or more by 10 percent. </p>
<p>That increase in the tax rate, from 35 percent to 45 percent, would raise more than $300 billion in the next five years, almost half the cost of the bailout. </p>
<p>If what all the supporters of this legislation say is correct, that the government will get back some of its money when the market calms down and the government sells some of the assets it has purchased, then $300 billion should be sufficient to make sure that 99.7 percent of taxpayers do not have to pay one nickel for this bailout. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do like Bernie&#8217;s style and his thinking. I am not sure his 10% hike would really solve the credit problem at this point. It would, however, help make the bailout itself more palatable for the rest of us. It might also be a signal that we are about to get serious about the kind uncontrolled greed that has gotten the green light from those who should know better.</p>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>I posted this <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/2008/10/bailing-furious.html">in comments</a> at <a href="http://lancemannion.typepad.com/lance_mannion/">Lance&#8217;s place</a>, but figure to run it up the flag here as well.</p>
<p>Speaking as one who supported Monday&#8217;s bill and generally opposes today&#8217;s, here&#8217;s the high-level list of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It wasn&#8217;t going to authorize the whole $700B, but about$250B, with renewal (or scrapping) to follow.  (That Henry Paulson was an idiot in his pitch, and that that pitch has been perpetuated to the detriment of sanity, was <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/stan-collender/555/what-we-have-here-failure-communicate">documented by Stan Collender</a>.)</li>
<li>Even a broken clock is right once or twice a day.  Yes, the administration cried &#8220;Wolf,&#8221; but the tense of your post is incorrect—banks are <em>already</em> not loaning to creditworthy entities.</li>
<li>What made it worse is that about two weeks ago, they decided not to loan <em>to each other</em>.  Or to do so only at (relatively) ridiculously high rates.</li>
<li>Subnote of the above:  My HELOC is currently somewhere between 3.75 and 4.75%.  Which means that I could borrow $25K or $50K or $100K on it, invest that money at LIBOR, and <em><strong>make a profit</strong></em>.  That&#8217;s the type of thing I mean when I say the markets are too out of kilter.  The market seems to believe that I am a better credit than, say, Citigroup.</li>
<li>They may be right.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the bill itself:
<ol>
<li>Krugman is right.  It&#8217;s not good—the current &#8220;pitch&#8221; is economically inaccurate; George W. Bush was more correct than Henry Paulson on what would work—but it was probably the best we were going to get as a bipartisan effort.</li>
<li>There were conditions in it that should have ensured, on balance, that the taxpayer ended up with a significant equity participation in the firms that were saved.  (Dodd&#8217;s addition: 1.25(Y-X) in company stock for every dollar lost between the purchase and the final sale, was inspired.)</li>
<li>There were restrictions—not so strong as I&#8217;d like, but restrictions at least—on the bailout monies going to the high-level execs who have mismanaged those firms for the past several years.</li>
<li>If it&#8217;s not a bipartisan effort, then the Republicans are going to hang it on the Democratic Party for the next 34 days, even though their people are the ones who said it was necessary.</li>
<li>Given (1) and (4), the alternative when the bill failed was one of two things: (a) take the <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/time-not-for-a.html">Brad DeLong approach</a> or (b) introduce a ill that <strong>looks like</strong> a bill that <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_09_28_archive.html#4958501322080983185">Democrats would support</a>: fund infrastructure, extend unemployment benefits, put more money in the hands of people who are (to borrow a phrase) &#8220;liquidity constrained&#8221;—that is, the people who will <em>spend</em> it.  It will end up in the same place—on some bank&#8217;s balance sheet—and have at least done some good.  And then <strong>dare</strong> Republicans to veto—or run against—the bill.  (Fairness note: Domenici&#8217;s addition in the Senate fits well in that group.)</li>
<li>They didn&#8217;t do either of those.  They made it a bill that appeals more to the Republican money-base&#8217;s interest, and does even less for the credit crisis than the previous one did.</li>
<li>I realise the essence of the argument is &#8220;Wasting $400B or so of a $700B bill is all right, but wasting $500-550B of an $850B bill isn&#8217;t.&#8221;  But the original bill was, as Krugman noted, <em>marginally</em> acceptable.  The current one is well over the margin and into &#8220;unfunded giveaways that won&#8217;t support the economy or increase the velocity of money.&#8221;</li>
<li>That last point is essentially the argument of <a href="http://www.sabernomics.com/sabernomics/index.php/2008/10/a-smart-move-by-lohse-and-boras/">J. C. Bradbury in discussing Kyle Lohse&#8217;s new contract</a>: you could have a mediocre deal today, or a better one later.  Since it&#8217;s only going to get worse over the next few weeks, the chances of getting a better deal by waiting only go up. But apparently Hillary Clinton and Harry Reid decided not to go that way.</li>
</ol>
<p>Which, I would argue, is a mistake.</p>

<p>But I do want to make it clear that, if I get a call the day after the election (from either party), I will move back down and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/its-all-fun-in.html">accept this job</a>.</p>

<p>Is there any evidence in the text that this is true?  The closest I can find is:<br />
<blockquote>After forgoing premiums from 1996 to 2006, the agency must now turn to struggling banks and ask them to pay more, putting more pressure on the industry. If a large number of banks fail, the F.D.I.C. may have to turn to the Treasury for more money, forcing taxpayers to foot the bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;It’s unfortunate that we didn’t have more time to build up the fund in the good times,&#8221; said Sheila C. Bair, the F.D.I.C. chairwoman, in an interview Wednesday. &#8220;It is what is, and we are dealing with the situation.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
