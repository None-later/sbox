<p>I don&#8217;t believe David Leonhardt is an idiot, but that&#8217;s not based on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/business/24leonhardt.html?ref=business&#038;pagewanted=print">the evidence at hand</a>:<br />
<blockquote>There are really only two [questions]: What steps are most likely to solve the immediate crisis? And how can the long-term cost to taxpayers be minimized?</p>
<p>Everything else — reducing executive pay on Wall Street, changing the bankruptcy laws, somehow slowing the descent of home prices — is either a detail or a distraction.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let me say this slowly, so even a NYT reporter can understand it: If you are taking an equity stake in a firm, one factor is how much cash the firm will have on hand.  Cash paid to executives is not cash on hand, nor can it be used to produce future capital, investments, and free cashflow, or even &#8220;the miracle of compound interest.&#8221;  So executive pay is very much a factor in equity calculations.</p>
<p>Changing the bankruptcy laws is more tangential, but let&#8217;s again explain this slowly. Mortgage-backed securities are, well, backed by <em>mortgages</em>.  Their value depends directly on those payments.  If it becomes easier to workout a mortgage in bankruptcy court, the holders of those MBSes are liable to (1) receive a higher value and (2) know sooner how severely their securities are impaired.  So changing the bankruptcy law will, again, make the value of the assets clearer sooner.  <em>Which is especially important if we&#8217;re all going to pretend that this thing is going away after two years.</em>*</p>
<p>Slowing the descent of home prices—well, that&#8217;s a second-order effect, so I&#8217;ll agree with him there.  Or at least let it ride.**</p>
<p>His next paragraph, however, is incomprehensible:<br />
<blockquote>Usually, it would be easy enough to dismiss these sideshows as the inevitable gear-grinding of democracy. This is an extraordinary time, though. The credit markets are nearly dysfunctional, leaving the economy at risk of falling into a downturn unlike any most of us have lived through, and the government is about to commit billions of dollars after only a week of political debate. There&#8217;s no time to waste. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s be clear: the government (meaning here the Executive Branch and the Federal Reserve, controlled and run by Republicans) has <em><strong>already</strong></em> committed billions of dollars over the past six months. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/900-billion-for-you-citizennever.html">Maybe $900,000,000,000</a>. During the entire time of which, Mr. Paulson was (1) certain the crisis was over and (2) working on the <s>idiocy</s> plan that he presented.</p>
<p>Leonhardt&#8217;s very next sentence undermines his previous paragraph.<br />
<blockquote>The first thing to understand is that a bailout plan doesn’t have to cost anywhere close to $700 billion, so long as it’s designed well. [italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the plan that included absolute authority for the Secretary of the Treasury, and of which the Secretary of the Treasury said, &#8220;No, I&#8217;m not asking for absolute authority,&#8221; right?  I would again invoke Daniel Davies&#8217;s Three Laws, but Leonhardt wants us to believe that this time will be different, if the plan is well-designed.***<br />
<blockquote>Figuring out how much to pay for the assets is the first problem. The drop in house prices and rise in foreclosures have made it clear that these securities are worth considerably less than banks expected. But there is enormous uncertainty about how much less.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s why we have a market, no?  (Clearly, the answer will be &#8220;no.&#8221;)<br />
<blockquote>Based on the underlying fundamentals (like the current foreclosure rate and the one forecast for the future), many of the securities appear to be worth something on the order of 75 percent of their original value. But thanks to the fear now gripping the market — not necessarily an irrational fear, given that most forecasts have proven far too sunny over the last year — very, very few of those securities are trading hands. Among those that have, the sales price has been roughly 25 percent of the value. [I italicized, but he blocked it off in the first place; the bold is mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>So the market has a price, but Mr. Leonhardt wants us to believe that these securities could be worth three times as much.</p>
<p>Assume I do.  What should I be willing to pay for those securities? And what would I offer for them?</p>
<p>Now assume several of us believe that.  What will be we do?  Well, I&#8217;ll offer the current market price, Tom will offer 25.5, Robert will go 26, and pretty soon we&#8217;ll own all we want somewhere around 65.****</p>
<p>So where are the hedge funds and investment managers and new Vulture Funds?  Who believes these securities are worth 75?  Surely, they are willing to bid 25, 26, even 30.  Mr. Leonhardt doesn&#8217;t tell us.  In fact, the people who know the market best—Barack Obama&#8217;s classmate, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/trickle-down-in-action.html">Tom Marano</a>, for instance—are retrenching, even after the first $900,000,000,000 in liquidity has been added.<br />
<blockquote> Which price is the government going to pay?&#8230;[I]t probably can&#8217;t pay 25 cents. That might fail to fix the credit markets, because it would do relatively little to improve financial firms’ balance sheets. Firms might then remain unwilling to lend money to businesses and households, which is the whole problem the bailout is meant to solve.</p></blockquote>
<p>Oh, wait.  I thought that list of side considerations above were unimportant; now it turns out they&#8217;re &#8220;the whole problem the bailout is meant to solve.&#8221;<br />
<blockquote> The most obvious solution is to pay more than 25 cents on the dollar and then demand something in return for the premium — namely, a stake in any firm that participates in the bailout. Congressional Democrats have been pushing for such a provision this week, and it’s one of the most important things they have done.</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s nice to know.  Too bad it wasn&#8217;t in the original &#8220;well-designed&#8221; plan.  I guess David Leonhardt believed Dick Fuld when he said he, er, gave at the office, too.<br />
<blockquote>The government would then be accomplishing three things at once. First, it would take possession of the bad assets now causing a panic on Wall Street. Second, it would inject cash into the financial system and help shore up firms’ balance sheets (which some economists think is actually a bigger problem than the bad assets).</p></blockquote>
<p>There&#8217;s a link to Krugman&#8217;s column on Monday omitted here.  But let&#8217;s look at what Leonhardt has just done:
<ol>
<li>He has admitted they are &#8220;bad assets,&#8221; while before they were just underpriced.</li>
<li>He has declared that it would &#8220;inject cash into the financial system,&#8221; rather ignoring (again) the previous $900,000,000,000 than the Fed has &#8220;injected&#8221; in lieu of easing rates further.</li>
<li>He has invoked &#8220;balance sheets,&#8221; for discussion of which I refer you to <a href="http://macroblog.typepad.com/macroblog/2008/09/the-left-and-ri.html">David Altig</a> (h/t <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/09/22/financial-one-liner-of-the-day?tid=true">Felix</a>)</li>
</ol>
<p>But the best is yet to come.<br />
<blockquote>And, third, it would go a long way toward minimizing the ultimate cost to taxpayers.</p></blockquote>
<p>Overpayment is good because we&#8217;ll get more back.  And I thought only Health Economics had an upward-sloping demand curve.<br />
<blockquote>Why? The more that the government overpays for the assets, the larger the subsidy it’s providing to Wall Street — and the more it is pushing up the share prices of Wall Street firms. As Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, notes, the equity stakes allow the government to recapture some of the subsidy down the road. It’s a self-correcting mechanism.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s a good thing Leonhardt opened his piece by noting that Congresscritters don&#8217;t know much about the financial markets, but, really, couldn&#8217;t we expect more from Economics writers?******<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Hey, Jack, if you pay me three times what this asset is worth in the market, I&#8217;ll give you an extra fifty cents six years from now.&#8221;<br />&#8220;Sounds like a great deal to me, Lloyd. And that writer in the Times thinks so too.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So far, we have established that Paulson presented a plan that, if it had been well-designed, would be great.  So who is at fault?  Why, Congress, of course:<br />
<blockquote>Instead of a laserlike focus on the big issues, though, Congress has been devoting a good chunk of energy to secondary matters. Some of the proposals, like changing bankruptcy rules to help some homeowners avoid foreclosure, are perfectly reasonable but just won’t do much to cure the credit markets. Others may not even meet that standard.</p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s try this again. Homeowners who avoid foreclosure can, unlike those who don&#8217;t, pay their mortgage. Which monies flow to (wait for it) Mortgage-Backed Securities.  Which then gain value and can be sold at a higher price.  So, if you really want to reduce the cost of the bailout, keeping people out of foreclosure seems as if it would help. A lot more than seeing a stock price appreciate later, as was suggested <s>in that well-designed plan</s> <em>by Chris Dodd, Barack Obama, and Congress</em>.</p>
<p>And then Leonhardt just outright jumps the shark:<br />
<blockquote>One of the fashionable ideas of the week, supported by both Democratic leaders in Congress and John McCain, is to limit the pay of top executives at any Wall Street firm that sells assets to the government. </p></blockquote>
<p>Not even CNN fell for that one completely, despite their <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/09/23/campaign.wrap/index.html">idiotic headline</a>:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;Contrary to the lies told by the McCain campaign, it was John McCain who followed Sen. Obama&#8217;s lead in laying out principles that call for strict oversight and accountability, protecting taxpayers and cracking down on CEO pay. We only wish he had adopted those same principles over the last 26 years rather than cheerleading for the deregulation agenda that helped produce today&#8217;s crisis and repeatedly opposing limitations on the obscene compensation given to failed CEOs.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And it doesn&#8217;t take a long use of The Google (well, I just went to Brad DeLong&#8217;s site) <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/barack-obama-pr.html">to find, from Sunday night</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Rescue requires mutual responsibility. As taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary steps to protect our financial system, it is only appropriate to expect those institutions that benefit to help protect American homeowners and the American economy. We cannot underwrite continued irresponsibility, where CEOs cash in and our regulators look the other way. We cannot abet and reward the unconscionable practices that triggered this crisis. We have to end them. [italic mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s rather clear, no?  Not to Leonhardt, who tries one last time:<br />
<blockquote>And in a frenzied week, any time spent on talking about C.E.O. pay is time not spent on designing the toughest possible bailout package.</p></blockquote>
<p>Give you a hint, David.  Pass a large portion of the firm&#8217;s revenues to Dick Fuld or Hank Greenberg or Vikram Pandit and there won&#8217;t be any effing stock appreciation for you to claim to have &#8220;reduced the cost&#8221; in the end. Even the Chamber of Commerce knows this.</p>
<p>*Brought to you by the administration that expected its Iraq Adventure to last six days, maybe six weeks at most.<br />**In the context, I&#8217;m inclined to argue, under that same &#8220;two year&#8221; timeframe, that they should want to accelerate the decline in prices.  As a current seller, I object, though.<br />***For starters, it was designed to be initiated and run by a man who is unlikely to be in that same position six months from now.  That this might be an elementary design flaw seems to have escaped Mr. Leonhardt.<br />****The extra ten is because we are not so stupid as Mr. Leonhardt, on whom someone pulled &#8220;75&#8221; out of his backside.  No, we bid 65 because we know there is substantial uncertainty in that &#8220;75,&#8221; and we pulled &#8220;65&#8221; out of our backside.*****<br />*****Robert is now trying to figure out a correlation matrix for this.<br />******Ben Stein and Robert Samuelson always excepted.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/garbage_pail_/2008/09/a_krugmanite_tweak_to_the_dodd_plan.php">don&#8217;t know</a>, and am asking.  My initial thought is not so much, because the Dodd contingency looks pretty tough (why it&#8217;s generally been favorably received in the econoblogiverse) assuming it makes it into a bailout law:<br />
<blockquote>3) VESTING OF SHARES.—If, after the pur-<br /> chase of troubled assets from a financial institution,<br /> the amount the Secretary receives in disposing of<br /> such assets is less than the amount that the Sec-<br /> retary paid for such assets, the contingent shares re-<br /> ceived by the Secretary under paragraph (1) shall<br /> automatically vest to the Secretary on behalf of the<br /> United States Treasury in an amount equal to—<br /> (A) 125 percent of the dollar amount of <br />  the difference between the amount that the Sec- <br />  retary paid for the troubled assets and the dis- <br />  position price of such assets; divided by<br /> (B) the amount of the average share price<br /> of the financial institution from which such as-<br /> sets were purchased during the 14 business<br /> days prior to the date of such purchase.<br />[Emphasis added.]</p></blockquote>
<p>So when the &#8220;G. W. Bush Memorial Fund&#8221; sells a Troubled Asset at a loss, the shareholders in the firm that dumped the Troubled Asset pay the Treasury 125% of the loss in equity.  In effect, the Fund a la Dodd provides liquidity while privatizing the losses, which is a 180-degree turnaround from the original Treasury proposal.  Dodd seems to have brought a BFG to a knife-fight.  (Though I wonder if the above section could use a contingency for the case in which 125% of the Troubled Assets&#8217; losses exceeds the equity in the firm.)</p>
<p>In fact, I think the difference in taxpayer exposure with the original Paulson trial balloon can hardly be overstated.  In the original plan, the taxpayer&#8217;s losses were limited mainly by how rapidly Treasury chose to liquidate securities for which it overpaid and the overall Federal debt limit.  Dodd&#8217;s modification ostensibly makes the taxpayer&#8217;s cost of the bailout the opportunity cost of setting up the fund and providing the liquidity.  One might think our foreign funders might be happier to absorb that cost than to fund a huge chunk of socialized losses.  Keep that in mind as we hear the Richard Shelbys of the world announce their supposedly principled opposition.</p>
<p>On a somewhat related note, I recommend this post of <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/garbage_pail_/2008/09/the_market_for_lemons_and_the_garbage_pail_agency.php">Mark Kleiman</a>&#8216;s as crystallizing a thought I&#8217;d had after reading <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/moral-philosoph.html">this one of DeLong&#8217;s</a>.  When I hear talk of &#8220;overpaying&#8221; for assets, I ask relative to what — patient money ought to be able to profit from a panicked market (i.e. which will not pay a &#8216;rational&#8217; price for risk).</p>
<p>Added: <a href="http://mithras.blogs.com/blog/2008/09/how-the-equity.html">Mithras</a> catches that if the Fund&#8217;s acquisition of a seller&#8217;s Troubled Assets doesn&#8217;t stop the seller&#8217;s share price from collapsing following the sale, then the Fund can rack up big net losses in the liquidation.  <s>However, as I read the Dodd draft Mithras&#8217;s Secnario 3 would trigger the contingent-share vesting penalty.</s>  (Thanks to a bit of clarification in the comments, turns out there&#8217;s no difference in our readings.)</p>

<p>I had the same reaction to his &#8220;we have to do something&#8221; comments on Sunday <a href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2008_09_21_archive.html#3312904511454422316">as Dr. Black</a>.  But we both, clearly, forgot the game that was being played.</p>
<p>Monday is a day of work, and <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/socialism-in-on.html">Dodd has clearly prepared well</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.<br />Sec. 2. Authority to purchase troubled assets.<br />Sec. 3. Considerations.<br />Sec. 4. Oversight.<br />Sec. 5. Rights; management; sale of troubled assets.<br />Sec. 6. Maximum amount of authorized purchases.<br />Sec. 7. Funding.<br />Sec. 8. Limits on review.<br />Sec. 9. Assistance to homeowners and localities.<br />Sec. 10. Maintaining insurance parity.<br />Sec. 11. Minimizing foreclosures.<br />Sec. 12. Termination of authority.<br />Sec. 13. Increase in statutory limit on the public debt.<br />Sec. 14. Credit reform.<br />Sec. 15. Annual financial reports and audits.<br />Sec. 16. Conflicts of interest.<br />Sec. 17. Executive compensation.<br />Sec. 18. Studies and reports.<br />Sec. 19. Disclosures on exercise of loan authority.<br />Sec. 20. Special inspector general for the troubled asset program.<br />Sec. 21. Definitions.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dodd, having played along with the &#8220;this is urgent&#8221; call has now presented the &#8220;if this is so urgent, show us what it&#8217;s really worth to you&#8221; card.</p>
<p>All the players may not yet be ready to go all-in, but the stakes are getting higher, and the <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/opening-for-maverick-by-digby-ed.html">planned abstention from the McCain campaign</a> may soon look as if it is lack of leadership.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ll end on a sad note. As Brad DeLong said <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/paul-krugman-vi.html">in an earlier post</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Dodd looks like a plan I can get behind&#8211;a serious attempt to solve the problem, preserve accountability, and balance the equities. Too bad he isn&#8217;t the VP nominee.</p></blockquote>
<p>But someone who opposed the bastardisation of FISA would have energized the base, and we can&#8217;t have that in Democratic politics.</p>

                                <p>CNN does some he-said, she-said, but <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/09/21/news/economy/bailout_proposal_Sunday/index.htm">throws in some data</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The administration&#8217;s proposal also requests that Congress authorize an increase to the nation&#8217;s debt ceiling. Currently, it&#8217;s set to rise to $10.6 trillion for fiscal year 2009 &#8211; which runs from October 2008 through September 2009. But the proposal requests that limit be increased to $11.315 trillion to allow for the purchases of mortgage-backed assets. [emphasis mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, strangely, I have always heard that assets have a positive value.  When I buy $100 worth of a stock—say, PWND—my Net Asset Value doesn&#8217;t change.  The same should be true of buying a MBS worth $0.30 on the dollar.</p>
<p>So why would we need to increase the deficit ceiling by $700,000,000,000 if we&#8217;re buying assets worth $700,000,000,000?</p>
<p>The only reasonable conclusion is that we plan to pay $700,000,000,000 <strong><em>above market</em></strong> for the securities.  No wonder it has to be &#8220;clean and quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heh indeedy.</p>
<p>FWIW, I hate it too.  My bias, also FWIW, is to prefer sucking up one&#8217;s principles as to how an economy should be run and extending a safety net rather than allowing key elements of it to fail and going along for the resulting ride.  Pace Ken from earlier, whatever risk there may be from going along with some sort of bailout, there&#8217;s also a risk from sticking to &#8220;principles&#8221; such as they may be.</p>
<p>Based on the <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/09/bailout-proposal.html">leaked draft of the proposal from the administration</a>, what we have is not only (or not just) a massive fund to bail out &#8216;too big&#8217; (or &#8216;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/EconomistsView/~3/396634238/connectedness.html">too interconnected</a>&#8216;) to fail institutions for which quick action may be needed, but rather authorization for authorization for mortgage market interventions anywhere the Secretary of the Treasury sees fit.  However necessary some additional interventions may turn out to be in the end, not every mortgage-related loss in the financial system requires urgent action by Congress with such blank-check terms.</p>
<p>Here are a few notable features.  First, the  broad grant of authority:<br />
<blockquote>(a) Authority to Purchase.&#8211;The Secretary is authorized to purchase, and to make and fund commitments to purchase, on such terms and conditions as determined by the Secretary, mortgage-related assets from any financial institution having its headquarters in the United States.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is the essence of the blank check — the purchases would be &#8220;on such terms and conditions as determined by the Secretary&#8221; and SecTreas is empowered to purchase &#8220;mortgage-related assets&#8221; from &#8220;any&#8221; domestically-domiciled financial institution.&#8221;  &#8220;On such terms&#8221; certainly can cut different ways: it could involve haircuts worthy of Sweeney Todd — but only if that&#8217;s how SecTreas exercises the available discretion.  Authorizing purchases from &#8220;any&#8221; domestically-domiciled financial institution means that the provisions are not limited to institutions posing systemic risks to the integrity of the financial system. (Apparently &#8220;domestic-domiciled&#8221; is now optional, according to the NYT article linked by Ken.)  Interestingly, &#8220;financial institution&#8221; is undefined, so while the NYT reports that Paulson doesn&#8217;t plan to use his authority to purchase hedge fund assets, it doesn&#8217;t seem that there&#8217;s anything in this language to prevent him from changing his mind.  Last, the definition of &#8220;mortgage-related assets,&#8221; apart from being broad enough to apparently extend the Secretary&#8217;s authority to the foulest toxic waste, does at least ensure that they&#8217;ve covered any needed bailing-out related to busts in commercial mortgages.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;d like to see here at a minimum would be more specific language requiring Treasury and some other entities (i.e. including but not necessarily limited to the Fed) jointly certify that an action under this title would be in service of avoidance of financial-system failure.  I&#8217;d also like to see a requirement that the terms of any purchase share any upside of the bailout for bailed-out firms with the public.</p>
<p>The features that look like they protect the public interest are weaker than they look:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 3. Considerations.</p>
<p>In exercising the authorities granted in this Act, the Secretary shall take into consideration means for&#8211;</p>
<p>(1) providing stability or preventing disruption to the financial markets or banking system; and</p>
<p>(2) protecting the taxpayer.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am not a lawyer, but as an occupational hazard have had occasion to learn a little about what this construction means. Directing agents to &#8220;take into consideration&#8221; things is not the same as &#8220;requiring&#8221; that they do specific things, not least when the factors to be considered are so vague.  If an action taken under this act includes a statement explaining how those factors were considered, then good luck getting a court to find that discretion was abused.  And if you were inclined otherwise, the belt-and-suspenders provision makes it clear that the intent of the draft legislation is to leave Treasury&#8217;s discretion unfettered:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 8. Review.</p>
<p>Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion, and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency.<br /><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/398600429/no-deal.html"></a></p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/398600429/no-deal.html">Brad DeLong</a> looks at that from the left-of-center position and says hell-no to giving this sort of discretion over $700 billion to Phil Gramm or anyone else who might be on John McCain&#8217;s shortlist for Treasury secretary; I&#8217;d have to wonder to what extent Republicans would want to hand the checkbook to one of the <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/06/obama-economic-advisors-and-economic.html">economists for Obama</a> with so few strings attached.  Reportedly Barney Frank is looking to give the Government Accountability Office audit and other oversight authority, and that would be one useful step towards proper oversight of the program.</p>
<p>Josh Marshall <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Talking-Points-Memo/~3/Z_6zdJjzzTc/218444.php">reports that banking lobbyists are already at work</a> trying to get congressional Republicans to oppose the introduction of ancillary provisions, with giving bankruptcy judges the right to modify loan terms chief among those opposed.  Yet the legislation does give Treasury the right to act as if it owns such mortgage rights as it may buy:<br />
<blockquote>Sec. 5. Rights; Management; Sale of Mortgage-Related Assets.</p>
<p>(a) Exercise of Rights.&#8211;The Secretary may, at any time, exercise any rights received in connection with mortgage-related assets purchased under this Act.</p></blockquote>
<p>The &#8220;considerations&#8221; of draft Section 3 don&#8217;t particularly reach the level of establishing policies for how any such rights should be exercised.  Obviously expanding this section to direct how Treasury exercises those rights is one of the ways the smarter Democrats are looking to improve the legislation.</p>
<p>Last, there&#8217;s what a cynic might consider the final enablement-of-kleptocracy provision, allowing the Secretary to:<br />
<blockquote>[enter] into contracts, including contracts for services authorized by section 3109 of title 5, United States Code, without regard to any other provision of law regarding public contracts;</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear to me why the entirety of contracting law need be bypassed for this purpose; this seems to be a &#8220;stick it in your eye, Good Government&#8221; provision.</p>
<p>If there&#8217;s one proposal for improvement that I&#8217;d be disinclined to pursue, it would be general executive-pay reform.  I like DeLong&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/398379129/note-to-self-hi.html">note to self</a>&#8221; on forcing pay above a threshold into restricted equity in principle, but this is not something for quick drafting, as otherwise the statute may just be an intellectual challenge for compensation consultants.  I&#8217;d keep it simple for the purpose of this legislation (assuming it&#8217;s inevitable) and just claw back any incentive pay for some specific set of officers of any firm that sells assets to Treasury under the bailout on terms that ensure the clawback comes out of the officers&#8217; personal wealth.  I&#8217;d like to see them slip in a return to the 39.6% top income tax rate, but I don&#8217;t know that the Democratic leadership has the guts to do so and let the Bushies signal how important they really think the bailout legislation is.</p>

(Or, as I would prefer to write it, just so everyone understands: $900,000,000,000.  About 3,000 a person, or 26.7% of the annual median household income, assuming a family of four.)</p>
<p>What would makes anyone think <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/just-like-beanie-babies.html">another $700,000,000,000</a> will solve the problem?  Just because &#8220;sooner or later, you&#8217;re talking about real money&#8221;?</p>
<p>It is, or should be, <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/understanding-t.html">no longer possible to pretend that this is still just a liquidity crisis</a>. Certainly, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/perception-v-reality.html">the Fed isn&#8217;t doing so</a>. It is well beyond that.</p>
<p>Adding liquidity will not solve the problem. And if the plan is to buy assets above their value—then why are we expected to <em>buy</em> Beanie Babies?  Shouldn&#8217;t we be selling them to Treasury Secretary <s>Gramm</s> <s>Fiorina</s> Paulson?</p>

                                <p>UPDATE:  <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/20/no-deal/">Krugman comes to the same conclusions, more concisely</a>.  (That&#8217;s why he gets paid the big bucks.)  And Brad DeLong has modified <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/understanding-t.html">his original position</a> to the point where <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/09/note-to-self-po.html">it&#8217;s got a good chance of working going forward</a>.</p>
<p>I started a &#8220;<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/what-is-asset.html">What is an Asset</a>&#8221; post yesterday, which got sidetracked by Brad DeLong&#8217;s urging that the rewards for bad behavior be maintained while expecting a return to the &#8220;good&#8221; intertemporal equilibrium to be maintainable in the face of payoff-dominant strategies that, in his scenario, become equally risky and offer higher rewards.*</p>
<p>For those who want to see where the post would have gone, let us pull two comments from  AnonCC to the fore:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;There are only a few problems, key of which is the title of this piece. Derivatives may have a value, but are they actually assets? Worse, if the Fed buys an asset, does it also have to buy all of the associated derivative contracts, one side of which may—by that simple—become worthless or become payable?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is precisely what really scares me about Paulson&#8217;s description of the bailout plan. Hybrid and synthetic CDOs (which cover most CDOs issued from 2006 on) are definitely not assets! These monsters are insurance companies that will be seen to be severely underfunded when insurers like MBIA, Ambac and AIG fail to pay on their reinsurance policies. If Treasury buys these insurance obligations, it will become a financial insurer for subprime.</p>
<p>(I should add that there are cash CDOs that are not insurance companies and can be fairly considered as assets. So all CDOs cannot be grouped in the same category.)</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re talking hundreds of billions paid up front for the privilege of providing this insurance, and trillions out the back door to hedge funds and the remaining investment banks over the next decade.</p></blockquote>
<p>Dean Baker <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=09&#038;year=2008&#038;base_name=questions_on_the_bush_bailout">takes  the question of the bailout to an even more elementary level</a>, having remembered that there is a market and therefore a &#8220;market value&#8221;:<br />
<blockquote>The most obvious question: is how will paying market price for near worthless assets prevent the collapse of zombie institutions like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and AIG? These institutions needed money. They won&#8217;t get it from selling mortgage backed securities, that are chock full of bad mortgages, at the market price. We already know this, because they already had the option to do so.</p>
<p>The Bush proposal to throw out hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to buy up this debt will do little if anything to prevent another round of collapsing banks. We will again see desperate weekends with Treasury and Fed honchos running around trying to save the next major basket case.</p>
<p>The other big question is: how will we get the banks to honestly describe the assets they throw into the auction?</p></blockquote>
<p>Unless the Fed is planning to buy assets at <em>above</em> market value—that is, to directly subsidize those same bankers and firms with taxpayer dollars, with concomitantly to make those risky assets &#8220;less&#8221; risky in the market and still providing no route or incentive to return to the &#8220;good&#8221; equilibrium—the &#8220;bailout&#8221; as discussed with have no positive effect on the health of the firm(s).</p>
<p>So what Henry Paulson is proposing has to be a direct subsidy to have any effect.</p>
<p>As an isolated plan, it is a reward for bad behavior.  Only if it were combined with those items for which we &#8220;don&#8217;t have time&#8221;—say, <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/09/recapitalizatio.html">the plan suggested by Mark Thoma</a>—could it possibly be an economically viable plan:<br />
<blockquote>First, in return for taking toxic assets off of a firms books at a price that is higher than the market rate, the government would get a share of any future profits the firm makes for some time period, say 10% for ten years, something like that. Administratively, it could come as an increased tax rate on profits and, if it helps politically, it could be earmarked for a particular cause. The government pays the firm a fair value for the assets plus an additional amount to help with recapitalization, and in return gets a claim on future profits for a period of time (I would also tie executive compensation directly to profits to help prevent gaming).</p></blockquote>
<p>*As a result of this, and some unfelicitous phrasing, I am now in DeLong Coventry.  I can live with that.</p>
