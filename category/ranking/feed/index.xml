				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just a little break from the usual. Did you know you can pay your taxes easier in Iraq than in the US?</p>
<p>I stumbled across this today. It is the <a href="http://www.doingbusiness.org/economyrankings/?IncomeId=0">World Bank page on Doing Business</a>. It ranks 178 countries on 10 topics. You can resort the order depending on 3 different settings. When you initially open the page you see the overall order.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the US with it&#8217;s over all ranking of 3, under ease of paying taxes: 76th. Iraq ranked 37 under this topic and is not even at the bottom over all! It even ranks 40th on registering property. But it is 164th on starting a business and once you start it, you probably can&#8217;t close it as that topic ranks 178 (the bottom).</p>
<p>Have fun.</p>
<p>Update: There is a report that goes along with this. <a href="http://rru.worldbank.org/Documents/DoingBusiness/DB-2005-Overview.pdf"> Doing Business in 2005</a></p>
