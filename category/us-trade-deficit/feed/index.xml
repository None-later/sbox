<p>U.S. Trade Deficit Largely Due to &#8220;Intra-Firm&#8221; Trade</p>
<p> The vast majority of the U.S. $727 billion trade deficit in goods for 2011 is due to &#8220;intra-firm&#8221; or &#8220;related party&#8221; trade, that is, trade between two units of the same corporation, according to the <a href="http://sasweb.ssd.census.gov/relatedparty/">U.S. Census Bureau</a>. This is significant because such trade is the most open to companies manipulating the prices between subsidiaries to minimize tax liabilities, usually known as abusive <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-transfer-pricing-hurts-middle-class.html">transfer pricing</a>. Moreover, as <a href="http://www.spokesmanbooks.com/acatalog/Stuart_Holland.html">Stuart Holland </a>argued in 1987, intra-firm trade is also less responsive to changes in exchange rates than is trade between independent businesses, since within an individual multinational corporation each subsidiary will have a specific role to play in its supply chain, which won&#8217;t be quickly changed.    </p>
<p>U.S. goods trade and related party trade (billions of dollars), world and selected countries, 2011:    <br />Country        Exports from US Imports to US Balance    <br />World            $1480.4     $2707.8          &#8211; $727.4    <br />World (RP)     $ 365.0      $1056.2          &#8211; $691.2    <br />Canada          $ 280.9      $ 315.3            -$  34.5    <br />Canada (RP)   $ 98.1        $ 162.0           &#8211; $ 64.1    <br />Ireland           $ 7.6          $ 39.4             &#8211; $ 31.7    <br />Ireland (RP)    $ 1.5          $ 34.6             &#8211; $ 33.1    <br />Mexico           $ 196.4      $ 262.9            &#8211; $ 64.5    <br />Mexico (RP)    $ 60.5        $ 155.7            &#8211; $ 95.2</p>
<p>Sources: Total trade, U.S. Census, <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0015.html">Trade in Good with World, Not Seasonally Adjusted</a>; Related party (RP) trade, U.S. Census, <a href="http://sasweb.ssd.census.gov/relatedparty/">NAICS Related-Party</a>, select all NAICS2, 2011, all countries, variables &#8220;imports related trade&#8221; and &#8220;exports related trade&#8221; and layout by country. <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c1220.html">Canada</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4190.html">Ireland</a>, and <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c2010.html">Mexico</a> as linked.    </p>
<p>As we can see, related party trade (which can mean trade within either a U.S. or foreign multinational corporation) is 27.6% of goods trade, but it represents a whopping 95.0% of the trade deficit. Moreover, in</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>countries where the U.S. has heavy foreign direct investment, such as Canada, Ireland, and Mexico, the trade deficit for intra-firm trade actually exceeds the country&#8217;s overall trade deficit.<br />In fact, virtually all U.S. imports from Ireland take the form of intra-firm trade. This is no doubt due to Ireland&#8217;s status as a tax haven and low corporate income tax rate of 12.5%.    </p>
<p>These data suggest that much of the U.S. trade deficit is due to U.S. corporations offshoring production and exporting the products back home. As the related-party data does not distinguish between U.S. and foreign multinationals, there is no way to know exactly how big the share of U.S. multinationals is in intra-firm, but is surely much more than half. Moreover, not counted in the data are imports that come from subcontractors (Wal-Mart&#8217;s many suppliers, Foxconn producing Apple products, etc.).    </p>
<p>The bottom line is that we need to reverse the incentives in the tax code that encourage the offshoring of jobs. (Why does <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/apple-whines-about-having-to-pay-taxes.html">Apple have $64 billion in cash abroad</a>?) However, to emphasize the point I made<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/08/it-middle-class-stupid-review.html"> last time</a> about what Americans want out of tax reform and the &#8220;reform&#8221; that has actually happened, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that Robert Gilpin of Princeton University, author of the seminal <i>U.S. Power and the Multinational Corporation</i> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/U-S-Power-Multinational-Corporation-international/dp/0465089518">1975</a>), made the same policy recommendation almost 40 years ago, and it hasn&#8217;t happened yet. We&#8217;ve got our work cut out for us.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Following the Mitt George Romney rule (&#8220;one year might be a fluke&#8221;), I went back and collected the data for all years back to 2002 (the earliest for which the related party trade info was available). While 2009-11 were all 95%, previous years were generally between 70% and 80%. I&#8217;m not sure yet what to make of that.</p>
