                                <p>UPDATE:  Brad DeLong lists some of the Usual Suspects <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2008/07/republican-econ.html">who are Not in the Line-up</a>.</p>
<p>John McCain&#8217;s <a href="http://johnmccain.com/Informing/News/PressReleases/Read.aspx?guid=c90681b9-5dfe-4de4-8057-ceedb30c228d">300 economists</a> who support <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/mccains-claim-of-balancing-budget-dont.html">his Jobs for America Plan</a> (via Tyler Cowen, non-sociopath, who <a href="http://www.marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2008/07/statement-of-30.html">provides an appropriate context for the list</a>) includes one person, an Ike Brannon, whose affiliation is listed as &#8220;Department of the Treasury&#8221; and who, per <a href="http://www.treas.gov/organization/officials.html">this site</a>, is &#8220;Senior Advisor to the [Tax Policy] Assistant Secretary,&#8221; one <a href="http://www.treas.gov/organization/bios/solomon-e.html">Eric Solomon</a>.</p>
<p>My initial suspicion was that this might be a violation of the Hatch Act.  But that appears <a href="http://www.osc.gov/ha_fed.htm#may">not to be necessarily true</a>:<br />
<blockquote>These federal and D.C. employees may-</p>
<p>    * express opinions about candidates and issues<br />    * contribute money to political organizations<br />    * attend political fundraising functions<br />    * attend and be active at political rallies and meetings<br />    * join and be an active member of a political party or club<br />    * sign nominating petitions<br />    * campaign for or against candidates in partisan elections<br />    * make campaign speeches for candidates in partisan elections<br />    * distribute campaign literature in partisan elections<br />    * hold office in political clubs or parties</p></blockquote>
<p>So as long as Mr. Brannon didn&#8217;t sign the petition while &#8220;on duty [or] in a government office [or] using a government vehicle,&#8221; it appears he is clearly permitted to sign the petition.</p>
<p>Now, generally, these petitions are circulated through personal connections. So presumably someone knows Mr. Brannon and forwarded it to him at his personal e-mail address. And one would assume that Mr. Brannon, if he were enthusiastic about the petition, would forward it—in a manner not to violate the Hatch Act—to others, including co-workers.</p>
<p>And presumably those others would know that, so long as the contact was of a personal nature, they, too, could sign on to &#8220;support of John McCain&#8217;s Jobs for America economic plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>The silence from the rest of the Treasury Department is deafening.</p>

<p>John McCain <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080619/ap_on_el_pr/mccain">gave a speech today</a> intended to brush up his credentials on energy issues, and called for 45 new nuclear reactors to be built by 2030 (and possibly 55 more thereafter) and $2 billion per year in spending on &#8220;clean coal&#8221; programs.</p>
<p>[sound of crickets chirping]</p>
<p>There are 104 operational civilian nuclear power reactors in the U.S. now.  In 2030, the median age of those reactors will be 52 — the youngest will be 34.  Figuring the working life of a reactor at 40-50 years, the bold McCain nuclear program might just about replace the nuclear generating capacity that will reach the end of its useful life.  That assumes, of course, that the new capacity could be installed at costs more like $2,000/kW (recent experience outside the U.S) than a pessimistic $5-6,000/kW; at the latter figure, wind would already be cheaper and could replace nuclear-generated electrons for the existing <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity">pumped-storage hydropower</a>.</p>
<p>The main virtue of the clean coal initiative, meanwhile, seems to be that it would create fewer CO2 emissions from the combustion of cash than McCain&#8217;s Iraq war policies.</p>
<p>McCain Economic Clown Show Update: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/19/us/politics/19nuke.html">Elisabeth Bumiller&#8217;s version of the story</a> (which manages to omit mention of the coal part of the story) opens:<br />
<blockquote>Senator John McCain said Wednesday that he wanted 45 new nuclear reactors built in the United States by 2030, a course he called “as difficult as it is necessary.”</p></blockquote>
<p>She also finds Douglas Holtz-Eakin making sure we all know the value of &#8220;difficult&#8221; is &#8220;not too difficult&#8221; and seemingly having difficulty with gross versus net additions to the nuclear fleet:<br />
<blockquote>Douglas Holtz-Eakin, Mr. McCain’s chief domestic policy adviser, said Mr. McCain had arrived at the goal of 45 as consistent with his desire to expand nuclear power, “but not so large as to be infeasible given permitting and construction times.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Practical, maybe, but if it&#8217;s &#8220;necessary&#8221; then Mavericky Boldness — really, the one thing McCain has to sell to non-Republicans at least in the eyes of the Village — might dictate policies that recognize that 22 years is a long time to remove existing constraints.  Those 52 oldest reactors in the current fleet, after all, came on line in less than 10 years from the late &#8217;60s to the late &#8217;70s.  I&#8217;m sure Axelrod and Plouffe will be happy to know that the underlying message is &#8220;America: almost as good as in the 1970s.&#8221;</p>
<p>Also, in the comments Lord and K Harris make excellent points regarding the true underlying socialism practiced by theoretically pro-market Republicans like McCain and George W. Bush.  Here&#8217;s David Cay Johnston with something to keep in mind, from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Free-Lunch-Wealthiest-Themselves-Government/dp/1591841917">Free Lunch</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The dominant group [in Washington] is thick with politicians like [California Rep. Bill] Thomas.  In public they speak of free enterprise and the virtues of competition. Behind closed doors, however, they work to create a paradise of corporate socialism for the few&#8230;</p>
<p>These are the Washington corporatists, whose hearts bleed for every company and industry complaining that the rules, and often the market, are unfair.</p></blockquote>

<p>The McCains, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/14/us/politics/14disclosure.html">poor little rich debtors</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Mr. McCain and his wife had at least $225,000 in credit card debt and&#8230; Mr. Obama and his wife had put more than $200,000 into college funds for their daughters.</p>
<p>The bulk of the McCains’ obligations stemmed from a pair of American Express credit cards that are held in Cindy McCain’s name. According to the disclosure reports, which present information on debts in a range rather than providing a precise figure, Mrs. McCain owed $100,000 to $250,000 on each card.</p>
<p>Another charge card, held by what was described as a “dependent child,” had also accumulated debts of $15,000 to $50,000. In addition, a credit card held jointly by the couple was carrying $10,000 to $15,000 in debt, the filing indicated, at a stiff 25.99 percent interest rate.</p></blockquote>
<p>Via <a href="http://feeds.boingboing.net/~r/boingboing/iBag/~3/311975516/john-mccain-creditca.html">BoingBoing</a>, where Cory Doctorow points to <a href="http://jtaplin.wordpress.com/2008/06/14/fiscally-responsible-john-mccain/">Jon Taplin</a> making the point that it might just pay the McCains to pay off those balances.  (See also <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/clever-math-clever-reasoning.html">Coberly</a> from last week.)</p>
<p>My own thoughts are pulled in two directions (angle of incidence indeterminate).</p>
<p>For one, a family member&#8217;s experience trying to divorce a full-service brokerage revealed that the business model there depends on having clients who are too rich to be bothered by having a few percent of their wealth siphoned off annually.  (Since some commenters don&#8217;t get the connection, remember McCain&#8217;s economic platform contends it would be bad for the economy if we increased the marginal rate of taxation on income the rich can evidently afford to waste.  Not to mention that there have already been efforts to frame the race as between Straight-Talking Man of the People John McCain and U. Chicago Elitist Barack H. Obama.)  Discussion point: Should we prefer having private firms soak the rich for profit over having the government soak the rich for public purposes?</p>
<p>For another, the report that the McCain&#8217;s are paying a penalty interest rate gives me some faith in soulless corporations.  This goes to another family member&#8217;s experience billing Delaware&#8217;s Old Money for children&#8217;s clothes in the relatively distant past (meaning before credit-card lending surpassed chemical manufacturing as the state&#8217;s dominant industry).  Those families graciously accepted the bills; it was just considered unseemly to expect them actually to pay the bills on any particular schedule.  Presumably, we&#8217;d need to know more about the McCains&#8217; pattern of delinquency to know whether 25.99% APR nevertheless reflects VIP treatment.</p>
<p>Update 6/17/08: Reader Jefff points to <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/06/13/ready-to-laugh-at-mccain_n_107008.html">this Huffington Post article</a> that points out that the interest rates on the main AmEx debts are 0%.  The disclosure lists the maximum amount owed over the reporting period, so the logical conclusion is that Cindy McCain sometimes runs up Very Large Charges in the course of a month and pays them off.  The Chase card with the 25.99% interest rate is a small head-scratcher; a couple grand in needlessly incurred interest may be chump change to the McCains, but <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/About/Cindy.htm">JohnMcCain.com</a> tells me how much Cindy cares about the poor little people of the world, and any food bank anywhere would be glad to see the money.  Her main debts appear to be associated with the Hensley &#038; Co. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/us/politics/27plane.html">Citation Excel</a>.</p>
<p>While the details of the disclosure are complex (<a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/pfds/candlook.php?CID=N00006424">get it here</a>), it is clear enough that the McCains or their financial advisors basically haven&#8217;t heard of low-cost mutual funds.  (See thought #1, above.)  In particular, while the children are loaded, they&#8217;re also making an elective contribution to the overhead at JPMC.</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>In BusinessWeek, Jane Sasseen&#8217;s &#8220;<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/bw/20080606/bs_bw/0824b4088081624555">Taxing the &#8216;Not-So-Rich&#8217; Rich</a>&#8221; tries to make me feel, uh, well, here&#8217;s the lede:<br />
<blockquote>By any measure, Dr. Howard Hammer and his wife, Hope, have a comfortable life. Hammer, 40, has built a thriving practice as an ear, nose, and throat specialist, while Hope, 39, has switched to part-time work as a real estate lawyer after years at a big firm in order to spend more time with [the kids]. Home is a four-bedroom house in the Philadelphia suburbs, and between them, they bring in over $300,000 a year. &#8220;We can&#8217;t complain,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We&#8217;re certainly not struggling.&#8221;</p>
<p>But are they wealthy? That&#8217;s far more debatable&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>Granted, income is a flow and wealth is a stock.  There&#8217;s nothing much beyond self-control that would prevent a family with a 97th-percentile income a la the Hammers from spending drunken sailors under the table (if perhaps in ways the drunken sailors would find dull), seeing as the modern economy&#8217;s undeniable talent is providing an array of goods and services capable of relieving anyone of their money for arbitrary values of &#8220;their money.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, a regularity of the income-and-wealth data is that households with $300,000/year incomes also tend to be in high percentiles of the wealth distribution.  In the Fed&#8217;s <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/oss/oss2/2004/scf2004home.html">2004 Survey of Consumer Finances</a>, for example, households in the 75th-90th percentile range for the wealth distribution had a median income of $77,000 (in 2004 dollars) and a mean income of $87,800.  So there&#8217;s some skew to the income distribution for people in that wealth fractile, but you can conclude that there aren&#8217;t too many people making $300,000/year who aren&#8217;t also in the top 10% of the wealth distribution.  At least, they&#8217;re for the most part rapidly on the way there.</p>
<p>And, sure enough, most people would probably be glad to have the financial stresses of the $300,000/year set:<br />
<blockquote>Ever-rising prices for gas, health insurance, and other expenses are hitting hard, as are the $3,000-a-month mortgage and the $2,000 he still pays monthly to whittle down his $160,000 medical school debt. A six-year residency gave Hammer a delayed start saving for retirement, so he worries if he&#8217;s stashing enough in his 401(k). By the time the couple contributes to the children&#8217;s college fund, there&#8217;s little extra at the end of the month.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s the horror of only having a little bit to save after socking away money for two of the main savings motives.  If they actually had to get to the point of curtailing their other savings, I&#8217;m quite sure that they could sharpen their pencils before their credit cards got maxed out.</p>
<p>Now you might recall that the upper-middle and upper classes did relatively well in that <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/node/28784">long national nightmare of peace and prosperity</a> known as the Clinton (I) years.  However, Dr. Hammer would have us know that he&#8217;s not really a Republican but, he tells BW:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind paying my fair share, but people act like they&#8217;re just talking about Bill Gates,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We would definitely feel a hit if our taxes went up.&#8221; Although a year ago he would not have considered voting Republican in November, now he&#8217;s not so sure: &#8220;Do you vote your heart, or do you vote your wallet?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>This looks like rather narrow pocketbook-voting insofar as Republican policies haven&#8217;t exactly helped with stuff like education, transportation, and health insurance prices and costs.  In a longer view the kids might be less than thankful for the taxes deferred to the next generation.  Perhaps Dr. Hammer is persuadable.</p>
<p>The BW piece seems to predict a major line of attack against Obama in the fall, namely that he&#8217;s planning the biggest middle-class tax increase EVER.  After all, a little rebranding (&#8220;death tax&#8221;) plus relentless marketing made a popular cause of relieving the super-rich of a tax burden nearly nobody is fortunate enough to bear, and if you&#8217;re a one-trick pony&#8230;<br />
<blockquote>But many also live in high-cost areas with expenses to match &#8212; and feel burned by talk of &#8220;taxing the rich&#8221; that doesn&#8217;t recognize that $250,000 stretches a lot further in the South or the Midwest than in Manhattan or Silicon Valley. &#8220;There is a huge difference between what politicians define as rich and what many Americans would call middle class,&#8221; says Patrick Anderson, CEO of the Anderson Economic Group and co-editor of The State Economic Handbook.</p>
<p>The soaring deficit, along with the fact that the Bush tax cuts expire at the end of 2010, provide much of the impetus for the coming fight over high-end taxes. If Washington doesn&#8217;t act, tax rates on income, capital gains, dividends, and other areas will return to the higher rates in effect before the cuts were enacted in 2001 and 2003. Senator John McCain (R-Ariz.)&#8230; has said he would extend the cuts for everyone, while Obama says he&#8217;ll maintain them for all but the wealthiest. If Obama wins, some taxes could go up as soon as 2009.</p></blockquote>
<p>It falls to Austan Goolsbee to remind everyone that you can get &#8220;many&#8221; by multiplying small fractions and the population of the United States, and besides the far upper tail of the income distribution is the only group that&#8217;s systematically done well under Bushonomics:<br />
<blockquote>Austan Goolsbee, Obama&#8217;s top economic advisor, points out that only a relatively small number of high-end earners would be tapped, while the majority of Americans would see their taxes fall or remain the same. &#8220;Income growth in that group has been extremely rapid, while it&#8217;s been stagnant for everyone else,&#8221; says Goolsbee. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to argue they face the same struggle to get by.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>No kidding.  And the sob stories may even get a little much for Ms. Sasseen, who closes thusly:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;People think the President can just extend the cuts, but he can&#8217;t,&#8221; says Stanford Group&#8217;s [Anne] Mathias. All of which explains why Mathias has been warning her clients that the next couple of years &#8220;will be a very bad time to be rich.&#8221; Whatever, precisely, that means.</p></blockquote>

                            <div class="content">
                                <p>James Pethokoukis <a href="http://www.usnews.com/blogs/capital-commerce/2008/4/18/gramm-speaks-the-views-of-our-next-maybe-treasury-secretary.html">interviews Phil Gramm</a>, economic advisor to John McCain. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s Gramm</p>
<blockquote><p>The interesting thing about the economic debate that we are about to have in America is that nowhere in the world can the two Democrat candidates show an example of countries that have succeeded economically by raising taxes, increasing government spending, and instituting protectionist measures&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Pethokoukis highlighted this, so it seems he thinks Gramm was making a good point.  I don&#8217;t check in on Pethokoukis often, but that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">isn&#8217;t a surprise</a> that he would think it&#8217;s a big deal.  It also isn&#8217;t a surprise these two would miss an example so close to home. </p>
<p>There are all sorts of gems in this interview, but I don&#8217;t have much time right now so let me just reach for the fruit that has actually gone through the effort of taking a bite out of my behind&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s more Gramm:</p>
<blockquote><p>When [Bill] Clinton took office, the economy was in a boom as the benefits of the Reagan economic program were being fully felt. Today, the economy is weaker, and also our competitors are stronger. One of the points you&#8217;ve got to understand is that what was good enough 25 years ago for America to be No. 1 is not good enough now. We want more growth, not less; more jobs, not fewer jobs&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>(Highlights by James Pethokoukis.)</p>
<p>How come when GHW Bush was in office, the economy wasn&#8217;t fully feeling (felting?  feeling up?) the benefits of the Reagan economic program?  Why weren&#8217;t those bennies there when GHW was in office?   As to faster growth, once again I suggest a look <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Gramm continues&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Senator McCain agrees that we should have more spending on housing, nutrition, education, clothing—the things that American families want. He agrees with the Democrats on that. Where they differ is the question of who should do the spending. The Democrats want government to do the spending. Senator McCain wants families to do the spending.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s very nice.  Give a janitor a tax cut that amounts to an added $20 in his pocket every month (all the while seeing his real income dropping due to these brilliant policies &#8211; I hate to sound like a broken record but Pethokoukis and Gramm really need to  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/01/dynamic-scoring-two-simple-graphs-tell.html">look at this</a>) and just watch him increase his spending on housing, nutrition, education, and clothing.  </p>
<p>More Gramm&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>And let me go back a second. The Democrats like to make a big deal out of how people said that Clinton&#8217;s increasing the tax rates was going to produce economic problems, but actually it was the overall economic program of Clinton that they said those things about, including having government take over one eighth of the economy in healthcare and a stimulus package where the government was going to fund pork barrel projects all over the country, from alpine slides in Puerto Rico to ice skating warming huts in Connecticut. But the Democrats conveniently forget that because the Republicans were able to defeat the healthcare program and the stimulus package, the Clinton program as he called for it was not implemented.</p></blockquote>
<p>So&#8230; basically Gramm is now saying that it was the stuff other than tax hikes that would have hurt the economy.  Presumably this means Gramm no longer thinks raising tax rates hurts the economy.  </p>
<p>Yet more Gramm&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>There are a lot of things you can say about the Bush tax cuts, but you can&#8217;t say they didn&#8217;t work. Those tax cuts clearly were a factor in bringing us out of the 2000 recession at near-record speed.</p></blockquote>
<p>What is it with these folks on the right and their fascination with the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/04/john-lott-looks-at-recessions-and.html">Great Recession of 2000 that Never Was</a>?  Have none of them heard of the NBER?   Or even teh google?  Its one thing to be incapable of performing any sort of analysis, but getting basic facts wrong is another thing altogether.  Its a sign one is either completely ignorant or trying to bs one&#8217;s audience.  </p>
<p>Gramm, toward the end of the interview&#8230;</p>
<blockquote><p>Remember, there are a lot of Americans who have not yet gotten a piece of the pie. Maybe you could limp along in France with the policy of the Democrats and just become more and more irrelevant to world trade and less of a competitor, but in America, where we have a growing population and people who want their shot at the American dream, those policies won&#8217;t work&#8230;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Americans who haven&#8217;t gotten a piece of the pie, eh?  But we all know what Gramm would say about policies that actually <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/06/comparing-presidents-poverty-rate.html">delivered a piece of the pie to many Americans</a> that hadn&#8217;t had one before &#8211; he opposed them, and still opposes them, stating as much earlier in the interview.  </p>
<p>Then there&#8217;s the dig at France, that bunch of limp-wristed beret-wearing frommage-eating pansy foreigners who like mimes.  Oh wait, aren&#8217;t they the good guys to folks like Gramm again because of Sarkozy?  Someone&#8217;s several months behind in reading his talking points. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have time to look up the figures, but I&#8217;d guess that &#8220;just become more and more irrelevant to world trade and less of a competitor&#8221; is a phrase that applies to the US from period from 1980 to 1992, and from 2000 to 2008, but perhaps not from 1992 to 2000.  </p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
