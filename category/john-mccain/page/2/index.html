                                <p>The Tax Foundation sent me an e-mail pointing me to <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/blog/show/23599.html">Gerald Prante</a> (who&#8217;s participated in our comments section in the past) taking <a href="http://www.time-blog.com/swampland/2008/09/mccains_health_care_tax_increa.html">Joe Klein</a> to task for calling McCain&#8217;s proposed $5,000* refundable tax credit that would offset income tax on health insurance benefits &#8220;insufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the McCain web site has to say:<br />
<blockquote>While still having the option of employer-based coverage, every family will receive a direct refundable tax credit &#8211; effectively cash &#8211; of $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families to offset the cost of insurance. Families will be able to choose the insurance provider that suits them best and the money would be sent directly to the insurance provider. Those obtaining innovative insurance that costs less than the credit can deposit the remainder in expanded Health Savings Accounts.</p></blockquote>
<p>The McCain campaign already deserves a few demerits for this representation of the plan.  First, they don&#8217;t mention the tax increase that the health insurance credit offsets.  Second, a credit that&#8217;s provided directly to insurers in lieu of (some) insurance premiums and then could be rolled over into an HSA if there&#8217;s something left over (which there won&#8217;t be for any family buying low-deductible health insurance) doesn&#8217;t sound much like it&#8217;s &#8220;effectively cash.&#8221;</p>
<p>Klein calls the McCain credit &#8220;insufficient&#8221; because it won&#8217;t pay the premium for typical employer-provided family coverage.  (<a href="http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/UploadedPDF/411750_updated_candidates_summary.pdf">Analysis</a> [PDF] of the plan by the Tax Policy Center indeed yields the result that the McCain plan would not provide for much insurance uptake among the currently-uninsured.)  Prante claims that Klein doesn&#8217;t know the difference between a credit and a deduction, and provides a calculation purporting to show that the value of the deduction that McCain would repeal is less than the credit:<br />
<blockquote>What [Klein] fails to understand is that the $5,000 value of the credit would be worth more than the current exclusion for almost any taxpayer. For example, a family in the 25% bracket would have its income tax before credits increase by .25 * 12,000 = $3,000. However, the family would be getting a $5,000 CREDIT that trumps the $3,000 extra in taxes from the elimination of the exclusion. Even&#8230; in the 35% bracket, the family having $12,000 in insurance would come out ahead.</p></blockquote>
<p>End of story?  Not quite.</p>
<p>In the quibble department, Prante assumes that the federal income tax exclusion can be repealed without state tax consequences.  To the extent state income definitions follow the feds, state taxes would take away several hundred more dollars of the credit.</p>
<p>The big question is whether today&#8217;s $12,000 employer-sponsored plan would still be available for no more than $12,000.  That depends on factors such as the employer exercising its &#8220;option&#8221; to continue to offer a group plan, and healthy members of the group resisting the incentives that the McCain plan provides to defect to the high-deductible insurance/HSA combination.</p>
<p>While McCain promotes the &#8220;option&#8221; of retaining existing coverage, the McCain plan&#8217;s incentives exacerbate &#8220;adverse selection death spiral&#8221; problems that particularly affect small groups under current policies.  That is, increasing the price of insurance coverage on the margin would encourage the healthy and/or lucky-feeling to exit relatively expensive group plans, with the tax credit intended to encourage substituting the combination of a high-deductible individual plan and accompanying HSA.  This leaves the comprehensive plans&#8217; members sicker, or at least lossier, and drives up prices for remaining participants.  (Repeat until the high price collapses the plan.)  The <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.27.6.w472/DC1">Buchmueller et al. review of the McCain plan</a> in Health Affairs mentions but does not quantify the potential effects of breaking up existing risk pools.</p>
<p>For employees sent to the individual market because employers drop group coverage, Buchmueller et al. suggest that insurance expenditures would increase markedly.  They indicate that the typical $12,000 group policy for a family would cost roughly $2,000 more to obtain in the individual market (and note that many plans in the individual market have lower prices but much lower coverage).</p>
<p>In Prante&#8217;s calculation, the $12,000 policy costs someone in the 25% bracket $9000 after income tax.  The $14,000 equivalent individual policy with the McCain family-level tax credit costs $9000 after income tax.  So we&#8217;ve already exhausted the purported net benefit of the McCain tax credit for a family that wants to keep its coverage but is knocked out of the employer-sponsored group market.  But the situation is actually worse than that, because shifting $9000 in compensation from benefits, which apparently the McCain plan would still exempt from payroll taxes, to wages subjects the compensation in lieu of benefits to payroll tax as well.  This can increase taxes up to $1377 (at 15.3%) in this example, depending on where the hypothetical family&#8217;s wages stand with respect to the Social Security contribution and benefit base (currently $102,000).</p>
<p>Having <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/08/right-wing-anti-tax-machine-doesnt-have.html">recently seen</a> the Tax Foundation concerned about Obama policies that would raise tax rates a few percentage points on high earners, it would be remiss of me to point out that the combined tax rates on wages paid in lieu of health benefits would be just as high for middle-class taxpayers under McCain&#8217;s health plan. That&#8217;s 25% for federal income tax, 5% or so for state taxes, and 15.3% for payroll taxes, 45.3% altogether, for compensation that current law and Obama policies would tax at 0%!  (A new Tax Foundation <a href="http://www.taxfoundation.org/publications/show/23610.html">issue brief</a> on the subject which otherwise mostly <a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/BradDelongsSemi-dailyJournal/~3/395454361/this-is-a-joke.html">invents a big number</a> for the McCain plan&#8217;s reduction in the uninsured does at least acknowledge this in passing.)  Since the McCain plan would, in the estimation of Buchmueller et al., shift millions of workers and their dependents to the individual market (representing 5 to about 15 percent of individuals covered under employer-sponsored plans; references in the article), the prospect of tax increases under the McCain plan is by no means vanishingly rare.  Indeed, shifting people to the individual market is basically a feature of the plan, and not a bug — a part of the program is to de-link employment and health insurance and that&#8217;s a legitimate policy goal.</p>
<p>This also leaves the question of just why conservative health reformers think we need to impose what amounts (vs. current policy) to a Pigovian tax on health insurance.  In the <a href="http://content.healthaffairs.org/cgi/content/full/hlthaff.27.6.w462/DC1">companion piece on the Obama plan</a> by Antos et al. also in Health Affairs, there&#8217;s talk of &#8220;perverse incentives&#8221; under the current system but not a lot of beef beyond econ 101-style handwaving:<br />
<blockquote>The following analysis reflects the authors&#8217; concern that Senator Obama&#8217;s failure to address the perverse incentives in the U.S. health system will exacerbate the cost problem he has argued must be solved if we are to achieve anything close to universal coverage. Tax subsidies that promote first-dollar coverage have led consumers, health care providers, and suppliers to act as if any service that might yield some value, no matter how small, should be covered. Subsidized third-party payment has helped drive up health spending and, as demonstrated by the <em>Dartmouth Atlas,</em> sometimes has even led to poorer health outcomes. Realistic expectations about cost, value, and the outcomes that health care is likely to provide must be better understood by all parties.</p></blockquote>
<p>An upshot of recent <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/alice-in-co-payland.html">health-care cost-shifting</a> between employers and employees is that &#8220;first-dollar&#8221; coverage is now rare.  I&#8217;ve had true first-dollar coverage in the distant past, ain&#8217;t got it now, and couldn&#8217;t have it for a premium that would keep my small employer-sponsored group together.  A main idea behind copayments and coinsurance is to avoid some obvious free-as-in-beer-goods problems by not covering the first dollar.</p>
<p>Moreover, they totally beg a central economic efficiency question: given the disconnection between health care prices and marginal costs, it&#8217;s far obvious that allocative efficiency is better served by exposing consumers to something like the list prices of routine services as opposed to the co-payments or co-insurance.  (Exercises: What&#8217;s the marginal cost of a $150-list-price office visit where you spend 5 minutes with a nurse and 5 minutes with the doctor?  Of a $1000 CT scan?  The $200 month&#8217;s supply of an on-patent drug?)  Explanation of benefits forms provide routine evidence that much or most of the price of various health-care services is markup.**</p>
<p>Of course, dynamic efficiency considerations mean that incremental cost constraints must be satisfied somehow — marginal cost prices wouldn&#8217;t be compensatory for the doctors, clinics, and hospitals.  But efficiency-improving pricing arrangments that better align prices with marginal costs such as &#8220;two-part tariffs&#8221; (where customers pay a fixed charge plus variable usage-based charges; see e.g. your electric, gas, or [limited-usage] phone bill) can look a lot more like traditional insurance with what Antos et al. characterize as &#8220;modest&#8221; cost sharing than a high-deductible health plan plus an HSA.  On this front, the conservative reform approach involves an unforgivable conflation of price and cost.***</p>
<p>Nor do some of the &#8220;perversions&#8221; sound all that perverse as features of private or social insurance.  On Obama&#8217;s proposal to establish a federal reinsurance pool, Antos et al. write:<br />
<blockquote>Even though employers would welcome the subsidy, the reinsurance does not reduce health care use or cost. Instead, the policy just shifts some of the cost to the federal budget and could even increase health care spending. Insurers and providers might be encouraged to provide more services to patients who were above the catastrophic threshold since the federal government was sharing in the cost.</p>
<p>The proposal could also lead to anomalous results. One neonatal intensive care stay could lead to federal catastrophic payments for an employer with younger employees (and lower health costs per employee), while an employer with older workers and much higher per employee costs might receive no subsidy for the costs of managing chronic conditions.</p></blockquote>
<p>This is just about 180-degrees backwards.  True, risk-spreading does not in itself reduce the cost of health care, but it does reduce the cost of health insurance, and reducing the cost of insurance helps promote efficient (multi-part) pricing of health care.  Moreover, million-dollar NICU trips and the like are exactly the sort of losses for which reinsurance is appropriate.  In the absence of adequate reinsurance, catastrophic losses are a death-spiral trigger, since especially small groups end up with huge premium increases leading to collapse of the plans one way or another.   As for covering chronic conditions such as aging, the factoid that most of us would like to grow old and healthy, and be well-cared-for in the alternative, suggests a role for intergenerational transfer mechanisms for equitable distribution of the costs.</p>
<p>It might be argued that the reinsurance services could be provided privately, but what I&#8217;ve heard from people involved with such matters at local health insurers is that health care reinsurance isn&#8217;t a candidate for Marginal Revolution&#8217;s &#8216;markets in everything&#8217; series.</p>
<p>Hoisted from our archives, here&#8217;s <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2004/09/kerrys-health-care-reinsurance.html">Kash from 2004</a> addressing the question of whether the reinsurance pool (also a Kerry proposal) would increase costs:<br />
<blockquote>How would this national reinsurance pool help our nation&#8217;s health care problem? In a couple of ways. First and most obviously, it would simply reduce the cost to health insurers of providing health insurance, resulting in lower premiums. Part of this cost would be shifted to taxpayers, but as we shall see, the cost to taxpayers will be less than the savings reaped by people buying health insurance&#8230;</p>
<p>Think of it this way. Since the claims for one seriously ill person can easily reach $100,000 or more in a year (while most people&#8217;s claims are probably just in the hundreds of dollars), it&#8217;s much harder for an insurance company to predict what the aggregate health care costs will be of a group of 10 people compared to a group of 1,000 people. The law of large numbers means that you can pretty much rely on population averages when trying to guess how much health care the large group will need over the year; but for the small group, you either have to spend a lot of time and energy evaluating each of the 10 individuals to estimate each one&#8217;s likely health care needs for the coming year, or else you have to just take a chance. And insurance companies hate just taking chances.</p>
<p>The best estimates that I have seen by an economist of the effects of this reinsurance proposal are those by Kenneth Thorpe, professor at Emory&#8217;s school of public health. <a href="http://www.sph.emory.edu/hpm/thorpe/nobugthorpe2.pdf">He estimates</a> that the Kerry plan would reduce the variance of firms&#8217; insurance claims by about 50 percent. This in turn will have two effects. It means that it will become dramatically cheaper for small firms to provide health insurance to their employees. Combined with the plan&#8217;s requirement that all participating firms offer health insurance to all employees, Thorpe estimates that about 3 million currently uninsured people will start receiving health insurance. This in turn will help to reduce the country&#8217;s overall health care costs by allowing more preventative care and early detection of health problems.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is, since insurance costs depend on the variance of the losses, insufficient reinsurance implies higher risk premia paid to insurers, and those premia are big.</p>
<p>So McCain policies would raise taxes on lots of middle-class workers and dramatically increase marginal tax rates on some middle-class earnings regardless of the net benefits (something conservatives wring their hands over in other contexts), not obviously in service of aligning health care prices and marginal costs and without features that promote efficient risk-sharing.  That&#8217;s changiness we shouldn&#8217;t believe in, my friends.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>* For a family; individuals would get $2500.  Observe that there&#8217;s a family insurance penalty in the plan, as family plan premiums are commonly more than double individual premiums.</p>
<p>** E.g., the negotiated price between my health plan and the UW hospital for my son&#8217;s emergency appendectomy last year was roughly 1/3 of list.</p>
<p>*** Yes, people use &#8220;cost&#8221; when they mean &#8220;price&#8221; colloquially all the time; the problem is not considering price/cost ratios carefully when arguing that one price promotes economic efficiency better than another.</p>

<blockquote>&#8220;He did this,&#8221; Douglas Holtz-Eakin told reporters this morning, holding up his BlackBerry.  &#8220;Telecommunications of the United States is a premier innovation in the past 15 years, comes right through the Commerce Committee.

<p>And the Blackberry is made by that fine American company <a href="http://www.rim.com/">Research in Motion</a>, based in <a href="http://www.rim.com/company/index.shtml">Waterloo, Ontario</a>.</p>

<blockquote>Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the former chief economist at the Council of Economic Advisers who has been serving as top economics guru for the McCain campaign, has moved over to serve as Palin’s chief domestic-policy adviser.</p></blockquote>
<p>A while back, a commenter who&#8217;d worked in his shop remarked on Holtz-Eakin&#8217;s great sense of humor.  Looks like he&#8217;ll need it for all those questions about the best policies to bring big-box retailers to the Alaskan bush.</p>
<p>P.S. Good question from Don Pedro at <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/09/who-is-taking-over-as-mccains-chief.html">E4O</a>:<br />
<blockquote>So which of those sitting on McCain&#8217;s economic policy adviser <a href="http://econ4obama.blogspot.com/2008/06/other-list-mccains-economists.html" target="_blank">backbench</a> are stepping up to man the helm? Does this mean that Phil &#8220;you&#8217;re all a bunch of whiners&#8221; Gramm is running the show? Maybe an enterprising journalist should ask.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>The essence of &#8220;market-based&#8221; health care &#8220;reforms&#8221; is that patients are exposed to the prices of the services that they receive (or are offered) and choose not to consume those with low perceived net benefits.  With high-deductible health plans favored by conservative reformers, this means paying out of pocket for routine services. [*] This is a centerpiece of <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/19ba2f1c-c03f-4ac2-8cd5-5cf2edb527cf.htm">health care reform a la McCain</a>, in the mild camouflage of &#8220;innovative insurance&#8221; and &#8220;expand[ed] benefits of health savings accounts.&#8221;  [**] These plans already have been growing rapidly with a push from Bush and congressional Republican policies.</p>
<p>So how are they working out?  <a href="http://www.startribune.com/business/27701694.html?elr=KArksUUUU">In the S&#8217;trib&#8217;</a>, Chen May Yee finds that market magic does not always include putting enough dollars in those pockets:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Once a month, doctors and staff at Edina [Minnesota] Sports Health &#038; Wellness stay late to talk business&#8230;. Then there&#8217;s the topic nobody likes: which patients to drop because they aren&#8217;t paying their bills.</p>
<p>The clinic has been terminating an average of 16 patients a month. Most have high-deductible health plans and haven&#8217;t paid their bills for more than nine months&#8230;</p>
<p>Break-up letters from doctors are just one unintended consequence in the roll-out of high-deductible plans, the fastest-growing segment of the medical insurance market as traditional plans become ever more unaffordable.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yee reports that the breakups happen in relatively special cases (e.g. small clinics that can&#8217;t afford to provide much uncompensated care) and information on the extent of the phenomenon is anecdotal.  However, larger organizations are seeing increases in uncompensated care provided to the theoretically-insured:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Last year, [Hennepin County Medical Center] gave away $86 million in uncompensated care &#8212; $4 million, or 4.7 percent, to insured patients. This year, HCMC expects $90 million in uncompensated care, with 8.4 percent, or $7.5 million, from insured patients&#8230;</p>
<p>Fairview Health Services, Regions Hospital and HealthEast Care System also are seeing more unpaid bills from insured patients. Like HCMC, they&#8217;re nonprofit, with policies not to turn patients away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I might suggest that a system is only so market-based when it relies on the public or (publicly-subsidized) nonprofit sectors to cover its failures.  And for an added bonus, the system is not necessarily cheaper to administer:
</p>
<blockquote><p>Medical billing offices are working harder than ever. What used to be paid by insurance in a couple of weeks is now being stretched out to two- to six-month payment plans for patients, said Randi Tapio, chief executive of Medical Billing Professionals in St. Cloud, a firm that works with independent physician offices.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re sending statements every month, calling them,&#8221; Tapio said. &#8220;Our costs go up.&#8221;</p>
<p>If a patient is uninsured, a clinic can ask for payment upfront or devise an early payment plan. But with insured patients, health plans require that clinics wait until after the service and the health plan determines who owes what. By then, the patient is out the door.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But never fear, improved bill-collection technology is here!</p>
</p>
<blockquote><p>Recently, [a] clinic began asking patients having costly procedures such as surgeries to swipe a credit card upfront. An estimated amount is authorized but not charged until the health plan sends a letter saying what the patient owes&#8230;</p>
<p>HealthEast clinics are looking into check-in kiosks, like those at airports, where patients insert a credit card and are asked if they want to pay their co-pay.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing is to be more intentional about collecting,&#8221; said Keith Rahn, who oversees HealthEast clinic billing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=U.S._Chamber_of_Commerce">U.S. Chamber of Commerce</a> has been running &#8216;issue ads&#8217; telling Minnesotans that Sen. Norm Coleman has been working to keep government out of health care decisions.  The credit-card companies, not so much.</p>
<p></p>
<p>[*] Which is to say, the premise of the system is that its biggest problem is overconsumption of routine care.  In this regard, it runs against the current of some traditional health plans which have been reducing out-of-pocket shares for some expenditures (e.g. related to chronic conditions like diabetes) because their members are perceived as not being good at picking and paying for the higher-return care.</p>
<p>[**] Amusingly, while Obama issues pages generally link to more detailed <a href="http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/issues/HealthCareFullPlan.pdf">briefing documents</a> [PDF], a &#8220;Learn More About the McCain Health Care Reform Plan&#8221; link takes visitors to <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/healthcare/">this page</a> with a few bullet points and an auto-playing video ad, which in turn links back to the issues page for &#8220;the facts.&#8221;</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>Another major energy proposal in the McCain economic plan is ending subsidies for corn ethanol and eliminating the tariff that effectively bars to importation of sugar cane ethanol. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/13/business/13view.html?ex=1373601600&#038;en=d29d44dcc70127bf&#038;ei=5124&#038;partner=permalink&#038;exprod=permalink"> Greg Mankiw scored these on behalf of the economics profession</a> as points for McCain over Obama in the NYT over the weekend.  I agree that corn ethanol subsidies are best eliminated as soon as possible — though I note that Obama, while not going so far as McCain on subsidies, is pretty straight-talking about the limitations of corn ethanol especially considering that he represents the corn belt and not the desert.</p>
<p>On the McCain plans for promoting trade in cane ethanol — the Shorter Version of which is that he&#8217;s proposing to substitute dependence on foreign ethanol for dependence on foreign oil (*) — there are significant issues that go to the suitability of &#8220;free&#8221; markets for provision of biofuels.  Whether or not expanding trade in ethanol is a good thing depends on other institutional arrangements that are not automatic consequences of reducing tariffs and other moves to freer trade.  Since critical policy decisions are outside the reach of U.S. policymakers, economists should be concerned about making policy with the institutions we have, and not the institutions we&#8217;d like to assume we have.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s been a broad dawning that not all biofuels, and not all methods for producing all biofuels, equally satisfy all of the policy goals that they might purport to help satisfy.  Those include substituting domestic resources for imported resources, reducing fossil fuel use, and reducing the carbon intensity of liquid fuel use.  Land use issues are critical both for the global warming-related goals for biofuel use and for avoiding blowback from high food prices.  (Recent <a href="http://www.news.wisc.edu/15382">research out of UW-Madison</a> shows that redirecting marginal agricultural lands to cane ethanol in fact can be beneficial, but conversions from forests and other uses are not.)  The problem is that lowering tariffs on cane ethanol doesn&#8217;t guarantee, and indeed in the absence of other interventions would probably work strongly against, desirable land use patterns.</p>
<p>Brazil <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_fuel_in_Brazil#Economic_and_production_indicators">produces a lot of ethanol</a> by the standards of the ethanol industry, but not a lot relative to U.S. petroleum-based fuel imports.  The former was 327,000 barrels/day in &#8217;07, whereas the latter is 13-14 million b/d (unadjusted for the energy densities of the fuels).   Growing enough cane to replace U.S. oil imports with ethanol would require on the order of half the arable land area of Brazil; major cane ethanol substitution would necessarily occur at scales where adverse land-use consequences can&#8217;t be assumed away.  Note that the current food-price spike, largely blamed on biofuel mandates, happened with only a couple percent of arable land devoted to biofuel crops.</p>
<p>Economists certainly can imagine market-based remedies for the problem, such as Pigovian taxes on certain land-use changes, to name one that Mankiw ought to support in principle.  But removing U.S. tariffs won&#8217;t make land-use regulation in countries suitable to cane growing appear by magic.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to add in liquid-fuel demand destruction on hitherto unprecedented scales for the U.S.  Along those lines, apart from his willingness to commit 15% of one year&#8217;s &#8220;clean coal&#8221; research funds to the cause of battery technology, McCain isn&#8217;t explicitly committed to more than the pending tightening of fuel economy regulations.  McCain&#8217;s long-standing hostility to rail and apparent indifference towards non-automobile transportation modes doesn&#8217;t make the job of reducing petroleum-based fuel consumption (and doing it in less painful ways to consumers than letting the price mechanism work its magic) any easier.</p>
<p>(*) Economists wouldn&#8217;t tend to be bothered by this, but it&#8217;s at odds with McCain&#8217;s energy independence rhetoric.</p>

                                <p>Here&#8217;s an oddity from the McCain economic plan — McCain found some jobs that have gone away and that does want to bring back:<br />
<blockquote>The development of clean coal technology will revitalize coal mining and return jobs to some of America&#8217;s most economically disadvantaged areas.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/ptb0702.html">U.S. coal production</a> was 1.146 billion (short) tons in 2007, just short of the record 1.163 billion tons in 2006.  There are three major features of coal production history: a long secular increase from the early sixties, a shift from underground to surface (a/k/a strip) mining as the dominant production mode, and great increases in productivity in both modes from the 1980s onward.  In 1987, an <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/txt/ptb0706.html">hour of mining labor</a> extracted 2.2 tons of coal in an underground mine, and 4.98 tons in a surface mine.  By 2007, those figures had increased to 3.26 and 10.23 tons/hour, respectively.</p>
<p>So why is John McCain against labor productivity?</p>
<p>And why am I reminded of Dana Carvey&#8217;s <a href="http://www.danacarvey.net/media/snl_grumpy_losealimb.wav">Grumpy Old Man</a> character?  &#8220;In my day, we mined coal with our fingernails, got black lung, and that&#8217;s the way it was, and we LIKED IT!!&#8221;</p>

                                <p>By: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>I am responding to a post put up at Crooks and Liars: <a href="http://www.crooksandliars.com/2008/07/11/the-mccain-campaigns-small-business-myth/">The McCain campaign small business myth.</a></p>
<p>It presents that the myth is found in the number of small businesses in existance and what percentage of them earns $250,000 or more.  I love C and L, but this is just totally missing the ship (notice I did not say boat).</p>
<p>The lie to the McCain position on Obama&#8217;s tax plan is not in the number of small business in existence or in the number of small business making over $250,000/yr.</p>
<p>The lie to the McCain position is in the conflating of business income with personal income.  An S corp or a solo proprietorship business or any other similar configuration that is paying income tax on $250,000 is paying income tax on that money not because the business made that income and is keeping it because the business had plans for it. No, no, nooooooooo.   It is the owner of the income generator that made that income and they made it as personal income.  It is the amount of money remaining AFTER the business did it&#8217;s complete business thing for the year.  It is the money remaining AFTER the business spent on expanding jobs, or buying more equipment, or marketing, or adding new facilities, or expanding to China, or hedging its energy costs or PAYING IT&#8217;s BUSINESS RELATED TAXES.  It is the money that the owner of the income generator walked out the door with at the end of the year and then proceeded to use on their personal needs like: food, housing, transportation, oil futures, corn futures, GE, Haliburton stocks, boats, collectable cars, art, entertainment, lawn care, maid services, tuitions, security systems, etc.  </p>
<p>In fact, anyone who has started a business has experienced that moment when their accountant calls them up and says: “You owe income taxes.”  The rest of the conversation goes something like this: But, but, but, but, but&#8230;how can I owe taxes when I have no money left?  “Well” responds your accountant, “did you buy food?”.  Why yes I did, but I have nothing left.  “Then the money you bought food with is the income your business paid you and now you owe Uncle Sam”.  At that moment your stomach is getting ready to pay Uncle Sam as your legs are giving out.  Later on, when you are humming along and you are taking $250,000 out of your S corp because you had no more expenses the true nature of you spirituality shows through.  Either you think your taxes are too high, or you understand the benefits of paying taxes but think that spending more than the rest of the world combined on military is crazy.</p>
<p>Why the pundit&#8217;s on the Obama side have not pointed this conflation out, I do not know.  Do they not believe in education?  But, focusing on the number of businesses when the issue is personal income only allows the presentation on taxation and income to continue in the same vein as it has been continuing since Reagan.  It is a continuation of the same argument that has allowed us to accept that Walmart cheap is the same as more money in your pay check; or that the increased cost of your benefits are the same as more money in your paycheck; or that the rising share of income going to pay all your taxes owed is the results of some waste and greed and civil service unions and teacher unions and not the results of less income earned from your labor; or taking a pension fund away is OK because it was not money earned but money gifted.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m an S corp, I was a sole proprietorship and the other business is an S corp.   </p>
<p>If we don&#8217;t stop watching the shells we will never win the game of find the pea.</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>I was working on a much more detailed post when The Onion, Priceless National Treasure it is, gave a portion of the subject the <a href="http://www.theonion.com/content/opinion/were_investing_so_much_in">treatment</a> it arguably deserves.</p>
<p>Somewhat more seriously, though, the McCain <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Images/Issues/JobsforAmerica/briefing.pdf">briefing document</a> is heavy with what would be long-term solutions to an array of more-or-less urgent short-term problems.
<ul>
<li>Oil drilling: The near-term features of the McCain program for the oil market amount to Really Tough Talk (&#8220;John McCain believes we should send a strong message to world markets&#8221;).  There&#8217;s nothing in the plan to address near-term supply tightness &#8212; and they&#8217;re so slick with that Intarwebby thing that the <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/4dbd2cc7-890e-47f1-882f-b8fc4cfecc78.htm">campaign web site</a> still proposes to <a href="http://www.mcclatchydc.com/242/story/37393.html">stop filling the SPR</a>.  The big issue, though, is the expectation that guys like <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/t-boone-pickens-places-his-bet-on-wind.html">T. Boone Pickens</a> are right and the current amount of global supply (85-90 million barrels/day) is about all we can expect to see, versus well over 100 million b/d in recent official forecasts.  Undoing that effect requires adding Saudi Arabia-like quantities to the market more-or-less permanently, not the couple million barrels/day that off-limits U.S. sources will produce at their peak in a couple of decades.  I wouldn&#8217;t expect a big price response.  Should McCain manage to win and enact his plan (or Republican pro-drillers manage to peel off Democrats who think we need to Do Something!1!!), don&#8217;t go putting down a deposit on that Escalade.</li>
<li>Transportation: Apart from the <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2008/06/you-make-the-ca.html">silly battery prize</a>, the big proposal is a tax credit for zero-emissions cars.  There are worse ideas, but a big shift to electric cars would require R&#038;D and other investments in the electricity grid, distributed power technologies, and the like which could use considerable funding (see money to be thrown at coal, below).  As for other transportation modes, there are no other transportation modes as far as the published McCain program is concerned.  So in McCain world, the path out of transportation-caused oil dependency is from power plants to your future car&#8217;s battery pack.</li>
<li>Electricity: The McCain plans, as we&#8217;ve previously seen, promote nuclear and &#8220;clean coal.&#8221;  The 45 new reactors would probably be needed just to maintain nuclear&#8217;s share of the generation portfolio, given the age of the fleet.  As it happens, the nuclear industry is more aggressive than McCain, with applications for 15 reactors somewhere in the <a href="http://www.nrc.gov/reactors/new-licensing/new-licensing-files/expected-new-rx-applications.pdf">NRC permitting pipeline</a>, and 19 more applications expected between now and 2010.  Getting nuclear economics to work would be greatly facilitated by the <a href="http://www.johnmccain.com/Informing/Issues/da151a1c-733a-4dc1-9cd3-f9ca5caba1de.htm">McCain cap-and-trade plan</a>, whose absence in the briefing document is a huge omission, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/07/how-serious-is-mccain-about-cap.html">whatever we&#8217;re to make of it</a>.  The &#8220;clean coal&#8221; program is in <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/30/business/30coal.html?pagewanted=all">disarray</a> and would need substantial funding to get back on track, but with theoretically more efficient approaches to carbon capture just taking their <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/cen/news/86/i09/8609notw1.html">initial steps out of the laboratory</a>, it&#8217;s not obvious that McCain can do much to get the technology to market very far ahead of the 2020s time frame assumed by the Electric Power Research Institute, not exactly a tree-hugger&#8217;s hangout by throwing his $2 billion/year at the problem.  Meanwhile, there are no specific plans to fund any other needed electricity-system R&#038;D.  Making the renewables tax credit permanent is a genuinely useful feature of the McCain program, if not exactly a radical proposal, and otherwise staying out of the way of renewables development is not bad for a Republican.</li>
<li>Energy Efficiency: McCain is pro-CAFE and pro-energy-efficient building, but doesn&#8217;t stake a position on whether current and forthcoming standards are adequate or how they might be improved.  Should oil prices drop substantially, we&#8217;d need some substance here to support McCain&#8217;s anti-oil-dependency rhetoric, as the &#8217;90s experience shows.</li>
</ul>
<p>So what do we have?  Long-term commitments to do Things Republicans Like (drill for oil, burn coal) surrounded with a lot of hand-waving and redirection as to how those will solve current problems.</p>

<blockquote>while I&#8217;d ordinarily assume that economists signing on to &#8220;John McCain&#8217;s plan&#8221; were signing on to the actual document he had released, the fact that those 300 names were released within hours made me wonder whether all of them had had a chance to read the document itself.</p></blockquote>
<p>The answer, of course, was &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>

<p>Time to pile on regarding the 300 economists for the McCain economic plan.  I thought it was pretty funny that Douglas Holtz-Eakin signed on &#8212; &#8216;look, boss, I approve of my own plan!&#8217; &#8212; and the presences of the likes of Phil Gramm, Kevin Hassett, and John R. Lott Jr. should be viewed as each constituting minus a large number of good economists, so the net number of signatories is close to zero.</p>
<p>The opportunity for confusion, as even <a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/market-movers/2008/07/08/the-economic-policy-of-john-mccain?rss=true">Felix Salmon exhibits some</a>, is the presence of undeniably prominent economists on the list.  To help in evaluating the significance of there presence, here&#8217;s a prediction from quasi-Nobel laureate Gary Becker (signer of the McCain statement), current CEA chair Edward Lazear, and John Bates Clark medalist Kevin Murphy of the Chicago GSB (Lazear and Murphy did not sign):<br />
<blockquote>The evidence is clear: Cutting taxes will have beneficial effects. Tax cuts will keep government spending in check and will provide the incentives necessary to produce a highly skilled, productive work force that enables high economic growth and rising standards of living.</p></blockquote>
<p>That was from &#8220;<a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB106548881712135300-search.html?collection=wsjie%252F30day&#038;vql_string=becker%253Cin%253E%2528article%252Dbody%2529">The Double Benefits of Tax Cuts</a>,&#8221; published on the W$J op-ed page on October 7, 2003.  Goes to show that the line between being a real economist and a &#8220;policy entrepreneur&#8221; is a fine one. For some indications of how that has worked out, see e.g. <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/08/comparing-presidents-rankings-of.html">here</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-fiscal.html">here</a>, <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/09/ranking-presidents-personal-income.html">here</a>, and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/10/comparing-presidents-average-real.html">here</a> from the AB archives.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, leave it to the <a href="http://rudepundit.blogspot.com/2008/07/in-brief-john-mccain-hateshearts.html">Rude Pundit</a> to get right to the fundamental contradiction of the list (a very extended, and actually non-rude, excerpt is required):<br />
<blockquote>So John McCain proposes a gas tax holiday and economists almost universally say it&#8217;s a stupid idea. In June, McCain, being a reasonable man, chooses to mock the economists: &#8220;If you want to call it a gimmick, fine. You know the economists? They’re the same ones that didn’t predict this housing crisis we’re now in.&#8221;&#8230;</p>
<p>Now McCain has put forth a great and mighty economic plan. Did it yesterday, less than a month after dissing the poindexters. And his campaign has released a letter from, well, who else? Economists who support it. Oodles of them. Guess they know a lot about economics, eh?</p>
<p>&#8230;[T]he Rude Pundit chose one of the names at relatively random. University of Chicago&#8217;s Gary Becker, who does a blog on, you know, economics&#8230; [B]ack in December 2007, Becker says, &#8220;The vast majority of economists, including me, were surprised by the extent of the subprime mortgage crisis.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, to conclude: for John McCain, economists who didn&#8217;t predict the mortgage crisis don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re talking about when it comes to a gas tax holiday, but when it comes to his entire economic plan, they&#8217;re a-ok. What fun.</p>
<p>Does that qualify as straight talk?</p></blockquote>
