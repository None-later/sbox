                                <p>I promise, there are numbers here, but lets have some fun first and write a screen play to set up the point.  It is long, but&#8230; 
<div></div>
<div>&#8220;Dear, I&#8217;m getting nervous.  We seem to keep adding to how much money we owe and our income hasn&#8217;t changed for the better.  What can we do?&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>At this point of the conversation, the conservative ideology (Republican and Democratic Parties) suggests and encourages you to believe that the answer is something like: &#8220;Well Honey, as I look over the horizon I see no possibility for improving our current position.  The only thing we can do is cut back on our spending.  We have to stop spending on anything we don&#8217;t need to live.  If we are willing to sacrifice then eventually we&#8217;ll have savings that we can then use to invest such that we have more income.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Now, for most Americans at this moment in the euphemistically labeled &#8220;business cycle&#8221; Honey&#8217;s response would be: &#8220;But I don&#8217;t know where else we can cut!&#8221; Of course to the conservative there is always something that money is being spent on that is in actuality an indulgence for which one should repent and thus cut from their spending if said spending is greater than one&#8217;s income.  This is true because no righteous individual would ever let the devil of consumption tempt them from the path to wealth heaven.  Redeem one&#8217;s self through the power of restraint of consumption urges.</div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<div>There are multiple things wrong with such a screenplay.  For instance, I&#8217;ve noted in the past that we really do not need banks.  You and I could do everything we want without a bank.  I could build a business even, without a bank.  Granted I could not build it as big and as fast as with working with a bank, but I could build one.  What the bank does is allow one to borrow against the future.  Lending allows the acceleration of the experience and results of the  movement of money.  Certainly that acceleration can result in a loss just as easily as a win, but then that is why we have all sorts of experts in money that can help one make the better odds beating decision such that the acceleration produces a win.  Dear is corrected in that they could do cuts and save and then take the next step.  It was <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093936/" target="_blank">Howard Prescott&#8217;s</a> approach.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We&#8217;re talking about lending here.  Borrowing money.  It is accepted within that part of the conservative ideology which focuses on the concept of money that lending and borrowing are a given.  It is an indisputable fact that such activity exists, is righteous and good.  It is as much a part of the reality of life as oxygen is.  It is a fact of nature.  Nothing could ever be fully realized without lending and borrowing.  Nothing!  Thus banks are a necessity for life it&#8217;s self.  So I hear.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lending and borrowing is so much a part of nature that nature is currently ill and struggling because lending is not happening.  Business can&#8217;t get loans and thus expand resulting in job creation.  At least that is what I have been told.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Businesses can&#8217;t get loans and expand and hire.  Think about that statement and let&#8217;s change the screenplay.  &#8220;Dear, I&#8217;m worried we are missing an opportunity here.  You know our income is not changing and we are adding debt.  If you would just let me borrow some money I could hire someone to help me around the house and buy the tickets to that &#8216;How to make money in real estate&#8217; seminar.  We could apply that knowledge and within a few years be making more money.&#8221;     </div>
<div></div>
<div>Maybe you don&#8217;t think spending money on “How to make money in real estate” is the smart move, but is the proper natural answer to say: &#8220;Honey, you know we have to cut back on our spending and wait until we have saved enough to implement your plan.&#8221; ?  Is the proper natural answer to tell someone to wait until they have saved their money before they decide to get an education?  If your business is auto repair, is the proper answer to tell someone to wait until they have saved their money before they buy the tools needed for fixing cars?  Would RI have been able to implement their emissions testing which required the purchase of dynos by the garages if the answer was: Wait until you have saved the money to buy the dyno?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Of course not.  So this gets to one reason why the conservative concept, government borrowing is the wrong course of action, is it&#8217;s self so wrong never mind completely blasphemous according to their ideology. It is also why, when conservatives are in charge they do not cut and save.  They spend and borrow.  It is natural.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s take Honey&#8217;s and Dear&#8217;s screenplay a little further.  &#8220;But Dear, right now the rates are very low, lower than our mortgage.  Also, the equity we have in the house is about 86%.  I&#8217;ve consulted with the accountant, your friend the business consultant, listened to CNBC, Fox Business and interviewed others regarding &#8216;How to make money in real estate&#8217;.  They all agree, my plan is doable and appears sound.  If we just take about 15% of the equity, invest it in our knowledge and then apply the knowledge we will be doing better.&#8221;</div>
<div></div>
<div>We are now at the stickler of our dear conservative&#8217;s answer.  &#8220;&#8230; I see no possibility for improving our current position&#8230;&#8221;.   This is the part of the answer one has to believe in if you are to accept that the solution is only to cut and save.  This is the part of the answer that completely will not fit, will make you choke, will make you stumble when considering any other scenario related to the dear conservative&#8217;s understanding of nature.  Lending and borrowing is natural, righteous and good.   Do you want to make the banks extinct in nature?  If the answer is to &#8220;cut and save&#8221; then that is the implied desired results if we are to believe &#8220;I see no possibility for improving our current position&#8221;.   Go ahead, try to gel the two concepts.  Try to make your brain hold &#8220;I see no possibility, we must cut and save&#8221; and &#8220;lending and borrowing are natural, righteous and good&#8221; at the same time.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I ask you, be honest.  Which screenplay seems the more likely for Honey and Dear as they sit around the table.  Is it the one where they only cut spending or the one where a plan is laid out and they go to the bank so that they can accelerate the implementation and thus achieve the benefits sooner?    Which plan has the greater potential gain?  And, which one would be considered adding to the nations GDP?  Are the vast majority of the 99% really just sitting back and accepting their lot or are they actually trying to plan and implement the plan?  The simple fact that GDP is growing confirms the latter.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Here is the next thing wrong with the first screenplay but correct about the rewritten screenplay: equity.</div>
<div>At no time is the conservative (Republican or Democratic Party) using that word.  Have your heard anyone talk about the nations equity?  Its assets worth&#8230; net worth?  Even by those who know we need to spend (the freshwater Keynes minded economists) I have not seen it mentioned as part of why we could borrow without fear.  Borrowing is always justified with the rates are low, it would create jobs and grow the economy.  Of course with the subscript caution note of maybe inflation in the future.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>OK, everyone gets that part. Honey got that part.  But, Honey understood it further: equity.  Hell, the reason we had the real estate bubble is because the masses understood equity.  The righteous and good and natural banks pulled a Monsanto genetic manipulation and turned it into a retail product removing it from it&#8217;s natural environment and contaminated everything but, that&#8217;s another story.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Assets.  Tangible or otherwise.  Currently the entire discussion regarding our debt and deficit are all done based on income.  The numbers look huge.   $16.5 trillion in debt.   Deficits to add to the debt in the trillions and only $14 trillion per year to try to pay for it all. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>First, lets get Honey and Dear&#8217;s situation straight.   There is a very large chance as with you and I that  their annual income did not and was in fact much less than the value of the house they purchased.  Second, there are a vast majority of people who have, over 20 plus or minus years have paid off that house or are getting close to doing so with an annual income that is still multiples less than the value of the house.  Get it?  At the same time, that less than the value of the house annual income probably purchased some home improvements adding to the value of the assets?  The income probably purchased some education, adding to the value of the assets?  The income probably purchased some happy time, assuring the value of the knowledge assets?  That less than the value of the house annual income has created assets over time worth more than the annual income.  Multiples more.  But, and lastly there is one major difference between Honey and Dear and We the People nation.  The nation never will retire.  Think about it for a moment.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I have been thinking about the problem with the use of the dinner table discussion as a vehicle for explaining the drive toward deficit reduction.  I know the government is the counter force to all that the private sector does in an economy.  I know about the World Banks report on intangible assets and our wealth creation.  I have noted the 1% income was rising faster than our GDP.  How long do you think that could/can go on, talk about dinner table discussion!   However, the public is in tune with the idea of dinner table discussions and the idea of cutting back to make ends meet at this moment in the “business cycle”.  So what was missing?</div>
<div></div>
<div>The public knows you can&#8217;t spend more than you have at ever greater rates.  I venture that the small business person knows you can&#8217;t take money out of the business faster than you can make it too.  So, to try to convince them that deficit spending is the correct approach becomes the metaphor of spitting into the wind.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>What was missing from the dinner table discussion was the word “equity”. Honey mentioned equity and the entire conversation took on an entirely different perspective.  So, US equity?  What is the value of our assets?  What is our equity?  Have we mortgaged so much of the equity that we can&#8217;t take advantage of nature and borrow?  Of course, if this were the pre-recession period for sure the answer would be no.  In fact, we would be able to borrow over 100% with no money down and no income check.   But, We the People have learned even if banking has not.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>I went looking for equity numbers and found <a href="http://rutledgecapital.com/2009/05/24/total-assets-of-the-us-economy-188-trillion-134xgdp/" target="_blank">this article</a>: Total Assets of the U.S. Economy $188 Trillion  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>The best source of asset market, or balance sheet, information we have today is the document Z1: Flow of Funds of the United States produced after the end of each quarter by the army of economists working at the Federal Reserve Board.</div>
<div>One way to do it is to add up the numbers that we do know. I have done so in line 13. We know there are $141,512 billion in financial assets. We know that just three of those sectors own $46,301 billion in tangible assets. Adding those two numbers together produces a (reported) total asset number of $187,813 billion&#8230;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I&#8217;m not going to argue with or for this persons approach to the calculation.  There are some very good comments there regarding how to calculate the number.  <a href="http://rutledgecapital.com/2009/05/24/total-assets-of-the-us-economy-188-trillion-134xgdp/comment-page-1/#comment-654" target="_blank">One person</a> suggested this method:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>A reasonable tack to estimate the networth of the nation is to use our traditional financial technique of discounting the future predictable cash flows, using a ‘elected’ rate for discounting the cash flows&#8230;.So using this DCF discipline, we can posit that our net worth is about $234T.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>My first house in 1988 was purchased based on this method.  I had $60K in the bank but, based on my income, presto&#8230;I was now worth $250K.  I was smart and only bought the house I knew I could afford, not what my new found wealth suggested.</p>
<p>At <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_in_the_United_States" target="_blank">Wikipedia </a>I learned that in 2008 the UN put our value at $118 trillion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>This is quit the range.  $118 to $234 trillion.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>Let&#8217;s rewrite the screenplay now. Honey convinced Dear that they should borrow the money so now they are talking to the bank. </div>
<div>Natural Bank: “Hello Dear and Honey, how may I help you?”   </div>
<div>Honey responds “Well, we need some money.  Currently our income is $14 trillion dollars and our debt is about $16.5 trillion and we are getting a little behind.  However, we have a plan to borrow some money and use it to improver our income flow.  Here is our business plan”.   </div>
<div>Natural Bank: “Well my quick read of your cover page looks promising, but I will need to let the department study it further.  In the meantime, what are your assets worth, do you have any equity?”</div>
<div>Honey responds: “Yes, based on the latest evaluations for property tax purposes our equity conservatively measured is $118 trillion but based on income flows as high as $234 trillion.  We like to use our own data tables from our accounting software and thus come up with $188 trillion”.</div>
<div>Natural Banker: “My, if this is true then certainly there is room to work with you.  How much were you considering to borrow?  We don&#8217;t get many potential clients such as yourself.  I think we can give you a special rate too!”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Kind of changes the ending of the dinner table discussion doesn&#8217;t it?  Honey and Dear have a debt that is between 7% of equity and 14% of equity.  Natural Bank is normally willing to go 75% of equity.    That gives us somewhere between $88.5 trillion and $175.5 trillion to invest in ourself.  That is money right now we could put to work that, as every Honey and Dear including Honey and Dear Small Business knows, if they invest it with an eye on improving their life, their income from the increased value of the assets will more than pay for the loan.  Also, the investment can only further improve the equity thus reducing the debt to equity ratio.  We&#8217;ll ignore inflation&#8217;s effect on debt.   This also ignores the fact that Dear and Honey are collecting rents from some of their assets that are well below historical market rates.  They were doing some of their friends a favor, unfortunately at their personal expense.</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is one more thing. As noted the nation will never retire.  There is no time in the life of the nation, unlike Honey and Dear where it will not work to produce income.  Never.  That means there is no time in the life of the nation where it will need to rely on savings to pay it&#8217;s bills.   In fact, if the nation decided to do this, it would die.  Kind of like parts of Europe currently.</div>
<div></div>
<div>What do you think?  Are you going to be the Dear that tells Honey &#8220;forget it&#8221;,  just cut your spending until you can save the money?  I think if you do, Honey is going to tell you where to go.  In fact, I believe Honey has been telling Dear where to go for a while based on the polls.  “If only you would just listen to me for once!”</div>

                                <p>Lifted from Robert Waldmann&#8217;s more private thoughts:</p>
<p>I love <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/2012/10/barack-obama/its-not-what-you-say-about-your-issues-its-what-your-issues-say-about-you/#comment-116676">this video</a>.</p>
<p>I agree that it is very odd for Romney to brag about balancing a budget with a 1.5 billion dollar federal bailout. But what exactly does it mean for a manager of a firm to balance a budget ? I’d say the very minimum is to keep the firms you control out of bankruptcy. By this standard Romney is not a budget balancer at all. At Bain he made huge amounts of money relying on limited liability. Several Bain controlled firms went bankrupt. Those were budgets under Romney’s control (sole shareholder CEO and all that) which were as un balanced as budgets can be.</p>
<p>I know I am mixing up budgets and balance sheets. I am doing that to bend over backwards to try to meet Romney half way. Really a corporations budget isn’t balanced if it issues debt. Unbalanced budgets are the key to private equity. Romney’s whole career as a businessman is based on understanding that an obsession with avoiding debt is costly.</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>On this he is consistent in practice as well as being consistently dishonest, since as you note, he proposes a huge increase in the US budget deficit. The approach of loading an entity up with debt and not worrying about what happens if it can’t pay has worked very well for him so far, so why shouldn’t he stick with it_<br />I’m very sorry I wrote an outraged comment on your post critiquing #rateloweringbasebroadening (RLBB)for not critiquing it completely enough. In this video you make the key point that extremely high income people will gain money they sure don’t need from RLBB as they just don’t have deductions on the order of their income (importantly this refers to Romney style RL and maybe a bit of BB (but no details) and things are different if the BB includes raising taxes on capital income and capital gains).</p>
<p>On Gas prices, I note that US consumption is a large fraction of world consumption. A US gas tax probably would cause lower petroleum prices in the medium run (not immediately only after people trade in their SUVs for cars). It makes no sense for a country to pretend it is tiny when it is large. Laissez faire is optimal only when price taking is optimal. In the world petroleum market, the US acts as a monopsony which has no interest in maximizing profits. It’s as if Saudi Arabia ignored the effect of their exports on prices. Of course you know this (you praised Mankiw on the gas tax). Fleet economy standards may be a silly way to do it based on the US obsession with low gas prices, but I suspect that Obama’s policies are causing lower petroleum prices and will eventually cause significantly lower petroleum prices. “There is nothing [more] a US President can do” is true given and only given political limits.</p>
<p>(OK so enough being responsible. Now a dumb joke about a smart guy &#8212; a smart Pollack joke<br />Love the denunciation of rate cutting and base broadening.  You are the most effective populist since  President  Jackson, Pollack.)</p>

                                <p>Art at <a href="http://newarthurianeconomics.blogspot.com/">The New Arthurian Economics</a> and I are looking at the relationship between debt and economic  growth.  Art started with an observation of two FRED series, total  credit market debt owed (TCMDO) and Gross Domestic Product (GDP,   nominal or GDPC1, inflation adjusted &#8211; take your pick.)</p>
<p>Graph 1, from FRED, shows these data series.  I&#8217;ve chosen nominal GDP and, for reference, also included the total Federal Debt.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=bIb"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=bIb" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 1 TCMDO, GDP and Total Federal Debt</div>
<p>In  1950, TCMDO was about 1.3 times GDP, but growing a bit more quickly.   By 1980, the ratio was 1.6, and by 1987 it was greater than 2.  Now that  ratio is approaching 4.  Note that TCMDO is also close to 4 times  greater than total public debt.  This is why Art and I agree that  private, not public debt is the problem that needs to be addressed, but  is largely ignored.</p>
<p>Linked here are Art&#8217;s posts with graphs of YoY growth in both factors, <a href="http://newarthurianeconomics.blogspot.com/2012/10/three-decades-2.html">pre 1980</a> and <a href="http://newarthurianeconomics.blogspot.com/2012/10/three-decades.html">post-1980</a>.   Pre 1980, their moves are similar in magnitude, and pretty well  coordinated. Post 1980 there is still some occasional similarity of  motion, but the coordination breaks down and debt growth is generally  quite a bit higher than GDP growth.  The 80&#8217;s in particular stand out as  being starkly different from the previous period.</p>
<p>Graph 2 shows the entire data set, since 1952.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=bId"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=bId" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 2 YoY % Growth in TCMDO and GDP </div>
<p>These observations led Art to the reasonable hypothesis that, &#8220;Output growth slowed  when debt became excessive.&#8221;  This, in fact, might explain the great stagnation.</p>
<p>I suggested, and Art accepted two corollaries to his hypothesis.</p>
<p>1) There is a non-excessive amount of debt.  Let&#8217;s call it &#8220;just right.&#8221;<br />2) Below the &#8220;just right&#8221; amount, there might also be &#8220;not enough.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually,  there is a lower level hypothesis, to which Art&#8217;s is corollary:  That  there is a functional relationship between debt and growth, in which  growth is the dependent variable.</p>
<p>This is what I will explore in this post. </p>
<p>Graph  3 is a scatter plot of GDP vs TCMDO YoY % change for each, FRED  quarterly data from Q4, 1952 through Q2, 2012, with a best fit straight  line included.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ltbCeg6PZGc/UHY4w91szJI/AAAAAAAACAM/VbLR0ePCKS4/s1600/GDP+vs+TCMDO.jpg"><img border="0" height="272" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ltbCeg6PZGc/UHY4w91szJI/AAAAAAAACAM/VbLR0ePCKS4/s400/GDP+vs+TCMDO.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div>Graph 3 GDP vs TCMDO, YoY % Change</div>
<p>The  relationship is quite clearly positive.  The R^2 value at .39 is rather  low, but not terrible.  There is quite a bit of scatter in the data.   Note the circle of data points around the left end of the line.  More on  that later.</p>
<p>Next, I divided the data by decades, frex,  1961-1970.  This admittedly simplistic data parsing reveals that the  slope and R^2 values are strongly variable over time.  Graph 4 shows the  scatter plot along with the slope and R^2 values for each decade.   These data values are arranged in the chart in chronological order and  color matched with the corresponding data points.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gZ9PGJtwBss/UHbTvxUjDZI/AAAAAAAACAg/mMeq9Tfd_RQ/s1600/GDP+vs+TCMDO+2.jpg"><img border="0" height="262" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-gZ9PGJtwBss/UHbTvxUjDZI/AAAAAAAACAg/mMeq9Tfd_RQ/s400/GDP+vs+TCMDO+2.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 4 GDP vs TCMDO, YoY % Change by Decade</div>
<p>I&#8217;ve  added a brown line connecting the dots for the first decade of this  century.  The chronology proceeds from a cluster near the center of the  graph into a clockwise circular spiral.</p>
<p>Graph 5 shows how the slope and R^2 vary over time.</p>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c90pTkiBAJs/UHbwlp5aIlI/AAAAAAAACA0/jfF0132hGl0/s1600/GDP+vs+TCMDO+Slope+Over+Time.jpg"><img border="0" height="250" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-c90pTkiBAJs/UHbwlp5aIlI/AAAAAAAACA0/jfF0132hGl0/s400/GDP+vs+TCMDO+Slope+Over+Time.jpg" width="400"></a></div>
<div> Graph 5 Slope and R^2 Over Time for GDP vs TCMDO</div>
<p>After  the 60&#8217;s, the slope plummets, and by the 80&#8217;s R^2 is a laughable  0.035.  Though the slope has remained low, R^2 has since recovered to  0.38, which is near the whole data set value of 0.39, and only slightly  less than the 0.40 to 0.44 of the first three decades.</p>
<p>The  slope changes can be interpreted as generally less GDP bang for the  TCMDO buck, as the TCMDO/GDP ratio increases.  This is totally  consistent with Art&#8217;s hypothesis.</p>
<p>I have more to say about the GDP -TCMDO relationship, but this post is getting long, so I&#8217;ll save it for a follow-up.</p>
<p>For now, I&#8217;ll close with a few questions.</p>
<p>1) Do you think we&#8217;re on to something?<br />2) What do you think of the methodology?<br />3) &#8220;Excessive debt&#8221; is suggestive, but non-specific.  How should this concept be quantized?<br />4) How should I go at exploring corollaries 1 and 2 mentioned after Graph 2?<br />5) Any thoughts on what was there about the 80&#8217;s that blew up the prior debt &#8211; GDP relationship?<br />6) Is there such a thing as productive vs non-productive debt, and how would they be characterized?</p>
<p>I look forward to your constructive comments.</p>

<p>and made this comment.</p>
<blockquote><div>Second, a dramatic rise in household debt, which many of us now believe lies at the heart of our continuing depression. </div>
</blockquote>
<p>There are those who seem to believe that if Krugman says it, it must be wrong.   Here is Scott Sumner&#8217;s<a href="http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?p=15389"> reaction</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>What do you see?  I suppose it’s in the eye of the beholder, but I see  three big debt surges:  1952-64, 1984-91, and 2000-08.  The first debt  surge was followed by a golden age in American history; the boom of  1965-73.  The second debt surge was followed by another golden age, the  boom of 1991-2007.  And the third was followed by a severe recession.   What was different with the third case?  The Fed adopted a tight money  policy that caused NGDP growth to crash, which in turn sharply raised  the W/NGDP ratio.  <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/17/nominally-legal/" target="_blank">Krugman has another recent post</a> that shows further evidence of the importance of sticky wages.  Forget about debt and focus on NGDP.  It’s NGDP instability that creates problems, not debt surges.</p></blockquote>
<p>Bold emphasis is provided by Marcus Nunes, who <a href="http://thefaintofheart.wordpress.com/2012/07/18/to-really-understand-the-depression-we-have-to-stop-pulling-red-herrings-from-the-hat/">goes on to say:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Why does the share of debt rise? I believe it reflects peoples  “optimism” about future prospects. In the chart below I break down  Krugman´s chart and separate mortgage and non-mortgage household debt as  a share of NGDP. I also add the behavior of the stock market (here  represented by the Dow-Jones Index).</p></blockquote>
<p>[See the linked Nunes post for his chart.] </p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>Eye of the beholder, indeed.  Nunes makes an expectations-based argument, and adds:<br />
<blockquote>Non-mortgage debt remains relatively stable after 1965, fluctuating in the range of 17% to 22% of NGDP. No problem there. </p></blockquote>
<p>But the reality is that non-mortgage debt has grown quasi-exponentially in the post WW II period.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=9Dw"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=9Dw" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Sumner, as always, beats the NGDP drum.  </p>
<p>My friend Art <a href="http://newarthurianeconomics.blogspot.com/2012/07/marcus-debt-is-red-herring.html">takes a jaundiced view of the Sumner-Nunes interpretation</a>.   He gets it exactly right.  To see why, let&#8217;s go back and have a look at  the data.  Here is straight CMDEBT (Household Credit Market Debt  Outstanding,) presented as YoY percent change &#8211; not distorted by a GDP  divisor.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=9AN"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=9AN" width="400"></a></div>
<p>Sumner  sees a debt surge from 1952 to 1964.  I see a secular decrease in the  YoY rate of debt growth from over 15% to under 5% by about 1966.</p>
<p>Sumner  sees a debt surge from 1984 to 1991.  I see a decrease in the YoY rate  of debt growth from over 15% to about 5% over that same span. </p>
<p>Sumner  sees a debt surge from 2000 to 2008.  I see a modest rise into a broad  peak between 2003 and 2006, with a net decrease in the rate of debt  growth over the 2000 to 2007 period.  In CY 2008 debt growth goes  negative.  Here&#8217;s a close-up view.</p>
<p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=9AO"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=9AO" width="400"></a></div>
<p>So much for optimism-fueled debt growth.  </p>
<p>Between  the non-existent debt surges Sumner sees a golden age from 1965 to  1973.  I&#8217;m a bit puzzled by a golden age boom that straddles one  recession and leads directly into another; though I will admit that  average GDP growth then looks impressive compared to the GDP growth of  the last decade.  But the thing that Sumner misses within his &#8220;golden  age&#8221; is the big debt surge from 1971 to 1974.  </p>
<p>By my reckoning, Sumner is incapable of identifying either a debt surge or an economic boom.   </p>
<p>So  what is going on here?  Sumner and Nunes either fail to realize or  deliberately ignore that the quantity CMDEBT/GDP has a denominator.   Let&#8217;s look at GDP.  Here is YoY GDP growth over the post WW II period.   And, of course, this is NGDP &#8211; not inflation adjusted &#8211; the very  quantity to which Sumner ascribes so much gravitas.</p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=9AP"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=9AP" width="400"></a></div>
<p>The average GDP growth over the period 1948 to 2007 is 7.04%<br />The average over the &#8220;debt surge&#8221; period 1952 to 1964 is 5.35%<br />The average over the  &#8220;debt surge&#8221; period 1984 to 1991 is 6.85%<br />The average over the  &#8220;debt surge&#8221; period 2000 to 2007 is 5.24%</p>
<p>What  we have are three periods of below average GDP growth, two of them  substantially so.  The middle one is only slightly below average, but  that is misleading since there is a steep decline in GDP growth over the  period.</p>
<p>Consider C = A/B.  If B is small or  decreasing, it will tend to make C large or increasing.  To ascribe all  of the changes in C to changes in A is to ignore that Ol&#8217; Devil  Denominator.   </p>
<p>Sumner does bring up NGDP growth late  in the passage quoted above, but I don&#8217;t get his point.  If I&#8217;m reading  him correctly, he claims that NGDP growth crashed between 2000 and 2008,  and that caused the Debt/GDP ratio to rise.  But NGDP growth was  sharply up from 2001 to 2003, relatively steady through 2006, and never  crashed until 2008.  If there is any sense in his argument, somebody  will have to explain it to me.    </p>
<p>What actually  happened was a real debt surge &#8211; but it was between 1997 and 2004.   Meanwhile, GDP growth both before and after the 2000-2003 dip was around  6 to 7%.  Then, in 2006, household debt growth and GDP growth both  started to slump, and in 2008 took a nose dive together.</p>
<p>Sumner  and Nunes have made a very fundamental error &#8211; not so much in the math  itself as in the application of logic.  This is sloppy thinking, and any  conclusions drawn from it must be highly suspect.</p>
<p>To get a handle on what is really going on, let&#8217;s look at debt growth and GDP growth together.</p>
<div><a href="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=9C6"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://research.stlouisfed.org/fredgraph.png?g=9C6" width="400"></a></div>
<p>  <br />They  don&#8217;t move in lock-step, but the similarity is striking.  Specifically,  every recession except 2001 corresponds exactly to a minimum in debt growth.  So Sumner&#8217;s advice to &#8220;<i>forget about debt</i>&#8221;  looks like it&#8217;s missing something very important &#8211; specifically that  the household component of spending [aka GDP growth] has been debt  financed.  To put it in context, have a look at Krugman&#8217;s first graph in  the article linked above.   It shows what we all know, but some chose  to ignore &#8211; that median wages have stagnated for 40 years.</p>
<p>In  my narrative, the reason household debt grew to almost 100% of GDP is  that stagnating incomes have not been able to support the cost of the  American life style &#8211; due to decades of inflation, but probably largely  driven by the costs of health care and education.  Remember &#8211; contra the  prevailing view of economists today &#8211; spending, and therefore GDP  growth, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/04/another-look-at-wealth-and-consumption.html">is directly dependent on income, not on wealth</a>.  </p>
<p>Debt  is a useful tool that develops into a problem when it becomes too  burdensome to service.  Looking at debt as a percentage of GDP provides a  clue as to how serviceable the debt is.  When you also consider that  all of the GDP growth over several decades has gone to the top income  earners, you can see that the debt servicing problem is made that much  worse for the average person.  </p>
<p>Nunes thinks debt rises  when people are optimistic about the future, and he weaves a narrative  based on that idea.  He then blames the 2008 collapse on bad policy,  including a contractionary Fed.   He appears to want spending growth,  but refuses to recognize the exhausted ability of ordinary people to  spend.</p>
<p>In my view &#8211; and I think the data supports it &#8211;  Krugman and Art have this exactly right.  And, as is nearly always the  case, those who disagree with PK on what is happening in the real word  have to invent a fantasy-world explanation &#8211; or, if I can borrow an  especially tortured metaphor from Nunes,  <i>pull a red herring out of a hat</i>.</p>

                                <p>Talk is called &#8220;<a href="http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/2011/09/16/new-york-talk-roosevelt-hotel-friday-23rd/">Neat, Plausible, and Wrong: the Deluded Discipline of Economics</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>I have to quibble with the &#8220;plausible&#8221; portion: there is no possible way to rationalize contemporary Microeconomics with any reasonable conceit that the Macroeconomics produced are &#8220;first-best&#8221; or anything similar.*</p>
<p>I doubt I&#8217;ll be there at 5:00, but certainly by 6:00.  Hope to see some of you there.</p>
<p>Any questions for Professor Keen can be emailed to me or put in comments.</p>
<p>*This may be the root of my disagreement with Brad DeLong, who learned Macro and Micro when it was still possible—barely—to envision a GUT of Economics, even in a (weak form, as it were) Arrow-Debreu world.  In the past thirty years, the strange delusion that Arrow-Debreu actually <em>reflects</em> the world has come to dominant Micro—with the rather predictable adverse consequence that Macro has to be more-than-the-sum-of-the-parts—i.e., include a positive social aspect—to be the best of all posible current worlds. But a positive social aspect is not part of the NeoKeynesian** cant, so you end up, effectively, declaring (for instance) that Gary Becker is wrong and discrimination is a beneficial business practice.</p>
<p>**As I have noted before, in economics the phrase &#8220;neo&#8221; is added to the front of a word if you are putting forth a belief set that is diametrically opposed to what came before: neoClassical and neoKeynesian are the most obvious examples of this.</p>

<div>(This is a long post.  The time for sound bite debate to the demise of learned discussion is over for we are flirting with danger.)  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Via a post at<a href="http://www.financialarmageddon.com/2011/08/hand-in-hand.html"> Financial Armageddon</a> I learnt of a paper looking at the relationship of austerity implementation and social unrest.  It is recent, dated August 2011.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://www.voxeu.org/sites/default/files/file/DP8513.pdf">Austerity and Anarchy: Budget Cuts and Social Unrest in Europe</a>, 1919-2009 </div>
<div>Jacopo Ponticelli, Universitat Pompeu Fabra</div>
<div>Hans-Joachim Voth, UPF-ICREA, CREI and CEPR</div>
<div>Discussion Paper No. 8513</div>
<div>August 2011</div>
<div>Centre for Economic Policy Research</div>
<div></div>
<div>The Financial Armageddon article shows the first chart of the paper which presents:<i>  the relationship between fiscal adjustment episodes and the number of incidents indicating instability (CHAOS).</i></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>  </div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_v1RnWfwQQw/TkqWMx894MI/AAAAAAAAARY/APzmU3rfTak/s1600/Austerity+vs+Instability+chart+8-15-11.JPG" imageanchor="1"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_v1RnWfwQQw/TkqWMx894MI/AAAAAAAAARY/APzmU3rfTak/s320/Austerity+vs+Instability+chart+8-15-11.JPG" width="320"></a></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>  </div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;CHAOS is the sum of demonstrations, riots, strikes, assassinations, and attempted revolutions in a</div>
<div>single year in each country. The first set of five bars show the frequencies conditional on the size of budget cuts. When expenditure is increasing, the average country-year unit of observation in our data registers less than 1.5 events. When expenditure cuts reach 1% or more of GDP, this grows to nearly 2 events, a relative increase by almost a third compared to the periods of budget expansion. As cuts intensify, the frequency of disturbances rises. Once austerity measures involve expenditure reductions by 5% or more, there are more than 3 events per year and country &#8212; twice as many as in times of expenditure increases.&#8221;  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>This is a rather disturbing chart.  Certainly the recent events in England play into the subject of this paper.   That WE are now setup for our version of austerity implementation, this paper should be put in the hands of all the staff members of congress and the president.   If I had my own national news show I would have in the corner of the screen the above chart along with the google map of all the riot locations in London and in big letters: Cut SS, MC, Medicaid.  Really? You want to go there?</div>
<div></div>
<div>There is more to this paper than just the apparent connection between austerity and upheaval.<i>  &#8220;Controlling for economic growth does not change our results. This suggests that we capture more than the general association between economic downturns and unrest.&#8221;</i></div>
<div></div>
<div>This is the most powerful statement of the paper.  It implies that &#8220;Man&#8221; in all his glory is responsible for such social activity.  It is not the<a href="http://draft.blogger.com/.%20http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/big-washington-consensus-lie-by-david.html"> &#8220;natural&#8221; course</a> of economic activity that creates such volatile activity.  It is the<a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/big-washington-consensus-lie-by-david.html"> economic policy implemented</a>that determines whether there will be unrest or not.  Currently, the proposed austerity is based on an a priori of &#8220;we&#8217;re broke&#8221;.  It is stated with the authority of natural cause.  Mother Nature Economy did it&#8217;s thing and well&#8230;we&#8217;re broke.  All we can do is rebuild after the storm.   Yet, an economy is totally of human design.  The republican who stated that the conservative movement was making reality was more correct than their fantasizing of control and power would allow them to realize.  Thus I delve into this paper more after the jump.  </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<hr xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">  
<div>There are two points that need to be understood if we are to apply the lessons of this social economic paper.  Point 1:</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;However, countries with very high levels of constraints on the executive show a weaker degree of association&#8230;Table 10 demonstrates that in countries with better institutions, the responsiveness of unrest to budget cuts is generally lower. Where constraints on the executive are minimal, the coefficient on expenditure changes is strongly negative – more spending buys a lot of social peace.”</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>So, some kind of governance that includes self determination is a mechanism for minimizing upheaval/unrest.  I believe the American Revolution would be an example of upheaval in the face of “minimal executive” constraint.  Finding that constraint of the executive is determinative does not mean such rights are exercised by the people to their benefit:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;The political economy literature on austerity suggests a paradox. There is no significant punishment at the polls for governments pursuing cut-backs (Alesina, Perotti, and Tavares 1998; Alesina, Carloni, and Lecce 2010), and no evidence of gains in response to budget expansion (Brender and A. Drazen</div>
<div>2008).&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I don&#8217;t know what to make of such findings.  Certainly there must be more in the details of the studies sited.  If such lack of response by the electorate is true, then we are in deeper trouble than realized.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>Based on this conclusion, the authors ask: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;Why, then, is fiscal consolidation often delayed, or only implemented half-heartedly?&#8221; </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>They suggest fear of unrest may be the reason and footnote the following: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>14 Alesina, Carloni and Lecce (2010) also suggest that implementation of budget measures may be harder if the burden falls disproportionately on some groups.  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I would hate to think that austerity measures are not implemented simply because of fear of a reprisal that appears to be short lived with no political loss to those implementing the policy  instead of not implementing austerity because research and experience prove it to be actually harmful in it&#8217;s results and even contradictory to the desired outcome of greater prosperity with reduced risk of living.  If the politico is acting based on the former, it show&#8217;s no conviction of ideology and philosophy.  If they fail to acted based on the latter, it shows a lack of character of inquiry and enlightenment.   In either case, Naomi Kline&#8217;s work notes that austerity is always implemented with some form of force.  In our country the force appears to be consolidation and control of the media combined with massive amounts of spending thus control of the debate and knowledge of the subject matter.  Though the police state is in place thanks to Bush/Cheney and the expansion under Obama. </div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>Point 2:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>“Further, we examine if the spread of mass media changes the probability of unrest. This is not the case. If anything, higher levels of media availability and a more developed telecommunications infrastructure reduce the strength of the mapping from budget cuts to instability.&#8221;</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>In their conclusion they flatly state: <i>Contrary to what might be expected, we also find no evidence that the spread of mass media facilitates the rise of mass protests.   </i></div>
<div></div>
<div>This suggests that cutting communications as some have done recently in an attempt to curb the upheaval is not a procedure that works in the long term.  The focus of the complaint, materialized via upheaval will have to be addressed.  It is not the ease of rallying the masses, the pep squad going viral that solely explains the materialization or degree of unrest.  Though it may explain the reduction in strength of austerity implementation and resulting upheaval.  I think the authors have stumbled upon the modern version of the printing press coming into existence and the effects it had.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The authors review current literature on the subject and find there is some confliction as to the effects of budget cutting.  I&#8217;ll let you read it, but my take home is that it depends on what stage of national development the country is in as to the extent  austerity will produce unrest, if the unrest is sustained post implementation and whether it promotes growth.  They even site:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Giavazzi and Pagano (1990) and Alesina et al. (2002) find that cuts can be expansionary. Amongst the reasons suggested for this finding are a reduction in uncertainty about the course future spending (Blanchard 1990a), and a positive wealth shock as a result of lower taxes in the future (Bertola and Drazen 1993).3  </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>I guess we know where the current meme comes from.  Unfortunately the authors also note:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>IMF interventions, on the other hand, often led to more frequent disturbances (Morrison, Lafay, and Dessus 1994).</div>
<div>Similarly, Haggard, Lafay and Morrison (1995) find that IMF interventions and monetary contractions in developing countries led to greater instability.</div>
<div>Recently, work by the IMF has suggested that austerity measures may be less expansionary than previously thought; they may well have the standard negative Keynesian effects as a result of lower demand (IMF 2010; Pescatori, Leigh, and Guajardo 2011).</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Oh no!  What is the IMF going to do now?  I&#8217;m still praying for you Greece.   </div>
<div></div>
<div>The author&#8217;s sum up the literature review with:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div><u>Remarkably, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no systematic analysis of how budget cuts affect the level of social instability and unrest in a broad cross-section of developed countries, over a long period.</u></div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Wouldn&#8217;t you think that such research would be considered key to one&#8217;s knowledge base before we start implementing policy that to date has been mostly tried and studied in 3rd world situations?   Wouldn&#8217;t you think that the advising  </div>
<div>the proof of effectiveness from these advising economist?  Even medicine has acknowledged there is a difference between men and women other than genital development.  The review of literature is clear.  Start cutting and you will piss people off such that they express it ultimately in violent means though if you can ride it out the violence abates and prosperity looms until it doesn&#8217;t because people just plain have no money.  The word for today is: Demand.  Use it in a sentence as it relates to this discussion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We can think that there are other issues involved when people protest, but the authors make it clear, austerity brings out the greatest number of people.  For those considering how to handle the masses when the austerity gets implemented:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>&#8220;The simple correlations suggest that these co-movements do not extend to all indicators of unrest equally – riots, revolutions, and demonstrations decline as expenditure rises, but assassinations and strikes seem – at a first pass – uncorrelated. Similarly, output growth seems to correlate negatively with assassinations, riots, revolutions, and demonstrations, but not with strikes.&#8221; </div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>And: &#8220;This suggests that unrest reacts particularly strongly to budget cuts and growth when unrest levels are already high.”</div>
<div></div>
<div>Go ahead, implement at your own imperil.  In case you think this connection of unrest/upheaval is related to how they measure it, the authors checked that variable: <i>&#8220;We conclude that the way in which we measure unrest does not matter for our main finding.&#8221;</i></div>
<div></div>
<div>Looking at the relationship of austerity policy involving taxes: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>Higher taxes and lower expenditure are associated with more unrest, but the relationship is not significant.  Tax increases have a positive sign, but the effect is not significant at standard levels of rejection (column 2). It is also small – a one standard deviation rise in the tax/GDP ratio increases unrest by less than 0.01 events. Overall, we find that improvements in the budget balance raise the level of unrest (column 3). As the results in columns (1) and (2) make clear, this reflects the impact of expenditure cuts, <i><u>and not of tax increases.</u></i></div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>And:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>We find the same results as before – expenditure cuts wreak havoc, tax increases do so only to a small extent and insignificantly. Overall, the budget balance matters for predicting unrest.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>Just to make sure no one gets this wrong:  A change in budget balance predicts unrest if the balance is reduced via cuts.  Kind of makes it difficult to accept that the masses want something for nothing.  In fact, I would suggest “entitlement” as it has come to mean something for nothing is the wrong word to apply to government programs of which people pay for willingly via taxes and don&#8217;t get riotous if they are asked to pay more.</div>
<div></div>
<div>If we wanted to avoid the upheaval of austerity implementation we should consider: </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>In all specifications, the effect of GDP growth on unrest is negative. In contrast to the results for expenditure changes, the effect is not tightly estimated, except in the case of demonstrations, when it is also large – every 1% increase in GDP cuts the number of demonstrations by close to 0.4 events.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div>See, do something that actually improves the economy and people don&#8217;t protest!  Wow, who&#8217;d a thunk it?  Of course improving the economy such that people do not protest would mean having implemented something which produces an actually experienced improvement in the peoples lives.  Something like real rising wages paralleling productivity rise and thus rising wealth.  Unlike say, debt driven consumption only to have financing go away and then told to suck it up.</div>
<div></div>
<div>They look further at the connection of spending cuts vs economic growth and find:  </div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>In contrast, if expenditure changes are negative, they matter a great deal for unrest, driving up CHAOS by 0.19 incidents for each standard deviation of expenditure cuts. Next, we repeat the exercise for output changes. Increases in output do much to cut unrest (col. 3), with a one standard deviation increase in output (3.77%) reducing CHAOS by 0.2 incidents on average. In contrast, declines do not set off major disruptions to the same degree. Overall, the results in table 12 confirm that the relevant identifying variation for expenditure changes comes from cuts; for output changes, it comes from positive growth, not recessions.</div>
</blockquote>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>This  paper kind of makes you think about our current governance of Wall Street/Corp influence and apparent dominance of policy choices to the exclusion of polls showing people want no cuts in programs referred to as entitlements and instead have the budget balanced via tax revenue enhancement.  Wonder what happens when virtual people known as corporations do not experience austerity yet have persuading influence over We the people&#8217;s choices via money into the election process.? I guess we are going to find out.  As I have heard in the past: tort is the free market response to lax governance of the market.  Is upheaval the same free market response to unresponsive policy toward the people?</div>
<div></div>
<div>My concern is that the initial response by those supporting and promoting austerity will be the furthering of the police state we have been developing since 9/11.  Only it will also be fired up (pun intended) domestically.  It is the response we have experienced in the past with the civil rights motion and even back to the labor movement.  It appears that a police response is always the first response to protest as protest is interpreted as potentially criminal regardless of what the Constitution reads.  Yet here we have a paper suggesting that all of it can be avoided.  Combining this paper with the <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2007/10/human-capital-is-where-its-at.html">2005 World Bank report </a>on what creates wealth in a developed economy it appears to me that we have  in our hands the answer to what appropriate economic policy should look like for our current situation.  </div>
<div></div>
<div>I asked <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/09/can-we-please-broaden-our-thinking-in.html">September 2008</a> if we could please broaden our discussion regarding the crisis.  That has not happened.  The discussion is still disjointed, segmented and narrow.  Now I&#8217;m imploring that we broaden the discussion.  Pleading! </div>

                                <p>The <a href="http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/international/trade/2011/trad0611.htm">bad news of the day</a> is that about $5B ($5,000,000,000) more than previously believed went to buy goods made in China, Japan, non-major South and Central American countries, and other places outside the U.S. Per the Vampire Squid (tm Matt Taibbi), this should cause <a href="http://investmentwatchblog.com/q2-gdp-to-be-second-consecutive-sub-1-print-following-surge-in-trade-deficit/">a revision to Q2 US GDP from 1.3% to 0.9%</a>.</p>
<p>The good news of the day is that weekly unemployment claims were <a href="http://www.dol.gov/opa/media/press/eta/ui/eta20111190.htm">&#8220;only&#8221; 395,000</a>. (Let&#8217;s ignore the detail that last week was originally reported as 398K—<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/07/16-weeks-old-enough-to-drive-not.html">breaking the streak</a>—but is now 402K.)</p>
<p>The net result, at least as of 2:00pm is that the major equity indices are <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?q=INDEXDJX:.DJI#">up by at least 3.80%</a> (DJIA). The early articles claim that was <a href="http://www.thestatecolumn.com/articles/us-stock-market-djia-rebound-after-labor-department-report/">because of the &#8220;good&#8221; news</a>.<br />

</p>
<p>
<br />And the scary thing is, they&#8217;re correct. In the 193 weeks since the recession started,* there have only been 39 where initial claims were below 395,000, and two (including the current, possibly-to-be-revised week) that were at that level.</p>
<p>But, especially as <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/post/congressional-super-committee-should-focus-on-jobs/2011/03/03/gIQAuWbn8I_blog.html">none of Harry Reid&#8217;s appointees to The Grand Ripoff appear to believe that Jobs would do more good for balancing the budget than the Super Commission</a>, it appears that three-quarters of that August body will be working solely on the numerator, not the denominator, of the Debt/GDP ratio.</p>

                                <p>By: Daniel Becker <br />There is some <a href="http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/2011/06/budget_cuts.html">new information</a> from Adam Hersh of Center for American Progress showing what has happened in the states that have followed the conservative economic approach (yes, talking to you Obama, DLC, Clintonites).  Keep cutting at your own risk.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the thing.  Like the Wile E Coyote, we seem to have run off the cliff.  Our feet are still moving like we are running because we have not noticed we are off the cliff.   Or I should say those in the lofty parts of our power house and economy have not noticed.   Now, in cartoons, sometimes the charater makes the realization and can scramble back to safety at the edge of the cliff.  However,  Wile E never did get it and always fell.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not interested in being taken down by Senator, Represenative, President, Chairman Wile E Coyote.  No thank you.  I know we&#8217;re off the cliff as do the vast majority of not only the USA but it seems the rest of the 1st world nations.  So listen up Wile E.  We&#8217;re not following you any more ( I hear you Greek patrons).  Not going to try to catch that road runner your way anymore.   And here is why:</p>
<p><a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>Relative to national economic trends, states that increased spending enjoyed on average: <br />0.2 percentage point decrease in the unemployment rate <br />1.4 percent increase in private employment <br />0.5 percent real economic growth since the start of the recession. </p>
<p>In contrast, states that cut spending saw on average:<br />1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate <br />2.1 percent loss of private employment <br />2.9 percent real economic contraction relative to the national economic trend.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, I hope the IMF is happy now.  I have to be honest, the study does note: <br />
<blockquote>The three figures presented in the accompanying charts demonstrate that steep state government spending cuts have gone hand-in-hand with rising unemployment, falling private-sector payroll employment, and lower real growth in states&#8217; gross domestic product, or GDP—the sum of all goods and services produced by labor and equipment in each state, minus imports. <em>The analysis, however, does not tell us whether the spending cuts caused the negative economic outcomes.</em> <strong>But in all three cases, steep spending cuts are statistically associated with markedly worse economic performance.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>There are some nice charts at the linked article if you are more visual.  Personally, I feel this new info just further supports <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/06/monetary-policy-im-not-only-not-feeling.html">my position</a> that people are not drowning (debt is not money and thus not water), they are dehydrating.  We need more of the water that already exists.  It&#8217;s the income inequality issue.  I am rather certain that more government cutting has no chance, zero chance of reversing the inequality.  </p>
<p>If we can&#8217;t reverse the inequality, then we&#8217;re going to continue with what <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2008/12/income-distribution-and-gdp-it-matters.html">I pointed out in 2008</a>.  That is, the top is taking money from the economy as income faster than the economy can produce it.  Can you keep spending more than you make?  No, is the conservative answer.  Well, can you keep taking it faster than you can produce it?  No, is the liberal/progressive answer.  </p>
<p>The issue is not that we are spending too much via government because the government is not just another player in the economy.  As I have noted, as long as the government acts counter to the players in the economy and does so in a manor that assures equality and the reduction of risk in living, it is not a competitor.  It does not &#8220;crowd out&#8221; the private sector.  </p>
<p>This leaves the real issue of a stalling economy, and declining living security one of  to much money being taken out of the economy.  For decades as noted, one group has been taking too much money out of the economy and have been doing it at ever increasing rates: the top 1%.  They are doing it faster than the economy can produce it.  This, as far as I am concerned is no different than government cutting spending.  Either way, money is taken out.  Velocity is what we are talking; how much and how fast money is moving through the economy.   Of course to understand such, one has to appreciate that Wall Street, banks, and markets are not an economy.  This is why the government, acting to fulfill it&#8217;s prime purpose of equality of power is never a competitior in the economy.</p>
<p>So, how convienent the conservative issue is debt.  Too much of it they say.  Too much spending.  HA!  The real debt is in the lack of income to everyone other than those in the top 1%.  They took and are taking so much money out of the system in the form of income (decrease union membership, tax cuts, off shoring, financialization, consolidation) that they have damaged the machine which allowed them to have growing income.  This is the real debt.  It is the lack of economic growth.  And the rich have caused it.  Yet there solution is to cut government spending and further reduce the amount of money in the active (remember velocity) part of the economy all the while taking even more out as income in their pockets?</p>
<p>Do you see how nuts Wile E Coyote is?<br /> </p>

                                <p>Traditionally, non-commercial banking (i.e., everything except savings deposits and consumer loans) was about one of two things:
<ol>
<li>Tax arbitrage or</li>
<li>Regulatory arbitrage
<p>The rest is window dressing; that is, it was basic financial intermediation, usually for the purpose of helping Corporate and/or High Net Worth clients.*</p>
<p>That was until the late 1990s and the Noughts, when the third level came to liquidity-prominence:</p>
</li>
<li>Credit rating arbitrage</li>
</ol>
<p>The third is the most chimerical of all, becausemdash;unless you&#8217;re selling to or buying from the company that is involved (which has correlation issues, as I noted long ago)—neither party (in theory) has control over the outcome of events.  It&#8217;s asymmetric information on <em>both</em> sides: not so much gambling against the house as shooting craps in the alley, not certain whether there is a bobby down the block.<br /><a name="more"></a><br />All of which is an indirect way of saying:  <a href="http://streetlightblog.blogspot.com/2011/06/indirect-us-exposure-to-euro-debt.html">Go Read Kash Mansori</a>.  Especially if you think US institutions are managing better than the EU is. (Hint: it may be true on the governance level, but <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;rls=com.microsoft%3A*&#038;biw=1259&#038;bih=594&#038;q=US+bank+exposure+to+Greek+default&#038;btnG=Search&#038;aq=f&#038;aqi=&#038;aql=&#038;oq=">the financial institutions&#8217;s exposure appears to tell another story</a>.)<br />

</p>
<p>*Think corporate deposits, lines of credit, commercial loans, IPOs that are often used in part to pay off debt, and the like.  Normal course of business options, with the selection influenced by tax or regulatory considerations.</p>
