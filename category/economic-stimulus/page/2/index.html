<p>In a previous post I made a stab at explaining the differences in Republican and Democratic responses to the economics of stimulus by an appeal to differences in world view. With limited success due I think to my not developing my major premise. Here I want to back up a little and explore the very different ways right and left define &#8216;freedom&#8217;. I want to assert that the modern right draws their definition from Milton Friedman while the left fundamentally looks to FDR. Contrasting quotes and some commentary below the fold.<br />From the right we have their secular saint Milton Friedman <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Capitalism-Freedom-Phoenix-Milton-Friedman/dp/0226264017">Capitalism and Freedom</a> excerpted here <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ipe/friedman.htm">Chapter I: The Relation between Economic Freedom and Political Freedom</a> (bolding mine)<br />
<blockquote>The citizen of the United States who is compelled by law to devote something like 10 per cent of his income to the purchase of a particular kind of retirement contract, administered by the government, is being deprived of a corresponding part of his personal freedom. How strongly this deprivation may be felt and its closeness to the deprivation of religious freedom, which all would regard as &#8220;civil&#8221; or &#8220;political&#8221; rather than &#8220;economic&#8221;, were dramatized by an episode involving a group of farmers of the Amish sect. On grounds of principle, this group regarded compulsory federal old age programs as an infringement of their personal individual freedom and refused to pay taxes or accept benefits. As a result, some of their livestock were sold by auction in order to satisfy claims for social security levies. True, the number of citizens who regard compulsory old age insurance as a deprivation of freedom may be few, but the believer in freedom has never counted noses.</p></blockquote>
<p>and here (note when Friedman uses &#8216;liberal&#8217; he means classical economic liberal, these days we would probably use something like &#8216;libertarian&#8217; or &#8216;economic conservative&#8217;)<br />
<blockquote>As liberals, we take freedom of the individual, or perhaps the family, as our ultimate goal in judging social arrangements. Freedom as a value in this sense has to do with the interrelations among people; it has no meaning whatsoever to a Robinson Crusoe on an isolated island (without his Man Friday). Robinson Crusoe on his island is subject to &#8220;constraint,&#8221; he has limited &#8220;power,&#8221; and he has only a limited number of alternatives, but there is no problem of freedom in the sense that is relevant to our discussion. Similarly, in a society freedom has nothing to say about what an individual does with his freedom; it is not an all-embracing ethic. Indeed, a major aim of the liberal is to leave the ethical problem for the individual to wrestle with. The &#8220;really&#8221; important ethical problems are those that face an individual in a free society &#8211; what he should do with his freedom. There are thus two sets of values that a liberal will emphasize &#8212; the values that are relevant to relations among people, which is the context in which he assigns first priority to freedom; and the values that are relevant to the individual in the exercise of his freedom, which is the realm of individual ethics and philosophy.</p></blockquote>
<p> So to Friedman while the free man was not autonomous, he is no Robinson Crusoe, on the other hand freedom is explicitly equated with individualism with possible (but interestingly not necessary) extension to the family. In this world view &#8216;Me First&#8217; becomes a first principle.</p>
<p>Now the modern liberal (which for Friedman equates roughly to &#8216;socialist&#8217;) takes a much different view of freedom. Instead we would appeal to Franklin Roosevelt&#8217;s State of the Union Speech from 1941.<br />
<blockquote>In the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms.</p>
<p>The first is freedom of speech and expression &#8212; everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The second is freedom of every person to worship God in his own way &#8212; everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants &#8212; everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>The fourth is freedom from fear, which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor &#8212; anywhere in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p> I submit that there is no way to fundamentally reconcile these two world views. You can believe that freedom is ideally marked by an individual operating in the marketplace<br />
<blockquote>Fundamentally, there are only two ways of co-ordinating the economic activities of millions. One is central direction involving the use of coercion&#8211;the technique of the army and of the modern totalitarian state. The other is voluntary co-operation of individuals&#8211;the technique of the market place.</p></blockquote>
<p> or you can believe that freedom is a societal responsibility not realized until no one anywhere is lacking in healthy sustenance. Friedman is not a monster, indeed he considers the market the best mechanism to create the greatest good for greatest number outcome:<br />
<blockquote>So long as effective freedom of exchange is maintained, the central feature of the market organization of economic activity is that it prevents one person from interfering with another in respect of most of his activities. The consumer is protected from coercion by the seller because of the presence of other sellers with whom he can deal. The seller is protected from coercion by the consumer because of other consumers to whom he can sell. The employee is protected from coercion by the employer because of other employers for whom he can work, and so on. And the market does this impersonally and without centralized authority.</p>
<p>Indeed, a major source of objection to a free economy is precisely that it does this task so well. It gives people what they want instead of what a particular group thinks they ought to want. Underlying most arguments against the free market is a lack of belief in freedom itself.</p></blockquote>
<p> Well despite the popular stereotype of liberals as being mushyheaded kumbaya types we tend to be a lot more hard headed than this. We do not see a lot of historical evidence that markets prevent coercion, nor do we see that there really is totally free mobility of labor, in particular many of us see employer paid health insurance precisely as a device to prevent labor mobility and indirectly to suppress wages. Where Friedman sees individuals cooperating on an even playing field we see power relations of all types putting some people on the top of the rises preventing people in the dips from getting to the top. Where Friedman sees government intervention in the market as inherently distorting the playing field we liberals see it partially if not totally smoothing it.</p>
<p>Given this the difference between the Republican and Democratic views of the stimulative effects of government spending each are seen to be rational given the very, very large differences in their basic definitions of things like freedom itself. Liberals stamping our feet because there seems to be no real data to support the Treasury View or similar conclusions is pretty much a waste of time because such views pretty much flow right from the foundations of right thought as seen in Friedman&#8217;s work. You are not going to get a meeting of minds when one party singles out Social Security as the poster child of state coercion.<br />
<blockquote>On grounds of principle, this group regarded compulsory federal old age programs as an infringement of their personal individual freedom and refused to pay taxes or accept benefits.</p></blockquote>
<p> as opposed to<br />
<blockquote>The third is freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants &#8212; everywhere in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p>Not only are Friedman and FDR not looking eye to eye here, they are looking in totally different directions using very different lenses.</p>

<p>What do these three things have in common and what possible relevance do they have to the debate over the Stimulus Bill?</p>
<p>The short answer is belief systems. Over at Krugman&#8217;s blog there was a certain amount of baffled debate over issues connected with the Treasury View. From the outside in these views seem to be irrational and counter-factual, people simply don&#8217;t react in the real world in ways that would be necessary. Which leads some of us to wonder if they are lying, ignorant, or insane. And the answer is two-fold and paradoxical-none of the above and all of the above. It is a question of where you stand.</p>
<p>Those interested in some amateur philosophy can follow me below the fold. Warning plenty of pretentious pedantry ahead.<br />St. Anselm of Canterbury, a towering giant in the political, intellectual and theological worlds of the 11th century is known today, if known at all, as one of the earliest proponents of the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument">Ontological Argument for the Existence of God</a>. While the argument itself is interesting (and not so obviously right or obviously wrong as it appears at first glance) I am not so much focusing on it as on the circumstances under which it was formed. Anselm was not a Seeker, not a Doubter and neither was much of his intended audience. His personal belief in the existence of God was unshakeable and not really the product of logic at all and his argument was not intended to proof anything, instead it was a way to further justify belief. That is if you presented him with a line of argumentation to prove that God did not exist he would seek to find the flaw. Similarly if his own argument seemed to fail he would not have changed his belief, instead he would have started his argument over. Because accepting the conclusion would be unthinkable.</p>
<p>Generally most of us have learned to live with people whose religious belief systems are not from the outside totally explicable. Some of the more uncharitable of us mock people of faith, but only a few fanatics seriously try to directly convert them to pure secularism, because secularism is a belief system of its own with its own blind spots. But once we push beyond the realm of religious faith we tend to lose sight that there are all kinds of belief systems out there that bind us in one way or another. We just don&#8217;t see that any given &#8216;counterfactual conclusion&#8217; might really be that the conclusion is just incompatible with your particular belief system. Which doesn&#8217;t make you a liar necessarily, nor does it mean you are ignorant in the sense of unaware of the data in question, nor does it make you crazy in any sense that wouldn&#8217;t apply to any other Believer. But it might make you blind to the fact that your conclusion is ultimately faith based. St. Anselm was a great man in every sense of the word, and a brilliant intellect, but your chances of using any mode of argumentation to prove that God didn&#8217;t exist, or even to cast some doubt on the question to him would have been vanishingly small.</p>
<p>Thomas Kuhn argued in <a target="_blank" href="http://www.des.emory.edu/mfp/kuhnsyn.html">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</a> that most of what we know as science is simply the product of working within a belief system. In fact he calls the work product of this &#8216;Normal Science&#8217;. The above link is to a synopsis of Kuhn by Prof. Frank Pajares who introduces the subject as follows:<br />
<blockquote>A scientific community cannot practice its trade without some set of received beliefs. These beliefs form the foundation of the &#8220;educational initiation that prepares and licenses the student for professional practice&#8221;. The nature of the &#8220;rigorous and rigid&#8221; preparation helps ensure that the received beliefs are firmly fixed in the student&#8217;s mind. Scientists take great pains to defend the assumption that scientists know what the world is like&#8230;To this end, &#8220;normal science&#8221; will often suppress novelties which undermine its foundations. Research is therefore not about discovering the unknown, but rather &#8220;a strenuous and devoted attempt to force nature into the conceptual boxes supplied by professional education&#8221;.</p>
<p>A shift in professional commitments to shared assumptions takes place when an anomaly undermines the basic tenets of the current scientific practice These shifts are what Kuhn describes as scientific revolutions &#8211; &#8220;the tradition-shattering complements to the tradition-bound activity of normal science&#8221; New assumptions –&#8221;paradigms&#8221; &#8211; require the reconstruction of prior assumptions and the re-evaluation of prior facts. This is difficult and time consuming. It is also strongly resisted by the established community.</p></blockquote>
<p> The much abused word &#8216;paradigm&#8217; is roughly equivalent to &#8216;belief system&#8217;. In particular practitioners of Normal Science first and natural reaction to anomalies that don&#8217;t fit into the paradigm is to assume error in data collection or analysis. Only grudgingly will they admit that the paradigm is itself faulty and even then the impulse is not to adandon it but to adjust it. To the outside observer this can end up with results that seem obsessive. Kuhn&#8217;s first major work and the inspiration of &#8216;Scientific Revolutions&#8217; was <a target="_blank" href="http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&#038;id=sWScX_aduGMC&#038;dq=kuhn+copernican+revolution&#038;printsec=frontcover&#038;source=web&#038;ots=WE4zwySwWw&#038;sig=HTrkTb90St-umiC9JuZglv7axWY&#038;ei=eiuPSffdApqWsAODhon3CA&#038;sa=X&#038;oi=book_result&#038;resnum=1&#038;ct=result">Copernican Revolution</a> (a book I have not actually read) was devoted in part to a defense of the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~hos/mike/texts/ptolemy/ptolemy.html">Ptolemaic Astronomers</a>. These people were not simply in denial, they certainly were not ignorant, and not crazy. They were though embedded in a particular belief system in much the same way Anselm was. Heaven like God had to be perfect, Earth had to be at the center of the universe, and the most perfect of all shapes is the circle. That the resulting system was to the modern observer fantastically convoluted to the believer is a feature and not a bug. Medieval Astronomy like Medieval Theology like Talmudic Scholarship was extraordinarily complicated, but for believers that complexity was just a feature, nobody ever promised anybody that Truth comes in easy packages.</p>
<p>Which finally gets us back to Libertarianism and Classical Liberal Economics. To the extent you can distinguish between the two the practitioners tend to insist that they are just engaging in rational scientific practice. Some of them push this idea to the extreme, for people like Prof. Bryan Caplan rejecting his conclusions make you by definition irrational. For example take two short passages from his <a target="_blank" href="http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/autobio.htm">Intellectual Autobiography</a><br />
<blockquote>Matt read Atlas Shrugged.  One day he turned around in his chair and told me “Read this part.  You’ll like it.”  It was Francisco d’Anconia’s speech on money, and I rushed through it in fifteen exciting minutes.  But for unclear reasons, I didn’t begin reading Atlas until the last week of summer before my senior year.  If memory serves me, I raced through its thousand-plus pages in three largely sleepless days.</p>
<p>I would not call myself an instant convert.  But I did start what I call “trying on her ideas for size.”  When opportunity presented itself &#8211; or when I cornered my parents or friends or teachers or random fellow students &#8211; I played devil’s advocate for Rand’s Objectivism.   After a couple of months &#8211; a long time in the intellectual life of a teen-ager &#8211; I was not playing devil’s advocate any longer.  I was convinced that her philosophy was by and large correct.</p></blockquote>
<p>and<br />
<blockquote>As I digested the stock of libertarian insight, I noticed a phenomenon central to my mature research: Most people violently rejected even my most truistic arguments.  Yes, I was a shrill teen-ager, but it seems like anyone should have recognized the potential downside of drug regulation once I pointed it out.  Instead, they yelled louder about Thalidomide babies.  True, it was not a complete surprise &#8211; I had already experienced the futility of trying to convert my family and friends to atheism during the prior year.  But I was frustrated to find that human beings were almost as dogmatic about politics and economics as they were about religion and philosophy.</p></blockquote>
<p>There are words for people who believe that Faith precedes Reason, that using the latter to justify the former is just the normal course of logical and even scientific thinking. Some of those words are pretty unkind, when I read libertarians my first judgment is &#8216;crazy as a bedbug&#8217;. But I am willing to give St. Anselm and the Ptolemaic Astronomers a pass, they were simply engaged in the Normal Science of their day. </p>
<p>St. Anselm would have been happy to admit he was hemmed in by the limits of his belief systems. Certain things had been established by the Early Doctors of the Church at the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dailycatholic.org/history/councils.htm">eight Great Ecumenical Councils</a> and going outside those limits was heretical and at times and places subject to punishment by being burned alive. What fundamentally distinguishes people of openly religious faith and believers in Economics as Science is that most of the latter simply refuse to acknowledge that they have converted to a particular belief system and so are constrained by it. This is something they share with most Normal Scientists who tend still to reject Kuhn&#8217;s sociological analysis really on the basis that it challenges the very basis of their (to them) invisible belief system.</p>
<p>So yes Economics is scientific, just as Medieval Scholasticism was scientific, and as Ptolemaic Astronomy was scientific. None of which makes its conclusions true for all time. Einstein went to his death bed still struggling with the implications of Quantum Mechanics. He simply wouldn&#8217;t believe that in the end much of the Universe could only be explained by God Playing Dice.</p>
<p>I am not at all claiming that the Republican Senators and their enablers are Saints, or Scholars. And God knows none of them are Einstein. I am just saying that you have to understand that like the medieval scholars they are trapped within a fundamentally faith based model that insists that Markets are Perfect. If they have to insert a few epicycles into their theory (or in this case accept the Treasury View) to make it work well that is just the way it is. Nobody said Faith was supposed to be Easy.</p>

<p>Nice to see that no Republican, and precious few Democratic Senators, believe in following even Andrew Samwick&#8217;s <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/761/haste-makes-waste">tepid endorsement</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Congress and the Obama Administration should be very discriminating in what they will spend money on.  Bailout money for banks and large firms should go.  Every piece of pork in the stimulus bill should go.  Every additional tax cut should go.  What should remain are the highest value public infrastructure projects, many of which the government has been deferring for years or decades.</p></blockquote>
<p>which is a minor modification of <a href="http://capitalgainsandgames.com/blog/andrew-samwick/749/more-stimulus-silliness">his previous position</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[A]s I will continue to blog until I am blue in the fingers, the appropriate course of action when the economic downturn appears like it will be unusually severe is to bring planned capital projects forward in time.  Doing so allows them to be done more cheaply. </p></blockquote>
<p>This would be especially true of the non-&#8220;highest value&#8221; projects, as an Finance person can tell you. (At 2%, it might have a positive NPV; at 5% and full employment, it will, er, &#8220;crowd out.&#8221;)</p>

In the meanwhile here is the list.<br />First we can put paid to the idea that this was just a social program pork-fest designed to advance the liberal agenda. Unless of course you include law enforcement, homeland security, science and broadband as being exclusively liberal concerns. Because all of them got hit pretty hard here. But there is no doubt who took it in the shorts overall-schools. $16.5 billion in schools, another $3.5 billion in higher education construction, whatever portion of the $40 billion in state funds that would have gone to schools, and $600 million for No Child Left Behind. And at least half of that school funding devoted directly to construction, which is to say local jobs. Plus we could add in the $1 billion dollar cut in Head Start funding.</p>
<p>Second what is really striking is that the list is really not very ideological at all. It looks pretty much like what it is, demands by deficit hawks to trim back the overall cost. Moreover most of the line items look like they would survive the normal appropriations process. That is once Republicans realize they have failed in their attempt to derail the entire bill in the name of tax cuts they are unlikely to run around and oppose more narrow packages. That is I can see a Law Enforcement bill emerging, from this, and a Science bill, and a Homeland Security bill all that could draw bi-partisan support as stand-alone legislation. An Education package might be harder lifting, but you can count on Republican governors leaning heavily on their senators.</p>
<p>All in all a reasonable approach.</p>

                                <p>What is infrastructure?</p>
<p>Some people seem to have a working definition that limits to highways and bridges. Others would expand it to include anything built of concrete and steel. Well that is a little too narrow a view. Instead we should include pretty much all public capital goods in that definition. So in addition to highways and bridges we would add railways and rail cars, earthen dams and levees, federal buildings and schools, power and communication towers and lines, in short anything whose utility is measured in decades rather than just a few years. And I would include in that repairs and rehabilitation that extend the useable life of existing capital goods. If we go through the stimulus package with that definition in mind how much infrastructure is actually being created?</p>
<p>But before answering that we need to figure out our baseline. Up to now I have generally been scoring programs as a percentage of the overall bill. But in fact the bill breaks out into three pieces: Division A Appropriations, Division B Direct Spending, and Division B Tax Effects.<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYsfD2pVE9I/AAAAAAAAAGY/j6ygmqtigOI/s1600-h/CBO_Senate_Estimate.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYsfD2pVE9I/AAAAAAAAAGY/j6ygmqtigOI/s400/CBO_Senate_Estimate.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Relatively few critics of the bill are singling out Div B spending and many of them support expanding Div B tax cuts so really all of the focus of the budget hawks is on Div A. So when we single out a certain line item for better or worse we are talking about some percentage of $365 billion. With that in mind I all going to start splitting out the spending by title below the fold. I won&#8217;t get to everything today. Consider this a work in process. (And please feel free to double check my work. I am just going by the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9977/hr1senate.pdf">CBO Estimates</a> which are not in full detail. Detailed numbers would be found in the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.finance.senate.gov/sitepages/leg/LEG%202009/020209%20complete%20legislative%20text%20of%20American%20Recovery%20and%20Reinvestment%20Act.pdf">Senate Bill</a> )</p>
<p>Title 1 $21.6 billion Agriculture, Rural Development $3.8 billion<br />Title 2 $21 billion Commerce, Justice, Science $9 billion<br />Title 3 $3.7 billion Defense    $3.4 billion<br />Title 4 $53.8 billion Energy and Water $35.4 billion (minimum)<br />Title 5 $10.7 billion Financial Services and Government $9 billion<br />Title 6 $5.1 billion Homeland Security (will need to take a look at the bill language, but about a fourth for construction at border crossings, most of the rest for detection equipment)<br />Title 7 $11.6 billion Interior and Environment $10+ billion<br />Title 8 $89.3 billion Labor, HHS, Education $20+ billion<br />Title 9 $20 million Legislative Branch $0<br />Title 10 $7.4 billion Military and Veterans $6.7 billion<br />Title 11 $1 billion State Department $1 billion<br />Title 12 $60.6 billion Transportation and HUD $45 billion<br />Title 13 $79 billion State Stabilization ($??-states will decide)<br />Total ~$145 billion out of $365 billion is clearly slated for Infrastructure as defined. A detailed scrubbing of the bill would likely turn up some more. And if we broke out direct job programs (Census, firefighters) and added in dollars for research, particularly for energy efficiency it would total much more.</p>

                                <p>I&#8217;ve said before that the &#8220;Buy American&#8221; provisions in the stimulus bill were not exactly a major issue. (I believe the phrase was roughly, &#8220;could drive a broken Mexican truck through the holes, even if dead drunk.&#8221;)  Many economists (hi, <a target="_blank" href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2009/02/revoke-krugmans-nobel-prize.html">Barkley</a>) disagreed, even while some acknowledged that the income effect from &#8220;buying American&#8221; would be <a href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2009/01/buy-domestic-policies-are-individually-irrational-too.html">mitigated by the substitution effect on the FX rate</a>, while others noted that reprisal threats <a target="_blank" href="http://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2009/02/only-idiots-start-wars-they-cant-win.html">just might not be credible</a>.</p>
<p>But time went by, and Barry O. &#8220;yielded,&#8221; adding an explicit provision that &#8220;buy American&#8221; would <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/02/the-senate-and-buy-america.html">follow current trade agreements</a>—which the more aware economists later noted was basically an indication that <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/02/ah-the-weaker-version-of-buy-america-is-not-quite-toothless-after-all.html">we will support &#8220;free trade&#8221; only if the other guy does</a>.

<p>So now is the time for credit-taking.  And while <a href="http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/582767">the usual suspects</a> want to be credited, the reality of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.progressive-economics.ca/2009/02/05/who-saved-canadian-steel/">what they asked for and what they received</a> belies that claim.</p>
<p>Who came to the support of &#8220;free trade for free traders&#8221;?  Why, <a href="http://news.sympatico.msn.cbc.ca/World/ContentPosting?newsitemid=17821019&#038;feedname=CP-WORLD&#038;show=False&#038;number=0&#038;showbyline=True&#038;subtitle=&#038;detect=&#038;abc=abc&#038;date=True">the United Steelworkers Union, of course</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The news came only hours after the United Steelworkers pleaded Canada&#8217;s case to lawmakers from steel-producing states.</p>
<p>A written submission to the congressional steel committee from the Steelworkers&#8217; president, Canadian Leo Gerard, asked that legislators exempt Canada from the provision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Because we are an international union, and because Canadian and U.S. manufacturing is so integrated, we encourage you and other members of the steel caucus to approach your counterparts in Canada to discuss a co-ordinated approach,&#8221; Gerard&#8217;s submission read&#8230;.</p>
<p>The Steelworkers have said it&#8217;s Chinese steel, not Canadian, that&#8217;s the intended target of &#8220;Buy American.&#8221; American steel-makers have long accused China of employing unjust policies that give its steel manufacturers a competitive advantage.</p></blockquote>
<p>Anyone wonder <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/steel-made-in-america-or-made-in-china.html">why they might believe that</a>?</p>
<p>And, needless to say, <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/op-ed-misplaced-handwringing-on.html">EconomistMom&#8217;s organization</a> is right in the middle of the fooforaw:<br />
<blockquote>The steel company executives who showed up for Wednesday&#8217;s caucus hearing were skeptical of the &#8220;Buy American&#8221; warnings.</p>
<p>Dan DiMicco, chief executive of Nucor Corp., dismissed as &#8220;garbage&#8221; a recent study by the Peterson Institute for International Economics that &#8220;Buy American&#8221; could cost, not save, thousands of U.S. jobs.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American people are with us and with you on this issue,&#8221; he told the steel caucus members.</p></blockquote>
<p>And they&#8217;re right.  The American people support free trade—with countries that allow us free trade.</p>
<p>It seems that only some economists cannot tell the difference.</p>

                                <p>Up to now most of the numbers used in the Pick your Pork series have been drawn from the initial House version of the bill. But now the action has moved to the Senate and it is time to shift our ground in response. So lets develop some links.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=205">CBO Director&#8217;s Blog: Macroeconomic Effects of the Senate Stimulus Legislation</a><br />
<blockquote>CBO estimates that the Senate legislation would raise output by between 1.4 percent and 4.1 percent by the fourth quarter of 2009; by between 1.2 percent and 3.6 percent by the fourth quarter of 2010; and by between 0.4 percent and 1.2 percent by the fourth quarter of 2011. CBO estimates that the legislation would raise employment by 0.9 million to 2.5 million at the end of 2009; 1.3 million to 3.9 million at the end of 2010; and 0.6 million to 1.9 million at the end of 2011.</p></blockquote>
<p><a target="_blank" href="http://cboblog.cbo.gov/?p=204">CBO Cost Estimate: Summary</a><br />
<blockquote>CBO estimates that if enacted in mid-February, H.R. 1 as amended would increase outlays by $132 billion during the remaining several months of fiscal year 2009, by $242 billion in fiscal year 2010, by $145 billion in 2011, and by a total of $632 billion over the 2009-2019 period. In addition, CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that enacting the proposed Senate amendment to H.R. 1 would reduce revenues by $101 billion in fiscal year 2009, by $219 billion in fiscal year 2010, and by a net amount of $253 billion over the 2009-2019 period. (Approximately $96 billion of the estimated revenue change is attributable to the proposed tax credit for wage earners and $70 billion to the proposed changes in the AMT.)</p>
<p>Combining those effects, CBO estimates that enacting the Senate amendment would increase federal budget deficits by $233 billion over the remaining months of fiscal year 2009, by $461 billion in 2010, by $142 billion in 2011, and by about $884 billion over over the 2009-2019 period.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the meanwhile: Pick your Pork!</p>
<p>(Update. Though it should be clear enough from the formatting none of these numbers are mine. The text in blockquotes has just been cut and pasted right from the original CBO documents.)</p>

                                <p>Well not really, they just repeat some talking points without giving numbers. (via Dean Baker) <a target="_blank" href="http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/editorials/stories/2009/02/03/badstim.ART_ART_02-03-09_A8_VPCP5R0.html?sid=101">Stimulus plan should focus on private-sector jobs, not increased social spending</a><br />
<blockquote>Also, the $300 billion targeted for social programs, many of them Democratic favorites, would not generate much immediate economic activity. Improving teacher quality, providing additional cash for Head Start and promoting wellness, for example, are standard government social-spending items that have little to do with stimulating instantaneous economic activity. Democrats are simply expanding spending on their traditional priorities under the cover of an economic emergency.</p>
<p>In fact, only about 5 percent of the plan&#8217;s spending is aimed at the immediate creation of jobs through infrastructure projects, such as repair and construction of roads and bridges. But if the goal is to blunt a wave of job losses as Obama has said, this is where the money should be spent. It also is the only kind of spending that represents a lasting investment, one that will benefit the future taxpayers who will be footing the bill for this borrowed spending.</p></blockquote>
<p> Well I got to call bullshit on this. Unless someone out there can actually present a list of spending that supports either number. 5% of the bill adds up to about $45 billion. Is that really all that is being spent on job creation? Maybe if you limit your definition to roads and bridges. But buildings have lasting utility and create jobs. And some services have lasting utilities and researchers and teachers fill jobs. But even absent that is there really $300 billion in social programs in this bill? Well lets see. Using real numbers.</p>
<p>Under the House Bill spending is divided into Division A which are basically contracts and Division B which is direct government spending. Looking from the top down how does that break out? In the following I will give the total for the category (plus obvious social spending).</p>
<p>Division A<br />Title 1 $248 million General Provisions <br />Title 2 $27 billion Agriculture, Nutrition, Rural Development ($20 billion Supplemental Nutrition Assistance)<br />Title 3 $14 billion Commerce, Science, Justice<br />Title 4 $4.8 billion Defense <br />Title 5 $49 billion Energy and Water<br />Title 6 $8.5 billion Financial Services and Federal Building<br />Title 7 $1.1 billion Homeland Security<br />Title 8 $14.5 billion Interior and Environment<br />Title 9 $91 billion Labor and Education ($71 billion excluding school construction)<br />Title 10 $7 billion Military Construction and Veterans Affairs<br />Title 11 $500 million State Department<br />Title 12 $59 billion Transportation and HUD ($11 billion Housing Assistance, $5 billion  Community Development)<br />Title 13 $39 billion State Fiscal Stabilization (???)<br />Total $358 billion.</p>
<p>First we are not really getting very far towards that $300 billion in social spending. And that figure of $45 billion for infrastructure is clearly bogus unless you simply limit your focus to Title 12 and ignore all spending on government buildings, schools, energy (including the smart grid), water projects (because levees and dams are infrastructure) and broadband build out.</p>
<p>Division B<br />Title 1 $79 billion Tax Provisions<br />Title 2 $45.6 billion Unemployment and Struggling families ($45.6 billion)<br />Title 3 $13 billion Health Insurance for the Unemployed ($13 billion)<br />Title 4 $20 billion Health Information Technology (???)<br />Title 5 $89 billion Medicaid ($89 billion)<br />Total $248 billion</p>
<p>So we can see at least $218 billion in what could immediately be labeled Social Programs. But that includes $20 billion in food stamps, $58 billion in spending on the unemployed, and $89 billion on medicare. Now maybe some of that can be pared back but I don&#8217;t know of anyone who seriously says we should let the jobless and working poor just starve or go without access to medical care. Plus a lot of the Title 12 spending on Housing Assistance and Community Development ends up funding infrastructure. Making the following kind of heartless &#8220;$300 billion targeted for social programs, many of them Democratic favorites, would not generate much immediate economic activity&#8221; as well as being economic nonsense. Huge percentages of that total (however derived) are directly injected into the economy in purchases of food, household essentials, utility payments and rent. The only pool of money that remotely meets the description of Democratic favored social programs (as opposed to not letting people starve, which ideally is not a partisan issue) is the money in Title 9 Labor and Education. Which I will break out under the fold.</p>
<blockquote><p>Improving teacher quality, providing additional cash for Head Start and promoting wellness, for example, are standard government social-spending items that have little to do with stimulating instantaneous economic activity. Democrats are simply expanding spending on their traditional priorities under the cover of an economic emergency.</p></blockquote>
<p> Quite apart from the ridiculous implication that these items even remotely start adding up to $300 billion, the premise is not very sound to start with. I believe it was Ken who linked to a study showing the direct economic benefits from Head Start. But in any event what are the dollars involved.</p>
<p>Title 9 breaks down into the following categories:<br />$20 billion Health and Human Services<br />$4.6 billion Employment and Training Administration<br />$20 billion School Modernization and Repair <br />$17 billion Student Aid<br />$30 billion Other Education<br />$600 million Other Title 9</p>
<p>Given that no one seriously is proposing eliminating student loans and that School Modernization is both infrastructure and would stimulate economic activity (if not instantaneously, someone is smoking tax cut weed) we seem to be left with some $50 billion that potentially fits the Dispatches description. So lets take it down a level.</p>
<p>Subtitle A Labor<br />$500 million State grants for training and employment programs<br />$1.2 billion State grants for youth job programs and other activities (youth defined as 24 or younger)<br />$1 billion State Grants for training dislocated workers<br />$500 million national dislocated worker reserve fund<br />$50 million YouthBuild program<br />$750 million Training and placement in high tech and emerging industry sectors<br />$120 million Community Service Employment for Older Americans<br />$500 million State unemployment administration<br />$80 million Administration<br />$300 million Job Corps</p>
<p>Subtitle B Health and Human Services<br />$500 million Grants to Health Centers<br />$1 billion Renovation and Repair of Health Centers<br />$88 million Equipping new headquarters of the Public Health Service<br />$600 million Training nurses, doctors and dentists<br />$462 million Center for Disease Control for equipment, construction and renovation<br />$1.5 billion National Center for Research Resources for renovation and repair of non-Federal Research facilities<br />$1.5 billion Office of the Director for research grants<br />$600 million NIH buildings and facilities<br />$700 million Comparative effectiveness research<br />$1 billion Low Income Home Energy Assistance (1981 Act)<br />$2 billion Child Care block grants to States<br />$1 billion Head Start<br />$1.1 billion expansion of Early Head Start<br />$1 billion Community Services Block Grants<br />$100 million Faith Based and Community Groups<br />$200 million Aging Services (1965 Act)<br />$2 billion Information Technology<br />$900 million Public Health and Social Services Emergencies Fund<br />$3 billion Prevention and Wellness Fund<br />But lets see how this breaks down: $2.35 billion to the Center for Disease Control including $954 million for immunization and $554 million for chronic disease, health promotion and genomics programs</p>
<p>Subtitle C Education<br />$13 billion Education for the Disadvantaged (pursuant to the ESEA Act of 1965)<br />$100 million Impact Aid (offsets the impact of local military bases not paying property tax)<br />$1 billion School Improvement (this relates to a Homeless act, how exactly I don&#8217;t know)<br />$225 million Innovation and Improvement<br />$13.6 billion Special Education<br />$700 million Rehabilitation and Disability Research (getting the disabled into the work force)<br />$16 billion Student Aid for College Students (Pell grants)<br />$50 million Student Aid Administration<br />$100 million Higher Education<br />$250 million Education Technical Assistance Act (statewide data systems)</p>
<p>Where the hell is the wishlist here? This is overwhelmingly continuing funding for existing programs. I don&#8217;t even see an obvious place for the Dispatch&#8217;s &#8220;improving teacher quality&#8221;, maybe it is somewhere in that rather mysterious $1 bn for &#8216;school improvement&#8217;. As for Head Start we are talking $2.1 billion or about .25% of the bill. And &#8220;wellness&#8221; seems to be just tucked in with the wider program to tackle chronic diseases.</p>
<p>Once again we can see that these anti-stimulus people are not even cherry-picking, instead they are digging deep into the bill to pick nits. The categories of spending the Dispatch editorial writer is point out as support for his advice to &#8220;Start over&#8221; represent less than 1% of the total package. (And BTW the guy swallows the Fama argument whole). Each and everytime some one expresses outrage over some line item &#8220;tax breaks for Hollywood!&#8221; or &#8220;teacher quality&#8221; to try to make people think the whole bill is just payback to campaign supporters. Instead the argument is just bogosity, bluster and bullshit meant as a stalking horse for tax cuts (which is what he means when he says &#8220;private-sector jobs&#8221;).</p>
<p>This is just not an economic argument. And sorry I still can&#8217;t taste the liverwurst.</p>

                                <p>Well the gloves came off this morning. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/02/gop.stimulus.worries/index.html">What GOP Leaders deem wasteful in Senate stimulus bill</a><br />
<blockquote>STORY HIGHLIGHTS<br />House Republicans unveil list of &#8220;wasteful&#8221; Senate stimulus spending<br />Stimulus bill passed in the House without any Republican support<br />One provision: A $246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers<br />Another concern: $75 million for salaries of employees at the FBI</p></blockquote>
<p>I have listed all the line items below the fold divided into five categories. 1)  &#8216;Spending that could use some explanation&#8217; This includes that Hollywood tax break (hint the four words left out of Highlights make a difference) 2) Equipment purchases 3) Building and Infrastructure 4) Public Health 5) Jobs.</p>
<p>Let us set some parameters. There is a distinction between &#8216;wasteful&#8217;  and &#8216;inefficient&#8217;. That is there is spending that may not meet somebody&#8217;s policy preferences (wasteful)  but still has stimulative effects over the short term. And then there is spending that everyone agrees would be useful but which doesn&#8217;t go into effect fast enough. If you look at the Republican list as it shows in the original story these two categories are blurred and blended with no real explanations as to which they consider which.</p>
<p>Jobs. $3.185 billion If the major challenge facing us short term is unemployment then direct spending on jobs is a pretty efficient way to inject money into the system. And certainly better than just extending unemployment insurance (though we need to do some of that too). Which makes Republican opposition on this front a little odd to start with, particularly when we examine the first three line items. $1 billion for the Census. Well this is one of the very few specific Constitutional mandates, we have to do it good times or bad, as it happens we will be needing census workers right at the point we are projecting our greatest rate of unemployment. Exactly how does this fall in the category of &#8216;wasteful&#8217;? Particularly since there is a $3 billion gap between authorization and projected costs? I don&#8217;t get it. $75 million for FBI salaries. We got news stories last week showing that the FBI was aware of major mortgage fraud but had diverted existing resources to counterterror duties. Unless you believe that Wall Street reformed itself overnight it is hard to see why this is in any sense &#8216;wasteful&#8217;. Not only do we need the Agents this translates directly to jobs. $650 million for wildfire management. Translation: fire crews. In recent years for whatever reason the fire season has been getting longer and more destructive and the Forest Service has consistently blown through its fire fighting budget requiring diversions from other programs. Plus these are great opportunities to get young workers into the work force in jobs that allow on the job training. Economic efficiency and public safety combined, yet it made the list. The other three line items which total $1.46 billion merit some discussion but all translate directly into jobs that offer on the job training and which also can be put in place quickly. The GOP seems to be straining here.</p>
<p>Public Health $500 million dollars. Prevention of STDs $400 million. Prevention of any infectious disease translates to productivity improvements. The apparent basis for including this on the list is that the GOP would rather have people get sick than let women have access to reproductive controls. It is all about the condoms. The remaining $100 million is for smoking cessation and tribal alcohol abuse. You can make the economic argument for either but really this is a joke. We are talking about .012% of the package here. It just seems that the GOP hates spending any tax money on public goods.</p>
<p>Building and infrastructure. At $10.6 billion by far the largest category. And while you can argue the merits of spending $6 billion upgrading Federal buildings to make them more &#8220;green&#8221; (which sounds more wasteful than calling it what it is &#8220;more energy efficient&#8221;) all of these projects translate directly into jobs. It is just hard to see the economic argument at work here. Plus you have to have a heart as hard as a stone to reach way down into the package to highlight $5.5 million in spending at the VA National Cemetary Administration. That is .0006% of the total. (And yes the money is probably going to be spent at headquarters, but still the symbolism stinks).</p>
<p>Equipment. $1.8 billion. Maybe the Coast Guard doesn&#8217;t need a new icebreaker. On the other hand polar nations are in a scramble to establish claims to newly reachable gas and oil resources on the Arctic Sea floor. $88 million doesn&#8217;t seem like a lot to spend to beef up our arctic presence. I have no idea why this made the cut. But the rest is pretty explicable. The Republicans have always hated Amtrak ($850 million) and typically poo-poo &#8220;green&#8221; anything including alternative energy vehicles ($800 million). But it is hard to see the economic argument against any of this.</p>
<p>Which leaves us with $2.9 billion in what reasonably could be seen as pork. $2 billion for a clean coal plant defunded last year on grounds of &#8220;inefficiency&#8221;. Maybe Dr. Chu has some ideas about how to correct the problem but it doesn&#8217;t look good on the surface. $650 million on TV convertor boxes. Well there is a public policy case to be made here, but considering the units are probably made in Malaysia or China, the economic case seems shakier. And that tax break for Hollywood producers. Like those guys need more money. On the other hand the actual tax break is for buying motion picture film. So maybe there is an economic case to be made that this creates jobs. On the Left Coast. So it is easy to see why this made the cut. But $2.9 billion is only about .4% of the whole package.</p>
<p>In fact if we add it all together (which the original article doesn&#8217;t) we are a shade under $19 billion or 2.15%. Sorry this is not an economic argument for waste or inefficiency, they simply threw everything they could into the mix and created a laundry list to give some cover to their real agenda. Which is as it has always been-tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>
