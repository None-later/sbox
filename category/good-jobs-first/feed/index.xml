				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>According to Center on Budget and Policy Priority data cited by <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/us/how-local-taxpayers-bankroll-corporations.html?ref=louisestory&#038;_r=0">Louise Story</a>,  in 2011 the states enacted $156 billion of austerity measures, between  budget cuts and tax hikes. Despite their budgetary woes, however, this  did not stop them from throwing billions of dollars a year into the  worst kind of corporate subsidy, relocation incentives that move  existing facilities from one state to another without creating any new  jobs. A <a href="http://www.goodjobsfirst.org/sites/default/files/docs/pdf/shellgame.pdf">new report</a> from Good Jobs First documents their widespread use, which is <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2012/02/bad-trends-in-economic-development-weak.html">far more common</a> than most people would imagine.</p>
<p>One great aspect of this report is that it goes beyond the two examples of <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-good-jobs-first-study-shows-micro.html">interstate border wars</a> we hear the most about, New York-New Jersey-Connecticut and  Kansas-Missouri. We learn about Texas and Georgia vs. the world, North  Carolina-South Carolina (especially in the Charlotte metro area),  Tennessee-Mississippi (particularly with Memphis as target), and Rhode  Island-Massachusetts. In addition, we learn more about the flip side of  job piracy, retention subsidies, of which <a href="http://clawback.org/2012/02/20/sears-now-come-the-penalty-free-headquarters-layoffs/">Sears&#8217; two in Illinois</a> are the most egregious.</p>
<p>For  example, Continental Tire moved its North American headquarters and 320  jobs from Charlotte to Lancaster County, South Carolina, in 2009.  Georgia gave Ohio-based NCR Corp. (formerly National Cash Register) $109  million to relocate that same year. In 2010, Hamilton Beach received at  least $2 million to move from Memphis to Olive Branch, Mississippi,  while in 2009 McKesson received $4 million from Mississippi in addition  to local incentives to move from Memphis to neighboring DeSoto County.  Rhode Island, in a widely publicized move, gave Boston Red Sox pitcher  Curt Schilling&#8217;s video game company 38 Studios a $75 million loan to  move from Massachusetts in 2009, only to see theÂ  firm go bankrupt in  2012. There are many more examples in the report, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>The  existence of relocation subsidies makes it possible for companies to  demand incentives to stay in a particular state, i.e., retention  subsidies. Two of the three largest ones went to Sears in Illinois, $168  million in 1989 and another $275 million in 2012 when the 1989 deal  expired. The second largest was $250 million to Prudential Insurance  from New Jersey in 2011. But many more states have had to shell out  retention subsidies on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The report  notes that at least 40 states know how to write no-raiding language into  their subsidy programs, because they already have such language banning  intra-state relocations from receiving subsidies under various  programs. However, as far as I know, far fewer states prevent their  cities from giving relocation subsidies to in-state firms, though the  report shows that Maine&#8217;s Employment Tax Increment Financing rules do  provide that.</p>
<p>What is necessary, the report argues and I  wholeheartedly agree, is that states need to tweak their program  language to stop rewarding interstate job relocation as well. They need  to stop efforts to directly poach existing firms, something Texas is  heavily engaged in. The report says there is a &#8220;possible&#8221; federal role  here, to withhold some Department of Commerce monies from states that  engaged in job piracy. I, on the other hand, think that federal action  is the only way it will happen. As I&#8217;ve <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/07/new-good-jobs-first-study-shows-micro.html">written before</a>,  voluntary state efforts in the 1980s and 1990s to end job piracy have  been utter failures, and the states clearly need an outside enforcement  mechanism, which can only be provided by the federal government.</p>
<p>With  such extensive documentation of how widespread relocation and retention  subsidies are, hopefully more people can be mobilized to get the  federal action we need.</p>
