<blockquote>the Dread Evil Neoliberal School Reformer Barack Obama And His Lackeys At The Center For American Progress </p></blockquote>
<p>Yep, Matt has been <a href="http://jerseyjazzman.blogspot.com/2011/08/good-intentions.html">doing</a> <a href="http://jerseyjazzman.blogspot.com/2010/10/part-ii-what-helsinki.html">great</a> <a href="http://jerseyjazzman.blogspot.com/2011/08/follow-money.html">things</a> for <a href="http://jerseyjazzman.blogspot.com/2011/08/when-liberal-elites-do-education-reform.html">education</a>.</p>

<p>As for Barack &#8220;Also Never Attended a Public School, But I Know All About Them&#8221; Obama, all that needs to be said was said by <a href="http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/beat-the-press/thomas-friedman-bard-of-the-1-percent-reports-on-the-problem-of-incompetent-ceos">Dean Baker on Saturday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Emanuel&#8217;s predecessor as mayor, Richard Daley, also placed an emphasis on reforming Chicago&#8217;s schools. From 2001 to 2009 he installed Arne Duncan, <strong>currently President Obama&#8217;s Secretary of Education</strong>, as head of the Chicago school system. If Friedman and Emanuel&#8217;s complaints about the current state of Chicago&#8217;s schools are accurate, this would imply that Duncan must not have been very successful in his tenure even though he was widely acclaimed as a reformer at the time.</p></blockquote>
