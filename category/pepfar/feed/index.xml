				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Several recent events have been described as &#8220;just symbolism,&#8221; which apparently is a method of dismissing uncomfortable statements of fact, such as &#8216;Sarah Palin is the nominee for Vice President&#8217; or &#8216;Rick Warren will give the invocation at Barack Obama&#8217;s inauguration.&#8217; Apparently, these moments are supposed to have a lifespan closer to that of Britney Spears&#8217;s first marriage than, say, <a target="_blank" href="http://britneyspears.ac/lasers.htm">Britney Spears&#8217; [sic] Guide to Semiconductor Physics</a>.*</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0106/p25s04-wome.html">Symbolism Writ Large</a>, in a manner to shame <a target="_blank" href="http://www.christojeanneclaude.net/">Christo</a> himself:<br />
<blockquote>US opens world&#8217;s largest foreign mission in Iraq</p>
<p>The $592 million, 104-acre compound that was dedicated in Baghdad&#8217;s fortified Green Zone on Monday is meant to symbolize a long-term commitment to Iraq. </p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot of &#8220;symbolizing.&#8221;  </p>
<p>Tell me again why we need to be cautious in investing in domestic infrastructure. (Yes, I get that it&#8217;s <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/infrastructure-stimulus-amounts.html">incrementally larger</a>. So was the <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Aid_Highway_Act_of_1956">Federal-Aid Highway Transportation Act of 1956</a>. Nu?)</p>
<p>*Since Rick Warren was the driving force behind the PEPFAR initiative, discussed by cactus <a target="_blank" href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/12/bush-as-great-man-new-meme.html">here</a>, response for <a target="_blank" href="http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oew-clement21feb21,0,3690830.story">tens of thousands of African illnesses and deaths</a>, and so discredited that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/1201/p04s01-woaf.html">even popular television shows</a> are lambasting it, the idea that he will Just Go Away on 20 January 2009 around 2:00pm is even more absurd than usual.</p>
