<p>So I&#8217;ve been thinking: What, since the passage of Medicare has the federal government implemented that actually reduced  the risk of living for the US citizen?</p>
<p>No, tax cuts do not count.  They do not reduce risk.  We have reduced risk for business all over the place.  NAFTA, CAFTA, exemption of HMO&#8217;s from anti-trust, removal of banking regulation, reduction of oversight, allowing payment in the form of stock options, all of these promoted ever larger and thus less competition and thus less risk.  All of them allowed a bigger piece of the income pie, thus reduced risk by increasing income.  Tax reductions do not increase income, just decrease expense and ultimately reduce services that people relied on to reduce the risk of living in the US.  We protected Harley Davidson, we financially backed bad business results.  We reduced the 5 mph bumper to 2.5 for the auto industry.   None of this has reduced the risk of living, and have actually increased the risk of living in the US.  </p>
<p>Katrina?  Lead paint in Asian products, contaminated food.  Cut&#8217;s in education, medical, civil services, infrastructure failure.  Privatization <strong>may</strong> have reduced some costs, deregulation <strong>may</strong> have decreased some costs (the supposed Walmart benefit), but all of it shifted cost to the individual removing it from the collective.  It has resulted in a greater risk of financial ruin in an environment that has decreased the share of income to the 99%.   Not having a corresponding rise in income with a rise in productivity only served to increase risk to US. </p>
<p>I want to know of a piece of legislation that actually removed or significantly reduced the risk of living life in the US such that the US citizen was that much closer to succeeding in their pursuit of happiness.  I&#8217;m not interested in some little piece for a sector of the citizenry.  I want to know if anyone can name a piece of legislation such as Social Security, 40 hr work week, Civil Rights, Medicare that has passed since Medicare that actually reduce risk for US such that We the People felt that much more secure in our individual lives in that fear has been reduced.</p>

<p>Come on, step right up, don&#8217;t be afraid.  Lay that money down.  </p>
<p><a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/banking-budgeting/article/107512/economists-call-for-bernanke-to-stay-say-recession-is-over.html?sec=topStories&#038;pos=8&#038;asset=&#038;ccode="><br />3 and 1/8 economist out of 4 say </a>the dastardly deed is done or ending by next month.  </p>
<blockquote><p>After months of uncertainty, economists are finally seeing a break in the clouds. Forecasts were revised upward for every period, with 27 economists saying the recession had ended and 11 seeing a trough this month or next.&#8221;</p>
<p>A better-than-expected employment report for July, where employers cut 247,000 jobs and the jobless rate fell for the first time in 15 months, suggests the worst is over.<br />Whatever the Fed decides, the economists expressed some confidence that the central bank will be dealing with how to manage a recovery, not another recession. They expect GDP growth to remain above 2% at an annualized rate through the first half of next year, and they put the chances at just 20% of a &#8220;double-dip&#8221; second downturn before 2010.</p></blockquote>

<p>All in everyone, you don&#8217;t want to be left out of the next bubble do you?  Or do you?<br />
<blockquote>4) To be sure, <a href="http://blogs.reuters.com/james-pethokoukis/2009/08/08/4-reasons-why-the-july-unemployment-report-was-worse-than-you-think/">the drop in the unemployment rate </a>was a surprise, but it was all due to the slide in the labour force — the employment-to-population ratio gives a more accurate picture of the slack in the labour market and the hidden secret in today’s report was that <strong>this metric slid to a 25-year low of 59.4% from 59.5% in June and 61.0% at the turn of the year.</strong> Of those unemployed, 33.8% of them have been unemployed now for over 27 weeks — a record amount (was at 29.0% in June and was at 17.5% at the start of this recession).</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>The <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32374533/ns/business-eye_on_the_economy">Labor Department said Tuesday </a>that the American work force <strong>produced, at an annual rate, 6.4 percent more </strong>of the goods they made and services they provided in the second quarter of this year compared to a year ago. At the same time, <strong>“unit labor costs”</strong> — the amount employers paid for all that extra work — <strong>fell by 5.8 percent.</strong> The jump in productivity was higher than expected; the cut in labor costs more than double expectations.</p></blockquote>
<p>
<blockquote>Data released on Wednesday <a href="http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2761e976-87ff-11de-82e4-00144feabdc0.html?nclick_check=1">show the US still facing strong economic headwinds</a>, as retail sales unexpectedly fell, weekly jobless claims unexpectedly rose, and foreclosures continue to roil the housing market. <br /><strong>US retail sales fell 0.1 per cent in July from June, compared with analysts’ estimates of a 0.8 per cent gain. </strong><br /><strong>Excluding auto sales,</strong> which were boosted by the popular cash-for-clunkers programme, <strong>US retailers fared even worse, dropping 0.6 per cent,</strong> compared with expectations of a 0.1 per cent gain on the month, on a seasonally-adjusted basis.<br /><strong>Foreclosure activity in the US hit a new record in July,</strong> setting its third monthly record in five months, RealtyTrac reported on Thursday. <br />Foreclosure filings, which include default notices, scheduled auctions and bank repossessions, hit 360,149, an increase of 7 per cent from June and 32 per cent on the year. One in every 355 US homes received a foreclosure notice in July, according to the online marketplace for foreclosure properties. <br />The release comes the day after the National Association of Realtors reported that an increase in foreclosure sales led to<strong> a record 15.6 per cent decline in median home values to $174,100</strong> in the second quarter from the year before. About 36 per cent of transactions in the second quarter were distressed sales, either foreclosures or short sales.</p></blockquote>
<p>We never did <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/can-we-please-broaden-our-thinking-in.html">broaden the discussion</a>.</p>
<p>We haven&#8217;t answered the question: <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/02/how-are-we-going-to-fix-money-from.html">How are we going to fix</a> the money from money economy.  Yes, we had to stabilize the banks.  That we did is not of issue, how we did it is. The approach only reinforced the money from money economy.  <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/07/tarp-neil-barofsky-rep-alan-grayson-and.html">We are pledged to $23.7 trillion.</a> (BTW, try to go get a loan and see if they don&#8217;t ask what you have co-signed onto along with what you personally have borrowed).   Our GDP as of 2000 was 1.9% of the financial turn over and the Fed thinks nothing of swapping 1/2 trillion dollars. The issue is not whether it was necessary, it is the casualness with which it was done.  You know, that billion here, billion there, soon we are talking real money?</p>
<p>We have not produced any policy that <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/its-big-one-honey-i-know-it.html">will reverse these trend lines</a> which show that personal consumption has out passed the share of income to the bottom 99% since 1996.  A trend that lasted at least 13 years from the depression and was 10 years where my chart ends in 2005 and we hadn&#8217;t had the big one yet.  We were almost 3 more years past that when this recession started.  But hey, the recession is ending.</p>

<p>There were some good responses to the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/04/define-rich.html">first posting</a> that I agreed with.  They were, could we say, jumping the gun as to how I want to proceed, however.  So, with this post I want to continue with looking at phrases/concepts/thoughts that are a part of, or were a part of any discussion regarding “rich”.  </p>
<p>Have you missed the phrase: Rat Race?  <br />Wonder why we ask: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#038;q=is+the+american+dream+dead&#038;aq=0&#038;oq=Is+the+American+Dream+">Is the American Dream dead</a>?  <br />Could it be that in an economy where “rich” is not or will not be defined, the race is won and the dream obtained?  After all, we&#8217;re all rich now!  Sodahead specifically <a href="http://www.sodahead.com/question/297362/do-you-think-the-american-dream-is-dead/">asked the question</a>. </p>
<p>We have polls regarding the Dream.  From the group: Change to Win, the <a href="http://www.changetowin.org/fileadmin/user_upload/2006_poll_memo.pdf">2006 American Dream Survey</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p>A majority of American workers feel both the country (63%) and the national economy (63%) have gotten off on the wrong track. Just 26% of workers say the country is headed in the right direction, while 28% say the national economy is headed in the right direction.</p>
<p>The most widespread serious worries of American workers today include the prospect of not being able to afford health care when they need it (a serious concern for 77%), not having enough money for retirement (77%), losing their health care benefits (72%), not being able to keep up with bills (69%), and having their standard of living slip further and further (68%).</p>
<p>When asked the open ended question of what the American Dream means to the them, respondents say it means having a good job and being able to make a comfortable living (37%) while notably, <strong>almost no one mentions being wealthy or affluent (1%).</strong> </p></blockquote>
<p> From New American Dream.org <a href="http://www.newdream.org/about/pdfs/Finalpollreport.pdf">2004 survey report</a>:<br />
<blockquote>More than 4 in 5 Americans (85%) say that our society’s priorities are out of whack.<br />Nearly all Americans (93%) agree &#8212; more than half agree strongly (52%) &#8212; that Americans are too focused on working and making money and not enough on family and community.<br />More than 4 in 5 Americans (83%) agree that they wish they had more of what really matters in life.<br /><strong>Less than 3 in 10 say that having a bigger house or apartment (29%) or nicer things (16%) would make them much more satisfied.</strong> </p></blockquote>
<p>In this survey is a chart of phrases asked to be rated in how well it describes the American Dream and importance for society on a 10 point scale.  They report the percentage that rated each phrase at 8 or higher.  The following are significant for this discussion:<br /><em>“To consume or buy what we want”.  </em>Only 55% said it described the Dream and 49% said it was important.<br /><em>“Achieving an affluent or wealthy life style”.  </em>Only 49% said it described the Dream and 44 % said it was important.<br />These are low numbers compared to the other phrases.  </p>
<p>Thus, between these two surveys, the idea of getting rich so that you can consume as you please is not a big part of the Dream.  In fact this survey found:<br />
<blockquote>Over the past 5 years, nearly half of Americans (49%) say that they have voluntarily made changes in their life which resulted in making less money.    <br />What kinds of changes have Americans who are downshifting made? One in three Americans (33%) say they have ”quit working outside the home” and more than 1 in 4 say they have either changed to a lower paying job (28%) or reduced their work hours (26%). </p></blockquote>
<p>That brings us to the phrase: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rat_race">Rat Race</a>.<br />
<blockquote>A rat race is a term used for an endless, self-defeating or pointless pursuit&#8230;The rat race is a term often used to describe work, particularly excessive work; in general terms, if one works too much, one is in the rat race.</p></blockquote>
<p> Now, consider that there were 38.8 million hits for “is the American Dream Dead” but only 3.98 million hits for “rat race”.  &#8220;Houston, we have a problem.&#8221;  People know what the American Dream is and they know we ain&#8217;t livin&#8217; it, BUT, they have no idea what they have been living.  </p>
<p>In that 3.98 million hits, <a href="http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/RetirementandWills/EscapeTheRatRace/Your5MinuteGuideToQuittingTheRatRace.aspx">only 1 MSM article</a> came up early regarding “rat race” and how to get out of it.  Early was page 2, second listing.  Contrast that with the dead American Dream search having the first 3 hits being MSM articles. </p>
<p>This is how the article from MSN Money Staff, 7/20/07 begins:<br />
<blockquote>Looking to get off the paycheck-to-paycheck treadmill or to drop out of the rat race altogether? Here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ll need: a solid plan for how you&#8217;ll spend your time and a way to either earn dramatically more or spend much, much less.</p>
<p>This is not an impossible dream. In 2004, 7.5 million U.S. households had $1 million in assets, not including their homes. The number of people worth $5 million has quadrupled in the past 10 years and numbers nearly 1 million.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, the way to get out of the race is to win the race?  Obviously they have not read what Americans believe the American Dream is.  Or, could this article be getting at just how expensive it is to have the American Dream?  Or, are they supporting the impression from the surveys that the chances of getting the Dream are slim and less so for the next generation?  After all, what is 7.5 million households compared to a <a href="http://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1129.pdf">projected 110 million by 2010</a>?</p>
<p>If we can not conceptualize (though we used to) what it is we are doing while having a feeling that we don&#8217;t like what ever it is we are doing because it is not part of the American Dream, then how can we define rich?  However, if you are rich, and you make money from money, could there be any better environment than to have the masses unable to recognize their dilemma?  Talk about putting your capital to work!  Just as there is a campaign to not define rich, there has been a campaign to make the American Dream synonymous with the goal of making money.  For instance, the purpose of business was not always defined as making money, however that is the pat answer returned today. (I&#8217;m going to write about this too some day.)  </p>
<p>Just read that MSN article again.  Nothing in there gives the reader permission to simply down size, to get off the rat race.  No, you have to make sure you have enough money.  They even suggest doubt about your being able to be happy with less.  And, in the end you may already be rich.  There closing sentence: <br />
<blockquote>On the other hand, you may not be as poor as you think. Check out GlobalRichList to get a different take on how you compare with others.</p></blockquote>
<p>The goal is to make money we are told.  You know, the rhetoric about the lazy people, those wanting more of the American Dream than they are willing to work hard enough for?  You don&#8217;t want to be like them!  Yet, the pursuit of this goal is the incarnation of the concept &#8220;Rat Race&#8221;.</p>
<p>We have had our ideas about our purpose in and of life reduced to the concept of “rat race”, while having the concept removed from our daily lexicon so that we can&#8217;t even voice what we are experiencing.  Our American dream has been reduced to  “an endless, self-defeating or pointless pursuit” while we have been losing the words to voice the experience.  Did you know, that the reason we can not remember our very early years is because as infants, we do not have use of language and thus can not form memories.  You need words and their understanding in order to structure and reason your life out.  </p>
<p>Defining “rich” is part of understanding the American Dream.  The Dream is a life style within the framing of equality of power.   The American Dream is the goal.  The goal has always had a dollar amount tied to it.  Because the Dream cost money, it is vulnerable to manipulation by those of unequal power: the rich.</p>
<p>To be continued.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m reading Kevin Phillips “Bad Money”.  I want to understand where this idea that money is made from money comes from.  On page 61 he writes:  <br />
<blockquote>In 1996 a much discussed article in Foreign Policy titled “Securities: The New World Wealth Machine” had set out the ultimate paper entrepreneurial opportunity: high-quality stocks and bonds could be issued against clusters and pools of existing loans and assets, an innovation that “requires that a state find ways to increase the market value of its stock of productive assets.”  By such a strategy,  “an economic policy that aims to achieve growth by wealth creation therefore does not attempt to increase the production of goods and services, except as a secondary objective.”  </p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1148994">Professor Edmunds</a>, the author of the article put&#8217;s it more bluntly on the first page than the quotes Mr. Phillips used. Referring to “<a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1148994">Securitization</a>&#8211; the issuance of high-quality bonds and stocks&#8230;” <br />
<blockquote>Wealth was created when a portion of income was diverted from consumption into investment of buildings, machinery and technological change.  Societies accumulated wealth slowly over generations.  Now many societies and indeed the entire world have learned how to create wealth directly. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now I don&#8217;t know but, is that not the grand slam of free lunch economics you have ever read?  How could a learned person make such a statement? </p>
<p>In fact, googling for this posting I came across a thesis by a <a href="http://www.smallisbeautiful.org/pdfs/DemMoneypart1.pdf">young man, 23 years of age </a>written for his college work in 2001 in which <a href="http://www.smallisbeautiful.org/pdfs/DemMoneypart2.pdf">he states</a>:<br />
<blockquote>What Edmunds refers to as “Securitization,” is nothing more than the shuffling of money from one market to another. However, this approach does create something known as a financial bubble; an instance in which an increase in speculation within a financial market, inflates the market value of stocks and bonds beyond their underlying value. It also results in a number of unpleasant systemic consequences.<br />First, an inflated financial market tends to exacerbate the trend for money to concentrate in the hands of the rich.<br />A second consequence of an inflated financial market is that it tends to draw money away from the productive sector that actually engages in the creation of wealth.  This can put an economy in a very tenuous position, as was evidenced by Thailand in 1997.</p></blockquote>
<p> Not bad for a student from a <a href="http://www.simons-rock.edu/about">liberal</a> arts <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon's_Rock_College">college</a> in 2001.  All I can ask is: What the hell happened to the economist and money minds advising the last 2 and now the current president?</p>
<p>Back to Mr. Phillips, page 63:<br />
<blockquote>Back in 1986, Minsky had written in Stabilizing an Unstable Economy that where as a banker&#8217;s orientation to cash flow was sober, “an emphasis by bankers on the collateral value and expected value of assets is conducive to the emergence of a fragile financial structure.”</p></blockquote>
<p>  I searched “Minsky” at AB.  He comes up as early as 2004.  Unfortunately, I could not find the actual post. I googled Professor Minsky and to my surprise found an <a href="http://www.levy.org/pubs/wp74.pdf">original document</a><br />
<blockquote>The Financial Instability Hypothesis<br />by<br />Hyman P. Minsky*<br />Working Paper No. 74<br />May 1992</p>
<p>The <strong>readily observed empirical</strong> aspect is that, from time to time, capitalist economies exhibit inflations and debt deflations which seem to have the potential to spin out of control.</p></blockquote>
<p>I guess it wasn&#8217;t to observed for the mantra I believe prior to the current fiasco was that everything was smooth sailing, the oceans have been tamed by man.  <br />In this paper, I believe the following is the relevant aspect of his theory that we need to learn:</p>
<blockquote><p>The theoretical argument of the financial instability hypothesis starts from the characterization of the economy as a capitalist economy with expensive capital assets and a complex, sophisticated financial system.</p>
<p>This Keynes &#8220;veil of money&#8221; is different from the Quantity<br />Theory of money &#8220;veil of money.&#8221;  The Quantity Theory &#8220;veil of money&#8221; has the trading exchanges in commodity markets be of goods for money and money for goods: therefore, the exchanges are really of goods for goods. The Keynes veil implies that money is connected with financing through time.</p></blockquote>
<p>It is the following in Professor Minsky&#8217;s paper that I believe would lead someone to make the statements Professor Edmunds made: <br />
<blockquote>Thus, in a capitalist economy the past, the present, and the future are linked not only by capital assets and labor force characteristics but also by financial relations. <strong>The key financial relationships link the creation and the ownership of capital assets to the structure of financial relations and changes in this structure</strong>&#8230;In contrast to the orthodox Quantity Theory of money, the financial instability hypothesis takes banking seriously as a profit-seeking activity.<br />Banks seek profits by financing activity and bankers. Like all entrepreneurs in a capitalist economy, bankers are aware that innovation assures profits. Thus, bankers (using the term generically for all intermediaries in finance), whether they be brokers or dealers, are merchants of debt who strive to innovate in the assets they acquire and the liabilities they market. <strong>This innovative characteristic of banking and finance invalidates the fundamental presupposition of the orthodox Quantity Theory of money </strong>to the effect that there is an unchanging &#8220;money&#8221; item whose velocity of circulation is sufficiently close to being constant: hence, changes in this money&#8217;s supply have a linear proportional relation to a well defined price level.</p></blockquote>
<p>And thus is born the idea that you can make money from money.  That is if you ignor that Professor Minsky does not state that finance stands alone, or that &#8220;an economic policy that aims to achieve growth by wealth creation therefore does not attempt to increase the production of goods and services, except as a secondary objective&#8221;.  On the contrary, he says nothing about primacy.  He just notes that what is missing in the Quantity Theory is finance.  <br />
<blockquote>Thus, in a capitalist economy the past, the present, and the future are linked not only by capital assets and labor force characteristics but also by financial relations. </p></blockquote>

<p>Via C &#038; L via CR comes <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/opinion/01endintro.html?_r=1">the NYT asking</a> when will the recession be over.  They have 11different responses.  Roubini is there suggesting we could see an L curve.<br />
<blockquote>We now face a 1 in 3 chance that, if appropriate policies are not put in place, this ugly U-shaped recession may turn into a more virulent L-shaped near-depression or stag-deflation (a deadly combination of economic stagnation and price deflation) like the one Japan experienced in the 1990s after its real estate and equity bubbles burst.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course there is one response titled: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/opinion/01poole.html">Stop the Bailouts</a>. Can you guess the ideology? (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kato_(The_Green_Hornet)">Hint</a>.)</p>
<p>Calculated Risk highlighted  STEPHEN S.ROACH (Chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia),  A. MICHAEL SPENCE (Stanford Professor, Nobel prize, economics) and GEORGE COOPER (author of “The Origin of Financial Crises: Central Banks, Credit Bubbles and the Efficient Market Fallacy”).  All three came up with 2010/2011.  Although, they all noted &#8220;if&#8217;s&#8221; as to government action, including the world&#8217;s governments and maybe lingering effects.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go with the following.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/opinion/01ferguson.html">Niall Ferguson</a> is a professor at Harvard and the author of “The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World.” <br />
<blockquote>This is a crisis of excessive debt, the end of the Age of Leverage. It will take longer than a few more months to resolve bank and household insolvency, especially with asset prices continuing to fall so rapidly.  Even with zero interest rates and huge deficits, Japan suffered a “lost decade” in the 1990s — and that was when the rest of the world was doing well. This recession is taking place as the rest of the world is doing even worse than the United States. The collapse of trade as measured by East Asian export data is petrifying&#8230;At the moment, I find it quite easy to imagine two consecutive years of contraction. And I don’t rule out two more lean years after that.</p></blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/opinion/01reinhart.html">Carmen M. Reinhart</a> is a professor of economics at the University of Maryland.<br />
<blockquote>Counting the months of decline, however, is a narrow gauge of distress. A better metric is the length of time it takes the economy to recover to the level of per capita income at its prior peak. </p>
<p>After the most severe banking crises around the world in the postwar period, the economy has taken an average of four years to return to its previous peak in personal income. After the Depression, it took the United States 10 years.</p></blockquote>
<p>Wow? Someone basing the issue of the recession and it&#8217;s conclusion on how much income people have. </p>
<p>Do you think we can get her to consider the split of that income?  After all, in that 10 year depression recovery the top 1% share declined from 22.35% to 16.68%.  But (big but) in 1936 it popped up to 19.29%, then we had 1937.  By 1939 (10 yrs) it was back to 16.18% and never saw anything close to it until 1986&#8217;s 15.92% (from 12.67the year before).  We hit 22% in 2005!</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Ok, here are my basic issues with the substance of President Obama&#8217;s speech. First, may I remind everyone that as of 11/08 I declared my divorce successful.  Has it become my mission accomplish moment?</p>
<p>I heard this:<br />
<blockquote>“And we will expand our commitment to charter schools. but as a father when I say that responsibility for our children&#8217;s education must begin at home.” </p></blockquote>
<p>And thought: 2 tier education system/vouchers, no thank you.  Education begins at home when home means one parent has the time to spend at home oppose to both working.</p>
<p>I heard this:<br />
<blockquote>“And we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social Security, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all Americans.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And thought: Are you freak&#8217;n kidding me!  In this time of financial collapse we&#8217;re still going to talk about turning an insurance for the masses against the follies of finance into some form to include finance?  The entire reason we want to create jobs is because we have suddenly realized that the vast, vast majority do not earn their money from money.  Tax free?  Has he not heard of 401K, IRA and all it&#8217;s versions, HSA, higher education accounts?  Italy?</p>
<p>I heard this:<br />
<blockquote>“Yesterday, I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And thought: Yeah, how&#8217;d that work for the last administration who made such a declaration?  Did he have to say “in half”?  Has his advisors not taught him about the blip during the FDR recovery?  Only one way I can think of doing this: Raise taxes where the money is and whack the defense budget in half and I mean take a swipe at all moneys related to security.  Are we really $1 trillion dollars worth of paranoid?</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush<br />Updated comment at end</p>
<p>So, now that the Democratic Party has the majority and the White House, why am I not hearing about the use of the Nuclear Option?  I mean, it occurred to me that if there was a way to end the partisan old ways, the Nuclear Option is it.  It sure worked well for the Bush administration.  You need 60 votes?  Bring in the non-executive executive senate menber: Biden.  Oh, you think there needs to be a tie to be broken before our hatchet man can be used?  Well I have news for you.  Being that everything comes down to breaking the 60 vote line to get anything done, by precedent of calling for a record number of filibusters the Republicans have set the new definition of a tie: 59/41.  Biden makes it 60/41.</p>
<p>This gets me to the trust issue and I&#8217;m going to toot my own horn here for those who think human capital is bunk regarding getting us out of this mess. (Did I mention the flower shop was off 13% for Christmas and 45% for January?  Yeah, I got skin in this game.)  </p>
<p>Seems on the same day I posted my message to the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/attention-republicansblue-dog.html">Republicans and the Blue Dogs</a>, a man officially of the economic science posted on the same subject (via C &#038; L via Naked Capitalism).<br /><a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/02/fiscal-expansions-in-submerging-markets-the-case-of-the-usa-and-the-uk/#more-428">Willem Buiter</a>.</p>
<p>Here is what I said:<br />
<blockquote>The greatest harm that is coming from the republican&#8217;s drive to instill their minority will on the many out of selfish want, is to further the demise of the people&#8217;s trust. For the blue dogs it is their ignorance of their economic ideology that creates the mistrust. The republicans/blue dogs, and those helping them by lending their &#8220;professionalism&#8221;, think they are only effecting a political strategy. In truth, they are destroying the very basis for the wealth they desire. Their entire campaign for decades to discredit, to instill mistrust in the primary institution we have, the US (We the People) government, has been the primary cause to our economic decline. To increase the level of distrust is to decrease the available “intangible capital” which is 77% of our wealth generating power.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Here is Willem Buiter:<br />
<blockquote>As part of this widespread erosion of social capital, both citizens and markets lost faith in the ability of governments to commit themselves to any future course of action that was not validated, at each future point in time, as the most opportunistic course of action at that future point in time &#8211; what macroeconomists call time-consistent policies and game theorists call ’subgame-perfect’ strategies.</p>
<p>This morality tale has important consequences for a government’s ability to conduct effective countercyclical policy.  For a fiscal stimulus (current tax cut or public spending increase) to boost demand, it is necessary that the markets and the public at large believe that sooner or later, measures will be taken to reverse the tax cut or spending increase in present value terms.  If markets and the public at large no longer believe that the authorities will assure fiscal sustainability by raising future taxes or cutting future public expenditure by the necessary amounts, they will conclude that the government plans either to permanently monetize the increased amounts of public debt resulting from the fiscal stimulus, or that it will default on its debt obligations. </p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Buiter is prescribing a different solution to the lack of trust than what I&#8217;m going to suggest.  He thinks more money to the banks is needed to promote lending.  Well, isn&#8217;t that kind of giving to those you know you can not trust, not to mention just adding to the debt that he notes no one seems to want to consider?  He did state the following as part of his “morality tale”: <br />
<blockquote>During the decade leading up to the crisis, current account deficits increased steadily and became unsustainable.  Strong domestic investment (much of it in unproductive residential construction) outstripped domestic saving. Government budget discipline dissipated; fiscal policy became pro-cyclical.  Financial regulation and supervision was weak to non-existent, <strong>encouraging credit</strong> and asset price booms and bubbles.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hope was the word.  Trust is the need.  I&#8217;ve seen and lived what the Republicans and Blue Dogs can do.  I&#8217;m willing to take a chance for the benefit of building future trust, thus building with the 77% of our power, thus nurturing hope, and let Obama send in Biden to the Senate.  Hell, maybe it&#8217;s time they come up with the unitary vice executive theory and take it for a spin in the Senate!   In-other-words, my solution is for Obama et al to just take god damn control and do what they want, then we&#8217;ll have something to compare to along with &#8220;Republican brand&#8221; bipartisanship. We can decide come November 2012 how the brands compare. (Catch that “bringing business to governance” lingo of how to speak civics?)  </p>
<p>We survived the last 4 years, we know where we&#8217;ll be if we keep going as we are (no thanks to our free press), so I say let the Dem&#8217;s pull a republican move: redefine what a tie is, have the Obama&#8217;s legal council write up the unitary vice executive theory and send in Biden to the Senate.</p>
<p>I trust that it will not be worse than what we have now.  And that, &#8220;my friends&#8221; is using our fullest economic power.<br />Almost forgot: Can we please <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/can-we-please-broaden-our-thinking-in.html">broaden the discussion now</a>?</p>
<p>Update: Two commentors noted that the tie break may not work as I suggested.  RonE notes there is no need for the 60, just change the rules to a simple majority.  TStockmann notes that we would not get all the Dem&#8217;s to go along.  I assumed the Dems would act tribal if they had someone to lead them, that is what is needed when you are fighting another tribe  You can&#8217;t beat the other tribe by acting all independent thinking virtuous as to the ideal bipartisanship.</p>
<p>But here is where my plan works.   We&#8217;re going to have the unitary vice executive who is president of the Senate just as soon as Obama has his attorney write it up.  Or, maybe Biden should just have his attorney write it up ala Cheney.   Then, he goes in and changes the rules (because he&#8217;s the Unitary Vice Executive President) to a simple majority, we&#8217;re golden.  </p>

                                <p>I was pontificating earlier today about how many of the now-unemployed Financial Services workers were, in a previous life, engineers of one stripe or another, and if we&#8217;re going to be doing things with the stimulus bill such as re-engineer the power grid, some of them may well decide to return to their previous life. And with a 60% increase in the number of people unemployed since May of 2007, there should be some decent competition.</p>
<p>Leave it to my old friend <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/opinion/l05econ.html?_r=1&#038;scp=1&#038;sq=Bisson&#038;st=cse">Terry Bisson to completely undermine that argument</a>:<br />
<blockquote>I think the big Wall Street bonuses are a fine idea.</p>
<p>Without them, Wall Streeters will all look for other jobs. Do we really want these greedy incompetent clowns building our houses, teaching our children or driving our cabs?</p></blockquote>

                                <p>(UPDATE: For some reason the detailed outlay tables vanished from the PDF linked to here. Leading some to put on their tin foil hats. Fear not, I have uploaded them and they appear under the fold). (UPDATE 2: Larger images at <a target="_blank" href="http://bruceweb.blogspot.com/2009/01/cbo-tables-bigger-images.html">CBO Tables</a>)<br />Via Prof. K. It turns out the &#8216;suppressed&#8217; CBO &#8216;Report&#8217; turned out to be a partial version of the appendix to the full estimate released concurrently with the filing of the bill. Meaning some people can take off their tin-foil hats. And BTW Boehner&#8217;s numbers are wrong precisely because the document he used was incomplete. In any event here is the real deal.<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/99xx/doc9968/hr1.pdf">Congressional Budget Office Cost Estimate: H.R. 1 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a> and key grafs:<br />
<blockquote>Assuming enactment in mid-February, CBO estimates that the bill would increase outlays by $93 billion during the remaining several months of fiscal year 2009, by $225 billion in fiscal year 2010 (which begins on October 1), by $159 billion in 2011, and by a total of $604 billion over the 2009-2019 period. That spending includes outlays from discretionary appropriations in Division A of the bill and direct spending resulting from Division B.</p>
<p>In addition, CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimate that enacting the provisions in Division B would reduce revenues by $76 billion in fiscal year 2009, by $131 billion in fiscal year 2010, and by a net of $212 billion over the 2009-2019 period.</p>
<p>Combining the spending and revenue effects of H.R. 1, CBO estimates that enacting the bill would increase federal budget deficits by $170 billion over the remaining months of fiscal year 2009, by $356 billion in 2010, by $174 billion in 2011, and by $816 billion over the 2009-2019 period.</p></blockquote>
<p>52.6% of projected spending by the end of the first nineteen months (end FY 2010). It helps to use complete numbers.<br />As noted above the outlay tables can be found under the fold.<br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYBzGe_YwWI/AAAAAAAAAEI/KV91mhVJcDs/s1600-h/CBO_Est_19.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYBzGe_YwWI/AAAAAAAAAEI/KV91mhVJcDs/s320/CBO_Est_19.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYBzGlC3zLI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/S7s0H-3m4o4/s1600-h/CBO_Est_20.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYBzGlC3zLI/AAAAAAAAAEQ/S7s0H-3m4o4/s320/CBO_Est_20.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYBzG5E20aI/AAAAAAAAAEY/5Em8vCyx9DU/s1600-h/CBO_Est_21.jpg"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYBzG5E20aI/AAAAAAAAAEY/5Em8vCyx9DU/s320/CBO_Est_21.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYBzGytgQtI/AAAAAAAAAEg/3_AsSyNkZHA/s1600-h/CBO_Est_22.jpg"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYBzGytgQtI/AAAAAAAAAEg/3_AsSyNkZHA/s320/CBO_Est_22.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a><br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYBzG7Bpm0I/AAAAAAAAAEo/pnTYyi-PbNk/s1600-h/CBO_Est_23.jpg"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_fjW71B3WLTQ/SYBzG7Bpm0I/AAAAAAAAAEo/pnTYyi-PbNk/s320/CBO_Est_23.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
