                                <p>Robert Waldmann</p>
<p>Brad DeLong boldly attempts to exhaustively list the factors which can affect the value of a fixed income asset.   This is some Mac generated i document and I can&#8217;t cut and paste. Go <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/01/delong-what-has-happened-to-milton-friedmans-chicago-school-draft.html#comments">here</a> and search for &#8220;there are four&#8221;. </p>
<p>The four are called &#8220;default&#8221;, &#8220;the safe real interest rate&#8221;, &#8220;risk&#8221;, and adverse selection.</p>
<p>I view the assertion that &#8220;there are four&#8221; as a challenge and quibble after the jump.</p>
<p>First the instruments in question promise nominal payments so the safe interest rate in question is the safe nominal interest rate not the safe real interest rate.  The word &#8220;real&#8221; is essentially a typo.</p>
<p>Second &#8220;default&#8221; and &#8220;risk&#8221; are the same things for fixed income instruments (clearly what Brad is discussing).  By &#8220;risk&#8221; I assume he means &#8220;risk bearing capacity&#8221; or &#8220;risk aversion&#8221;.  However, default is a much broader problem than Brad seems willing to admit.  He counts exactly two sources of default risk &#8212; 1 trillion in housing related defaults and 3 more trillion from defaults caused by the recession.  This leaves out other sources of changes in estimated default risk (not risk aversion or risk bearing caspacity but risk).</p>
<p>That is, I see a fifth cause of the decline in asset values.  I think many assets were over-valued in the past, because the ratings agencies were tricked or cashing in on their late lamented excellent reputations (or both).  The loss of confidence in said agencies causes an increase in estimated risk not because risk has increased or risk aversion has increased but because the old estimates are now known to be bogus.</p>
<p>More generally, risk modeling by traders was similarly complete nonsense.  I don&#8217;t know to what extent the traders were tricked and to what extent they were in on the scam (nor I suspect do they).  </p>
<p>Structured finance created a huge illusion of wealth by creating an illusion of safety.  The financial engineers knew how the agencies rated (the agencies explained for a consulting fee) and how traders estimate &#8220;value at risk&#8221;.  They knew people assumed (or pretended to assume) that all stochastic variables are normally distributed.  Thus it was profitable to sell instruments with skewed returns (fat lower tails) unless the rare negative event occurred during the testing period (in which case the instruments could be re-engineered).  A senior tranche of a pool of moderately risky assets has a skewed distribution. </p>
<p>Similarly money could be made by reducing own variance for a given beta by pooling assets and issuing claims on the pool.  The variance of an average is less than the average variance.  The covariance of an average and the market portfolio is the average covariance.  <a href="http://theamericanscene.com/2008/12/23/ahi-quanto-a-dir-qual-era-e-cosa-dura-esta-selva-selvaggia-e-aspra-e-forte-che-nel-pensier-rinova-la-paura">Thus a claim on a pool of BBB rated corporate bonds was rated AAA</a>.  Turning BBB to AAA is worth a lot of money except for the fact that it was a scam (investors could pool themselves &#8212; they don&#8217;t seem to have understood that pre-pooling reduces the benefit to them of their own pooling &#8212; or they were in on the scam).</p>
<p>That is there were trillions of fantasy dollars created out of nothing by financial engineering (on top of whatever real wealth had been created by financial engineering which genuinely made better insurance and diversification possible).  The loss of that illusion can&#8217;t be estimated easily as  &#8220;housing related defaults&#8221; (and note my example has nothing to do with housing or recessions).  </p>
<p>The risk of a nationwide decline in house prices was estimated at 0 by S&#038;P (I am not exaggerating).  Now there has been such a decline, and they must admit that there is the risk of another such decline in the future.  Even if the current decline costs just $ 1 trillion, the future possible declines also cost money.</p>
<p>So much of the wealth was an illusion which won&#8217;t come back soon.  This end of systematic miss-estimation of risk is not on your list.</p>
<p>Also institutions took huge gigantic bets against each other (as in AIG lost writing CDSs).  This increases counter party risk.  No one knows if a counter party is solvent.  That reduces the value of a huge number of instruments.  The damage could have been done without involving the housing industry or the stock market if, say, investment bank CEOs played a really high stakes poker game and all claimed to have won money.  Also bankruptcy is costly.  Even if the CEOs had played hundred billion ante poker on camera, wealth would have been destroyed and more wealth would have been shifted from investors to lawyers.  This is another item not on your list.</p>
<p>Finally, much of the strange new finance was designed to help agents avoid prudential rules and regulations which they considered to be costly.  Now they have learned two things.  First that the regulations weren&#8217;t so pointless so they will have to pay that cost to avoid bankruptcy.  Second they will be audited by banking regulators, trustees etc and found wanting.   This last point is semi redundant as it amounts to an increase in perceived risk or a reduction in perceived capacity to bear risk (default or risk in Brad&#8217;s terms).  However, it explains why I keep speculating that this that or the other operator was in on the scam.</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>I should title this: <em>Yeah, it is just like 1929 you freak&#8217;n see, hear and speak no inequality monkeys. </em></p>
<p>I have this pile of income data sorted out from Saez&#8217;s work (the GDP is BEA).  My thoughts regarding our economy is that income inequality (or equality) matters.  It matters so much, that it is the all defining focus of government in a democracy.  Every policy made should be judged against this goal of ever greater equality as we use the tool called “economy” for the betterment of our lives.</p>
<p>For most (even the tippy-top earners), the biggest share of income is not earned from money, but from labor, whether physical or cognitive.  Because of this, there must be effort as reflected in our policy toward regulation and initiatives that continually work to equalize the share of income.  I am confident, that just as Cactus showed there is a low and high to top marginal rates correlating with GDP growth rates, the same is true for share of income.  That&#8217;s my thoughts.</p>
<p>I sorted out the share of income in dollars and percentages in the past and have posted them.  This time I look at per capita income and compare them to GDP.</p>
<p>Starting at the low point for both groups in 1933, we see $6142/person (16.46% of the total personal income) for the top 1% and $315/person for the rest.   The following chart shows the years of income and GDP doubling along with the top&#8217;s percentage share.  I took the starting income and kept doubling it to find the year closest.  A + or – means the actual income is before or after the year (between 2 years).<br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SVcAMjpCqSI/AAAAAAAAAMo/_NZyrS_GtOc/s1600-h/Income,+GDP+doubling+chart.JPG"><img src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SVcAMjpCqSI/AAAAAAAAAMo/_NZyrS_GtOc/s400/Income,+GDP+doubling+chart.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a>For the top, the number of years to double are as follows: 9,19, <strong>12</strong>, 7, 5, 11, 9<br />For the bottom 99 the number of years to double are: 8, 7, 17, <strong>9</strong>, 7, 15, <br />For GDP the number of years to double are: 8, 5, 11, 11, <strong>8</strong>, 7, 12, 13 <br />The bold number is the last doubling before 1976.</p>
<p>If we look at 2005 incomes, it is clear the trend for years to income doubling was increasing for the 99%.   For this group, 9 years past the last doubling, there has only been a 34.5% increase where as the top has doubled.   It  appears that the best income percentage for both the top and the rest is around 10 to 12%.  Based on my <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/its-big-one-honey-i-know-it.html">prior posting</a>, I will say with confidence that once the 1%&#8217;ers increase their share to 16% of the income we are screwed.  That is because, it was as the 1%&#8217;ers passed through the 16% mark as their share declined (the income low point in 1933) that the post 1929 economy started its turn upward.  On the other end of this time span, it was 1996 that the 1%&#8217;ers passed through the 16% point as their share increased.  1996is the year that the 99%ers income fell below the personal consumption line and has stayed there since.  Can you say deficit spending?  Another funny thing about the 30&#8217;s, the second recession, the top 1% hit 19.26% of the income in 1936.  The WW2 turn around?  The top 1%&#8217;ers share finally went below 16% in 1941 and never turned back.</p>
<p>However, here is the meat.  Using 1976 as the center point of the range because it is the low point of the share of income for the top 1%, there are 5 times that GDP doubled for an average of 8.6 years per doubling.  This during the time that income share was becoming more equal.  As income became less equal over the next 32 years, there are only 3 doublings of GDP or once every 10.6 years.  Also, the time between doubling is increasing to more than during the prior 43 years.</p>
<p>Now, for the class war aspect.  In the first 43 years, the top 1% saw their income double only 3 times (1 every 14.3 yrs) compared to the bottom 99% seeing theirs double 4 times (1 every 10.75 yrs).  During the next 32 years, the top 1% has experienced 4 doublings, one every 8 years compared to the 99% experiencing this only twice, one every 11 years. </p>
<p>Here is the graph that illustrates the relationship of shifting income share and GDP growth.  Following Spencer&#8217;s past suggestion, the graph  is a logarithmic scale.<br /><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SVcAEvLjaeI/AAAAAAAAAMg/wakcvhEiue4/s1600-h/Income+per+capita+vs+GDP+graph+12-28-08.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_ea3-LcbrX8A/SVcAEvLjaeI/AAAAAAAAAMg/wakcvhEiue4/s400/Income+per+capita+vs+GDP+graph+12-28-08.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a><br />Basically, increasing of income was more equal and the economy grew more as the top was losing share.  The post 1976 economic policy we have been following has quite frankly been killing our economy. Yeah, it sure benefited the top 1%, they got their&#8217;s. But, it could not last because, you can not have one group taking more out of the economic growth faster than it can grow.  That, boy&#8217;s and girls is the lesson of the first 43 year compared to the last 32 years.  For the first 43 years, GDP doubling was always ahead of the income.  For the next 32 years, GDP growth was always behind the income which was do to the top 1%&#8217;s share.  Their&#8217;s is the only income that increased faster than the economy.  In chart form it looks like this:<br />First 43 years doubling: GDP 8.6 yrs,  99%&#8217;ers  10.75 yrs,  1%&#8217;ers 14.3 yrs.<br />Next 32 years doubling: GDP 10.6 yrs,  99%&#8217;ers 11 yrs,  1%&#8217;ers 8 yrs.</p>
<p>You know what else this is?  It is the difference between reducing debt or increasing debt: Saving or spending tomorrow&#8217;s money.  Unified budget (illegal) or general budget.    </p>
<p>So, what should economic policy in a democracy strive to do?  Promote more equality in the nation&#8217;s income which everyone helps to produce thus giving everybody a more equitable rise in their standard of living or promote the top 1%&#8217;s growth and the hell with all the rest?  The rest being 99% of the population, the overall economic growth, the deficit, quality of life (retirement, health care, free time, better life for future generations) and just plain happier people who don&#8217;t find a need to fight with everyone else on the planet. </p>
<p>Personally, between this info and my post titled “<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/its-big-one-honey-i-know-it.html">It&#8217;s the big one honey, I know it</a>&#8230;”,I think it&#8217;s rather clear exactly what needs to be promoted with policy.  In case it&#8217;s not clear, there is this post “<a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2007/12/in-beginning-there-was-income.html">In the Beginning there was Income</a>”.</p>
<p>Such policy if implemented will also act as the stop gap for this current downward trend better than anything proposed so far because it will be returning to the true purpose of an economy in a democracy like ours.  Or, we can keep talking in quintiles hiding the truth and pretending that it&#8217;s just a housing bubble, and people spending to much, and a credit freeze and bad regulation and oil and lack of stimulus spending and it is not really like 1929 and&#8230;</p>

<blockquote>Honda Motor Co. now expects 185 billion yen ($2.06 billion) in group net profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2009 &#8212; less than a third of the 600 billion yen it earned last fiscal year.<br />For every yen the dollar declines, Honda loses about 18 billion yen ($200 million) in operating profit. In trading Wednesday, the dollar fell as low as 88.15 yen.</p></blockquote>
<p>And is making some changes based on the results: <br />
<blockquote>Underlining the tough times ahead, Fukui refused to set a vehicles sales target for 2009 &#8212; an unusual move for Honda.<br />To take responsibility for the faltering results, Honda directors will take a 10 percent pay cut and further bonus reductions are likely, he said.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Honda said it was pulling out of the glamorous but expensive Formula One racing to save costs and focus on its core car business.  (Hey, it&#8217;s not NASCAR so who care?  I do.)</p>
<p>Honda lowered its sales forecast for the fiscal year through March by 13 percent to 10.4 trillion yen ($116.9 billion).</p>
<p>The company also trimmed annual investment spending by 60 billion yen ($674 million) to about 650 billion yen ($7.3 billion) to cut costs during hard times, including scrapping plans to introduce the Acura luxury line in Japan by 2010. Plans to develop a successor to the NSX sportscar were also canceled.</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are layoffs: <br />
<blockquote>Honda had already said it was cutting 760 temporary workers in Japan, or nearly 18 percent of its Japan temporary work force of 4,300. On Wednesday, Honda said another 450 temporary workers in Japan will be reduced through February. </p></blockquote>
<p> That&#8217;s all they have to cut?  No regulars getting the axe? Don&#8217;t they know it&#8217;s the workers fault?</p>
<p>Toyota has done some math too.<br />
<blockquote>Toyota is also reducing production. In a key setback, Toyota said earlier this week that it&#8217;s delaying indefinitely the start of production at its plant in Blue Springs, Mississippi. The plant had been scheduled to begin in 2010&#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p> Hey Cochran baby, how&#8217;s that work&#8217;n for ya in old Mississippi? </p>

                                <p>by: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>Ok, the auto CEO&#8217;s are all lined up.  They get asked the populist setup question: Are you going to sell your jets?  And they just sat there, as dumb looking as could be.  They didn&#8217;t say a word.  Not a word!  To me, that proved they were the wrong people for the current job because either they did not know to answer or did not know what to answer with.</p>
<p>If the CEO&#8217;s not knowing to answer a basic setup question that should have been anticipated (read they should have gotten coached better if they did at all) is not enough to question their management ability (it also suggests the boards have not been asking any unexpected questions either over the term of their positions) well, consider <a href="http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/20081205_a_toyota_takeover_could_save_gm/">the following</a>: <br />
<blockquote>Last year General Motors ranked as the fifth-largest company in the world, with sales of $207 billion and a loss of around $2 billion. Toyota, meanwhile, ranked in 2007 as the sixth-largest company in the world, with sales approaching $205 billion and a profit of $14 billion. </p>
<p>Those numbers changed dramatically in 2008, with GM falling from fifth to ninth with sales of $182 billion and a loss of nearly $39 billion, while Toyota moved up to fifth place with sales of $230 billion and a profit of $15 billion.</p></blockquote>
<p>But, here is what really got me as I watched GM&#8217;s CFO, Ray Young (Mr. Young was instrumental in putting together GM&#8217;s long-term restructuring plan after Congress demanded that the Big Three present such plans&#8230;) on <a href="http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&#038;products_id=282718-5">Washington Journal on 12/5/08</a><br />
<blockquote>&#8230;and that&#8217;s the reason why we support the concept yesterday, of this oversight committee to supervise the restructuring of our industry.<br />I think from our perspective, we&#8217;re very open.  There&#8217;s talk about having an automotive Czar designated by the government to look at the entire industry.<br />&#8230;the advantage of having this oversight committee and having an industry czar is the fact that they can look at the American automobile industry on a wholistic basis and determine how we can restructure the industry to be globally competitive.  </p></blockquote>
<p>In all this time of GM&#8217;s existence they have not been able to assess the market as a whole including globally to determine what was needed in order for them to be “globally competitive”?  What the hell have they been looking at?  Isn&#8217;t this suppose to be part of basic business management skill? Now they want government help to figure this out?  Is this not asking for central market control light, as in China and Russia American style? I don&#8217;t know whether to laugh at them or cry for us.</p>
<p>Remind me, what freakin&#8217; side of the fuel mileage standard argument were they on back in the 80&#8217;s <a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/political-science/speeches/bush.dir/b48.txtp">and 90&#8217;s</a>?<br />
<blockquote>July 21, 1992<br />                THE CLINTON-GORE CAFE PROPOSALS:<br />                   LOSS OF JOBS, LOSS OF LIVES<br />CLINTON: &#8220;In my administration, we&#8217;ll&#8230;seek to raise the average<br />goal for automakers to 40 mpg by the year 2000, 45 mpg by the<br />year 2020.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>And which industry took the positive concept of <a href="http://laramie.willshireltd.com/DynamicObsolescence.html">dynamic obsolescence </a>(continuous improvement to promote sales, excluding the wastefulness issue, that&#8217;s a different post) and turned it into the negative of <a href="http://repairny.com/our-world/86-planned-obsolescence-planned-junk.html">planned obsolescence</a>(early demise of the item to promote accelerated sales)?</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m reading this response by Mr. Young wrong, and it is not that they are admitting that they don&#8217;t know what they have been doing, that they don&#8217;t know how to assess the market local or otherwise, in a way that leads them to be sustainably competitive.  </p>
<p>Maybe they are playing congress.  Sort of a: Hey, sure we&#8217;ll agree to some government oversight (is that all we have to say to get the money?).  But, if that is true, then they are being dishonest in their genuineness.  They are acting as frauds which means we would be fools to give them the money without expecting some management personnel changes.  We will have been played.</p>
<p>Personally I think it is both that they don&#8217;t know how to manage by virtue of the market profitability numbers presented above and by their very own CFO&#8217;s admission to wanting a communism economics inspired concept put in place for their market.  Though Mr. Young mostly noted Japan&#8217;s automotive market approach, so I guess he wants more of a socialistic form of central market control.  Imagine that, GM wants some form of socialism with a dash of communism.  They even use the Russian term for a central planner.  So, what say you of the <a href="http://thinkprogress.org/2008/11/20/conservatives-blame-cafe/">republican persuasion</a>?  </p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Krugman">Professor Krugman</a> has been having problems with a person named Amity Shlaes.  Well, actually he&#8217;s having a problem more with what she is professing.  Amity is talking about The Great One&#8217;s relationship to today&#8217;s sickly economy and prescribing a plan of treatment.  Doctor Krugman is noting the errors in Amity&#8217;s examination findings and her plan of treatment.  All I can say is, Paul, you&#8217;re arguing with Sarah Palin here.  Amity&#8217;s not even a nurse, never mind a doctor.  Let me expound.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/shlaes122001.asp">article of Amity&#8217;s</a> from 12/20/01 suggesting what is need to fix the sickly economy then: <br />
<blockquote>The result of this labour flexibility is that the US has been able to sustain productivity growth at the outset of recession, something of which virtually no other developed economy is capable. Because US laws make it relatively easy to dismiss workers, companies do not have to waste negotiating time or cash on buying workers out of contracts. <br />When recovery does come, they will have more cash to invest. Because Ford can lose workers, it can also afford to bid for market share by selling cars interest-free. What is more, there will also be cash in the till with which to rehire workers.<br />There are lessons in this picture for all three countries. For the US, the message is: do not do anything to disturb the dynamism of the labour force. This means that the well intentioned plan to expand benefits for the unemployed in &#8220;economic growth and security&#8221; legislation is wrong-headed. For while nationally subsidised unemployment schemes may not target specific companies, they do throw sand into the gears of dynamic economies. <br />For Germany, or Japan, the message is: freer labour policies are crucial to future growth.<br />It is an old truth but worth remembering: &#8220;hire and fire&#8221; also means &#8220;fire to hire&#8221;. The best insurance for growth is creating a culture where workers believe that spring will come and, with it, a new job.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hire and fire also means “fire to hire”?  “You gotta be cruel to be kind in the right measure, cruel to be kind it&#8217;s a very good sign&#8230;”</p>
<p>In <a href="http://www.amityshlaes.com/bio.php">Amity Shlaes bio</a> it is reported:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;2003, she spent several months at the American Academy in Berlin as the JP Morgan Fellow for finance and economy.</p></blockquote>
<p>Here is the J.P. Morgan Fellows program:<br />
<blockquote>The J.P. Morgan Fellows Program was established in 1996 to promote diversity in graduate business schools and in the Investment Bank. The Program provides half-tuition scholarships for up to 10 first-year MBA students at five of the United States’ top graduate business schools.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now, this is very interesting in that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amity_Shlaes">wikipedia</a> notes: <br />
<blockquote>Shlaes graduated from Jonathan Edwards College, Yale University magna cum laude[1] with a bachelor’s degree in English in 1982 (with reference to Yale alumni directory)</p></blockquote>
<p>Her bio does not mention this bit of education.  It mentions nothing related to college at all!  Nor does her <a href="http://www.cfr.org/bios/7536/amity_shlaes.html">bio at the Council on Foreign Relations </a><br />mention anything more than being an adjunct professor at NYU&#8217;s Stern School of Business.  Yet, her career is full of editing jobs.  So, is she teaching business?  History?    </p>
<p>Thus, we have a bachelor’s in english (obviously academically capable) receiving a fellowship for MBA students at the top business schools being used for a trip of &#8220;several months&#8221; to an academy for promoting German/American bonding.  <a href="http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=American_Academy_in_Berlin">Via Source Watch</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The Academy&#8217;s web site states that it &#8220;presents an English-language public program at the Hans Arnhold Center [each semester]. The program is designed to present the work of fellows both to colleagues and interested members of the public &#8230;</p></blockquote>
<p>The <a href="http://www.americanacademy.de/home/fellows/">Academy&#8217;s fellowship</a> is only one semester and &#8220;occasionally&#8221; a full year.  </p>
<p>To be fair, at her book page it does state that her first book, the subject of which was Germany came about from her <em>“studying and working in Germany starting in the fall of 1982.”</em>   It just does not describe the studying and working.  Her bio at the CFR states she worked for the WSJ/Europe from 1986 to 1990 as the Editorial Features Editor.   </p>
<p>The question: Is a bachelor&#8217;s in English with a lot of editing work experience editing editorials enough to get an MBA related fellowship to an Academy that gives English speaking lectures which then qualifies you to be a respected commentator of worldly proportions regarding today&#8217;s economic crap all put into an historical perspective?  Not really, but&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll accept a self taught historian, a self taught economist, but just as I&#8217;m a self taught guitarist of 40 years, I&#8217;m considered an amateur as should she be.  There is nothing in Amity&#8217;s bio that suggests that all the honoraries she has received, both in job and awards, are related to anything more than the fact that she is very good with English language.  She was an English major, she writes and reviews writing for God&#8217;s sake.  Though, even in all of that writing there is no list of authorship within peer reviewed journals.  None.  So, how accurate is it to state at her bio page of the CFR this:<br />
<blockquote>Expertise: Germany; Russia; history; economics; U.S. tax policy; relative competitiveness.</p></blockquote>
<p>Is this expertise bestowed by peers in these subjects or is it expertise based on editing authorship of these subjects?</p>
<p>Professor Krugman, that&#8217;s it. </p>
<p>Here is thus the problem for Professor Krugman and anyone that is trying to correct the errors of Amity&#8217;s ignorance of her subject matter: You are arguing with Sarah Palin, the republican version of the valley girl voicing in a republican <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valspeak">valspeak</a>.  <br />It&#8217;s the republican “brand”.</p>
<p>If there are poster children for the republican <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Stepford_Wives">Stepford Wives </a><br />machine these 2 women are it.  They are manufactured women for a specific male need.   </p>
<p>Don&#8217;t believe me that we are dealing with 2 of the same?  Then listen to the following with your eyes closed and tell me you do not hear Sarah in Amity&#8217;s speech, mind you, with more polish as one would expect from an English major. You do have to get to the points in the programs to where she is feeling comfortable.<br />Like this <a href="http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/9552">presentation with Charlie Rose</a>.  Go to 6:15 and start listening. Let it roll to the end of her answer.</p>
<p>There is <a href="http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/vidLink.php?b=1228482642&#038;e=1228484742&#038;n=1">this one</a> which is what keyed me to this thought for today.  I was eating breakfast yesterday morning with Cspan on.  Catch her as she talks about Krugman at 2:50, but dig her talk regarding Hoover at 6:50.  Can you handle that laissez-faire pronunciation?  Did you catch the &#8220;aught not&#8221;?</p>
<p>Finally, this July 27, 2007 <a href="http://www.fee.org/!UserFiles/events/EAFAmityShlaes.mp3">lecture, Foundation for Economic Education</a>: Manipulating America.  She starts speaking after the intro at 2:40. Listen for about 2 minutes.</p>
<p>Now here is <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/09/03/sarah-palin-rnc-conventio_n_123703.html">Sarah&#8217;s acceptance speech</a>.</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush<br />caution, a long read</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading: Making Government Work by Ernest F. “Fritz” Hollings.  Yes, that Hollings of Gramm and Rudman legislation fame.  It is kind of rambling read, but I now understand why our congress of the democratic party side has been acting like moderate republicans and not liberal or progressive.  I recommend it just as a bit of a fly on the wall experience, be it a southern conservative Democratic fly.  He does not like unions.  He does not like free trade as currently practiced.  </p>
<p>And, as much as he hates unions, he can not see that his fight against GATT and NAFTA in support of the textile industry as jobs moved south and over seas is and was the large version of his attracting jobs from the north east because of the cheap, non-union labor.  He understands the impetus of cheap labor found in Mexico and China for business as a problem of “free trade” for our country as currently practiced, but totally fails to see it in his anti-union position.  He can see the “fight” between nations for capital in flows due to labor cost advantages and how that is harmful to higher developed nations, but Hollings never indicates an understanding that he helped create the game of pitting one area of people against another by bidding down labor when he promoted the south as a union free area.  That is, he sold his state, and thus sold out the northeast and the north midwest auto/rust belt social progress by bidding a lower labor cost.  He fails to see his south played and still plays the roll of China to the unionized areas of America.</p>
<p>I mention this as an introduction to a person mentioned in the book who gave testimony in front of his senate committee hearings on GATT and NAFTA 11/15/94: Sir James Goldsmith.  I present him and this bit of history as a compliment to Stormy&#8217;s postings on trade and the related postings regarding ours and the worlds current economic condition.  Senator Hollings listened, but he did not hear.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Goldsmith">Sir Goldsmith</a> you can imagine, is no small potatoes.  Nor is his background of the character one would expect as to be not so much in favor of GATT and NAFTA.  Consider:<br />
<blockquote>Anglo-French billionare financier<br />The Goldschmidts (family name changed to Goldsmith), like their neighbors and relatives the Rothschilds, had been prosperous merchant bankers in Frankfurt since the 16th century.   <br />He was a greenmail corporate raider and asset stripper. (Including US timber companies.)<br />In 1990, Goldsmith also began a lower-profile, but also profitable, global &#8220;private equity style&#8221; investment operation. By 1994 executives working in his employ in Hong Kong had built a substantial position in the intermediation of global strategic raw-material flows.<br />Goldsmith&#8230; believed Britain had been victim of a socialist conspiracy and that communists had infiltrated the Labour party and the media.</p></blockquote>
<p>So, what are you thinking?  Money and more money, of the world market&#8230;total conservative.  Certainly eccentric, if not a little paranoid regarding the communist bogyman.  Except, he wrote a book in 1993: <a href="http://buzzflash.com/hartmann/05/10/har05010.html">The Trap</a>.<br />From the intro:<br />
<blockquote>We have convinced ourselves that there exists only one valid economic and social model: our own. By attempting to impose it universally, we have exported to almost every corner of the world our diseases: crime, drugs, alcoholism, family breakdown, civil disorder in urban slums, accelerated abuse of the environment and all the other problems that we experience daily.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>But, this is the money quote:<br />
<blockquote>&#8220;The economy is a tool to serve us. It is not a demi-god to be served by society.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>So, with no further ado, I present the Ross Perot of Europe in the epic battle of free trade, <a href="http://www.alanwattsentientsentinel.eu/english/transcripts/Alan_Watt_Blurb_Sir_James_Goldsmith_US_Senate_Speech_Oct192007.html">Sir James Goldsmith</a>: (the audio of the transcript is at the same site)<br />
<blockquote>I believe in free markets, I believe in free enterprise and I believe the purpose of the economy is not just to improve indices but to improve the state of the nation&#8211;yours, mine. So I&#8217;m not an anti-free-market man nor an anti-free-enterprise man; quite the contrary.<br />[regarding a prior witness] What you&#8217;ve heard today is the view from big business, of which I was part. <strong>And I believe the view from society in general is totally different.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Let&#8217;s pause right here and let that statement sink in.  Society has a different view of the effects of “free trade” as practiced.<br />
<blockquote>That&#8217;s nothing to do with productivity, Mr. Chairman; that&#8217;s moving to get the cheap labour forty times cheaper. And please don&#8217;t think this is unskilled jobs; these are skilled jobs; these are high-tech jobs going there. Of course there are also the unskilled jobs, but the skilled ones are going to highly skilled people and they are moving offshore; and if you think that&#8217;s productivity, then I think you would be wrong.</p>
<p>Well, surely the measure of competitiveness is the balance of trade. And as you, Senator, pointed out, if you have the second worst balance of trade in history, 150 billion dollars, that&#8217;s not being competitive in world markets.</p>
<p>In his [prior witness] testimony he talks about 500 billion dollars to be invested in China. And then what does he say? He says what America needs&#8211;and no doubt this is true about Europe as well&#8211;is an increased rate of savings. What for? To invest in China?&#8230;we can&#8217;t increase our rates of savings just to invest them elsewhere and where we bleed to death in terms of capital and we bleed to death in terms of jobs. </p>
<p>And this is the big point, Mr. Chairman. <strong>What we are witnessing is the divorce of the interests of the major corporations and the interests of society as a whole.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>Ok, time out.  I just want to make a plug for my coined bit of nomenclature: United Corporations of Global.  It&#8217;s an entirely new nation that has no grounding to any boundaries of the continents and thus no patriotism to any nation.  Let&#8217;s all chant: UCG, UCG, UCG, UCG&#8230;</p>
<p>Sir James Goldsmith goes on in his opening to present some figures showing the decline to society&#8217;s non-GDP measures since free trade has come on the scene.  So we&#8217;ll skip to the closer quote:<br />
<blockquote>Now I&#8217;m not here as a bleeding heart liberal; I&#8217;m a hard-headed realist and it is my view that <strong>if we try and make profits and at the same time destroy our nations, no one will benefit from it&#8211;even those who make the profits</strong>. <em>(can you say &#8220;2008&#8221;?)</em> </p></blockquote>
<p>Returning to the beginning of this post regarding Senator Hollings lack of connection to his own approach to saving the south, I present this comment made during Sir Goldsmiths testimony:<br />
<blockquote>&#8230;These thinkers were telling us&#8211;in fact I was at [Renaissance] with President Clinton when Michael [Porter] from Harvard was there and he was still lecturing on the comparative advantage, David [Richardo], and I just looked and said, yeah, the comparative advantage, that&#8217;s why BMW&#8217;s come to South Carolina. We have never made an automobile in our history. <strong>I mean, come on, it&#8217;s the wage advantage; 30 dollars in Munich, 15 dollars in Spartanburg</strong>;</p></blockquote>
<p>And that, ladies and gentleman, is the display of the disconnect of our thinkers in Washington concerning all issues.  The disconnect is the segmentation of thought regarding the mechanisms of relationships when forming a position on an issue.  Senator Hollings just laid right out there his selfish thought process.  Now, I don&#8217;t mean this in a derogatory way.  Read his book, you will see he always held in desire what is best for the people.  Unfortunately, the set called “the people” changes with the focus of the argument.  The mechanics of the issue is never seen as being the same at a scale unrelated to the scale of the current set of “the people”.  His desire to help his south (small set of “the people”) made him unable to recognize in his approach to improving the economy of the south, the same mechanical principles he was arguing to prevent in the hearings regarding GATT and NAFTA.  That is the selfishness unrealized by him.  He is anti-union still today.  </p>
<p>Returning to Sir Goldsmith&#8217;s testimony, these are relative to today:<br />
<blockquote>The reason why this time there&#8217;s been a recovery in indices and GNP despite very substantial pressure, downward pressure, on interest rates and facilitating credit through the banking system is because salaries, earnings, have either gone down or risen very little relative to the period of recovery. And that is the whole philosophy, is we can keep inflation down by keeping wages down; <strong>and we have forgotten the purpose of the economy, which is to enrich, to create a stable society, and to include the population, the vast number of people in active life;</strong> and instead we believe that if we can reduce salaries we can keep inflation down. That&#8217;s the wrong way around; we just forgotten what the economy is about, what its purpose is.  <em>(Can you say last 8 years?  Really, though it has been the last 28 years regarding interest rate decline, wage decline, inflation moderation with rising GDP.)</em><br />The alternatives are not just closing the market, becoming protectionist; the alternatives are not saying we are now going into protection and we&#8217;re going to isolate ourselves from the world, each one of them. The alternative is to have regional trading blocs which have similar economies so we&#8217;re not trying to make our labour forces compete with people whose labour costs 2 percent of theirs and thereby destroying them&#8211;but&#8211;and reducing their salaries and eliminating their jobs&#8211;but having negotiated bilateral agreements between trading blocs so that each region, each nation, imports those products that it needs, not those products that destroy its jobs.</p>
<p>Senator, when I was young I was taught, as we all were, that if we managed to create extraordinary material prosperity we would solve our problems. And we were brought up in the belief that there was an inevitability of progress: progress of wealth, progress of stability, progress of civilization. Well during the last fifty years, since I&#8217;ve been more or less an adult, we&#8217;ve had the greatest period of economic prosperity, economic growth in history. We have succeeded beyond our wildest dreams&#8230;And what has happened? Have we solved our problems? Are our towns more stable? Are our families more stable? Is there less crime, less people in prisons? Less people in&#8211;are there more people in permanent and noble employment? What have we done? We have profoundly destabilized our communities. <strong>We have done everything that was wrong in social terms;</strong> we&#8217;ve deracinated, we&#8217;ve uprooted people from the countrysides, we&#8217;ve shoved them into towns, we haven&#8217;t given them jobs; we&#8217;ve created ghettoes and underclasses; we&#8217;ve increased crime and drug addiction and family break-down&#8211;all this in a period of maximum prosperity. Why? Because we were only interested in economic indices. <strong>We forgot that the purpose of the economy is not just to improve the index; it is to improve prosperity along with social stability and social contentment.</strong> And GATT is typical of the economic instrument, whose purpose is to increase corporate profits; whose purpose is to increase gross national activity; and whose result will be the destruction of the stability of our society, a continued break-down in family life, a continued increase in crime, impoverishment and all the other ills that we are now suffering.</p></blockquote>
<p>Read that last part again: <em>&#8230;whose purpose is to increase gross national activity; and whose result will be the destruction of the stability of our society, a continued break-down in family life, a continued increase in crime, impoverishment and all the other ills that we are now suffering.</em></p>
<p>I think Sir Goldsmith was thinking in linear terms as to the increasing negative effects of the form of free trade being set up.  I don&#8217;t think he imagined the deregulation that would give a false sense of reinforcement to the “free trade” weakening of the foundation.  That business was able to shore up the crumbling base via debt against the social decline, just means, as we are now experiencing, that the crumbling of the pyramid will be of a greater energy.  That is assuming we can not shore up the breaking of the foundation such that it is a controlled falling of the pyramid.  Though, if we are lucky (fingers crossed, salt over shoulder) we may just engineer a solid repair of the base before it all falls down.</p>
<p>Can we broaden the discussion now?<br />Thank you.</p>

                                <p>by: Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p><a href="http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/peter-schiff-was-right">Crooks and Liar&#8217;s</a> posted this video, but their presentation seems more from a position of how correct Peter Shiff was.  I think what is more important, and a better lesson to learn is how much crap was being presented by Fox as real, reliable, truthful information that &#8220;you can use&#8221;.  Listen to the other &#8220;panelists&#8221;.  </p>
<p>If we do not learn to understand &#8220;crap&#8221; reporting, if we do not learn to understand story telling for selfish purpose, if we do not learn to understand that propagandizing is not solely a political tool, but more importantly an economic tool, we will not solve our&#8217;s and the worlds current economic condition.</p>
<p>What this video is, is the unvailing of one of the real life experiences of the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120382/plotsummary">Truman show</a> we have been living in since Reagan, only this interpretation of the story used the constructed world of finance on the stage known as the economy.</p>

<p>I guess we can pretend he&#8217;s not a Clinton administration alum.  And he has the right experience:<br />
<blockquote>Though not an economist, Mr. Geithner has a deep understanding of monetary and fiscal policy and broad experience in international trade issues. Before the current crisis, he was involved in the bailouts of Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, Brazil and Thailand.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also continues the tradition of being younger than most of the posters at Angry Bear.</p>
