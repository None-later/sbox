<blockquote><a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/marginalrevolution/feed/~3/VH10JJM1eNs/young-vs-old.html">Young vs. old</a> &#8211; Three of the top five symptoms searched for on Yahoo Mobile in January were early <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/pregnancy/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier">pregnancy</a>, <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/herpes-simplex/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">herpes</a> and <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/aids/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">H.I.V.</a> None of these symptoms showed up among the top searches on desktop computers, which are more likely to be used by older people. The most popular symptom searches on PCs included gastroenteritis, heart attacks, <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/acute-gouty-arthritis/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">gout</a> and <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/herpes-zoster/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">shingles</a>, Yahoo said, adding that the encyclopedic medical symptoms checker on WebMD was the most popular site of its kind among PC users. On WebMD, the top symptoms searched for in January were muscle strain, gastroenteritis and <a href="http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/irritable-bowel-syndrome/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier">irritable bowel syndrome</a>. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/02/technology/as-smartphones-become-health-aids-ads-may-follow.html?hpw">The article</a> in the New York Times is interesting throughout.</p></blockquote>
