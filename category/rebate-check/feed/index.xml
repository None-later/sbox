				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How to use Your IRS Rebate check&#8230;<br />As you may have heard, each of us will be getting <br />a tax rebate check to stimulate the economy.<br />If we spend that money at Wal-Mart, all the money will go to China . <br />If we spend it on gasoline it will go to the Arabs. <br />If we purchase a computer it will go to India  <br />If we purchase fruits and vegetables it will go to Honduras &#038; Guatemala.<br />If we purchase a good car it will go to Japan. <br />If we purchase useless stuff it will also go to China.<br />And none of it will help the American economy.<br />We need to keep that money here in America .<br />The only way to keep that money here at home is to spend it at<br /><strong>Yard Sales </strong>, since those are the only businesses left owned by Americans !!</p>
<p>There is another version suggesting one use it to indulge their risque side.  With that, is there some truth to this suggestion?  Is the spending of the money in some place other than a small business like my flower shop, or a yard sale just making the rebate another channel for  money to move out of the government (us) and into the hands of the few leaving us to also pay the taxes&#8230;some day?</p>
<p>If anything, buying used or at a yard sale will reduce the consumption of more resources.  I mean, I love Craigslist.</p>
