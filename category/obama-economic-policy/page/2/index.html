<blockquote>After the &#8220;first hundred days&#8221; in the term of a new Democratic President comes the next stage; the almost impreceptible transition among his supporters from saying </p>
<p>&#8220;of course, he&#8217;s been hampered by all sorts of obstacles to date, but he&#8217;s about to start delivering on all those promises he made to his supporters on the left&#8221;</p>
<p>to saying</p>
<p>&#8220;well, he never really promised anything and it&#8217;s terribly naive to think he was ever going to deliver anything to his supporters on the left&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently we&#8217;ve <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/12/ten-things-on-which-matt-taibbi-really-does-not-know-what-he-is-talking-about.html">reached it</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s why he gets the big bucks, folks.</p>
<p>Brad DeLong <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/12/ten-things-on-which-matt-taibbi-really-does-not-know-what-he-is-talking-about.html">attempts to attack Matt Taibbi&#8217;s facts</a>. Tao Jonesing replies in comments (DeLong starts; Jonesing in <strong>bold</strong>) :<br />
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>The financial reform bill that just passed the House is not nearly as strong a bill as the Treasury wanted. The reason is not that Obama and Geithner did not push for a stronger bill, but rather that the members of congress balked at a stronger bill. <strong>What financial did Obama and Geithner &#8220;push for,&#8221; exactly? And don&#8217;t point us to speeches. What did they push for, i.e., actually apply the pressure of the bully pulpit? Unless there&#8217;s some way to establish that they brought pressure to bear, I think this fact is an opinion.</strong></p>
</li>
<li>Citigroup did not receive a $306 billion bailout as the first major act of Obama&#8217;s presidency. First, where does the $306 billion number come from? The number I associate with Citigroup is $45 billion of TARP money. Certainly Citigroup would be bust and gone if not for government aid extended to it during George W. Bush&#8217;s presidency&#8211;aid that Obama endorsed&#8211;but it now looks as though Citigroup will pay everything back: that the government will profit from the aid it extended to Citigroup.<strong>Clearly, Taibbi is including the backstop in his number, which you realize in 8.</strong>*
</li>
<li>James P. Rubin is not James S. Rubin.
</li>
<li>The James Rubin whom Mike Froman brought in to staff the economic policy search was not Bob Rubin&#8217;s son. <strong>3-4. Taibbi admits this error.</strong>**
</li>
<li>The Obama economic policy inner circle&#8211;Tim Geithner, Gene Sperling, Larry Summers, Christie Romer, Peter Orszag&#8211;is not &#8220;a group of Wall Street bankers.&#8221; It is only 5% Wall Street banker&#8211;only 1/4 of Larry Summers can possibly count as a Wall Street banker.<strong>You misread what Taibbi said, which was that two people in Obama&#8217;s economic policy inner circle&#8211;Goolsbee and Kornbluh&#8211; were replaced with a group of Wall Stret bankers. Taibbi did not say that the all of the inner circle were Wall Street bankers. So, your fifth &#8220;fact&#8221; is actually a strawman. Perhaps you are focused on the subtitle? I can&#8217;t lay the subtitle at his feet because editorial staff make that decision.</strong> Note from Ken: Brad is incredibly generous in the case of Geithner, whose dinner plans while at the NY Fed were consistently at the homes of Wall Street bankers, and Summers, whose work since attempting to destroy Harvard&#8217;s endowment has been with Goldman, D. E. Shaw, and other paragons of Wall Street.  Summers may have worked for years without being on Wall Street, but it has been his primary source of income since his divorce.
</li>
<li>Mike Froman staffed the economic policy search. Mike Froman&#8211;a very smart and capable man&#8211;did not lead the economic policy search. He was not some corrupt Svengali who foisted advisors who would whisper evil in the innocent Obama&#8217;s ear. Obama led the economic policy search. <strong>Come now, Obama led the search? Really? What did that leadership entail, delegating the day-to-day responsibilities to somebody else? Froman, maybe? Since you seem to know, what did Froman actually do? And Taibbi never said or implied Froman was a corrupt evil Svengali. His point was that Froman was a Citi insider. Overall, this fact seems more like opinion.</strong>
</li>
<li>Austan Goolsbee&#8217;s absence from the transition staff was not notable. Austan Goolsbee does have a senior subcabinet appointment. And Austan Goolsbee is not a voice on the economic left&#8211;this is the man who told the Canadians not to take Barack Obama&#8217;s claims that he wanted to renegotiate NAFTA seriously. I don&#8217;t know the story of Karen Kornbluh.<strong>Your opinion of Goolsbee&#8217;s departure is an opinion, not a fact. I don&#8217;t know whose opinion is correct, although I&#8217;d bet on yours.</strong>
</li>
<li>Ah. Taibbi says: &#8220;the government also agrees to charge taxpayers for up to $277 billion in losses on troubled Citi assets.&#8221; First of all, $277 + $45 = $322, not $306. But a guarantee is not money at risk and money at risk is not money lost. As I said, it looks like the government is going to make money off of its support of Citi. (Albeit not off its support of AIG.) <strong>Clearly, Taibbi is including the backstop in his number, which you realize in 8.</strong>  Note from Ken: This is, by the way, bullshit, since it&#8217;s actually another example of the Rubinesque &#8220;contracts are only valid if they favor Wall Street firms.&#8221; What is being counted as &#8220;profits&#8221; are deeply-discounted equity options that have value because of the mass amount of subsidization and <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/12/charlie-stross-talks-about-liquidity.html">drug money</a> that has gone into the banking system without in the least being passed on to the consumer who is footing the bill.
</li>
<li>Tim Geithner was not hired as Treasury Secretary by Mike Froman. Tim Geithner was hired as Treasury Secretary by Barack Obama. <strong>You are correct that Obama hired Geithner. Nobody else could have, at least in the end. But who proposed Geithner? And what weight did Obama give the opinion of the people who proposed him? Did Obama just rubber stamp the recommendation after meeting Geithner? Who else was on the list? While there&#8217;s no doubt that Taibbi was making a lot of assumptions about Froman&#8217;s role and level of influence to jump to the obviously false conclusion that Froman hired Geithner, the fact that the conclusion was obviously false does not detract from ugly optics that Taibbi was attempting to magnify.</strong>
</li>
<li>According to CBO, the ARRA so far is not worth 640,000 extra jobs as of September 2009 but rather 1.1 million plus or minus 500,000&#8211;and that number will grow.<strong>You got your number from the CBO, but Taibbi says he got his number from the White House. There is a website managed by an executive branch agency that proclaims the 640,329 job number used by Taibbi.</strong></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>So that scores as 5 (or 6, since I&#8217;m inclined to count [2] in the Taibbi column) to 3 (3, 4, and arguably 7) against DeLong, with (8) called a draw (I would give it to Taibbi—the guarantee covers $306B in &#8220;assets&#8221; without cherry-picking, so potential buyers are seeing &#8220;support&#8221;-level offers for the entire $306B.  But there is a specific issue in using the $306B number, and Dr. DeLong correctly notes that the actual backstopping was greater than Taibbi reports. Whether this makes his interpretation here preferable is left as an exercise.)</p>
<p>Hint for the future: if you&#8217;re going to claim you&#8217;ve got fifty corrections, lead with your ten best.</p>
<p>*From the comments later, Our Own Rusty <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/12/ten-things-on-which-matt-taibbi-really-does-not-know-what-he-is-talking-about.html#comment-6a00e551f0800388340120a74cf57b970b">lays out the details</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Wall Street Journal 11/24/2008&#8230;Under the plan, Citigroup and the government have identified a pool of about $306 billion in troubled assets. Citigroup will absorb the first $29 billion in losses in that portfolio. After that, three government agencies &#8212; the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. &#8212; will take on any additional losses, though Citigroup could have to share a small portion of additional losses&#8230;In addition, the Treasury Department also will inject $20 billion of fresh capital into Citigroup. That comes on top of the $25 billion infusion.</p></blockquote>
<p>So it didn&#8217;t happen during Obama&#8217;s presidency, but it did happen post-election, and during the time that the Obama Administration was—by its own declarations—actively holding discussions with the parties.</p>

<p><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Swc-5DBpkII/AAAAAAAAAUY/1qWvhN9Yp00/s1600/largest+employment+losses+YOY+Oct+2009.JPG"><img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Swc-5DBpkII/AAAAAAAAAUY/1qWvhN9Yp00/s400/largest+employment+losses+YOY+Oct+2009.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Apparently, the bursting of the Sunbelt Bubble (building expensive houses in the absence of a water table; what could go wrong?) compares well with destroying unionized automobile production. (Note to Senator Shelby: destroying Detroit didn&#8217;t keep your state from being #10 on the list.)</p>
<p>Also note that #4 on the list is my favorite state for bank failures. (The three states with 20 or more bank failures since Bear Stearns failed are 4th, 9th, and 11th on the list.  The only other state in double-digits right now, Florida, is 16th.)  I&#8217;ll wait patiently for Brad DeLong to explain again how &#8220;<a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/11/the-puzzles-of-american-political-economy-today.html">support of the banking system by the Fed and the Treasury [has] significantly helped the economy</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third and biggest point is that many of those are large states that have leaned Democratic in the past several years. Anyone betting that they—and the next two states, North Carolina and Wisconsin, which both went for Obama in 2008—will be hard-pressed to support Democratic policies twelve months from now without a significant change in the trend.</p>
<p>New Jersey showed you what happens when you run a former Goldman Sachs CEO for Governor right now.  Virginia showed what happens when the base isn&#8217;t motivated. Paul Krugman <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/interest-rates-the-phantom-menace/">makes the point directly</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The longer high unemployment drags on, the greater the odds that crazy people will win big in the midterm elections — dooming us to economic policy failure on a truly grand scale.</p></blockquote>
<p>What are the odds of crazy people winning big?  I&#8217;m not certain, but I make them <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/11/chance-of-great-depression-now-5.html">much better than 20:1</a> based on the current data.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Via <a href="http://economistsview.typepad.com/economistsview/2009/11/links-for-2009-11-20.html">Mark Thoma</a>, Free Exchange, of all places, <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2009/11/a_big_fed_mess.cfm">also sees the danger</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[W]hat is clear is that it does no good for prominent, respected economists to continue heaping praise on a Fed that failed in its mission before the crisis and which [sic] is failing in its mission now.</p>
<p>Because as unpleasant as the prospect of Congressional intervention in monetary policy is, two more years of high unemployment might well lead to far worse.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>Back in 2005, I argued at Old Marginal Utility that &#8220;<a href="http://atbozzo.blogspot.com/2005/03/economic-evaluation-of-alan-greenspan.html">Greenspan exceptionalism</a>&#8221; was not very well founded in that observers rarely engaged in a proper counterfactual analysis of how well Alan Greenspan performed relative to the next best monetary policy technocrat.  That&#8217;s a fairly stringent evaluation criterion, and even Brad DeLong&#8217;s <a href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2005/03/how_good_is_ala.html">glass-half-full response</a> revealed what could be considered major errors in Greenspan&#8217;s judgment.  2009 hindsight of course shows that there was another major error in inflating the housing bubble, failing to recognize it, and allowing his Rand discipleship to overcome common sense in using Fed powers even to skim the froth.</p>
<p>Now some <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/20/business/20bernanke.html?hp">elite opinion</a> favors Ben Bernanke&#8217;s reappointment, but politicians are irritated over Fed stonewalling of bailout oversight and others (e.g. <a href="http://www.prospect.org/csnc/blogs/beat_the_press_archive?month=08&#038;year=2009&#038;base_name=marketplace_radio_skips_the_bu">Dean Baker</a>) point out that Ben Bernanke who put the Fed throttles to the firewall to save the world is also the Ben Bernanke who carried over Greenspan policy until it was too late among other things.</p>
<p>So what should the counterfactual-based evaluation of Bernanke say?  What would the hypothetical panel of smart graduate students have done?  It seems even harder to suggest that Bernanke was essential than Greenspan — in this case, because well-read economists should have had it from Ben Bernanke the academician that in a depression-level crisis you don&#8217;t skimp on the monetary policy intervention.  Meanwhile, Bernanke gets no points for prescient instincts as the save-the-world interventions have seemed to be firmly of the close-the-barn-doors-after-the-horses-have-bolted variety.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, significant elements like the opaque lending programs have the appearance if not reality of being in part the predator state (a la <a href="http://http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/08/11/what_is_the_predator_state/">Jamie Galbraith</a>) in action.  There&#8217;s a line of &#8216;b-b-but Bernanke and Paulson saved the world&#8217; opinion along the lines of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/18/business/18nocera.html?_r=1">this bit of fail</a> from the often incisive Joe Nocera:<br />
<blockquote>So why the anger? Why the suggestions of “cover-up” and “lies”? On Thursday, as I watched Mr. Paulson being castigated, it dawned on me. Seven months later, with the palpable fear of a financial collapse largely subsided, it really all boils down to how you view what happened last year. Was it, as Mr. Towns believes, a bailout of a handful of unworthy but too-big-to-fail institutions? Or was it, in the eyes of Mr. Paulson, a rescue of a teetering financial system? My vote is for the latter.</p></blockquote>
<p>To which the obvious response is, duh, who says it has to be one or the other?  A reality-based critique of the bailouts allows them to be both effective at saving the world <em>and</em> unconscionable screw-jobs that kept an array of bad actors from paying for their greed and incompetence.  (The latter clearly feeds a lot of the underlying sentiment of the tea partiers, even if it&#8217;s ultimately the greedy and incompetent who are marshalling it.)  However, considering Team Obama&#8217;s political tone-deafness, it&#8217;ll be a pleasant but major surprise if they <s>don&#8217;t</s> let Bernanke go back to Princeton for some R&#038;R.</p>

<blockquote>Barack Obama tells us we should not investigate American intelligence agents or their overlings who are responsible for torturing hundreds of suspects in their custody. We have to forget about the past, he says, to concentrate our attention on the future. That might be a convincing argument if Obama were going all out for an ambitious program to remake our economy and our relationship to the rest of the world. But the future is on hold because the number one job today is bailing out the financial system, so we can preserve the money moguls who juiced our economy in the past.</p></blockquote>

                                <p>Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been hearing about various potential schemes to game the PPIP, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jeffrey-sachs/the-geithner-summers-plan_b_183499.html">Jeffrey Sachs gets in on the action</a> with a pure self-dealing scenario (via <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Americablog/~3/ZGz5YPnq-yg/is-geithner-summers-plan-even-worse.html">Americablog</a>):<br />
<blockquote>Here&#8217;s how. Consider a toxic asset held by Citibank with a face value of $1 million, but with zero probability of any payout and therefore with a zero market value. An outside bidder would not pay anything for such an asset. All of the previous articles consider the case of true outside bidders.</p>
<p>Suppose, however, that Citibank itself sets up a Citibank Public-Private Investment Fund (CPPIF) under the Geithner-Summers plan. The CPPIF will bid the full face value of $1 million for the worthless asset, because it can borrow $850K from the FDIC, and get $75K from the Treasury, to make the purchase! Citibank will only have to put in $75K of the total.</p></blockquote>
<p>Did Sachs read the PPIP Legacy Securities <a href="http://www.treas.gov/press/releases/reports/legacy_securities_terms.pdf">term sheet</a> [PDF] before writing that?  [Though see the addendum below.]  That sort of transaction appears to be forbidden under the &#8216;Governance and Management&#8217; section of the summary terms:<br />
<blockquote>A Fund Manager may not, directly or indirectly, acquire Eligible Assets from or sell Eligible Assets to its affiliates, any other Fund or any private investor that has committed 10% or more of the aggregate private capital raised by the Fund.  Private investors may not be informed of potential acquisitions of specific Eligible Assets prior to acquisition. </p></blockquote>
<p>Geithner and Summers may or not be the poster children for &#8216;regulatory capture,&#8217; but they&#8217;re not stupid.  (For that matter, Sachs&#8217;s scenario presumes that only Citi can detect the underlying worthlessness of the asset, so FDIC will permit the maximum leverage under the program.)</p>
<p>There are also some more complicated scenarios that use secret deals and kickback schemes to get around the anti-self-dealing provisions of the PPIP.  For now, I would judge those to represent descriptions of serious frauds rather characterizations of actual PPIP loopholes.  Such time as Treasury (or DOJ) is caught playing see-no-evil with those, then there may be something more than an attempt to pile on.</p>
<p>This is not at all to say that there are not serious and valid concerns regarding PPIP design.  Among other things, I&#8217;d be much happier if I saw the likes of <a href="http://www.bepress.com/ev/vol5/iss5/art5/">Larry Ausubel and Peter Cramton</a> hired to ensure that the private managers effectively compete for the public subsidies and do not overpay relative to some reasonable assessment of fundamental (not necessarily &#8216;market&#8217;) asset values.</p>
<p>Added: The anti-self-dealing terms from the Legacy Securities program, quoted above, are from a 4/6 revision of the term sheet (thanks to KHarris for pointing that out) and may have crossed paths with Sachs&#8217;s article (also of 4/6); they&#8217;re a little different from the Legacy Loans terms sheet where a prohibition on self-dealing has been a feature all the time.  Here&#8217;s the original (and apparently current) language for the <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/press/releases/reports/legacy_loans_terms.pdf">Legacy Loans sheet</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Private Investors may not participate in any PPIF that purchases assets from sellers that are affiliates of such investors or that represent 10% or more of the aggregate private capital in the PPIF.  </p></blockquote>
<p>It would take a lawyer to determine how this compares to the Legacy Securities terms.  The ban on communication prior to asset sales looks new and makes it clear that schemes to coordinate Legacy Securities sales with purchasers are improper.</p>
<p>An issue with many of these critiques is that they seem to combine elements of the two programs.  Sachs&#8217;s example is based on leverage ratios allowed under the Legacy Loans program but not Legacy Securities, in which case other Legacy Loans program terms should apply.</p>

                                <p>Suppose I told you that there was a crisis with a stock, say, GE.  That the price of the stock had dropped <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/bc?s=GE&#038;t=1y&#038;l=on&#038;z=m&#038;q=l&#038;c=">around 75% in the past year</a>.  And you responded, &#8220;But the problem is solved; the prices of long-term Call Options (say, <a target="_blank" href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q/op?s=GE&#038;m=2011-01">the January 2011 20s</a>) has gone up, as has their Open Interest.</p>
<p>You will (rightly) point out that this won&#8217;t revitalise the assets themselves and I will (rightly) note that option markets rather saved the equity markets in 1987, for instance.  You will note that I am too optimistic, and I will agree, holding up a <a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/03/tim-geithner-is-not-a-tool-of-wall-street.html">Brad</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://delong.typepad.com/sdj/2009/03/matthew-richardson-and-nouriel-roubini.html">DeLong</a> mask (since I&#8217;d rather have DeLong&#8217;s [relative to mine] abundant hair than Geithner&#8217;s abundant forehead).</p>
<p>Then I will drop the other shoe and say that the toxic (&#8220;legacy&#8221;) assets should be priced as if the Fed-supported trades were options, with the underlying current price worked out by Black-Scholes. (As I&#8217;ve noted before, B-S is specifically <strong>IN</strong>appropriate for this exercise, as it will overvalue the option. And therefore anyone suggesting the toxic [&#8220;legacy&#8221;] assets should be priced—or carried on their books—at a level higher than that model will clearly be insane.)</p>
<p>Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to The TARP Solution.  Details beneath the fold.</p>
<p>TARP is the Treasury Department&#8217;s attempt to confront two realities: (1) it isn&#8217;t a &#8220;market&#8221; in any reasonable sense of the word if the Fed is putting up 85% of the cash. (People who tell us that this means firms are committing a &#8220;large amount&#8221; to the process either do not understand the English language,or are <a target="_blank" href="http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2009/04/little-bit-of-careful-thinking-and-why.html">hedge fund managers trying to sell something</a>.)  So let&#8217;s put some random numbers together.</p>
<p>Those &#8220;legacy&#8221; assets are trading in the market around 30.  The Big C and others are carrying them on their books around 80.  Several people who should know better (Summers, Geithner, DeLong) have conflated &#8220;the market is underpricing the assets&#8221; with &#8220;the true price of the assets will make the banks solvent again.&#8221;*</p>
<p>So we know three things.  (1) People are willing to pay 30% of their own money to buy these assets, (2) the Fed is only requiring them to pay 15%, and (3) the fair value is between 30 (the current market price) and 80, and probably closer to the former than the later.</p>
<p>So again, using back-of-the-envelope principles, let&#8217;s pretend that we think the recovery will be soon, that the defaults will slow (or at least that resales will be quick and frictionless), and that the market reaches that consensus quickly.  And so fair value should be around 50.**</p>
<p>So let&#8217;s say the Fed offers to buy a MBS for 50.  How, as an investor, do I make money off this?  Three possible ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>If I own securities for which I paid </li>
<li>If I own securities for which I paid >50, and which I cannot sell for 50 without revealing myself to be insolvent, I buy securities at 50 along with the Fed and &#8220;average in.&#8221;  (This is the &#8220;how to stay solvent longer than the market can be rational&#8221; act.)</li>
<li>If the Fed is buying securities at 50 so that I can no longer buy them at 30—I buy a LONG-dated Call Option on the security.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is that last that explains TARP. Effectively, the co-investors with the Fed will be buying a Call option at 7.5 on the security at 50.***</p>
<p>Of course, it may not be an at-the-money Call option.  More likely, the hedge fund effectively will be buying an out-of-the-money option (say, a 49.5 Call for 8) where some portion of the purchase is put up by the government.</p>
<p>Now you will note that, technically, TARP requires the hedge fund to buy the asset.  So you might argue that this is not an option.  But let&#8217;s look at the generic payoff diagram to the hedge fund of the two scenarios.
<p><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Sdlq9tDeBdI/AAAAAAAAARY/L5WRVc8T6Xw/s1600-h/tarp+v+call.JPG"><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_wM5Pj6NF0jA/Sdlq9tDeBdI/AAAAAAAAARY/L5WRVc8T6Xw/s400/tarp+v+call.JPG" border="0" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Amazingly, you can&#8217;t tell the difference on the payoff diagram as the security gains.****  In both cases, the hedge fund manager has just gone long volatility.</p>
<p>Expect that to have a ripple effect—I&#8217;m guessing dampening, cet. par.—on other option volatility trades.</p>
<p>All that is left is to back out what actual value of the security was assumed by the hedge fund when they bought the option.  Which I will also leave as an exercise to the reader, while suggesting that a fair indication is min[x, TotalFedContribution] s.t. x a.s. approaches TotalFedContribution.</p>
<p>Will this bring the markets back, or make bank balance sheets more stable? I&#8217;m still saying &#8220;No,&#8221; and hoping to be proved wrong.</p>
<p>But what it should do is reduce volatility buying, especially in the other debt markets, for the foreseeable future.  So if any of those <s>Bankrupt</s> &#8220;legacy asset constrained&#8221; institutions has a long volatility position, there will be even more &#8220;Unintended Consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>*In fairness to Brad DeLong, I don&#8217;t believe he believes this. As <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eschatonblog.com/2009/03/politics-is-weird.html">Dr. Black noted</a>, George Voinovich &#8220;wants to see a pile of money in flames before he&#8217;s willing to vote for what&#8217;s necessary,&#8221; and DeLong therefore sees this as a necessary evil.  Having seen no evidence from the Obama Administration that they Have a Clue, I am naturally suspicious that this particular idiocy will do anything other than waste time and money—both of which are in increasingly short supply—but, since Larry Summers has shown <a target="_blank" href="http://thismodernworld.com/4731">his brilliant foresight before</a> and clear has <a target="_blank" href="http://thismodernworld.com/4736">no skin in the game</a>, I am reassured that there is no Principal-Agent problem at work here, as they was when Christopher &#8220;I never saw a regulation I like&#8221; Cox was named head of the SEC by the Previous Administration.</p>
<p>**While we&#8217;re at it, can we pretend that <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-url/ref=ntt_athr_dp_sr_1?_encoding=UTF8&#038;search-type=ss&#038;index=books&#038;field-author=Amber%20Benson">Amber Benson</a> will be my next wife, which is probably very little less likely than those other possibilities (especially since I&#8217;m already married to an sf-writing actress/director)?  (Amazingly, even without those conditions, we would be using a BotE number of 50: though there is a legitimate argument that 60 would be easier to work with, I&#8217;m assuming no one is that stupid.)</p>
<p>***This is why 60 would have been easier; 15% of 60 is 9, so I wouldn&#8217;t have to pay attention to decimal places.  40 would also have been easier—and both certainly more realistic than 60 and arguably more realistic than 50, but I want to maintain the pretense of the U.S. Treasury that this is a liquidity, not a solvency, crisis.  (They&#8217;re wrong, but it&#8217;s their game.)</p>
<p>****The reason we can tell the difference on the losses is the possibility that the hedge fund treats the position as if it were an in-the-money Call option for which the Fed paid the in-the-money portion; the real returns to the hedge fund of the position in a TARP security are the same in both cases; there would be differences in the way the rest of the portfolio was managed, though, which are left as an exercise to the reader.</p>

                                <p>By Divorced one like Bush</p>
<p>This past weekend <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/what-about-occ-ruling.html">I wrote about the OCC</a>, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and 4 rulings that this office has made over the last two presidencies.  <br />1. Preventing state AG&#8217;s and the state banking departments from investigating and regulating national banks.  2004.<br />2. Allowing Banks to become real estate developers and managers to including wind mill operations. 2006<br />3.  Asserting that credit card insurance via telemarketing was not insurance and thus again immune from state AG&#8217;s and the state insurance departments. 2002  This particular ruling being the result of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.  The act that is now pegged as THE deregulating action of the current economic mess. <br />4.  Allowing banks to sell insurance. 1996.</p>
<p>All four are clearly rulings that can have lines drawn directly to the what we are hearing today as to why the alphabet soup of “financial products” created by “to big to fail” entities have required a combination of delivering funds and pledging funds to the tune of around $9.5 trillion dollars.  I googled the current number and could only find numbers dating from December 2008 such as this site suggesting then the <a href="http://www.geldpress.com/2008/12/bailout-cost-85-trillion/">total was $8.5 trillion.</a></p>
<p>We really need to start talking about the OCC.  It is a player, if not <em>the</em> behind the scene player of a lot of what has become our financial system.  Note, I did not say banking system.  That is key.</p>
<p>Ok, yesterday it was proposed that as part of the solution, our Treasury head needs some new power.  Already <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20090324-716886.html">leadership is say &#8220;Yes&#8221;.</a></p>
<p>This call for power with an already announced “Yes” immediately sets off my suspicion meter.  After 8 years of power being concentrated into the hands of the one (Homeland Security), unitary executive powers still being exercised by Obama, lobbyist run wild, departments turned from working for the people to working for the industry (see labor, FDA, military), no bid contracts and their results, <a href="http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0821-01.htm">$9 billion </a>in bundled crisp new hundred dollar bills missing in Iraq, Paulson asking for $750 billion, not strings attached (add yours here)&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME!</strong>  <br />You want to give the power to say &#8220;yeh&#8221; or &#8220;nay&#8221; on a financial institution to one person?  Have we not learned?</p>
<p>Then it dawned on me.  Think about the 1996 OCC ruling and the 2002.  Think about the praise for the FDIC and the job it has been doing.  Here is an entire entity congress created to take care of failed banks.  Ah, you say entities like AIG are not banks, so there is no jurisdiction.  At least that is what we are being told.  However, being that the OCC has in it&#8217;s rulings merged the banking, real estate and insurance industries (specifically ruling what was and was not insurance) I will not accept that all those smart lawyers in congress and the one that heads the White House would not be able to produce a winning argument that by the actions of the OCC rulings, the FDIC already has the authority to do to AIG what it has currently been doing.</p>
<p>That lead me to look at the FDIC web site.  In particular, it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/about/index.html">“About”</a> page:<br />
<blockquote>Mission<br />The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is an independent agency created by the Congress that maintains the stability and public confidence in the nation’s <strong>financial system</strong> by insuring deposits, <strong>examining and supervising financial institutions, and <em>managing receiverships</em></strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>It does not say “banks”.  It says “financial systems” and “managing receiverships”.  </p>
<p>Not enough for you.  Consider there was an <a href="http://www.fdic.gov/about/learn/advisorycommittee/charter.html">advisory committee</a> created in 2002 by the then Chair Donald Powell.<br />
<blockquote>Scope and Objectives: The Committee will provide advice and recommendations on a broad range of issues relating to the FDIC&#8217;s mission and activities, including, but not limited to: the delivery of services by the FDIC, its corporate infrastructure, and policy initiatives in the areas of deposit insurance, <strong>supervision of financial institutions, resolutions and management of failing and failed institutions, and other issues impacting the financial services industry</strong>.</p></blockquote>
<p>It did not say “banking” or “banks” here either.  And it specifically talks about exactly what we have here today: failed and failing institution.  You can not get away from the all inclusive “financial services industry”.  </p>
<p>Want more?  Consider the bio of the current chair:<br />
<blockquote>Before her appointment to the FDIC, Ms. Bair was the Dean&#8217;s Professor of Financial Regulatory Policy for the Isenberg School of Management at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst since 2002.</p></blockquote>
<p>The FDIC is already the entity with the power that Obama is now requesting for his surrogate.  On the plus side in my book, it is an agency created from the destruction of the last time we were here.  It is a New Deal institution and that makes it clean in my mind (at least cleaner than more recently created entities).  So, even if I&#8217;m wrong, and I don&#8217;t think I am because this nation for 13 years now has been blurring the line between banks, insurance and recently real estate to the point that it is one big industry and that counts when you go in front of a judge, the correct request that we should have been hearing from Obama is to expand the definition of banking to clarify all these new mongrel banking entities such that the entity this nation created specifically to do what the Treasury is asking for can do the job without question of jurisdiction.

                                <p>Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>In this round-up of &#8220;experts&#8221; (Cramer?!) on whether to &#8220;<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/06/AR2009030602955.html">soak the Rich</a>&#8221; at the WaPo (the title of which, given the actual Obama budget plans, reminds one that mainstream discourse has really lost sight of the true rich-soaking possibilities), what really bugged me was this from Laura D&#8217;Andrea Tyson selling spending restraint in the Obama budget:<br />
<blockquote>It is a shibboleth among critics that President Obama&#8217;s budget relies almost exclusively on tax increases on the wealthy to fund increases in government spending, yet this not an accurate representation of the facts&#8230;</p>
<p>It reduces non-defense discretionary spending to 3.6 percent of GDP, compared with an average of 3.8 percent between 1969 and 2008. [emphasis added]</p></blockquote>
<p>This begs the question of why the level of non-defense discretionary spending from an era of mostly Republican presidents and lately Republican Congresses should be considered adequate.  Indeed, there seem to be more <a href="http://www.asce.org/reportcard/2009/">public investment funding shortfalls</a> than funds so far committed to them.</p>
<p>Now a clever and socially useful direction signaled in the stimulus package is to address transition problems upfront for, e.g., sensible climate policy so the future implicit or explicit taxes aren&#8217;t seen as quite so much of a hold-up for those unfortunate enough to have taken extra advantage of the legacy policy of free emissions.  Properly executed, that can help keep the well-intentioned but wobbly on board with programs that need all the support that can be mustered to overcome entrenched interests.  The risk is getting no more than the appearance of transformation, which would represent at a minimum a lost opportunity — especially given that it may be dawning on the public that not everything in the U.S. is optimally arranged.</p>
<p>Perhaps some of the administration&#8217;s policies can be implemented as tax expenditures to direct private-sector activity in accordance with public policy, and I suppose (but don&#8217;t know) that might not be included in the 3.6 percent.  Some areas may be so starved for funding that they&#8217;re regarded as hard to get off the ground quickly, though that&#8217;s not so much of an issue over the longer planning horizons of the regular budget.  It seems unavoidable that seriously unscrewing up the transportation and energy networks, the publicly-funded education system, and so on will at some point require some serious funding beyond the couple percent of GDP of extra stimulus spending.  The administration might as well figure out what they really want and make a case for it, since as we&#8217;ve seen from the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/03/on-economic-advice-john-mccain-is.html">Kevin Hassetts</a> among other right-wing, uh, luminaries, they&#8217;re going to be tarred as dirty commies by the right whatever they do.</p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>Much like the largely if not totally hypothetical family farm that might need to be sold off to cruel agribusiness to pay &#8220;death taxes,&#8221; I suspect that trotting out charities as the Real Victims of Obama administration plans to reduce tax expenditures on the wealthy is the latest Luntzian effort to put a plausibly human face on the upward-redistribution beast.  The combination of income- and estate-tax policies makes the net direction of the incentives for tax-deductible giving ambiguous, and a kicker is an observation well-buried in an <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/27/us/27charity.html">NYT article</a> on the subject from last week:<br />
<blockquote>Robert F. Sharpe Jr., a fund-raising expert in Memphis, said many of the wealthiest donors are already limited to deductions of 28 percent for their charitable gifts because they are subject to the alternative minimum tax.</p></blockquote>
<p>A more correct modifier on &#8220;donors&#8221; in this case might be &#8220;wealthier&#8221; as the AMT hits in something of a reverse donut hole pattern, where the highest-income taxpayers tend fall out of the AMT system because they have sufficient tax liabilities at the top statutory rates for the ordinary income tax.</p>
<p>So the vast majority of taxpayers — Obama&#8217;s 95 percent — don&#8217;t make enough money to face more than a 28 percent Federal income tax rate on their last dollar of income.  Of the remaining 5 percent, many pay the AMT and the tax price of their contributions is based on a tax rate no higher than the AMT&#8217;s 28 percent top rate.  So we&#8217;re really talking about the very small slice of the very fortunate who pay the top regular income tax rates and are outside the AMT system: generally, the tip-top of the income distribution and their beneficiaries.</p>
<p>Of course the NYT has a role as a house organ of the upper class (at least the portion for whom the role is not taken by the W$J), but this is an example of what Jonathan Chait very nicely described as the systematic <a href="http://blogs.tnr.com/tnr/blogs/the_plank/archive/2009/03/03/wealthy-idiots-meet-idiot-reporter.aspx">blowing out of proportion</a> of the tax concerns of the very rich.</p>
<p>A little more is below the fold.</p>
<p>The dirty secret of tax-deductible contributions is that it amounts to spending lots of public money on projects that have some combination of  dubious value to secular society and alternative means for public and private funding.  A <a href="http://www.cbo.gov/doc.cfm?index=4012&#038;type=0">now-aged CBO study</a> describes the disposition of tax-deductible contributions, and nobody should be surprised that the biggest beneficiary group is religious institutions.  Religion is dependent on voluntary contributions, but are not so exposed to wealthy individual donors.  Arts, education, health, and social services groups tend to have significant other sources of revenue — tuition, other fees for services, grants.  (Arts groups are notably exposed to corporate donations, and many have been slammed as their benefactors have circled the wagons.)</p>
<p>Now there&#8217;s some <a href="http://www.philanthropy.iupui.edu/workingpapers/brooks%202007%20income%20tax%20policy%20Jrnl%20Policy%20Analysis.pdf">evidence</a> [PDF] out there that the tax-price elasticity of donations is greater (in absolute value) than 1 for some of the major categories of donations, which implies that the tax deduction elicits more donations than the tax cost.  Otherwise, Establishment Clause issues aside, the government could rescind the tax deduction and make the charitable groups whole (at least as a group) through some system of grants.</p>
<p>Even this sort of Hicks-Pareto efficiency doesn&#8217;t establish that the funds are being put to their highest-valued use, though.  A lot of donations make rich institutions richer, and diminishing marginal productivities and utilities would lead you to conclude that those institutions can run out of useful things to spend money on and thus are pushed into activities of dubious social utility like, uhm, making themselves into tax-free hedge funds with educational side projects.  So I&#8217;m in favor of giving a pretty hard look at the tax status of endowments too.</p>
