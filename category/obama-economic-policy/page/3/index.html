<p>John &#8220;<a href="http://erin-obrien.blogspot.com/2009/02/shocking-admission.html">Don&#8217;t Say</a>&#8221; Boehner <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/26/us/politics/26budget.html?_r=1&#038;hp=&#038;pagewanted=all">makes (or should make) Greg Mankiw cry</a>:<br />
<blockquote>Mr. Boehner likewise criticized Mr. Obama’s cap-and-trade emissions permits proposal, saying, “Cap-and-trade is code for increasing taxes and killing American jobs, and that’s the last thing we need to do during these troubled economic times.”</p></blockquote>
<p>As the NYT reports, the Obama budget actually would (mostly) rebate the proceeds of selling the credits via the &#8216;Making Work Pay&#8217; credit, so Boehner is (mostly) lying about the tax increase part of the proposal.  The administration should be concerned that the implicit tax will be passed on for fairness and political reasons, and a conceptually good way to deal with that is to make people approximately whole in a way that doesn&#8217;t take away the price signal to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<p>As for the job-killing business, I&#8217;d like to see any other job that Boehner would save in the name of inefficiency; jobs whose existence depends on free carbon emissions are being subsidized by the rest of society.  Of course it&#8217;s the net job creation or destruction that really matters.  Insofar as there&#8217;s not much net tax increase, usual arguments regarding incentive distortion of taxes don&#8217;t really apply, and the net proceeds would go to low-carbon energy infrastructure and R&#038;D that would be reasonably calculated to have substantial long-range returns, the job-killing claim looks histrionic.  But if you don&#8217;t have ideas, then I suppose there&#8217;s not much to do but try to pound the table.</p>

<p>Reader Roger Senserrich listened to the Obama reply that also caught <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/CalculatedRisk/~3/UQhzy0nhDR0/obama-on-nationalization.html">CR&#8217;s</a> eye and sends a relatively favorable (to the administration) interpretation:<br />
<blockquote>Let´s see if it makes sense.</p>
<p>1. Obama says that America doesn´t nationalize; it is not something we do. That´s actually false; ask IndyMac or WaMu shareholders on what hit them. The FDIC does nationalize.<br />2. The political system, however, does not perceive it as the &#8220;N&#8221; word. There was little backlash against those actions, as the FDIC is seen as non-political; some sort of a technocratic guardian that does what is needed.<br />3. Enter the stress test: Geithner talks about testing the banks to see if they can swim in these troubled waters. Only some banks; the 14 with assets over 100 billion, will take this wonderful &#8220;test&#8221;. Depending on how well they fare, they will get more or less capital, and the treasury will grab more or less stock.</p>
<p>See where am I going? The administration could be looking for a way to benchmark and nationalize what is needed using a technocratic procedure with a clear way out, as a way of doing the work with some political cover. Essentially, the idea is to get the &#8220;N&#8221; word out of the debate, and make it about banks getting &#8220;intervined&#8221; after failing to comply with the &#8220;agency&#8221;´s regulations.</p>
<p>It is convoluted, and I might be looking for a rationale that is not actually there, but it makes sense; it gives them a way to do what is needed without actually having to name it. Nationalization might be economically necessary, but is not politically feasible; this could be a way to create political cover for it.</p></blockquote>
<p>Tom here. For another sympathetic view, see <a href="http://content.ksg.harvard.edu/blog/jeff_frankels_weblog/">Jeff Frankel</a>.  I read Obama&#8217;s statement through the filter that Obama is a smart lawyer and note that he&#8217;s foreclosed nothing going forward; the money quote in my view is that what we&#8217;ve seen so far represents &#8220;some of the tough love that&#8217;s going to be necessary.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now Geithner and Summers could yet find their pictures attached to the Wikipedia entry on regulatory capture, but we also need to avoid reacting as if we&#8217;ve been <a href="http://www.pynchon.net/Gravitys_Rainbow_Reference/part_1_beyond_the_zero.aspx">overconditioned</a> to eight years of life under <a href="http://d-squareddigest.blogspot.com/2003/02/and-another-hit-and-run-i-find-myself.html">Davies&#8217; Law</a>.  This is not to counsel against vigilance with respect to the administration&#8217;s deeds so much as to suggest a la Frankel that the &#8220;they have no clue and the Obama presidency has already failed&#8221; reactions are at least premature.</p>
<p>The political issue is not irrelevant.  Policies that don&#8217;t need to go through Congress would appear to operate under the constraint that it has to be able to be done with $350B in TARP Part II funds, the exercise of various Fed powers in coordination with Treasury, and whatever TARP Part I funds get paid back by institutions who think they can live without help from a Treasury less pliant than Paulson&#8217;s.  Those resources are substantial but not unlimited.  A program that requires more than that needs to deal with the likelihood of opposition from most of the Party of No&#8217;s representation plus other politicians capable of detecting that another dip into public funds for the financial services industry, however necessary, is likely to rival plague for popularity.  At least as frightening as the problem that the <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/NakedCapitalism/~3/LpVDTgBsbIo/bank-stress-testing-less-than-meets-eye.html">&#8220;stress test&#8221; is window dressing</a> is the likely size of the caucus who&#8217;d vote against an expanded bailout were the evidence of necessity delivered by the ghost of Ayn Rand herself.  In fact, I&#8217;d say that right now there&#8217;s no way a bailout expansion would pass.</p>
<p>That seems to put a premium on cleverly engineering a plan to the aforementioned resources.  That may be observationally indistinguishable from a lack of boldness.</p>

                                <p>by divorced one like Bush<br />Updated comment at end</p>
<p>So, now that the Democratic Party has the majority and the White House, why am I not hearing about the use of the Nuclear Option?  I mean, it occurred to me that if there was a way to end the partisan old ways, the Nuclear Option is it.  It sure worked well for the Bush administration.  You need 60 votes?  Bring in the non-executive executive senate menber: Biden.  Oh, you think there needs to be a tie to be broken before our hatchet man can be used?  Well I have news for you.  Being that everything comes down to breaking the 60 vote line to get anything done, by precedent of calling for a record number of filibusters the Republicans have set the new definition of a tie: 59/41.  Biden makes it 60/41.</p>
<p>This gets me to the trust issue and I&#8217;m going to toot my own horn here for those who think human capital is bunk regarding getting us out of this mess. (Did I mention the flower shop was off 13% for Christmas and 45% for January?  Yeah, I got skin in this game.)  </p>
<p>Seems on the same day I posted my message to the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/02/attention-republicansblue-dog.html">Republicans and the Blue Dogs</a>, a man officially of the economic science posted on the same subject (via C &#038; L via Naked Capitalism).<br /><a href="http://blogs.ft.com/maverecon/2009/02/fiscal-expansions-in-submerging-markets-the-case-of-the-usa-and-the-uk/#more-428">Willem Buiter</a>.</p>
<p>Here is what I said:<br />
<blockquote>The greatest harm that is coming from the republican&#8217;s drive to instill their minority will on the many out of selfish want, is to further the demise of the people&#8217;s trust. For the blue dogs it is their ignorance of their economic ideology that creates the mistrust. The republicans/blue dogs, and those helping them by lending their &#8220;professionalism&#8221;, think they are only effecting a political strategy. In truth, they are destroying the very basis for the wealth they desire. Their entire campaign for decades to discredit, to instill mistrust in the primary institution we have, the US (We the People) government, has been the primary cause to our economic decline. To increase the level of distrust is to decrease the available “intangible capital” which is 77% of our wealth generating power.</p></blockquote>
<p>  Here is Willem Buiter:<br />
<blockquote>As part of this widespread erosion of social capital, both citizens and markets lost faith in the ability of governments to commit themselves to any future course of action that was not validated, at each future point in time, as the most opportunistic course of action at that future point in time &#8211; what macroeconomists call time-consistent policies and game theorists call ’subgame-perfect’ strategies.</p>
<p>This morality tale has important consequences for a government’s ability to conduct effective countercyclical policy.  For a fiscal stimulus (current tax cut or public spending increase) to boost demand, it is necessary that the markets and the public at large believe that sooner or later, measures will be taken to reverse the tax cut or spending increase in present value terms.  If markets and the public at large no longer believe that the authorities will assure fiscal sustainability by raising future taxes or cutting future public expenditure by the necessary amounts, they will conclude that the government plans either to permanently monetize the increased amounts of public debt resulting from the fiscal stimulus, or that it will default on its debt obligations. </p></blockquote>
<p>Mr. Buiter is prescribing a different solution to the lack of trust than what I&#8217;m going to suggest.  He thinks more money to the banks is needed to promote lending.  Well, isn&#8217;t that kind of giving to those you know you can not trust, not to mention just adding to the debt that he notes no one seems to want to consider?  He did state the following as part of his “morality tale”: <br />
<blockquote>During the decade leading up to the crisis, current account deficits increased steadily and became unsustainable.  Strong domestic investment (much of it in unproductive residential construction) outstripped domestic saving. Government budget discipline dissipated; fiscal policy became pro-cyclical.  Financial regulation and supervision was weak to non-existent, <strong>encouraging credit</strong> and asset price booms and bubbles.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hope was the word.  Trust is the need.  I&#8217;ve seen and lived what the Republicans and Blue Dogs can do.  I&#8217;m willing to take a chance for the benefit of building future trust, thus building with the 77% of our power, thus nurturing hope, and let Obama send in Biden to the Senate.  Hell, maybe it&#8217;s time they come up with the unitary vice executive theory and take it for a spin in the Senate!   In-other-words, my solution is for Obama et al to just take god damn control and do what they want, then we&#8217;ll have something to compare to along with &#8220;Republican brand&#8221; bipartisanship. We can decide come November 2012 how the brands compare. (Catch that “bringing business to governance” lingo of how to speak civics?)  </p>
<p>We survived the last 4 years, we know where we&#8217;ll be if we keep going as we are (no thanks to our free press), so I say let the Dem&#8217;s pull a republican move: redefine what a tie is, have the Obama&#8217;s legal council write up the unitary vice executive theory and send in Biden to the Senate.</p>
<p>I trust that it will not be worse than what we have now.  And that, &#8220;my friends&#8221; is using our fullest economic power.<br />Almost forgot: Can we please <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/09/can-we-please-broaden-our-thinking-in.html">broaden the discussion now</a>?</p>
<p>Update: Two commentors noted that the tie break may not work as I suggested.  RonE notes there is no need for the 60, just change the rules to a simple majority.  TStockmann notes that we would not get all the Dem&#8217;s to go along.  I assumed the Dems would act tribal if they had someone to lead them, that is what is needed when you are fighting another tribe  You can&#8217;t beat the other tribe by acting all independent thinking virtuous as to the ideal bipartisanship.</p>
<p>But here is where my plan works.   We&#8217;re going to have the unitary vice executive who is president of the Senate just as soon as Obama has his attorney write it up.  Or, maybe Biden should just have his attorney write it up ala Cheney.   Then, he goes in and changes the rules (because he&#8217;s the Unitary Vice Executive President) to a simple majority, we&#8217;re golden.  </p>

                                <p>by Tom Bozzo</p>
<p>whose <a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=638879683&#038;ref=profile">Facebook</a> status currently reads, &#8220;Tom is feeling an unaccustomed sense of not-shame, at least pending some action on the economics, energy/environment, and transportation fronts.&#8221;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over at <a href="http://firedoglake.com/2009/01/23/defazio-smacks-larry-summers-for-being-anti-infrastructure/">FDL</a>, they find Rep. Peter DeFazio saying:<br />
<blockquote>I think [Obama]&#8217;s ill-advised by Larry Summers.[*] Larry Summers hates infrastructure.</p>
<p>And some of these other economists &#8212; they were very much part of creating the problem, now they&#8217;re going to solve the problem? And they don&#8217;t like infrastructure. So they want to have a consumer driven recovery.</p></blockquote>
<p>Others in the econoblogiverse ought to know (or at least offer a well-educated guess) as to whether DeFazio is right about Summers.  Paging Prof. DeLong?  A little more rant below the fold.</p>
<p>Whatever the case with Summers, the sentiments DeFazio mentions are kicking around notionally respectable provinces of the profession.  <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2009/01/is-joe-biden-disingenuous-or.html">E.g.</a>  Plus it&#8217;s <a href="http://theoverheadwire.blogspot.com/search/label/Critics">easy</a> to find rail- and transit-phobic <a href="http://www.madison.com/wsj/home/column/other/433220">op-eds</a> arguing that because 90% of commuters drive even the transit funding under the SAFETEA-LU regime is too generous.</p>
<p>The underlying problem is that helicoptering money to &#8220;consumers&#8221; by way of tax cuts or lump-sum grants a la last year&#8217;s stimulus payments does little or nothing to help satisfy demands that are latent due to incomplete markets.  Give me $100 and I can drive to Chicago for the day, not insignificantly because past public infrastructure spending built the roads from here to there.  Give everyone in Madison $100 and it still does sod all for extending the Amtrak Hiawatha service, seeing as the city was cut off from such passenger rail network as still exists in the upper Midwest and reconnecting it requires a substantial investment.  Maybe in libertarian fantasyland, there are no such things as collective action problems, but elsewhere overcoming them may be considered to be a useful function of government.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve argued, and will say again, that it isn&#8217;t necessarily desirable to rely too heavily on the stimulus for rail and transit expansion, partly because useful large expenditures a la CA and Midwest high-speed rail aren&#8217;t necessarily very good as short-term stimulus [**] and partly because it may be politically undesirable to foster the impression that the expenditures are only worthwhile when the economy is in extremis.  (Plugging holes blown in transit agencies budgets is <a href="http://www.samefacts.com/archives/2009_democratic_agenda_/2009/01/what_happened_to_transit_in_the_stimulus.php">another matter entirely</a>.)  So I&#8217;m agnostic pending information on what the surface transportation bill to follow SAFETEA-LU will look like.  If rail and transit get short shrift there, then I&#8217;ll be putting my analyst on danger money (baby).</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>[*] At least I wouldn&#8217;t expect (a) that Summers&#8217;s advisory role is telling President Obama what he wants to hear under pain of banishment, or that (b) the advisory role implies that the Summers view of anything is necessarily the Obama view.</p>
<p>[**] But committing funds to be spent in the near if not immediate future may nevertheless signal to firms that it&#8217;s safe to expand or at least not contract.</p>

<p>Via <a href="http://www.trafficworld.com/newssection/government.asp?id=49276">TrafficWorld</a>:<br />
<blockquote>According to the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, 50 percent of funds provided to states will be required to be obligated within 90 days. </p>
<p>Within 180 days of enactment, states must submit a program of projects outlining how the remaining 50 percent of the projects will be obligated within one year of enactment, according to the committee&#8217;s proposal.</p></blockquote>
<p>On the face of it, this looks good for projects that are in advanced stages of planning but not quite spade-ready — which may answer how to quickly obligate big bucks (by U.S. standards) for transit, passenger rail, and other projects more complicated than road repairs.  It also suggests that the <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2009/01/infrastructure-stimulus-amounts.html">$85 billion amount being floated</a> is an amount to be obligated in one calendar year rather than two (or the next one-and-a-half fiscal years).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, John Boehner rounded up his merry band of <a href="http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=108190">economists against the stimulus</a>.  When the <a href="http://republicanleader.house.gov/UploadedFiles/stimulusskeptics.pdf">#2 commenter</a> on the (rather low-wattage*) list of skeptics is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=luskin+stupidest+man+alive">Donald Luskin</a>, you&#8217;re in trouble.</p>

<p>Around election time, the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee had identified $45 billion in ready-to-go infrastructure projects a stimulus package.  Now <a href="http://www.trafficworld.com/newssection/government.asp?id=49234">TrafficWorld reports</a> that the Committee now is looking at $85 billion:<br />
<blockquote>The recommendations, outlined in a Dec. 12 memo, include $30 billion for highways and bridges, $12 billion for transit, $4.9 billion for passenger rail, $5 billion for airports, $14.3 billion for environmental infrastructure, $7 billion for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and $10 billion for federal buildings, according to the committee.</p></blockquote>
<p>To put this amount in perspective, under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAFETEA-LU">SAFETEA-LU</a>, the highway and transit funding bill in effect through FY09, federal highway and transit expenditures run around $60 billion/year ($284 billion for FY05-FY09), so $42 billion on highways and transit is a pretty big increment.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that $100 billion/year is necessarily a large amount of money to spend in the less-short term, especially if we want things like vastly improved transit and passenger rail systems and considering some of the things $100B/year were spent on during the Bush administration.  Politically, it seems to me that it would be better to fund the medium-term projects outside the stimulus package in a FY10+ infrastructure bill to follow SAFETEA-LU, which just so happens to be due this year.  If the projects are valuable — and many are or will be — then then they should not be funded only in case of economic emergency.</p>

<p>is amazed at the reaction of leading figures in the left blogiverse to the W$J&#8217;s &#8220;news&#8221; that there will be tax cuts as part of the stimulus.  See <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Americablog/~3/2kCzoJFbdyk/bush-obama-now-talking-300-bn-in-tax.html">Aravosis</a>, <a href="http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/stimulating-debate-by-digby-democrats.html">Digby</a>, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/05/is-obama-relying-too-much-on-tax-cuts/">Krugman</a>, <a href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/Talking-Points-Memo/~3/bwuTLArZFec/collaborative_j.php">Marshall</a>.</p>
<p>Can we cancel the circular firing squad?</p>
<p>As far as I can tell from the Journal&#8217;s reporting, the main tax elements are largely indistinguishable from what Obama was promoting in the fall.  Here, for instance, is a snippet of the <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/10/debate-transcri.html">third debate</a>:<br />
<blockquote>[Bob Schieffer:] Senator Obama, you proposed $60 billion in tax cuts for middle- income and lower-income people, more tax breaks to create jobs, new spending for public works projects to create jobs&#8230;</p>
<p>[TB Note: The $60 billion mentioned by Schieffer is an annual figure, while the $300B reported by the W$J is over two years.]</p>
<p>[Sen. Obama:] Number one, let&#8217;s focus on jobs. I want to end the tax breaks for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and provide a tax credit for every company that&#8217;s creating a job right here in America.</p>
<p>Number two, let&#8217;s help families right away by providing them a tax cut &#8212; a middle-class tax cut for people making less than $200,000, and let&#8217;s allow them to access their IRA accounts without penalty if they&#8217;re experiencing a crisis. </p></blockquote>
<p>Now Prof. Krugman&#8217;s analysis actually is pretty solid on the economics of stimulating via a combination of tax cuts and public expenditures, and he seems to detect the underlying politics.  That is, use a spoonful of tax cuts that the Obama camp was going to push anyway to peel off enough Republican votes to advance a lot of stuff that the Senate Republicans&#8217; paleolithic caucus won&#8217;t like (and, let&#8217;s face it, can&#8217;t stop, whatever Mitch McConnell might say about wanting to lend rather than grant money to the states and such).  If the &#8216;carrot&#8217; approach is followed by capitulation rather than by aggressive pressure to promote the plan a la Obama, then the political observers may have something to gripe about.</p>
<p>On the economics, I don&#8217;t especially care for the business tax cut components, which in the absence of a general loophole-closure program I&#8217;d expect would as likely as not stimulate the tax law sector of the economy while the Tax Foundation still gets to gripe about high statutory corporate rates.  And it&#8217;s a matter both of Our Stupid Discourse and government accounting methods that fail to distinguish between government consumption and investment spending that tax cuts are less controversial than appropriately targeted spending.  But anyone who&#8217;s surprised by this part of the stimulus package wasn&#8217;t paying attention during the campaign.</p>

<p><a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/11/hoocoodanode.html">CR beat me to commenting</a> on <a href="http://gregmankiw.blogspot.com/2008/11/redefining-grownup-and-hack.html">this Mankiw <s>whine</s> post</a>, partially because I couldn&#8217;t think of anything reasonable to say about it.  (CR <a href="http://calculatedrisk.blogspot.com/2008/11/hoocoodanode.html">could</a>.  That&#8217;s why he gets the big bucks.)</p>
<p>But now that CR has done the heavy lifting, let&#8217;s look at the other aspect: Mankiw&#8217;s standard:<br />
<blockquote>Based a <a href="http://ideas.repec.org/top/top.person.all.html">standard ranking</a> of economists&#8217; academic accomplishments as of October 2008&#8230;[emphasis mine]
<ol>11. Larry Summers<br />21. Greg Mankiw<br />35. Ben Bernanke<br />99. Eddie Lazear<br />132. Glenn Hubbard<br />249. Harvey Rosen<br />391. Christy Romer*<br />653. Austan Goolsbee</ol>
<p> [emphases Mankiw&#8217;s; Bush administration officials]</p></blockquote>
<p>Leaving aside whether the ranking used makes sense, we ask the next question: What does this have to do the performance of the individual <em>in a government role</em>?</p>
<p>So I realised we&#8217;ve been thinking about the Obama Administration in exactly the wrong way.</p>
<p>Several people are referencing the late David Halberstam&#8217;s <em>The Best and the Brightest</em>, a biography of the Kennedy Administration&#8217;s well-educated pedigree and their <em>policy</em> missteps.  Krugman used it as a cautionary phrase <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/11/22/the-grownups-are-coming/">in the exact post about which Mankiw whimpered</a>.  As <a href="http://angrybear.blogspot.com/2008/06/vietnam-iraq-and-preface-to-best-and.html">John McCain once wrote</a>:<br />
<blockquote>The term &#8220;best and brightest&#8221; has become an insult, not an accolade, thanks largely to Halberstam&#8217;s magnificent, scabrous epic about the <em>policymaking blunders</em> that swept the United States into Vietnam. This classic work is part of the Vietnam canon, but it is not really about Vietnam; it is very much a Washington book, focused on the surety of the hawks stateside rather than the misery and warfare in Indochina. [italics mine]</p></blockquote>
<p>But look at (most of*) Obama&#8217;s picks:
<ol>Orszag &#8211; Currently at the OMB. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Orszag#Biography">Prior experience at CEA, and then as a Special Assistant to the President during the Clinton Administration</a>.<br />Summers &#8211; veteran of the Clinton Administration<br />Geithner &#8211; veteran of the Clinton Administration<br />Paul Volcker &#8211; veteran of the Carter and Reagan Administrations, named Chair of the Federal Reserve by Carter.<br />Melody Barnes &#8211; Eight years as Chief Counsel to Senator Kennedy on the Senate Judiciary Committee<br />Heather Higginbottom &#8211; Eight years as legislative director for Senator Kerry</ol>
<p>The list goes on, but what is notable is that—with the exceptions of the Advisors Goolsbee and C. Romer—all have extensive government policy experience.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s look at the Bush people:
<ol>Mankiw &#8211; columnist for <em>Fortune</em>, textbook author. As <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/nrof_bartlett/bartlett030503.asp">Bruce Bartlett noted in 2003</a>, &#8220;Mankiw endorsed the election of George W. Bush because, unlike Al Gore, he would cut taxes, reform Social Security and antitrust policy, and try to implement school choice.&#8221; Spent <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N._Gregory_Mankiw#Education">one year as a CEA staff member</a>—twenty years prior to being named CEA Chair.<br />Lazear &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Lazear#Career">No policy-making experience </a>prior to being named to the CEA.<br />Hubbard &#8211; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Hubbard_(economics)">No policy-making experience</a> prior to being named Chair of the CEA.<br />Harvey S. Rosen &#8211; Deputy Assistant Secretary (Tax Analysis), Department of the Treasury, 1989-91, then no government experience again until named to the CEA in 2003. (Fairness note: the interim is largely a Democratic Administration. No indication what he did <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~hsr/cv11-06.pdf">from 1991 to 1993, save possibly returning to Princeton to teach</a>). Note that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2005-06-10-rosen-steps-down_x.htm">he officially did exactly that in 2005</a>, though he <a href="http://www.boston.com/business/articles/2005/02/24/bush_names_rosen_head_of_economic_council/">had warned that might happen</a>.</ol>
<p>Comparing the actual policy experience of the two Administrations, references to Halberstam&#8217;s work are <strong>much more applicable to the Bush Administration than the incoming Obama Administration</strong>. </p>
<p>Despite having a relative disadvantage in looking for people with policy-making experience (eight years with a Democrat in the executive branch over the past 28 years v. Bush&#8217;s twelve of the previous twenty), the Bush Administration&#8217;s combined highlights list has less total experience in policy-making than Summers alone.</p>
<p>Knowing how to make sausage is a Comparative Advantage when one is working in a sausage-making environment.  Otherwise, you just end up with a &#8220;hack.&#8221;</p>
<p>*Mankiw uses Greg and Ben and Eddie as well, so I assume the use of &#8220;Christy&#8221; is not meant to pejorative.  Firedoglake&#8217;s mileage may vary.<br />**Goolsbee is the notable exception, and he is in a Senior Advisory role, specifically <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-thu-goolsbeenov27,0,2958482.story">the Economic Recovery Advisory Board, where he will be working with Paul Volcker</a>.</p>

<p>PGL raises and answers this question over at Econospeak <a href="http://econospeak.blogspot.com/2008/11/healthcare-debate-so-this-is-why.html">Health Care Debate: So This is Why Conservatives Hate Social Security</a>. Or rather he allows Conservatives in the person of Michael Cannon at Cato admit the fundamental truth: successful government social programs fatally undercut future political success for the Right. Cannon: <a href="http://www.cato-at-liberty.org/2008/11/13/blocking-obamas-health-plan-is-key-to-the-gops-survival">Blocking Obama&#8217;s Health Plan is Key to the GOP&#8217;s Survival</a></p>
<p>PGL sums it up as follows:<br />
<blockquote>Truth be told – this is a major reason why conservatives want to undermine the Social Security program. Yes – they do try to tell us it’s some sort of Ponzi scheme, which of course, is just blatant dishonesty. But the real reason that they hate Social Security is that it is popular – as well as good policy from the perspective of those who care at least as much about the working class as the investor class.</p></blockquote>
<p> Another way of saying this is that the debate over Social Security is not and never really has been about the best way to insure retirement security for workers, opponents simply don&#8217;t care that their numbers don&#8217;t add up, when indeed they use numbers at all. Instead they approach the subject from two conjoined perspectives: one that Social Security (and Universal Health Care coverage) is Socialism and/or two that Social Security (and Universal Health Care) if perceived to be successful are political winners for the Democrats for possibly decades to come.</p>
<p>In practice it is hard to separate out the Hayekians who believe that all of this is just the first steps on the <a href="http://www.mises.org/books/TRTS/">Road to Serfdom</a> from the Rovians who believe that successful social programs are instead the Road to Political Oblivian for the Republican Party from the Sheep who simply know what they have been told. And of course these groups all to a degree cross-cut, it is difficult to reliably differentiate knave from fool. But no one who cares about Social Security or Universal Health Care coverage should assume that the opposition they encounter are solely motivated by data about program effectiveness and relative costs, that you are going to get through to these people by explaining how small the problem is in the case of Social Security or how honest cross-country cost/outcome numbers show that other developing countries get more bang for their health care buck, that is to make the simple mistake that political discourse on these topics is fundamentally Reality Based instead of being what it really is: driven by ideology on one hand and political outcomes on the other.</p>
<p>For many, many people the claim &#8220;There is no Crisis&#8221; is not the answer to a specific problem, instead it IS the problem. Without &#8216;Crisis&#8217; they got nothing. And the smarter, better informed ones know it (hence the whiff of panic floating around the halls of Cato).</p>

<p>I guess we can pretend he&#8217;s not a Clinton administration alum.  And he has the right experience:<br />
<blockquote>Though not an economist, Mr. Geithner has a deep understanding of monetary and fiscal policy and broad experience in international trade issues. Before the current crisis, he was involved in the bailouts of Mexico, Indonesia, Korea, Brazil and Thailand.</p></blockquote>
<p>He also continues the tradition of being younger than most of the posters at Angry Bear.</p>
