Col. Daniel L. Davis<strong> </strong>and the pdf at <a href="http://www1.rollingstone.com/extras/RS_REPORT.pdf" target->Rolling Stone</a>.<br />
<blockquote>Earlier this week, the New York Times’ Scott Shane published a <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/world/asia/army-colonel-challenges-pentagons-afghanistan-claims.html?_r=1">bombshell piece</a> about Lt. Colonel Daniel Davis, a 17-year Army veteran recently returned from a second tour in Afghanistan. According to the Times, the 48-year-old Davis had written an 84-page unclassified report, as well as a classified report, offering his assessment of the decade-long war. That assessment is essentially that the war has been a disaster and the military&#8217;s top brass has not leveled with the American public about just how badly it’s been going.</p></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AB, <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2011/02/what-ir-can-learn-from-nhl.html">late Thursday</a>:<br />
<blockquote>If you want to stop a dictator from killing his people, freeze any of his personal assets that are held out of the country.</p>
<p>In cases where the dictator is likely to fall, it sends a clear signal to other countries. (In cases where the dictator is likely to succeed, the worst case scenario is that banking relationships will be damaged, a consideration that the domestic government would have considered before making the decision to freeze the assets in the first place.)</p>
<p>The purpose of financial in lieu of military intervention is to balance the tradeoff. A dictator whose funds will remain unencumbered no matter how many of his people he kills will not change his behavior. A dictator who stands to lose <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/22/gaddafi-libya-oil-wealth-portfolio">a large (and increasing) portion of $70 billion</a> faces a scenario where extending his time in office may well appear too costly.</p></blockquote>
<p>Treasury, <a href="http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/US-Freezes-At-Least-%2430-Billion-in-Libyan-Assets.aspx">Friday night</a>:<br />
<blockquote>On Friday evening, President Obama took decisive steps to hold the Qadhafi regime accountable for its continued use of violence against unarmed civilians and its human rights abuses and to safeguard the assets of the people of Libya.</p>
<p>The President issued an Executive Order freezing the assets of Muammar Qadhafi and four of his children, as well as the Government of Libya and its agencies, including the Central Bank of Libya and the Libyan Investment Authority – the country’s sovereign wealth fund.</p></blockquote>
<p>I report. You decide.</p>
