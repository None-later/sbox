				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Caught from the Washington Post&#8230;and also interesting knowing the<a target="_blank" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/aug/27/pacific-free-trade-deal?CMP=twt_gu">Trans Pacific agreements</a> allowing multinational CEOs and firms to sue in domestic courts:
<div><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/apple-patents-were-violated-by-samsung-jury-rules/2012/08/24/d4e44b2a-ee3b-11e1-afd8-097e90f99d05_story.html">Apple patents were violated by Samsung, jury rules</a><br />Apple won a sweeping victory in its <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/apple-samsung-have-their-final-say-in-court/2012/08/22/58918786-ec56-11e1-9ddc-340d5efb1e9c_story.html">landmark patent dispute</a> against Samsung when a Silicon Valley jury ruled Friday that a series of popular smartphone and tablet features — from the rounded rectangle shape to the way screens slide and bounce to the touch — are proprietary Apple innovations.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/tokyo-court-finds-no-samsung-infringement-on-apple-patent-in-latest-in-global-battle/2012/08/31/49b14bf4-f348-11e1-adc6-87dfa8eff430_story.html%20Chinese">Tokyo court finds no Samsung infringement on Apple patent in latest in global battle </a><br />A Japanese court on Friday dismissed Apple’s patent infringement claim against Samsung, a significant legal bounceback for the South Korean tech giant as the rivals wage a global battle over intellectual property. A Tokyo District Court ruled in a preliminary session that Samsung didn’t violate patents with its technology for synchronizing music and video between computers and smartphones or tablets. The ruling, the latest in a series of lawsuits and counter-lawsuits spanning at least nine countries and four continents, comes one week after a <a href="http://www.blogger.com/blogger.g?blogID=5048766">U.S. court dealt Samsung a costly defeat </a>that could lead to an injunction against some of its devices.

But now some in China are pointing the finger back. In recent months, Apple has been slapped with <a href="http://wapo.st/A3y291">lawsuits in China </a>alleging that the <a href="http://wapo.st/Snddk4">most valuable company in U.S. history</a> is infringing on patents and trademarks with a range of its products, from the iPhone voice assistant Siri to the Snow Leopard operating system. Many U.S. firms are used to accusing the Chinese of mimicking their products. But the lawsuits being filed in Chinese courts are evidence of a growing awareness in this country that intellectual property can be a valuable tool — for protecting your ideas and for squeezing money out of other companies, too, reports <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/jia-lynn-yang/2011/03/03/ABnOHIQ_page.html">Jia Lynn Yang</a>:</div>

<p>U.S. Trade Deficit Largely Due to &#8220;Intra-Firm&#8221; Trade</p>
<p> The vast majority of the U.S. $727 billion trade deficit in goods for 2011 is due to &#8220;intra-firm&#8221; or &#8220;related party&#8221; trade, that is, trade between two units of the same corporation, according to the <a href="http://sasweb.ssd.census.gov/relatedparty/">U.S. Census Bureau</a>. This is significant because such trade is the most open to companies manipulating the prices between subsidiaries to minimize tax liabilities, usually known as abusive <a href="http://middleclasspoliticaleconomist.blogspot.com/2011/11/how-transfer-pricing-hurts-middle-class.html">transfer pricing</a>. Moreover, as <a href="http://www.spokesmanbooks.com/acatalog/Stuart_Holland.html">Stuart Holland </a>argued in 1987, intra-firm trade is also less responsive to changes in exchange rates than is trade between independent businesses, since within an individual multinational corporation each subsidiary will have a specific role to play in its supply chain, which won&#8217;t be quickly changed.    </p>
<p>U.S. goods trade and related party trade (billions of dollars), world and selected countries, 2011:    <br />Country        Exports from US Imports to US Balance    <br />World            $1480.4     $2707.8          &#8211; $727.4    <br />World (RP)     $ 365.0      $1056.2          &#8211; $691.2    <br />Canada          $ 280.9      $ 315.3            -$  34.5    <br />Canada (RP)   $ 98.1        $ 162.0           &#8211; $ 64.1    <br />Ireland           $ 7.6          $ 39.4             &#8211; $ 31.7    <br />Ireland (RP)    $ 1.5          $ 34.6             &#8211; $ 33.1    <br />Mexico           $ 196.4      $ 262.9            &#8211; $ 64.5    <br />Mexico (RP)    $ 60.5        $ 155.7            &#8211; $ 95.2</p>
<p>Sources: Total trade, U.S. Census, <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c0015.html">Trade in Good with World, Not Seasonally Adjusted</a>; Related party (RP) trade, U.S. Census, <a href="http://sasweb.ssd.census.gov/relatedparty/">NAICS Related-Party</a>, select all NAICS2, 2011, all countries, variables &#8220;imports related trade&#8221; and &#8220;exports related trade&#8221; and layout by country. <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c1220.html">Canada</a>, <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c4190.html">Ireland</a>, and <a href="http://www.census.gov/foreign-trade/balance/c2010.html">Mexico</a> as linked.    </p>
<p>As we can see, related party trade (which can mean trade within either a U.S. or foreign multinational corporation) is 27.6% of goods trade, but it represents a whopping 95.0% of the trade deficit. Moreover, in</p>
<p><a name="more"></a></p>
<p>countries where the U.S. has heavy foreign direct investment, such as Canada, Ireland, and Mexico, the trade deficit for intra-firm trade actually exceeds the country&#8217;s overall trade deficit.<br />In fact, virtually all U.S. imports from Ireland take the form of intra-firm trade. This is no doubt due to Ireland&#8217;s status as a tax haven and low corporate income tax rate of 12.5%.    </p>
<p>These data suggest that much of the U.S. trade deficit is due to U.S. corporations offshoring production and exporting the products back home. As the related-party data does not distinguish between U.S. and foreign multinationals, there is no way to know exactly how big the share of U.S. multinationals is in intra-firm, but is surely much more than half. Moreover, not counted in the data are imports that come from subcontractors (Wal-Mart&#8217;s many suppliers, Foxconn producing Apple products, etc.).    </p>
<p>The bottom line is that we need to reverse the incentives in the tax code that encourage the offshoring of jobs. (Why does <a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/03/apple-whines-about-having-to-pay-taxes.html">Apple have $64 billion in cash abroad</a>?) However, to emphasize the point I made<a href="http://www.angrybearblog.com/2012/08/it-middle-class-stupid-review.html"> last time</a> about what Americans want out of tax reform and the &#8220;reform&#8221; that has actually happened, it&#8217;s worth pointing out that Robert Gilpin of Princeton University, author of the seminal <i>U.S. Power and the Multinational Corporation</i> (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/U-S-Power-Multinational-Corporation-international/dp/0465089518">1975</a>), made the same policy recommendation almost 40 years ago, and it hasn&#8217;t happened yet. We&#8217;ve got our work cut out for us.</p>
<p>UPDATE: Following the Mitt George Romney rule (&#8220;one year might be a fluke&#8221;), I went back and collected the data for all years back to 2002 (the earliest for which the related party trade info was available). While 2009-11 were all 95%, previous years were generally between 70% and 80%. I&#8217;m not sure yet what to make of that.</p>

<p>Other links talk about the lack of interim transparency and drafts of agreements to date, continuance of secret deliberations when making decisions on trade &#8216;infractions. and the enhanced ability of companies to sue domestic industries (a la WTO) in domestic courts:</p>
