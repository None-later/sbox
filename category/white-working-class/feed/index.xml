				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>John Quiggin writes at  <a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2012/09/10/the-white-working-class/">Crooked Timber</a> on a not new discussion on what constitutes &#8220;white working class&#8221; or &#8220;whiteworkingclass&#8221; used in media descriptions.  In comments there are several who tackle the question well&#8230;.Bruce Wilder for one.  I am not sure there is a clear answer without considering geographical issues and histories, rural/city/suburb issues, and such, but has implications for who we notice as important.</p>
<blockquote><p>All became clear(or, at least, clearer) when I discovered that US political discussion uses two very different (though correlated) concepts of “working class”. The first is the more or less standard one – people who depend on wage labor (normally in manual or low-status service occupations) for their income. The second, specific to the US, and standard in most political polling, is “people without a 4-year college degree”, a class which includes such horny-handed sons and daughters of toil as Bill Gates and Paris Hilton. More prosaically, it includes lots of small business owners, and (since college graduation rates were rising until relative recently), over-represents the old.</p>
<p>Data on US voting patterns is surprisingly scarce, but Andrew Gelman has a big data set confirming the point that <a href="http://themonkeycage.org/blog/2012/03/23/voting-patterns-of-americas-whites-from-the-masses-to-the-elites/">Republican voting rises with income</a>&#8230;<br />&#8230;<br />As the pie chart below illustrates, the biggest group in the Republican voting base, and the group with which they do best is that of middle/high income whites without college degrees (the percentage after the group name gives the Republican share of the vote for that group). There’s nothing surprising in this, since all three variables are correlated with Republican voting. It’s the practice of calling this group “working class” that causes the confusion.</p></blockquote>
