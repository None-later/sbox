<p>Foreign-owned US insurance companies frequently reinsure through their foreign affiliates and then claim a deduction under section 832(b)(4)(A) for the reinsurance premium paid to the affiliate to reduce the US tax liability of the US company.</p>
<p>Rep. Richard Neal (D-Ma) introduced a bill on October 12 that has been referred to the House Ways &#038; Means Committee, where it now languishes unattended by the Republican chair, David Camp of Michigan.  <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c112:H.R.3157:">H.R. 3157</a> amends the Internal Revenue Code to create a new section 849, which disallows the deduction for certain reinsurance premiums and related amounts paid to non-taxed foreign affiliates, defined as members of a controlled group, with 50% rather than the usual 80% used to define a control relationship. </p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The President&#8217;s FY 2012 Budget included a similar proposal for disallowing some affiliated reinsurance premium amounts.  Earlier iterations of a disallowance bill were introduced in 2000 and 2001.  A bill with somewhat broader disallowance provisions, H.R. 3424, was introduced by Representative Neal in 2010 and did receive a hearing at Ways &#038; Means that year.  <!-- more --> The Joint Committee on Taxation issued a report on reinsurance with offshore affiliates prior to the hearings on H.R. 3424 in 2010, titled &#8220;Present Law And Analysis Relating To The Tax Treatment Of Reinsurance Transactions Between Affiliated Entities&#8221;, <a href="http://www.jct.gov/publications.html?func=startdown&#038;id=3690">JCX-35-10</a> (including a description of HR 3424 and the President&#8217;s FY 2012 proposal, beginning at page 22).  As noted in the JCT report:</p>
<blockquote><p>When these assets are shifted from a U.S. insurer to an offshore reinsurer with a foreign parent, these earnings may no longer be subject to U.S. income taxation. If the U.S. insurer and the offshore reinsurer are affiliated, the profits attributable to the reinsured risks remain within the affiliated group, although the earnings on the assets may no longer be subject to U.S.income taxation. (footnotes deleted)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If the offshore affiliate is in a low or no-tax jurisdiction, the result may be almost no tax  on the reinsurance premium amounts (other than the applicable excise tax, if not eliminated by treaty).  Not surprisingly, the trend over the last few decades has been towards reinsurance arrangements with affiliates:  between 2001 and 2008, ceding of insurance of offshore affiliates grew by more than 108%, while ceding of insurance to nonaffiliated offshore entities grew by only 16%.  See JCT report at 11, n.21 and accompanying text.  Bermuda, a jurisdiction with no corporate tax and one especially friendly to insurers, is the most frequent jurisdiction for these affiliated reinsurance transactions.  The JCT report notes that the lack of a market price for affiliate transactions provides an incentive to shift income between affiliates at off-market prices.</p>
<p>Also not surprisingly, lobbyists for these foreign-owned insurance companies have fiercely fought the possibility that this handy tax-reduction technique might be legislated away.  The &#8220;Coalition for Competitive Insurance Rates&#8221; put out a press release on November 29, praising Republican lawmakers from Florida who had joined in a letter, available <a href="http://abir.createsend4.com/t/y/i/ydlyjhd/l/t/">here</a>, opposing the bill. The claim is that eliminating the tax avoidance technique will be a &#8220;punitive tax on reinsurance&#8221; that would &#8220;lead to higher premium costs&#8221; because it would &#8220;impose a tariff on international reinsurance firms&#8221;  and that this would amount to &#8220;punitive and anti-competitive taxes.&#8221; </p>
<p>The Florida Republican representatives note that 90% of Florida&#8217;s insurance is reinsured offshore.  The fact that such affiliate reinsurance is widespread does not mean that it is a better means of risk management.  The regular amount of US taxes that would be charged on those US affiliates&#8221; income is not a &#8220;punitive&#8221; tax: it is merely the amount of tax that those firms would pay if they do not use affiliates as reinsurers. </p>
<p>Note that moving the insurance to an affiliate doesn&#8217;t achieve the risk-shifting that reinsurance is designed to accomplish&#8211;it retains the risk within the controlled group.  (The IRS litigated a number of captive insurance cases under the theory that a controlled group constitutes a single economic &#8220;family&#8221; and hence cannot achieve risk-shift or risk-diversification.  Although courts were hesitant to adopt this theory, it does seem to capture the essence of the affiliate reinsurance problem.  The JCT report noted above also suggests the theory as a means of addressing the tax avoidance technique.)  Although lobbyists claim that reinsurance with affiliates is a valuable &#8220;risk-management&#8221; tool and that reinsurance with affiliates accomplishes the same risk management as reinsurance with non-affiliated parties, it seems that reinsurance within a controlled group does not provide the same risk protection as nonaffiliated reinsurance.   A catastrophic event covered by the reinsurer could result in liquidation of its assets, including its interest in the US affiliate.</p>
<p>Insurers using offshore affiliate reinsurers claim that there are nonetheless real non-tax advantages: (i) reducing adverse selection/moral hazard from information asymetry between insurer and reinsurer and (ii) &#8220;allowing risk and capital to be moved more easily &#8230; to respond to changing market conditions.&#8221;  See Cragg, Cummins &#038; Zhou, The Impact of a U.S. Tax on Offshore Reinsurance Market, The<a href="http://www.brattle.com/_documents/uploadlibrary/upload863.pdf">Brattle Group</a> , May 1, 2009 (research funded by the Coalition for Competitive Insurance Rates projecting a 2.1 &#8211; 2.4% rise in insurance costs upon elimination of the affiliate reinsurance scheme) (also cited in the JCT report for these claims). </p>
<p>These so-called advantages of affiliate reinsurance appear spurious.  First, while the interests of the insurer and its affiliated reinsurer are aligned (so that the insurer will have less incentive to select the worse policies for that affiliated reinsurer or to be lax in its policy making for policies it will reinsure with its affiliate), the absence of real risk-shifting would make that alignment of little real value.  Alternatively, as the JCT report notes, the aligning of interests may mean that the premium paid to affiliated reinsurers should be <em>lower</em> than the third-party premium, meaning that much of the affiliated reinsurance market may result in understatement of the US company&#8217;s income. Furthermore, nonaffiliated reinsurers may well undertake more comprehensive due diligence connected with taking on real reinsurance risk, and thus in fact contribute to a better risk-balanced insurance market.  </p>
<p>Second, the claim that reinsuring with offshore affiliates allows for easier movement of capital in response to market conditions is of little real benefit to the U.S. insurance market.  The foreign parent that reinsures the U.S. affiliate has received an advantage from having that reinsurance premium as its capital while at the same time reducing its US affiliate&#8217;s tax liability, but that merely substantiates the complaint of domestic companies that the ability to reinsure with a foreign affiliate gives an unjust  competitive advantage&#8211;the double whammy of the tax deduction to the US affiliate and the capital infusion to the foreign company.  Further, as we saw in the 2008 financial crisis,  globalization of interactions among financial companies can have deeply negative systemic effects. </p>
<p>On balance, eliminating the deduction for affiliate reinsurance premiums is not the creation of an &#8220;anti-competitive tax&#8221; whenthe insurer is using the affiliate to shift income offshore and avoid paying U.S. corporate taxes.   In fact, the ability of some insurance companies to offshore preimums is itself anti-competitive, since it puts wholly domestic U.S. insurance companies at a disadvantage.</p>

<p><a href="http://ataxingmatter.blogs.com/tax/2011/12/gops-unemployment-compensation-and-payroll-tax-cut-up-for-vote-on-tuesday.html">GOP&#8217;s payroll tax cut bill (with a lot of other stuff) up for vote on Tuesday</a>
<p>[edited 2 pm 12/13 to provide additional links to news coverage of some of the changes]</p>
<p>Congress has been playing politics as usual over the few policies that are on the table that have a real chance of assisting, to some degree, the plight of ordinary Americans and perhaps even the slow recovery that is still trying to gain steam&#8211;extension of the reduction in payroll taxes (from 6.2% to 4.2%) and extension of unemployment compensation.</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>The Republicans have refused to pay for these common sense tax reductions for ordinary Americans with a similarly common sense tax increase on the wealthiest Americans who have continued to capture all the productivity gains in the economyt.  Republicans in the House think that these kinds of provisions should be offset by more goodies for the &#8220;uberclass&#8221;&#8211;at least as evidenced by the <a href="http://rules.house.gov/Media/file/PDF_112_1/legislativetext/HR_1209.pdf">H.R. 3630</a>, the bill introduced by Dave Camp (R-MI) and to be voted on today at about 4:30 pm. </p>
<ul>
<li>It would restructure unemployment compensation in ways that add hurdles and make it less likely that unemployed Americans will qualify&#8211;providing more state flexibility and experimentation (including paying employers to cover part of cost of wages exceeding the recipient&#8217;s prior benefit level), permitting demeaning drug testing of all unemployment compensation recipients (section 2127), and requiring a high school diploma or participation in state &#8220;reemployment services&#8221; for which recipients may be charged up to $5 weekly out of their unemployment compensation.  It would severely curtail the total number of weeks for which federal unemployment assistance is available&#8211;moving to a 59-week limit from a 99-week limit.  Methinks I see Scrooge here&#8230;.. </li>
<li>It will interfere with the Environmental Protection Agency&#8217;s ability to regulate, letting corporations continue to harm the environment at the expense of ordinary Americans.   See Subtitle B.  Section 1102(b) lists rules that are &#8220;stayed&#8221; by the legislation and provides that no new rules can have an effective date earlier than 5 years out and requires consideration of various factors in determining that date.  Further, it requires adoption of the laxer 2000 definitions for certain key terms and the imposition of the &#8220;least burdensome&#8221; among potential regulatory alternatives.  This is a key cave-in to corporate polluters.  </li>
<li>It will expedite the KeystoneXL pipeline by requiring a permit to be issued within 60 days unless within that time the President determines that the pipeline will not serve the national interest (in which case within 15 days the President must provide various committees and members of Congress a report justifying that conclusion from various perspectives).  It indicates that the environmental impact statement from August will be treated as satisfactory for environmental and historical preservation purposes and shall not have to be supplemented if there are modifications to the plan  and no further federal environmental review shall be allowed.  This is a clearly ideologically driven provision, failing to give due regard to the potential longterm environmental impact on drinking water aquifers or historical preservation impact.  </li>
<li>It would provide yet another tax reduction for US corporations that have paid less and less taxes over the last decade, with a renewal of the ill-advised 100% expensing provision in section 168(k)(5) (along with the alternative of accelerating AMT credits) </li>
<li>it makes further changes to medicare such as applying a cap to hospital outpatient therapy services and reversing part of the Health Reform Act passed earlier, by permitting new doctor-owned hospitals and permitting existing ones to expand, even though it has been shown that such hospitals spend more on testing and procedures (and profit more from them).  See, e.g., Pear, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/health/policy/republican-tax-and-unemployment-bill-would-help-hospitals-owned-by-doctors.html">G.O.P. Bill Would Benefit Doctor Owned Hospitals</a>, New York Times at A24, Dec. 13, 2011. </li>
<li>it would continue funding for the &#8220;healthy marriage and responsible fatherhood&#8221; initiative, see <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/usc_sec_42_00000603----000-.html">42 U.S.C. section 603(a)(2)</a>  (the cynic in me suspects that these funds primarily go to programs supported by religious institutions and that they proselytize more than they teach reasonable relationship skills) </li>
<li>it includes an extensive section remaking flood insurance provisions, including, in section 3005, lifting the cap for premium increases for flood insurance from 10% to 20% (an apparent boon to insurers), and another section prohibiting the administration from &#8220;disregarding&#8221; any levee or floodwall, even if it is not accredited.  <strong>The goal, made clear in section 3009, is privatization of the national flood insurance program</strong>. </li>
<li>It includes extensive broadband spectrum auction provisions in Title IV, Subtitle A, reallocating spectrum from federal to nonfederal use.  These provisions, among many detailed ones, e.g., <strong>permit private administrators of state public safety networks to use the public spectrum for private purposes as well as the public safety  purpose</strong>and prevent states from denying requests for modifications of existing wireless towers that do not substantially change the physical dimensions thereof. </li>
<li>It increases the guarantee fees charged by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. </li>
<li>It requires a social security number for the refundable child credit</li>
<li>It provides in section 5895 a 100% tax on &#8220;excess unemployment benefits&#8221; that go to millionaires (unemployment compensation is reduced proportionately as the adjusted gross income increases from $750,000 to $1 million)&#8211;The Times today has an article on the bill and notes that the number of millionaires receiving unemployment compensation is very small, but that their participation is predicated on the fact that the unemployment compensation program is a type of insurance into which payments are made to cover payouts.  <strong>Means testing such insurance programs is in sync with the right-wing goal of means-testing as a prelude to privatizing and/or eliminating all federally administered social welfare insurance programs, such as medicare and Social Security (and, see above, national flood insurance).</strong></li>
<li>It increases pension contributions from longterm federal workers by .5% a year for 2012-2014 and for those &#8220;secure annuity employees&#8221; with less than five years of service, by more than 10% a year and using 5 year average pay rather than 3 year average pay, sets annuity amounts, and ends the annuity supplement for post-2012 retirees. </li>
<li>it extends the general freeze on federal pay for another year</li>
<li>It increases the premiums for Medicare Part B and Part D for those making $80,000 or more (for those making $200,000 or more, the applicable percentage is 90%)&#8211;this again appears to move these national social welfare insurance programs towards more means-testing that will facilitate privatization or eventual elimination.  </li>
<li><strong>It sets up a number of procedural hurdles in the Senate, which is already hogtied by the ease with which a minority of its members can filibuster and thus stop legislation that is supported by a solid majority of its members.  For examples,</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>it requires a 2/3 vote in the Senate to amend the dates for section 601(c) of the <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-111hr4853enr/pdf/BILLS-111hr4853enr.pdf">2010 Tax Relief Act</a>&#8211;that&#8217;s the temporary employee payroll tax cut;</strong></li>
<li><strong>it provides that a point of order by any Senator against an emergency designation in a bill eliminates that designation and makes it impossible to bring the designation through a floor amendment unless there is a supermajority 3/5 vote in favor of doing so (limiting debate to 1 hour)&#8211;thus one right-wing Senator intent on obstructionism can make it very unlikely that an important provision can pass by preventing even reasonable debate about the importance of the provision!</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The GOP, of course, touts its bill as creating jobs.   While the Keystone pipeline may create some short-term jobs (the New YorkTimes reports estimates from Transcanada itself  and the State Department of only about 6500 temporary construction jobs  and maybe 50 permanent new jobs&#8211;see <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/opinion/keystone-claptrap.html">Keystone Claptrap</a>, Editorial, New York Times at A34, Dec. 13, 2011), the potential negative impact on aquifers could be life-threatening.  Most of the other provisions are Scrooge-like additions of hurdles and caps on social welfare provisions or attempts to roll back the social welfare insurance provisions into means-tested ones that will be even more susceptible to the derogatory and inflamatory class-action warfare that the right has increasingly unleashed on anything that doesn&#8217;t give a break to the wealthy and corporate clients of the all-powerful Washington lobbies. </p>
<p>On lobbies, just read the New York Times article about the wealth that online educators are getting from state and federal taxpayer dollars for delivering no or sub-standard education, and the amount of taxpayer money being spent on lobbying to ensure the continuous flow of that wealth.  See Saul, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/13/education/online-schools-score-better-on-wall-street-than-in-classrooms.html">Profits and Problems at Online Charter Schools</a>, New York Times, Dec. 12, 2011.  It&#8217;s obvious that the corporatist agenda sees no problem with siphoning off taxpayer dollars for private benefit with little public good created, but complains mightily about any siphoning off of exorbitant corporate profits&#8211;that tend to go to wasteful excess managerial compensation or portfolio enhancement&#8211;for taxes intended for public benefit.</p>
<p>The inclusion of the Keystone and other right-wing-rhetoric-driven items in a bill to provide the payroll tax cut and a limited unemployment extension (with hurdles) demonstrates the absurd level of ideological partisanship engaged in by the House Republicans.  Senate Majority Leader Reid characterized the bill as loaded with &#8220;ideological candy&#8221; that the Senate would reject.  Sloan &#038; Rubin, <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/12/13/bloomberg_articlesLW5T8C6K50Z4.DTL">House to Vote on Payroll Bill as senate Eyes Tax Sweeteners</a>, Bloomberg.com (Dec. 13, 2011).    Of course, most of the sweeteners that Reid proposes adding are components of the right-wing corporate-friendly agenda&#8211;like the R&#038;D credit that rewards what companies do anyway; the active financing exception for big banks, insurers and other financial institutions that lets them defer taxation on their financing income earned overseas; and accelerated depreciation for restaurants and motorsports tracks that provide special tax subsidies to particular industries!</p>

<p>The Hill reports on &#8220;supercommittee
<p>Alexander Bolton reports that &#8220;<a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/news/193697-with-supercommittee-deadlocked-reid-and-boehner-meet-">With Supercommittee Deadlocked, leaders Reid and Boehner meet</a>&#8220;, The Hill (Nov. 15, 2011).  Reid (Dem) and Boehner (GOP) met Tuesday, but aides told The Hill that &#8220;They&#8217;re not about to dive in&#8221; to the negotiations.  But as the committee seems to be at an impasse close to the 11/23 deadline, the leaders must be discussing what is likely to be the next step.  The arrangements for the group (in case no bipartisan deal could be reached) called for across-the-board cuts that impose reasonable cuts on Defense but limited cuts for social safety net/earned benefit programs (medicare limited to 2% cuts to insurance companies and health care providers/Social Security and Medicaid exempt).</p>
<p>The GOP members, of course, are casting it as a Dem problem. For example, Hensarling (a very far right member of the group, from Texas) blamed the Dems for not accepting the Toomey proposal for a piddling $300 billion in new tax revenue.  <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/news/193697-with-supercommittee-deadlocked-reid-and-boehner-meet-">With Supercommittee Deadlocked, leaders Reid and Boehner meet</a>. </p>
<p>The across-the-board cuts would cut Defense by $500 billion.  Various GOP members of Congress have said they want to change the deal to avoid the cuts to the military.  Tea Party favorite and radical right-winger Jim DeMint has essentially admitted that he never intended to stick with the sequester deal, saying that the GOP has &#8220;until next election to fix this thing.&#8221;  GOP stalwarts want the US to maintain its exorbitant spending as &#8220;the world&#8217;s only military superpower&#8221; even while being willing to cut health care and pensions to the vulnerable and even while the country&#8217;s infrastructure&#8211;essential for business&#8211;crumbles in ruins.  McCain and Graham urged the Senate to reject the sequester of military funds, fearful it would &#8220;set off a swift decline of the United States as the world&#8217;s leading military power.&#8221; <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/193861-dems-gain-upper-hand">Dems gain upper hand in deficit talks</a>, The Hill (Nov. 16, 2011).  <a name="more"></a> This attitude seems to believe that defense spending, no matter what the cost to the country, is okay, while spending on poor people is a waste and raising taxes on the rich is an impossibility.  Apparently GOP McKeon considered that possibility, but then later backtracked.  Certainly, Grover Norquist has been making sure the pressure is on from the corporate masters of our pseudo-democracy&#8211;the Hill notes Norquist&#8217;s statement Monday that both Senate and House GOP leaders had &#8220;assured him they would not raise taxes to reduce the deficit.&#8221;  Id.</p>
<p>So we have elected representatives in Congress who willfully ignore the will of the majority of people in favor of higher taxes and higher taxes on the rich and corporations in particular; ignore the facts that show that higher taxes on the rich and a more equal economy are better for everybody; and ignore the fact that their own policies (preemptive war and tax cuts during deficits from 2001-2008 under Bush) represent the substantial reason for long-term deficits&#8211;all in order to continue to support extraordinarily disproportionate spending on the military rather than on public infrastructure, education and health and in order to be able to continue to use the self-created &#8220;debt crisis&#8221; to push for further impoverization of America&#8217;s middle class.  What a backwards value system that represents can&#8217;t be expressed in a public blog.</p>
<p>But at least Reid has said that method of reneging on the agreement won&#8217;t be allowed to happen: &#8220;Democrats aren&#8217;t going to take an unfair, unrealistic load directed toward domestic discretionary spending and take it away from the military.&#8221;    See Id.; see also <a href="http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/193753-reid-dems-will-oppose-efforts-to-spare-defense-from-automatic-cuts">Reid: Dems will oppose efforts to spare Defense from automatic cuts</a>, The Hil (Nov. 14, 2011).</p>
<p>As one of the commenters on The Hill notes (quoting an NPR program), the supercommittee is set up to force one of two bad choices&#8211;reducing the social safety net or cutbacks during economic recession.  What we should be doing is increasing taxes now on the rich and on corporations, and then allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire at the end of next year&#8211;in their entirety.  We should make judicious spending cuts in wasteful programs&#8211;and the military certainly should be a target of some of those cuts.  And we should make judicious spending increases in infrastructure, research and educational support programs to add stimulus to keep the economy going.</p>
<p>Case in point&#8211;the New York Times story today about a small town in Kentucky that decided to increase taxes to pay for infrastructure improvements that are putting the two back on the map.</p>

<p>GOP two-step approach problematic
<p>Discussion continued apace yesterday about the &#8220;supercommittee&#8221; and the idea of agreeing to agree someday on some revenue increases while going ahead with cuts.</p>
<p>This approach is a terrible one since it gives the obstructionist GOP members just another setting in which to refuse to go ahead with tax increases and to &#8220;negotiate&#8221; yet again over just what counts as a revenue increase.  Like the gimmicks that became so overused in the 2001, 2003, 2004 Bush tax bills, this &#8220;deal&#8221; is just another gimmick for the radical right to get its way&#8211;cuts to Social Security and Medicare, cuts to all programs intended to help the vulnerable, no cuts to military programs, and no tax increases&#8211;especially not for the rich.</p>
<p>Republicans on the right are already arguing for applying &#8220;dynamic analysis&#8221; which tends, in their versions, to be rosy scenarios of increased growth due to tax cuts:  <a name="more"></a> this is a cop-out way to claim revenue increases that won&#8217;t materialize while making actual cuts to much needed social programs.  They are also arguing for dramatic changes in the way the earned benefits programs work&#8211;such as means-testing for recipients&#8211;as first steps in working towards outright elimination of those programs.  You get comments like those of Jim Jordan (Republican of Ohio) who wrote in an op-ed in USA Today that taxes &#8220;should not punish success to satisfy some false definition of balance.&#8221;  See Rubin,  <a href="http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-14/debt-accord-may-be-two-step-process-hensarling-says.html">Debt Accord May be Two-Step Process, Hensarling Says</a>, Bloomberg (Nov. 14, 2011).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jim Jordan (Republican of Ohio) said in a USA Today piece that taxes should not be raised because they &#8220;should not punish success to satisfy some false definition of balance.&#8221;  Id. </p>
<p>This is a wrongheaded view of taxes.  The radical right uses language about taxes &#8220;punishing success&#8221; because they see defending the rich from  taxation as their mission.  The rich are defined as &#8220;successful&#8221;&#8211;even if the wealth is merely built on top of inherited wealth and position, and even if the rich did nothing at all to earn the wealth.  Taxes do not punish success.  Taxes are the way that we cooperate together to fund important government programs that serve all of us.  Even when they act as transfer programs that transfer resources to the poor and elderly, they are serving all of us by making our society work better. </p>

<p>So the Democrats and Republicans on the so-called &#8220;Super-Committee&#8221; that is supposed to find $1.2 trillion in budget reductions/increased revenues within a week now thinks it has a solution&#8211;let the regular tax committees (Finance and Ways &#038; Means) come up with the tax revenues, while the Super-Committee will go on and specify the spending cuts.  See <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/14/us/politics/panel-seeks-way-to-reach-a-deal-on-tax-increase.html">Deficit Panel Seeks to Defer Details on Raising Taxes</a>, New York Times (Nov. 14, 2011).</p>
<p>The proposal doesn&#8217;t sound like anything that the Dems on the panel should accept.  For a piddling reduction in some of the deductions available to the most affluent individuals, the GOP is willing to lower the rate on those individuals to 28%!  Just more enriching the rich.  The Dems shouldn&#8217;t agree to that.  Especially since Grover Norquist thinks that any such agreement would be undone immediately, while any stupid agreement the Dems make to &#8220;reforming&#8221; (i.e., cutting benefits from) the earned benefits programs will be allowed to take place.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Grover G. Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform, whose antitax pledge has been signed by most Republicans in Congress, said in an interview, “I am not losing any sleep” over the Republicans’ latest proposal. Mr. Norquist said he was confident that, “at the end of the day, the Republican House will not pass a tax increase.”</p>
<p>“As a face-saving measure,” Mr. Norquist said, the deficit reduction panel “could give lots of instructions to the tax-writing committees.” In complying with those instructions, he said, the House and the Senate could pass very different bills.  Id.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is hard to see why any cuts to the earned benefits programs should be made. Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are more important now than ever because of the weak economy.  We are a rich country and we can afford these programs.Tax 100% of compensation for Social Security.   And treat all profits interests as compensation income when allocations are received, so that partnerships treat persons as partners only when they have a capital investment in the partnership business.</p>
<p>Let the military be cut at least $750 billion.  And raise the rest through taxes&#8211;especially through a progressive estate tax and through eliminating the character preference for capital gains income. </p>
<p>This country is tired of being held hostage by far-right radicals  who don&#8217;t understand that the government acts for the people and who don&#8217;t give a damn for anybody that isn&#8217;t in the top 20% of the income and wealth distribution.  We are tired of the radical right&#8217;s anarchistic actions to prevent the government from borrowing money to carry out important programs.  We are tired of the radical right&#8217;s stupidity about the economy and its reliance on ideological beliefs in &#8220;trickle down&#8221; programs to justify tax cuts no matter what situation the country is in.  We are tired of the radical right&#8217;s refusal to acknowledge the facts about the failures of the four-decade experiment with reaganomics, during which time the large multinational corporations have been allowed to function like quasi-sovereigns.  We are tired of seeing tax policies that support consolidation of corporate empires and movement of business overseas, while Americans lose jobs and watch their wages decline.</p>

<p>GOP wants to repeal Dodd-Frank: instead they should listen to Nassim Taleb
<p>Nassim Taleb, the author of the book on long-tail events, suggests in a Nov. 6, 2011 op-ed in the New York Times that &#8220;it is only a matter of time before private risktaking leads to another giant bailout like the ones the United States was forced to provide in 2008.&#8221; </p>
<p>That&#8217;s pretty strong language, and should be cause for worry among those GOP debaters who have been in a pissing contest over how much legislation they can suggest for repeal, like Dodd-Frank, health care reform, and environmental protection.  Instead of defending big banks, the GOP should start thinking about how to break them up.  Instead of suggesting that we need to repeal Dodd-Frank and end regulation of banks, Taleb says we do need  regulation but can&#8217;t depend on it alone: &#8220;Supervision, regulation, and other forms of monitoring are necessary, but insufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p>And instead of defending risk-taking bankers as innovators and entrepreneurs, Congress should be considering measures to undo the incentives for risk taking.  Taleb says&#8211;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/08/opinion/end-bonuses-for-bankers.html">End Bonuses for Bankers</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>[I]t&#8217;s time for a fundamental reform:  Any person who works for a company that, regardless of its current financial health, would require a taxpayer-financed bailout if it failed, should not get a bonus, ever.  In fact, all pay at systemically important financial institutions&#8211;big banks, but also some insurance companies and even huge hedge funds&#8211;should be strictly regulated.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bonuses are particularly dangerous because they invite bankers to game the system by hiding the risks of rare and hard-to-predict but consequential blow-ups, which I have called &#8216;black swan&#8217; events. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems like sound advice.  Bonuses encourage risktaking, and risktaking encourages breakdowns of TBTF banks.  Breakdowns lead to taxpayer bailouts.  To break the chain, deny the bonuses.</p>
<blockquote><p>The asymmetric nature of the bonus (an incentive for success without a corresponding disincentive for failure) causes hidden risks to accmumlate in the financial system and become a catalyst for disaster.  This violates the fundamental rules of capitalism:  Adam Smith himself was wary of the effect of limiting liability, a bedrock principle of the modern corporation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here Taleb touches on a factor in the expanding risk of our economy&#8211;and the expanding immunity of the manager class from the risk they cause.  Corporations provide limited liability to their owners.  And innovations over the last few decades have expanded limited liability to almost all investors even in pass-through entities that pay no entity-level tax, through the limited liability company and the limited liability partnerships. That is one of the reasons I have argued for Congress to enact legislation to restrain the availability of tax-free mergers and reorganizations.  The combination of easily attained limited liability plus easily attained consolidation of entities has been a factor in the growth of the corporatist state.</p>
<p>Taleb has a good point about the incidence of bonuses in the US market system as well.</p>
<blockquote><p>We trust military and homeland secrutiy personnel with our lives, yet we don&#8217;t give them lavish bonuses.  They get promotions and the honor of a job well done if they succeed, and the severe disincentive of shame if they fail.  For bankers, it is the opposite: a bonus if they make short-term profits and a bailout if they go bust.</p>
</blockquote>
<p> Eliminating bonuses would make banking boring again, like it was before the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.  Boring, in this case, is good.  Congress should consider what kind of legislation could be designed to make bonuses in banking less likely, through tax disincentives or other means.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve noted in these postings the growing inequality between rich and the rest of us in America, and that is the appropriate backdrop against which to investigate further the right&#8217;s smoke-and-mirrors scams about tax policy and earned benefits.  Let me remind you with Kevin Drum&#8217;s Mother Jones article on <a href="http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/10/price-plutocracy-0">The Price of Plutocracy</a>: &#8220;<strong><em>For all practical purposes, every year about $700 billion in income is being sucked directly out of the hands of the poor and the middle class and shoveled into the hands of the rich</em>.</strong>&#8221; (That sentence is illustrated with a great chart, with data drawn from Joseph Hacker of Yale and Paul Pierson of Berkeley, the authors of Winner-Take-All Politics, a book I highly recommend.)</p>
<p>The national debate about deficits has been part of a relentless push by the right to reduce as much as possible the New Deal earned benefit programs of Social Security and Medicare. The right twists the facts to suit the arguments it wants to make.  Krugman hones in on this issue, noting Dean Baker&#8217;s similar anger at the Washington Post&#8217;s inconsistency in considering Social Security in a recent article by Post writer Lori Montgomery, who seems to be miming for the hard right, anti-New Deal crowd in Washington .  See Krugman, <a href="http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/30/social-security-bait-and-switch-a-continuing-series/">Social Security, Bait and Switch, a Continuing Series</a>, New York Times (Oct. 30, 2011).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Social Security is a program that is part of the federal budget, but is by law supported by a dedicated source of revenue. This means that there are two ways to look at the program’s finances: in legal terms, or as part of the broader budget picture.</em></p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<p><em>In legal terms, the program is funded not just by today’s payroll taxes, but by accumulated past surpluses — the trust fund. If there’s a year when payroll receipts fall short of benefits, but there are still trillions of dollars in the trust fund, what happens is, precisely, nothing — the program has the funds it needs to operate, without need for any Congressional action.</em></p>
<p><em>Alternatively, you can think about Social Security as just part of the federal budget. But in that case, it’s just part of the federal budget; it doesn’t have either surpluses or deficits, no more than the defense budget.</em></p>
<p><em>Both views are valid, depending on what questions you’re trying to answer.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What you can’t do is insist that the trust fund is meaningless, because SS is just part of the budget, then claim that some crisis arises when receipts fall short of payments, because SS is a standalone program</em>.</strong>  Id. (emphasis added).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Further, the right refers to these programs as &#8220;entitlements&#8221;, a term that is meant to dredge up resentments against those who have some rights to benefits from these programs.  The right uses &#8220;personal responsibility&#8221; and &#8220;entitlements&#8221; as though they refer to two non-intersecting worlds, whereas in fact the opposite is true.</p>
<p>Workers pay into Social Security to support current workers who paid into it in the past.  The trust fund was established, and amended with a good deal of actuarial research under Reagan in 1983, with the knowledge that the baby boom generation would be passing through and create a bulge of benefit needs and that US birth rates tended to be smaller now than they were a century ago.  In other words.  what is happening now in terms of the baby boomer population reaching retirement age and the decline in US birthrates was exactly the information on which the Social Security changes made in the 1980s were predicated.  Either we believe that these kinds of predictions are reasonable (in which case it is utterly silly to raise nightmare scenarioes about bankruptcy, because there is nothing of the sort) or we believe that it is impossible to predict for sure what will happen (in which case it is utterly silly to raise nightmare scenarios about Social Security bankruptcy, because GDP could grow just a little faster than predicted, easing all future problems, or boomer needs could grow just a little less than predicted, easing all future problems).  Either way, the crisis-bell ringing being done by the right as a way to attribute deficits to Social Security is a smoke and mirrors scam.</p>
<p>It is even more so since the Social Security trust fund is invested in US Treasuries and those Treasuries plus new tax funds coming in pay all the benefit costs.  Is the US going to default on Treasuries.  Well, if so, we have a bigger problem with Japan and China not liking that&#8211;not just the Social Security trust fund.  The hard right seems to think it is okay to play political games with US debt, but American citizens should be aware that this is what they are doing.</p>
<p>For a good overall exposition of these issues, see the article in  Salon by Gene Lyons, <a href="http://www.salon.com/2011/11/03/how_the_rich_created_the_social_security_crisis/?source=newsletter">How the Rich Created the Social Security &#8216;Crisis&#8217;</a> (Nov. 3, 2011) (noting the &#8220;decades-long propaganda war against America’s most efficient, successful and popular social insurance program&#8221;).</p>
<blockquote><p><em>[T]his is the beneficiaries’ money, invested by the Social Security trustees in U.S. Treasury bonds drawn upon “the full faith and credit of the United States.” <strong>Far from being “meaningless IOUs” as right-wing cant has it, they represent the same legally binding promise between the U.S. government and its people that it makes with Wall Street banks and the Chinese government, which also hold Treasury Bonds</strong>.</em></p>
<p><em>A promise not very different, the Daily Howler’s Bob Somerby points out, from the one implicit in your bank statement or 401K (if you’re lucky enough to have one). Did you think the money was buried in earthen jars filled with gold bullion and precious stones?  Id. (emphasis added).</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>One might add that many of our multinational corporations that are currently lobbying heavily for yet another tax break in the form of a &#8220;repatriation holiday&#8221; for their offshored, untaxed profits actually have the substantial portion of those profits invested in those same U.S. Treasury notes.  So, as ataxingmatter has noted before, much of that money is already in the US and repatriation will generally not be of much benefit merely from bringing cash back to go through the US economy.  As the article notes, allowing repatriation would lead to corporations dumping about a trillion of US Treasuries on the market, and likely cause a rise in the interest rate the US government must pay to borrow.  Not a win-win situation.  IN fact, clearly a loss for the US government and the majority of US taxpayers, both in Treasury interest rates and in lost corporate tax revenues.</p>

<p>Infrastructure gamesmanship puts wealthy ahead of jobs, good bridges, and country
<p>For those who are paying attention to the House and Senate these days, it seems like a frustrating exercise.  Mostly it is one of watching the &#8220;do-nothing&#8221; Republicans find excuses for never requiring millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share of taxes while making up excuses for not doing anything of the varied real approaches to stimulating the economy in ways that will create jobs for ordinary Americans.</p>
<p>Take the vote on the infrastructure bills.  The Senate leadership asked the Senate to vote for funding $60 billion of much needed infrastructure projects (just a tip of the iceberg of everything that is needed to bring this country&#8217;s infrastructure into nonembarassment).  The GOP refused, because it was funded by a de minimis tax on millionaires. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s no end to things that can be said about this further evidence of the craven state of the GOP in the US today.  Political advantage for the wealthy class is to be given primary importance, no matter what happens to the vast majority of Americans and the country we all love.  Jim Maule has it right, in <a href="http://www.mauledagain.blogspot.com/">The Tax and Spending Stalemate: Can It Destroy the Nation?</a>, MauledAgain (Nov. 7, 2011).</p>
<p>  <a name="more"></a><br />
<blockquote>
<p>When partisan loyalties mean more than the nation’s well-being, when money means more to wealthy “world citizens” than does the long-term physical security of the nation, and when protection of millionaires who fund campaign treasure chests means more than the lives and safety of the rest of America, the literal physical survival of the nation is imperiled. &#8230;</p>
<p>[A]s long as this absurd tax and spending stalemate continues, where decisions are not made on the merits of the issue but on the partisan attachments of supposedly public servants, the nation and its infrastructure, the nation and the health of its citizens, the nation and its economy, will continue to stagnate, deteriorate, and crumble. The question now is how close we are to the point of no return.</p>

<p>Nader Argues for a Financial Transactions Tax
<p>Ralph Nader provided an op-ed on the question of a financial transaction tax, &#8220;Time for a Tax on Speculation,&#8221; Wall St. Journal, A17 (Nov. 2, 2011).  He ties the need for the tax as a curb to speculation to the growing concern among ordinary Americans about corporate power and Wall Street excesses.</p>
<p>A financial transactions tax would impose a small charge on the value of stock, bond and derivatives transactions&#8211;probably somewhere around 0.25% to 0.5% (the latter is the figure pushed by Nader and groups like National Nurses United). Such a tax would raise a considerable amount of money and at the same time serve another important function&#8211;curbing speculative and high-frequency trading.</p>
<blockquote><p>[This tax] has the potential to curb risky speculative trading that contributes little real economic value.  The Capital Institute&#8217;s John Fullerton has stated that a financial speculation tax could have a significant impact on the high-frequency trading and other &#8216;quant&#8217; trading strategies that now comprise an astonishing 70% of vastly bloated equity-trading volume. <a name="more"></a> Over the past few decades, trading volume has grown exponentially.  In 1995, the total shares of stock traded on the Nasdaq and the NYSE, not including derivates and other options, was 188 billion.  By the peak of the financial crisis, in 2008, this annual number had skyrocketed to three trillion.</p>
<p>*** Sen. Harkin, Rep. DeFazio and others in the past few years have proposed protecting ordinary investors from the direct effects of the tax by providing exemptions for mutual funds, retirement funds and for the first $100,000 in trades made annually by an individual</p>

<p>The right&#8217;s nutty claims about job creation&#8211;Gingrich and the estate tax
<p>The right is busy selling its program for enriching the rich to the working class.  As usual, the sales pitches are full of false and nutty claims pitched to fool hard workers who are uninformed about the facts.</p>
<p>Newt Gingrich, for example, pitched the claim that eliminating the estate tax that applies only to the biggest multimillion dollar estates&#8211;a large tax cut applicable only to the uberrich silver-spoon kids who do nothing to earn the largesse&#8211;will cause all kinds of wondrous economic changes.   See &#8220;To create Jobs, abolish the death tax now&#8221; (The Newt Gingrich Letter).</p>
<p>These claims are based on a  so-called &#8220;study&#8221; by the American Family Business Foundation (put in quotes, since this is a paid &#8220;study&#8221; by  a propaganda tank that asks family businesses of the kind that might have to pay the tax whether they would create more jobs if they didn&#8217;t have to pay the tax, and gets the not at all unsurprising self-serving answer that &#8220;oh yes, we&#8217;d have more jobs with fewer taxes&#8221;.)   So the study and Gingrich make pie-in-the-sky claims that</p>
<p> <a name="more"></a>
<ul>
<li>the US government would actually take in more tax revenues by getting rid of the millionaires &#038; billionaires&#8217; estate tax&#8211;even claiming a specific number of $362 billion more in taxes.  (It helps if the persons answering the self-serving survey give numbers that can be used to make these specific type of claims.) </li>
<li>Gross Domestic Product would increase by 2.26% just by eliminating the tax </li>
<li>New revenues from the &#8220;economic activity that would result from the elimination of the [estate] tax&#8221; would be twice as much as the revenue gained from the current estate tax; </li>
<li>the economic growth from eliminating the estate tax would &#8220;create thousands of new jobs as families kept more small businesses running through mutliple generations and shifted their efforts from avoiding estate taxes to investing in America&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Balderdash</p>
<p>Eliminating the estate tax won&#8217;t create new economic growth, new investment in jobs, save family businesses or divert monies now spent on tax evasion to worthwhile domestic investments.  Most of the claims in articles like Gingrich&#8217;s or in &#8220;studies&#8221; like the self-serving American Family Business Foundation are unfounded, based on absurd assumptions or simply made up.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Estate tax reduction or repeal doesn&#8217;t lead to growth</strong>.  We have cut taxes on estates enormously in the last decade and growth has stagnated, with none of the benefits going to the vast middle and lower classes.  There&#8217;s no empirical evidence supporting the self-serving claims that such a tax cut helps growth.  In fact, evidence on inequality in societies supports exactly the opposite conclusion&#8211;the more we allow spendthrift heirs to take over family fortunes tax free and accumulate even more wealth, the worse it is for economic growth and societal wellbeing. </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax reduction or repeal doesn&#8217;t create jobs</strong>.  Money saved from taxes doesn&#8217;t automatically get plowed back into businesses in a way that creates jobs.  It&#8217;s more likely to get plowed into private equity funds (that strip companies of their employees and load them up with debt in order to resell them at great gain for the equity investors and great loss of jobs) or invested in emerging market economies to diversify portfolios.  Most use of excess funds by the wealthy, that is, benefits the wealthy at little or no good to society and in fact often with considerable harm to society in terms of job loss </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax repeal doesn&#8217;t &#8220;save&#8221; family businesses, because they aren&#8217;t at risk from the estate tax in the first place.</strong>  Very Very few (if any) family businesses are lost to the estate tax.  There is a provision in the Code allowing installment payments over 14 years to ensure that family farms can stay in business by paying the estate tax out of annual incomes.  The argument about loss of family businesses is invented to appeal to those who do not understand the very limited number of estates subject to the tax in the first place (fewer than 2%). </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax repeal doesn&#8217;t prevent sales of family businesses upon death of the founder&#8211;and those sales are often a good thing!</strong>  Many times, family businesses are sold upon the death of the founder because nobody in the family wants to run it anymore&#8211;they want to take their cash and go live their own lives.   That&#8217;s probably not a bad result for the economy&#8211;new management will tend to see opportunities that the old business had ignored.  All repeal of the estate tax would do would be to put more money in the hands of heirs who do nothing to deserve it. </li>
<li><strong>Estate tax repeal isn&#8217;t needed to avoid &#8220;double taxation.&#8221;</strong>  Gingrich tries to make the case, quoting Petter Ferrara as follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;The [estate] tax taxes yet again a lifetime of savings and investment that has already been taxed multiple times.  It is double taxation on top of double taxation, which often forces loved ones left behind to sell the family farm, ranch or business to pay the taxes just when they are suffering from their loss the most.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not so.  Many estates have as their primary assets investment securities that represent considerable appreciation that has NEVER been taxed.  Elimination of the estate tax means that even this &#8220;last chance&#8221; for getting a single tax bite would be eliminated.  Many of the biggest estates represent passage of stock from one generation to another with almost no taxation along the way.  Whereas workers pay tax on every single dollar earned and have little ability to use their salaries as collateral for big investment plays, wealthy heirs of financial assets can use their assets as collateral for loans to &#8220;monetize&#8221; their wealth without taxation.  Most substantial family farms and ranches are now incorporated, with use of various schemes to zero out corporate income and pay no taxes (especially, e.g., depreciation of equipment and &#8220;salaries&#8221; for family members and corporate ownership of personal residences resulting in widespread ability to deduct personal expenses not possible to ordinary wage workers).  Double taxation is a fabricated myth for most of these estates.  As Leona Helmsley famously stated&#8211;only little people pay taxes.</p>
<p>And of course, as already noted, the sales are usually because they WANT to sell, since family farms have 14 years in which to use the income from the business to pay off any (usually small) estate tax due.  Remember that the effective estate tax rate is usually very very low, given the very large current exemption amount.  Only the estate above the multi-million dollar exemption amount is subject to tax, and the rate right now is inordinately low and there are numerous accepted and simple mechanisms, such as family limited partnerships and other devices, which result in much lower evaluations than fair market value under current warped rules.</p>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<p><strong>Meanwhile, it is important to note the many beneficial effects of the estate tax:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>the estate tax provides revenues to help combat significant budget deficits.  Those deficits have</strong> been substantially created by two problems&#8211;wars being fought without the normal tax increases to fund them, and tax cuts even when those cuts created hundreds of billions of dollars in annual deficits. </li>
<li><strong>the estate tax is a slightly redistributive mechanism to counter the upwards redistribution that is the norm in our current economic system.  </strong>CEOs get golden parachutes for ruining companies, and bankers and managers take all the benefits of worker productivity gains.  Ordinary employees are denied the right to form a union by every employer trick imaginable and by the right&#8217;s unwillingness to let card check become law.  Workers therefore end up scraping by on a combination of devalued wages and debt.</li>
</ul>
<p>Keeping the estate tax, and making it more progressive so that the estates of the uberrich are appropriately taxed under &#8220;ability to pay&#8221; concepts regarding the marginal utility of the dollar, is the fair thing to do. And it would have a stimulative effect on the economy by providing revenues for governmental infrastructure and other projects.  Counter to Gingrich&#8217;s claim, repealing the estate tax would be a further step backward  to the robber barons&#8217; gilded age.  Let&#8217;s not take that step.</p>
